B00008QSAA|5.0|Starting with the chart topping \\"Mississippi Queen\\", Mountain gained temporary monumental success! The song was so good, radio executives ignored the torrid lyrics. With nothing short of incredible lead and acoustic guitar playing, Leslie West shines on this collection with some of the most innovative guitar work of the period. Corky Lang's drums rivaled that of Ginger Baker's of the time and Felix Pappalardi's vocals could be smoothly romantic \\"Theme From An Imaginary Western\\" or wild, as in, \\"Never In My Life\\". \\"For Yasgur's Farm\\" is a wonderful tribute to Woodstock, while \\"To My Friend\\" is an amazing solo work of acoustic picking. \\"Boys In The Band\\" is a grand finale to an all too short album that defined a period of rock and roll without overshadowing it. A must for any true rock fan.
B000HEWEEY|3.0|Warner should be ashamed of itself for calling this an Ultimate edition. <br />They release this on one of the highest capacity media and yet guess what! <br />The original aspect ratio of the movie is lost!!! That means the movie is clipped on the sides. The original movie is 2.55:1, this so called Ultimate version is 2.4:1. <br />%5 of the original width is missing. And you call this an ultimate version, HAHA!
0385340559|5.0|It is rare to simultaneously find strong character development and a great story together. Lee Child does both in this book pretty well. One reviewer was correct that the appearance (from the reader's perspective) of tremendous skill and fascination with numbers and mathematics was distracting however there were enough new character developments in most of the characters to partly compensate. Reacher and his team were getting old and slowing down, which makes them both more human and more believable. Some readers may not like that (understandable) but others may feel that it makes the story more believable. Overall, a great book and a great read!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I loved the series and the information was presented in an exciting and attention-getting way!
075640407X|5.0|This is the kind of novel that fantasy readers dream of reading. It's the kind of novel would-be writers dream of writing. Excellent writing, deeply complex characters, careful revelations and wonderful plot twists. I haven't enjoyed a debut fantasy novel this much since Barry Hughart's \\"Bridge of Birds\\" or Rosemary Kirstein's \\"The Steerswoman.\\"<br /><br />The protagonist, Kvothe, is seemingly hiding as an innkeeper. But there are nasty creatures about, that may or may not be attracted to him. After Kvothe rescues a bard, he ends up telling the bard his life story. So you get the back story on a nearly-mythical wizard, mixed with increasingly dark events happening in the present. It is an extremely effective way to to tell a story. It certainly kept me up all night. And I can truthfully say I savored each of the 660 plus pages.<br /><br />Maybe the best part is that Rothfuss, in his blog, says all three books in the trilogy are written, and will be released at one year intervals. I can't wait.<br /><br />This is about as good as high fantasy gets. An imaginative, powerful and compelling story that is exceptionally well told. My compliments to Mr. Rothfuss. And my very highest recommendation to readers.
B000P0J02E|5.0|Why do the record companies think we like the paper cases? They are cheap and flimsy. I've had this CD for only a few hours, and the case is already showing some wear. <br /> <br />Warner Home Video finally stopped using their \\"snapper\\" cases on DVDs for this very reason.
031286504X|5.0|I picked this book up on a whim, and did not realize it was written over 50 years ago (I was kind of wondering, though, why it was set in the 1970s!). Anyway, needless to say, I was hooked almost instantly. It is such an intelligent book, and the prose is beautiful - full of clever turns of phrase and colorful imagery.<br /><br />I literally had to put the book down a couple of times when I was reading at night, because my heart was pounding and I was afraid I wouldn't get to sleep. Now, I am no newcomer to horror - my aunt gave me a copy of The Shining when I was 10, and I think like The Shining, this book creeped me out deeply - the story really gets into your head.  Now my stepson has been bugging me for the last week to turn my copy over to him so he can read it.<br /><br />It is a brutal story, full of heartbreaking moments, and as others have noticed, the focus on the scientific basis for vampirism draws you in.<br /><br />The additional short stories are a mixed bag, but some quite good - like \\"Prey\\" - I was quite haunted by that one as well.<br /><br />I'm a little afraid to see the Will Smith movie; I'm praying they do a good job with that one. Otherwise, what a waste!
1573226521|5.0|I had heard of this book but only decided to give it a go because it was a perfect partner with You Are Here (Steve Horsfall). The Beach is in many respects a modern version of \\"Lord of the Flies\\". The premise of the story focuses on Richard, a young traveler in search of a hidden beach were there are white sands and clear waters and a life of luxury waiting to be found. Eventually paradise falls apart as more and more discover it. Excellent, I will now try the film although I'm told it's not so good. <br />
1594489505|5.0|Having greatly enjoyed Khaled Hosseini's first novel, The Kite Runner, I looked forward to his second effort with great anticipation and wasn't disappointed. The novel reads like an epic, it traces the stories of two women brought together by destiny - Mariam, the illegitimate child of a rich man, is married off at fifteen to a much older man, and suffers a life of suppression and subjugation and made to feel worthless for not being able to produce an heir. Her life takes an interesting turn years later when a young 14-year-old girl, Laila is brought into her household and made wife number two. The two women forge a bond of sisterhood, united against their oppressor/husband. I will not give too much of the plot away, but suffice to say that not only do we get to read about these two character's amazing and heartbreaking journey through the cruel and oppressive male-dominated world they live in, but we also get a lesson in Afghanistan's history prior to and later during the Soviet Occupation in the 1980s to the Taliban rule where women are reduced to the ranks of chattel ,and deemed mere breeding mares and servants of men. This is a searing portrait of the plight of women in Afghanistan, and not only does it give voice to the victims of male oppression and harsh cultural traditions, but it stands as a testament to the resilience of the human spirit with its unwavering hope.
B000003TAR|5.0|i love this record...i love all of kurt cobains records.  nirvana although shortlived started a grunge revolution.  the pain in kurt's voice is so evident.  the standout tracks on this album are heart shaped box, rape me, frances farmer, dumb, pennyroyal tea and my personal favorite all apologies.  pick up this, nevermind and incesticide to start with and if you like those grab bleach and unplugged.
B000JK8OYU|3.0|If you are looking for a Beatle album, because you like their music and it has always been around you,  Then this album isn't it. <br /> <br />As a long time Beatle fan, I am 50/50 on this one.  I was regularly left with the feeling 'Oh God why did they do that, too that song?'  Couple occasionally with 'That sounds so good,  I can see why they did that!' <br /> <br />Most people I speak too, say they don't like the album as a whole but can pick out bits & pieces that stand out as good.  I can see how this would be a good soundtrack for the C.S. <br /> <br />So in summary, If you want a greatest hits album, Try-  No 1's its a winner.   If you want an album that will collect dust at the back of your collection, Love is it.

B00000163G|5.0|Let's set the stage...Tupac is in jail for a ridiculous sexual assault charge.  Tupac signs a contract with Death Row in exchange for bail, and heads into the studio ready to explode. The result was All Eyez On Me--the embodiment of WestCoast representation and classic rap material.  Since this album took about 2 weeks to create, the material is fresh and raw.  At the pinnacle of his career and in his intellectual prime, a no holds barred superior track set-up establishes this cd at the top of the food chain. <br /> <br />Ambitionz az a Ridah, Only God Can Judge Me and All Eyez On Me, 2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted ft. Snoop (arguably one of the best gangster songs ever) reflect his intellectual superiority, warrior mentality,  and gang affiliation... <br /> <br />How Do U Want It, Skandalouz, All Bout U are classic dance tracks involving his attitudes about different types of women. <br /> <br />California Love (awesome beats with Dr. Dre)! <br /> <br />Check it out and read the lyrics when you listen.
B00024I2Z4|4.0|This is probably one of my favorite Disney movies. (This and Emperor's New Groove). I love when Disney has a sense of humor and you can clearly see it in this one.
B000NDIAWY|4.0|If you want some easy listening tunes, this cd is for you. Of course, you also have to enjoy country and folk-style music, but I will say the twang and \\"country-esque\\" licks are understated in the album. The lyrics were also different; deep and thoughtful, there is a definite poetic flair to the words, in contrast with the usual \\"my boyfriend cheated on me with my best friend's sister's cousin\\" lyrics. A plus for getting you in the contemplative mood...
0312360266|5.0|Zoey Redbird's life changes forever the day she is MARKED.  Once being tagged by a vampyre tracker, she can no longer remain in her home but instead has to move to the House of Night.  However, Zoey finds out very quickly that her mark is different from that of the other vampyre fledglings.  The Goddess Nyx has special plans for Zoey.... <br /> <br />     Do not start reading MARKED late at night as I guarantee you will not get any sleep until you finish this book!  P.C. Cast and Kristin Cast have written a tale that is a hit from the very first sentence.  Not only is MARKED an engaging story, but the fresh perspective on vampyres makes this one of the best vampyre tales I've ever read. <br /> <br />     MARKED is targeted for the young adult audience.  However, adults are absolutely going to love this one as well!  One word of caution, however.  Some of the themes may be a bit too extreme for younger teenagers as Zoey very openly discusses certain sexual acts and drinking blood.  However, older teenagers will appreciate Zoey's attitude while parents will appreciate the integrity of Zoey's character.  In fact, P.C. Cast and Kristin Cast are to be commended for the phenomenal job they did with creating Zoey's character as her voice sounds loud and clear throughout this superb story. <br /> <br />     MARKED is a must buy for all fans of vampyre tales.  P.C. Cast already has a reputation for crafting quality stories and her first effort with her daughter may be her best yet.  MARKED is easily recommended! <br /> <br />COURTESY OF CK2S KWIPS AND KRITIQUES
B000AA305M|5.0|If anyone can sound hot on their album, it would have to be David Gray. Cadence, gritty tone, deliberate phrasing of each line-- you can really FEEL what he's singing. This album (from what I understand) is heavier instrumentally, and has an orchestral sound. In my opinion, a beautiful accompaniment to Gray's voice, which can stand prefectly stand alone as well. A must buy!!!
6305922756|5.0|One of the funniest movies ever made ! I won't add to the product descriptions,plenty of reviews for that.But I will add some observations. <br />  I've lived in Austin,Tx ,\\"The Live Music Capitol of the World\\" ,for the past 30 years, & have known many in the music scene .And no one loves this movie more than the musicians that it skewers.Especially the metal acts . If you ever want to crack one of them up,drop a line from Spinal Tap .Everyone will end up quoting their own favorite line.The smart ones see the joke/danger.The others don't make it and/or end up as jokes themselves. <br />    Second thing is,the \\"in character\\"voice commentaries alone are worth the  price for any fan wondering why to buy this edition.It is just as brilliant in concept as the movie itself. <br />    Third thing.Spinal Tap was obviously based on several bands and an entire genre to a degree.But my favorite candidate for \\"most based on\\" is the '70's band Uriah Heep.They were famous for changing drummers,even changing in mid-album once.I'm a child of the 70's and still listen to them occasionaly.But now I can't keep the grin off my face & keep thinking of that thin,fine line between stupid & clever.Long live Rock 'N Roll !! <br />
B000MRAAJW|5.0|I've given the Planet Earth DVD 5 stars because the cable broadcast of the work is so compelling.  I can only wait to actually see it in High Definition.  Alas, that is the rest of this story. <br /> <br />Owning a shiny new HD TV (Sony Bravia) and a tenured DVD player I opted to purchase the HD version of the Planet Earth series.  Here is where I made my mistake (and Amazon too!) <br /> <br />I did not understand that only HD DVD players can play a HD DVD.  Your ordinary DVD player simply can't read the new technology on the HD DVD.  Period.   <br /> <br />OK, it does say so, in the very fine print on the back of the DVD case.  Why with 10X reading glasses I might have even noticed.  But no where on the ordering process on teh Amazon web site is this requirement brought to my attention.  <br /> <br />Sure, snicker, you video-philes who are early adopters and know this implicitly.  But trust me, I have talked to at least a dozen people who like me didn't have a clue.  And not one person I have discussed this with was aware of the DVD shortcoming with HD DVD format.   <br /> <br />So, just hop out and buy an HD DVD player you say.  They don't cost that much.  Wrong, the lowest price I found using on-line vednors IE.g., Amazon, Costco) was $430 then jumping to $700 for the second lowest priced option.  Not your ordinary DVD player price is it?   <br /> <br />So go slow, if you have the TV but not the player.  My advice: Wait til Christmas, the prices always come down a notch.   <br />
0151012768|4.0|I bought this book on a whim because the title appealed to me.  The content is a wonderful mix of management gobble-de-gook, spirituality, and soul-searching set within almost alive landscapes. The character development of the 3 main protagonists is superb, as it is of the secondary members...witness Mary Jones the intrepid economist/banker, the gillie Colin McPherson, and the super-crawly Peter Maxwell.  An excellent book that is hard to put down.   <br />
B0000639FE|4.0|Jerry Maguire (Tom Cruise) is a sports agent who has an epiphany one day about having \\"less clients, less money\\". This soon leads to him getting fired from his agency and he his down to one demanding football-playing client Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding Jr.) and a secretary Dorothy Boyd (Rene Zellweger) who takes the plunge and comes with him.<br /><br />Jerry Maguire is a great romantic comedy filled with warmth and humour and characters you really care about. Underappreciated at time of release this is actually one of the great film comedies of the 1990's.<br /><br />Jerry Maguire is perfectly cast. Tom Cruise and Cuba Gooding Jr are simply brilliant and their interplay provides the real highlights of the film - making the most of a brilliant script. The film lags a little bit in the second half and Cruise and Zellweger's romance is not entirely convincing but this is still great compared to most comedies these days.<br /><br />Sadly, the commentary included on the DVD with the director and his three leads is a waste of time. It is a self-indulgent, back-slapping session of the very worst kind with insights on the level of \\"I loved that scene\\", \\"you were great in the scene\\", \\"awesome\\", etc, etc. Very disapointing as I was interested in gaining some insights on the making of this great film. Hopefully in a few year's time Crowe will produce a proper commentary that befits the film.<br /><br />The DVD does include a pretend Reebok commercial that is worth seeing with Cuba, but otherwise you could save your money and just buy the one-disc edition.

I've only heard one song.<br /><br />My kids been telling me about John Mayer forever but he fell in the cracks so to speak.<br /><br />I finally heard I Can't Trust Myself (With Loving You) and I'm playing it over and over and over.  Believe it or not, I am purchasing the entire CD just for that song.  I have a feeling I will not be disappointed.
0156421178|3.0|\\"Homage to Catalonia\\" is a memoir of George Orwell's experiences during the Spanish Civil War. A committed socialist, Orwell was right in the thick of the action fighting on the side of the doomed Republic.<br /><br />The book is at its best when it gives Orwell's first-hand account of life as a soldier, but is less compelling when he attempts to explain the complicated Republican politics, rivally, and in-fighting of the time.<br /><br />Orwell's socialist politics also seem rather naive these days, given what has happened in the intervening 70 years.<br /><br />Interesting for its personal insights, but read Anthony Beevor's great book for a comprehensive history of the Spanish Civil War.
B00005JPAO|5.0|The Queen was a fantastic depiction of the way that Queen Elizabeth may have felt following the death of Princess Diana.  Despite all of the media hype about the latter, this movie is new, fresh and surprisingly funny.  I laughed out loud a number of times both at the Queen and with her.<br /><br />How can an apple become an orange?  That's what Elizabeth had to do after the sudden and shocking death of her son's ex-wife, whom she had never liked to begin with.  A reserved, imminently proper woman, Elizabeth was completely out of touch with the need of the public to grieve.  She wanted to mourn privately but didn't understand that the country lost Diana too and had to have more closure.  Although she wanted a private service, she needed to bend and come round to something that eventually included pop stars like Elton John -- a 180° turn that was most difficult for her.<br /><br />As always, Helen Mirren is nothing short of amazing.  I've loved her since her early days in Prime Suspect and have watched every episode!  She doesn't disappoint here either; neither does the character who plays Tony Blair, whose name escapes me at the moment.<br /><br />Acting is great, story is wonderful.  Only question I had was the reliability of the details and facts -- were those leaked by palace insiders?  Interesting to know... This is a movie I could watch two or three times and probably will!<br /><br />Sigridmac
B00005MP58|5.0|All I have to say is excellent!  I fell in love when I first watched the movie on A and E.  I stayed up for the three days it aired and had to buy it.  This cast, the scenery, if ever there was a perfect movie.  This is it.  All of the others, are horrendous.  Colin is excellent.
0517201658|4.0|The Thorn Birds (TTB) is about Meggie Cleary and Ralph di Brisscart.  Meggie Cleary is the only girl in a Cleary family dominated by men.  When Meggie is 10 the Cleary's move to Austrailia from New Zealand for a great job opportunity.  At this time Meggie meets Ralph di Brisscart - a priest.  Their love for one another at first seems quiet harmless as she is 10 and he is 28 but as she turns into a women and doesn't understand why she can't have Ralph to herself as her husband their love for one another is tested by distance, time apart, and decisions that they each make in their lives.<br /><br />Set in the back drop of the Austrailian outback, TTB covers a 25 year time span and 3 generations of Cleary's.  The book touches on important world events such as, WWI and WWII in the back drop at points.  And also delves into two important issues: religion (and it's roles in society)and philosophy, beliefs, morals (and their role combined with religion in society.)<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book and was enraptured with the Cleary's due to the amazing character description of the author.  She brings you to Drogheda Farm and makes you understand what life is like for each and every member of this family and their surrounding neighbors and friends. I also enjoyed the manner in which the book was written:  broken down into time frames marked by certain years and from a specific characters point of view, thus giving the reader a chance to better get to know that character and their role in the story.<br /><br />While I enjoyed this book, it didn't blow me out of the water the way other books have.  I would recommend this book as a definite good read however, I don't know that I would say it was a MUST read.
0790736918|4.0|A second look at this film is long overdue. It's been hailed by many as a masterpiece. Even the anti-Ford critic David Thomson in The New Biographical Dictionary of Film classifies it as an exceptional work. I don't know whether it's the Ford mystique, the Wayne icon, or the mesmerizing beauty of Monument Valley that holds this movie to a different standard from most Westerns. But something is at work that numbs an eye-level scrutiny. The Searchers is a good film, but no masterpiece, and certainly does not belong in the American Film Institute's list of all-time top films. A brief look at some of the more obvious defects:    Ford makes picture postcards out of the soaring spires and buttes. At no point does he come to grips with the real harshness of the terrain. This is desert country. Hardly anything grows-- just scope out the sparseness of greenery. Yet we're told cattle herds feed here in large enough numbers to support families, (In the movie, Jorgensen's right--  they would be better off raising pigs than cattle). Also, there is no hint of extreme desert heat or cold affecting anything or anybody. The parties go here and there with slim regard for what the conditions actually afford. In short, the celebrated landscape amounts to little more than a majestic backdrop without a true reality of its own. Ford may love this Spartan terrain, but he gives it scant respect.    Similarly, the film-maker undercuts the naturalism of the vaunted visuals. The audience gets an awesome flow of natural wonders, only to have the flow interrupted by outdoor sets so painfully obvious, they can't be ignored, (consider the Futterman ambush scene, for one). As a result, visual continuity is sacrificed and so is fidelity to the intended atmosphere. Suddenly we're jolted out of the scenic spell back into recognition that this is, after all, only a movie. Where, one wonders, was Ford's very real poetic eye in these disruptive scenes, and why didn't he insist on shooting all outdoor scenes outdoors-- especially after traveling to Colorado for the great snow scenes. As a premier film-maker, I'm sure he had the clout. Nonetheless, the lapse is another glaring defect.    There's another problem with respect, this time for the adversary. In fact, the Indians do get some concessions--Scar is provided a moment of motivation and a good sarcastic aside-- but not much else. As in Ford's cavalry cycle, aboriginal peoples still exist as convenient devices and sitting ducks. From the film's several battles, it appears the Indians know nothing about  combat tactics. Stupidly, they never attack unless an escape route is left open to the fleeing settlers. And when they attack frontally across the river or in front of the cave, they mass in a bunch so the dug-in whites can hardly miss. No wonder there are so few Indians left. In most Westerns, this cliche would not even merit comment, but remember this one's supposed to be a \\"masterpiece\\". (For a gauge of Ford's dishonesty, compare his cardboard warriors with the skilled and savvy combatants in the similarly themed \\"Ulzana's Raid\\" {1973}).    For what is required of the actors, contrast the first ten minutes with the movie's remainder. Those first few minutes are little short of superb. There's a low-key naturalism and subtlety that's fascinating-- Just who is Ethan Edwards? What is the tension between his brother and him? And where did he get that impressive war medal? The well-crafted impression is that of real people concealing true feelings, while groping toward some kind of reconciliation across unspoken barriers. Then Ward Bond and the posse arrive and slam-bang stereotypes take over. The promising beginning is lost, while Ford reverts to form by replacing character with caricature. Bond, for example, is not just a gruff old man, but  The Gruff Old Man; Jeffrey Hunter is not just a callow youth, but The Callow Youth; and most egregiously, Ken Curtis is not one more country yokel, but The Rub-your-Nose-In-It Country Yokel. Moreover, conversation ceases, hat-throwing and bellowing take over, and genuine interaction gives way to exaggerated personalities doing little more than bouncing off one another. Even Wayne's one-note avenger comes close to parody, (unlike others, however, he is never mocked). Of course, such caricatures provide ample grist for Ford's broad idea of humor. Nonetheless, the comic set-ups come perilously close at times to a Three Stooges level, particularly the scenes with Old Mose, and with Bond and Patrick Wayne. I'm not against comic relief, but I am when it flirts with burlesque in an otherwise serious film.    More could be pointed out, such as the distracting subplots, or the ludicrous wedding sequence, or most glaringly, the climax with its sudden, unmotivated change of heart-- after all, it's the racial conflict that drives the plot. I guess what really bothers me is how blithely Ford substitutes his own highly simplistic vision of the Old West for any really plausible version. There's a basic lack of respect for the material, which allows, for example, such facile touches as Jorgensen's unweathered two-story wooden house in the middle of the desert, or Vera Miles' brocaded form-fitting wedding gown that appears to have been flown in from Paris. My point is not that the film lacks merit-- the justly celebrated doorway shots, for example. Rather, it's one of perspective--  this is an entertaining film but far from a masterpiece.The Searchers may be lauded and popular with many. Nonetheless, beneath the glossy surface lies an under-developed theme that really deserved better than standard stock company treatment. In short, Thomson is wrong. The Searchers is not an exception to Ford's usual product. Rather, it's just a little less compromised.
B000NVIGC0|4.0|It seems that Wilco is catching a bunch of flack over their new album \\"Sky Blue Sky\\". Why this has come about, I'm not sure. No, the album is not \\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot\\", nor \\"Being There\\" but is this a bad thing. Why would you want a band to put out a record that sounds the same as it previous records. Leave that to Good Charlotte or some other pop band. Never has Wilco put out an album that sounds like it's others. So the fact that people are displeased with the new record say \\"Where did Wilco go?\\" makes no sense. There right there in the record.  <br />The new record has gone with a more soulful approach. This should come as no suprise for anyone who has been to a show of theirs in the past year of two. For evidence of this look no further that the Charles Wright cover \\"Comment (If all men are truley brothers)on the \\"Kicking Television\\" album. But don't be fooled, the soul isn't a gimmick or a marketing ploy. This is not Aerosmith's \\"Honkin' on Bobo\\". <br />Musically, it is one of the best, at least as composition is concerned. The guitar trio in \\"Impossible German\\" is beautiful and economic, not flashy, not boring. Glen Kotche puts some of his best work to date on this record, playing to the songs, keeping things simple when it suits the song and only embellishing on the trap when the song requires a push. The triplet bass drum beat in track 5 is a great example of this. <br />Nels Cline puts in some great work throughout the album, using his jazz background to further enhance the soulfulness of the album. <br />I can understand that, and somewhat agree with those who say that this album doesn't \\"rock\\" like some of the other Wilco albums. Yet, that still depends on what you consider \\"rock\\". Rock doesn't have to involve huge dynamics and shredding guitar solos. If it did, hair bands would still rule the world. But they don't, and I don't hear to many people complaining.  <br />This album may not be for everyone, but Wilco shouldn't have to take crap for trying todo something different, they should be commended. If you like the old stuff better, well...THEN LISTEN TO THE OLD STUFF. Frankly, it would be quite pathetic if Wilco sounded the same on every album, comming across as some 21st century \\"The Who\\" writting songs about being a teenager when their 55 years old, but they don't. They go out on a limb to acheive a particular type of sound every album, and they execute this quite well.
B00028493Y|5.0|So one night when the wife was away i decided to bring some easy on the eyes, hollywood pap, home with me from the video store where i worked.  I picked the girl next door based purely on the picture on the cover.  I didn't want something too involving.  I had seen the trailer some time before and it seemed to be an 'American Pie' kind of movie.... <br /> <br />Well, i was wrong.  I sat in amazement the whole length of the movie, dumbfounded that it was so good.  SO GOOD!.  It takes alot of it's influence from another of my favorites, Risky Business.  It's not a remake and it's not a sequel.  it's more of an homage.  It's far better than if it were a remake.  It really is just a joy to watch.  I told my wife about it when she got back, and she kind of rolled her eyes and said 'yeah, okay, lets watch it'.  An hour and a half later of staring, jaw dropped, at the screen, she turned to me and said just one word: \\"GENIUS!\\" <br /> <br />Really, it's up there with Risky Business and Ferris Buellers Day Off.  It's a movie about growing up that we can all relate to.  This is the kind of movie that changes a persons perspective on life.  Amazing cast.  Amazing SoundTrack!  All over, great film!

B000M5AJQS|4.0|\\"The Departed\\" revisits the familiar cinematic world of cops and criminals, deception and violence, with a few new twists. In a star-filled cast, Leonardo DiCaprio shines as an undercover cop. Rather than play the typical cool customer of this genre, he portrays the sheer terror of a man playing a very dangerous game. Over time the lines in his face and tremors in his hands convey unbearable tension. His opposite number is Matt Damon, whose boyish good looks also show strain as he manages the investigation to find the traitor in the department. Nicholson is Nicholson; Martin Sheen wonderful; Mark Wahlberg is great as one of the more obnoxious cops to appear in film. Nice twists involving modern technology--text messages and cell phones. I'm not sure this film was the best of the year, but it was time for Scorcese. A little long, but highly enjoyable.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|If your asking is Global Warming really true, this is for you!  Very well done.
B0000399WI|5.0|As Tim Robbins' character writes in this movie \\"Hope is a good thing...\\", and this movie gives us hope that intelligent movies might still be made in Hollywood.
B000NDIAWY|3.0|Having loved Brandi Carlile's first CD, I had high hopes for her follow-up. Initially, however, I was disappointed at the definite move towards a Country music style in this album. It's a lot more 'twangy' than the rock and rawness of the first album. \\"The Story\\" has grown on me in subsequent listenings, but I think it's going to remain a firm second-best to her wonderful debut CD.
B0007OY2MG|5.0|Plenty of momentous developments in the lives of Lorelei and Rory Gilmore (Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel) occur in the third season of this excellent program that combines a family soap opera set in a town of eccentrics with the wise-cracking sensibility of a screwball comedy from the 40s.  Lorelei and Sookie (Melissa McCarthy) are forced to speed up their plans to open their own inn due to unforseen events at the Independence, though not without severe complications.  The most important arc of the season concerned Rory's senior year at Chilton and her choice of college.  The road to that decision is fraught with complications and wonderful character moments, and Rory's graduation is quite touching.  At first, I didn't care for the addition of Rory's new bad boy paramour Jess (Milo Ventimiglia), but he grew on me after a while.  Giving Luke (Scott Patterson) a strong male to butt heads with in his capacity as guardian further revealed his character's strength and decency, while his unfamiliarity with the role brought out a vulnerability.  Lorelei's parenting tips provided some of the best moments of the season.  Their enigmatic exchange in the final episode indicates that things may be heating up in their future.  Everything seems to be on track for an excellent fourth season.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|For those of us fascinated with the Crusades and the Holy Land this is a gift from Heaven (pardon the pun). Outstanding movie making and acting, this film should stand the test of time and rank with many of the all time greats including Ben Hur, The Ten Commandments, Lawrence of Arabia, etc. Altho a bit too realistic for some, the scenes give a hint of what that era's political struggles must have been like. If you wonder how the middle east situation came about, this movie will give you some background to build on. Treat yourself to a fascinating movie!
B000LC4CVA|5.0|This dvd is enchant, I loved watching it. The voices are so pure and heavenly, you must hear it to believe it. They are angels. Super quality and super sounded. If you have bought the first, then you must have this also.
B0006J28KU|5.0|Since its release I've seen it a 100 times - The way Pacino and Deniro are dressed is just extravagant! The Deniro's French Cut and the Hair style of Pacino, the Tatoo on Tom Sizemor's Arm and the makeup on Val's Eyes -whoo! its just GREAT. The two sides of the law - the rules to follow and the disciplines and loyalties of Partners and Families. It all comes together in each of Michael Mann's movies and HEAT was just the beginning. I recommend every one of his films to be bought and watched again and again.
B00003CWNR|5.0|After multiple viewings, I still adore the richness and humanity of this modest little story. The subject matter, the setting, the era, the details, the characters, they're all exquisitely rendered. Toby Maguire offers a supremely generous lead. He is a canvas, basically, upon which the other actors draw their characters. Michael Caine is particularly stunning, but the whole cast is in capital form. Kids have never looked better or more believable on film, ever. Lasse Hallestrom gets my vote as the reigning saint of intelligent film-making. Everything he does is ambitious and edifying and humanscale, and altogether marvelously uncommercial. He is everything that Hollywood should aspire to be, but does not.
0316018953|4.0|When you first see the book The Overlook in person you'll wonder if its worth the effort to read because of its fairly short size.  Never fear...Michael Connelly delivers on just about any angle you want to look at.  Though a quick read, you'll keep licking your fingers.<br /><br />The body of a physist is found on the overlook near Mulholland DRive.  Harry Bosch gets the case but before he can hardly begin he gets FBI interference on the basis of \\"national security.\\"  Fast paced with a somewhat shallow plot, The Overlook, will leave you wanting more.  Still a four star read.
B000EHRVP6|3.0|this moviez aiight. it haz alot of good gore. i thought it waz boring tho. probably one of tha most overrated movies of all time.
B000LC55F2|5.0|I'm writing two reviews at once, since I watched the movie and read the book.  I think it's fair to compare and contrast the two.<br /><br />They are both valuable and highly entertaining.  The movie has the benefit of adventure.  This is a murder mystery, flying toward an ultimate conclusion where Alfred Borden is going to be hanged for the murder of Robbie Angier, his rival.  Even though Borden and the viewer know that he didn't do it, the success of the movie is the intricacies of the adventure that brought them to this challenging and ultimate conclusion.<br /><br />They've lived lives of obsession, and this comes through well in the movie.  We see wives, lovers, friends, and coworkers distancing themselves from the protagonists as they become consumed by their magic, their careers and their rivalry.  That rivalry, coincidentally, started with a murder, albeit accidental and rushed to a murder of climax.  Like the book, the core of the story is the prestige - or the effect of the tricks that define their lives.  For Borden it's his Transported Man and for Angier, it's the apparent theft of that trick for the Improved Transported Man.  Although the tricks are similar in effect, they're execution is macabrely different, devastating both men with the price the illusion takes from their lives and from their soul.<br /><br />Where the book's strength is in character building, the movie is shorted in this regard, in favor of pacing and the rush to reveal the trick, I would have preferred a slower pace and more of the benefit of these amazingly obsessive and not very likable protagonists.  The book also uses some true magic realism in its effect because it takes the time to explain it.  The movie shorts the viewer in this manner by rushing the ending too soon.<br /><br />All that said, I prefer the movie to the book.  Enjoy both of them, however, they won't let you down.<br /><br /> - CV Rick
0439813786|5.0|First, I would like to say that I really enjoyed reading this book. It was one that I hoped would never end. It has been a long time since I read a book that was enriching and powerful. Yes, the story is about a young boy that has to go through various challenges to find out what his purpose is in this world. Hugo, a young master mind, has lost his uncle and not to long before that his father died. Now, Hugo is faced with having to maintain all the clocks in the train station which have to be oiled and checked regularly. He is also stealing parts from a grumpy old man's toy booth. He uses the parts to fix the clocks and to fix his mysterious device that he hopes will have a message from his dead father. But once he gets caught, he finds out the truth about this old man and why he so mean.
B000002G7G|4.0|I don't drool over the Velvet Underground and their important influences in rock like many people do, but not giving their few album releases a chance would be missing something big.  Well, somewhat big. <br /> <br />This album is a giant change compared to White Light/White Heat.  THAT was one insane listening experience.  This album however, is MUCH more laid back and easier for casual music fans to accept.  While I have to be in a certain mood to appreciate the quiet tone throughout the album, I can't ignore the fact that, when I AM in that mood, this is really good stuff. <br /> <br />Not the best album they ever did, but probably worth owning.
B000MGUZMU|5.0|When buying this CD, I had my expectations. However, this album is fantastic. As all Arcade Fire songs, it takes a couple of listens to really appreciate it and once you're hooked, there is no turning back. As a die-hard Arcade Fire fan of the EP and Funeral, I hoped Neon Bible lived up to the hype. The truth is that upon the first track (Black Mirror) you can immediately notice the extinsive layers that the band has put into the album. Win Butler, the lead singer is pitch perfect and his lyrics are absolutely beautifully written. The album, granted, does not as much of an \\"indie appeal\\" as Funeral being that it's not all over the place, but yet is a must have album for music lovers everywhere. I am fortunate enough to have seen this band a couple of times live and the live versions of neon bible are identical to the album and just as complex. The new version of No Cars Go is amazing and Keep the Car Running, Intervention, (Antichrist Television Blues), and Window Sill, are all huge additions to the album. You may not find as down-right \\"ball busting\\" songs as Wake Up or Power Out, but you will find the same passion and even more terrific melodies in this one.
B0009IOR6Q|3.0|Even though Cry Baby is an above-average comedy movie, the thing is, more often than not the storyline is more *silly* than it is actually funny.  Johnny Depp's character was pretty good, but he wasn't as much of a bad guy or rebel as you'd believe.  Just because he goes around driving a motorcycle and taking a few punches in the face doesn't mean he's a believable bad guy.  His character was lacking in that area, in my opinion. <br /> <br />I also felt that the grandmother of his girlfriend (the GOOD girl who sings happy 50's-style rock tunes, instead of the more loud and outrageous Elvis Presley-like rockers intended for the troublemakers) wasn't entirely in character for the majority of the film.  I mean, she tried so hard to flat out HATE teenagers who rebel against their parents to the point where she actually stood up to a crowd and mentions how she will not be brought down by them.  But then, a short time later when Depp showed up to her granddaughter's musical thing in a motorcycle, for some reason the grandmother forgot that she was supposed to strongly dislike teens who rebel and didn't mind at all that her granddaughter opted to drive away with Depp.  Strange. <br /> <br />The musical parts were okay, but most of them were 50's style rockers.  You know how the music sounds.  No need to elaborate on that. <br /> <br />A pretty decent movie with a few flaws in the way.  Pick up some of Depp's other superior movies, such as Charlie and the Chocolate Factory or Secret Window.
B000OCXMAE|1.0|..this cd. In all honesty, I don't actually OWN the album. I wanted to hear it on the net first to see if I liked it before I bought it. Boy, am I glad I did! This is definitely NOT the same Linkin Park that I was screaming along to back in my high school days. No way. I was extremely shocked to find out that they actually use the \\"f\\" word on here. This is the first and only Linkin Park disc to ever contain a parental advisory sticker. I have NO problem with curse words.     However, the thing that makes me extremely upset is that Linkin Park always bragged about being able to convey their anger without using harsh language, one of the many things that made them unique. Now, they throw around the \\"f\\" word all over the place. I guess that's their idea of \\"growing older\\". I dunno. In all fairness, this cd would be a decent effort from an up-and-coming band. But NOT from the likes of LP. No way.     Long gone are the days of the anger-driven LP. They have since transformed themselves into this detestable \\"soft rock\\" band. They sound exactly like U2 or Coldplay. [Nothing against those two bands, I just don't like soft rock.] I remember coming home from 10th and 11th grade, turning up LP super loud and letting out my aggression. Those days, sadly, are over.    Hybrid Theory and Meteora are still two of my all-time favorite bands. It's just that..LP are not exactly a favorite band of mine anymore. They've changed and not for the better. I supppose I give them credit for writing meaningful lyrics, but..we can turn on the tv and see Bush and the war if we want to be depressed. Music is my ESCAPE from reality. I'm sorry..but this cd is so politically driven...it's like turning on CNN.    I have to admit this cd is probably making someone a very nice coaster somewhere, so at least LP gets brownie points for producing a useful object. Other than that, stick to real rap-rock music.
B00065MDRW|3.0|King Crimson is a pretty interesting band for those who like unpredictable and diverse musical ideas.  That's what the band does best. <br /> <br />Even though I'm a fan of mellotrons and think they're the most beautiful thing put on record, I can't say this album excites me anymore.  It was good at first, when I didn't know a whole lot about the band, but once I received Lizard, Islands, Red and eventually learned to appreciate Larks Tongues in Aspic, I hadn't had much of an urge to go back to this album.   <br /> <br />It's still a pretty good listen, and for those who want their King Crimson to focus on vocal melodies, you can't go wrong with this album.  That's the albums strongest point.
B000006MV8|5.0|I was 10 years old when I bought this and it was the first new album that I had ever owned. I wanted it because of \\"Baby Blue\\" and \\"Day After Day\\" just like everyone else but I fell in love with the rest of the songs immediately. They are just as fresh today as they were the day I peeled the cellophane off of the album 35 years ago.<br /><br />Growing up a Beatles freak I was not disappointed because you can really hear that Beatles influence through out the album. \\"Sometimes\\" and \\"I'd Die Babe\\" have a great Rubber Soul sound to them and \\"Perfection\\" is just a great song. Hell, they are all very good!<br /><br />This is such a great mix of song writing and influances coming together to record a timeless album.<br /><br />Every time I see one of those top 100-album lists I cannot believe how after this one is over looked.<br /><br />A true classic and a must have for your collection.
B000002GXX|3.0|Starting with this album, this is where I felt the Eagles became more inconsistent.  It's also one of those albums where the better songs are the ones you probably aren't as familiar with, such as \\"Journey of the Sorcerer\\" and \\"Too Many Hands\\".  Those are probably my favorite two tracks.  I also like \\"Take It to the Limit\\" after all these years.   <br /> <br />I don't care for the title song at all, though.  The rest of the album is passable, but nothing to really wow me either.  Pick up the Eagles debut instead.
B000LE1GVW|5.0|I bought the album for These Streets and can't stop listening. His voice is incredible: raspy and soulful. All the songs are honest... Beautifully written lyrics, straight from the heart and without pretension. These streets, loving you, autumn are my favorites.
B0009F9O6W|5.0|While it may appear like this album features a lot of songs, there's actually only three of them (three HUGE multi-part pieces).   <br /> <br />I'd say Van Der Graaf Generator is a pretty tough band to get into (unlike Gentle Giant) because their musical ideas are pretty insanely OUT there, not to mention their lead singer is the definition of an acquired taste.  More often than not, the guy reminds me of Alice Cooper the way he tries to sound serious and believable, but instead ends up sounding goofy thanks to some of his rather odd vocal reaches.  Unlike Cooper though, he's actually singing most of the time instead of talk-singing (the main thing about Alice Cooper that drives me nuts). <br /> <br />But for every time the music rears in an insanely goofy direction, they are quickly taken back to a friendlier and more enjoyable melody.  This is basically an album for people who prefer vocal melodies in their progressive rock, instead of lengthy jams and multi-part instrumental pieces and what have you.   <br /> <br />Do I prefer vocal melodies over jams?  No, not really.  But I can't deny, with time and patience, you will find a highly enjoyable listening experience about lighthouses if you give Pawn Hearts an honest chance.
B000P2A256|5.0|I remember hearing Maroon 5 \\"Harder to Breathe\\" from an in store music video tape, and I completely fell in love. Now, 5 long years later finally a new album and I still LOVE them.
0767802659|5.0|This movie is just fun, almost funny at times.  Not to be taken seriously.
B000N3ST7A|5.0|I love Stevie, therefore this was the perfect long awaited  box set.. I've always loved the music because it's food for my soul but the dvd was wild to say the least because it got you that much closer to her as an artist.
B000P2A256|5.0|Every song on this cd is very listenable. Out of all 12 songs maybe 2 are just ok. I dont have there first cd but did enjoy all the singles that came off it. I downloaded this before i bought it to make sure i would like as i do with all cds anymore. Anyone looking for a cd that all songs are worth while this is the one :)
B000OCXMAE|2.0|A few decent tracks, but a vast departure from the Linkin Park of old.  Instead of taking the well mastered synthesized overtones from their prior albums which were everpresent throughout each song, they seem to utilize more naturally occuring sounds as the base of their music. <br /> <br />Which makes it just sound horrible.  For the most part, the album is soft.....too soft.  The lack of their mastered sound makes the music all but mainstream rock.  Then to mix in the politics..... <br /> <br />Like I said, a few decent tracks.  The album for some reason feels more like a \\"prequel\\" CD....something that should have come before Hybrid Theory.  Sadly, as with most third albums, groups tend to try new avenues which either do extremely well as the band has matured along with it's audience....or it flops.  I feel in this case, it is the latter.
B00003CXWV|5.0|this is def one of my favorite movies!! i love it. pure genius. great and captivating movie. i know it sounds cheesey. but this movie really is great. get it!!! i was really pleased w/ the fast delivery too. THIS IS A MUST SEE and theres no doubt about it that this will become one of your top favs as well.
0374105235|5.0|This is a great book to read if you want to find out what is going on in some other countries.  It's shocking to hear what is happening to the children over there. Hopefully awareness will help stop and prevent situations like these.
B000002VE7|4.0|Much has already been said about this album. More trivia first: When this     album first came out it was issued with a 3-d plastic case so the bull's     head on the cover looked 3-d. Anyways, this is probably the most    different sounding CD the band ever did. It's more guitar driven than     any of their previous albums and more so than the ones following. And     yet, the keyboards and synths here were also more riff driven and less     background than at any other time. Usually the keyboards and really every     other instrument have been solely in the background never overshadowing     the vocals, except for at the bridges, openings, and instrumentals. Not     here. The instrumental parts share at least equally with the vocals at     all times. Not an abundance of string pad sounds and piano. No orchestra.     This was definitely a product of its era. I don't understand why they     don't get these cd's remastered, i've been waiting for years and am     starting to lose interest in this old music. Hurry up arista!    Well it's now been over a year since all the remasters came out, I write this     part in 2011. The remaster of this is outstanding in 24 bit high definition     sound and includes a bunch of bonus tracks including demos. Get it!
1582701709|5.0|The law of attraction has been written about for thousands of years. It is too bad it is still a \\"secret\\". Rhonda Byrne does an excellent job of putting together people who explain how the law of attraction works and why.
B0000DZ3EN|3.0|When Return To Oz came out in 1985 I was excited as I am an Oz fan and enjoy the Oz books. I was wondering how they would combine the two Oz Books, Ozma of Oz and The Land of Oz and I have to say at the time I was pleased and saw the film several times. That was years ago and now I see the movie a bit more critically. Many who have read the books and seen the film say it is closer to Baum and yes in parts it is. I love every moment Dorothy is in Oz. Tik-tok, Jack Pumpkinhead, and Billina all come to life and are fun to see. Dorothy saves the day and manages to fight the Nome King by just being the strong little girl she is. If this film just took place in Oz it would be perfect, well almost perfect. To my mind the director made a mistake not having the scarecrow and Tin woodman through out the film. Few people knew about TikTok and Jack Pumpkinhead and just assumed they were rip offs of the Scarecrow and Tinwoodman. A continual presence in the film would have helped. Then there is the beginining of the film and it is a nightmare. Why would Aunt Em send Dorothy in for shock treatment? Did she really feel she was sick? To make a long story short they could have made a better introduction for a very good film which would have been much more appealing due to the changes. If this movie were a sandwich I would say the meat or center is good but the bread needs work. Still I enjoy it even today and feel it could have done better.
B0006N2EZ0|5.0|This was Whitney Houston's debut film and she did herself proud. And here's the thing about Kevin Costner--he plays his characters so naturally that you don't realize he's really a brilliant actor. He just seems like a normal guy on screen. Here, you just believe he is that troubled bodyguard. I loved this film. I saw it plenty at the theatre in 1992 and I've played it plenty on both VHS and DVD over the years. It's just a great chick flick--so many great scenes even in addition to the many vocal performances by Whitney. If you like a who-done-it film, amazing music, watching Kevin Costner, as well as just the right mix of romance and damsel in distress, you've got to get The Bodyguard (and get the sound track while you're at it).[[ASIN:B000002VMD The Bodyguard: Original Soundtrack Album]]
B000AL5OZA|1.0|This is not a good album. The choice of songs is simply bizarre and begs the question: if this is the short-list, how bad must the other offerings have been?! As has been commented elsewhere, Agnetha barely gets out of the lower registers, and therefore, gets little opportunity to showcase her great voice. Over-production only adds to the woes. There is no sparkle here, no soul and for the most part, this is not like any other Agnetha record. Easily the worst offering from any of the females post-Abba. Avoid.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|My first encounter with this series was the movie.  I went to see it at the theater not knowing that it had been a TV series.  I enjoyed the movie.  I remember saying that it would have made a better Miniseries movie than a theater release. Heh...little did I know... :)  My father-in-law bought this complete series and let us borrow it.  Wow!! What a fantastic show.  It's too bad that Fox didn't do it justice; showing it out of order and whatnot.   I'm not a Whedon fan, never did like Buffy, but he managed to capture something else here.  This show is such an adventure with interesting characters and plot development. I've watched this series over and over and over without getting bored of it.  My only gripe with Firefly is the theme song. It is so freakin' annoying.  Makes my skin crawl just thinking about it. I just skip past it.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|A super adventure that allows us to completely explore the planet that we all call home - EARTH!  A well constructed series that covers all aspects so thoroughly.  The photography is stunning.  A wonderful tribute to PLANET EARTH!
B000MTPANQ|5.0|If you are a real Niel Young fan then this is for you.This what i like to remember, Niel at his finest, singing with the passion only a real fan of his can feel.
0446677450|5.0|I really enjoyed this book for the \\"think out of the box\\" financial information.  I wish that I had read it years before!  A must read for parents and their teenagers.
B000HC2PCM|5.0|If you were going to buy a best of to introduce someone to Merle Haggard, this is a good one. Plenty of classics here, But I kind of wish they included more of his MCA and Epic era hits.
B000002KE2|4.0|Given the excellence of their first three albums, Vol. 4 was generally considered a small step backward for Black Sabbath, but it delivers nonetheless.  With the exception of Changes, which can be called nothing if not trite, and FX (a short work of noise, strictly for stoners), the album is classic Sabbath.  The rest of it more than makes up for these two indulgences.  Indeed, heavy and hard driving tracks are the rule with everyone in fine form and obviously fired up (drug reference not necessarily intended).  Laguna Sunrise offers a break from the assault, but fits uneasily between the walls of metal before and after.  That said, it is also Tony Iommi's finest instrumental moment.  Despite its contrast with the rest of the album, it's still a very beautiful piece and the album would be something less without it.  All in all, an excellent Sabbath album and another defining monument to metal.
B000F7OMZ2|4.0|First off, there are things about this film I really love. The play between Harrison Ford and Ke Huy Quan is great, (a pity it wasn't utilized a bit further but that's the price you pay for action at every turn) as are the scenes with Kate Capshaw's Willie Scott. She provides Indy with the perfect antithesis to his stoic, cool behaviour. The spike chamber is a brilliant setpiece and something that everyone will remember once having watched it.     It's in the second half that things go a bit wrong. When Lucas described Temple Of Doom as the dark sequel to Raiders (a la Empire Strikes Back) it confused me slightly. The underlying storyline is indeed darker, as it depicts Kali worshipping, human sacrifice and children being on the receiving end of some nasty violence. However, the overriding tone of the film is more frivolous than any other Indy flick. This comes from small, incidental snippets of comedy that appear in inappropriate places and points where it just turns outright silly. Examples of which would be the gross-out comedy from the palace meal; Shortround beating up fully-grown men, etc. All this stuff would be great in a film aimed solely at kids but then this isn't. It seems that Lucas and Spielberg were trying to alleviate the darker passages of the film but instead went too far in the other direction at some points. This leaves you with a strange concoction that doesn't actually know what it wants to be. It's a bit too silly for adults and too scary for children. It is a heck of alot of fun when it does work, however.     I would argue that Raiders is in fact the darkest in the series. Whilst it has that overriding sense of fun and a good portion of humour, the violence is played much straighter and the ominous, mysterious danger of the ark permeates the film (helped no end by Williams' great score).
B000002KDO|5.0|If anyone was under the illusion that Black Sabbath could get no blacker than they did on Paranoid, a shivery album with titles like War Pigs, Electric Funeral, and Hand of Doom... well, Master of Reality quickly dispatched such a notion.  Songs like Children of the Grave and Lord of This World live up to their names both lyrically and musically.  Except for Solitude, a very mellow but no less depressing interlude, and Tony Iommi's inclusion of two go-nowhere-but-thankfully-short instrumentals, Master of Reality is the near perfect storm of metal with all the thunder and lightning you can take.  Beginning with Sweet Leaf, an insidiously memorable tribute to Ozzy's love affair with the unholy weed, and ending with Into the Void, an indictment of everything wrong with the world (but which includes a hopeful, if somewhat improbable escape plan), it's all a metalhead could want.  If not Sabbath's finest hour (I would bestow that honor on Sabbath Bloody Sabbath), it's definitely a close second.
B00005JPKE|4.0|To be honest, I was enthused to see Letters but not completely excited. I thought its companion Flags of Our Fathers was a dramatically empty war film that seemed manipulative as it was banal. Everyone was saying how great Letters From Iwo Jima was and while I knew it had to be better than Flags, I was curious as to the extent on how better it was. I sometimes find Clint Eastwood films (aside from Unforgiven) to be a little too emotionally distant and a bit too calculated. While a couple of points knock Letters down from being a classic war film, it's still better than anything since Saving Private Ryan. <br /> <br />Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai, Batman Begins) plays Koribayashi, a General stationed on island Iwo Jima during World War II. American forces are quickly approaching the island in hopes of taking it over and it doesn't help that the Japanese forces on the island are quite outnumbered and lack of support from the mainland makes things worse. Saigo is a young soldier who's not as battle-hardened and like many of the soldiers, he wants to get back to his wife and baby. But when 2 governments say war must go on, how do you end up stopping something you don't even want to be in in the first place? <br /> <br />I have to get the negative out of the way. The film has a slight sluggish pace to it. Even though we get scenes of character development as well as war scenes, the whole vibe feels a little bit more serious and maybe not as accessible. Ever watch a movie that just feels long? That's kind of what this felt like. Even though longer movies like Saving Private Ryan or Apocalypse Now were lengthy, they never once felt their length whereas this film you get the feeling the world slowed down a tad. Granted, it is a war film and it's not meant to be some popcorn fun, when you consider films about war being better paced, you kind of notice it here. <br /> <br />One problem I always have with Paul Haggis scripts (Million Dollar Baby, Flags and notably Crash) isjust how fleshed out the characters feel. His and other scripts by other writers have what I call \\"plot puppets\\": characters that don't really live and breathe that we care for but rather just tools to say dialogue and deliver dramatic scenes without the emotional backing to support it. Letters corrects that very problem Flags suffered from and we feel a lot more for these soldiers this time. Maybe it was that film's more recognizable cast or maybe here they just feel more complex than the other film. <br /> <br />Even though it's about an entirely different conflict, it's hard not to compare Letters to Spielberg's Private Ryan, what with the color desaturation but you can make a case that this is probably one of the better crafted war films lately. <br />
B0009IOR6Q|4.0|Cry-Baby is a hilarious, campy musical that pokes fun at some classic musicals. The movie takes place in Baltimore and is named after its main character Wade Walker (Johnny Depp) who is nicknamed Cry-Baby because of the single tear he's able to shed at will. This unique ability and his devilish good looks drive the ladies wild. He even has Cry-Baby tattooed on his arm under Depp's real Cherokee chief head tattoo and scripted across the back of his leather jacket.<br /><br />Cry-Baby is a drape, a leather wearing, motor cycling bad boy who hangs with a bunch of other drapes made of up of his pregnant sister Pepper (Ricki Lake), Hatchet-Face girl (Kim McGuire), Wanda Woodward (Traci Lords), and Milton Hackett (Darren E. Burrows); all delinquents in their own right.<br /><br />One day one of the \\"square\\" girls takes notice of Cry-Baby. Allison (Amy Locane) decides she doesn't want to be so good anymore and encourages Cry-Baby's advances. Cry-Baby crashes a square party and takes Allison for a ride on his bike back to the drapes hang-out where his troupe gives her a makeover reminiscent of Sandy in Grease. They sing a duet together and there's a memorable make out scene with everyone wet French-kissing. Cry-Baby teaches Allison the basics of how to French Kiss (\\"Kiss Me, kiss me hard\\") which was both sexy and pee your pants funny. Everyone is interrupted when Allison's jilted boyfriend and his gaggle of goons pay a visit and set Cry-Baby's motorcycle on fire. A fight breaks out, the police show up and Cry-Baby is arrested and sent to a detention center until he's 21. There are some songbirds singing in jail reminiscent of Elvis Presley's Jailhouse Rock but perhaps less choreographed. But bars, conniving girls and angry mothers can't separate Cry-Baby from his true love for long.<br /><br />Acting wise it is really hard to judge. Everyone was over acting to make a point and these roles are really tongue-in-cheek. As far as I'm concerned this film proves Johnny Depp can do just about anything and still be sexy. Johnny already had a huge following with his success in 21 Jump Street. As for fat girl, Ricki Lake, this came after Babycakes and Hairspray which I think were better roles for her. It looks like she's sporting a pregnant breasts and tummy body suit for her role. I didn't notice any fat stereotypes. She already has two illegitimate kids and gets just as much make-out time as any of the other characters. Even the somewhat deformed Hatchet Face girl gets a lot of action. Special appearances by Willem Dafoe (Batman) as a mean guard and rock star Iggy Pop as Uncle Belvedere round off the cast.<br /><br />Cry-Baby was written and directed by John Walters who is also the writer and director of the Hairspray musical. You really have to have an open mind for comedy to enjoy this film. I thought it was hilarious, going in with the perspective of not taking it seriously. There are a lot of great one-liners. Would it be on my favorite movie list? Probably not, but I'd watch it again and recommend seeing it at least once. Reviewed by M.E. Wood.epp can do just about anything and still be sexy.

My finace has a phd in neurological psych. and has revealed to me how Gladwell misuses some contemporary psychological theory to prove his \\"real-life\\" illustrations.

B000FMGTTE|4.0|With the return of the Man of Steel to film screens after almost twenty years also came the return of the classic John Williams' themes that made up the musical side of the franchise. Composer John Ottman had some big shoes to fill with this score. I mean, it isn't easy bringing one of the best known film scores of all time into a new era. But Ottman proves himself with this score that not only pays homage to Williams but also adds on to those classic themes.<br /><br />The score starts with a triumphant return of the Superman theme. The Williams' theme is given a super-charged feel that returns it to all of its past glory. Here is an inkling of what the score sets out to do with the themes from the original films. The Superman theme also appears here and there throughout the score, especially during a rousing moment during the space shuttle sequence (Rough Flight).<br /><br />The classic love theme from the films is also present and it is here that Ottman really has his best luck with the Williams themes. The theme is much more subdued and even mature, as if to signify the relationship between Superman and Lois in this film. The theme makes appearances during the flying sequence (How Could You Leave Us?) and returns full force in the film's final scene (Reprise / Fly Away).<br /><br />Another Williams' theme is the Krypton / Fortress of Solitude theme. In fact it is the first piece of music we hear since it appears at the start of the film (but isn't on the soundtrack release). The theme also returns briefly when Lex arrives at the Fortress (Tell Me Everything). There is also the brief appearance of the farm theme as well (Memories). Each of these pieces serves to tie together the franchise of old with the franchise of new.<br /><br />Ottman's new pieces are the majority of the music and he fills into some big shoes. His rousing action themes (Bank Job, Saving The World) are terrific pieces of action score that, while they don't rival the Williams themes, serve as new additions to the franchise's musical history. Ottman also gives Lex Luthor a new theme as well (replacing the comical theme by Williams) that serves to give the character the menace that actor Kevin Spacey brings to the role.<br /><br />But the true highlight of Ottman's original pieces is his more emotional pieces. The amazing music for Superman's flying into space after overhearing Lois (You're Not One Of Them) is the perfect example of Ottman's capabilities as a film composer to bring life and emotion to a scene. This theme also makes appearances in other areas of the score especially in the final scene leading to the finale (Reprise / Fly Away)  and it is why Ottman is the perfect choice to bring the musical side of Superman back to life.<br /><br />While the score is not the classic that Superman The Movie was, this score proves that one can mix new with old and get amazing results. Ottman might not be John Williams, but he proves he can fill those shoes and expectations. Superman Returns brings a classic character and a classic score into the 21st Century and lets hope their here to stay.es, serve as new additions to the franchise's musical history.

It has the \\"starter\\" stuff and a great challenge at that! It also has the RKC stuff towards the last 1/3 or the book. Pavel has trained quite a bit of people including a teacher of mine of the martial arts. It's a good book and will definitely challenge whoever picks it up. Now. . .how far can you go in de-whimpefying  yourself...that's up to you.

B000GCG59W|5.0|Su voz desgarrada, intensa y dúctil, y la impecable musicalización que la acompañan, han convertido a Concha Buika en una de las más grandes revelaciones del llamado \\"afro flamenco\\". El segundo disco de esta cantaora originaria de Palma de Mallorca, viene cargado con duende y sabor. Con canciones propias -sobresalen \\"Mi Niña Lola\\" y \\"A mi manera\\"-, y otras clásicas -las inolvidables \\"Ojos Verdes\\" y \\"Nostalgias-, esta producción es insuperable. No en vano está de por medio la firma de un afamado y acertadísimo productor musical español: Javier Limón. Un disco total y maravilloso que no me canso de oír desde hace más de un año. Absolutamente recomendable.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|I was a bit shocked to see some things different in the way Linkin Park had done based on their past albums, but it was a nice surprise for me.  I kept an open mind despite some negative reviews and found myself listening to the whole album, loving most of it.  I definately give them props for triyng something new despite how older fans might feel about it.  I thought they still kept their edge, not on the whole album, but a good bit of the songs.  I loved Shadow of the Day, and Hands held, one of their most different songs they have done but I personaly loved them.
B000JSI7AI|5.0|Every time I watch this film it breaks my heart.  It is one of the most moving I have ever see.  Of course Heath Ledger is great and deserved the Oscar for his work but again, each time I see him I think that Jake Gyllenhall could have been nominated for best actor also.  He is really good.  Wonderful work by two young actors.  The whole movie defines what it means to make a picture.
B00005K9LM|3.0|The love most people are showing for this album is probably a result of when  they were introduced to Judas Priest. Screaming For Vengeance was a big album for them and a lot of new fans came on board. However, as a fan from about the time of Hell Bent For Leather I found it somewhat of a let-down. I appreciate that rather then sell out after Screaming they decided to continue to rock out. The sell out, of course was Turbo. <br /> <br /> There are only two great songs here. Freewheel Burning and Love Bites. Most are down a notch from the earlier songs they try to recreate, like Jawbreaker and the silly Heavy Duty/Defenders of The Faith. The Sentinel is okay, but over-rated and I like Eat Me Alive and Some Heads Are Gonna Roll to a certain degree. <br /> <br />Also, the production is too wet. There is a pervasive wall of reverb that makes the over-all sound somewhat indistinct rather than crystal clear and focused. This production really hinders Night Comes Down and Rock Hard, Ride Free which have the potential to be good songs. <br /> <br />As I said (and you can probably tell by this review), I was a little let down by this album. They were losing the edge somewhat and it was obvious the ground-breaking days of British Steel were in the past. If anyone is new to Priest and is looking for their strongest work, that's the place to start. Also, the new Essential Judas Priest is a pretty good over-view. <br />
B000F1IQN2|5.0|Munich is a rather interesting film based on the book \\"Vengeance: The True Story of an Israeli Counter-Terrorist Team,\\" which was written by George Jonas. The author is a Hungarian born, Canadian writer. <br /> <br />Out of 14 books he has written, Vengeance is the story of an Israeli operation to assassinate the terrorists responsible for the massacre that took place during the 1972 Olympic games. <br /> <br />Steven Spielberg directs the film and the DVD provides a rare interview in which Mr. Spielberg discusses that his movie is not anti-Israel and or pro-Palestinian. This got me curious... and as I researched the background, the interview is intended to dispel the protests of the author, who complained that Munich was a distorted interpretation of his original work. <br /> <br />In essence, Jonas said that scriptwriter Tony Kushner, a Jew who has referred to the formation of Israel as a mistake, failed to make a moral distinction between terrorism and legitimate military action. <br /> <br />Critics of the book said that Jonas's source for the book; New York security consultant Jubal Aviv had fabricated the story. Reading all these details got us rather curious about the film, which we obtained and finally watched. <br /> <br />The production is a thrilling recount of details that were unknown to us. The revenge plot puts forward the fact that when we set out to pay back for sins of the past, innocent people sometimes pay the price. The movie therefore, delves into complex issues of guilt, violence, murder, love, family... honor, and the defense of the right of the people of Israel to have a place they can call home. <br /> <br />The reliving of the events that lead and transpired during the kidnapping and murder of the athletes is... horrifying to say the least. Golda Meir is represented in this movie and she has a monologue where she weighs the actions and consequences of what they are about to do that is simply priceless soul-searching view of what any leadermust go through as they guide a people or a nation towards survival. <br /> <br />The technology used to eliminate those responsible is interesting, the methods are at times careless and dangerous, the people that reveal the whereabouts of those to be killed are interesting, but mercenary and it is with great horror that we realize they provide information to both sides... at a high price, of course, gaining great wealth from all the violence that ensues. <br /> <br />From beginning to end, we found ourselves riveted on the screen, learning a lot and feeling that hindsight provides 20-20 vision on rather complex issues that while we are living them... leaves us all blind due to lack of total awareness of the powers at play. Don't miss it!
B00005K9LN|5.0|This is one of the best albums of all time. It has all the elements of what heavy metal was at the time and would become. It caught perfectly the slice in time when heavy metal was just starting to get noticed, but had not yet gone mainstream.  <br /> <br />The main strength of this album is the songwriting. Every song was EXCELLENT and performed stellarly. The songs that meant to be commercial were catchy and the songs that were meant to be aggressive and heavy were just that. But they were all good. Not a clunker to be found. The songs achieved a great balance and were all pretty much different than the one before it. And while the musicianship wasn't complex, the solos were great and every performance was spot-on: not sloppy or lacking and yet, not over-indulgent. <br /> <br /> Breaking The Law and Living After Midnight need no introduction. Rapid Fire/Metal Gods are both heavy and Metal Gods gets a chance to air out and ride a great riff for a while at the end. Grinder is a song with a great riff and silly lyrics. United is a true anthem with the heavy verses and sing along chorus. You Don't Have To Be Old To Be Wise is pretty good and The Rage is killer with a great intro. This song seems to be the blueprint  for much of Point Of Entry, but is much better here. My personal favorite is Steeler which starts fast and heavy and rides that riff to the end adding layers of guitars. <br /> <br />A lot of metal purists who were either original fans of the group or who came to Priest from later generations of metal call this album a sell out. I have to agree to a certain extent. But I make two points in their defense. 1. At least they didn't eliminate the heavy ones altogether like they would with Point Of Entry and, yuck, Turbo. Steeler and Rapid Fire are still as heavy as anything released up to that time. 2. Selling out  was nothing new for them by this time. Diamonds and Rust and Better By You were flagrant attempts to have a hit single. And don't forget Evening Star. Living After Midnight and Breaking The Law did become big songs and did lead to the rise of hair metal posers, but remember, these songs were original at the time and not copying the formula that many lesser groups did soon after. <br /> <br />All in all, this album is a classic and should be owned by anyone who has any interest in heavy metal at all. PS The bonus tracks are there but not necessary to justify purchasing this cd.
1582701709|1.0|I agree with some of the ideas in this book, but not in the matter-of-fact manner it is expressed.  If you have never read a book about positive thinking and attracting prosperity, this book might just change your life.  Which is a wondeful thing if it does.  But, if you have read books on this topic, don't waste your time or money on this book, just browse through it while at the book store or something, if you're that curious.  Or find another book on this topic, there are several out there that delve deeper with more profound explanations. This book definately recycles information that has been around in several books for several years and makes the idea seem like some extraordinary secret that has never been unlocked or exposed.  Just not true.  And life is not always so simple and this book might mislead people into not accepting and loving their lives the way it is at any given moment, for the good and the bad.  To really lean into life is living abundantly, not trying so hard to make a million bucks, finding \\"the one\\" or having the perfect life.  Life is much more intricate than that.  There are more pieces to the puzzle but, thinking positively does do more good than bad.
0465011047|5.0|I read Mr. Chol-Hwan's story late last year. Recently, I was discussing NK with someone and I recommended this book. President Bush has been pilloried by many on the left for his labeling of this evil regime as part of the \\"Axis of Evil\\"---and trust me, when you read Mr. Chol-Hwan's account, you will agree. What I find most curious about those who criticized the president, is their almost universal regard for similar dictatorships in Cuba and Venezuela---dictators cut from the same Leninist-Stalinist cloth.  <br />Mr. Chol-Hwan's suffering, and the suffering of his family should not be ignored, nor should his steadfast determination to desire and ultimately achieve freedom.  <br />A little reality goes a long way---there is evil in this world, much as the left would have us believe otherwise---and Mr. Chol-Hwan's account serves to place an exclamation point on the notion. A must read, highly recommended.
B00005JPCF|5.0|A WONDERFUL animated film, Happy Feet, brings to the screen the story of a young penguin with a terrible singing voice, but a wonderful talent for dancing.  In the Antarctic Emperor Penguin community, however, his dancing abilities are rather unappreciated.  His initial disappointment will soon turn to excitement when events make him discover a world he had no idea existed and his skills are put to good use...  Elijah Wood, Hugh Jackman, Nicole Kidman, Robin Williams, and the rest of this AMAZING cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the animation does come ALIVE)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs not to mention a few tears.    The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor, and the MUSIC are all EXCELLENT!  In short, Happy Feet is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!  Strongly recommended along with the Shrek and Ice Age movies, Antz, The Ant Bully, Cars, Flushed Away, Hoodwinked, Madagascar, Monsters Inc. and Over the Hedge.  4.5 Stars  PS If you are going to be using the Greek subtitles, simply...do not!  The translation is horrid with profanity that only an amateur (and with serious mental disabilities at that) would think of including in a primarily children's film.

B000OCXFCO|5.0|Okay, I was very hesitant about buying this album.  \\"The System has Failed\\" got decent reviews, and when I purchased it, I absolutely hated it.  I never really thought Megadeth had an album with great songs from beginning to end anyway, so why should this one be any different?  Also the fact that it was another concept about the war in Iraq that so many bands feel they need to chime in on these days did not appeal to me.  WELL.. first off, musically this album is AMAZING.  Daves vocals are superb, and the guitars by new guitarist Glen Drover are as good as Marty Friedman....if not better. (Which is dificult for me to say as Marty is an all-time great in my opinion.)Dave and Glen trade blazing solos and the sound and speed on this record is just total destruction!  Mustaine has managed to take everything that has made Megadeth great over the years and incorporated them into these songs.  Sometimes you will think certain parts sound like they could have been on Peace Sells, R.I.P. or even Cryptic Writings.  It is very fresh, well mixed and everything a die hard Megadeth fan has been waiting for.  I hate to see bands go on with all new lineups (a la Guns N Roses), BUT in this case, it has breathed new life into this band.  Songs 1-6 are all amazing. 10.0 on the richter scale.  After that, the album slows a bit. Songs 7,9, and 11 are filler, but still very listenable.  The re-make of A Tout-Le Monde is better than the original. Song 10 \\"You're Dead\\" towards the end of the record heats it back up, so there are 8 songs on here that make this record money very well spent.
B000O178BY|2.0|Okay, I am a HUGE NIN fan, and at first, I thought this album was terrific. I fell too much into its creativity, and I was just exciterd that it was new NIN. But after re-listening to Broken and The Fragile, I thought \\"this is not good, Trent.\\" Compared to all the earlier works (exluding With Teeth) this is very sub-par and lazy. All of Trent's best albums were filled with aggression and excitement. This is just electronic noise. And I am not one of those people that listens to NIN just for the heaviness. I love EVERY NIN song (with the exception of some With Teeth songs). Every songs on this new album starts the same way: a strange, fake drum sound that sets the rhythm of the song. There is almost no guitar used in this album, and the little that is used is covered with annoying, staticy distortion. Now, I will say the whole concept and story is very cool. I love the way Trent's really thinking about important events and problems in America. I have also seen all the websites he created to support the album, and those are interesting as well. But the awful music is not enough to camoflauge the brilliance of the concept. Mr. Reznor, if you ever read this (doubtfully), please go back to your early song writing, with the industrial, heavy, brutal, beautiful sound that I fell in love with.
B0009RP3ME|5.0|It is outrageously priced, and not as different as one would expect (atleast I thought it would have more), but it's not a total waste as it is different in a few ways.<br /><br />First, it's in a Jewel Case so that does make the artwork/packaging kinda cool.<br /><br />Second, the extra tracks are awesome. I love Home. Very good song, sad that it was left off. The THTF remix is a very good remix. Probably my favorite as it has the heaviest reworking, I think. The RWIBv2 is absolutely amazing. The album version is more powerful, but this is still a beautiful song. Kind of felt like a Still version.<br /><br />The extra DVD is the same exact disc that came with the DualDisc in America, so that was kind of a let down, as I was expecting concert footage from the Japan tour, but seeing as how it doesn't say that anywhere, that was my bad.<br /><br />Overall, awesome cd, but probably a die-hard fan purchase with it being so expensive.

B000P2A256|5.0|I may be in the 1% minority on this, but I think this album is better than \\"Songs about Jane.\\" Maroon 5 to me has always been more of a Pop/Rock band than anything else. \\"It Won't Be Soon Before Long\\" is more like funky Pop/Rock. \\"Songs about Jane\\" wasn't an R&B album, so the new one isn't a huge departure from the latter. There's a greater Pop sensibility about this one, but it's not a bad thing. It seems like the same band to me. Overall, the sound is very recognizable. The album is very breezy as far as repeat plays. It's rather easy to get through.     I think the big difference is that the band sounds more polished on this record. Which I think naturally happens if you're really getting better and improving as artists. I never would have expected the same raw sound that was displayed on \\"Songs about Jane\\" four years later. The texture of the album is much slicker than the previous, but give credit where it's do. I think as both recording technology and mastering techniques improve, it's going to be more challenging to get a leaner and more simplistic sound. \\"It Won't Be Soon Before Long\\" definitely sounds more dynamic and bigger. Unless you're intentional stripping down the sound of the record, I wouldn't expect it.     This album is probably the best compromise between \\"Songs About Jane\\" and some of the more current trends. It's got more energy than the previous. I actually prefer songs like \\"If I Never See Your Face Again,\\" \\"Makes Me Wonder,\\" \\"Little of Your Time,\\" \\"Wake Up call,\\" \\"Can't Stop,\\" and \\"Kiwi\\" to their more up-tempo counterparts on \\"Songs About Jane.\\" The ballads from the previous record might be better, but I think they dragged the pacing of the album down more. I would have exchanged \\"Figured It Out\\" and \\"Infatuation\\" (pre-order bonus tracks from iTunes) for \\"Goodnight, Goodnight\\" and \\"Not Falling Apart\\" or made them #13 and #14. But overall, that's a small complaint.     I'm sure a lot of people were probably skeptical as to whether they couldcomeback after so long and being so relatively new. But in the end, I think they accomplished exactly what they set out to do...make a great follow-up. I just hope we don't have to wait four years for the next album.
B000OCXMAE|1.0|Not much to say.  Change is good but this is not.  This is basically a whole new band that I'm NOT interested in and I've followed them from the beginning.  Oh well.
B000P2A256|3.0|I'm really disappointed with this album.  I absolutely LOVED Songs About Jane.  I loved EVERY song on that cd (and that is the first cd I've ever owned that that has happened!), and this one, I like maybe two songs.  It does not compare to Songs About Jane at all, whatsoever.  This album is just not what I expected from Maroon 5 at all.

B000NA28I4|4.0|After hearing all of the negative publicity from fans, I almost didn't watch this movie.  But then, having not read the books to let me know what there was to dislike, I found it an enjoyable little fantasy about a boy and his dragon.  Not as profound or beautiful as Lord of the Rings, by any means, but still entertaining as it stands.  And it was nice that for once the dragon doesn't die at the end.
B000MNP2KI|4.0|I heard a lot of good things about this movie.  Many said it was the best yet.  I think it comes close, but not quite.  It starts off on fire, very fast, lots of action.  Then it hit these lulls through out where it drags on a little.  Some of it was believable, some totally unbelievable.  It was probably about 20 minutes too long, but the story held with some interesting twists.  Definitely worth getting. <br />
B00005JPCF|5.0|First of all who is everyone kidding reviewing this movie to something more than it is.  Plain and simple this is a child movie, so it is meant to be fun and enthusiastic for a child and for some adults who take in the oldies and musical genre.  My daughter is 18 months old and she completely loves this movie.  Everytime I play the movie she starts dancing around, it motivates her musically.  This is the greatest movie that i have seen this year that captures the audience in which it was written for.  Of course for an adult after watching it 1 or 2 times we say enough but for a child they continue to explore something new in the movie every single time they watch it.  This movie is a great movie for all children to see. Its fun for all the family.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|BBC has done it again. Planet Earth is an excellent follow up to that other landmark series \\"The Living Planet\\". The use of high definition takes Planet Earth to completely new levels as far as nature documentaries go.

6304779356|5.0|If this movie could be rated Higher I would.  Its just that great era where movies were just good, I love this movie a whole lot, I believe this movie got me into the whole genre of Vampire Loving.  And of course the actors in this movie for a child growing up in that era were also hot.  The soundtrack to this movie is off the hook and its a great summer time CD.  I highly recommend this movie.  It truly is the best movie ever of its time.

In the endless debate of Roger Waters vs. David Gilmour my vote is always 110% in favor of David Gilmour.  From the front cover it was obvious that it would be scaled down a bit but I didn't expect it to be as scaled down as it is.  David talks to the audience a little here and there which is nice.  The bad part about it, however, is that he speaks so softly that you can't hear anything he says without turning up the volume quite a bit.  I would guess that the music is played at twice the volume as his voice when he speaks to the audience.<br /><br />The intro sets the stage for what is to come: a very, very slow version of \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamonds\\" which is played again later in the set at more of a pace that Pink Floyd fans are used to.  There are a couple times during the set when David plugs in the electric guitar for a guitar solo but throughout the set I found myself wanting to turn it off in favor of watching the \\"Pulse\\" dvd instead.<br /><br />Overall I was very disappointed and if it were easier and possible I would return it for something else.  I watched about half of the concert before falling asleep a couple nights ago and sadly have very little interest in even finishing it.  It pains me to rate anything by David Gilmour or Pink Floyd so low but for the benefit of others I rated it how I honestly feel.
B000002JSN|4.0|the beatles had their white album, the clash sandinista, the stones exile on main street. for me, this is zep's addition to that list of looser, longer, experimental, eclectic albums. <br /> <br />those who prefer the ultra-tight & efficient blues metal attack of other zep albums, this will be interesting but not a favorite. As with the other albums i mentioned above, i found myself hitting the skip button throughout. of course, there are still classics -- kashmir, trampled underfoot, ten years gone etc <br /> <br />but my experience with these albums is they take time & patience to appreciate. for instance, exile is now my favorite stones album. ditto for sandinista although at first i didn't like it so much. <br /> <br />so i will give this album time to sink in and suggest others do same.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|I was never a fan of the Brosnan films. When I look back over the decades I am afraid I can really only find four or five great Bond films and now Casino Royale is one of them. Since watching this I have become a huge fan of Eva Green. She captured my heart as Vesper Lynd. I suppose it is something highly subjective but she made me feel sorry for Vesper not hate her as a traitor. Daniel Craig is the best Bond since Sean Connery was starting out. This is the Bond film the way it should have been with a more realistic and credible story and no ridiculous gadgets or super villains.
B000P2A256|3.0|I just bought this CD yesterday and have listened to it about 3 or 4 times already. I am a HUGE Maroon 5 fan, and must say that I was a bit disappointed in their sophomore release. It was not as funky and soulful as the their debut album,or as this album's lead single, \\"Makes Me Wonder\\" but the CD is still catchy and has some good cuts.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|I'd heard that the new LP CD was going to be a departure from their previous work and I was a little worried that I'd hear a catastrophe of St. Anger proportions, but that didn't happen. This CD is absolutely fantastic. It still retains some of their unique hard-core rap/rock mixture and introduces some new music that I think is just phenomenal.    \\"Hands Held High\\" is mesmerizing and it's a little like getting kicked in the stomach because the words are so powerful.     \\"Bleed It Out\\" just completely rocks. I can't wait to add this song to my playlist and run to it.    Every song on this CD is great. It's the best new album I've heard all year.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|i think that this has to be the best James Bond movie yet!!! this movie was Awesome!!! my favorite James Bond Movie!
B000P2A256|5.0|This album may not have a song that will reach the heights of \\"This Love\\" but on whole I think it is a better album than Songs About Jane. They found their sweet spot with this album and I highly recommend it.<br /><br />You can feel much of the groove of the great 80's and the 70's in this album. At a time when a great deal of boring second rate crap is being released this shines.
B000P2A256|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised to hear another Maroon 5 cd was coming out soon. It's not Songs about Jane but it's still awesome. It's rockier and edgier. You can definitely hear the Police and other influences in the sound and I love that. Adam's lyrics are as complex and beautiful as ever. He's a little more direct with his songwriting here as opposed to Songs about Jane. The cd takes a few listens for it to grow on you. The first listen I took my headphones off and said what is this? But after 3 or 4 listens I can't put it down. Great job Maroon 5. I look forward to seeing you on the road. Keep making great music!
0743277708|5.0|Great literature is one that inspires the imagination. This book does that by taking a world we think we are familiar with and turning it into an adventure in which you end up relating to the characters in a way not thought possible. This is a fantastic book and, I feel, a classic.

B000K15VSA|5.0|All the press about this DVD release is that it's going to include four different versions of the film: the original 1982 U.S. theater release, the original international release (which contained a little more violence, basically; it's been available on VHS before), the 1992 director's cut, and then the new \\"definitive\\" Ridley Scott cut with updated special effects and everything supposedly just the way Scott wants it. <br /> <br />I'm starting to get concerned about the release though.  The original press releases about this DVD said that the director's cut would get a limited reissue in late 2006 (which did happen), then the new definitive cut would get a brief theatrical release this year before hitting DVD soon after.  That was all said last year.  I haven't seen a thing about a theatrical release or a DVD release for this year.  Anyone heard anything new? <br /> <br />For the record, I'm a fan of all the versions and flipped over the 1982 theatrical release, but I prefer the director's cut.  I much prefer the ambiguous ending, and the unicorn scene making you wonder about Deckard's character.  After seeing the director's cut, I felt that the original narration, in particular over Batty's death scene, made me feel like the studio believed I wouldn't understand the movie otherwise.  Give me some credit, studio! <br /> <br />And the original's ending always did feel like a cop-out to me to make the audience feel happy.  Remember that the studio took the film from Scott and tacked on that ending, using extra footage from Stanley Kubrick's \\"The Shining\\"!  It wasn't fair, when you hadn't seen a clear sky the entire film, to tack beautiful scenery on at the end.  That took away from everything you'd seen before about enticing people to leave Earth for the Offworld colonies.  Why leave Earth, or even live in the city, when there was still scenery like that to run to?  I thought the ending of the director's cut was much better, leaving it all up to the viewer. <br /> <br />Regardless, no matter which version you see, it's one of the best and most influential science fiction films ever made.

0553383663|2.0|\\"The Google Story\\" is written by heaping praise on the two founders, throughout every chapter. Every sentence, every paragraph implies \\"(The Google founders) Page and Brin are brilliant geniuses!\\".  Now, that may be true. But, it hasn't been proven yet. They have a great track record, <br />and Google is an awesome achievement.  But the reader already knows that. And if they don't, a paragraph or a page  can convey the authors opinion.   <br />But let's hold back on the \\"They're geniuses\\" label <br />until they hit 40 years old. They may be geniuses. <br />Or they may be the latest business-media celebrities. <br /> <br /> So, why is my opinion on the author's writing style relevant to my book review?  Because by telling me that everything the Google founders did was  \\"much more brilliant than their competitors\\" distorts what really happened.  Business success isn't science.  Business success has a healthy element of creating the right product, at the right time.  For one example of the author's gushing, non-critical praise that can confuse a reader on what really happened, the author writes \\"Page and Brin were adamant to do it their way.  They would make no compromises. And the venture capitalists liked their certainty, their moxy.\\"  (This sentence isn't out <br />of context. It's the actual intent of the paragraph.)  <br />Come on, that seems a bit much.  Venture capitalists often meet \\"I know best\\"-type entrepreneurs. <br />What 25 year old PhD candidate do you know who isn't <br />full of self-certitude and a belief that he's smarter <br />than everyone else? Yet the author implies the other Silicon Valley startups didn't have founders with this type of personality. That's one example among many of how the author writes.  <br /> <br /> Within the book, every choice Brin and Page made was perfect. The author implies they could see the future, <br />and they just marched right in and took away from others what was divinely shown to them. When biographers write inthis style, it's revises what actually happened. The author doesn't discuss Page and Brin's fears of failure, confusion, lack of knowledge about business, or any of the other psychological traumas that affect young entrepreneurs starting their first business right out of the University.  Adding some stories of how the founders worked through uncertainty, never giving up, would actually make them seem more determined and more <br />intelligent.  The author doesn't describe their perseverance and certitude.  He just concludes it for you. I believe some examples of how they persevered <br />would have made the book better.   <br /> But hey, maybe the author is correct, and I'm wrong. Maybe Page and Brin just 'knew' Google 'had' to succeed. Maybe I'm reading into the situation, and there truly were no difficult months of confusion on how to handle a specific situation. If that's the case, then I'm just acting like the author, by distorting what happened by over-focusing on one aspect, instead of giving a well-rounded description of the events. <br /> <br /> Personally, I prefer a more even-handed biography, one that communicates the travails of the early days of the business, and not just a non-stop listing of successes. <br />I read \\"The Google Story\\" to learn more about Google's origins, it's current use by business, and it's probable future.  I achieved about 50% of that goal with \\"The Google Story\\". I had hoped I could read just one Google biography. But the \\"The Google Story\\" is incomplete to me. <br />So I'm going to read \\"The Search: How Google...\\". I hope it doesn't contain 50% gushing praises like \\"The Google Story\\".
B000NA2BEU|5.0|Warning!  Spoilers littered throughout this review!<br /><br />Note:  I'll rewrite the following paragraph soon (pressing matters keeps me from doing more right now) but we now know from reliable sources that Veronica is not going to be back in any way.  She will not be back as a college student and she will not be back as an FBI agent in a reworked format.  The only reason the CW hasn't already made the announcement, according to Kristin of Eonline.com, is that they are afraid of the anger fans will heap on them.  They will deserve that anger!  For me the CW will always be the network that made room for a mother-daughter beauty pageant, a second season of the Pussycat Doll show, and THE FARMER TAKES A WIFE.  It had room for absolutely miserable excuses for shows like these, but couldn't find room on its schedule for VERONICA MARS.  That pretty much tells you all you need to know about the CW.<br /><br />I will revise this first paragraph as soon as we know for certain, but it is not true, as has been almost universally reported, that VERONICA MARS has been cancelled.  As of today this is what we know for certain:  it has not yet been placed on the fall schedule.  The head of the CW, Dawn Ostroff, says that while the VERONICA MARS of the past three seasons is gone, she is working with Rob Thomas and Kristen Bell on a possible future project, which most believe means the widely reported successor series to VERONICA MARS, in which the plot would shoot to the future, to deal with Veronica Mars as a FBI agent.  This would be accompanied with a completely new supporting cast and perhaps even a title change in the show.  Numerous sources have reported and Dawn Ostroff herself has stated that she has until June 15, 2007 to make a decision on whether to pick this new series up.  To be honest, not many insiders are offering fans much hope that this series will be picked up.  But as the old expression goes, \\"The opera ain't over until the fat lady sings.\\"  Well, she isn't singing yet, but she might be warming up.  We'll have to keep our fingers crossed that the next three weeks will bring some good news.<br /><br />Certainly we need not fear for the long term future of Kristen Bell.  One of the most talented actresses on TV, she is not only lovely but a gifted actress, singer, and dancer all in one diminutive package.  The question is not whether she will be involved in some project in the future, but which one.  Most immediately it appears that she will be the narrator for GOSSIP GIRL (this might not happen if she plays VERONICA MARS in some way, but even if she does, it might be possible for her to serve as narrator--she did do the narration for the pilot that critics saw at the Upfront in New York).<br /><br />If VERONICA MARS is cancelled and we see no more of our pint-sized but large-spirited teen detective, we can, in a way, be grateful that we got three full seasons.  I fell in love with this show immediately and watched it religiously through its entire run.  When UPN inexplicably scheduled it opposite one of my other favorite shows, LOST, I recorded LOST and watched VERONICA MARS live.  Veronica was when she debuted the latest in a string of strong female characters to have arisen in the wake of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER making TV safe for such creatures.  She was, in fact, the heroine who most resembled Buffy.  The first two seasons were simply glorious, two utterly perfect seasons that topped almost everything else on television.  Season Three, unfortunately, represented something of a slip for the show.  (I refuse it give it less than five stars, however, simply because it was still better than most else on television.)  Many people have felt this and have speculated on why.  My own belief is that VERONICA MARS suffered from network interference.  Both Season One and Season Two were driven by deep emotional needs in Veronica to solve major mysteries.  Season Three had no such deep mystery (though there were two lesser ones) and as a result lacked the emotional intensity of the previous seasons.  No doubt a lot of this was the result of the network putting pressure on the show to make it accessible to new viewers.  We've seen this take place again and again over the years with various shows and the brute fact is:  it doesn't work.  Mainly such an approach wins no new viewers and alienates many of the viewers the show already has.  I spent all of Season Three with a mild feeling of disappointment, yearning for the intensity to return.  Yet, sometimes it did.  \\"Spit and Eggs,\\" which resolved the campus rape mystery, was as stressful and as wonderful as the best Season One and Two episodes, but it turned out to be the exception and the rules.<br /><br />My own thinking on the \\"how to win new fans\\" issue with series is that watering down the show never works.  Instead, I think the way to go is to rely on online streaming and DVD to get potential fans caught up.  I didn't, for instance, start watching FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS last fall when it debuted.  But I was able to catch up by watching it on NBC.com.  The CW put up a few episodes for streaming, but only a few.  What they needed to do was place the entire season online for its shows, much like NBC does.  Serial dramas like VERONICA MARS can attract and build up a fanatically devoted fanbase, but you keep that fanbase by continuing to produce a high quality serial drama, not by forcing it to become more and more episodic.  The truth is that networks almost always complicate rather than improve a series through their meddling.<br /><br />Another perplexing problem with Season Three was the near disappearance of several supporting characters.  At times I wondered if Wallace was still part of the show.  And Weevil played less and less of a role as the season went along.  My understanding is that Francis Capra, who plays Weevil, had some health problems during the season (and that medication he was taking led to a rather startling weight gain early in the year with accompanying skin problems--these seem to be on the way to clearing up by season end).  Mac became an opening credits character, but she didn't seem to play any more important role than she had in the past.<br /><br />Still, some things remained really great about the show.  Veronica and her father continued to have one of the most satisfying, if not the most satisfying, father-daughter relationship on TV.  Veronica continued to impress and overwhelm all those disposed to doubt her.  And as a huge BATTLESTAR GALACTICA fan she made the best frakkin' BSG references on all TV (though Dwight Schruette of THE OFFICE and Seth Cohen of THE O.C. gave her a run for her money), even helping one client find a woman she met at the BSG session at Comicon.  But a lot of the passion of the previous years was gone.  TV critics noticed.  For its first two seasons, VERONICA MARS was probably one of the five most critically praised shows on TV.  In Season Three it probably dropped out of the top ten to somewhere in the 10-15 spot.  I blame this entirely on network interference.<br /><br />The most heartbreaking part of the season came with the finale, which left several plot lines unresolved.  This was not entirely the network's fault.  Rob Thomas obstinately refused to do a \\"just in case\\" ending for the season.  He apparently wanted to increase the pressure on the network to renew the show.  That is one philosophy, but I prefer Joss Whedon's when he was on BUFFY.  His idea was that you never knew whether you would get cancelled (fortunately BUFFY never did, though both ANGEL and FIREFLY would be), so you leave the end of each season in a place where it could both lead into something if you get renewed, but it would be satisfying to the fans if you don't.  EVERWOOD filmed two versions of its Season Three finale in case it didn't get renewed.  It didn't, but thankfully a finale existed that wrapped up the show  Now, unless the FBI Agent Veronica Mars series materializes, we are left with a dangling show.  Moreover, it will dangle most likely regardless, since a time shift to several years in the future will take the show well past the subsequent events on the show.  Networks should do a better job of ending serial drams with dedicated fanbases, but the executive producers need to take some responsibility as well.  I can understand Rob Thomas's reluctance to not go gentle into that good night, but I wish he had filmed an episode that did a better job of wrapping up the series.  As it is, we are left wondering whether the homicidal nutjob Logan beat up got his revenge, whether Jake Kane was once again a part of the show's story, and whether Vinnie Van Low was the new sheriff of Neptune.<br /><br />Television is going to miss this show.  Although NBC debuts THE BIONIC WOMAN in the fall of 2007 (with a crackerjack production staff, a strong cast, and some very good writers, making this look like a more like one of the more promising series of 2007-2008), television is lacking somewhat right now in strong female characters.  In fact, only BATTLESTAR GALACTICA with characters like Laura Roslin, Sharon Agathon, and Starbuck has much in the way of strong women.  I'm delighted that we got to see Kristen Bell portray Veronica for three wonderful years, but I'm still going to miss her mightily.s--these seem to be on the way to clearing up by season end).

B00000637V|5.0|Lou Reed-Berlin *****<br /><br />When released in 1973 the whole world was expecting something commercialy great, what they got was the complete opposite. Berlin is not commercial in the slightest bit, in fact this concidering the time and situation of release Berlin was commercial suicide. Rolling Stone hailed the album as a disaster. That could not be more right. Berlin is aweful, and depressing, taking the listener on a ditortedly paranoid roller coaster ride through a tunnel of schizophrenia, degradation, pill-induced violence and suicide. And that is Berlins most endearing quality.<br /><br />Never before or since has anyone been able to make deppresion and self depracating violence sound so cool and appealing. Lou Reed manages to go from his biggest commercial success with this albums predecesor, Transformer and destroy everthing he earned in a matter of about a half in hour on Berlin. For that he derseves applause. Why? Because while all the critics hated this album upon its release much as they did with The Rolling Stones Exile On Main Street, both of these albums are no concidered to be the best by both artists. While this did not earn the critical aclaim or sell very many copies or even remotly earn minimum air play Berlin is with out question the quint-essential post Velvet Underground release from Reed.<br /><br />Songs like 'How Do You Think It Feels' 'Oh Jim' and 'Caroline Says (1)' seem to playout like happy tragedies. With large German orcastral compositions in the background you almost forget the songs subject matter until the lyrics drag you back to reality. Other tracks like 'The Bed' and 'The Kids' are as blatently sad as anything ever created out of pain. The latter featuring pain shreiking screams from children at the end only adds to the over all effect.<br /><br />Berlin is a rare album in the Lou Reed catologe because while it is not regarded as a commercial album it may very well be the mans most accesable, even more so then the criminaly overrated Transformer.minaly overrated Transformer.

B0000041WV|5.0|Along with Piotr Tchaikovsky, Antonin Dvorak was probably the most prolific composer of the Romance period.  He composed for just about every genre of classical music except ballet, and is known for a wide variety of works.  Some of his most famous are his symphonies.  He wrote 9, out of respect for Beethoven, and like the German master, the last one is the most widely recognized.  But like Beethoven, all 9 symphonies are incredible pieces of music in their own right.  This set has all 9 symphonies, along with several other popular orchestral works.  The sound quality is good, the orchestration is great, and the choice of music is great.  All the pieces are dramatic, with melodies that range from powerful to awe-inspiring to melancholy.  Every piece of music in this set is purely in the Romantic style; full of emotion, and many are inspired by folk tunes from Eastern Europe.   All in all, a great set, and for a great price.

B00002ND77|5.0|Spike Lee's masterpiece, and visually one of the best films ever made. Denzel Washington gives his best performance by far, and probably should have received that year's Academy Award for Best Actor. Losing to Al Pacino for \\"Scent of a Woman.\\" Though as Mr. Washington once expressed, if he had to lose to someone that year, it should only have been to Mr. Pacino for his powerful performance in that film. And until recent years, Hollywood and the white viewing public just weren't ready for a story like \\"Malcolm X\\", and the effort to confront centuries of racism in America. Even denying it any other well deserved Academy Award nominations.  <br /> <br />But to all true fans of cinema, do yourself a favor and view this film, if you haven't already. You will have to agree; powerful film making, even if the subject matter is not to your liking. Some scenes will be offensive to Christians, though we must understand where people are in the world.  <br /> <br />A born again African-American Christian.

0385340559|5.0|Bad luck and trouble: it's what befalls you when you mess with Jack Reacher and the remaining members of his team.  Three points:  a) One cannot rank the Lee Child novels because their quality has been high from the get-go; this one is also superb;  b) This novel begins as more of a procedural than white knuckle/suspense and it plays up Reacher's skill with numbers, their interpretation and manipulation; c) One of Lee Child's particular areas of expertise is his knowledge of weaponry and its capabilities; that is one of the hallmarks of Bad Luck and Trouble, but here we are introduced to LC's ability to describe and characterize the actions of a Bell helicopter.  Very impressive.<br /><br />LC has nearly freed himself from the use of Britishisms in American settings.  Only one here--the use of the word punter in its British sense (tourist/mark).  It's a good word, one that we should adopt.  Aside from that, LC continues to demonstrate his ability to describe American settings with all the skill and sense of detail that we would expect from a native.<br /><br />Great book.  It begins slowly (consciously slowly) and builds to a jackhammer conclusion.  Don't miss it.

He doesn't spend much time giving you the theory behind what this or that button does and how it effects some arcane aspect of composition/exposure. Instead, he tells you, \\"put it on this setting and do this and then take the picture.\\" Once you have some experience using \\"default\\" settings you can then branch out on your own.  <br />I guess some don't like his humor but I think it's great.  <br />If you don't mind a stuffy, textbook style, down and dirty, just the meat kinda book then you will like this one. If not, you should call your local university and ask for the professor that still refuses to use digital and ask him for a recommendation.
B000O5AYCA|5.0|This is the most subdued and interesting record from The National yet, and I firmly believe it will garner them wider attention and praise.  This may not be a positive thing for a band that seems to thrive on being \\"the best thing you've never heard,\\" but after two stellar albums back-to-back, they deserve it. <br /> <br />Boxer is a great example of style and substance combined, and it's likable on so many different levels that it's difficult to cover all the bases even after 5 or 6 attentive listens.  Matt Berenger is a flexible and fascinating lyricist, moving from personal introspection to political commentary to clever, silly wordplay, sometimes all in one song.  In a genre of music where music is written in a very formulaic way, with just the right balance of malaise and heartbreak, Berenger's deep baritone exudes authenticity. <br /> <br />Immediately you will notice that there is no point of release on Boxer--what Mr. November was to Alligator, or Slipping Husband to Sad Songs.  Drummer Bryan Devendorf is just as high in the mix as usual, and his complex rhythms and subtlety (see: Brainy) are striking.  The album maintains a tense balance of tension and beauty that reveals itself to you over time.   <br /> <br />At first I was highly suspicious of claims that The National writes \\"albums that grow on you.\\"  It seemed like music journalists were just trying to cover themselves for completely missing the boat on Alligator the first time around (and they're still using it as an excuse, instead of saying \\"we messed up\\").  But there is definitely some truth to it.  The band throws away their catchiest tunes, because \\"it's the odd ducks that stick with us.\\"  There's very few familiar themes to latch on to, and The National is a band that requires patience and trust. <br /> <br />Boxer is breathtaking, beautiful, and an impressive experiment of sorts: that this band can change their sound, and go in an orchestral direction, while still producing something relevant.

B000P2A256|5.0|But different doesn't always mean bad...I've been listening to this cd for a couple of hours now, and I have to say, it's actually pretty good. It seems like Maroon 5 was going for a more popish (if that's even a word) feel. I kinda felt like I was listening to \\"Sexyback\\" by Justin Timberlake when I first heard \\"Makes Me Wonder\\" because of the club feel. After listening to It Won't Be Soon Before Long for a while, it starts to grow on you. I usually don't listen to pop songs, but I can DEFINITELY make an exception for this. Really good, catchy beats and lyrics...The ONLY song I wasn't feeling in this cd was \\"Better That We Break\\" because I felt like I was listening to a white Stevie Wonder ya know? It just contrasts to the rest of the songs in the album, and doesn't flow with it. Overall, I like this cd. I will definitely be listening to it for a while, and I suggest you pick it up, or download it or Itunes.

141694740X|5.0|I read this book in one day about a month ago. It really is Awesome!  Recently I've been talking to a friend I've had feelings for for years who's currently going through a divorce and saying he wants to date me but yet he's blowing me off. Well, because I read this book I can see all the signs that he's just not that into me and even though he is not man enough to say that to me I already know from this book that #1 A friend is willing to risk the friendship if he's into you, #2 If he's into you he will call when he says he will and give you his attention and #3 If he's into you even if he's going through a divorce or getting out of a serious relationship he will let you know he is into you but it's not a good time for him to pursue another relationship. This book just cuts to the chase and tells women that they deserve better than to put up with a guy who's not that into them---plain and simple. I don't believe in sex outside of marriage so I didn't agree with the authors view about that and I rarely curse which the book does here and there, but I can look past that cuz the book is really friggin' GREAT!!!!! This book is funny, insightful, intelligent, and really truthful with tons and tons of great examples and real-life scenarios---I loved it.

0385751060|3.0|Suspension of disbelief is a large part of fiction writing and reading, but this book takes this beyond the limit. It is written in the style of a children's book, but I can't think of any child I would want to read it. It also seems strange to write a story like this seemingly intended to teach a young reader something about history and what people are capable of when the main character in the book, 9 year-old Bruno is so clueless that he is not aware that there is a war going on or that his own father is the head of Auschwitz concentration camp. How are young readers supposed to understand this if the main character, who is supposed to be living it doesn't understand? Also the writer tries to be cute or clever with words when Bruno thinks throughout the book that the name of the camp is Out-with which in German and polish languages does not rhyme with or sound anything like Auschwitz. I guess this was done because it was written for an English speaking audience, but it is cheesy and is done more than once.

B000002KAT|5.0|Years and years from now, if the world is still in one piece and the human race hasn't made itself extinct, people and history books will hopefully have long forgotten these vapid, celluloid dolts of today (i.e. see Brittany Spears, Paris Hilton, Justin Timberlake, et al...) and remember and revere such artists as Van Morrison.  Well... I guess one can always dream, right?  Damn, I am one naive, lost soul! I still believe that it is 1982 and I am asleep, dreaming this all, waiting patiently to wake up.  This really has to be some kind of joke right?  Anyway, back to the reasons why this CD deserves five stars (actually I would put this one in that rare six-star category if I could).<br /><br />This saintly, little genius from Belfast has produced some of the most beautiful music ever, in the history of beautiful music.  Like Bob Dylan, Van wasn't blessed with a voice a la Sinatra or Tony Bennett.  He was a very good guitar player, but he's not even in the same league as say a Jimi Hendrix or a Wes Montgomery or a Al DiMeola, et al...  And lastly, his lyrics can't compare with that of Dylan's or even Simon and Garfunkel for that matter.  All that being said (and I know that these are some bold words I'm about to pen), I can't think of any one musician that has had as long and as productive of a career as Van Morrison (besides Louis Armstrong of course, but it isn't fair to compare anyone to Pops when it comes to contributions to American music).  This cat is something else for sure!  I love Miles, and Duke, and Sinatra, and the Glimmer Twins, and I highly respect and enjoy quite a bit of Dylan, Paul Simon, McCartney, et al... But this guy is still doing it and hasn't missed a beat in over forty years now!  All I have to say is un-friggin-believable!  He hasn't really slowed down since he first started in the early 60's belting out such enjoyable songs as \\"Baby Please Don't Go\\", \\"Gloria\\", and \\"Here Comes the Night\\" to name a few.  However, in 1967 after leaving the band \\"Them\\" he started getting really serious and his second solo album in 1968 'Astral Weeks' is, to put it mildly, sublime, and magical, and totally unique, unlike anything you have ever heard before or since.  A true genius is almost always an artist who is way ahead of their time, and Van was (and still is) a true genius.  This album is his crowning achievement, his greatest work which is saying a lot when you consider just how many great albums he has produced for going on five decades now - AMAZING!<br /><br />I know, I know, this is only one man's opinion, and you may even consider the author of this review a bit... as my Italian relatives would say... PAZZO!  However, any lover of good music (no matter what your favorite genre is) should really enjoy this.  Van merges jazz, blues, rock, r&b, folk, and a little bit of Celtic music into this one and the results are outstanding.  He sings and plays his guitar beautifully.  Every song contains placid, poetic lyrics that will melt your heart, especially with the solitary way in which Van belts them out with such ardent fervor and emotion.  The other great thing is the band behind the man, the men who helped Van create such magnificent music on this masterpiece are the following jazz greats - Jay Berliner (guitar), Richard Davis (bass), Connie Kay (drums), John Payne (flute, soprano sax), and Warren Smith, Jr. (percussion and vibraphone). They all sound inspired, and it's very difficult to pick out one performance over the others because each one is top-notch.  I usually don't like writing no-brainer reviews, but this album has a real special place in my heart.

B000NVIXFK|4.0|First, Rush can never please everyone all the time with each release. I learned this way back in the day with the 1989 release Presto. A friend at the time and I, both major fans, compared our thoughts on the then new album. We were pretty much diametrically opposed, our respective top to bottom where pretty much in reverse order. THAT taught me that everyone hears and likes something different about each album. And from album to album, least favorites of mine are especial favorites of others. That's how you stay around for 33 years I guess. <br /> <br />Now onto S&A. All I can say it's a breath of fresh air to me. Since Roll the Bones (of course tossing out Feedback), every album has been much like the last, loud, not overly dynamic, and ever so many similes \\"like a ________ on a ________.\\" Not that such doesn't creep up on this album too, but it's not quite so cliche as the music and vocalizations are fresh (or least a return somewhat to many, many years ago). I guess between very similar lyrics, one mode vocal stylings, and loud undynamic guitars, it all seemed very alike. Not that there wasn't some good music, but from Counterparts to Vapor Trails theres about one good album out of it all.  <br /> <br />I guess all it takes is a producers with ideas of his own and the ability to get the guys to go along with it. I've waited a very long time for the guys to experiment a little bit. Break out of the mold that they forced themselves into for whatever reason over the last 15 years. Rush has had three prior peaks, the 2112/Farewell to Kings era, the Permanen Waves/Moving Pictures era, and the Presto/Roll the Bones era. Since then they've churned along without hitting a new highpoint. This just may be it.  <br /> <br />Overall the vocals are fresher (even though I DID find the vocals on Vapor Trails more inspired, perhaps due to Geddy coming off his solo sessions with a new spark), the guitars are fresher, more tastefully used than Test for Echo and Vapor Trails, andeven Pearts drumming is somehow different (I am no where a Peart techy so I can't put it into proper terms). They seem to allow for space and dynamics in the songs. It almost seems that they've all been competing for equal time on every song in the mixing phase, and no one would compromise, so all you got was a constant, dense wall of sound with little range or dynamics. That comes out here.  <br /> <br />And along the lines that everyone has different opinions, it's the first and last song, the ones that get a lot of press, that I find the most cliche all around. I like most of the middle best. <br /> <br />Not a perfect album, and if a start of a new high point, perhaps not as high as some in the past. But it gives me hope that they can knock out a few more before osteoperosis sets in.
B000A7Q2DM|1.0|Consumers should know that this CD is a DRM protected CD and will not be able to be read in most computer CD-ROM drives along with certain regular audio CD players. I recently purchased this CD only to find out that I could only use it in the car and an old CD player I happened to still have. <br /> <br />Like most people I usually rip my CD's to MP3s and do the majority of listening either at my computer or on the go with my MP3 player. This isn't even a remote possibility. Do not support companies and bands that restrict consumer's rights! <br /> <br />This is a Virgin Records CD.

B000LC55F2|4.0|Having enjoyed all of director Christopher Nolan's other films (particularly [[ASIN:B00003CXZ4 Memento]]) I was eagerly looking forward to watching The Prestige. I liked it, was thoroughly entertained, and while one of the films twists is easy to figure out, I was kept guessing up until the end.  Despite all that, there is something empty and hollow about it.  Maybe because the film is structured and unfolds like a magic trick - a set-up followed by the performance and finally the prestige or the effect.  A magic trick is nice to watch, and maybe you think about how the magician did things, but at the end of the day there really isn't a whole lot of depth to it.  As well, there is no character in the film to root for or to despise.  Both magicians are neither hero nor villain.  Like virtually every main character in Christopher Nolan's films, they are men who are driven, defined and ultimately destroyed by their obsessions.  As a result, the two leads don't have a lot of depth to them.  They are only as deep as their obsessions.    From a technical aspect the film is well acted (although Scarlett Johansson is largely wasted), it's well produced and directed, and the screenplay is deviously clever.  Despite its flaws, The Prestige is a film I definitely want to watch it again and is a welcome addition to my DVD collection.  Recommended for anyone who like Christopher Nolan, magic, and movies that keep you guessing.
B000062YAZ|5.0|Personally, I would say this and \\"Seasons\\" are their best albums. \\"Seasons\\" I think one argue is more \\"musical\\", whatever that means.  If you're a young person I can see how this album may sound dated, but you must realize this album was highly influential to many bands to come, in many different genres.  However, there is only one thing I'd like to comment on, which disturbs me reading some of the negative reviews, the lyrics. <br /> <br />First, I don't think Slayer lyrics are meant to be taken too seriously.  I never did when I was a kid, I sure as hell don't now as an adult; you want social commentary, listen to a Dylan record; somewhat abstract introspective, put on some Floyd. And this isn't a knock on those two artists, I like them both-different music for different moods. <br /> <br />Now, the whole Nazi, Mendel thing some people have a problem with, all I have to say is this: who the hell are you to say what is taboo and what someone can or can't write about?  This stuff did happen, didn't it?  There have been some groups throughout our history that burned books, censored what people could say, actually, you know one group that was really famous for this... NAZIS! <br /> <br />If you don't like it, don't buy it or listen to it.  But NEVER demand what someone can or can't say!
B000HCO840|2.0|X-Men: The Last Stand is the second sequel to X-Men, and unlike the first sequel it falls far short of the original.  I could spend a lot of time getting into why Brett Ratner is as much to blame for the this as Joel Shumacher was for the near fall of the cinematic Batman.  We may very well be one sequel away from a screenplay riddled with puns and fight scenes choreographed like a Broadway show or Disney on ice.  Don't hold me to it...all I'm saying is that this disappointing garbage is a few more steps in that direction.<br /><br />X3 (because us American's love for our blockbuster movies to have the shortest colloquialisms possible) mimics the Dark Phoenix saga by legendary comic writer Chris Claremont, and it mixes that arc with a newer story I'm not so familiar with. I'm assuming this is where the idea of the mutant cure comes from.  In short, there is a cure available and it might mean the end of mutants, so we might be tempted to ask ourselves some important questions and a better filmmaker like Bryan Singer may have made these questions far more clear and allowed the answers to cut more deeply.  We've developed differently our whole lives, so how much would we really enjoy being like everyone else on Earth?  What does Mystique, a shape-shifter who prefers to walk around blue and scaley as opposed to adjusting her appearance like we know she can, really think of this opportunity?  What about everyone else and how can a director address this with such a large cast?  Ratner is not up to the task of making these observations interesting...he does however know how to direct straight action and make a highly commercial film.  He did his job.<br /><br />Singer on the other hand brought a tremendous amount of emotion and soul to his films, and he did this without being remotely heavy-handed.  As a bonus he could also deliver straight action, but in his films we actually cared about the characters.  In the second X-Men film we got to see Pyro blast some cops in front of Bobby Drake's house and then we got to see Bobby fly away with the other mutants, but instead of seeing some more explosions and loud jet engines, we see Bobby briefly glance at his family who just betrayed him...and we connect.  Here in X3, I honestly just wanted to see the fire guy fight the ice dude.  I wasn't buying into the characters anymore and the all-too-often clunky dialogue didn't help either.  All the characters that were carried over from the other films are almost just empty shells of themselves from the previous movies, so I felt as if I had to think back to when I gave a damn.<br /><br />But it's not all bad.  Jean Grey's return from death in X2 as the ultra-powerful mutant Phoenix is fun to watch and the film doesn't pull punches to work toward a definitive end to the series (another reason an additional sequel could be dangerous). I'm not a real fan of the comic, but I'm familiar with it enough to know that hardcore fans have countless concerns for how there favorite characters are portrayed.  It's not a horrible movie in comparison to some movies of it's ilk.  The real disdain for me lies in how X3 betrays the depth of the first two films.in front of Bobby Drake's house and then we got to see Bobby fly away with the other mutants, but instead of seeing some more explosions and loud jet engines, we see Bobby briefly glance at his family who just betrayed him...and we connect.

B00005JNS0|5.0|What is up with the obsession that little boys have with this movie?  My almost 2-year-old wants to watch this 3 times a day.  I've met other little boys his age with the same obsession.  Even after the 10th time I saw this movie with my son, I wasn't too sick of it.  I even started to memorize lines so that I had phrases to destract my son when he's cranky.  Great investment.  Great destraction.  Let's us get things done around the house.
B000002B35|5.0|This 1995 live set simply kicks Delicate Sound Of Thunder's butt in documenting live Pink Floyd.  The songs performed here try to stay true to their studio originals.  As with the previous live set, this one also has a video version.  It was recorded in October 1994 at Earls Court in London in support of the Division Bell album.  There is also a complete live performance of Pink Floyd's best-seller The Dark Side Of The Moon which is the highlight of the whole set.  The songs from the classic 1973 release stay to original form.  Another highlight is Comfortably Numb in which David Gilmour probably does his best guitar work ever.  The band members here feel more united than ever before doing their best work without having to contend with Roger Waters.  The feud with Waters during their late-1980's tour probably marred their live performance as documented on Delicate Sound Of Thunder.  Not here.  This is pure, unadulterated live Pink Floyd.
B000NVIXFK|2.0|After the disappointment of Vapor Trails, I was hoping for improvement. Let me start by saying I first saw Rush as a backup band to Kiss in 1974. I have seen them more than a dozen times since. They are probably one of the best live bands ever. Snakes and Arrows does not do them justice. On the first listen, you have trouble distinguishing between the songs. After a few times through you begin to hear the nuances and distinctions. It is definitely better than Vapor Trails but a far cry from their earlier work. There seems to be a dark side to this CD and it left me feeling kinda depressed after listening to it. Long time Rush fans will probably like it, but you have to give it a long listen and then decide.

B000002C1W|4.0|Much as The Final Cut was in reality a Roger Waters solo album albeit it had the Pink Floyd name on it, this album is no different in that it is in reality a David Gilmour solo album albeit the cover has the Pink Floyd moniker on it.  Gilmour worked hard to preserve the integrity of the band name, but most if not all of the songwriting and music is credited to him.  However, this is not to say that the album is bad or lackluster.  Although Nick Mason, Richard Wright, and the other musicians play second fiddle here, Gilmour did an excellent job in keeping everybody together with a common focus.  There is a change of the guard here, not only in band personnel, but also conceptually as well.  The common themes of rebellion, isolation, and materialism have given way to hope for a better world as evidenced in songs such as On The Turning Away.  Pessimism has turned to optimism.  Learning To Fly is an appreciation of one's environment by indulging in the pleasure of flying an airplane, a favorite pastime of Gilmour's.  Without the dictatorial control of Waters, Gilmour could focus on more positive topics.  The Dogs Of War says that sometimes war is necessary in order to maintain a just society as opposed to a condemnation of all war as was the case in The Final Cut album.  Gilmour and company launched a massive and successful world tour soon after the release of this album that stretched all the way to 1989.  The pig balloons were back in full force as well as the airplanes disguised as hospital beds crashing into the stage.  Some things never change.  The album and tour showed that the band's popularity stood the test of time with or without Roger Waters.  A Momentary Lapse Of Reason celebrates triumph over adversity.
B0002OERI0|2.0|When Green Day was just a bunch a kids from the Bay playing around and singing songs about masturbation, they were perfectly in their element.  They were fun, simple, and critic proof. <br /> <br />However, despite the raves of \\"critics\\" who haven't had a finger on the pulse since '83, Green Day has not somehow transformed into The Clash.  They are still just a bunch of rubes, but now they are pretentious rubes, and they are well out of their league. <br /> <br />The music is still simplistic, and in fact, terribly derivative (and I'm not talking about Television or Gang of Four, these guys are ripping off Bryan Adams!)  The lyrics are laughable.  You get more insightful political critique on a Josh Groban album. <br /> <br />Yes, I know they've sold millions and millions of albums, and all these people can't be wrong.  For you people I've got two words, \\"Wild Hogs\\".  Just because something makes a lot of money, doesn't mean it's not crap. <br /> <br />If you really want to listen to a punk album that matters pick up the first Clash album, or Never Mind the Bollocks.  Those albums sound fresher and more vibrant than ever. <br /> <br />Believe me, in a decade no one will even remember tripe like American Idiot.
B000E41MS6|5.0|So, as a child, I remember watching \\"Doctor Who\\" on PBS.  It was a corny, cheesy show that tried to do what could best be described as 'serious camp'.  And then, in the late '80s, it went off the air.  Still, having been on the air for more than thirty years, there were a lot of episodes, and so they still show 'em on PBS.  Then, a few years back, fox made a TV movie, which was disappointing.  So when I first heard of a new 'Doctor Who,' I was leery, and ready to be disappointed again.   <br /> <br />Much to my surprise, the new \\"Who\\" is spectacular...phenomenal...great...(insert positive adjective here.)   <br /> <br />This show is not a re-make.  Instead, it is the same old blue box, same sonic screwdriver, same show... it just picks up some twenty years later.  Of course, there is a new Doctor, played by the versatile actor Christopher Eccleston, and the special effects are upgraded, but the story is the same: The enigmatic Time Lord known as the Doctor travels through time and space, along with his lovely female sidekick (played by Billie Piper), saving humanity from various disasters and alien invasions. <br />   <br />The new 'Who' has fixed so many of the 'corny' aspects of the older episodes, (which were okay when I was ten, but come off as horrible when i look back) and the new Doctor is edgier, tougher, and a bit more of a hardcase than his predecessors.  We come to learn that he is now the Last of the Time Lords, the rest having been wiped out in an apocalyptic 'Time War', and the new shows have a bit more action, drama, and suspense. But it still has plenty of that signature British wit to keep things from looking too grim (Rose says, on meeting the Doctor, \\"If you're an alien, how come you sound like you're from the North?\\" The Doctor replies, \\"Lots of planets have a North...\\"). <br /> <br />There are a few nods to older shows, and the return of some of the Doctor's nemeses from days gone by, so older fans will remember with fondness those early encounters, but it is all presented anew so that new fans won't be lost in a backstory they do not know. <br /> <br />Long story short, this new show is great fun for the whole family, and we can only hope it stays on the air for another thirty years...
B000000OAA|4.0|If your only familiar with the most popular Queen songs get some more of their recordings and experience their great talent. All their early recordings all say \\"No Synthesizers\\". It's amazing what they can do with vocals and Brian May on guitar.
B0000026NC|3.0|If you would ever like to hear Pink Floyd perform live, do not purchase this double live CD.  The songs simply fail to live up to the standards set forth in their studio versions.  This CD set was recorded during the band's 1987-88 Momentary Lapse Of Reason World Tour.  There's also a video version of this concert only the set list is different.  The recording basically highlights the songs from the 1987 release A Momentary Lapse Of Reason rather than the classic Floyd tracks we know and love.  A number of well-known tracks is missing from this set such as Welcome To The Machine, Echoes, Brain Damage/Eclipse, Arnold Layne, See Emily Play, and Astronomy Domine.  This was when there was competition between the remaining Floyd members and Roger Waters.  Roger Waters sued the other three band members because he thought they were stealing the name he assumed he rightfully owned.  Roger released a solo album titled Radio KAOS and subsequently toured in support of that record.  But the venues he was playing in weren't selling as fast as those of his former bandmates.  Competition is one word used to describe the history of Pink Floyd and has been a common theme in the band's music.   But when the smoked cleared, the three-member team of David Gilmour, Nick Mason, and Richard Wright simply ran circles around the one-man army of Roger Waters.
B00005JKHP|3.0|Maybe the title of my review says it all, but here goes. I got to admit, I was somewhat dissapointed with this movie. Although, it was great to see the original crew back from a nearly 10 year hiatus, I have to say that the overall plot of this film was weak. Now I have read reviews saying that this edition has cut out some sub-plots and storylines, so maybe I should watch the original cut, but I just couldn't stay really interested in the overall story. I also think, especially with this edition, the movie was overloaded with too many special effects. Some of the scenes were drawn out just so the effects could be shown. Take the scene when Kirk and Scotty were in the pod boarding the Enterprise toward the beginning of the film. That scene seems like forever. Its just shot after shot of the Enterprise sitting there in space at every angle imaginable while Kirk and Scotty fly around it. Ok, I get the picture..it's the Enterprise..cool shot...now move on please! Another thing is that I don't think the original crew actors had really shaken the rust off yet. They just didn't seem to mesh as well as I had expected. Now I know it seems I'm bashing this film badly, but its not that this is a terrible movie. Maybe I was just expecting better, but I was just dissapointed.
0385340559|3.0|I just finished Bad Luck and Trouble and while it was entertaining, it wasn't typical Jack Reacher.  This new found mathematical skill and the concentration on it was boring.  My appeal to the reacher character was the attributes of his physical abilities along with his very black and white viewpoints.  He's getting a little soft around the edges now and seemed to be a lot less confident.  Please bring back the self-assured Jack Reacher of old.
0316018953|5.0|This book is satisfying on every level and deeply so; besides that, I haven't had as fun a read in a very long time.  It is an outstanding work by an author who makes good prose and the creation of better characters seem effortless.  In essence, a guy gets shot and Detective Bosch goes after the murderer--he goes after nothing else.  Set aside about three hours and take the phone off the hook.  And please, don't ruin the book for anyone else by giving away the ending.<br /><br />Readers of Mr. Connelly are familiar with Connelly's protagonist Harry Bosch to a degree that by now we know the good detective, we know what he is about, we know what drives him and we have learned to trust his instincts.  Indeed, Detective Hieronymus \\"Harry\\" Bosch is among the most well-developed characters in literature of any genre.  His creator has placed Bosch into so many different situations that I was curious as to whether he could continue to keep the character compelling--he can and does.  Convincingly so.<br /><br />The Overlook is driven by plot; it takes place inside a day.  Detective Bosch is now at the height of his powers and is no longer given to doubts--he is about the truth, he knows how important it is and what is best about Connelly's writing, the truth is not ambiguous but absolute.  It is illuminating to witness Bosch as a mentor with a new partner, a young and gifted detective who has yet to appreciate the clarity of Bosch's vision.  In fact, I suspect that new readers will identify quite well with some of Detective Ferras' concerns.  But the true depth of this work is in its portrayal of the fact that Bosch's grasp of essential truths is so strong that he cannot be intimidated or distracted by even the most serious of potential threats and consequences. Bosch acts instinctively and as shown in The Overlook, Bosch is at his best when he trusts himself.<br /><br />Justice is served in a Connelly novel.  Justice in general and justice to the reader who shelled out twenty bucks for a chance to journey with Detective Bosch.  This was my favorite Bosch yet.<br /><br />Highest Recommendationto journey with Detective Bosch.  This was my favorite Bosch yet.    Highest Recommendation
B000OHZJ9Q|4.0|I highly anticipated this release from Prog. Rock greats Porcupine Tree, and I wasn't dissapointed. This album follows the pretty much the same formula, as far as musical style, as their 2 previous albums In Absentia and Deadwing.  But there is some new wrinkles, and some good wrinkles at that. First off, this album's concept becomes more clear than previous PT releases. Themes of this album, as taken from their official website are: \\"a 21st century cocktail of MTV, sex, prescription drugs, video games, the internet, terminal boredom, and subsequent escape.\\"  As usual, Steven Wilson has written some great songs here, both lyrically and musically. Though there are only 6 tracks here, they mesh together very well, so well, they could fit together to become one long track. As said before, musically, the album sounds quite similiar to the last 2 PT releases, with heavier guitar parts mixed with great melodies and beautiful piano pieces that pull you in. And though I really like this album, I cannot automatically give this release 5 stars. One reason is that I think the theme of the album is so apparent, it kinda takes away from the listener's imagination a bit. The lyrics are so direct at times, the listener can't always attach their own meaning to them. For the most part, I enjoy lyrics that say a lot without telling you nothing...if that makes sense. Don't get me wrong, these lyrics aren't bad, not by a long shot. Steven Wilson is an amazing lyricist as well as musician, but I just would have liked for the main theme of the piece to be a bit more indirect. My other complaint, though a small one, is the number of tracks. I know, when writing these kinds of \\"concept\\" albums, an artist should say what they want, and when the theme or message is done, it's done. Whether its 1, 5, or 26 tracks..but as a fan, I'm left wanting more than just 6 tracks. Now,  granted, all the tracks are good lengths, especially with the song \\"Anesthetize\\" which clocks in at over 17 minutes. With that said, I would have to say, in my opinion, is the best overall track on the album. It starts off great, keeps the listener interested, and has great tempo changes, a great balance of musical interludes and lyrics; everything you want from a track of this length.<br /> With all this said, if you're a Porcupine Tree fan or just a prog. rock fan in general, you should love this album, there no reason not to. This is some really good material from this highly underrated band. They have been honing their craft for years, and Steven Wilson and Co. sound crisper and sharper than ever. I look forward to many more great albums from them in the future.th that said, I would have to say, in my opinion, is the best overall track on the album.

B000002UUX|5.0|This is my favourite Megadeth album along with Countdown To Extinction. But Rust In Peace is still better than Countdown in my opinion. <br />Rust In Peace is right up there with Metallica's Ride The Lightning. I know many people prefer Master Of Puppets over Ride The Lightning, but I don't, and I don't prefer Megadeth's Peace Sells... over Rust In Peace. <br />It's all personal preference. I like this, you like that. But that's not what this review is about, so let me get back to the album at hand. <br />In Megadeth's 1990 album Rust In Peace, Megadeth have accomplished an album equal to Metallica's 1984 Ride The Lightning. Even though these albums are 6 years apart, I find them to be very similar. And I am not saying Megadeth ripped off Metallica or that Megadeth are slow learners. Anyway the similarities that I find most stand out are the overall blue colour of the artworks, the crisp yet harsh sound, and the perfect mix of trash and progression, and also I must add that all the songs on both of these albums are my favourite songs by both bands. There is not one song I do not like. <br />I can't help comparing Rust In Peace to Ride The Lightning, just look at the artworks. Then listen to the music, and you too may notice the similarities.  <br /> <br />Rust In Peace & Ride The Lightning FOREVER !!!
B000A0GP0Y|2.0|I don't know if it's the cast I didn't like or what; but it just wasn't good enough for me.  The movie wasn't dark enough in a setting sense. I think a night time game would have been more engrossing and I give the casting a grade of D.<br /><br />  The comedy angle was corny this time around as the new MEAN MACHINE does not jell as a likeable unit; as the original film did.  Too many jerks in this movie, and I didn't buy Sandler as quarterback.
B000OCXFCO|3.0|Quite a lot has already been said as to what makes this album bad and what makes it good. Unfortunately, there is more of the former on this album. \\"Sleepwalker\\" is an okay opener with a great chorus and there's something about \\"Blessed Are The Dead\\" I also really like. But the rest of the album just doesn't do the Megadeth legacy justice. The \\"A Tout Le Monde\\" remake just makes me cringe. I was very pleased with The System Has Failed, so I don't know what went wrong this time around. I'll give it 3 stars (2.5, really) for the parts I do like and for being a longtime fan of the band. Upon subsequent hearings of the album, I've come to the conclusion that United Abominations is a very appropriate title.
B000002AHC|4.0|Replaces a worn out LP.  Actually a 4.25 on the star scale but there is not that choice!
B000OCXMAE|2.0|I think the problem is THIS IS NOT WHAT WE EXPECTED.  LP has been unique and hasn't really sounded like anyone else in the past.  Now, at least in this venture--they sound LIKE OTHER BANDS (i.e. Green Day, Fall Out Boy).<br /><br />  I guess they wanted to prove they can play instuments; and not relying on synchronized beats and hip-hop rhythms as much which predominantly commanded past tunes.  I tried to listen to this CD 3 times; and I get the same feeling......not good at all; WHAT I'VE DONE, and nothing else will be remembered on this one.<br /><br /> Bleed IT out---sounds like some 80's High School Cheer.  Will the real LP please stand up, because you have Fans who are STILL WAITING FOR THE NEW LP ALBUM.
B000O178BY|2.0|First of all, I'm a huge fan of trent, I think he's a huge talent, but this album simply blows. All the songs sound the same, lyrics are pretty dumb and lifeless, and it overall sounds rushed and sloppy. the fact that he's writing about politics makes me cringe.  <br /> <br />listening to this makes me realize why it takes trent 4 years to make an album. if it takes 4 years to make another great album then do it. With Teeth was wonderful, what the hell was this?  <br /> <br />skip this one and listen to The Downward Spiral, Pretty Hate Machine, The Fragile, With Teeth, or any other NIN album other than this stinker.
B0009FU0ZQ|5.0|This is a great little made for TV thriller starring Tom Selleck(Magnum P.I.)and Mimi Rogers(Austin Powers)!!! A modern day film noir thriller!!! Even though this is a made for TV movie,it has solid production values!!! A great little gem from beginning to end!!! Recommended for fans of thriilers and Tom Selleck!!! Five stars!!! A+
B000NVIGC0|5.0|First things first.  If this album came out 35 years ago, it would be regarded as one of the greatest ever recorded in rock n' roll history.  I say that with a straight face.  This fact probably frustrates those looking for more of the \\"experimental\\" work of YHF and AGIB.  That is what is great about this band, and why, in my opinion, and as a person who listens to a lot of different music from a lot of different decades, Wilco is the greatest band to ever make recorded music.  Narrow-minded?  Sure, but that is just my opinion, and I'm sticking with it.  Let's go track-by-track.  Also, splurge for the deluxe edition.  A real bargain. <br /> <br />Either Way - Sure it sounds a lot like \\"In My Life\\".  So what?  It's a perfect pop song. <br /> <br />You Are My Face - What the hell does that even mean?  Who cares?  Great chords, great vocals, great lyrics, great tempo changes, great. <br /> <br />Impossible Germany - More silly lyrics, but also, some of the best guitar work you'll ever hear. <br /> <br />Sky Blue Sky - Watch the DVD that comes with the deluxe edition, and it all makes sense.  Great twangy guitars, a nice country-tinged number. <br /> <br />Side With The Seeds - Sounds like prime Grateful Dead to me.  But better.  More blistering guitar for those who pegged this album as soft. <br /> <br />Shake It Off - Another nod to The Dead.  And again, better.   <br /> <br />Please Be Patient With Me - Gotta have a sappy love song in there, no? <br /> <br />Hate It Here - My favorite track on the record.  It's like 3 Dog Night, Steely Dan, and Rod Stewart's Faces got together and put their all into making a great mid-tempo number with incredible keys, and kitchy lyrics. <br /> <br />Leave Me (Like You Found Me) - A nice acoustic number.  Nothing to get excited about, but, as usual, well-crafted. <br /> <br />Walken - Something Van Morrison may have done if he had an incredibly talented guitar player at his disposal. <br /> <br />What Light - A straight up Dylan rip-off.  Don't forget this is a man (Tweedy) who makes it no secret he wishes he was him (Bob Dylan's 49th Beard).  A perfectly executed rip-off. <br /> <br />On And On And On - Written for his father after his mother died, and a little hint of the soundscape type music from YHF and AGIB.  A hint of a return on the next album, or a swan song? <br /> <br />Yes, I love this band unabashedly.  No shame here.  Go see them live if you never have.  They'll blow your mind.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|I have been a RUSH fan for over 15 years. It's my favorite band. I enjoy this new album. It's a mix of Coutemparts and Vapor Trails. If you're a true Rush fan, buy it now and enjoy each minutes, song by song. Rush rules...
B00006CJOY|5.0|This is a great album, it makes you feel good, makes you want to get up and dance to the music. <br />A good stress buster, and a lot of fun.
B000OCXMAE|4.0|First, i will like to say that when I first heard Linkin Park I did not like them.  This may be attributed to the fact that I generally dislike the rap-rock genre.  But Linkin Park, as proved by thier last albums, has an ability to write unique music that eventually grows on you or immediatly strikes a chord with you.  As with all of their last albums, listening to Minutes to Midnight will take some time for original fans to warm up to.  I waited until I had listened to the album a number of times before writing this review so that I would be able to truly understand the songs.   <br /> <br />Overall, I think the best feature of this album is the diversity of songs and moods present.  Minutes to Midnight ranges from angry-politically driven songs (similar to Rage Against the machine w/out much of the rap) to deep emotionally written soft ballads that would fit smoothly in 80's pop radio. <br /> <br />Though the album generally is a new step in musical direction, it doesn't completely diverge from what fans could expect.  This is not an \\"Ava Adore\\" cd like what the Smashing Pumpkins did!  I noticed that the album uses different instrumentation (even experiments with jaggling keys and hand claps!) when compared to the keyboards and scratches from the old linkin park.  Songs like Given Up, What I've Done, and arguably the ballad songs (think My December) are not too different.   <br /> <br />My favorite song doesn't show up intil the end, with The Little Things Give You Away.  Rick Rubin and the guys of Linkin Park suprise us with Beach Boys singing harmony in a deep political song.  There is even a sweet guitar solo which is rare in Linkin Park! <br /> <br />Overall, I enjoyed the album and I know it will continue to grow on me with each listen!
B000MTPANQ|4.0|Very good acustic concert, very simple and intimate. <br />For fans only, not an essential album.
B000P2A256|5.0|this is a kind of album that makes you wanna dance and sing along. <br />really cheerful melody and beat plus typical and unique adam's sexy vocal~ <br />i started to listen to this album 2 weeks ago when its leaked and can't get rid of it.its great cos after listened to that a couple of times i preordered this and expectin my copy~ <br />its gonna be a huge hit of this year~
B00000DGXN|4.0|This is a great collection of really excellent Jazz.  Gary Burton is on his game.
B000FQJAIW|4.0|Please note this is not a review of the re-release dvd but the film itself.<br /><br />What can I say about this film? It basically did what 2001 did for the sci-fi genre back in 1968 what this did in 1977 and in someway still does 40 years after it's release.<br /><br />It was one of the best ones of my childhood to watch with my father, who both him and my mother would tell me stories about watching the film at the drive-in back in 1977 and going \\"Ohhh\\" to seeing the stardestoryer on the screen for the first time.I never got to have that experience til 1997 with the 30th Anniversary Special Edition.<br /><br />Staring big name actors,unknown ones,an excellent script,an excellent villian,awesome score and an somewhat interesting message,makes Star Wars A New Hope a powerful and wonderful film to watch.

0688170528|3.0|I am a bit over half way through with this book and getting bored.  Is there a surprise twist to it?  Or am I going to truge through only to find that Emily was daunted over what is obvious by now and that's it?
0783225725|3.0|Don't get me wrong, I like these old Eastwood westerns as much as the next guy, but this movie is almost a direct steal from a \\"Bonanza\\" eisode called \\"Twilight Town\\" that aired ten years before this movie came out. I have no respect for plagiarism no matter who stars in the movie. I did give it a few for entertainment value.
B00000FZ1V|5.0|They don't make them like this anymore.  Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis, and Ernie Hudson bring \\"Ghostbusters\\" to paranormal comedic heights.  The movie starts with an ominous tone, but travels straight into comedy with one of the best comedy scenes ever with Bill Murray testing two university students for \\"the effects of negative reenforcement on ESP ability\\".  The comedy (and the supernatural suprises) grow from there.<br /><br />It's a fine example of comedy with a heart, with a soul.  The kinds of comedy I wish was still around in movies today.
B00000G6TL|5.0|THE BAND: Over the years - Rod Evans (vocals), Ian Gillan (vocals), David Coverdale (vocals), Joe Lynn Turner (vocals), Ritchie Blackmore (guitar), Tommy Bolin (guitar), Steve Morse (guitar), Nick Simpler (bass), Roger Glover (bass), Glenn Hughes (bass)..... Jon Lord (keyboards) and Ian Paice (drums & percussion) have appeared on every Deep Purple release.<br /><br />THE DISCS: (1998) 28 total tracks on 2 discs clocking in at approximately 138 minutes (70 minutes on disc-1, 68 on disc-2). Included with the discs is a 22-page heavy duty glossy purple booklet containing an extensive 15-page history of the band, song titles, and what songs came from which albums and year released (sadly no band photos or song lyrics). This compilation follows the band from 1968-98. Digitally remastered sound. Label - EMI Records.<br /><br />ALBUM REPRESENTATION: Shades Of Deep Purple (2 songs), Book Of Taliesyn (3), Deep Purple (1), A's & B's (2), In Rock (4), Fireball (2), Machine Head (3), Who Do We Think We Are (1), Burn (2), Stormbringer (1), Come Taste The Band (1), Perfect Strangers (2), Slaves & Masters (1), Purpendicular (1), Abandon (1), unreleased - \\"When A Blind Man Cries\\" from the \\"Machine Head\\" sessions - released on the 2-disc Anniversary edition only (1).<br /><br />COMMENTS: A collection like this has been a long time coming. A band with such a deep and rich rock history deserves such a tribute. There are several compilations out there, but this double disc set is worth the search (and I truly believe the single disc mixes simply can't do the band justice). Disc-1 concentrates on the early years, 1968-72 only... the sound is dated, but so much of the music from the late 60's is (the remastering helps a tad bit, but not much). Disc-2 has a much broader ranger - following Deep Purple from 1972 through 1998. THE GOOD: Most, if not all, the staples are here - \\"Hush\\", \\"Black Night\\", \\"Speed King\\", \\"Child In Time\\", \\"Strange Kind Of Woman\\", \\"Fireball\\", \\"Highway Star\\", \\"Smoke On The Water\\", \\"Woman From Tokyo\\", \\"Burn\\", \\"Perfect Strangers\\", \\"Knocking At Your Back Door\\", \\"King Of Dreams\\", \\"Ted The Mechanic\\", etc. The history contained in the liners notes is extensive. Chronological order is a plus - you can hear the band really mature over the years with their sound and line-up changes. Great remastered sound (especially) on the later era material. Many of the tracks are \\"Anniversary\\" remasters and/or remixes of which Roger Glover produced. THE NOT SO GOOD: Minor things really. I understand 6 songs from the early Rod Evans era is probably necessary here, but I was never a big fan of the 60's Deep Purple. Track 2, \\"Mandrake Root\\" - as much as it the liner notes say it's an early penned Blackmore treasure... I find it 6 minutes of absolute Hell to get through. \\"Hard Road (Wring That Neck)\\" sounds more like ELP than Deep Purple thanks to Jon Lord's overbearing keyboards. The crooning vocals in the middle of \\"The Bird Has Flown\\" are downright scary. This \\"DP 30 : Very Best Of\\" does a very good job taking songs from the wide catalog of Purple's albums over the years, but some albums were passed on - \\"Made In Japan\\" (and several other live albums), \\"House Of Blue Light\\", \\"The Battle Rages On\\"... and \\"Bananas (2003), \\"Rapture Of The Deep\\" (2006) released after the fact. No representation from one of the best live rock albums of the 1970's (\\"Made In Japan\\") is simply wrong. DP was always a great band live and there should have been at least 1 live track here. Several songs are missing - the most critical being - \\"Space Truckin'\\", \\"Mistreated\\", and \\"The Mule\\"; as well as some other deserving songs like \\"\\"Spanish Archer\\", \\"Anya\\", \\"Sail Away\\", \\"Lick It Up\\", \\"You Fool No One\\", and \\"Lazy\\". Utilize the space - between the 2 discs there is 22 unused minutes. OVERALL: \\"30\\" represents an excellent mix of Deep Purple tracks despite a few minor things wrong (and what compilation is perfect?). I firmly believe this is their best compilation to date - too bad it's now considerd an import. Lots of music from a legendary band, digitally remastered sound, classic Deep Purple songs (5 stars).port. Lots of music from a legendary band, digitally remastered sound, classic Deep Purple songs (5 stars).
6304711905|5.0|\\"Tombstone\\" is a classic American film of honor and nobility.  In a time when villains openly used force, true heroes stood up to these men not because they were tough guys, but because they knew they were right.  It provides a fine example of how cowards and bullies rely on fear and intimidation to gain their power, and how one needs only be strong to stand up to them.<br /><br />Kurt Russell plays one of the most conflicted, yet noble characters with gravitas and strength.  Val Kilmer as \\"Doc Holliday\\" steals the show as the southern gentleman with an unfortunate affliction and deadly vices.  The Villains, led by Powers Booth as Curly Bill, are fantastic and able acting foils to the protagonists.  The entire cast is strong and the script is outstanding.<br /><br />This movie should be a standard for every young man on the nobility in honor, the value of intelligence and education, and the merits of being a gentleman.

B000OCXMAE|3.0|I, like most people here loved Linkin Park's flawless blend of rap-rock and normally I'm not a fan of rap or the mixing of it into other music. Hybrid Theory and Meteora changed my mind and were excellent albums but Minutes to Midnight is missing that rap-rock mix and the uniqueness of dueling voices we all enjoyed in Chester and Mike. Those two things set them apart and without it, they sound much like Trapt. This may very well be one of those \\"grow on you\\" albums but by changing their sound all they did was become more mainstream.

B000QQFKYE|5.0|haha,this film really pissed off quite a few people so i've heard.i saw it at the oak street cinema in mpls with friends in march and was very satisfied while they were not.it's funny too,because the folks who fancied themselves \\"artsy\\" were the first to dismiss it as \\"too long,too over-the-top,and too meaningless.\\"(i admit to keeping the abstract nature of it a secret from them all so i wouldn't have to go alone though.)anyways,to the film itself:formalism+surrealism=the best experimental neo-noir experience i've had in many a moon!simply because of how long it is(3+ hours)i even found myself droning in a trance at some points--BUT--this works to the film's advantage(with the dvd format at least)because you'll be able to stop it at basically any point you because tired of it,start it up a few hours/days later,and not \\"miss\\" anything.if there is a \\"random play\\" option on most dvd players it would totally work to suffle the chapters and still be able to not make sense of it or find abstract meaning(that is,if david gives us chapers on the dvd which he normally doesn't.)i'll try to wrap this up now as simply as possible:inland empire is unmistakable a david lynch film(fits the auteur's overe quite nicely),it's mainly dark with character's finding a sickness inside themselves and thier surroundings,it's like mulholland drive as a mosaic--suffled beyond recognition,it pays homage to various films(rear window,sunset boulevard,etc),and i can only assume that it was as fun and interesting for lynch to create as it was for me as a viewer to watch.as per usual,the asthetics and chirascirro are top-notch!can't wait to see what david has in store for us on the dvd!<br /><br />*edit:10/24/07<br /><br />The dvd:<br />I finally got around to watching the extras disc last week.This dvd set has so much to offer;thanks Mr. Lynch for adding so much into it.The biggest thing that I noticed was that the film has half the power that it did on the big sceen when translated through my 17-inch Toshiba at home.My system speakers didn't honor the sounds too well eathier,but hey,I suppose that proves that Inland Empire has another power to it.I wasn't disapointed with the film itself after seeing it for the second time,but I wished that my toys could have held up their part of the bargain better.It's interesting to think that a film which was shot on dv  looks its best when shown on a large screen!<br /><br />The extras were very cool and it was interesting(and a shock) to see that Mr. Lynch isn't the \\"24/7 hunkey-dorey boy scout\\" which so many people pigeonhole him into.He's a normal guy with a fully-developed imagination!<br /><br />I never knew about quinoa before seeing this and I'll be getting much more protien via this rich grain!Haven't tried it yet but it looks good.<br /><br />\\"More things that happened\\" was fun,and I can see why the scenes didn't make the final film,but they stand on their own just fine.<br /><br />I should also mention that I had no problems at all with the dvd freezing on me,or anything else mentioned by others.My copy seems to work fine.<br /><br />With that said,I think that INLAND EMPIRE is still the imaginative masterpeice I claimed it was after seeing it at the Oak Street Cinema.Hollywood can't make their junk movies with \\"junk\\" dv,but smart film-makers can get around the problems of digital video to create amazing films for a relatively low cost.I'd rather view a smart film with a few minor visual quirks than be forced to sit through conventional factory movies made by dunces--even if they happen to be shot on high-def.The art of film reverts back to the grainy place it was born;how fitting and awesome!<br /><br />And no David,I won't be putting it on my effing phone..My system speakers didn't honor the sounds too well eathier,but hey,I suppose that proves that Inland Empire has another power to it.I wasn't disapointed with the film itself after seeing it for the second time,but I wished that my toys could have held up their part of the bargain better.It's interesting to think that a film which was shot on dv  looks its best when shown on a large screen!

B000002ADT|5.0|I was first introduced to jazz in 1997 after listening to the Love Jones soundtrack which included \\"In A Sentimental Mood\\" by Ellington and others.  I cannot describe in words how deeply moved I was by that song especially being a part of the hip hop generation.  I decided to explore this genre a little more and I'd always heard of the great trumpeteer Miles Davis.  I knew he was a jazz player but no more.  So I decided to purchase something by him in and \\"Kind of Blue\\" was the album available in the music store at the time.  Again, I'd received no advice on what and who album to purchase.  That Fall when I heard this album for the first time, I remained still in my bed with my eyes closed.  This album not only touched but stirred my soul.  Time for a brief moment was at a stand still, and I loved every moment of it.  This happened at the tender age of 20 and this album is still in heavy rotation along with many other jazz musician.  I am a die hard \\"Coltrane\\" fan but this album is by far the jazz album that will leave a footprint on my soul!
B000067IZ3|5.0|Thought provoking, suspenseful, illuminating and candid. Actors love working for Steven Soderbergh and it shows. Each role was well developed and fully realized on screen. This movie is powerful!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This series about our precious planet earth is gorgeously and reverently created. I loved every minute! How fortunate we are to have the treasures shown.
B00004WEJZ|5.0|Even though it isn't officially part of the Bond series as far as canon is concerned, \\"Never Say Never Again\\" is still a solid Bond film that all fans need to buy if they have never seen it and want their collection complete. Sean Connery, who is actually younger than Roger Moor who was doing Octopussy at the same time, shows that he is Bond and no one can play that character the way he does. The only thing this movie doesn't is other familiar actors known in the Bond series, different people  playing Moneypenny, M,  Q and the first African American to play Felix (Casino Royale wasn't the first) is seen in this movie.<br /><br />There are a few future stars in this film, mainly the sexy Kim Basinger and the funny Rowan Atkinson who would later be known as Mr. Bean! Yes, Mr. Bean is in this movie. Overall, this is fun and never loses the Bond spirit. The movie is fun, which is the intention since Sean said prior to the film that he would never play Bond again, which they joke reference at the end of the movie and were they got the title of the movie from. This is definitely worth buying, it is rarely seen on TV and won't probably ever be included in a set of Bond movies, but it is still worth buying separately.
B00003CWL6|5.0|I really liked \\"existentialist\\" lit and those  Russian literary genres (pathetic character dramedy) when I was a teenager but can no longer stomache them.  I never cared for the work of Kaiser Soeze.  I find mid-life crisises to be a boring subject.  Many of the details are absurd and hard to swallow.  I'm not a fan of fractured plots esp. plots that start with the ending - what could be more played out?  starting with the main characters death is not new or clever (like in \\"The Posthumous Memoirs of Bras Cubas\\"from the 1800s -or a more direct cinamatic comparison \\"Sunset Boulevard\\" with the main characters voice over and sympathetic conclusion to the love triangle before the big finale).<br /><br />But I do appreciate that amalgam of literary, theatrical and clean cinematic/TV writing styles that went into the story.  And I liked the look of the film.  I'm sure it deserves all it's praise.
0307275639|1.0|The dying old man had less wisdom to offer than your average self-help book.     At first, I found myself getting into the whole teary-eyed thing. But about half way through, I was so tired of the unrelenting attempt by the author to make me cry, that the book started to annoy me. In spite of this, I read to the end, hoping for something enlightening, which was even more annoying because it never came.     And if all that weren't enough, the old man's political views had to be sprinkled in for good measure. Even in dying, we have to interject polically correct nonsense?
0793518326|5.0|This book has everything. I use it all the time.

B000AP04L0|5.0|I just wanted to add a little challenge. When you watch this movie again and again (and you will) try to catch exactly how many times Milton either outright states or almost imperceptibly mutters that he is going to set the place on fire. &lt;grin> The first time I watched it I was so busy laughing that it never registered even once. <br /> <br />
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is truely a beautifully filmed collection of amazing images of planet earth.  It is a must have for your DVD collection. I have revisited each DVD in the series several times and it seems I find something new I hadn't seen in the earlier viewings.
B000001DVD|4.0|Will the real Def Leppard please stand up? On their debut LP the band were fairly stock standard NWOBHM dudes. On later releases they alternated between ground breaking production jobs from Mutt Lange (also the producer of this) and soulless trend following losers. Here we find the band playing heads down hard rock presumably heavily influenced by Back in Blacks success.<br /><br />And they made a pretty good fist of it. In fact due to it's heads down passion this album stands up decades later. Opening blasts of rifferama like Let it Go, Another Hit and Run and High 'n' Dry (Saturday Night) ride thick full bodied riffs while Bringin' On the Heartbreak is probably their besst ever ballad and tellingly was written before ballads were the bands reason to be. Side two - in the old money - doesn't have the highlights but such is it's solid recording, youthful swagger and desire to conquer that the tunes retain a certain hard rock honesty.<br /><br />Def Leppard were never metal but on this album they deliver their most pounding and raucous hard rock, the sort of wattage that must of reduced many club dates to sweat soaked rubble. An album best played at volume and all up a totally viable slab of riff driven hard rock. Dig in.
0743298020|2.0|All I could think from beginning to end was how incredibly trite the whole thing was. It's a fast airport read I guess, but I don't even know if I would recommend it for that. I suppose I wanted to know the outcome, but I figured out the \\"twist\\" long before it was revealed and it made finishing the book a chore. Super light reading.
B000001FKY|5.0|17 million people can't be wrong presumably. But they can give it a pretty good shake. And that is the real issue here. So because I'm a benevolent soul you guys are gonna get two, yep two reviews.<br /><br />The first goes a bit like this;<br /><br />After taking three years to get around to having this ablum done the band were really at risk of losing the momentum garnered through Pyromania. But they were ready and willing to take the risk. And the time spent in the studio can be felt in the arrangments, the choral effects, the technology of this album. Of course now it doesn't sound so amazing, but much of this was done before a lot of the computerised tricks of latter day productions even existed. The work that went into producing this hard rock monolith is pretty extraordinary.<br /><br />And the huge hits are a testament to the experience of the band. Single after single flew up the charts in various territories and rewarded all those who worked on the project. The lushness of the production means that the chorus' sound huge while the verses, which are often carried by the rhythm section in an almost minimalist way, still sound full bodied.<br /><br />And the track sequencing is pretty clever too, a judicious blend of rockers with bite, party rockin' tunes and ballads. Love and Affection may not work but other than that pretty much every track has something about it. And this means that this album is dragged upwards to be a classic hard rock album.<br /><br />But then here is #2;<br /><br />The descent into utterly technology dependant rubbish is here complete. This band, who started as NWOBHM rockers and who were heavily AC/DC influenced on their second album, have here descended into an impotent mess with all the human feel of a Dalek. The guitars are, well they are largely what Prodigy and NIN would call guitar textures and are barely recognisable as coming from the same band that released some of those earlier records. And nowhere on the album is there anything as psychologically thought out or ambitious as Die Hard the Hunter (nope, Gods of War don't come close). No storytelling, no poignancy and no real reason to exist and like circus balloons the whole thing is full of air - no substance at all, right down to the cover art which looks like the album sounds, technologically dependant. It actually looks like the promo for some dodgy sci-fi movie from around 1985.<br /><br />So this album is either five stars or none, take your pick!ing as psychologically thought out or ambitious as Die Hard the Hunter (nope, Gods of War don't come close). No storytelling, no poignancy and no real reason to exist and like circus balloons the whole thing is full of air - no substance at all, right down to the cover art which looks like the album sounds, technologically dependant.

B000N3ST8O|2.0|Rating CD Only:  I feel that Stevie Nicks is a great talent, but The CD sounds very flat.  There's no pizzazz to it; boring to listen to.  This in no way reflects on the artist, it reflects on the way the CD was produced, remixed or whatever.
B000001F7R|3.0|And here it is, Leppards debut album and it's not half bad. Excellent stompers like Wasted and Rocks Off backed up by solid hard rock such as It Don't Matter and Answer to the Master help lay the foundation for one of the hard rock genres biggest beasts. The outright rawk rock of High 'n' Dry as well as parts of Pyromania have their genesis here. The intro to Rocket from Hysteria has it's roots in Satellite and the bands pandering to the US market is also born here with Hello America.<br /><br />In fact the work debut is so perfect for this album. The slightly cheesy hard rock of Pyromanias heavier tracks is here prequeled by Rock Brigade and by a very very long stretch I can visualise the relation between Desert Song from the Retro Active disc in the apocalyptic feel of When the Walls Came Tumbling Down.<br /><br />The youth and inexperience of the band are there for all to hear but it's forgiveable because at the end of the day most purchasers of this collection of NWOBHM sonics is buying it as a historical document and not because the dorky band name amuses them - lets face it everyone reading this review knows who Def Leppard is and their story right! And as such it's easy to forgive the inexperience especially when you consider that they got their act together quickly and you know just how hard these guys worked from day one.<br /><br />PS - Am I the only one bemused by the fact that On Through the Night (the song) doesn't actually appear on On Through the Night (the album)?? Only in the NWOBHM!
B000P2A256|5.0|Another classic album from Maroon 5. My favourites are: Makes me wonder, wont go home without you, cant stop thinking about you,goodnight goodnight and nothing lasts forever. The bonus track infatuation is a nice track as well. \\"Go buy the album dont download\\".
1582701709|1.0|This book is skilfully marketed to convince people that some new truth is about to be revealed here. But nothing of the sort takes place. It is simply a flashy repackaging of some very old ideas: new age thought, eastern religions, the human potential movement, positive thinking, pantheism, cosmic consciousness, and so on.<br /><br />The message is simple: you and I are God, are energy, are the universe, are perfection, are spirit, etc. As such, \\"you can have, be, or do anything you want\\". That's it. Want a brand new car? Visualise it and receive it. Think and feel that you already have it.<br /><br />Want a perfect partner? A new home? Perfect health? A new job? A million dollars? It's all yours. Just claim it. Receive it. No more negative thoughts. Just think happy, positive thoughts and anything you desire is yours. It is the creative visualisation message made popular in the New Age Movement: you create your own reality. You script your own destiny.<br /><br />Of course this mind over matter thought has been around for ages. Indeed, Byrne assembles 24 \\"great avatars and amazing teachers\\" here whom she quotes and rephrases. Some have already passed on, however, which is curious, since we are promised in this book both perfect health and \\"eternal youth\\". So why have they carked it?<br /><br />Indeed, many such questions arise. We are told we should always be grateful; we should always say `thank you'. But to who? It seems to ourselves, since we in fact are God, the universe, energy, the all. We are the ones who make our own reality. Everything that exists is the product of our thoughts, our feelings.<br /><br />And given that \\"you deserve to be happy,\\" then just claim all those goodies you have always longed for. Got bills to pay? No probs! Got cancer? No worries. It will all disappear if we simply want it to.<br /><br />But wait, there's more. It is not just personal greed that is being pandered to here. It is not just my own dreams that can come true. The big issues of life are also a piece of cake. Want to end global hunger? Easy. Just think happy food thoughts. Want to end all war? Couldn't be simpler. Just feel and think peaceful thoughts. And you thought some problems were just too intractable. Foolish you.<br /><br />Indeed, you can have a lot of fun when you are the centre of the universe. You can have a blast being God. You can really groove on being perfection. Isn't it great that it is all about you? Consider this closing thought of the book:<br /><br />\\"The earth turns on its orbit for You. The oceans ebb and flow for You. The birds sing for You. The sun rises and sets for You. The stars come out for You. Every beautiful thing you see, every wonderful thing you experience, is all there for You. Take a look around. None of it can exist, without You. No matter who you thought you were, now you know the Truth of Who You Really Are. You are the master of the universe. You are the heir of the kingdom. You are the perfection of life. And now you know The Secret.\\"<br /><br />And her very last line? A paraphrase of Stars Wars, no less: \\"May the joy be with you!\\" Gee, almost makes me feel like soaring through the air, forming some new galaxies, and creating other worlds.<br /><br />If it all seems a bit familiar, that is because it is. It is just old-fashioned Eastern thought, repackaged and resold to a gullible new generation. It is plain old monism and pantheism with a facelift. It is just more New Age thought in drag. It is simply positive thinking in a new dress.<br /><br />Oh, and one final thought: I tried to do what the book suggests: use the Law of Attraction to get whatever you want. Unfortunately it did not work for me. I told the gal at the counter I wanted to get the book for free, and was using the Attraction principle to create my own reality.<br /><br />She did get a chuckle out of that, but still demanded cold hard cash, insisting that moolah, not some Attraction mumbo-jumbo, was the only way I was going to get the book. Thus I am $30 poorer, and still not able to script my wishes into reality. Oh well, guess I just gotta try harder.he only way I was going to get the book. Thus I am $30 poorer, and still not able to script my wishes into reality. Oh well, guess I just gotta try harder.
B00007LTIA|5.0|I have had this on vinyl, first issue CD, first remaster, and now this Rhino remaster.  This to me was the first Yes album that really sparkled in terms of sound quality and production.  It could almost have been recorded in 1994 as much as 1974.  Despite the misgivings of some fans and critics, there is great music on this album.  The Remembering is a bit short on ideas, but Ritual is one of my absolute favourites, and which Yesfan couldn't thrill to the stereo pans at the beginning of The Ancient.  The studio run throughs are interesting if not essential.  I did enjoy some of the passages on the early version of The Ancient - sounded quiet different but would have worked equally well.  What isn't made clear in any documentation i have seen is that there is an additional minute or so at the opening of The Revealing Science Of God. i think this first appeared on the version on The Word Is Yes, and it is a welcome addition.  Do you need this?  It is marginally better than previous versions, but i wouldn't be without it.  With sleevenotes, additional material and beautiful packaging, i think it is worth it, especially at such a good price.  Long live Yes!
B00003CXAE|5.0|This movie is just a classic and always a good time to watch.  It's pretty harmless and just puts you in a good mood.  I saw this movie about 25 times when I was growing up and it came out, so I was pleased to see it on a DVD so I can watch it and not wear out the tape!
B0006A9FKA|5.0|Anyone who appreciates British humor should love this movie. The gory parts are done so well, gross enough for me (the more guts, the better) but are also hilarious so that they do not bother the faint of heart too much (like my sister, who avoids bloody horror movies). I am glad that I bought this for myself, I'll watch it again and again. And for those people for whom I have given it as a gift, they have thanked me again and again!!!
B000O75F7C|5.0|I caught the Porcupine Tree bandwagon around '01 because of Opeth.  My first experience with them was the 'Signify' album.  Didn't blow me away, but I thought it was really good: artful, quietly intense, mostly beautiful.  I've since collected nearly all their material, 17 years worth.  FoaBP is a beautiful, intense, and artful record.  It's both hard-driving and heart-breaking.  The musicianship is understated and incredible.  It amazes me when someone is able to make a good rock album after over a decade in the business, let alone something this good after over 15 years.  Highly recommended for anyone who likes Pink Floyd, Tool, or Radiohead even a little bit.
2218922622|5.0|Conjugation in french it is not an easy matter. This book is excellent for helping you to find how conjugate a verbe, whatever is the time (present, passé composé, future, imparfait, etc) you are looking for. Moreover, its size is an advantage because is a book easy of carrying on.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|This is a thoroughly unclassifiable album.  It's a bombastic composition that REALLY REALLY works, and never FEELS like it's over the top, even though it really is over the top.  It's TOTALLY over the top, and sometimes sounds like that the band members are singing and playing at the edge of their control, even though they're not.  It's wild, unpredictable, and sometimes drifting over that cliff for a moment before wandering back...which simply adds to the experience. <br /> <br />How good is this album?  When you're listening you wish it would never end, except that you NEED it to end so you can get off the roller coaster ride it takes you on, and get back to the real world. <br /> <br />Chamber music?  Sing-along?  A eulogy?  Oooh-oooh-oooh's?  Pounding drums? <br /> <br />Growling guitars & bass juxtaposed with violins and french horns that drift from beautiful harmony to uncomfortable discord and back again? <br /> <br />A night at the symphony?  Rock anthems?  An album about death that's not actually sad?  Massive tempo changes?  SCREAMED, not sung, lyrics, here and there?  Lyrics that surprise you when you figure out the point?  A lead singer who sounds like he might be on the verge of tears one minute and might end up smashing his mic stand through a bass drum the next??? <br /> <br />Yes, all of the above. <br /> <br />Think, \\"what if the Beatles had put out Abbey Road as their first album?\\" (what if you set the bar so high you can't ever get there again?)   <br /> <br />Does it rock?  Yes, quite a bit. <br /> <br />Does it make you think?  Yes, quite a bit. <br /> <br />Does it rip your heart out and stomp all over it, and then put it back while it's still beating?  Yes, it does that too...all while you're stomping your foot or pounding the steering wheel.  You get the feeling that with every listen, you'll pick up something new. This album is so sonically deep and sumptuous that it would be hard to not hear something new on each listen, unless of course you're just singing along with it, which you might very well be. <br /> <br />(and to think that everyone says that they're even better live) <br /> <br />The hallmark of a great album is that it gets better upon each listen. Give it FIVE spins.  If you don't like it, just get rid of it because you'll never like it.  If you like it, you'll probably love it. <br /> <br />If you can listen to Regine's impassioned and imperfect wails above the violins and horns during \\"In the Backseat,\\" and not FEEL anything, forget it.  Otherwise, enjoy. <br />
6305922756|5.0|I'm a huge metal fan. Whether hair metal, old school, nu metal, alt-metal, prog metal or death metal, I like 'em all. We're talking Slipknot, Iron Maiden, Korn, Poison, Nirvana, Tool, Anthrax, System of a Down, Savatage, Alice In Chains, Faith No More, Lamb of God, Queensryche, Sepultura, Shockplate and many more. And with that enjoyment of heavy metal comes an appreciation of the greatest rock satire of all-time:  <br />\\"This Is Spinal Tap.\\" <br /> <br />Directed by Rob Reiner (\\"When Harry Met Sally\\") -- who also doubles as budding documentarian Marty DiBergi -- this mockumentary follows the floundering career of the once-great Spinal Tap. Led by guitarist/vocalist David St. Hubbins (Michael McKean), guitarist/vocalist Nigel Tufnel (Christopher Guest) and bassist Derek Smalls (Harry Shearer), the Tap is ready to embark on what will surely be a hugely successful tour in support of their new album. <br /> <br />Alas, a variety of dastardly forces unite to ruin Spinal Tap's big tour, from meddling record execs to politically correct organizations to women who, well, are just frightened of the band because they have armadillos in their trousers. Infighting within the band, a mysterious Yoko Ono-esque character, and the band's inability to make it from the dressing room to the stage without getting lost don't help the cause, either. Can the band overcome hardship and rekindle their former glory, or will they be stuck playing barmitzvahs? <br /> <br />Despite a lean running time of 82 minutes, This Is Spinal Tap manages to lampoon an impressive number of rock and metal cliches. The result is a plethora of classic scenes and one-liners, such as when Spinal Tap's guitarist shows off his amps to director Marty DiBergi, and brags about how it's so loud it \\"goes to 11.\\" When DiBergi asks why he just doesn't make 10 louder, the guitarist looks puzzled for a moment before offering his deadpan response: \\"This one goes to 11.\\" <br /> <br />The film is also filled with live performances of such Spinal Tap classics as \\"Big Bottom,\\" \\"Hell Hole,\\" and \\"Sex Farm.\\" Each is as hilarious as its title would suggest and does a great job of skewering the big dumb sex mentality of many hard rock bands. <br /> <br />Despite its greatness, \\"This Is Spinal Tap\\" does suffer a bit from the fact that it pre-dated the heyday of the hair metal explosion, which could have lent itself to some more good gags that seem to be missing from the film. And some of the jokes here have copied so many times they probably don't seem as fresh as they did more than 20 years ago. But considering, for example,that Spinal Tap's \\"black\\" album pre-dated Metallica's by seven years, it's hard to complain too much. <br /> <br />\\"This Is Spinal Tap\\" rewards repeat viewings, as it delivers as much subtle humor as in-your-face laughs. Keep an eye out for cameos by stars such as Billy Crystal, Bruno Kirby and Dana Carvey. The Special Edition DVD, boasting a hilarious intro, incredibly funny commentary track, and hours of solid deleted scenes, is a must-watch. Whether you're a rock or heavy metal fan -- or even if you hate these genres -- you'll get a kick out of \\"This Is Spinal Tap.\\"
0743298020|4.0|First, to be clear -- I really enjoyed this book. It's a book for people who love books, and stories, and authors. It's beautifully written, and several plot twists truly surprised me. My one disappointment was that all the echoes of previous classics, the similarities between Vida's story and \\"Wuthering Heights\\" and \\"Jane Eyre\\" and so many others, were left unexplained. They seemed so obvious to me, especially the echoes of \\"Wuthering Heights,\\" that I assumed there would be a REASON for these similarities--that Vida was timeless, that she was making this up based on classics, something--and... there was not. But beyond that? Very good!
B00008PW2D|3.0|Okay, I don't know what everyone else is talking about, but season 5 really isn't that horrible. I certainly wouldn't pay full price for it, but its worth buying it used for like 10-18 bucks.
B000OCXMAE|4.0|I did not like Meteroa either when it first came out but that album grew on me just like this one is starting to.  They certainly have mellowed out but they are not exactly VH1 material yet either.  The last few tracks are weak but the first eight are all pretty good.  It's a combo of rockers and ballads, just like later years Metallica or Van Halen.<br /><br />I can imagine all the fans that are calling them sissies now but it is not entirely a suprise to hear this band expand from their base.  I am happy with having this album in my collection.<br /><br />\\"Leave Out All The Rest\\" will be a big hit sometime this summer.  \\"What I've Done\\" starts out a little too much like the theme from Halloween but it has a nice melody.  \\"No More Sorrow\\" is a mid-tempo head banger.  Bleed it Out has a U2-like riff with a Shinoda rap on top of it.  Shadow of the Day has the best chorus on the album \\"and the sun will set for you\\".  Looking forward to see how these tracks play out in concert.
B00005JPKE|4.0|This, together with \\"Flags\\", tries to capture the war experience of two civilizations that rarely overlapped. Except in the basic humanity of most of the indiviual soldiers in the midst of the madness. Well done.
B000OCXFCO|1.0|Let me preface this review by saying that I grew up on Megadeth. It's sad really, what the band has become. I've watched the Argentina videos and one thought kept creeping into my head... Megadeth is now a glorified cover band. Yes, the have the lead singer. But all of the best songs they ever wrote were either with the Mustaine/Ellefson/Friedman/Menza line up, or the variations of the ones that came before it- with Poland, etc. I mean I can't get over the crowd in Argentina going nuts over \\"Symphony of Destruction,\\" \\"Hanger 18,\\" and \\"Holy Wars\\" when only Mustaine had anything to do with those songs.<br /><br />The new album itself sets itself up to fail by sticking to the over-the-top politcal themes and ideas. It's essentially a concept album with a few unrelated songs tossed in. This is not Megadeth. Looking back on everything, \\"Rust in Peace\\" was their apex and \\"Countdown to Extinction\\" was more commercial, but tolerable (there's an ironic parallel between this and Metallica's \\"Master of Puppets\\" and \\"And Justice For All\\" right before The Black Album).<br /><br />Where have you gone, Marty? I totally agree with the last review- if you want Megadeth to hand your _________ to  you, pick up \\"Rust in Peace.\\"
0385340559|4.0|Each book puts Reacher in a different role. Soldier, prisoner, detective, secret service, etc. The man is the constant. Here he is an avenger and at the top of his game. Some of the books disappointed. This does not. This may be the best of all. It kept me up late to finish. My only gripe, they could have gotten paid better.
B000OCXMAE|4.0|After reading some of the reviews on this site (prior to purchasing), I was disheartened about Minutes to Midnight. I was a huge fan of the last two Linkin Park CDs and excited about this new release. But I went ahead and bought MtM anyway.  <br /> <br />No, this CD doesn't sound like Hybrid Theory or Meteora (which are rather formulaic - and yes, even though I love both of these albums, I can admit that) - and personally, I wouldn't want it to. I get bored with repetition. Most of my favorite bands sound very different on each CD. I like a willingness to explore, a push for growth, and  experimentation in my bands. And I think that is what Linkin Park is attempting with MtM. So yes, some of the songs are a far cry from the last two CDs - but these tracks are also the ones I like the most. And even though MtM IS different, it STILL sounds like Linkin Park to me. THAT I think is a true testament to the strength of a band. <br /> <br />MtM is a more mature, broader effort on the part of Linkin Park, and I like the album more each time I listen to it. I could have done without the proselytizing on tracks 7 and 8, but that is really my only complaint about the CD.   <br /> <br />Before I heard MtM, I wasn't curious about what Linkin Park had to offer - I thought I knew their formula. After listening to this new album, I'm excited to hear what might come from this band in the future.
B000008HZB|5.0|I must admit up front to being an enthusiast of Jeff Lynne's work ever since the first strains of Electric Light Orchestra's \\"New World Record\\" began to be heard on American FM radios. I owned all of the original ELO albums, and began to recollect them as CDs when as an aging adult, I particularly missed hearing the music. Somewhere along the way I came across \\"Armchair Theatre\\" and had to give it a try.    What a treat! \\"Armchair Theatre\\" is a banquet. It includes a smoking cover of Jesse Stone's \\"Don't Let Go\\" (made famous by Jerry Lee Lewis in 1965), and two \\"standards\\" -- Koehler and Arlen's \\"Stormy Weather\\" and Weil and Anderson's 1938 \\"September Song\\" --poignantly rendered here by Lynn singing lead vocal.    There are also seven original compositions by Lynne (not released on prior ELO albums in case you are wondering) and one by Lynne and Tom Petty. Lynne's performance in \\"Don't Say Goodbye\\" recalls the otherworldly haunting clarity of the late Roy Orbison, with guitar riffs that recall George Harrison (except that Harrison adds slide guitar and vocal backup to other tracks but NOT to this one). The usual last of the ELO support crew (Tandy, Mathiesen) are in on the performance with crisp drums and background melodies.    There is no worry that the ELO sound is missing. \\"What Would it Take?\\" \\"Every Little Thing\\" and \\"Lift Me Up\\" are delivered in classic Electric Light Orchestra style and will particularly please ELO enthusiasts who rate \\"Time\\" as one of the better \\"theme albums\\" delivered by any studio band since the Beatles threw in the towel. \\"Blown Away\\" recalls the more ambient ELO sound of earlier songs like \\"Strange Magic.\\"    The one weak spot is the closing entry \\"Save Me Now\\" -- a somewhat campy, plaintive entry lamenting the environmental degradation of our planet. The narrative feels awkward and forced. But then, maybe that was the intention, since global warming, and the concomitant effects, will likely also seem awkward and forced.
B000P7V45S|5.0|There has been much confusion over the release of these remasters so I will try to break it down for you as best I can:<br /><br />-The SACD version is available as an import. It contains the album in both stereo and 5.1 surround sound SACD. The second disc contains video material in PAL format, which means you will not be able to watch it on most DVD players because of PAL/NTSC incompatibility.<br /><br />-The domestic version from Rhino/Atlantic contains the CD in stereo. The second disc is a DVD with complete album in 5.1 Dolby Surround and DTS plus video content viewable on any domestic DVD player<br /><br />-The third version is also an import and is also SACD. It's the same as the first description but the video is in NTSC and viewable on any domestic DVD player.<br /><br />The new stereo masters for all versions are new re-mixes and are the same for all versions. The only difference is the encoding (i.e. SACD/DSD or DTS/Dolby).<br /><br />The SACD versions are imports and are more expensive. They are released through EMI since they handle the UK recordings and they support the SACD format<br /><br />The DTS/Dolby versions are released through Atlantic via Rhino. They do not support the SACD format and the domestic versions, to some, sound a little different. Since this is very subjective because everyone listens to music differently you have to figure out which one is right for you and how much are you willing to spend.<br /><br />It is my opinion that both sound about the same and since I like to save money like a majority of other people I got the domestic version of \\"A Trick Of The Tail\\" and it sounds great in both stereo and surround. The best thing about the surround sound is that the music envelops you without destroying the feel of the stereo version. \\"Entangled\\" \\"Ripples\\" and \\"Mad Man Moon\\" are well complimented by the mix.<br /><br />SACD was invented by Sony to compete with DVD-Audio, Dolby, and DTS. With SACD one has to buy a player capable of decoding SACD and you need a receiver/amp with the necessary 6 inputs and outputs from player to receiver, to speakers (DVD-Audio is similar). Most SACD's on the market are not surround so all you have to do is just plug the player into your existing system. Other SACD's are hybrids meaning that there is a layer of regular audio and the SACD information on the same discs. The downside is that most people who have surround sound systems had them before SACD or can't afford or justify the added expense of buying another system.<br /><br />Dolby 5.1 and DTS audio are sent through a fiber optic cable to the surround sound amp and is digital as opposed to the SACD/DVD-A analogue connection. It is also the standard for most `theater-in-a-box\\" surround systems and any DVD player.<br /><br />So if you already have a SACD surround set up get the SACD version. Everybody else get the domestic.puts and outputs from player to receiver, to speakers (DVD-Audio is similar).

B000NVIXDW|5.0|It's rock. You should purchase one if you love jazz singer or get special edition call me irresponsible album with new added songs L-O-V-E.
B000OCXFCO|1.0|I'm really surprised at all of the positive reviews here for this CD. United Abominations is pretty pathetic. It's a bunch of riffs and song structures you've heard from Mustaine over and over and over, not to mention the blatant rip off riff from Iron Maiden's \\"Wasted Years\\" on Washington is Next. Tiresome political lyrics and another unecessary, boring re-do of an older Megadeth song, this time A Tout Le Monde (a horrible song to begin with). Seems he is really hard up for new material. This is a total snoozefest and very disappointing. If you wanna hear some real Megadeth, buy Rust In Peace.
B000N3ST8O|5.0|This is a great CD/DVD. I would recommend this to everyone. We went to see her in concert last weekend and were blown away.
B0000AQVCL|4.0|A drummer for people who only need a beat, some guitar to make it easy to move your feet, add a little baritone, and a right out-a-site organ, (no horns though), and Steven Tyler Aerosmith vocal inspiration, and you got pure and slick, perfect and corporate, riffed and hooked rock and roll from Aussie band, Jet. Hey, this stuff is nearly perfect. Who said rock is dead when infectious drum beat meets thumping bass, and guitar adds some electric twang, and you expect to hear Golden Earring's RADAR LOVE, or any of a number of great lead-in songs. This band has the lead-in down cold, (you know, it all started with The Supremes' YOU CAN'T HURRY LOVE), and the substance that follows isn't half bad. ROLLOVER DJ has a great head-bobbing vocal and riff, (\\"Hey Rollover DJ, got nothing to say?, mind if I play?\\") - not really the verse sang here, but it fits as good as any, and it rhymes. And sure, be above it, - boldly lean on The Beatles' SEXY SADIE, on track 4, LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE, right down to the resounding half-note piano key, half the kids listening never heard the original, and it sounds great. No, really. And I like The Strokes influence. And when was the last time you heard the blues as basis for great rock and roll on modern rock radio? Zepplin? And I LIKE the ballads. You can't have all riffs and hooks all the time. It would get monotonous. RADIO SONG, (\\"This won't be played on your radio, tonight\\"), a dreamy ballad makes absolutely no sense, and I find myself singing along to it on the second listen. That's craft. Closing track, TIMOTHY, at first seems a haunting reference to LSD explorer Timothy Leary, (\\"Timothy, we found your spaceship, ...it's the farthest you've ever flown\\"), but on repeated listens, seems much more profound, like a questioning of the very existence we live in, (\\"It's not what it seems, but it is\\"), - toke doobie, stare at the moon, and think about it. Nice melody too. And a fine rock album. All in all, I like it, I can bop my head to it, I wish I were 17 years old again, and I give it 4 stars.wish I were 17 years old again, and I give it 4 stars.
B000000OF6|5.0|This creation is one remarkable piece of history! I'm so thankful I got it, and for such a nice price you get almost 40 songs! With their incorporation of piano and Freddie Mercury's voice, and their guitarist- this thing just blows out your ears in amazement. I had heard so many of these songs on the radio, but who knew they did all of them? Bicycle Race first annoyed me with so much repitition, but with my love for bike-riding, it's become a motto for me to. Killer Queen is just WOWZERs... so sexy and loaded. And there's tons more, but I'll save those as super surpise you'll be glad you got!
B000P7V45S|5.0|I have bought the domestic and import versions of this CD and Wind and Wuthering and I suggest that you also buy the import versions even though you probably can't view the DVD.   I don't have a 5.1 system but the mix on the import versions sounds so much better.  It's more powerful and spacious than the U.S. versions.  Spend the extra bucks....it's really worth it!!!!!!!!!!!
B00006AVRK|5.0|Honestly, it seems that Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie were born just to portray Jeeves and Wooster. Not only were their casting as the title characters spot-on, the crew is amazing in capturing the look and feel of Wodehouse's 1920s and -30s. Clive Exton's adaptation from the novels are incredibly well-done, Anne Dudley's music further sets the tone perfectly, and whoever chose the music for Wooster to play deserves an award. Costuming is excellent as well, and to a point, so is casting.    The most irritating thing about the programme is that actors frequently change. Sometimes scheduling cannot be helped, but it's all right. Once you figure out who is who, the farce continues. The only steady roles are Stephen Fry as Jeeves, Hugh Laurie as Wooster, and Robert Daws as Tuppy Glossop.    Unfortunately, because television networks can be fickle, it seems that Clive Exton used up the best bits in series one and two, and took many liberties in three and four. It wasn't so bad in three, but I cringed many times in four. Still, with a few selective omissions, the overall rating exceeds five stars.    On to my title: if you can, get the UK release. The first thing you should know, is that the UK is region 2, PAL format. Even if your player is region-free, if it does not recognise PAL, you will be extremely disappointed. Luckily, it's easier and cheaper than ever to find a machine that meets these requirements, and you can set a computer's DVD drive to UK (many drives allow you a set number of times you can change a region, so be very, very careful).    I was fortunate to find the first three series of A&E's version at the local library, and was disappointed in the bland menu, lack of a play-all button, and absence of subtitles. This is not the first A&E release that irritated me (Monty Python seems to be the only programme they did right), and when the opportunity to purchase the UK Granada Ventures release popped up, I pounced on it, figuring, \\"There's no way it can be worse.\\"    I was not disappointed. Aside from the beautiful fold-out display, there is a very stylish interactive menu, a play-all button, and subtitles. Believe me, those subtitles rescued me more than once.    However, I'm not going to pretend the UK release did not have any shortcomings. The fold-out display is akin to that of \\"Scrubs\\" and the like, in that for each section there are two discs, one partly overlaid atop another. There is also an annoying anti-piracy message at the beginning of each disc (eight total), that cannot be skipped (this has been the standard with Granada Ventures, unfortunately). It's best to pop in the disc and wander off while the thing loads. Lastly, the only thing A&E did right was to name the episodes so you have some idea of what each episode is about. There are no synopses, and each episode is headed \\"Series One, Episode One\\", etc. You leap into each storyline cold, but if you write a little note or download the information and slip it into the case, it's not so bad.    Still, the Granada Ventures version is the one to have, and if the opportunity ever arises for you, I suggest you snap at it.
B000QQFKYE|5.0|This sure is a movie. It was produced and directed and stuff. There are so many actors in this movie. So neat.  <br /> <br />I don't know what else to call it, but a movie. I hope to see it some day. I sure do love movies, and that is what this is.
B000P0J0G0|5.0|OK, this is based off the UK release, so I can't give you any details on features, etc. Instead, I'll focus on the series. <br /> <br />First, if you don't already know, A Bit of Fry and Laurie is a collection of sketches divided by mock interviews with the \\"British public\\" (always Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie). At times these sketches are of characters, whilst other times they are of the stars as themselves. <br /> <br />Vox pops abound in every series of A Bit of Fry and Laurie, but there is a lack of regular, recurring characters (unless you count Fry and Laurie), unlike in Little Britain. In series one and two, there are Tony and Control of MI6, and the promotors of Uttoxeter, and the like, but if you've seen those two series, you'll understand why they were dropped from three and four. (I won't go into too much detail on one and two; I'll assume you've already seen them.) <br /> <br />Series three introduces Mr Music (Hugh Laurie) who plays out the credits as Stephen Fry mixes up a strange, often disturbing, concoction. This bit, thankfully survives in the final series. Series three also marks a spike in music sketches (even Fry contributes his bit, as frightening as it seems in \\"You, You, You\\", etc.), including the popular \\"There Ain't But One Way\\", in which Laurie plays a Johnnie Cash-like singer with his brother Oren. I don't think you'll ever see Stephen Fry in a more unsophisticated role. By and large, this is my absolute favourite series, and my friends agree. Three hours just flew by. <br /> <br />Series four is... a tad awkward. Apparently, the programme was moved from BBC2 to the more restrained BBC1 (I may be wrong on the channels), where creative control was hampered by the station. They introduced (often) unnecessary guest stars who did not do much -- most of the funny sketches were done without them. Thankfully, Mr Music and Fry's disturbing concoctions are back, and even more disturbing than before. And for you fans of Hugh Laurie, he does a musicsketch every episode, including \\"Little Girl\\" and the \\"Be Nice\\" rap. <br /> <br />All in all, this is a must for fans of Fry and Laurie, and an excellent introduction for new fans who are just discovering their comedy. <br />
B000MTPANQ|5.0|First of all, I don't generally write reviews here... but I felt a couple of the reviews here needed a counterpoint. So here goes... <br /> <br />I've never considered myself a Neil Young fan. Sure, I've always enjoyed his \\"radio hits\\" -- but never enough to prompt me to buy a Young record.  <br /> <br />So, anyhow, a coworker recently loaned me his copy of \\"Massey\\" and it absolutely blew me away. It's every bit as good as the other reviewers have confirmed... with one exception: It's certainly not just for people who are already Neil Young fans. It's that good. <br /> <br />While I don't think it would be a great starting point for someone with NO IDEA who Neil Young is, this disc is certainly accessable to anyone who's heard his big hits from this era.
B000J10ERO|5.0|Took long enoug. Anyway, this was one good movie. To be honest, if you are looking for action-packed scenes, then sadly you won't find it here.But if you're looking to see some amazing fly scenes and more of a traditonal \\"let's see how much I can lift\\" from ladies to a big giant replica of Krypton in the middle of the ocean, then this is for you. My favorite scene has to be the airplane scene in the beginning and the official \\"Return of Superman.\\" That's some crazy flying. It had me mezmorized. Great Luthor by Spacy. OK Louis no matter how pretty. Great angle with the kid although out of wedlock, breaking the Perfect like image of Supes. Definately get it. It's Superman!! I hear in the next one Singer plans to finally make Supes brawl. Can't wait.
B00005MP58|5.0|This is my all time favorite movie and this is the very best version.  Colin Firth IS Mr. Darcy.  Wonderful adaptation and very true to the book.  I have watched this so many times my children can recite some of the lines.  You won't be sorry.
B00005JNJV|5.0|It don't get no better than this. If you haven't seen it. Then You need to. If you have, you need to get this DVD. This is what Batman was meant to be. Who would have thought Batman could be ressurected after the dreadfull Batman and Robin? But it has indeed. Everything from Bruce's origin to his emergence as the Dark Knight is excellent. Although Katie Holmes role as Racheal Dawes is questionnable, this show is perfect. No perverseness, no real gore, no annoying parts, just perfect. And I must say that the ending to the movie is one of the greatest I have ever seen in a movie. \\"I'll look into it.\\" Perfect for the sequel with Joker, Two-face (allegedly) and I hear that there's also a costume change in the middle. Can't wait for '08.
B000OCXMAE|1.0|I love LP.  They have been my all time favorite band.  I was so looking forward to this new cd.  I had read that they were having problems with their record company in that they did not have the freedom to make the music they wanted to make and that is why it took so long for this new release.  Based off of what I heard on this new cd, they should have continued letting the record company tell them what kind of music to make.  I'am all for expanding your music and taking it to new heights but when your fan is based off your last two cd's and you make your third one sound like this, yeah your gonna have some very angry disappointed fans, myself included.  To me there are about 4 tracks that are somewhat good and they are just \\"somewhat good\\".  I think when you build up the fan base such as a band like Aerosmith who has been out forever and have made their money and can afford to make a cd that maybe different then what they normally put out, such as their Blues Album, then yeah.  But hey LP this is just your 3rd cd and your not quite apart of history as of yet to already be putting out a piece of S*** such as this last cd. <br /> <br />Hopefully the record company will show them the results of wanting to do their own thing and then throw them back in the studio and make them make the type of music they're fans are use to hearing.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|I caught this gem one night on cable, and I've been hooked ever since. I was already a fan of Pegg/Frost/Wright from Spaced, and thier foray into film is a triumph. Standout performances from Simon and Nick, and a terrific but all too small perfomance by Bill Nighy. The special features were excellent, similar to the ones on their Spaced sets (Outtakes, Homage-O-Meters, etc) My favs would have to be Funky Pete and The Man Who Would Be Shaun. Great film, wonderful extras, excellent buy! Buy it for yourself or that special pickle in your life.
B000MM0L4Q|5.0|This album is stellar. It's tbe best album ever. It's not the best album ever...it was the best album of 1975. It was the best album of 1975 that wasn't Black Sabbath's Sabotage. It's at least on par with '75 alumns Led Zaeppelin (Physical Graffiti), Neil Young (Tonight's the Night, recorded 2 years earlier), and Bob Dylan (Blood on the Tracks). It's definitely better than Patti Smith's Horses (which i think is overrated). It was easily the most credible thing that John Lennon was involved with that was released in 1975, counting his album Rock N' Roll and his son Sean (who, despite releasing an album that I really liked last year, isn't as awesome as Young Americans). If nothing else, Young Americans was the COOLEST album to be released in 1975 and probably ever. It has a self-awareness of being somewhat fake and in doing so is actually really heartfelt and sincere. The songwriting is great (times great), but its presence is unprecedented. If I had to take only one album with me to outer space, it'd probably be Black Sabbath's Sabotage. If I somehow lost all my copies of it, I'd take Young Americans. It'd probably make more sense there, being an album about alienation and the need for love in a foreign and hostile environment, in a setting that you've never expressed yourself in before and perhaps one you would not be able to express yourself in at all. It's not even my favorite Bowie album. Station to Station is. But if I have to go to space, Young Americans is coming with me...after Sabotage.
B00006AW2J|5.0|I like the singles from the stones yet I never bought any stones music until I hear Beggers Banquet. I was 18 years old and blown away by the album. I became a big fan after that.
B000031XCR|4.0|The cd looks brand new, but during shipping, a piece of the cover broke off, but that's okay the cd itself remains unaffected. Thanks, the songs are some of my favorite.
B00006AW2G|5.0|Led It Bleed is the follow up to Beggers Banquet and its just as good if not better than Beggers Banquest with its country, blues, and rock music.
B000NVIGC0|3.0|Where did Wilco go? Where did Jeff Tweedy go? Nowhere I reckon,..as I sit disappointingly listening to Sky Blue Sky. Man,..I loved EVERYTING from A.M through Yankee Hotel Foxtrot.. Where did Jeff's voice go? LONG GONE is the raspy Americana baritone of Uncle Tupelo and early Wilco. It has been replaced by a &#34;reedy/nasally&#34; impersonation of John Lennon era 1967-1973 perfoming White Album throw-aways. It has also been accompanied by someone who feels the insatiable urge to drag out overly long guitar solos way too often (noisy does not necessarily EQUAL good).  Frankly,..it sounds a bit like 70's soft-rock B-sides at times (with some over zealous guitar work on top). I don't know..maybe it will grow on me. I guess I  can't be TOO bitter, though. I've got tons of old material to keep me happy. &#34;Jesus, ETC.&#34; is playing on my iTunes right now....it's one of my TOP FIVE favorite songs.........Jeff Tweedy.....where are you?
0783231032|1.0|This was in the cheap bin at Wal-Mart, so I thought I'd give it a chance, seeing as how it 'featured' Dan Akroyd and John Belushi directed by Steven Spielberg.  Towards the end of the movie, I found myself crying out for the pain to end.  Most of the humor lies in the ridiculous slapstick category, which would make it a great children's movie if not for the constant sexual references (honestly, the funniest joke was the innuendo about the B-17).  My only hope is that you see this review while trying to decide if you should purchase the DVD, and it makes you decide not to buy it.  Epic Failure in the truest sense of the term.
6304458304|4.0|Eastwood plays Horrigan a veteran secret service agent, who is trying to stop an ex-cia hitman from killing the President.<br /><br />John Malkovich plays the assassin and steals the film from Eastwood (and believe me Eastwood is very good).<br /><br />There are a number of brilliant scenes where Eastwood and Malkovich talk over the phone, playing games of cat and mouse with each other. Credit for these must go to the screenplay by Jeff Maguire, but Wolfgang Peterson's direction is very good as well.<br /><br />This film will grab you from the first scene to the last and certainly holds up well for repeated viewings. Very entertaining indeed!
B000OCXMAE|5.0|In fact, if you have actually LISTENED to the whole thing, you'd see that it's quite good. <br /> <br />Let's be clear about one thing, okay? This is not the same Linkin Park who wrote \\"One Step Closer\\" (a great song in its own right) back in 2000. No longer are these guys screaming \\"shut up when I'm talking to you!!!\\" while playing all power chords on the guitar. To listeners, this can be a good or a bad thing; good to those who expect to see a little change and growth over the years, bad to those who enjoy hearing the same music and lyrics over and over again. Those of you looking for \\"Hybrid Theory Part II\\" or \\"Meteora the Second\\" will be very disappointed here. I'll admit, I love LP's first two major releases and still listen to them on a regular basis. But \\"Minutes to Midnight\\" is a horse of an entirely different color. <br /> <br />Gone are the days of seamless interplay between Chester's clean and/or screamed vocals and Mike's raps in each song. As others before me have said, Chester handles about 80% of the vocal duties on this album. But is that really such a bad thing? The man has a phenomenal voice! Sure, the scratching effects of one Mr. Hahn are almost absent here, but his presence can still be felt in the other electronic sounds pervasive throughout the album. What really impresses me, however, is how much the other three members of the band have stepped it up in regards to their instruments. Guitarist Brad Delson, for the most part, ditches the all-power chord playing that characterized LP's first 2 albums in favor of something more clean and textured, and he even plays a couple solos! The power behind Rob Bourdon's drumming has intensified, particularly evident on \\"No More Sorrow.\\" And bassist Phoenix? You can actually HEAR the man playing this time, most clearly on \\"Given Up.\\" <br /> <br />Now I'll admit, I was rather disappointed at first when I heard the two \\"political\\" songs on this album, \\"Hands Held High\\" and \\"No More Sorrow,\\" both of which clearly are pointed jabs at the Bush administration. The reason for my disappointment is that Linkin Park has made such great music in the past without having to resort to politics, so why start now? I'm no fan of Bush or the Iraq war, but I see no need for musicians to bring their views into their songs. (I know many of you will disagree with me, and that's fine, but keep your thoughts to yourself. You aren't winning The Battle for the Internets by posting comments on my review.) That being said, these guys have done this a lot better than most other artists recently have, i.e. The Dixie Chicks and Green Day. LP's political songs actually have a little thing called \\"emotion\\" behind them, and they don't sound whiny or forced. (See \\"Not Ready to Make Nice\\" or \\"American Idiot\\" for examples of this.) Furthermore, yes, the F-bomb is utilized on three songs on this release (\\"Given Up,\\" \\"Bleed It Out,\\" \\"Hands Held High\\"), and while I am shocked by that it fails to detract from the overall quality of the songs. <br /> <br />I'm now going to delve into a track-by-track review of the album: <br />1) \\"Wake\\"-Just a short instrumental intro, barely a minute long. Perfectly sets the 50/50 \\"beautiful\\" and \\"brutal\\" tone of the album. <br />2) \\"Given Up\\"-Linkin Park gone punk rock? No way, it can't work! But it does, and Chester's voice is in top form here. The hand claps and jingling keys are unique background sounds, and Phoenix's bass playing is killer. Also marks the first apperance of the F-bomb on the album. <br />3) \\"Leave Out All The Rest\\"-The first real \\"ballad\\" on \\"Minutes to Midnight,\\" but it's a great one. Chester sings this one beautifully and the lyrics are quite meaningful. <br />4) \\"Bleed It Out\\"-Far and away the most fun song on the album to listen to. This is Mike's first appearance and he does not disappoint. He proves that he is more talented than about 95% of mainstream rappers today. Second track with the F-bomb. <br />5) \\"Shadow of the Day\\"-A lot of folks have compared this to the U2 hit \\"With or Without You,\\" and I can see why. Was the band channeling Bono and Company while writing/recording this one? Who knows, but it sounds good to me. <br />6) \\"What I've Done\\"-The album's first single that you've no doubt heard countless times on your local radio station(s). Excellent choice for a single, but I personally would have picked \\"Bleed It Out.\\" <br />7) \\"Hands Held High\\"-This track is all Mike. Very reminiscent of his Fort Minor side project, but you can still tell it's LP. I'd love to hear this one at a live show. <br />8) \\"No More Sorrow\\"-Chester's turn to get political on us, and boy does he sound angry. And as a couple others have said, this song wouldn't sound out of place on a Metallica release. Rob's drumming is extraordinary here. <br />9) \\"Valentine's Day\\"-Probably the most \\"emo\\" song on the album, but LP aren't trying to sound like Dashboard Confessional. And thank God for that. Starts out slow but picks up toward the end. <br />10) \\"In Between\\"-Hold on, Mike can sing? Who knew? This is probably the slowest and most simple song on the album, but that doesn't make it bad by any means.  <br />11) \\"In Pieces\\"-This might sound like an odd comparison, but this track reminds me a lot of the song \\"37 mm\\" from AFI's newest release \\"Decemberunderground.\\" More on my proposed Linkin Park-AFI connection a bit later. <br />12) \\"The Little Things Give You Away\\"-Honestly, I cried the first time I heard this song. It's that beautiful, and the perfect closer. I never thought LP had it in them to write a song about Hurricane Katrina, but it works. <br /> <br />Okay, now onto why I'm suggesting that Linkin Park and A Fire Inside (AFI) are similar. To be sure, they are two very different sounding bands, but they both took critical risks with recent releases that appear to have \\"alienated\\" many of their \\"hardcore fans.\\" AFI did it in 2003 with \\"Sing The Sorrow\\" and even more so with 2006's \\"Decemberunderground.\\" These two albums were so dramatically different from anything they've done previously that much of their \\"fanbase\\" wrote them off as \\"sell-outs\\" because they all wanted \\"The Art of Drowning Part Deux.\\" It is evident to me that the same thing is happening here with Linkin Park. \\"Minutes to Midnight\\" is unmistakeably different from any previous LP release, and it shows real growth and promise, but apparently there are still a ton of folks out there who are stuck in the year 2000 and are waiting for another song like \\"Crawling\\" or \\"Runaway\\" to come out of LP's repertoire. Their loss I suppose.
0131479415|3.0|It's a nice book on the topic but definitely not a must-read. Cohn has good tips and general advices but the book focus lots more on planning than estimating.

He falters when trying to sum up whole fields, like economics, or makes generalizations about all the social sciences or hard sciences.   <br /> <br />I enjoy this book for its observations and erudition, and even more so its original thought.  On the other hand, the content is at times a little self-indulgent.  So I am grateful I can take in its contents in book form rather than having to receive the large ego of the author in person.
B000H7JD4K|5.0|In their second life, after the return of Bruce Dickenson and Adrian Smith, Iron Maiden continues to prove that they are one of the most solid acts in metal by releasing another great album.  \\"Life And Death\\" is a concept album based around soldiers in war.  Not exactly a new subject for Maiden, but they have never really put a whole album together on the subject before.  Maiden again moves into progressive metal territory on several of the tracks and overall feature a more \\"mature\\" (for lack of a better word) sound.  This is not a turn off however as there is still plenty of patented Maiden fire and spit to be found as well.  The single from the album \\"The Reincarnation Of Benjamin Breeg\\" is one of the more unique songs the band has done.  The album is chock full of epics with \\"Brighter Than A Thousand Suns\\", \\"The Longest Day\\", \\"For The Greater Good Of God\\", \\"Lord Of The Light\\" and \\"The Legacy\\" all clocking in the 7 to 10 minute range.  The shorter songs here are all good too.  The three guitar attack of Murray, Gers, and Peterson are at the top of their game, and Dickenson has lost nothing in the vocal department over the years.  It is really great to see this veteran band putting out some of the best music of their almost 30 year career.  If you are a fan of Iron Maiden this album is essential.  If you have ever looked to get into them and like metal / prog metal this would be a good place to start.  Up the irons!
B000NDIAWY|5.0|Every song on this album is so good.  Brandi's voice is beautiful. The guitar work is simple.  The songs are strong and don't need much help. Great harmonies and masterful production from one of the best, T-Bone Burnett.  You must buy this CD.

B000GPI2EK|5.0|Mastodon is the rarest kind of metal band -- a really brilliant, creative one. No posing or nu-metal appeals for radioplay here.<br /><br />And after their previous brilliant albums, they reached a new apex in \\"Blood Mountain.\\" The Atlanta band spins songs about a beautiful, icy land -- played in a sonic eruption of kinetic instruments and some brilliantly mythic lyrics. It's a fiery, breathtaking ride.<br /><br />It opens with rapid-fire drums and a squealing guitar, with a hoarse voice shouting, \\"The hero of the gods/The crossing of the threshold!\\" But the music soon uncoils into a fast-moving hard-rocker, full of blistering riffs and surreal lyrics about gods, shapeshifters, tyrants, heroes and \\"hulder folk and fairies.\\"<br /><br />Then we break into the tribal drums and blazing, sludgy riffs of \\"Crystal Skull,\\" which is just begging to be air-guitared. And they don't let up in the songs that follow: the darkly epic \\"Sleeping Giant,\\" metal with nimbly catchy melodies, sludgy hard-rock that blazes with muscular basslines, and expanses of roaring prog-metal that races by at light speed.<br /><br />No ballads. No interludes. Sure, some of these songs open with some electronic squiggling, or maybe a mellow guitar melody, but they don't take long to explode into something totally different. The only exception is \\"Pendelous Skin,\\" the very last song on the album -- it's an atmospheric blend of slow-burning rock played in a more alt-rocky style.<br /><br />But up until then, it's nothing but rapid-fire, headbanging proggy-rocky metal. Sludgy and/or muscular riffs, smashing bass, and blindingly rapid drums that have to be heard to be believed -- and the whole thing is tightly woven out of different styles. And this is all to make story-songs with complex, intense melodies that can change in midsong -- from epic metal to chaos, and back again -- to reflect whatever is happening.<br /><br />And the world Mastodon is exploring in this just reeks of fantasy and old legends -- nature gods, wilderness, icy lands, skulls, tree people, ivory towers, one-eyed monsters, more skulls, and ancient elms. I have no idea what they're trying to communicate, but their songwriting is definitely atmospheric (\\"A vast calm wilderness/The call to adventure comes/Lead and land atop this rock/Infinite path carved with unrivaled skill...\\")<br /><br />Mastodon's \\"Blood \\"Mountain\\" is a  devastatingly, frighteningly mythic experience, like wandering through an ancient legend.

B000OCXMAE|5.0|Anyone who gives this cd 2 stars or below have know idea how to expand there music byond 1 or 2 types of music. OMG they changed there sound somewhat, who cares, its good music, and it shows us that they can do something more than just what was on the last 2 cd's. So give this CD a chance and don't read into much of the reviews that just cry about how its not like there last 2 cd's. <br /> <br />Thank you.
B000021XS0|5.0|In my opinion, this is Dream Theater's best album. That doesn't mean that I don't appreciate some of the genius work on Images and Words and Awake, it just means that, as an entire album, this one is slightly better. Images and Words as well as Awake have some of the best Dream Theater songs (Learning To Live, Metropolis Pt. 1, Caught In A Web, Scarred) to date, but Scenes From A Memory is more cohesive from beginning to end.  <br /> <br />This release is Dream Theater's first attempt at a concept album. Whether or not you enjoy concept albums is irrelevant because each song can stand on it's own without the knowledge that the entire album follows one main storyline. Each song is very unique without straying too far from the Dream Theater formula that made them what they are. Highlights for me are Home, Fatal Tragedy, The Spirit Carries On, and Finally Free. As always, the musicianship is phenomenal without being too self indulgent as DT can sometimes be. The song structures are complex, but not so much as to take away from the overall atmosphere of each song. <br /> <br />This is also the first album with current (as I'm writing this) keyboardist Jordan Rudess. Jordan is obviously very talented and adds a new element to the band that wasn't there in previous albums. Not a better element, just a new element. I believe Kevin Moore was better at creating melodies than Jordan, but I believe Jordan is better during the interlude and fill sections. Six of one, half dozen of the other I guess. <br /> <br />I own every Dream Theater album to date and SFAM still gets the most play in my stereo, closely followed by Images and Words and Awake. I enjoy all of the albums since SFAM, but I don't think they have since captured the same magic and probably never will again.  <br /> <br />As with every review, these are my opinions and I'm sure many people will disagree with me, but that's what makes these reviews so much fun. Enjoy! <br />
B000062XFG|4.0|I have been a Trekkie most of my life, but I had to say that I was somewhat disappointed with the first TNG season.  It seemed too slow, almost tedious at times.  It almost suprises me that there was a second season, but I'm glad that there was.  The second season is a definate improvement.  I have nothing against Dr. Crusher, but I do like Dr. Pulaski much better.  Another thing in its favour is the character developments in the second season.  I like getting to know the characters better and seeing what they do with their lives, rather than just the wonders the ship has to offer.  Probably the best episodes in this season, in my humble opinion, were Manhunt, Elementary, Dear Data, The Child, and Up the Long Ladder.  Definately worth the watch.
B000OCXMAE|1.0|I am a huge Linkin Park fan. I practically memorized their old cds i like them that much, which is why Minutes to Midnight is such a disappointment. Gone is the hard rocking-rock/rap that I loved and what made them famous and in its place is a cd of poorly done balads. Chester & Mike DONT SHARE ANY TRACKS. No tracks with an awesome rap beat mixed with a hardcore rock song, its not there at all, its really terrible. This cd is so terrible that after listening to it once I may never listen to it again and just hope that they come out with something better in a couple years. Then again they could put out an album of dogs barking to a rock/rap beat and it would be better then this piece of garbage. I never write reviews for music but I felt obligated for this one. If you are a Linkin Park fan, DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM. Just pretend that they never put out a new album and wait patiently for them to come to their senses.
B000002L1L|3.0|As some say this isn't the same archivement with the dp mk2 lineup as \\"Perfect Strangers\\", but the spirit remains the same with the opening title \\"battle rages on\\" with hard pounding rock and synths.<br /><br />With exception of the tracks \\"battle rages on\\" and \\"Anya\\" the album is good solid rock, but not hard. I enjoy this album as much as the other stuff with the dp mk 2 lineup, and that's why I purchased the album. I must admit I have not followed DP since this album, with exception of the title track from their 2005 album \\"Rapture of the deep\\". It's not the same without Jon Lord and Ritchie Blackmore...But they still know how to shake the very foundations of rock 'n' roll and with style and experince. Long live Deep purple and their Fans:-)
B00005JLCI|2.0|I know I'm going to catch hell for this review, but I've tried to watch Branagh's Hamlet twice and quit half way through both times.  This is not meant pejoratively, but Branagh's Hamlet is an assault on the senses.  He brays and he mews and he mugs for the camera.  Where are the grace notes?  How can the Dane be such an unsympathetic character?  Winslet's Ophelia is a raving hysteric, Polonius a caricature of a hypocrite, Lemmon woefully miscast, his line readings leaden.  The soundtrack, always intrusive, at time overwhelms the dialogue.  Bigger is not necessarily better.  Give me Olivier, even Gibson, any day.

B00005JPKE|1.0|I had always liked Clint Eastwood, both as an actor, then as a director. However his latest release, \\"Letters From Iwo Jima\\", with all the hype, television commercials and advertisements, with it's, \\"4 Academy Award Nominations\\", leaves a lot to be desired!     All those television commercials don't tell you that the movie is only available in Japanese, with optional English subtitles! For a movie marketed in the United States, no matter how `historically correct' it may or may not be, should be available in `English'!    Granted, some movies are meant to tell a story. But movies, whether fiction, non-fiction, action, drama, comedy, sci-fi, what-ever, are also to `entertain'. Sure, those movies that `may be' historically correct may teach correct events in history, however is the best way to do that is by reading subtitles on a television?    I mean, if I wanted to know any specifics about Iwo Jima, I'm sure I can find dozens of books I can read on that subject! I don't want to read subtitles on my television!    Even trying to view this movie, the subtitles that `pop up', doesn't stay there long enough to even read them.     Not unlike \\"Flags of Our Fathers\\", (which I was also extremely disappointed with as a movie), and which was offered along with this movie in a special two-pack edition, I fell asleep trying to watch both of these movies.    Sorry Clint, I know Japanese back in World War II, didn't speak English, but if you want to hold an audience, you have to do it in a language they can understand. Okay, throw in an `accent' in there to make it more real, if you need to, but `GEE' weren't lessons learned from Mel Gibson's \\"Passion of the Christ\\" when that came out in a `non-English' version?    I'm sure this movie will do well in Japan, and in Japanese communities in the United States, but that is not where the biggest market is going to be! I don't want to `read' movies!    Educate me if you desire, take my money and entertain me, but do it in English!
B000GYI32M|4.0|Still good dish and guilty pleasure.  I'm not much of a TV watcher, but got hooked on this show at the recommendation of a friend.  I thought from the name that it was just another cheesy show about pretty people and realized it was much more than that.  This one actually has depth.  Each season is less than stellar compared to the previous season and season three is no different, but it's still got a strong enough hook to reel you in.<br /><br />I was happy to see Kirsten and Sandy the main O.C. parents level back out and become that strong power couple again the way they were in Season 1.  The shows writers had made them rocky on Season 2 which seemed completely out of character for them.  Julie Cooper heads down a financial decline which you wouldn't have minded to watch in Season 1 when she deserved it, but by Season 3 she had become so likable it wasn't that pleasant to endure.  It started off sad, but they soon made it comedic.  As for the kids story lines, I could tell it was getting a little tired as the writers stretched to create ridiculous drama that would never happen in real life.<br /><br />You know it's lazy writing when you have characters showing up at the wrong place at the wrong time to hear or witness something they shouldn't.  Because that never happens in real life.  They introduced a meddling Dean at the High School that seemed forced to the point where they had him targeting the lead cast members to make their lives miserable.  Yeah that happens right?<br /><br />The Ryan and Marissa relationship seems to continue despite them both constantly getting the wrong idea of what the other is up to.  It doesn't help that Marissa latches onto every helpless boy she comes across to the point that it almost seems inappropriate if you're involved with someone else.  That boy is Johnny the surfer friend who develops a crush on Marissa.  That got tired real fast.  I don't know what the writers were thinking by dragging this Johnny character I'm one episode after another.  He overstayed his welcome after the second episode he was in.  Everytime you turned around he was showing up at someone's door feeling melodramatic and persistently sad that he can't have Marissa.<br /><br />Caleb's departure was oddly missed as well too.  Jimmy Cooper surfaces in the beginning, but is quickly or conveniently written out again as they drag his financial troubled storyline.  Kirsten's miraculous turnaround after rehab was welcomed and nice to see the Cohen's strong and going again.<br /><br />The High School scenes with the kids was getting exhausting by this season.  Especially since I couldn't figure out why they were all still in High School.  I figured them for seniors in season 1.  Maybe that's because the actors playing the kids were well into their twenties and pushing nearly 30 by the time season 4 rolled around.  It was great to see a bit more of Summers Dad as we know all about the other lead kids parents.  Although what was odd is Marissa is staying at Summers house but sleeping in the same bed as her.  They're fighting over using the same mirror?  What is odd about that is its not like they don't have any other room in that house.  Summer lives in a mansion.<br /><br />Despite the criticisms I still loved the show and this season, but the tiredness of dragging the forced drama and storylines was becoming more apparent in this season.  The writing was sloppy and the dialogue had become mundane.  It's not surprising that the show ended abruptly in season 4.  Most know the Marissa character played by Mischa Barton makes her radical exit at the end of season 3 through death. It was Mischa's decision to leave the O.C. to pursue a movie career which never came to light.  She should've stayed on the O.C. and milked it since that's when her popularity started and peaked all in one show.  Her character's death was unnecessary.  They really wanted to make sure she didn't come back.  She was already going to go sailing with her dadfor a year.  The writers should've left that alone and keep the door open for the fans.  When you kill off a lead character in a show like this, you're literally killing the show itself, which is what happened in Season 4 where the ratings dropped astronomically prompting to cancel the show eight episodes short.the door open for the fans.

B000002H38|5.0|This is simply one of those recordings that is a must have for those who love first class, essential, Rhythm & Blues done by a gifted vocalist with a first class voice.  She has that combination of range, power and knows when and how to use it.       Not to make you think that she is a jazz vocalist or  that this is a jazz recording, which it is not, but the most obvious comparison I can make in richness of voice, power of delivery  and inventive phrase, would be Sarah Vaughan.   Trust me that is BIG company.  That is a very good thing.   Vocalists like that come along every few decades.     Most importantly she has the soul and heart of a true romantic.  These songs just go straight to the heart of you.   No vocal acrobatics at the expense of the song or the intended sentiment.  When she belts it out, it is at the moment in which the intensity is necessary.        Most of these pieces are ballads and all are love songs but they are delivered with sophistication, sensuality, sincerity and power.      When I first heard this and then saw her perform this, she held me transfixed.     The poignancy of \\"No One In The Word\\", \\"Rapture\\", \\"Sweet Love\\", \\"Mystery\\" and \\"You Bring Me Joy\\" amidst good solid instrumentation, make these five pieces true high points and memorable R&B.   The pieces have something that is often lost these days. That ability to shift to accentuate a point of mood and then back again.        There is a lithe sensuality throughout this recording that is missing from much of the so called quiet storm recordings where romance is lost for the schmaltz or sexuality.       There is a a balance.  Throughout Anita delivers with as fine a voice as I've heard before or since.  She has a beautiful rich voice.  Round tones and an impressive range.  When she belts it out she does so in context and not as a means on to itself.        More people should know of this recording.     Anita Baker is one of a kind and if you get just one Anita Baker recording, get this one, you won't be sorry.
B00006CXSS|5.0|If you're a person who's not too keen on reading about history - but who likes movies or documentaries about it, this is a series of DVDs for you. It traces the involvement of Easy Company during the entire course of WWII - bootcamp, staging in England, D-Day, their campaigns they fought in.<br /><br />In doing so, there is not one single weak performance given by the sterling cast of 1st Line, 2nd Line and character actors. Gritty, unflinching, and dogged in its portrayal of the WWII experience by American GI's, this series loses the sugarcoating found in many war movies. There's no romanticism here.<br /><br />If you want to understand why so many WWII veterans hate war in any form but the absolute most necessary form, watch these images and try to feel what these simple, ordinary American men felt.<br /><br />At the end, you may have a slightly different take on Veteran's Day.
B00005ND42|5.0|Years ago I was dating a classical musician and listening to a lot of classical, romantic, and modernist music.  This is one I discovered while listening to my school's in-house cd player.  One of the secretaries had put this on and I had the pleasure of listening to these pieces for hours a day.  These two individuals play what is for me the definitive Beethoven.  It may have been recorded more than forty years ago but the sound is warm and wonderful. reminding one that Beethoven was essentially writings duets, not sonatas, and the interplay between the two is joyous, complex, and densely shadowed as only a composer of Beethoven's timbre could be.

I suspect I'll be developing my own meanings for some of these cards, but I like to personalize that way, anyway.<br /><br />The tarot bag that comes with the set is kind of cheap & cheesy. Mine came with some beads already off & the material is pretty see-through, but I won't need the bag, fortunately. Also, the top card in my deck came \\"marked\\" with a rectangular indentation on one side (obviously created in the manufacturing or packaging process,) although I hardly consider it worth worrying much about.<br /><br />The pronunciations for Welsh words included in the book were not quite right, however. The Welsh letter \\"ll,\\" for example, does NOT sound like \\"tl,\\" as suggested. There IS no equivalent sound in English, so using English letters to approximate it will never work right.

B000EMGAOY|3.0|This is what I recommend;     1. Burn the following songs from \\"Stadium Arcadium\\" onto a single CD in this order:    1) Make you feel better  2) Dani California  3) Torture Me  4) Charlie  5) Strip My Mind  6) Hey  7) Animal Bar  8) Tell Me Baby  9) Turn It Again  10) If  11) Death Of A Martian  12) Hard To Concentrate    2. Label the disc \\"Red Hot Chili Peppers- STARCADIUM,\\" & enjoy. Now you've got a killer album.     3. Sell or trade your double album \\"Stadium Arcadium\\"- It's made up of too many tired melodies & boring-after-the-second-listen songs that interrupt the overall flow.      To my knowledge, since the music industry began, bands have, for the most part, understood that not every single thing they write is brilliant & the-world's-gotta-hear-it!  This is why, when you read interviews with Name Your Band, they generally say something along the lines of \\"Well, we had twenty eight songs, but during the recording & mixing process we decided these ten songs were the strongest so we dropped the others.\\"  That's how classic albums have come to be throughout the decades.  I agree, there are a few exceptions, double albums that are impressive through & through, but they're rare and this is not one of them.      Nor was Guns & Roses' \\"Use Your Illusions I & II\\" or System Of A Downs' \\"Mezmerize\\" & \\"Hypnotize\\" records.  But again, in both those cases also, take away the weaker material, the 'Everything We Do Is Brilliant Now!' or 'We could make twice as much $$ this time!' and you've got solid single albums.      My System Of A Down mix, combining tracks from \\"Mezmerize\\" & \\"Hypnotize\\" is: 1.)Attack  2.)Tentative  3.)This Cocaine Makes Me Feel Like I'm On This Song  4.)U-Fig  5.)Revenga  6.)Vicinity Of Obscenity  7.)Kill Rock Roll  8.)Question!  9.) Stealing Society  10.)Soldier Side-Intro  11.)B.Y.O.B  12.)  Lost In Hollywood  Guarantee you'll find it more interesting than either of those records on their own.  My belief is you should walk away wanting more, not stopping it halfway through going \\"I've had enough.\\"  By the way, burn cds at slower speeds to ensure that your player can read them & quality is up to snuff.
B000O5AYCA|5.0|One of this year's greatest. \\"Mistaken for strangers\\" is the instant killer, the rest of the album grows slowly on you as long as you keep listening to it, and you can't stop. As big as Interpol or Trail of Dead. A masterpiece.
B000NVIXDW|5.0|I think this is a fabulous CD....I love the \\"rat pack\\" feel of it and Michael's tone.  AWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME
B000002U6E|5.0|one of there best highly recomend it to anyone who likes there music.
B000MZHW40|5.0|Initial reviews for \\"Blood Diamond\\" were luke-warm, and I avoided watching it until now, despite its 5 Oscar noms... Well, critics are wrong; they don't comment on the elements in the film that make it audience-worthy. It has action, and plenty of it. It has historical merit. And it boasts excellent performances from di Caprio, Hounsou & Jennifer Connelly, who should have been nominated, too (along with the strength of her performance in \\"Little Children\\"). I was riveted from the beginning, and am so glad I finally saw this film. Indeed, the brutality of man toward fellow man is unsettling, not unlike Edward Zwick's other films (\\"Glory\\" etc.). It also emphasizes how helpless we all are to do anything about it. Kudos to all involved.  An added note: I recall that Mr. Hounsou's performance was regarded as one-note and hysterical all the time; I  profoundly disagree. I thought he was centered and totally in touch with his character. And, was he really \\"supporting\\"...?He was quite fine.
B00005JXY3|5.0|This was the second movie in the series to be released. It was made about two year after the first movie came out in the middle 1984. For those of you that did not see the first movie there is a briefy flash back lasting about 5 to ten minutes at the beginnig showing some of the footage from the first movie. Daniel travels to Onknowa were he gets involved in a brutal feud between mr Manyagie and his rivial who trained under his sick father. Shortly after the father dies of an illness the rivial and his sons due several nasty thins to presuade MR. Mayege to fight him. Finally after threaten to sell the land and destroy all the homes he excepts to fight him at midnight. Can Mr. Maygga make peace with his old nemisis and bring honor back to the Maygga family. There is also a special collector version of albums which contains the musice for all four films. However this cd limited edition set is super, super, super, rare only two copies are avilable on Amazon used and the selling price for these two copies is about 90 to 120 dollars with the shipping fee include. If you like this I recommend you buy the collection unless you want to by them seperately one at a time. I recommend you try not to get karate kids part III and part four one disk by themselve with out one and two becaue the cheaptest you can get the last two movies with out the first 2 movies is about $40. Will Daniel save the day again and resolve the feud find out in the thrilling conclusion.
0399226907|5.0|This is a very cute book and we have other books from Mr. Carle.
0812975219|4.0|Clearly this is a brilliant (read: logical)mind at work here. I do recommend this book, not so much for how it can improve your ability to enhance your financial decision-making ability but for the fact that it illuminates the very randomness of everyday life (and how what we blithely accept as a \\"fated event\\" is simply no more than something that equally could have turned a thousand different ways).  <br /> <br />Now, if only I felt I could use in a practical sense, the words and theories that Taleb touches upon. You could be left with a feeling of helplessness by book's end, but you'll still be the wiser from the reading...
B00005JPCF|2.0|Where do I begin? From the very opening, with voice-talent Hugh Jackman sporting an absolutely AWFUL Elvis-impersonation-type voice, to the farfetched and idiotic plot, this movie was an utter disaster. <br /> <br />What is the obsession with penguins these days? Must a movie be about PENGUINS to be a box-office hit? March of the Penguins came out recently, in which I felt like I was watching the Discover channel. Now this pitiful excuse for a movie has come, and it was even WORSE! And now, a new animated penguin movie is set to come out this summer I believe. Well, I've learned my lesson, and will be sure to avoid it. <br /> <br />The ONLY reason why I gave this movie two stars was because the animation was really quite good. In fact, it was amazing. But does that make this movie OSCAR-worthy?!? I don't think so. I personally feel that Cars, a wonderful movie, was robbed of the Academy Award for Best Animated Picture. So in conclusion, please don't buy this movie. In fact, don't even rent it; Unless, like me, your curiosity in a movie about dancing penguins gets the better of you.
0312360266|5.0|I really didn't expect to like this book as much as I did. I've only recently started picking up some of the YA urban fantasy offerings, but so far Marked is my favorite. Yes, the plot is mostly follows formula. Yes, the main character is super-extra-special, but I didn't mind that at all. Usually, I'd throw a book across the room for that, but I really liked this one. I can't wait for Betrayed.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|<br />Before seeing this movie, I had no IDEA some of the things happening to our earth right now. I'm not not really going to go into the science, but Al Gore makes it very simple for you to understand the basics as well as the gravity of situation before us. <br /> <br />But it's not just a science lesson, it is also very captivating film in its own right from start to finish, with as much humor as there could be in such a serious movie. So buy this movie. Buy this movie and witness possibly the greatest problems of our time. And learn how to fix it.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|All ten seasons for this price is really a great deal.  Forget the extras and the book that comes with it.  This is about the shows, and how great it was for such a long time.  It is a little evident that they started to run out of  gas halfway through season 9 on the main stories, but the smaller \\"side-stories\\" were always fresh and hilarious. Seasons 3-8 are absolutely great.  Don't miss this while its available.
B000N6TX1I|3.0|Children of Men was advertised as an action movie. While I will grant that there was plenty of action, I felt slightly betrayed. Michael Caine is one of my favorite actors, and Clive Owen has proven himself to be quite strong as well. And while both of the gave very strong performances, I wasn't too thrilled about the direction. It lacked pacing, and in my opinion, was just sometimes downright boring. <br /> <br />Children of Men takes place in the near future, in a time when women have lost their ability to have babies. Consequently, the entire world falls apart. Sound like a stretch? Well, to me it was.  <br /> <br />However, before I become too critical of the movie, I will say that it was a very raw, very vivid film. And in some ways that's good, in other ways it isn't. For instance, at times, I just wanted them to push aside all of the \\"thought-provoking\\" ideas and get back to the movie. All in all, it was an alright movie, but I feel it didn't live up to it's potential. So I would recommend that you rent this movie, not buy it. And if you agree with many of the other reviewers on this site, maybe this the movie for you. But if not, I'd say it was still worth seeing at least once.
B00005JPAO|5.0|This movie is so true,Helen Mirren really brought home the fact that Diana's death brought the Queen into the 20th century.[[ASIN:B00005JPAO The Queen]]
B000MNP2KI|4.0|<br />I had never heard of Daniel Craig when I first heard that he was to play Bond. But when I saw his picture in the paper, I was devestated. He was blonde. Blonde Bond? I wasn't buying it. <br /> <br />I went into the movie holding my breath. I didn't know what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised to witness a tightly paced, action-packed Bond flick with- gasp -a very fine performance by Daniel Craig. The blonde hair was not an issue at all. In fact, looking back, I feel pretty foolish for thinking it would. <br /> <br />Though some of the poker got old, I guess they had to have it in there in a movie called \\"Casino Royale\\". Though I was laughing to myself as they bet millions of dollars like it was nothing. But wait- Why were they playing Texas Hold 'Em? They're betting millions of dollars in a game of Texas Hold 'Em?!? Preposterous. <br /> <br />Also, some of the sappy parts toward the end were just awful: \\"I have no armor left...\\" GAG!!! Oh well, even in those sequences Craig seemed to be giving it his all. And wow! He is ripped!!! He must have been training for this movie, because he was a beast! All in all, it was quite a good movie. I would recommend it. And I look forward to Daniel Craig in the James Bond movies to come.
B00005JPAO|5.0|Helen Mirren is amazing as the Queen in this film and all supporting actors are amazing in their portrayal of the Royal Family.  This film has such quality in both the scenery, reality, and dignity used to portray this family.........of just really 'human' beings.  I have already watched this DVD many times.
4789009637|5.0|Japanese is a very difficult language for English speakers to learn. If you've learned some French or Spanish (as I have), forget about it! Japanese is many times more difficult. That being said, Japanese is also more interesting, in that it has a completely different structure and forces you to think differently.<br /><br />Genki does a good job of presenting Japanese is an orderly fashion. The authors are all native Japanese speakers, and there are a few places where they make mistakes in English, but those small errors do not take away from the text.<br /><br />Genki could use a few more sample Japanese sentences, though. For example, when they present a new pattern, they often provide just a couple of examples when ten or twelve would be better. I suppose they assume (correctly) that this book will mostly be used in a classroom setting, and that the teacher will provide additional material.<br /><br />In the end, Genki is a good textbook, but you will need more help if you are going to learn to speak Japanese. That is not the fault of the authors, it is just the way it is.
B00006CXSS|5.0|The accolades cannot pile up high enough to overwhelm HBO's epic 10-part miniseries, \\"Band of Brothers.\\"  Based on the famous book by the late, great historian Stephen Ambrose, \\"BoB\\" sets a high-water mark for television.   <br /> <br />On a personal note, I watched this miniseries after falling in love with HBO's \\"The Sopranos\\" and watching the first four seasons of that mesmerizing series.  I have to admit that I was a little concerned about going back to the gosh-darn solidity and goodness of the Greatest Generation after being steeped in the murderous cynicism of the Soprano family for a few weeks.  How could the noble soldiers of D-Day compare to the awful, glorious humanity of America's favorite crime family?  I was prepared to slog through ten hours of bland goodness and sacrifice, spiced only by action scenes. <br /> <br />I shouldn't have worried.  Stephen Ambrose served as co-executive producer of this series, along with Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks, and other noteworthy talents.  Gifted writing and directing showed the intimate details of the life of Easy Company as it is forged in basic training and the D-Day invasion and the pounding it took in Normandy, the Battle of the Bulge, and Operation Market-Garden, up through discovering one of the first concentration camps to the taking of Hitler's famed Eagle's Nest in the Alps.  Rather than serve up a bunch of cardboard cutouts, the creative team shows a cast of soldiers full of hopes, dreams, sins, virtues, and flaws.   <br /> <br />In short, \\"BoB\\" tells the real story of real men who did amazing things during their 434 days in Europe.  Even though the action scenes are legitimately amazing (often rivalling the best scenes from \\"Saving Private Ryan,\\" if not surprassing them), the strongest elements of \\"BoB\\" are the quiet ones.  Whether showing the struggles of a man raised from the ranks to become an officer, or the pain associated with losing a beloved comrade on one of the last patrols of the war, or the fury that only comes from being ordered about by a complete cretin, \\"BoB\\" captures the essence of what it was to be a \\"grunt.\\"  Ambrose was famously a fan of Eisenhower, Marshall, and the infantryman.  That love comes through in this series in spades. <br /> <br />Spicing most of the series are interviews with actual members of Easy Company.  To watch these old soldiers recall these dark days with such humility simply stuns you into silence. <br /> <br />HBO has done an amazing thing with \\"BoB.\\"  By focusing on a company that was seemingly everywhere in the Allied advance across Europe, \\"BoB\\" tells as comprehensive a tale as can be told of our experiences over there.  This is worthy television and demands to be seen.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|The panoramic images are mesmerizing, narration enthralling and soundtrack magnificent!  I am blown away by this incredible production.  It makes you feel so small compared to our beautiful planet.
B000QGAU4E|2.0|I had wanted to see this movie when it was first released in theaters but didn't have time. Based on reviews I had read, I thought it would be a great film. After watching this movie, I am greatly dissappointed. To say that it was just boring would be too kind. It was also very depressing. I suppose some could say it's thought provoking and the acting is good, but it's still boring. If it weren't for the occasional explosion and gunshot, <br />I would have fallen asleep several times. Luckily, I only wasted 99 cents <br />on it during the special sale last weekend. Don't waste your time or money on this yawn fest.
B000P2A256|5.0|Five years is a long time for a break. In Maroon 5's case, after touring for three and a half straight years in support of their highly successful 2002 debut, five years was just enough. And it shows. After the first listen, it is almost impossible not to notice the change in tone and musical style. One can argue that this album is more refined and produced than \\"Songs About Jane,\\" which songs allowed for more range and emotion (perhaps more freedom) to resonate with the listener. One can also say that this album depicts M5 in all its (mature) glory.  <br /> <br />To break down the M5 sound in a few words is literally impossible, and they show it here with the '70s disco single 'Makes Me Wonder,' which peaked at #1 on the Billboard Hot 100, to the epic ballad (also beautiful written) 'Better That We Break' to the brief but ultimately satisfying 'Little More Of Your Time.' There is also a track that, with its subtle hook at the beginning is vaguely Casino Royale-ish. Maybe that's just me, but have a listen to 'Goodnight, Goodnight.' Levine even makes the chorus he wrote and performed for Kanye West's 'Heard 'Em Say' into another song, 'Nothing Lasts Forever.'  <br /> <br />I will agree with some of the critics of this album in saying that yes, it is a shame that Levine's range isn't used to its utmost ability. And, there are moments when I feel have been touched one too many times. But, with all that aside, what makes M5 so successful and what keeps this album from being a \\"sophomore slump\\" is the incredible songwriting and composing done by Levine and the guys. They have that magical touch that make their songs golden. <br /> <br />Five recommended tracks (I'd recommend them all, but here are the absolute \\"must listens\\"): Little Of Your Time (Track 3), Wake Up Call (Track 4), Won't Go Home Without You (Track 5), Better That We Break (Track 11), Back At Your Door (Track 12) <br />Honorable mention: Goodnight, Goodnight (Track 8)

B000P6YNSE|5.0|LOST<br /><br />Rather than review this show based on all the myriad of detailed plot points, which I know have been discussed in great detail here and elsewhere, I will rather concentrate on why LOST is so popular and what it is about the core concept in LOST that has viewers engaged in such an intelligent way.<br /><br />What is the core universal appeal of LOST?<br /><br />Now remember I am not attempting to answer the mysteries of the show although I may hit on answers in this short review.<br /><br />LOST has a great appeal to viewers because it serves as a metaphor for the great mysteries of existence. This is the fundamental appeal of the show.  In our, the viewers, day to day lives spirituality is mostly absent. All the religions we were raised on did a very poor job of catching up with the modern world and modern concepts so we mostly abandoned the religions we were raised on.<br /><br />Now, that is a bold statement so I will add that religions are not wrong, per say, they are just lacking modern analogies or metaphors to help us as people relate to the fundamental mysteries of the universe.<br /><br />Some films have become modern metaphors for this gap in relating to the mysteries of the universe. These films are very popular as a result of this underlying content being presented so well, and so basic that we mostly do not even notice why we enjoy the movie so much. Star Wars The Lord of the Rings, and the Matrix are three such epics that serve as fine examples of this. Sure many are critical of SW but it has a universal appeal and I feel that appeal is because it points to basic concepts such as fate, the forces of the universe, good and evil, and more. Despite it's childish content it still has tremendous appeal due to the basis of its mythology.<br /><br />The Lord of the Rings, while having been written long ago also has these basic concepts so it is also very popular. It was also done very well. That is also a requirement for appeal. People will not stand for schlock film making with attempted pseudo intellectual content. We flee from such garbage or imitations. If something is too esoteric it attracts fewer people. Take 2001 a Space Odyssey or The Fountain as such examples of films with similar basic concepts but lack mass appeal because they are too heavy handed for the masses.<br /><br />Now, on to the Matrix. These films serve as a prime example of melding very deep heavy concepts such as have been discussed and melding them with action, love, and characters that the masses find appealing and combining it all together into a very brilliant metaphor for the deeper mysteries of the universe.<br /><br />I will mention Joseph Campbell here. He is worth reading and if you have read this far in my comments. He is the starting point for anyone who is unhappy with religion and seeks deeper answers. He is also a must read for writers and creative types alike. I fall into both categories and was introduced to him by my best friend. There are others like him out there but he was my gate to a larger understanding so starting with him is a good choice.<br /><br />Whether or not LOST ends brilliantly right now is irrelevant. The show has mass appeal due to the fact that the island is in the back of our minds a micro verse metaphor for the greater mysteries of the universe.<br /><br />Now how the show may end and what the secrets eventually are, are all speculation. There are however certain concepts, some of which have already been discredited, that would be lame.<br /><br />To me there are only really two tiers of possible universal endings that would be satisfying for me. Now true brilliance occurs when something I have not thought of is presented and is more brilliant and fantastic than anything that has been discussed of thought of. The show could end like this. Tier one for me as possible endings will be if the explanations given for all the mysteries on the show will be answered with the island being something alluding to existence, God, and the like. I am hoping that it will end more along the lines of a 2001 type ending than some silly, \\"We were all dreaming\\" Pincher Martin type ending.<br /><br />Tier two as far as possible endings go, and what will ultimately be satisfying but not as satisfying as my afore mentioned tire one, could be some sort of very government / illuminati / conspiracy / rouge all controlling group of humans. A kind of \\"we run the planet\\" or \\"We invented the island\\" or \\"We are in Charge\\" type group.<br /><br />As far as I am concerned the more esoteric God / power / mysterious universe power, (for lack of better term) fundamental answers will be the most satisfying because I believe that is why the show is appealing. To give answers less than my tire one ending would be less than satisfying.<br /><br />Now the show has another great vehicle that helps viewers to relate to the show and this is very obvious. These are all the characters. There is someone for everyone on LOST. No matter who you are there is a basic archetypal character there for you to relate to. The fact that Hurley saved the day in this season's finale is proof positive of this. The shows creators know this is a very basic reason why we like the show.  The esoteric stuff is there as a lure, the characters are there for us to individually relate to the lure. We all see ourselves in different aspects of each character. None of us is perfect and neither are the shows characters. Some of us do not know who we are until we are in certain situations and we decide how to act. This is played out time and again on LOST. Choice and fate. Engaging the universe or waiting for the universe to engage you. These concepts go back to Joseph Campbell and the Matrix. Are we in control or are we being controlled? As far as real actual non-TV reality goes I feel it's a bit of both. I feel that engaging the world and making choices helps fate work it's magic. While if we sit back and do nothing and play it too safe fate will take a back seat to your path in life and you will go nowhere and do nothing and be unsatisfied and not know why. LOST hits on these fundamental concepts which are with each and every one of us every day. Whether or not we believe in them matters not. They are buried in the back of our minds and we do not even know they are there. They operate in all of us just the same. If a show or film hits on them we light up and react positively and watch with baited breath till it ends.<br /><br />LOST, no matter how it ends is popular for the above-mentioned reasons. I hope the show stays brilliant. I hope the show ends brilliant and I hope it leads to more works of this type. Creative works like LOST allude to what is so fascinating about the very nature of existence. I feel we, as humans tend to overlook these mysteries, which surround us every day and every second. Good works of art are there to point to those mysteries. Films mostly, and now TV somewhat, are the modern vehicles to help us see these mysteries and point our way to deeper and more satisfying lives.<br /><br />Thanks for reading this.<br /><br />Carbonadamnes of a 2001 type ending than some silly, \\"We were all dreaming\\" Pincher Martin type ending.

B000OCXMAE|5.0|I, as most people, had a certain expectation when I bought this CD. I expected to pop it into my CD player, crank up the stereo, and rock out for a couple hours. So listening the first time was a real disappointment. My initial reaction was, \\"Average at best.\\" <br /> <br />However, after listening to it a couple days, I love this CD! There are a couple duds, as with any album, and they could do without a few of the slower songs. But the fact they've been able to pull off so much musical variety on one album is pretty damn impressive. I was listening to HT and Meteora today, and while I love love LOVE those CDs, they're very linear. Now, if you want the same old LP, then this is not the album for you. But if you appreciate variety, this is a CD that will quickly grow on you. I can't take it out of my CD player now!  <br /> <br />The only flaw is I HATE it when artists sing political songs. Not that I disagree, it just puts an awkward vibe in the song, for me. I want to purely enjoy the songs, not cringe.
0439813786|5.0|Selznick has succeeded in creating an instant classic. The concept for the design of the book, the \\"movie theatre\\" black and white pages, convey effectively the fascination with early black and white films. A young reader, as well as many adults, will appreciate learning something about the history of film magic.  This intriguing book flows both in narrative and design from from the feeling of a storyboard for an early film, and the execution of the concept in every detail is masterful.  The illustrations not only illuminate the story, but actually interpolate with the narrative, adding to the telling and the use of the readers imagination.  Recommend this book to film buffs young and old.

B0007ZEO4G|2.0|I'm sure a lot of Deep Purple purists will not find this review helpful, but to young vintage hard rock jedis out there who crave the bombast of bellbottomed madmen with battered Gibsons and Marshall stacks AND are curious about the Burn album, should find this review PLENTY helpful.<br /><br />'Burn' is a funk album, plain and simple.  If you are expecting this to<br />sound anything like 1970's 'In Rock' or EVEN 1973's 'Who Do We Think We Are' from the year prior, you'll be in a for a painful letdown.  Think of early Stevie Wonder (superstition era) being forced to sing and play Sabbath songs at gunpoint and you have this album.<br />Now let me make clear, I don't have anything against funk when it is done right.  Those craving pure, guitar-based funk should look to early Funkadelic (Maggot Brain and Free Your Mind..), Sly and the Family Stone, or even Grand Funk Railroad (Closer to Home, Grand Funk) However, It just doesn't sound right for Deep Purple.<br />The song 'Burn' is great.  It is fast, aggressive and full of virtuoso.  But it serves as a cushion to take the edge off the mediocrity of the rest of the songs.  Guaranteed, if this album kicked off with a different song like the embarassing 'Lay Down Stay Down', a bewildered headbanger of old would have tossed the vinyl across the room shattering it to pieces.  'Might Just Take Your Life'?  HAHAHA.  Sounds like a menacing title track doesn't it?  Actually, it sounds like it should have been a better opening theme song for 'Sanford & Son'.  'Sail Away' is a bit interesting and mellow; but at this point we're really craving another hard rock track.  It never comes.  'What's Going On Here?' is an ironic tune to be on the album, because.. frankly I was wondering the same thing.  A-100 is an instrumental which sounds like nothing else on the album, more like a corny Tangerine Dream experiment; definitely not a song to choose to sum up the Deep Purple sound in general!<br />Now the song, 'Mistreated' is great as it is a strong blues workout with a memorable riff and David Coverdale sings great on it too.  Thankfully, Glen keeps his mouth shut on this track because elsewhere, he sounds like an impoverished kid who was just let into Candyopolis at the mall.  In other words, it's obvious he's excited to be in Deep Purple. Sample a live version of 'Burn' where he shrills like a cat being tortured with a blowtorch during the verses and you'll know what I mean.  Anyways, 'Mistreated': great track.  Very much comparable to 'Since I've Been Loving You' on Zeppelin III.<br />I don't mean to discredit Coverdale and Hughes as musicians in general because Coverdale was great in Whitesnake and Hughes was AWESOME in Trapeze.  But 'Burn' as an album is just not up to par with the rest of the Deep Purple catalog, with the exception of the next album, Stormbringer, which was just as bad;  killer opening song, the rest stinkers.  Ritchie Blackmore then realized he was hanging with fellows who wanted to be the next Bootsy Collins, so he left and formed Rainbow.<br /><br />Hooray for Ritchie.
B000O75F7C|5.0|I recently discovered Porcupine Tree and can't get enough of them now.  To date, my favorite album has been \\"In Abstentia.\\" While this new effort doesn't have the same metallic fervor of that album, it grows on me with each listening - and I have been listening a lot.  The only thing not to like about this album is that it's only 51 minutes long, compared to over an hour for their most recent efforts, and I've gotten to like having my Porcupine Tree in larger doses.
B000NA2776|5.0|The songs on this CD are amazing.  It takes me back to the 80's and I totally agree wth all the others who say Mika sounds just like Fred Mercury- what a fresh great sound!!!!!
B00005JPFF|5.0|Things are great for Peter Parker (Maguire).  Everybody loves Spider-Man and Mary Jane (Dunst) is starring in a Broadway musical.  The only negative is Harry (Franco), who is still angry over the death of his father, and holds Peter responsible.  He has found his father's hidden supply of weapons and is ready to make Peter's life hell.  Meanwhile, Flint Marko (Church) has escaped prison, and while fleeing gets caught in an experiment that turns him into the Sandman.  Finally, a parasitic creature from space has infected Spider-Man's suit, giving him stronger powers and making him more aggressive.  Spider-Man must fight enemies both external and internal to save New York and his beloved Mary Jane.<br /><br />While better than the original \\"Spider-Man\\", \\"3\\" is falls short of the greatness of \\"2\\".  That was somewhat expected, I think, as \\"2\\" did everything right and would be almost impossible to top.  \\"3\\" has two main problems.  The first is length.  It is too long, but ironically with all the story crammed in there it almost feels rushed at times.  Given what happens in the film, I don't know what could have been trimmed.  This rushed storytelling results in the poor development of Venom.  Even unrushed, there are a number of coincidences that have to be accepted to allow for his development, but rushed they really feel forced and unnatural at times.  The good news is that the action and resolution of continuing storylines makes the film quite enjoyable.  The actors know their characters inside and out, and it is hard to imagine anyone else in these roles after all these years.<br /><br />\\"3\\" isn't the best of the lot, but it does allow the series to go out on a high note.  Or at least it lets these actors go out well.  There will certainly be more movies, regardless of Sam Raimi and the cast's involvement, that is sure.  \\"Spider-Man 3\\" is a great summer action film, and highly enjoyable despite its flaws.  I recommend seeing this film.
B000P46QIG|4.0|Whether they know it or not, Planet X owe a plethora of head nods to Chick Corea's mind-blowing (and bending) Elektrik Band efforts, which are essentially THE definitive templates for envelope-pushing post-fusion sonic adventurousness with rock instrumentation. Improvisation within form, intricate chord changes amidst chaos, impressive production from what one can only assume is a somewhat limited budget - all of this contradiction gives way to a remarkable cohesive result. Unlike Chick, though, Derek Sherinian doesn't get restrained by the world of \\"cool jazz\\" aesthetics. Rather, he rocks. Which, for anyone who likes to bang his or her head while tearing apart the meter changes and figuring out just what inversion is used over THIS bass note, that is something there just never seems to be enough of. \\"Quantum\\" is a drug with all the stages, including the nasty withdrawal symptoms when the disc ends. There's traces of Satriani, King's X, Rush and even Derek's X, Dream Theater. Amidst all of this (including a mighty tasteful guest spot from Allan Holdsworth), the thing still sounds unique. You can't help but wonder what Planet X could have achieved here had they tried to incorporate vocals into the seemingly effortless stream of integrity.

0316018953|4.0|In all of Harry Bosch's adventures, after the action is over Harry looks down at the view from his home and reflects on some aspect of his case, some aspect of his life, something someone said to him along the way. It provides a nice smoothing out of his day, and gives the reader time to reflect as Bosch reflects. I call it the \\"afterglow.\\" This novel doesn't have that, and so leaves the reader feeling an abruptness when the story ends. There is no afterglow.<br /><br />It also leaves out any personal life he has with his daughter, ex-wife, or Rachel Walling. So, what we have here is not another Harry Bosch novel, but a Harry Bosch short story. Once you understand the difference, it's a great story, but without the usual trademark Harry Bosch frills. Still excellent, but a no frills, abrupt, stripped down Harry Bosch story. If you are looking for the usual you might be a tad dissapointed, but if you understand up front what you're getting, and you're a Harry Bosch fan, then dive in. It's still very good, exciting action as only Connelly can provide.
B00007AJGH|5.0|This is a DVD you should own if you enjoyed this movie that came out nearly 20 years ago! It offers you the inside story on the behind the scenes production and the animation. It was too bad they didn't make a sequel for Roger Rabbit! Bob Hoskins was wonderful in this film. Still,its good entertainment for everyone!
B0000AZAUM|5.0|From the slow, steady beat of \\"Five Years\\" to the lavish, lamentable closing, \\"Rock & Roll Suicide\\"; \\"Ziggy Stardust\\" has held its own in Rock history.  Add the element of SACD (surround sound) and the album takes on a new life.  From the acoustical clapping of \\"Soul Love\\" to the hard driving guitars of \\"Suffragette City\\", this new mix finally and clearly separates all the instruments without isolating them.  It is a full band experience as if you were in the studio.  The acoustic guitars sound so crisp and clean and Mick Ronson's guitar work sounds like new.  Although the album has always suggested \\"To Be Played At Maximum Volume\\", the bass and drums are not as highly mixed as the rest.  That's a shame, as the beat here is legendary.  But, I still can't over-emphasize how great this version sounds, especially after marveling over \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\" and \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\\".  Hang on to yourself!
B000P2A256|4.0|I was waiting for this a long time. While mostly upbeat in the beginning tracks and somewhat lackadasical towards the end, I really was hoping for something much more WOW.<br /><br />This should have been called \\"Songs About {fill in name of female here}\\". Maroon 5 never seems to be able to create songs out about good relationships, only breakups. I mean, c'mon ... \\"6 ft tall, came without a warning, so I had to shoot him dead\\"? WHAT?<br /><br />Jeez, guys. Be happy. 5 years is a long time to wait for more \\"I realize I really hated you\\" stuff you already covered on 'Songs About Jane\\".<br /><br />Someone in Maroon 5 needs to quit dating shallow pretty girls and try to enjoy life with a down to earth female. Maybe then we'll hear songs that aren't so depressing.<br /><br />Or maybe not. Rumor has it that Maroon 5 may be breaking up soon ...
B00015YVD6|5.0|This was one of my favorite movies as a kid.  I thought Daryl Hannah was the prettiest thing on earth and I wanted to be just like her.  I used to swim in pools with my feet together and pretend I was a mermaid in the hopes that I could talk to marine life, sun myself on rocks, and be the object of mystery and myth.  Seeing it again just recently with the commentary made it a new and wonderful experience all over again. <br /> <br />Tom Hanks, an unknown, in Ron Howard's directorial debut, plays Alan, a happless, somewhat bumbling EveryMan who was rescued by a mermaid as a child.  He jumped off a boat in Cape Cod, and met the mermaid (later named Madison) underwater.  Years later, she once again rescues him from drowning, and comes to New York City in search of him.  As he and Darryl Hannah were unknowns, most of the heavy comedy routines were preformed by John Candy and Eugene Levy, who pay off everytime.  Part of the hilarious and sweet nature of this movie is Madison's innocence in the meanest city in America, New York.  Turning up naked at the Statue of Liberty and smiling so innocently at the crowd is just one of the hilarious scenes.  Watching it again with the commetary is a wonderful experience, as they tell tales of near mishaps, story outline, and how they did the special effects (the mermaid tale).  And even today, everytime I hear that a couple has named their new baby Madison, I remember that the name became so popular because of this movie. <br /> <br />This was made in an age where there was an E.T. formula for a lot of movies.  In that the lead (Tom Hanks) takes on a poor, helpless creature and tries to introduce said helpless creature into their world.  Eventually, like in E.T., an evil government force takes the helpless creature from the lead and they suffer.  The lead rescues the helpless creature from the clutches of the evil government force, and releases them to their natural habitat.  Unlike E.T., however, the lead goes with the creature.  Perhaps because E.T. was a movie staring children characters and Splash was a movie with adult characters, but Ron Howard reveiled in their commentary that in the original ending Alan didn't go with Madison to the sea.  But, his wife and others insisted to him that he had to change it and go with her. <br /> <br />Something that really hit home with me was something that John Candy said about love in this movie.  Tom says to him that he was angry and disappointed that the woman he loved more than anything was a fish.  People fall in love everyday, and look what he got!  John Candy says \\"Oh yeah, look what you got! People fall in love everyday?! Most people will never be that happy! I'll never be that happy!\\".  And that is certainly true.  People throw things away.  People make mistakes.  And, the world's full of lonely people.  Things don't always work out the way you want them to, especially with love.  So what if the woman's a fish?  Tom was pretty annoying too and she accepted him for what he was.  Too bad some people don't feel the same way. <br /> <br />Enjoy it.  Don't let this one get away.
B000OCXFCO|5.0|I've looked at many other websites in the past few days, reading up on this CD and seeing what the fans think. For some weird reason, this is the only site that has low ratings and reviews for Dave Mustaine's latest musical juggernaut. People, if you like talented musicians and fist pumping rock, buy this CD!    Many thanks to Dave and the band for another outstanding effort. 5 stars!
B00005R5G9|3.0|I thought this was an odd movie even when it first came out.  It was strange, no doubt about that.  But I had never heard of Pygmalion and didn't realize it was a sort of 80s version of it.  Still, it made for a few light hearted moments and silly humor. <br /> <br />Andrew McCarthy plays an artist type named Jonathan who can't seem to hold a job because he insists on throwing a creative spin onto everything and can't do it like the boss wants.  He lands a job at a department store, mostly in the hope of pursuing a dummy that he had created on a previous job.  (Weird)  She comes to life, and is actually a floating spirt named Emmy from ancient Egypt who is looking to be reincarnated in a more suitable time for women.  They go through some madcap adventures while it's just the two of them in the store at night (kind of like the future children's book series of Eloise at the Plaza), and they begin to create their own store window designs.  This attracts the attention of the public, and they reboost the store's popularity and revenue. <br /> <br />This was a cute idea, no doubt about that, but the movie tries too hard to create madcap adventures with the other cast of characters.  Hollywood the fellow store designer is so over the top gay.  The jealous store executive, the rivals at the other department store, and the semi psychotic security guard make for a few funny moments, but they are inflated and you know their half baked ideas will fail in the end and Jonathan will triumph.  And all the scenes where Emmy turns back into a dummy when others are around is a little too trite.  Still, it's a good time.
B000LPS3B2|5.0|Shutter was my first experience with a horror film made in Thailand and I was taken by its subtle terror and the skillful way that the suspense was built up over the course of the film. Shutter is the work of two young Thai directors, Banjong Pisanthanakun and Parkpoom Wongpoom, who, despite their inexperience, have crafted a mesmerizing film of horror, guilt, and sorrow.<br /><br />Tun, and his girlfriend Jane are heading home after a night of drinking with Tun's buddies when they hit a young woman walking in the road. Jane wants to get out to check on her but Tun urges her to drive away. In the days following the accident, Jane is wracked with guilt, wondering what happened to the woman while Tun's only worry is the neck pain he's experiencing from the accident. Tun is a photographer and he starts to notice strange images appearing in his pictures. Wisps of glare distort the images and what appears to be a shadowy figure is seen.<br /><br />Jane finally convinces Tun to re-visit the accident site but no trace of the girl is found and no hospitals report any accident victims from that night. They visit the publisher of a ghost magazine and he shows them dozens of photos with spiritual images in them...some fakes, yet others unexplained. The tensions mount as Jane learns about Tun's connection to the girl they hit on the road, a shy, former lover who he dated in college. The film builds masterfully towards an unsettling and utterly terrifying climax, the likes of which I've not experienced before. This is a ghost story in the true gothic tradition. A mournful, baleful spirit who elicits both fear and pity.<br /><br />At first I thought Shutter was just going to be another Ju-On type of film and it's almost as if the directors caught themselves falling into that inevitable comparison, and took things in another direction. It's a small film...the main characters (one or both) are onscreen nearly throughout the entire movie. Natthaweeranuch Thongmee as Jane and Ananda Everingham as Tun are wonderful and believable in their roles. Unlike so many low-budget American horror films where the actors play brainless characters, these two show amazing depth and have a genuine chemistry together. Again, considering their relative inexperience as actors, their performances are surprisingly real.<br /><br />What really propels Shutter is that it doesn't go for any cheap thrills or scares the way so many American films do...there's no gratuitous T &A, no obnoxious machismo from the male actors, just restrained, and powerful performances. These two young stars, and their directors have a great future in front of them.<br /><br />If there was one slight disappointment, it's that the DVD doesn't come with much in the way of extras. There's a brief interview segment with directors and cast, and some behind the scenes material but that's about it. The film is in Thai with English subtitles. You must see this one!nd Ananda Everingham as Tun are wonderful and believable in their roles.

B000MR9D5E|5.0|Absolutely the best series of its kind I have ever seen. The colors and magnificent scenery of our beloved planet are really breathtaking. My husband and I learned a lot about planet earth that we didn't know before. David Attenborough's narration was very moving and informative.  I recommend this series to anyone who loves the beauty of nature and who wants to learn more about our ever changing and vulnerable planet.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|What can you say...David Attenborough does it again...100% pure enjoyment and learning (yes, even that happens.)  Scenes from things 99.9% of us will never see in person.

0345438205|2.0|\\"Plagued with problems\\" is how I choose to describe \\"3001.\\"  I echo what J. R. R. Tolkien said about Lewis's conclusion to the Space Trilogy: I think it spoiled it.  ([[ASIN:0618056998 The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien]], 393).  In fact, I think this series is a good example of when a good franchise goes bad. \\"2001\\" is euphoric, \\"2010\\" is idealistic, \\"2061\\" is optimistic, but \\"3001\\" is sarcastic.  The future may have been a let-down, but his books need not be.<br /><br />What we wanted was a resolution to the Monolith Enigma, but what we got was an old geezer sounding off on religion, politics, circumcision, society, and religion.  Clarke has a gift to taking pre-sent day science, extrapolate it 20 years into the future, and then place today's man into tomorrow's world--exploring humanity's possibilities.  Sadly, the \\"silent artillery of time\\" has worn down his vision.<br /><br />Additionally, there are grave continuity errors.  Originally, the monoliths were blasting caps for primitive species' thinking caps; now they are just outdated hardware in need of an update patch.  In \\"2001,\\"  there are multiple monoliths on Earth (2001, Ch. 2), and after Moon-Watcher expands his mind, TMA-0 disappears (2001, Ch. 5), only to be dug up in Africa in  \\"3001.\\"  In \\"2010\\"'s epilogue \\"20,001,\\" Clarke presents the Europans with Swfitinan twist: bickering over religion, philosophy, and the nature of God the Monolith. But this discussion cannot happen, since the monoliths disappear, and the Europans are stuck in an evolutionary cul-du-sac (Ch. 31).  And, at the end of 2061 (my favorite of the series), the Great Wall has eBowman, eHal, and wise eFloyd as a human Holy Trinity (Clarke's words, not mine), but eFloyd is conspicuously absent (2061, Ch. 59).<br /><br />And there is eDave: Originally, he was the next step in human evolution. Now he is a semi-used subroutine, akin to a Yahoo! Widget.  The expression \\"Star Child\\" does not appear in this book, only as a back-cover blurb.<br /><br />Of these discontinuities, Clarke merely asserts that his books are not direct linear, sequels, but variations on the same themes, and occurring in parallel universes.  This explanation is really an excuse not to hold himself to higher standards. If each book is its own continuity, then why not have each chapter with its own continuity, or each sentence?  By disregarding the continuity, Clarke disregards the theme, the plot, and the whole purpose for writing a book.<br /><br />Then there are the difficulties in projecting future civilization.  Clarke honestly admits \\"A writer who sets out to describe a civilization superior to his own is obviously attempting the impossible. (\\"[[ASIN:0451058917 The Lost Worlds of 2001]]  Ch. 34).  Well, \\"physician, heal thyself.\\"  The cloned dinosaurs and kongs, the brain-computer interface, and using a computer virus to crash the Cosmic Server were science-fiction clich&eacute;s known to every John Q. Popcorn (P. 265).<br /><br />In the endless end-matter, Clarke excuses this last item by saying he never saw \\"[[ASIN:B00005V9IK Independence Day (Single Disc Widescreen Edition)]],\\" and claiming that he came up with it independently. Actually, this was used earlier in [[ASIN:B000063V8T Star Trek The Next Generation - The Complete Fifth Season]] \\"I, Borg.\\" And the computer virus was really a modification of a natural virus, which was H. G. Wells's deus ex machina in \\"[[ASIN:0375759239 The War of the Worlds (Modern Library Classics)]]\\"<br /><br />Speaking deus ex machina, this series is essential religious:  During the writing of 2001, Clarke noted, \\"Saw Carol Reed's film about Michelangelo `[[ASIN:B0006GANX2 The Agony and the Ecstasy]].' One line particular struck me--the use of the phrase `God mad man in His own image.\\" This, after all, is the theme of our movie.\\" (Lost Worlds of 2001, 39).<br /><br />Yet Clarke has a weird take on religions (Ch. 9), which is hilarious, since the franchise is essentially Christian:  Replace aliens with God, the monolith with Christ, and evolution with salvation, then you have the core Christian message. As Athanasius said, \\"God became man so that man might be god.\\" ([[ASIN:0913836400 On the Incarnation (De Incarnatione Verbi Dei)]])  What C. S. Lewis wrote about Christ applies to Dave Bowman: \\"In Christ a new kind of man appeared; and the new kind of life which began in Him is to be put into us.\\" ([[ASIN:0060652926 Mere Christianity]]).<br /><br />Think of the Monolith Trinity: Floyd is the wise Father, Bowman the son who dies and is a mediator, and Hal is a fine Holy Ghost.  Why, then did Clarke feel the need apologize to people of faith in his endless end-matter?  He has just started his own religion with the story.<br /><br />*<br /><br />I was fascinated to learn that the book's core idea goes back to the brainstorming sessions for \\"2001.\\"  In his journal, Clarke recorded that the monoliths may be malevolent: \\"Suggested to Stanley that `they' might be machines who regard organic life as a hideous disease.  Stanley thinks this is cute and thinks we've got something.\\" (Lost Worlds, p. 32)<br /><br />More to the point: \\"Fighting hard to stop Stan from bringing Dr. Pool back from the dead.  I'm afraid his obsession with immortality is overcoming his artistic instincts.\\" (Lost Worlds of 2001, p.  36).<br /><br />Ahem!<br /><br />I dislike this books.  I would have preferred having the Trinity of Bowman, Hal, and Floyd meet with Poole discuss the possibility of the monoliths malfunctioning.  Then have the Trinity get control of some portion (or all)  of the monolith network.  The book could have ended with the threesome setting the monoliths on back on track, or meeting Clindar and the Firstborn, or even the higher Powers that Be.<br /><br />So can Clarke salvage the franchise? They may be a story in-between 2061 and 3001 that would account for Floyd's absence. Another thread  would be the nano-reassembly of Dave, hinted at in Chapter 6.  The monolith's supervisor is 450 l.y. away, so that gives us a time frame for a response (Ch. 34).  Or we would finally me the Firstborn or the powers and entities that are higher than Firstborn, as they send repair crews to fix the malfunctioning monoliths.<br /><br />This last one may be what Clarke wants: an apology from God.<br /><br />(Too bad Douglas Adams already did this in \\"[[ASIN:0345391829 Life, the Universe and Everything (Hitchhiker's Trilogy)]]\\")<br /><br />P.

B000063DFQ|4.0|1983's Piece Of Mind is the album on which Iron Maiden's \\"classic\\" lineup came together. With the addition of drummer Nicko Mcbrain Maiden finally stabilized and would go on to record four consecutive albums with the same group of musicians starting with this, their fourth LP.    Whether you love or hate Iron Maiden, you have to admit that the musicmanship is superb. The twin guitar team of Dave Murray and Adrian Smith serves up crunchy rhythms, harmonized melodies, and searing back-to-back solos all with equal aplomb. Murray's firey shred is perfectly counter-balanced by Smith's more melodic approach. Steve Harris' bass is inventive and solid, often coming across more like a third guitar than a bass. Soaring over the top of it all is vocalist Bruce Dickinson, coming across with an operatic vocal style that fits in perfectly with the band's progressive leanings. The new drummer, Nicko Mcbrain, proves himself quite able, although in truth I preferred previous skinsman Clive Burr. Everybody performs at their peak on this album, and these performances are captured on tape by legendary producer Martin Birch. The recording is very good, quite crisp with all the instruments nicely balanced. It's very dry, however, lacking the ambience that usually characterises a Birch recording. I have to say that these remasters are awful. Birch's excellent production work is completely ruined. See if you can find the original CD releases.    This album contains more songs than most of Maiden's other '80s releases, and most of them are superb. Maiden is a band with several excellent songwriters and they truly hit their stride on this album. \\"Revelations\\" is a great masterpiece with gentle verses and a brutal chorus, \\"The Trooper\\" is blazing rocker with a hard-driving gallop rhythm, \\"Still Life\\" is positively spooky, and \\"Where Eagles Dare\\" is pure metal mayhem. The album ends on a high note with the great epic \\"To Tame A Land\\", based on the science fiction series Dune. Most of the othertracks are also excellent but I have to deduct half a star for the horribly lame \\"Quest For Fire\\".    Don't miss out on this great metal masterpiece. If they'd simply left out \\"Quest For Fire\\" and gone with just eight songs (like most other Maiden records) this would be a perfect five star album. Pick it up.

It is a true story about a young caddy who wins the U.S. Open in the early 1900's, and it is such and interesting story that it would appeal to both old and young viewers.  My family watches this movie every time it's on so we bought it.  We also bought the book that it is based on.
B00004Y6NP|5.0|One think I really admire about Dire Straits is that, whether it was intentional or not, the music they made in the 80's (and 70's) stands up REALLY well today, and you'd never know this stuff was recorded during a time when big drum machines and loud beats were the most popular thing on the music scene. <br /> <br />Brothers In Arms is all about being a very good rock album during a time when rock was changing, and being *very* pleasing in the process.  The entire first side is nothing but one HUGE radio hit after another.  You know the songs.  They are all really good, and take me back to my childhood.   <br /> <br />\\"Money For Nothing\\" NEVER gets old, especially that slow build-up in the beginning.  I remember when me and my parents went looking for a refrigerator one night right after this album came out, and this song always reminded me of that night because of the part when the band mentions a refrigerator in the lyrics.  \\"Walk of Life\\" reminds me of my mom.  GREAT song. <br /> <br />The second side, while initially it seems weaker, it's actually not, and the title song is one of those soothing builder-uper type songs.  It's great.  The entire album is highly enjoyable.  For those of you who were children back in the mid 80's, it's worth hearing again for the memories.
B000OCXMAE|4.0|Linkin Park, arguably the biggest and best band of the whole rap rock era has done what all of the others have done, evolved. For all of those who cast verbal stones upon the LP, think before you throw. Limp Bizkit changes, they fail. Papa Roach changed their sound and inturn have been forced to succumb to their last resort, the WWE. Linkin Park changes after a 6 year hiatus and they skyrocket to number 1 on the charts. But have they sold out and created meaningless commercialized rock, or is it more? <br /> <br />       \\"Minutes to Midnight\\" is without a doubt the slowest, yet most personalized and raw album that Linkin Park has painstakenly created. Though the cd only offers three tracks that live up to the high octane, metallic angst that they were once known for (\\"Given Up,\\" \\"Bleed it Out,\\" and \\"No More Sorrow.\\") its lyrics are just as powerful and unabashedly honest as anything in their back catalogue.  <br />     <br />       Mike Shinoda's genius is evident in the take no prisoners display of disgust and disapproval that is \\"Hands Held High\\" and \\"In Between,\\" his singing debut where he wears his heart on his sleeve like a wounded hero wears that little purple heart. \\"The Little Things Give You Away\\" follows suit in an epic manner with its mellow tone, yet brutally honest lyrics directed at our president and his war. <br />    <br />       Front man Chester Bennington's voice is as strong as ever on the aforementioned heavier tracks. His seemingly dual level vocals are on point and his screams are as animalistic as ever, but he takes \\"MTM\\" to showcase his actual singing ability. \\"Valentines Day\\" and \\"Shadow of the Day\\" are gripping tales in which Bennington's subtly powerful vocals and lyrics border on pretty, albeit in a depressing manner. \\"In Pieces\\" mixes a hip hop beat with a ska like guitar riff, and shockingly, a solo from guitarist Brad Delson. Its unique sound and emotive lyrics cut right to the heart, making it (arguably)the best track on the album. <br />     <br />       For those who will accept nothing but old Linkin Park, \\"Minutes to Midnight\\" will surely disappoint. But for those who appreciate emotion, feeling, and talent in their music, this is the album you have been waiting for. Everything and everyone changes. Embrace the change with Linkin Park. <br />

031286504X|5.0|I got this book as a preview for the upcomming film I am Legend with will smith this winter.  The book was amazing and I had a hard time putting it down.  It has everything a horror fan can live for.  There are elements of Zombie films as the character is traped from infection.  Also takes the Vampire theory and runs with it.  Interesting and A great buy.  Matheson's short stories at the end is a added bonus as they are a good read as well.  If you want a good book to read I would choose this one.
B000001FOL|5.0|Nico's impact can still be heard and felt today. The fact that this album was released in 1967 baffles me when you consider the sound of popular music of that time. Nico was a true original, and perhaps one of the first authentic \\"alternative\\" artists of our time. This album is beautiful, string-laden and passionate. Nico can make you feel blue without totally bringing you down. Her voice is what it is: imperfect, childlike and yet (most importantly) VERY MUCH HER OWN. Listen with an open mind, don't listen to the Nico nay sayers, and cut the girl a break: she was only trying to infuse some beauty into this ugly little world.
031286504X|5.0|Richard Matheson's I AM LEGEND has become a legend in both the horror and science fiction genres. Published in 1954, the story concerns the future; the 1970's where a strange plague has spread across the world, which has turned most if not all of the human race into vampires. This plot may sound a bit corny but this classic novel is anything but...<br /><br />Richard Neville has not been infected by the plague. The poor man's daughter and wife are dead and he is all alone, barricaded in his home at night while the \\"undead\\" scream and throw bricks at his house, and by day, he trolls the city killing as many as he can find.<br /><br />More than the surface plot, this tale is a study in loneliness and a man's on-going effort to remain sane under conditions that would drive anyone around the bend.<br /><br />Neville also has resorted to binge drinking to escape his plight and through the novel comes to terms with this addiction or \\"monster\\" and settles into a calm routine of study and survival.<br /><br />Matheson is an excellent writer of the macabre and unusual. In this tale the genres are a mix between horror and science fiction. In fact Matheson is known to write outside these traditional categories and push the envelope of his trade. The list of his work certainly proves this, writing such classics now as [[ASIN:0312868855 Hell House]], [[ASIN:0899665144 Bid Time Return]] and [[ASIN:0765308703 What Dreams May Come: A Novel]].<br /><br />If you haven't read Matheson before I AM LEGEND would be a good place to begin.<br /><br />Excellent.
B00000HZFP|5.0|SHEER ROCK MUSICAL PERFECTION. JOHN CAMERON MITCHELL AND STEPHEN TRASK ARE AMAZING. FUNNY TO ROCK OUT TO A SHOW SOUNDTRACK... THAT WAS A FIRST. BUT YOU CAN'T HELP YOURSELF. I PREFER THIS TO THE FILM SOUNDTRACK FOR NO OTHER REASON THAN IT HAS A RAW EDGE TO IT UNLIKE THE SLICK STUDIO TRACKS OF THE OTHER.
0330351699|3.0|This book is a great way to kill time at an airport, bus station, or insurance seminar. It is essentially an extended magazine article, sweatily manipulated in order to get to the Cibola of two-hundred pages. Krakauer is a decent writer, with a decent vocabulary (despite misusing the word \\"enormity\\" to mean \\"vastness\\"), and a spiritual kinship with Chris McCandless, the silly man whose naivete, idealism, and, let's face it, pretension, led to his starvation.    Ironically, you won't find \\"meaning\\" here...but you will find a page-turning, entertaining little book.
0375831002|5.0|At the age of 30, Zusak accomplishes something most writers can only dream of - a book that encapsulates both the beauty and cruelty of the world with startling, poetic words and characters that live and breathe.  The story is captivating and it has been a long time since I've read a novel that has touched me so deeply.  I am an English teacher and school librarian, so trust me when I say that I don't write reviews lightly.  This is an excellent book for young adults and adults alike and it is one of the best stories I've ever read about war and life.  As others have stated, this book is heartwrenching at times - but so is life.  Like Liesel, Zusak is a \\"Word Shaker\\"; you won't be disappointed.
B000022TSH|5.0|Great actors, script, and direction. Very good film noir technique.  Worth seeing many times. The details are great.
031286504X|4.0|Wow.  The style of this book is probably its best aspect, perfectly attuned to the pace of the story, showing how a man deals with a Robinson Crusoe scenario, alebit one where his neighbors and friends are the undead trying to suck his blood.  I would give it five stars but I didn't like the ending, not enough of a wrap-up.
0786868694|3.0|I own several of Nigella's cookbooks and this one has some great recipes, like the chocolate cloud cake, ham and coca-cola and chocolate-lime cheesecake. But I have had really bad luck with some too. The Southern Style Fried Chicken recipe calls for you to poach the chicken first, which I found overcooks it and leaves you with soggy not crispy chicken in the end. A lot of the desserts are overly sweetened with sugar and I had to cut back on it. Some of the cakes are dry too. I am happy that there are so many gorgeous pics of the dishes so I know what the end result should be. Icould live without the multiple pics of her, though I know that helps the books sell. I also enjoyed reading her short little introductions to almost each recipe. I'd recommend this, but only as a used item to save some $ for more consistently good cookbooks.
074322454X|5.0|This book rules.  I should read a lot more Ambrose, but I haven't.  His command of the subject and the beautifully edited quotes create a multi-voiced narrative with depth and subtelty which nevertheless follows a stirring storyline.  The book takes a little less time than the series, which is terrific, with complete excerpts of events such as the taking of Foy and the drop into Normandy.  In terms of historical narrative, this is absolutely tops.  One of the best-written nonfiction books I've ever read. I'm not terribly interested in WWII, but this book gets me really stoked to read more.
1401301363|4.0|I have all but one of Nigella's cookbooks and this is my favorite. Since I bake rather than cook a lot this review focuses on the baking recipes. After having made a lot of the recipes from this book and her others I have been disappointed more than I thought I would be. Some of the recipes turn out very dry. But this book offers a unique layout by feast and/or holiday and some good, potentially great recipes if they were just tweaked or reworked a little- like the Chocolate Truffle Cake, Lemon Meringue Cake and Chocolate Gingerbread. The only problems are that some of the recipes are not exact enough or have some issues. For instance, with the truffle cake some people complained that the thin layer of cocoa sifted on top made them choke, but the cake and meringue crust were a hit. Also, she does not mention in this recipe that if you do not slowly add a little of the melted chocoalte to the cream them mix the rest in you can get little grainy chocolate pieces rather than a smooth base. The lemon meringue cake is also beautiful, but I would recommend just doing meringue disks, cream and curd and not the cake part since it is SO DRY.  The chocolate gingerbread is utter bliss though. The pictures are utterly amazing and the stories behind them are fun to read.I also liked the way the book is set up kinda by holiday rather than the traditional appetizers, main course, desserts, etc. here little background jaunts over where  she found or came up with the recipes is a pleasure to read and she is very descriptive in a very sensual way. For some this may be a little tiring. Another plus, this is a big cookbook with lots of recipes andd color pics, which is just great. It's a beautiful cookbook with fun, vibrant, sensual dishes. Overall, I'd recommend this book as her best work so far. If you are a some what experienced home baker able to see some minor flaws in recipes and be creative in re-working the recipes and enjoy being inspired by dishes I'd recommend picking this up.p.

0743289412|2.0|I've read everything that Stephen King has written and have enjoyed most, if not all, of his books.  This book, however, is the first and only one  that I've actually put down and considered never picking up again.  It was truly grueling, but I did force myself through it -- reading just a few pages at a time before dozing off!  If you manage to get through the first half of the book, you finally get a sense of where the story is going and it starts to move along and become a little more interesting.  Although King seems to have fun making up words and phrases, it is so excessive in this book that it becomes extremely annoying.  I was relieved when I finally finished the book and didn't have to pick it up again.  I kept wondering if King was having a good laugh thinking about all of the fools that would buy this book simply because he wrote it!  He had to have some idea what his readers would think, but I guess he didn't care.

B000HCO83Q|4.0|So I went to see this movie on opening day with some friends and I came away satisfied.  I saw it for the second time, but I wasn't excited that some characters were nowhere to be found (Nightcrawler) and others were cast aside early on into the movie (Cyclops & Mystique).Though some characters did get decent and meaningful deaths (Professor X & Jean) the deaths still felt unneeded.   <br />This week I wasn't feeling to great and was trying to find something to watch that I hadn't already seen a hundred times and I picked X-men 3.  I turned on the movie expecting that an hour and forty-eight minutes of my life would be wasted. Luckily I was wrong. <br />Sure this movie isn't the best movie ever, but by no means is it the worst movie ever. It's a fun action movie; if you're looking for a deep, emotional story then this won't be your cup of tea, but if you're looking to get away for awhile and just have some fun then this movie is definitely worth the rental price. <br />

B000002G26|4.0|This is a good Bryan Adams compilation and will please any fan.  It's got his good rock stuff from the 80s.  You know, strong vocals and a strong guitar.  Definitely rock, but not heavy metal.  Good music to have on the car radio as you're cruising along.  The ballads he did back then, which are on here too, were good.  Bryan's later stuff doesn't measure up.  This is the heart of his music.
1594489505|5.0|A Thousand Splendid Suns is one of those rarest of novels, a work of fiction that stakes an uncontested claim to the status of literature immediately upon publication. Khaled Hosseini has written a majestic, sweeping, emotionally powerful story that provides the reader with a most telling window into Afghan society over the past thirty-odd years. It's also a moving story of friendship and sacrifice, giving Western readers a rare glimpse into the suffering and mistreatment of Afghan women that began long before the Taliban came to power. Not only does the novel reveal the ruthlessness and pure evil of the Taliban, its chronicle of Afghanistan's bloody, repressive recent history helps demonstrate why we must remain constantly vigilant as the nation's move to democracy inches forward a little bit at a time. Centuries of embedded traditions and cultural proscriptions cannot be changed overnight, yet never again must the women of Afghanistan be forgotten.<br /><br />Hosseini treats us to two main characters, each of whom embodies the time-honored endurance and suffering of the Afghan woman. Mariam grows up with her mother Nana in a humble home isolated from the hustle and bustle of the nearby city of Herat. Jalil, Mariam's father, visits once a week and dotes on his little girl, and it is Mariam's dearest wish to join Jalil's family in the city. Her mother disabuses her of such notions, offering her child a radically different opinion of her father. Mariam is illegitimate, and Nana tells her that she will never be recognized as Jalil's daughter. Mariam learns this lesson for herself at age fifteen, setting in motion a dark series of events that soon finds her married to an older man, Rasheed, in the city of Kabul. Scared, lonely, and dealing with a weight of guilt over her mother's death, Mariam soon finds misfortune permanently affixed to herself as her surly husband grossly mistreats and ignores her.<br /><br />Meanwhile, young Laila grows up in the same Kabul neighborhood, the daughter of a teacher and a spirited mother. Her constant companion is Tariq, a boy who - despite having lost a leg to a land mine - never hesitates to defend her. Not surprisingly, she falls in love with Tariq, but the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan tears them apart just as their love manifests itself physically. As the mujahideen fight the Soviets and then turn on one another in the political vacuum left by the Soviet withdrawal, Kabul becomes a war zone, its days and nights filled with the mortal uncertainty of rocket impacts and gun battles. Fate is particularly unkind to Laila, who ultimately finds herself all alone, injured, and extremely vulnerable. Harboring a great secret in her heart, she reluctantly becomes Rasheed's second wife. Not surprisingly, Mariam resents this young girl whom Rasheed has brought into her already unhappy home, but in time, after Laila becomes a fellow victim of Rasheed's disdain, insults, and physical abuse, the two women develop a close relationship, one strong enough to sustain them through even harder times ahead.<br /><br />The novel takes us through thirty years of tumultuous Afghan history, as seen through the eyes of two remarkable but representative, long-suffering women, from a time when women could basically lead their own lives, through the socio-economically devastating years of the Soviet invasion and the mujahideen resistance, on through the even more destructive years after the Soviets pulled out and Afghan warlords turned upon one another (killing countless innocent civilians in the process), all the way up to the Taliban seizure of power and its displacement by American and Allied forces in the wake of 9/11. As Mariam's mother taught her, endurance is the key to surviving as a woman in Afghanistan. Increasingly insolated as events unfolded, women such as Mariam and Laila had no one to turn to but each other, as their very humanity was taken away from them by increasingly repressive leaders and their own ever-more-violent husbands. Some women broke under the pressure of so much turmoil and heartache; others fled the country to escape the danger and repression; but women such as Mariam and Laila simply endured in the face of hellish circumstances.<br /><br />I'm a man, and I know enough not to pretend I understand women, but the power of Hosseini's eloquent writing produced in me a feeling of real kinship for Mariam, Laila, and Laila's daughter Aziza. I am quite sure this is as close as I will ever come to truly beginning to appreciate the scale of the Afghan woman's plight. So many memorable scenes, so many horrible events stand out in the lives of these brave women. The best they could hope for was to be ignored - spared the physical and mental abuse of husbands, and in many cases relieved to hide themselves behind the burquas the Taliban insisted they wear in public. The Taliban stripped them of their very humanity, making them less than slaves, yet these women refused to be crushed by the system, exhibiting a kind of unparalleled courage and self-sacrifice that few men could ever hope to match. History enumerates the crimes of the Taliban, but Hosseini paints a truly compelling portrait of life in a land where flamingoes could not be painted without trousers covering their bare legs and where many citizens risked obscene torture just to obtain black market copies of the movie Titanic.<br /><br />There is tragedy in A Thousand Splendid Suns - heart-breaking tragedy - yet the story is ultimately an inspirational epic with the power to enlighten the reader spiritually as well as historically. As you read this engrossing novel, all cultural and political barriers separating you from Hosseini's characters disappear and you cannot help but me moved by the sad fact that our fiction has been many a poor Afghan woman's reality. This eye-opening read has the power to change your view of the world and your place in it, and that makes it a truly masterful piece of literature.own ever-more-violent husbands.

B0001HAHXW|3.0|One of the things that first turned me on to Eric Clapton was an early live rendition of \\"Crossroads\\" which (I believe) came from a Cream concert.  It was so good and so incendiary that it actually seemed to transcend the intentions and vision of the original songwriter.  It was truly a defining moment for both Clapton as an individual artist and for rock music in general.  Unfortunately, Eric set a very high standard for himself with that recording, and he has had a tough time matching its passion and intensity through the years.  He came very close with \\"From the Cradle\\", which has a great live-from-the-club feel to it, great guitar playing and above-average singing. <br /> <br />On balance, \\"Riding With the King\\" is arguably a better record than either \\"Me and Mr. Johnson\\" or \\"From the Cradle\\", but it isn't an Eric Clapton record per se (the presence of B.B. King, and some exceptional songs, make the difference).  So, if you're looking for a good straight blues record which mainly features EC, I would start with \\"From the Cradle\\" and go from there.  If you just want the best blues/rock record that he was involved with in recent times, I would start with \\"Riding With the King\\". <br /> <br />I've read that the tracks for \\"Me and Mr. Johnson\\" were recorded in between takes during the \\"Back Home\\" sessions in order to keep the band on point.  When listening to the \\"M&MJ\\" record I got the distinct impression that the songs weren't really sweated over or necessarily intended for release at the time.  It appears that this project was more or less an afterthought, albeit a pretty good one.  Eric's debt to Robert Johnson is without question, so officially paying homage to the master makes total sense.  And it's a true testament to Eric's talent that a collection of his outtakes turned out better than many artists' finished work.   <br /> <br />At the end of the day though, EC was in a very contented state of mind during these sessions-happily married and enjoying his children.  Domestic tranquility doesn't usually lend itself to brilliant blues playing unless you're a tremendous actor in addition to being a great musician.   On top of that, even when Eric does have the blues (after the death of his son Conor, for example), his vocals have never been able to measure up to the unbridled emotion evident in his best guitar playing.  <br /> <br />One of the highlights of this record is \\"They're Red Hot\\", which conjurs up a mental image of Eric vamping in his living room for the children's amusement.  It's fun and it's loose.  Whereas Eric's treatment of the darker pieces just seems flippant and uninspired at times. I would much rather recommend the Rolling Stones' version of \\"Love In Vain\\" and Led Zeppelin's version of \\"Travelling Riverside Blues\\". <br /> <br />So, with all due respect to Eric Clapton (who I admire greatly), I would say that this recording is good rather than great.

B000P12LWY|5.0|I am an admitted history dork and loved Rome on HBO, after it finished airing and I heard about the Tudors I thought I was not going to get into another mini series. Darn Showtime though.. they put the first two episodes on Showtime on demand before it aired.. genius move.. the first one was okay.. and then by the second I was hooked.  the story is about 90% accurate there are a few changes but nothing major.. the beauty of this shows that history need not be boring or dull.. its a beautiful lavish production Showtime should be proud of.. also if you like this type of thing Get Elizabeth 1 (with Helen Mirren) also and HBO production.. HBO has seemed to have a handle on this genre.. Showtime should be proud of this one and unlike Rome which after two season was finished.. with Henry's life, history and wives I hope it continues for years to come..<br /><br />I am thrilled they are now working on season two.. I can't get enough and lOVE they put the episodes early on demand... can't WAIT for season 2!!!!! Get this.. you will NOT be disappointed.

Anyway, the fellow at EMI Records in NY who handles Norah Jones emailed me back to let me know that they never made a HDCD for Norah Jones and that this one is Pirated and that they are now investigating the matter. Gold CD with extra tracks and 24 bits... too good to be true! Jody Koval

1567184855|5.0|I will concede that while it is true, Newton cannot prove with absolute certainty that any of the information outlined in this book can be scientifically proven, I believe that the validation comes from the over whelming continuity of his clients who, once regressed under hypnosis conceived the 'same fictive dream'.  I would challenge anyone to explain this phenomena.  While it's possible that he may have asked questions that may have led his clients to certain conclusions, make no mistake, while under hypnosis, one tells the truth as he or she knows it.  I am a certified hypnotherapist and know this to be the truth. <br />If nothing else, this book and its companion, Destiny of Souls, are absolutely fascinating to read.  I would read with an open mind.  You may be surprised, if not amazed at the visions or memories it incites within you.
B000H5V8DG|2.0|I received this as a birthday gift and was concerned due to the fact that so many others had issues regarding scratched discs. Upon opening the box and examining each disc I noticed all mine were also scratched and marred as well which is a shame since the box design is cool. I figured since so many others had the same issue what was the point of exchanging it as I would probably just get another defective item. I then sent all my discs to be professionally repaired and cleaned and this corrected most of the issues although that cost me almost $80. I just cannot believe that a product this expensive could be this defective and as such highly recommend buying the individual seasons in lieu of this.
B0002NRQTI|4.0|It took me a long time to admit to myself that I like Rush. Coming from a hardcore punk/speedmetal/psychotic underground musical background, Rush always struck me as a group of  sensitive ponytail milquetoasts, playing lightweight rock for geeky music nerds. Over the course of several years, I was eventually able to admit to myself that I did in fact like songs such as Fly By Night, Spirit of Radio, Freewill, Tom Sawyer, Limelight, etc. The coup de grace hit me when I heard the band Thrones perform a song called The Oracle and I complimented Joe that it was one of his best songs. \\"Oh... that's actually a Rush song, it's from 2112.\\" My jaw hit the floor and that was when I started buying Rush albums. I started with the debut and went chronologically. Everything was great until I reached their 1982 album Signals. That was when the keyboards and synthesizers took over and the guitars were shoved to the back burner. I lost interest instantly and stopped buying the albums.<br /><br />That was probably at least 10 years ago. Very recently, something made me want to hear more Rush. I bought Grace Under Pressure, Power Windows, Hold Your Fire, and Roll the Bones. As soon as I started listening to Grace Under Pressure, I knew that I had been right to stop buying albums after Signals. Such ineffectual, weaksauce synth drivel. Then I moved on to Power Windows, and I was absolutely certain that the album was in fact a dimensional doorway that led straight to the Ninth Plane of Hell. I contemplated suicide at least 12 times before the album was over. It sounded like the soundtrack to the most generic, insipid mid-80s inspirational teen movie you can imagine. I could close my eyes and see some spotty faced kid training hard to learn martial arts, pushing himself too hard, failing, and then getting up and trying harder... sweet Lord, it was unbearable. Hold Your Fire was a mild improvement, or at least slightly less painful. Still quite horrid and much too 'lite rock' for my tastes. Roll the Bones was another slight improvement. It was nice to hear more guitars and almost no keys.<br /><br />And then finally this morning I came to Counterparts. Not quite a return to form per se, but definitely the sound of a band who had finally remembered after many long years how good it feels to simply ROCK. This is the best thing they'd done since Moving Pictures, hands down. This makes all the pain and suffering I endured listening to mid-80s Rush all worth it, because it puts this album into context.<br /><br />For the record, I just finished listening to Test For Echo, which is good but not as good as Counterparts. Right now I'm taking in my first listen of Vapor Trails... which I can already tell is their hardest and heaviest album ever. Tomorrow I believe I shall pick up a copy of Snakes & Arrows.s.

055358202X|3.0|By now, fans know the deal: the long-awaited fourth book in George R.R. Martin's fantasy series turned out to be just too darned long, so the publisher and author decided to cut the book in two, with \\"A Feast For Crows\\" being the first of the two halves to be released.<br /><br />But it wasn't a simple matter of just giving us the first half of a very long book.  No, Mr. Martin decided to pull out and present to us all the chapters set in Kings Landing (the developed, mostly civilized kingdoms of the author's fictional world), and save all the chapters set in the wilder, outlying realms for the next book.<br /><br />The problem is, the Kings Landing chapters contain nothing but intrigue and scheming.  This worked fine in the previous installments, because we'd get a Kings Landing \\"scheming\\" chapter, then some good old-fashioned barbarism in a \\"Dothraki\\" chapter, then some mysterious weirdness in a \\"Beyond the Wall\\" chapter, etc., etc.  But in this book, all we get is intrigue, intrigue, intrigue.<br /><br />Ultimately, the book is still fun, still engaging, and still entertaining, but the variety of storylines and shifts in tone of previous volumes are sorely missed here.  Also sorely missed are series favorites Tyrion Lannister, Jon Snow (who at least briefly appears in a \\"Samwell Tarley\\" chapter), Bran Stark, and a few others.  Yes, I know that these characters- and several others- will return in the next book, but that doesn't help matters here.<br /><br />But, for what it's worth, I'm still onboard for that next book, \\"A Dance of Dragons\\", which I hope will be out soon.  I'm also hoping that I won't be complaining that \\"Dragons\\" is too heavy on action and doesn't contain enough intrigue.  But I guess I shouldn't get catty before I've read the thing.
B00004Z459|4.0|Linkin Park is not metal. They are considered nu-metal or maybe alternative metal, but don't expect balls-out metal.  There is rapping, lots of melody, scratching, and some hip-hop elements combined with a hard-edged rock sensibility.  They have a very polished, distinguishable sound that pours out of any sound system with gusto. I usually enjoy heavier music, such as Lamb of God and Mastodon, but I really keep my mind open to other styles as well. LP is just too good to ignore. They have a knack for writing hit songs and yet it doesn't seem like they are trying too hard. When I listen to heavy music, there has to be great riffs, vocals, and hooks. If any of those three things is missing, I shelve it. LP has all three and this was one of the best cds of 2000. It took awhile to convert me, but I consider them to be one of the better bands to come out of the nu-metal scene. The entire cd is great, no filler. Lots of hit songs. \\"Papercut\\", \\"One Step Closer\\", \\"Crawling\\", \\"In the End\\" and \\"Points of Authority\\".
B000MQC9H4|4.0|I rented this movie and watched it twice before deciding to buy.  The characters in the movie can be easily related to--situation wise, that is.  Any woman who's been hurt can relate to the feelings of Kate Winslet's character, and those who feel emotionally closed off will identify with Diaz's character.  Jack Black is loveable and surprisingly attractive in the film, and Jude Law's performance will leave you shouting \\"men like you don't exist!\\" at the screen...all the while bringing tears to your eyes and a smile to your face at the same time.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|This is an amazing series, and on HD-DVD it was unreal.  To anyone who likes nature shows, or to anyone interested in the state of the world today, I can't recommend this product enough. I have also seen the normal DVD version, and with the high-def, slow motion filming, it looks almost as good as th HD version.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|People dont want to amdit that they changed, but LP changed, and they changed for the good. Everything changes, the world, weather, people and yes BANDS change too.. This proves that they have more to give than just one sound. Face it.. things change, wake up and realize this is their best CD..
076790382X|4.0|this book is a collection of articles B.B. plublished in a british newspaper.<br /><br />Most are amazingly funny - in the laugh-out-loud kind of way, and very few are slightly boring (but as they are all just a few pages long you can go through them realy fast or just skip them). I would definitely recommend this book.
B000002KHH|5.0|Paranoid's virtually undisputed claim to fame is the heralding of the dawn of metal.  Black Sabbath's debut album is perhaps the proper one to consider, but for whatever reason it didn't get much notice until after the release of Paranoid.  With the release of Paranoid's title track as a single and the underground hit, Iron Man, Black Sabbath showed their colors and unleashed an entirely new and still thriving genre of music.  They stripped down their music to its naked essence, challenging catchy melodies and feel good production with angry distortion, wailing feedback, gloomy riffs, and thundering rhythms that seemed to emanate from the very depths of hell.  Even the low key Planet Caravan exudes a vaguely menacing tone with its creepy effected vocals.  While some took exception to their choice of subject matter (war, drugs, mental illness), their music fit the material, was like nothing before, and couldn't be ignored.  It's no overstatement to say that metal music owes its direction, if not its existence, in significant measure to Black Sabbath in general, and to Paranoid in particular which exemplified the possibilities and was the first flagship for all who dared to follow.
B000P2A256|5.0|This album is really great, I can't stop listening to it!  Cheers to Maroon 5 for making an amazing album.
B00008S7ZW|5.0|I had obviously been on another planet where we never watched Friends so The Good Girl was the first time I ever saw Jennifer Aniston and she blew me away.  This dark comedy has a quirky but believable plot and a wonderful supporting cast-Tim Blake Nelson, John C. Reilly and a young, dreamy-eyed Jake Gyllenhaal.  The film's director even has a bit part as an evangelical security guard.<br /><br />Anniston is Justine-a small town, working class everywoman trapped in a dead-end marriage to a stoner house painter husband wonderfully played by Reilly.  The brilliant Nelson portrays his workmate Buddy who is a very chilling blackmailer.  Justine works at a mundane job and  there she ill-advisedly becomes sexually involved with Holden (Gyllenhaal), a disturbed young man who calls himself after the protagonist of Catcher in the Rye which he reads obsessively.<br /><br />Bless her heart, Justine is basically \\"a good girl\\" who makes some pretty poor choices all around while trying to please everyone but herself.  Her character is so appealing that you want root for her even when she is screwing up.  Best of all is the satisfying ending that I really didn't see coming.
B000NVIXDW|5.0|I really enjoyed listening to this CD.  Michael Buble's music is very easy listening, and he has a fantastic orchestra behind him.  It's wonderful to listen to a young man, with a very pleasant voice, sing the older standards. It's also nice to be able to understand every word a singer sings nowadays.  I'm old enough to be his grandmother, but I'm an avid fan of his.  I'll certainly buy any CD he makes.
1582701709|5.0|I loved this book.  I plan to re-read it and to purchase the movie to watch.
B0006OBPTA|5.0|if you have never seen karate kid, part of your life is missing.  just kidding.  that's going a little far, but it is a a great set.  the third wasn't as good as the first two though.  the 4th, with hilary, is good, too.
0439813786|4.0|An artist friend recommended this book and when I arrived, I thought, boy this is thick.  However 1/2 of the book is illustrations which tell and support the story.  The art is black and white, pencil, I think, and in the spirit of the story.  It's recommended for 9 years and up, and although I am an adult, it was enjoyable, well written, holding my interest and quite sweet and lovely.  I think a mature 9 year old would enjoy it, but may have trouble holding the book unless he were sitting at a desk or table.  Contents are age appropriate.
B000LAZDQA|5.0|I saw Shortbus at the theater when released and had to buy the DVD.  It is a singular film in that it has successfully (like no other film) married graphic sexual content with an interesting plot.  If you have not yet seen the film be warned - it opens with some of the most startling images you will likely ever see in a widely distributed film - you will chuckle, and you may squirm and blush.  You may do some of the things depicted, or maybe only wish you did; some may be a bit repulsed by some of the content.  But one thing is for certain - the film will leave some impression on you.
B000O178BY|4.0|Ive been a fan of NIN for years and I own and listen every song on their LP. I can admit NIN (Trent) is one of the best band and artist on earth because he can combine rock and electronic sound in a harmony. Unfortunately, I wont be able to see NIN live show, because most people in my country dont know about a great band like NIN. They much prefer in a pop rock band like hoobastank, saosin, muse, good charlotte, etc. So I really understand why NIN wont put my country in their tour list. I can only watch their live performance from and all that could have been and beside you in time. In my country there is only a few NIN LP, so I must be very lucky to able to collect all of them. Because of it, I always think NIN LP as a precious collection. I listen every song thoroughly and try to understand the meaning on it.  YZ is my first NIN LP come from USA, my others LP come from Europe. The first time, I heard the whole LP, I feel disappointed because NIN have gone so far from their root. But I keep listening it for 3 days and then I realize this album is really awesome. It isnt so noisy like TDS but not to light like WT. I think YZ, musicaly more like Pretty Hate Machine, but has the feeling of WT. What I really appreciate, YZ is very conceptual just like What Trent said. I dont play the advertising game, but I have read the whole story of it. After I can enjoy YZ, I feel YZ is like a fiction novel in the form of music. In my oppinion, YZ is really awesome LP if you listen it from track 1 up to 16 and not skip any track between it because you can see the whole picture of YZ.    Beside all of that, I am a bit disappointed because YZ doesnt include any noizy song like March of the Pig and  a bit repetitive drum pattern like in My Violent Heart, Zero Sum. But all of that doesnt prevent me to enjoy YZ.    In YZ, we can also notice that TR begin to grow up. He is sober and doesnt use old theme like drug, self destruction too much and glad of it. Sadly, he still cant see thepotential in other musician when making an album. In my oppinion, his current tour members are talented musicians. I hope Trent will take any of them other than Josh just like when he made the Fragile.    In the end, I recommended this LP for old NIN fans who familiar with NIN style because you can see the transformation in NIN. For a new fan, it is better to take previous NIN album first so you can understand NIN better. The quickest way to do this is listen to and all that could have been CD or DVD (the DVD DTS version is what I really recommended).
0743550927|5.0|I was given a audio copy of this book, I wasn't sure if it was something I would enjoy but I ended up loving the story.  I love that the story was narrated by Frank McCourt himself with his Irish accent.  The fact that you can feel his feelings as he reads his own story it makes it so real.  I could almost see him at times on the lane he lived on.  I felt for him and everything he want through but I love his perseverance to make it even after his near death experiences.  He still went on to make something of himself.  I am looking forward to \\"Tis\\"
B000OCXFCO|5.0|After all these artists making cds about how bush sucks or the war sucks or republicans suck, there is finally an artist willing to put out a cd that exposes the idiots (being the UN) for who they are.  The people that are giving this cd bad reveiws are just the morons who can't bear to see a cd exposing the UN for what it is.  And don't think I just like it because of my political veiws, there are hard core solos and powerful riffs in there that are rarely seen in this day and age with the stupid punk rock bands that are out there and don't know anything besides power chords.  BUY THIS CD!!!
0385335482|5.0|THIS BOOK WAS REALLY FUNNY AND I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!
B000O5AYCA|4.0|I really like this the music is really good. The only problem is that i cant understand the singer's words he tends to mumbles that is why i have to listen to it again. But it is a nice change of pace to have a singer that does not break into falseto every second. I plan to buy this. If you want to listen to this for free to see if you like it go to aol music listen party. I was looking on there and i put it on by accident i meant to push the new Rufus Wainwright who i have no desire of buying eventhough i like him. I much rather get this which is different it sounds like a better version of Arcade fire.
159562015X|3.0|At the age of 35, I thought that this book could help me hone in on specific strengths to assist me in developing a plan for a career change.  While the book may be useful for someone right out of college, I thought that the themes identified were too general.  They are attributes that anyone who is even mildly reflective would already know about him/herself.   For example, output included statements like \\"you are stimulated by learning and should be engaged in work where you are given an opportunity to learn new things.\\"  Of course I already know this because I answered about 5 questions confirming that I like to learn!    Perhaps if the program gave more examples of ways in which these strengths could be applied, it would be more useful for someone like me.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Wonderfully filmed and very engaging. This is cinematography at its best--at the service of learning. I prefer the British narration.
B000P2A256|5.0|I love this album, and it's been on repeat since I bought it. I know some people are disappointed with this new collection of songs and they were looking for \\"More Songs About Jane\\" but one thing I've learned about Maroon 5 is that they've got balls to always be experimenting and integrating new styles and concepts. So, put your biases aside for any style of music and sit and listen to this album. You just can't compare it to their first album because the guys are always changing and integrating new stuff into the mix. If you've got a great appreciation for all kinds of music, you'll love what M5 has brought to the table with their sophomore effort.     My only complaint would be that the album seems a bit overproduced and not as raw-sounding as their last album, but with the band's new-found financial security, it's no suprrise that they shelled out the extra cash to create a more polished and refined album. But here's the solution: See them live and then you'll know these guys are for real!     I give the album a 9.5/10, and it's definitely worth every penny!
B000002H5I|1.0|'Fast car' was a remarkable single for it's time. We all talked ourselves into the rest of the filler on this cd, about which the best you can say is it's all extraordinarily average. If however art to you is didacticism, you will be in heaven. This has twee rhetorical questions (\\"Why are the missiles called Peacekeepers?\\"), exhausted imagery (I know somewhere in here a baby is crying) and worst of all an acapella sermon. All it lacks it some sort of \\"Save the bunnies\\" track. All of this gets filtered through Chapman's self-annointed \\"nobler than thou\\" suffering and humorless delivery, and of course that ridiculous all-purpose quaver. She doesn't exactly deliver a message subtly. Oh Tracy, won't you be my conscience?<br /><br />This schtick had no future and noone bought her follow-up C.D.. But this garbage is still being pushed on us by \\"enlightened\\" radio stations, and I still hear the lesser songs from this cd all the time. It's a shame. I HATE these songs. To paraphrase the movie Bull Durham, \\"Aw, Tracy Chapman is as full of cr*p as anyone.\\" You wouldn't know it from all of this unbearable condescension. I think her dream job would involve a cleric's collar and a pulpit.<br /><br />Some liberals feel that music is just another place to be a drag. (And these remarks are coming from a massive liberal!) I don't subscribe to that hogwash. 10,000 maniacs, Midnight Oil and Tracy Chapman are the bottom of the barrell; a very humorless barrell.<br /><br />This CD is an unrefined brow-beating.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is a fascinating series to own.  It is a great companion to the Blue Planet series.  The locations, animals and plants are simply amazing.  The photography is superb.  The BBC has done another great job.
B000JLTRIG|4.0|I have been a loyal Charmed Fan since the very beginning however, Season 7 was in my opinion the worst season for writing. However, if you just now getting into Charmed even though it is off the air this is a must have for Charmed Fans. I just didn't like the storylines this season and was extremely happy that it was renewed for an 8th season. The first attempt at a season finale was a very poor one. Leo has his own storylines this season which was wonderful though especially for Leo Fans.
B000002J1O|5.0|Not much to say about this album - you HAVE to listen to it youreself. <br /> <br />Surfice it to say that i have been listening to this masterpiece for over 20 years now and i always get something new out of it everytime i hear it, and thats at least 3 times a week. <br /> <br />This music makes the hair on the back of my neck stand on end and brings tears to my eye with its sheer beauty, and the pleasure it gives me.  No other album has ever had such an emotional effect on me.   <br /> <br />Give it a try - it is sublime!
B000OCXMAE|5.0|Linkin Park's latest album is an intentional departure from their older sound. At least...they try to be different. Even with all the changes, it still has that LP flavor. Wether thats good, bad, or intentional, its up to you. Maybe they just cant shake it off. <br /> <br />Personaly, I LOVE this album but only after listening to it a few times. Its definitely strange to hear LP with this newer sound, but when you start listening to how their instruments are more vivid (particularly guitars) and their lyrics are more deep, youll see how good it is. Its a great mix of frenetic songs, slow songs, meaningful songs, fun songs, rap, rock, mellow and serious. <br /> <br />1: Wake - Basically the Intro...didnt really care. <br />2: Given Up - A very solid metal feeling song. Fast beats, very fun, very older LP sound.  <br />3: Leave Out All The Rest - One of my favorite songs on this album. Good lyrics. Very gentle and mellow.  <br />4: Bleed It Out - Good lyrics. Very fast and fun, heavy rapping, very \\"Live-sounding\\" song. <br />5: Shadow Of The Day - This song is very \\"U2\\" sounding. The bassline is very good. Its one of the slower songs. The lyrics are excellent. <br />6: What I've Done - This is the single that you probably hear on the radio. Its ok, but its not the strongest song on this album. The techno sounds just feel out of place. <br />7: Hands Held High - This is purely a rap piece, very political. Its nice to hear LP try and have a nice message other than Angst/Emo/Anger in their songs. <br />8: No More Sorrow - The intro is awesome on this song. Its another very metal piece. Great sounds, another very \\"old LP\\" song. Weak lyrics. <br />9: Valentine's Day - Simply the best song on the album. The lyrics are top notch. The progression and build up is great. Its just. Wow. They better release this as a single. <br />10: In Between - I really tried to like this song, but its too much build up with no real resolution. Its a major downer for me. <br />11: In Pieces -Chester sounds a little hollow on this song, but the lyrics are great, it builds up nicely, its got an excellent guitar solo, the synth and the drums are awesome. <br />12: The Little Things Give You Away - Nice instruments on this song. It sounds kind of \\"Folk Rock\\"-ish actually. The lyrics seem to be a direct commentary on Hurricane Katrina. It also has a waltzy beat.
B000KX0IOK|4.0|Half Nelson is not the most original movie of it's kind dealing with drugs, intergenerational/inter-racial friendship, and spiritual redemption/recovery. It's a very strong movie and captivating in it's own way, because it focuses on character and performances more than plotline. At times, it's feels kind of documentary-like. I must say there is also heartbreaking moments during the scenes when Ryan Gosling's teacher character abusing crack in the school's women's washroom and being rescued by Shareeka Epps(his student) when he was on the verge of overdosing himself. The performances by Gosling and Epps were so real and memsmerizing. Gosling is very convincing with his overall portrayal of a school teacher trying to hide his addiction while struggling to quit at the same time. I think it's certainly a good movie in a way that it's very educational and inspirational to the audiences who have been in those two characters' shoes. This film has it's shocking moments such as the one when Epps became involved and witnessed the drug afflicted party scene in a motel room, and that she was even developing an attraction to her teacher(Gosling). So yes, it was entirely convincing that Gosling's performance in this film was worthy of his Oscar nomination, and IMO he's the best Canadian actor of his generation!
B000O174CM|5.0|I was very happy and impressed when I saw Dreamgirl on Christmas! At first I thought there were going to try to show no body but Beyonce'but I was wrong, everyone in the movie did an excellent job and Jennifer Hudson, I think the Oscar spoke for itself. She gave me goose bumps with her voice and her acting wasn't so bad either. I also loved Anika in her role at Lorrell she did a good job too. If you like the Five Heatbeats, The Temptation, Little Richard, Sparkle, or Ray, this is the movie for you full of African American talent!!!!
B00005ASHM|5.0|This album would be Earth's best attempt to copy it. There are so many different sounds to this album that are a joy to discover. I particularly like the mono recordings, even though I first heard the stereo recordings. If you are going to buy this album, buy the album that has both recordings on it and have fun comparing the different tracks. As far as the Sgt. Pepper/Pet Sounds dispute I only would say that there is a major difference between the sounds of Revolver and Sgt. Pepper - and the album that bridges that divide is Pet Sounds. Stop comparing the two and enjoy them for what they are. Personally, I dig Pet Sounds more because there seems to be a terrific spirit revolving around the album, which is something that I don't really get from the later Beatles Albums (even though they are my favorite group.)
B000H5V8DG|5.0|Although I don't care too much for the Rambaldi Box - the entire series from Amazon was a great price. This was an awesome show, and anyone who liked it - should have this in their personal collection!!
0812971825|3.0|I came away from a long read of 'The Terror' looking for something light and ran across 'Abide with Me' in the book store. I admit it was the cover that caught my eye of the sad little girl. This book was exactly what I expected. It was an easy read set in a somewhat depressing time about a minister and his daughter and what happens after his wife dies. I was a little let down that the issues with the daughter were not more played out and came to a tidy end after one converstation between them. The author seemed to hint at some sexual abuse between the wife's father and her sister and perhaps even her friends but that too was never made clear so we were left to wonder if this was what played into the wife's kleptomaniac/shallow/self centered personality. Still a very good read that I looked forward to picking up everyday and reading.
075640407X|5.0|The Name of the Wind is poetic in is writing, sweeping in is vision and truly devoted to its characters. It's a little slow in the beginning, but if you let it, the slow methodical pace will reach out and wrap itself around you and will not let go until the last page is turned.     Its wonderful to read a story that does not cling to the \\"fantasy stereotypes\\" or if it does take on an aspect of them, it does not invoke the feelings that usually accompany such drivel. For example, even though the main character is a youthful orphan he does not inspire the  \\"ye gods, not another callow youth\\" feeling, instead he makes you want to weep for his failures and smile as he finds exceptionally clever ways to piss off authority.      I absolutely love the fact that in this first story there is no real antagonist except life itself and the hardship that come by simply being human.  The Name of the Wind is a breath of fresh air and I am so happy that I stumbled across it.
B000AM2L1O|5.0|What a sweet little doll.  Although, I really don't think this doll measures 12 inches, more like eight or nine, my 3-year-old daughter loves her.  She is the perfect little doll for her to carry around, sing to sleep and take care of.  My daughter loves her.  And, it is so wonderful that she smells lightly of vanilla.  Not overwhelming or overpowering at all.  Just a wonderful doll.  I am going to buy her another corolle doll next, the bigger size.
B000O77RLE|4.0|Clint Eastwood does it again.  A great film showing the true horrors of war.  I haven't seen Flags of Our Father's, so i can't comment which film is better, but I was thouroughlly engrossed for the full 2 hours and 15 minutes of this film.  Tha acting is one of the best I've seen, from the main characters to the supporting was truly top notch.  I also found the screenplay and the cinematography excellent.  The only downfall was the transfer to Blu-ray.  I understand that the film was shot in almost a muted gray color, almost close to B/W, but there were scenes where the black level and gray were very \\"blotchy\\" and almost smearing on screen.  Sorry, i am not familiar with the right terminology, but you'll know when you see it.  I'll be surprised whether the regular dvd transfer has the same problem.  Other than that, this is one film that will be a keeper!

B000P6YNSE|5.0|Warning!  Major spoiler alert!<br /><br />I believe that Season Three of LOST is one of those seasons of a show that will have a significant impact on the dynamics of television quite apart from the merits or demerits of the season itself.  This is mainly due to various tensions the networks have had in broadcasting serial dramas.  Season Two of LOST provoked vast viewer anger over the seemingly endless repeats.  All season long they would give us four or five new episodes, only to do three or four repeats.  No one knew sometimes if they would be tuning into a repeat or a new episode.  To counter this, ABC made the decision to broadcast six episodes in the fall to be followed by sixteen episodes shown without interruption beginning in January.  Unfortunately, the six episodes they showed in the fall were almost universally perceived as the weakest group of episodes in the show's run.  The results of all this I think will be threefold:<br /><br />1.  In the future, I think the trend with popular serial dramas will be to broadcast shows in uninterrupted hunks.  We had already seen this happening with 24.  I think after the Season Three debacle with LOST, which saw the show lose a huge number of viewers during its break, this will become far more commonplace.<br /><br />2.  The general perception of the first six episodes of the season was that they dawdled too much, provided too little plot development, and simply didn't advance the narrative sufficiently.  Shows tend to learn from the mistakes and failures of other series.  Damon Lindelhof of LOST has stated that the writers on the show have attempted to avoid the piling up of mysteries that occurred on TWIN PEAKS and the lack of focus on character rather than plot on THE X-FILES and to emulate the focus on character within the overall narrative that was seen in BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER.  I believe in the future that writers on other serial narratives will strive to make sure that the mysteries on a show are being revealed at a good pace.  (Just as I think future writers will try to emulate the pace at which this has been done on BATTLESTAR GALACTICA.)<br /><br />3.  There was also a widespread perception that in much of Season Two of LOST and the first six episodes of Season Three, the overall narrative was simply being padded out to ensure a long run for the show.  From the beginning looked like a show that needed fewer rather than more seasons to be truly good, but it appeared that with the ratings monster it was in the first two seasons that the powers that be were hoping they could stretch it out to seven or eight seasons instead of five or six.  Luckily, the huge backlash against the show following the first six episodes--a backlash that occurred both among everyday fans and among TV critics--seems to have created a reassessment and in the spring it was announced that LOST would be back for three more sixteen-episode seasons.  I was delighted with how positively this announcement was greeted by fans and critics alike.  I think the result has been for the networks to recognize that certain kinds of series have only a limited potential in terms of the number of episodes that can be produced, that there are certain series that you can really only produce if you anticipate their going four or five or at most six seasons.  The other series this is happening with is BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, which like LOST is more or less telling a single story.  Both of these are outstanding series that will benefit from a smaller number of series (the debate among the producers of BSG at the moment is whether they need to end the series at the end of Season Four or whether they will need a Season Five).  As a negative example there is PRISON BREAK, which currently is threatening to fall apart for lack of any real plan.<br /><br />The great news about Season Three is that after the long break the show came back as good as ever.  If we were rating this as one would rate an ice skater, we'd have togive it a lower rating based on some slips and falls early in its routine.  But it rebounded wonderfully and the frustration that most viewers experienced in the fall rarely if ever returned in the spring.  Furthermore, they started giving us concrete answers to a host of questions that had been bothering us for ages.  We found out all about the others (though not where they originally came from), about the lay out of the island, about the facilities on the island, and a few of -- though by no means all of -- the island's secrets.  At the end of the season there were still things we'd like to know about -- Just who is Jacob?  What's up with the black smoke?  What makes the island so special? What was the genesis of the Dharma Initiative -- but there is no doubt that we knew vastly more than we knew before.  There were also many new characters.  Ben, whom we knew in Season Two as Henry, was back and became one of the most fascinating characters on the show.  And we were introduced to the enigmatic Juliet, whose sad and wistful smile was as impossible to comprehend as the Mona Lisa's.  We learned that following the decimation of the hatch at the end of Season Two Desmond experienced visions of the future and seemed doomed to reenacting events.  The deep attraction between Jack and Kate was made more explicit even though she ends up furthering things with Sawyer.  And as many fans suspected as early as Season One, Locke's father turned out to be the real Sawyer.  Our Sawyer coming face-to-face with the real Sawyer was not only one of the highlights of the season but of the entire series.<br /><br />I want to say something about the finale, but without giving away the details of how the last five minutes of the season changes absolutely everything we know about the series.  The changes are, interestingly, not so much in new revelations as in ways that are open for the show to proceed narratively in the future.  For the past three seasons the narrative has proceeded in the present with flashbacks to the past of various characters.  That is no longer possible.  In the future the narrative will of necessity either proceed on the island with flash forwards or will take place in the future with flashbacks to events following the end of Season Three.  (Sorry to be vague here, but I really think that one should watch Season Three without knowing what happens at the end of the season to change everything so completely.)  I honestly have no idea what way they will proceed.  If I had to bet, I would say that the show will continue to use flashbacks, but that the main narrative will proceed in the present.  The first three seasons took place pretty much exclusively in the calendar year 2004.  I believe Season Four could well take place in 2008 with flashbacks to the previous four years.  Regardless, the surprising ending changed everything.<br /><br />There is one beef I want to make with the show.  As much as I love this series, it has to handle the death of characters worse than just about any I have seen.  The first series to kill off a substantial number of central and beloved characters was BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER.  There had been other deaths on television series, to be sure.  The death of Deep Throat at the end of the first season of THE X-FILES was close to unprecedented at the time.  Previously characters largely died because they wanted to leave a show, like the death of Edith on ALL IN THE FAMILY or Denise Crosby's departure from STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION.  But BUFFY created the habit of killing off key characters.  I'm not sure I've ever been so completely shocked at the death of any character on TV as I was when Angel killed Jenny Calendar in Season Two of BUFFY.  It shattered the hallowed tradition on TV that you simply don't kill off characters you like.  It ushered in a new era on TV to great effect.  Suddenly, a new sense of danger was introduced to TV.  Before you always knew that all the characters would survive anycatastrophe, no matter how dire, simply because that was the nature of TV.  But after BUFFY and the way that other series so quickly picked up on its willingness to kill characters, a new sense of precariousness extended to almost every show on TV.  And TV was certainly the better for it.  One thing that made the deaths on BUFFY so compelling was that each one carried such a great price and had such enormous consequences.  All the deaths were exceedingly well done.  But this has not been the case on LOST.  Perhaps the deaths will be made less meaningless by developments in the final three seasons, though I somehow doubt it.  Characters were killed off in almost random fashion.  At least there was no real sense about why they were killed off.  It seems like someone said, \\"Well, we need to kill someone off.\\"  And some of the deaths seemed to be caused by off screen activities.  Michelle Rodgriguez's death in Season Two was thought by many to be in response to a violation of probation that might have required some jail time and impinged on the shooting schedule (she claims she only signed up for one season).  In Season Three Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje's great character Mr. Eko was killed reportedly because he was hated by all his fellow cast members and he hated them all in return (some anonymous cast members reported that he was dictatorial to the extent of telling other actors what they should do or how to speak their lines--all reports are that no one was sad to see him leave the set).  But even so his death felt like he had been ripped from the show prematurely.  And a major death in the season finale felt equally unnecessary.  I believe that this will also influence future shows.  I think \\"the body count\\" is a permanent fixture in any series with an adventure element, but I think that future shows will strive not to make the death of characters as superfluous as they have been in LOST.<br /><br />The final three seasons will all begin in the winter and be broadcast for sixteen straight weeks with no interruptions.  I love this not merely because it means no dead times between episodes but because it puts definite limits on how much time they have left to finish the story.  I think most fans of the show feel a lot better about how things are going now than they did last fall.  Then the series seemed moribund and seemed almost to be drifting.  Now it feels like it is heading somewhere definite.  And it ended the season by doing something that all the really great shows do:  it took a gigantic risk that changes everything.  I look forward with excitement to what happens next.us characters.  That is no longer possible.

B0002XVQNU|5.0|I enjoyed both versions of Daredevil, but this one is longer and better, with even more action and is darker. One of the best superhero movies out there.
0142000663|1.0|I have read many books in my time, and this not one of them. I have \\"picked\\" this book out of the library countless times and have never read it. Despite this, I feel that this book should be counted among the greatest books of our time. While I personally deplore Mr.Steinbeck and his mop people, this book is so wonderful that I can overlook my feelings and say \\"Whozaa!\\" and \\"Hallelujah\\". Anyone who looks at the pictures in this book and is not brought to tears is truly without feeling. My only issue with this marvelous piece of literature is that it is not longer. I could look at pictures forever.
B000PT6OY2|5.0|Be careful reading too many reviews on this movie.  Honestly, I missed Casino Royale in theaters even though I planned to see it, and after having rented it here I wish I had made it to the theater!   <br /> <br />For loyal 007 fans, you will like how Craig takes on the Bond role, and how he adds his personal flair.  The series had gotten too comical with recent movies, not necessarily with Brosnan playing Bond, but with plotlines, and Craig takes the character to new directions.  I'd say new, but more likely how Ian Fleming had originally intended.   <br /> <br />If you are on-the-fence, rent it.  If you don't care for Bond movies but enjoy action-thrillers, rent it.  If you're looking for an unpredictable movie with lots of twists, rent it.  You won't be disappointed.

B00005JM02|5.0|One film that will truly have you asking, \\"how'd they do that?\\" Disney/Pixar at there very best. Nemo is the only surviving hatchling of one Clownfish couple's clutch of eggs. With the unsuccessful heroism of his mother, he and his father are all that's left of their little family. But Nemo is taken captive by a diver, and his father Marlin is forced to embark on a perilous ocean adventure, in search of him. There is so much rich and colorful detail in the surrounding ocean scenes, you'd swear it was the real thing. And I'm still not convinced that it isn't! Marlin soon encounters the extremely daffy Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), at her funniest. And I've never really considered her all that humorous.    From migrating sea turtles, to wacky aquarium inhabitants, nothing goes wrong here for laughs. And those crazy seagulls nearly steal the entire show. Mine!...Mine!...Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!     Oh, and Nemo? Of course the ending is all good. But we won't spoil that for the very few that have never seen it.
6301969251|3.0|If you follow my reviews, you know that I see Franco Zeffirelli's \\"Jesus of Nazareth\\" (1977) as the best movie about Jesus. This earlier version with Max Von Sydow as Jesus falls short in several ways. (It lacks the deep character development, a lot of the educated speculation, as well as the artistic beauty of \\"Jesus of Nazareth.\\") Well, that said, this earlier version is not bad considering that it was made over a decade earlier. And there are some things that make this 2nd best version worth watching. (2nd Best isn't always so bad.) The first interesting thing is when Herod orders the killing of the children (in an attempt to kill Jesus early). Herod himself actually quotes \\"Jeremiah\\" 31:15. (See \\"Matthew\\" 2:16-18.) Thus the movie underlines that there IS such a thing as a conscious and deliberate attempt to fulfill a prophecy. Or for that matter, making our own ends coincide with a prophecy that has been sitting around for some time. Telly Savalas gives an interesting picture of Pilate. He simply wants to keep order. In his book \\"The Killing,\\" Bishop Richard Holloway explains that Pilate was really no worse than anyone else who would have had that job. (Side note: For the record, Pilate has been the procurator for some time before the trial of Christ, and by the time Christ's trial came, Pilate was getting tired of his office.) Another interesting 'artistic liberty' taken is that Mary Magdalene meets Jesus when she is almost stoned for adultery. (See \\"John\\" 8:3-11.) Thus we see that one can go from a sinner to a saint. Also, Jesus tells the wealthy Lazarus some painful truths about wealth that upset him. But later Jesus raises Lazarus from the dead. Thus we see that Jesus loves us even though we have our shortcomings. Another interesting thing is that when Jesus casts out the changers from the temple (See \\"Matthew\\" 21:12-13), he explains that burnt offerings are NOT what God desires. To be sure, this movie does not have the memorable beauty of \\"Jesus of Nazareth.\\" But Max Von Sydow actually does the role quite well. Granted, when there are several movie versions of one story, we usually have our favorites. But often, other versions do have interesting things to offer. Even if (as in my case) Robert Powell will always be Jesus to you, it won't hurt to give this version a chance..\\" But Max Von Sydow actually does the role quite well.

B00005QZ7U|5.0|I did not go to see this movie when it was in the theaters.  So when it was shown on TV last month I watched it and fell in love with it.  I'm sure this movie does not appeal to everyone but I think it's great.  I think the casting is right on.  The music is fabulous.  The look of the movie is colorful and fun to watch. I bought the DVD and watch this movie over and over.  I never tire of it!
B000N6TX1I|5.0|This is a beautifully crafted, powerful and resonant film. Viewers looking for a conventional action or science fiction film will be disappointed, because \\"Children of Men\\" has much more of the spirit of an art film. In fact, each scene of the film, instead of being filled with CGI, is composed like a provocative painting. (In this manner it recalls another dystopian masterpiece \\"A Clockwork Orange\\".) The story itself revolves around the theme of hope. In a future where no children are being born, human life has been reduced to a mixture of despair, violence and empty pleasure-seeking. When a pregnant woman is discovered for the first time in 18 years, she becomes both a beacon of hope and a pawn in the political agendas of various societal elements.<br /><br />My friends who watched this film with me didn't like the film's open, anti-climactic ending. I thought it suited the film perfectly. Bravo.
B00005V9IJ|5.0|An extremely dedicated FedEx man finds his whole reason for being, totally interrupted in a matter of minutes. With one of the best and most believable crash sequences ever put on film, were gone the love-of-his-life and his career. In no particular order. Tom Hank's characters always seem to pull the audience in, making us care about what happens to them. The sounds of being stranded on a desert island, waves hitting the sand, give that sense of realism and feeling all alone. Great effort from the sound effects crew. And after too many years in isolation, he pretty much loses it with the loss of his one companion \\"Wilson\\".     I guess the one complaint expressed by many, not myself, was the even bigger disappointment he suffered after returning to civilization. Extremely touching, with the falling rain a symbol of the many years of tears and separation. But there is also the positive side. An ending with the hope of a new beginning.     A film I can watch over-and-over again. Once again, a brilliant collaboration for actor Tom Hanks and director Robert Zemeckis.
B000MV9026|1.0|There is very little further criticism that I can give this movie that hasn't already been said in the previously posted negative reviews.  I watched it on a trans-atlantic flight and I have to say that the leg cramping and constant up and down to allow my neighbor to exit were more entertaining and a better use of my time.  As a positive reviewer said - it's a kid's movie.  I agree if only because I'd hate to think anyone with greater than a third grade education would be entertained by this.  Many writers and producers of children's movies have managed to make them entertaining for both children and adults, a skill in which Pixar leads the way.  Alas, this is not a Pixar film.  The only thing of comprable quality is the animation and there's only so much time that will buy when nothing else is worthy of note.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|After a four year absence, Linkin Park has decided to deviate from their musical formula.  The rap/rock combination of the previous two LPs, Hybrid Theory and Meteora, is almost completely eliminated.  This album marks a substantial transformation in Linkin Park's career as musicians.  Consequently, I do not believe the sound is as defined as on the previous two albums, and I also find it unlikely the album will see as well as they did.  Nevertheless, Minutes to Midnight has several notable strengths.  This is the first album, in my opinion, that demonstrates Linkin Park's versatility as musicians.  \\"Given Up\\" and \\"No More Sorrow\\" show that Linkin Park is still willing put in some doses of hard rock, while \\"Shadow of the Day\\" and \\"Valentine's Day\\" demonstrate a level of harmony only found on one track in the last two albums:  \\"Breaking the Habit.\\"  \\"The Little Things Give You Away\\" concludes the album with an epic, emotional 6+ minute track that is drastically different from anything Linkin Park has ever made before.  Of course, several tracks on the album seem virtually unclassifiable.  \\"In Pieces\\" features both a techno beat and a guitar solo.  \\"Bleed It Out\\" seems more in the rap/rock vein than any other track but is far more light-hearted than previous Linkin Park efforts.  And \\"Hand Helds High\\" is perhaps the best track on the album:  Mike raps about the war in Iraq and produces perhaps the best lyrics of any Linkin Park song to date. <br /> <br />Overall, Minutes to Midnight may not be better than either of the previous two albums, but it is certainly the most unique album they have produced.  The variety of sound almost guarantees that anyone can find a few tracks that they enjoy.  Die-hard Linkin Park fans are not likely to eat this album up like the other two, but it still has much to offer.  Additionally, this album opens the door for a ground-breaking fourth album, which, given the proper time and energy, could easily surpass the previous three.
B000OCXMAE|1.0|No offence, but really this not linkin park.. I still can't believe that the greatest rock band in the whole world would produce such a pile of garbage..    This is absolutely a fake linkin park.. They used to amaze me with their abillity to dig so deep in my mind and scratrch my own personal problems with their great, rap/hard-rocking, meaningfull, and also (((clean))) lyrics, without having to use such a nasty word like the \\"F*\\" word..    Personally, I think that bad language was one of the main causes of their failure with this new release..  However everything about this release was just plain \\"H.O.R.R.I.B.LE\\"..!    Me, and my friends (the ones who also love linkin park) are pretending as if LP didn't make a new release yet, and hopefully, to see the REAL Linkin Park come out with a new release to sweep this BIG pile of garbage away..!!
B000O178BY|5.0|I havent even listened to NiN before and after listening to this cd, I'm hooked.  The lyrics are extremely deep and meaningful, and if you are or not a NiN fan, pick this cd up, you will love it.  I have listened to all of this cd on repeat for 4 days and I cant get enough of it.  After reading a little about Trent Reznor and comparing this cd to his others, this is definitely his best at the moment. <br /> <br />Pick this up, you wont regret it.
B0001HAHXW|2.0|There is little doubt that Clapton is a living legend having made considerable contributions to blues-based popular music.  Unfortunately, \\"Me and Mr. Johnson\\" is not that considerable.  With an all star cast of musicians (Andy Fairweather-Low, Billy Preston, Nathan East, and Steve Gadd) this disc offers the listener tweaked and polished interpretations of almost half of the legendary blues man's existing repertoire.  However, what the album offers in terms of production it certainly lacks in feeling.  Some other reviews have used the term \\"elevator music\\" to describe the recording, but \\"karaoke\\" would be a better term.  There is little to convince you that this is distinctly Clapton playing a heartfelt blues classic rather than an average Joe reading the lyrics off a television monitor in a smoky bar somewhere.  Upbeat numbers such as \\"They're Red Hot\\" fare much better than tortured tracks such as \\"Hell Hound On My Trail,\\" which comes across more like an angry weenie dog snapping at his heels.    While the album may serve as an introduction to early blues music for new listeners, Clapton's \\"From The Cradle,\\" \\"Riding With The King,\\" and even his \\"MTV Unplugged\\" are much more representative of his talent as an interpreter of the blues.  Both Rolling Stone and Entertainment Weekly gave this record a good review, but just because he is already a legend doesn't warrant the rubber stamp of approval from even the most die hard of fans in my opinion.  I would suggest checking out the albums mentioned above if you are interested in Clapton and/or a bridge to the blues genre.    On a last note, beware that this CD is copy protected, which may cause some problems if you would like to convert the songs to a digital device such as an I-Pod or mp3 player.  Just another way of making it more difficult for the honest consumer rather than serving as a true deterrent of piracy.
B000P0J02E|5.0|I'm a huge Zimmer fan. I believe my favorite of his scores has been GLADIATOR -- until now. This is an incredibly fun, unique score that avoids all the \\"sequel\\" pitfalls. From the unique, \\"Hoist the Colors,\\" to the Mozart-ish \\"Calypso,\\" with a orchestra runs through a series of ascending scales as the choir accompanies, all the way to the grand finale, \\"Drink Up Me Hearties,\\" this score is not to be missed.    The classical composers of old -- Mozart, Beethoven, Bach, etc. -- would be proud of Zimmer's work, and they would be simply have to say, \\"Well done!\\"    Kudos, Mr. Zimmer!
B00012FXB8|4.0|I have this as part of the huge boxset but I wanted to adress this film seperatly. I know this was not very widely accepted when it was released and it had alot of bad marks long before it was released. First it followed the hugely successfull Aliens which was more of an action film than suspense/terror like Alien. Second it had a \\"virgin\\" director, and was marred by production difficulties and rumors of Ripley's demise b/c of the then rumored Alien VS. Predator movie which she wanted nothing to do with. I have seen many complaints raging from bad acting, bad special effects, poor direction etc. First I first saw this on VHS as a teenager as well as the others and fell in love with them but I found as I have aged I like it even more. The acting was superb from all involved. My only gripe was the massive use of the \\"F\\" word but ultimatly acceptable since it was set in a prison. As to the effects it was tricky from the get go. Deciding to use a different style alien, more of a hunter who cares nothing about preserving the body, than the Aliens we had seen before. Animitronics and CG were heavily used in this instead of a guy in a suit. CG was just in it's infancy back then. It was ubsurdly expensive and as with most movies of that era, is very noticable. I'd hardly call it crappy. In todays world it would be but same could be said of some of the effects in the other two alien movies. No CG aliens were used b/c of guys in suits. I feel the film was a bit slow going but very enjoyable. It was a similar feel to Alien and IMO a very enjoyable movie. The special edition offers a extended version with about 30 minutes added and IMO it adds more depth to the story. A good film has turned into a great film with the added footage. The only issue is after all this time the audio degraded on some of the unused footage but isnt that bad. Only twow spots are really bad. I recomend this movie to any Alien fan. IMO it is indeed a great movie.

0345479092|1.0|I read Secrets of The Baby Whisperer several months before giving birth.  When I tried to follow the advice, I couldn't make any of it work.  EASY is not easy at all, and in fact, if your baby falls asleep right after eating...let him/her do it!  Don't try to keep him awake with an \\"activity\\".  That's just crazy, even if you redefine activity to mean \\"staring into space wanting to sleep\\".<br /><br />Also, baby cries are not distinguishable in the way Ms. Hogg claims.  Her descriptions of hungry and tired cries did not line up with my experience.  Other mothers may have better luck with this, but the mothers I know, as well as the childcare providers I've talked with, do not agree with Ms. Hogg's descriptions.<br /><br />A real disappointment overall.  I'm glad I talked to other mothers to get actually helpful advice on how to take care of my baby.  The best advice:  Never wake a sleeping baby. That's almost always true unless you have some health concern about the baby not eating enough. That's rare, though.
B000P6YNSE|2.0|Wow, it was quite frustrating watching Lost this season.  The series went from keeping me glued to my seat for the first two seasons, to a rather boring and inconsistent show for season three.  Starting off the first third of the season we are treated to watching \\"Prison Break\\" on an island.  All the captives escape with no attempted explanation of why Kate and Sawyer were so important for Michael to abduct at the end of season two (no explanation is ever given for Hurley either).  As the season progresses, no attempt is made to relate to several of the mysteries established in previous seasons.  There is no mention of the numbers, no attempted explanation of why Penny was searching for an electromagnetic charge as shown at the end of season two when the hatch exploded, and no attempted explanation of why Libby was in the mental institution with Hurley or why she gave Desmond the boat.  If you are going to allude to these occurrences at the end of a TV season, it would be a good idea to at least mention them in the subsequent season.  Furthermore, with the shocking revelation in season two that there were tail section survivors, it's rather statistically unrealistic that all but one have now been killed off.  Speaking of killing off characters, what was the point of introducing Nikki and Paulo this season, only to feature them in a half dozen episodes or so before killing them off as well?  All in all it seemed that the show was grasping at straws all season and was a pale comparison to its first two seasons.  It did have its bright points (Jacob, Locke's father appearing on the island, the connection to Swayer, finally finding out how Locke ended up in the wheel chair, and Claire's relation to Jack) but these could have made up about five really cool episodes.  Which is to say this season was full of a lot of filler.  There is the curiosity of the flash forward during the season finale.  At this point it appears that the writers have watched Star Trek: Generationsway too many times to come up with a unique storyline.  While I am interested to see how the story plays out over the last three seasons that ABC has announced, I do not have high hopes for the show to regain the edge of your seat coolness of the first two seasons.
B000MZHW40|5.0|<br />\\"Blood Diamond\\" (2006) is about the brutal struggle in Sierra Leone in the late nineties for control of the diamond mines. DiCaprio is quite good in it. He is plays a diamond smuggler Danny Archer, the scarred survivor of a traumatic childhood. He knows no fear, having already been through everything terrible, but the in depths of his heart there is decency. The film is his odyssey through the inhumane conditions of the Sierra Leone, through slavery, torture, the separation of families, and the exploitation of the weak and innocent. The beauty of the land is in agonizing contrast to the overflowing human misery, aided and abetted by Western businessmen greedy for diamonds. <br /> <br />The real hero of the story is the gentle fisherman Solomon, masterfully played by Djimon Hounsou. Solomon is an example of what a father and husband should be. He puts his family above everything and is willing to risk his life to get them back after they have been taken from him. Even the precious \\"blood diamond\\" holds no allure for Solomon except to the degree that he can use it to save his loved ones. He cannot understand why the DiCaprio character Danny does not have a family and does not plan to use his earnings in order to get married. In Solomon's world view, family is what life is all about. Solomon's commitment to his family begins to transform the smuggler, as well as the Danny's love for the beautiful American journalist (Jennifer Connelly.) Love, as well as admiration for her dedication to human rights, inspires Danny to self-sacrifice. <br /> <br />The most disturbing aspect of the film is the kidnapping and brainwashing of children to be used as soldiers. The revolutionary forces would threaten and brutalize young boys into performing bloodthirsty acts. Once again, we see revolutionaries taking children away from their families and indoctrinating them. It is interesting how drugs and rock music played a significant part in the process. What is so terrible is thatsuch horrors continue daily on the African continent.
0375423877|1.0|This book was highly recommended to me, but I'm afraid I was extremely disappointed.  I realize this point of view is becoming old-fashioned, but the immorality was very offensive to me.  Her new fiancee basically rapes her, in plenty of detail, and she marries him anyway.  It should come as no surprise to readers that he continues to abuse her until he finally leaves her.  There is not a single chapter that doesn't refer to sex in some way.<br /><br />Besides that, the book is quite simple.  Every mystery is easily solved in one chapter, with no twists anywhere.  The first five chapters are spent telling every detail not only of her life up to that point, but also her father's.  But none of it ties in with the rest of the book.  Basically nothing \\"ties in\\" at the end of the book.  It just rambles on until it finally stops, leaving the reader craving a book with some kind of plot.  If you are looking for a good lady detective, try Mrs. Pollifax.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I love this film.  It's so emotionally resonant and yet so fun.  My husband and I really enjoyed watching it with our little boy.  It's a little scary in parts, so don't let the little ones watch it by themselves, but it's really very good.
B000P2A256|5.0|If you are looking for a well produced and solid effort,from top to bottom ,check out the new Maroon 5. I enjoyed the Songs About Jane album and looked forward to this release for a while.It was hard to pick one I actually didn't like here. I like them all.The real good tunes are...If I Never see Your Face Again,Makes Me Wonder,Nothing Lasts Forever(probably my fave on the album),Can't Stop and Goodnight Goodnight. Just a fine mix of ballads and song with funky beats. The formula works well here.<br />I'm usually not a fan of the real \\"poppy\\" stuff,but there are always exceptions.This one was done very well.Adam Levine has proven to be a real good songwriter and look forward to the future.I put him up there with Rob Thomas of MB Twenty as two of today's real good songwriter's. In the meantime,check this one out.You will not be disappointed.<br />Buy it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000OCXFCO|1.0|Up until this album I was a Huge Megadeth fan. I've seen them live twice.  But this album just shoves too much of Dave's beliefs in your face, which it is great to speak your mind, but he talks down to everyone. <br />He knows everything, plus his incomprehsible lyrics of his screwed up political views that are beyond democratic or republican, just insane. But I got the point. I dont like it. The solos are boring. No memorable guitar riffs.  10 of the songs sound like he didnt even try. The remake of toute a le monde sounds so stupid, he completely messed it up. Im so dissapointed, Im done with Megadeth!
B0000070QN|5.0|Harem Scarem - WOW! What a great album. This is a superb collection of beautiful melodic rock songs. You have to listen to this music if you're at all interested in skillful yet catchy melodic rock in the vein of Giant, Extreme, Hardline etc. These guys can do no wrong! Great playing all round especially the awesome guitars. Killer vocal melodies and harmonies. Absolutely perfect production. All their albums are great so it is very hard to rank them but this one has a nice balance of rock and melody and songwriting and magic. This genre of music has been done alot but there are a few standout acts who really know what they're doing and Harem Scarem is one of them. Enjoy!
B000NVIXDW|4.0|I am a huge MB fan, but this CD is not my favorite, although still enjoyable.
B0002NRRAG|5.0|There is nothing I can write about \\"Careless Love\\", that will top the two spotlight reviews.  All I will say is thank God there are artists still left in the world like Maleleine Peyroux, Diana Krall, Cassandra Wilson, etc... etc... This whole recording is excellent, and I can never get enough of her version of Bob Dylan's classic \\"When You Go\\".  The warmth and passion she emits from her sleepy, serene voice... man, oh man, does she make me feel all warm and gushy inside.  I love singers who pour all their emotions into their songs, who let it all hang out.  Sure, she's no Billie Holiday, but there is no popular singer alive today that resembles Billie more than Madeleine.  I just saw her in concert recently and she and her quartet were absolutely awesome.<br /><br />Those of you looking for an option from all of that top 40 sewage that plagues our airwaves nowadays, look no further than Madeleine.  I have heard just about all of her stuff and this particular recording is my personal favorite.  This is also perfect music for many of you out there looking to simply wade into the world of jazz music, rather than diving in head first.  Jazz is like fine wine, you don't develope a taste for it overnight, however, once you do start developing that taste, well... then it's all over for you.  Trust me, I know from experience.<br /><br />Enjoy this one!
0060245867|5.0|...he/she will enjoy it for years.  I purchased this book after a co-worker highly recommended it.  My child was an infant at the time, and although the book has a recommended age range of 4 to 8, I read it to her anyway.  It was of course over her head, but I highly enjoyed the story myself - which is almost as important as the child enjoying the book, right?  My girl is now approaching three years old and she enjoys the book as much as I do.  It's fun to follow the story as the simple act of giving a mouse a cookie escalates into an endless cycle of giving the mouse other things he requires as a result of the cookie gift.  It's a silly, lighthearted tale and the illustrations are fun.  If You Give a Mouse a Cookie will surely be a family favorite for years to come, and I'm glad I purchased the hardcover version since it's likely to be passed down to the next generation.
B000002LGA|5.0|Lou Reed-New York *****<br /><br />Next to Berlin, New York may be Lou Reeds best solo effort. New York is a distructive tail about his beloved city during the citys all time low period, the 1980's. Tales of sex, drugs, aids, romance, poverty, and even politics at time. On New York Lou Reed holds nothing back what ever he felt or thought comes through in the songs. This also marks the first Reed album with has absolutly no trace of Velvet Underground sound or anything that resembles the past (except of course for the city of New York).<br /><br />Mike Rathke is brought on board to help out on guitar with Reed which helps to make New York not only Reeds most hard rocking album but also one of his most powerful and most concistant, especially with tracks like the strong 'Strawman.' Songs like 'There Is No Time' shows that there was good music in the 1980's, and its right here. 'Busload Of Faith' is  agreat song of self-reliance in a world where you cant rely on anyone else.<br /><br />New York contains some of the very best lyrics of Reeds career, tracks like 'Beginning Of A Great Adventure' and 'Halloween Parade' show Reeds true love for his city, while others like 'Dirty Blvd.' let you feel his desperation for the city to grow and become better and yet at the same time you can tell he doesn't want it to change because he likes all the trash that goes down on the streets of New York. The lead song on the album 'Romeo And Juliette' maybe the strongest and best song that Reed has ever composed, rivaling all his material in The Velvet Underground.<br /><br />To choose between New York and Berlin as to which is Lou Reeds best album would be nearly impossible as both albums are of the same callabor. For anyone interested in the man both albums are recommended over the criminaly overrated Transformer, and for any fan of The Velvet Underground these two are sure to please as well as The Blue Mask.
B00005JL0U|5.0|Man, are you kidding?  This has got to be the result of some legal wranging!  The sales of \\"MOONWALKER\\" alone would put a BIG dent in MJ's financial troubles. (well, maybe not a BIG dent, but a dent just the same.)
0752864300|4.0|I have never dreamed of Electric sheep so does that mean I'm not an Android? I doubt it would matter. I'm pretty sure none of the androids we have ever known dreamed of them. I don't recall Yul Brynner in \\"Westworld\\" or Arnold Schwarzenegger talking about it in \\"Terminator\\". I certainly don't recall Data in the \\"Star Trek: Next Generation\\" exposing the lack of sleep causing him to resort to such a measure. I know Isaac Asimov's robots didn't since I read all his Robots and Foundation series. Why is this book even discussed to any degree? Two reasons. One, it is a good book with some unusual ideas. Two, if it wasn't it would never have caught the eye of movie producers and directors and led to the making of \\"Blade Runner\\". Now the fact only have some roughly similar viewpoints doesn't make either the book or the movie bad. I think each are great in their own medium. And why would anyone say you can't judge a book by it's cover? Duh! So although I get the book, I like the movie. I can't help it I'm into visualization. But those of you like to feel the paper, cloth, or leatherette binders I understand.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This amazing series couldn't be more timely.  We are inundated with messages about global warming and the \\"inconvenient truths\\".  If I hadn't seen this amazing series, I would probably be depressed and think it's the end of the world as we know it.  This beautiful, breathtaking, well crafted documentary shows us all the beauty alive and well on our planet!  It reminds us that there is so much awesome beauty that we MUST save.  The cinematography is stunning to say the least.  Every home should have this set, to experience nature and our world as never before.  All the extras in the DVD are great.  I have already given one as a gift, and plan on giving more of them.
B000003TA4|4.0|Please people, I see way too many young kids these days, all born around Kobain's death that just buy this album.  This is not, and never will be Nirvana's best album.  If you want to hear Nirvana with their best sound, go with the 1989 sub-pop release, \\"Bleach.\\"  After you listen to Bleach some 300 times, then you can purchase Nevermind.  All us older folk did that before Nevermind even came out.  You haven't heard Nirvana, until you've rocked out to Bleach.  And remember kids, you can never dust off your flannel shirt.  Oh, and by the way, in all technicality this was never grunge, Bleach was.  Screaming trees, Mother Love Bone, Early Pearl Jam, and Mudhoney are some grunge examples.

B00004Z400|5.0|I bought this album as soon as it came out and played it over and over for awhile. The sounds are incredible because even though the guitars are so up front nothing seems to overpower or distort. It has a lot of great moments in it but I really was impressed with Chino's range, thats some powerful vocal cords.I think it could add to any hard rock fans collection.
B000O1799U|4.0|\\"Dreamgirls\\" is a cinematic version of the Tony award-winning musical that had a 4-year run on Broadway in the 1980s. Inspired by 1960s R&B girl groups and the rise of Motown Records, the musical follows the personal trials and career triumphs of a trio called \\"The Dreams\\". By making subtle changes in the characters' circumstances, the movie associates The Dreams more closely with The Supremes than the stage musical did. Although it's easy to identify the movie's inspirations in the history of The Supremes, this is clearly a fictionalized account that has just enough real life to tantalize the audience. The film introduces some new songs but has less music than the stage production, as it's shorter.<br /><br />Three hopeful young women sing their way into the audience's hearts at a Detroit talent show, where they are spotted by Curtis Taylor (Jamie Foxx), an ambitious manager who thinks the ladies are just what aging R&B star Jimmy Early (Eddie Murphy) needs to revitalize his act. Curtis signs \\"The Dreamettes\\" as back up singers and sends them on tour. Determined to achieve success on the pop charts, Curtis makes them a stand-alone act, moving willful, talented Effie White (Jennifer Hudson) to backup role and replacing her with the pretty, slighter chanteuse Deena Jones (Beyonce Knowles), who, along with backup singer Lorrell Robinson (Anika Noni Rose), become \\"The Dreams\\". The act is a hit, but Effie's resentment and Curtis' stifling control breed behind-the-scenes strife.<br /><br />\\"Dreamgirls\\" is a slick, competent, thoroughly conventional musical that doesn't find its footing until about halfway through. The first hour is frankly dull. But the story becomes more compelling as it progresses and tensions between the characters heighten. I wasn't impressed by the singing. I would expect better on Broadway. But The Supremes were never strong singers, and the lovely Beyonce Knowles, who rose to stardom helming girl group Destiny's Child, is the perfect choice for Diana Ross-inspired Deena. Jennifer Hudson won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her Florence Ballard-inspired role. There is no subtlety in the performances, but if I had to choose a stand-out, it would be Eddie Murphy. In any case, there are enough showmanship and intriguing insinuations in \\"Dreamgirls\\" to satisfy.<br /><br />The DVD (Paramount 2007 single disc): Bonus features on the single disc include 12 Extended and Alternate Scenes, and a Music Video (4 min) for the song \\"Listen\\" performed by Beyonce Knowles.

B000002L99|4.0|I remember when Van Halen had David Lee Roth but even as a kid I just thought he was a circus clown. I love a lot of the early songs but when Hagar came in he brought substance. This was already a heavily talented group but to make that kind of transition at your peak and end up getting more well known for it!! That pretty much never happens. Musically they just took off on this album my only problem with it is it could of used a couple more songs to fill it up. Good times.
B00005JPAO|5.0|\\"The Queen\\" chronicles the behind-the-scenes drama of the British royal family in the week following the death of Diana, Princess of Wales on the 30th of August 1997. Princess Diana' death plunges the monarchy into an unexpected crisis when public grief overflows into the streets and parks. Queen Elizabeth II (Helen Mirren) considers Diana's death a private affair and can't fathom her people's need for a public funeral or acknowledgement from the royal family: \\"The less attention one draws to it, the better.\\" Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair (Michael Sheen), elected head of the government by a landslide just a few months before, understands what the public expects and the dangers of the monarchy not fulfilling that role: \\"Will someone please save these people from themselves?\\" So he advises, pleads, and cajoles the Queen into making a public tribute in the face of growing anti-monarchist sentiment.<br /><br />Helen Mirren won an Oscar for her portrayal of this monarch who keeps her feelings so much to herself that people tend to doubt that she has feelings. I'm not convinced myself, but \\"The Queen\\" offers an interesting perspective on Her Majesty's stoicism: Duty precludes her from ever being partial. She can't even vote. And she despised Princess Diana -with good reason- so was probably not anguished by her death. In presenting Diana's death from the perspective of the royal family, secluded at Balmoral Castle, the film tries to make the Queen a sympathetic figure, a bastion of traditional culture suddenly confronted with a celebrity culture that she does not understand. This does little in my mind to alleviate the fact that Queen Elizabeth II utterly lacks leadership skills, charisma, and is so uncomprehending of her own culture that she erodes the usefulness of the monarchy. But I have to admit that she -or her verisimilitude- is fascinating to watch.<br /><br />We also see the perspective of Tony Blair and his staff at 10 Downing Street on Princess Diana's death and that of the British public, who are represented by real television news footage. In fact, everyone is experiencing the crisis through television. The royals, the government, and the public spend a lot of time watching each other on TV. It's difficult to know where director Stephen Frears and writer Peter Morgan's sympathies lie, if anywhere. The events of \\"The Queen\\" resulted from the clash of three dysfunctional parties, though the film does not explicitly say so: mentally ill Princess Diana, emotionally stunted and out-of-touch Queen Elizabeth II, and the British people whose initial expressions of affection and grief quickly degenerated into an obscene display of self-pity.<br /><br />If you're wondering how screenwriter Stephen Marber knew what happened behind closed doors in the days following Princess Diana's death, he drew on his own sources inside 10 Downing Street and those of historian Robert Lacey inside Balmoral Castle. Mr. Lacey wrote the book \\"Majesty\\" about the reign of Elizabeth II and served as consultant on this film. Beside the obvious inability to know the precise content of private conversations, some liberties have been taken with the story, including the subplot involving the stag at Balmoral, which serves as metaphor. And a wonderful metaphor it is. \\"The Queen\\" is a sublimely insightful film that possesses more gravity than any of its dramatis personae would seem to merit alone.<br /><br />The DVD (Miramax 2007): There are a making-of documentary and 2 audio commentaries. \\"The Making of The Queen\\" (18 min) has 3 parts: the cast, director Stephen Frears, and other crew discuss the challenges of portraying real people; the environments of the film as created through production and costume designs; and crew members talk about their experiences of the week that Princess Diana died. The first audio commentary by director Stephen Frears and screenwriter Peter Morgan is sporadic and addresses a miscellany of topics without being informative. Skip it. The second audio commentary by historian Robert Lacey is excellent and very worthwhile if you enjoyed the film. Lacey discusses the film's themes of traditional vs celebrity culture and the perspective of the royals vs the public. He explains the context of events and the meaning of protocols. He tells us what is and is not based on fact as far as it could be ascertained, takes us through the actions of the characters, and explains the politics for us foreigners.

I am amazed that she took me from being closed minded about the murderer to feeling sorry for him, but that is Jodi.  The part of the book that I found hard to read was only because I hope that my grandson is not bullied as Peter was.  This book should be read by every school official, and the insanity must be stopped.  It was a real learning experience for me.
0670034711|5.0|What a hilarious, insightful, interesting read.  Elizabeth Gilbert could have come across as a smarty-pants, know-it-all Yankee, but her self-deprecating sense of humor and unflinching honesty about her flaws prevents that. <br /> <br />I highly recommend listening to the audio version.  The author is a wonderful reader. <br /> <br />Each time I listened to a section, I couldn't wait to talk about it.  This book would make a wonderful Book Discussion selection - maybe more for a women's group. <br /> <br />I just bought a paper copy so I could underline & make notes!

B000P2A256|4.0|As someone who finds \\"Songs About Jane\\" to be an entirely unlistenable tutorial in boy-band excess, I'd like to think that my adoration for this  astonishing follow-up carries a noteworthy degree of credibility and weight. When I heard the sublime piece of pop mastery, \\"Won't Go Home Without You\\", in a local Starbucks one recent afternoon, I was so shocked when a barista told me it was Maroon 5 that I nearly choked on my tea and waited several days to ask a different employee to verify, who once again told me it was Maroon 5. This delightful album showcases the boundless maturation of a band I wouldn't have been caught dead listening to just a few weeks ago. While the production is still over the top, the album's flawless melodies and superior musicianship both surprise and challenge me to broaden my musical palate further than I ever dreamed possible. I liken some of the better songs here to a strange crossbreed of the Beach Boys and Coldplay with the occasional flicker of an authentic rock-'n-roll backbone. This album's achievements, given the syrupy and tasteless misguidedness of its predecessor, cannot be overstated. I know I am in the minority on my feelings about this band's debut, but I also think that other skeptics like myself have reason to give this album a chance if snobby cynics like me are publicly admitting their guilty affection for it.

1582701709|1.0|We are each looking for answers, trying to figure out how to make our lives better, more secure, more love- and laughter-filled.  Like many others before her, Rhonda Byrne takes advantage of that human impulse, offering false pseudo-philosophy and pseudo-research for her own financial benefit.  This is a how-to book built upon specious \\"logic,\\" feel-good promises and prejudice.  It preys upon the wistfully hopeful with gnostic promises and weak-minded arguments.  If all it did was relieve you of some money, it would be only as wrong as much of our society.  But if you were actually to apply Byrne's so-called \\"secret\\" in your daily life you would change your character for the worse.  That is the great wrong of this facile piece of New Age babble.

B000NVIXFK|5.0|I'm going to take a small risk to say this album is right up with the best Rush has ever created. In response to a comment to my review below, all I can say is that the music is *different* than 2112.  Sorry to burst your bubble.    And as broadly philosophical as much of Peart's writing was in the 70's & 80's, it is personally observational today.  The underlying context of the philosophical premise of Neil's observations is; reassuringly, unchanged.  Lee and Lifeson's music reserves the much needed space for hope and optimism among lyrics that are appropriately cynical for our time.  The three defined musical breaks in The Way the Wind Blows is an example of the music complementing the lyric... I imagine it is no coincidence it begins with the blues. The outstanding musical progression of the World (wheel) rolling over the individual in Far Cry is another example...and there are other examples of the music-lyric on this incredibly creative album (okay, CD...).     The glorious, humanistic ideas that laid the foundation for masterpieces like Free Will, Cygnus, Natural Science, Anthem (for us wanting to talk about the early stuff here) and Tom Sawyer will endure for nearly as long as there are humans.  Many of the songs on this album, like \\"Faithless,\\" are Peart's personal pleas extending from these same ideas, expressed in a way that I can only describe as inspiring; particularly when viewed with kids to raise among the haze of today's society.  Lyrical statements like this were neither necessary nor appreciated (nor ridiculed) in the 80's ...Cold War considered.  (I'm 40).    There are other inspired statements made on this album among the heady and soaring production, and this makes the whole package incredibly  powerful.  This is certainly the best production and mix since Terry Brown, even if it does come off a bit modern rock cliché'.     There is huge atmospheric depth, detail, and dynamic range to be heard through the many layers.  It takes several listensto acclimate to and appreciate, but this is not unusual when approaching anything new of complexity.  There are gorgeous melodies (even harmonies), and there is a rocking edge.  This CD is a giant leap from the sub-standard (ok horrible) production quality of Vapor Trails.  Snakes and Arrows was created and produced with greatness that I think in time will rank with Rush's most impressive work ever.      ***I edited this review, because after five listens my first attempt wasn't complementary enough to this outstanding effort by the three guys from the North.  I listened to this album with a Jolida tube CD with EI 12AT7's, Jolida JD-1000RC tube amp (EI Elite 12AT7's Siemens 12AX7's, 2 Quads of SED Winged C EL34's, and Hales Revelation 3 speakers.       Please, leave your IPOD compressors in the cradle, charged but disconnected for this brilliantly recorded CD. And don't even think about sacrificing this work to an MP3.  There is too much to be heard here to compress.
B000B5XOYI|3.0|Alright. I'll try to be brief.  <br />Batman was good. Joker was weird. but it was interesting to see the 80's take on Batman. The new rubber suit looked very, very stiff. I know they all are, but this was the stiffest. I liked the beginning, but the bat sign on his chest has too many sharp angles that looks ugly. Other than that the story was good, very dark too. Keaton doesn't play the rich boy, playboy persona too well but you get used to it. Surprising that it was joker who killed his parents. Very surprising. 3 out of 5 stars. <br />Batman Returns was really good. Loved the suit.It fit more on Keaton and wasn't bloated like the first. Absolutely great Catwoman. Michelle Phieffer nailed that part.Penguin was really weird but Danny nailed it too. My one gripe is that they should really stage some good fight scenes. It seems like Batman is just a walking display. Good movie. 3 1/2 out of 5 stars. <br />Batman Forever...well it was a strange movie. New Bruce...New Batman...Different style. Extremely bright crazy lights and alot of an overreacting Two Face. Riddler was great and funny. Good job Jim. I liked this when it first came out mostly because the action improved alot. Great fights. Hideous Batmobile. Great Robin story. I give it a 3 out of 5, only because it was a lot less realistic than Returns. <br />Batman and Robin was a complete joke. I actually saw this in the theaters. What a bad movie. Period. I heard the same guys who made the Power Rangers kid show made this. No wonder. Way to goofy and stupid. Even the action couldn't save it. Bad Ivy, Bane is a walking, bulking dunce who only says \\"AAUUURGHH!\\" What is with Mr. Freeze. Arnold? Of all the people. Arnold? He was so cheesy in this. Batgirl doesn't help either.This is where everyone thought (including myself) that Batman sunk and would never be ressurected...until he \\"Begins\\" again in '05. This gets a 1 out of 5.

0143037757|1.0|Tony Judt is a British historian who has recently received wide publicity because of his outspoken criticism of Israel and the \\"Israeli lobby\\" which went as far as calling Israel an \\"anachronism\\"(!). His views on these matters are extreme enough to induce major Jewish advocacy organizations such as the Anti-Defamation League to request cancellation of a planned talk by Judt.<br /><br />This book shows that its author's whining about Israel is not something isolated but indicative of his more general attitudes towards small countries that have managed to move forward. For example, he criticizes the smaller members of the 80's European Community (Ireland, Portugal etc.) for tricking their richer partners to give them money they did not deserve. So the author would have us believe that some of the strongest countries on Earth led at the time by people like Thatcher, Kohl and Mitterand were cheated into decisions against the interests of their countries and their Treasuries. In fact, the way trading blocks such as the EU work is based on reciprocality. Financial support for the development of the poorer areas is expected, given the richer partners' much more fundamental benefit of having a practically guaranteed market for their products. The naive model of gratuitous cash transfers the book presents is simply not plausible in an organization with complex decision processes involving several sovereign states.<br /><br />In the case of Greece, another small country I am also familiar with and at which the author is particularly bitter, the book even contains some factual errors!<br /><br />1. A quick look at news reports disproves Judt's claim that the Macedonian dispute was mainly caused by the Greek concern that the name \\"Republic of Macedonia\\" \\"somehow implied\\" territorial claims to the expense of the Greek province Macedonia. Though the name was important-especially in an area where history and symbols have been used to redraw borders-the real issue was the explicit claims to Greek territories by the Macedonians. In fact, the dispute was essentially resolved with the \\"interim agreement\\", with which Macedonia withdrew the explicit claims against Greece contained in their original constitution and official maps.<br /><br />2. On the same issue, Judt, disturbingly, dismisses the Greek concerns on the grounds of (in his view) lack of racial purity of the population in the Greek province of Macedonia. The verifiable factual error here is that the Slavic-speaking groups in the area are too small to be relevant for the author's point. More important though is his difficulty to understand the mainstream definition of Greek national identity and conscience which has never been based on race but, instead, on culture, language and, possibly, religion (for more on that, see, e.g. any of M. Herzfeld's books).<br /><br />3. Another verifiable inaccuracy is the claim that in the 2004 discussions concerning entry of Turkey into the EU, Greece was one of the countries opposing the start of entry negotiations. He is off by about 10 years! Since the middle of the 90's, Greece has become one of the champions of Turkish accession into the EU.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this way of treating the subjects of the book is not restricted to Greece and the other small EU states. Strong feelings that are not based on correct facts and a thorough analysis very quickly tend to degenerate to prejudice.laims to Greek territories by the Macedonians.

B00006G8HX|3.0|I really don't know what to make of this third installment of the Star Trek movie series. I don't think its all that great, but I don't think its terrible either. I guess I just left somewhere in the middle. To me, the whole plot is a bit shaky. I understand, they had to bring Spock back in some way, and I suppose any way they chose to done it, it would have taken some stretch of imagination to accept it. But hey, this is science fiction, I suppose about anything is possible at this point. I've seen enough original Star Trek episodes to know that!! But I don't know, I just didn't find myself too interested overall. The reason, is like I said, the overall plot and another reason I suppose, is infact, Spock is barely in the movie, which understandable, but nonetheless, disspointing. I didn't care too much for the re-occuring Lt. Saavik character (not played by Kristy Alley this time), apparently trying to fill Spock's spot for this film to some degree. In summary, this film is just kinda \\"forgettable\\" to me. Its nothing that bad, but nothing real good.
B000F0UV0E|2.0|But the truth is they both sound like they're asleep. Knopfler's now-standard Nashville sound is great...for about two cuts. Then it's just a drone. Same with EHarris, same with Knopfler, who seems barely able to finish singing the words, like he's going to faceplant at any minute. Even he's not interested, and he wrote most of the material.<br /><br />These two should be able to generate some serious heat, but if this is them, I don't want to know them.<br /><br />Interestingly, there was a PBS Soundstage presentation of a concert of this, and while I found it interesting to watch (because I like seeing how Knopfler plays) I just found it so damn mechanical, just like this record. All the Roadrunning leaves the odometer going 'tick...tick...tick...'
B0000683DH|4.0|After being dissapointed with the first Star Trek motion picture, I was greatly surprised with Star Trek II. The original crew appear to be back in pretty much top form. I felt they were a bit rusty in the first film as far as acting together as a group. There are also some key new characters added that bring a whole lot to the film as well. The overall plot is much better than that of the first film too. It was brilliant to bring back a character from an episode of the orginal series, Khan, and really make it work. If you're just a casual fan of the Star Trek series and haven't watched many of the original episodes, you might want to get your hands on the \\"Space Seed\\" episode. You, by no means, NEED to watch this episode before viewing this film to understand it, but it might make you aprreciate it a little more in the long run. But if you're a fan to begin with, its basically like watching one of your favorite Star Trek episodes, except on a greater scale. In my opinion, if you're looking for the definitive Star Trek movie, this is it.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|Full season in a box. If you like ghoulies and ghoasties and demons and pretty blokes killing 'em, you'll love this. My 16-year old daughter says it's the best thing on TV. We got the Season One boxset in two parts in the UK and neither came with any extras. The US version (Region 1) was much better equipped and all in one glorious package (her words, not mine. I think she means the DVDs, although she could be refering to Jensen Ackles), so if you've got the Region 1 version, don't get suckered into getting the brace of Region 2 disks as you'll be disappointed. <br />Good harmless fun, if you like demon hunting and stuff. Me, I just like seeing the Impala (and I definately mean the car!)
B000083C49|2.0|I can understand what the writers of Star Trek IV were trying to do: Make a film more lighter and yet create an epic adventure. In theory, this sounds good, but with a plot like this one, I can't say I'm happy with the overall result. Now, don't get me wrong, back in the day, there were pretty crazy plots in the original Star Trek series. Need I mention Season 3's \\"Spock's Brain\\"? I'll spare re-telling the whole story of this film, undoubtly, you already know it from other reviews, but in a nutshell, the crew has to go back in time to get extinct humpback whales or the future Planet earth is destroyed. If you think that's funny, note that all of this is determined by the crew by themselves in oh...about a minute and half!!!! Basically, this plot just seems so over-the-top dumb, espeically for a major motion picture that includes a bigger audience rather than just the die hard Star Trek fans who would probably enjoy the movie if the story was about the crew having a slumber party. I can't believe that many fans are calling this film the best in the series. The saving grace of this film is the humor. There are some great scenes with Kirk and Spock, as well as Scotty, in then present-day San Fran. doing their best \\"fish out of water\\" routines. Really good humor, I must admit. But maybe someone should have spent a little more time on the overall STORY of the film rather than just adding humor. It's almost like they wrote the story specifically for humor, rather than just writing a good story and injecting humor in it. Hey, if you want to add humor, add some humor. If you want time travel, go for it, I'm all for time travel..but whales?? Give me a break....to quote the movie, I think someone took \\"too much LDS\\" when they were writing the script!
B00005JKC3|5.0|hulk is definitely one of the most under rated films of the past few years.  dont watch it expecting a summer action movie.  rather expect to see a intelligent, well written film that draws on some of the better human aspects of the comic.  for this reason, the hulk does not get as much screen time as the other characters.  but when he does appear, its a real treat!  in hindsight, it shouldnt have been marketed as a summer blockbuster.
1594489505|5.0|....for me to read The Kite Runner. <br /> <br />I read A Thousand Splendid Suns in six. <br /> <br />This book is less disturbing than The Kite Runner. There is more quiet desperation. A bit less personal story, and a bit more history. <br /> <br />But, it is no less gripping. The story and the history are beautifully woven together. The author holds nothing back in painting a stark picture of what it means to be a woman in a culture where they are valued only for how well they keep a house, and how many sons they produce. A culture where they are subject to the whims of men. Those that value them as worthwhile human beings are welcome oases - they seem to be the exceptions in their world, rather than the norm. <br /> <br />He also paints a stark picture of how much harm religious fanaticism and intolerance can do. <br /> <br />But, it also paints a picture of hope that the winds of change can blow cool and refreshing.  <br /> <br />It also shows us the rich history of Afghanistan, a country that has endured, much like Nana said that women must. It shows a country and a people with much potential. <br /> <br />My eyes welled in a few places. At one point, I had to stop reading, close my eyes, and gather myself as the story hit close to home. I even laughed (Islamic flamingos.) By the end, tears were streaming down my face, and I was once again left feeling immensely satisfied. <br /> <br />It is rare that you find a writer who, with their first novel, shows that they are an immense talent. I had previously only ever read one such author in my life. From the first chapter of The Kite Runner, I knew that Khaled Hosseini would be one of them. A Thousand Splendid Suns is more proof of it.  <br /> <br />I am already looking forward to what he produces next.
B000N4SHPS|5.0|Although I wish they had made this film 15 years ago it still was a wonderful heart felt movie dealing with loss, redemption and growing as a human being. If you watch this film for the boxing then you should get something else. This film is all about taking life's best punch and keep moving forward. I thought the script was at times bad but there are some funny one liners. If you are a true Rocky fan you will love the movie. What the script lacks is made up for by the lessons learned from the film.
B000MV9026|2.0|Like the other posters I have to give this two stars simply for the animation.  It is a beautiful looking movie.  However, the plot is confusing and uninteresting.  The political message is not subtle and takes away from the fun parts of the movie.  I was also disgusted by the blatent sexual content.  Why is that necessary in what is billed as a children's movie?  Overall, I just was not impressed.
B0002KQNL8|5.0|I actually like \\"Return of the Living Dead: Part II\\" better than the first.  Though that could be considered blasphemous, this movie appealed more to me in my youth over the first, which I have finally come to accept as an outstanding zombie movie...<br /><br />This edition features two of the same actors from the first in very similar buddy roles.  The cast is pretty good, and the young boy lead is a strong performer for his age.<br /><br />The movie is filled with zombie style laughs, including a cemetary rising scene that is super cool, but filled with cheesy laughs...<br /><br />A must see in my opinion...
B0000CDLA7|5.0|Dream Theater was introduced to me through the group Savatage and Trans-Siberian Orchestra. ( I'm a heavy fan of both groups ) I also listen to other groups such as Genesis,Kansas,Yes,ELO,Rush and the like. After putting this album on and listening to it several times,I could hear traces of those other groups in different parts of the recording. I give it a 5 star here because the drummer really shines here - ( ok,I'm a drummer for over 30+ yrs.) In a nut shell,this recording is not only a first for me,but one that will be in my liabary for along while!!<br /><br />  Go get ahold of this recording if you like your music loud,fun and strong --- you will wide up with more than a grin on your face as this album \\"lets it all hang loose!\\" :-)<br /><br />  Enjoy!!!
B000QUCNOK|5.0|Well there is not much I can say that the first editorial reviewer already said that would be much of a difference.  However, to put it short. It is a must see movie.  This is coming from someone who watches a lot of movies and re not impressed with the majority of them because they are so predictable and lack originality.  A movie that captures smell at its finest. I learned a lot from this movie as well.
B000P0J02E|5.0|I have to admit, this is a great score from Hans Zimmer. Being a big fan of most of his work I expected great things from this disc, and it delivered on all of my hopes. The overall tone of the album is different than Dead Man's Chest or the Black Pearl soundtrack. It seems (to me anyway) that the music is bigger and much more dramatic than the previous scores. Zimmer uses instruments that I've rarely heard in his work, such as a piccolo and flute. This disc represents one of the most well rounded recordings of his to date.     As has already been pointed out by other reviewers At Wit's End and I Don't Think Now Is The Best Time are incredible tracks. I'd like to include I See Dead People In Boats and Singapore in that short list of standouts. Multiple Jacks is also a very good bit of music, albeit with a strange mix of rather exotic instruments. Up Is Down has a certain playfulness that I really enjoy as well.     I have to admit however that I have one complaint about this compilation. The music that is playing in the last minute or so of the trailer is not included. The music in question picks up when the first glimpse of the sea battle starts. It is an incredible bit of music that plays prominently for nearly a third of the trailer yet didn't make the cut on this disc. I'm absolutely shocked by this. My understanding was that I Don't Think Now Is Best Time runs around 26 minutes in the film and I believe this \\"phantom\\" music came from there. I could be wrong but that's where I think it would fit. Anyway, it's a shame that Disney (or whoever is responsible) edited this out of the soundtrack. The disc runs fifty-six minutes so it's not a question of available time, there was plenty.     That might sound like a small complaint (and it is) but the track in question was an absolutely stunning piece of music. With that said, I will repeat that what is here is undeniably the best score released for any of the three films. I just guess I'll have to wait until the extended version of the soundtrack comes out (which I believe I read was going to happen for all three films)...      ***UPDATE***    After watching the film over the weekend I was just as surprised to find that the musical piece referenced above is also missing from the film itself. Not just the soundtrack. Why do they do this? After looking at some other reviews it seems I'm not the only one who was looking forward to hearing this.
0553296981|5.0|This is, at best, a novelization of Anne Frank's diary. I don't doubt that there was a young Jewish girl named Anne Frank who lived in the Secret Annexe with her family and four other people. I don't doubt that she kept a diary of her life in the Annexe, or that all the occupants were terrified of being discovered. I don't doubt that they were the victims of a terrible crime against humanity.<br /><br />What I doubt is that the Anne Frank who speaks to us through the words is the real Anne Frank. Instead, the Anne Frank of the book is a creation of the editor and translator. She writes unlike any 13-15 year old. Her words are unmatched in eloquence and she uses words and phrases that are far beyond the vocabulary of even bright young teens.<br /><br />Likewise, the pacing and story construction is so well done as to call into question the authenticity of Anne's words. The book is too novel-like to be believable as a diary. The clever use of wording and pacing lead to a depth that can be plumbed for meaning many times over. One such \\"trick\\" is how Peter Van Daan is called to be respectful towards Anne in their blooming romance. Anne is hopeful that Peter will not \\"disappoint\\" her by making too forward of advances. Later on, she mentions in a single breath that she is disappointed in him, but this is not accompanied by any explanation. The very next diary entry, she relays her fretfulness over her late period. The astute reader may put two and two together and come to the conclusion that Anne and Peter may have been having sexual relations. But it is cleverly never said outright.<br /><br />Another example is how the diary foreshadows Anne's reunion with Lies through her premonitions. Before her death, Anne once again met with Lies at the concentration camp. It is a little too convenient.<br /><br />The incarnation of Dostoyevsky's Amalia Ivanovna in the person of Mrs. Van Daan was a nice touch. (poof! poof!)<br /><br />The triumphant closing diary entry stands in sharp contrast to the subsequent real-life events that took the lives of most of the Secret Annexe occupants. The book is too perfect, its timing too impeccable, and its style too eloquent that it ceases to be the diary of Anne Frank and is instead the novelization of whatever diary she may have actually kept.<br /><br />Strangely, it was the afterword that affected me the most. Where it is the narrator discussing the end of Anne's life as it happened, where she is stripped of her eloquence and becomes the real Anne Frank once again.<br /><br />The book is deep and rich. It encourages thoughtfulness in the reader, and challenges the reader to examine his own beliefs. It humanizes the victims and shows them to be sometimes good, sometimes bad, many times brave, and occasionally terrified. It's less the diary of a young girl than it is the tragic story of people making the best in an impossible situation. I can't recommend it enough.rp contrast to the subsequent real-life events that took the lives of most of the Secret Annexe occupants.

0385338686|4.0|I listened to the audio verision on XM Sonic Theater, and I couldn't stop laughing.  It's typical chick lit, but it's fun for a laugh!  The audio is great and captures personalities of the characters. Yes, it's predictable, but you'll enjoy the ride!
B000NVIGC0|2.0|are \\"sky blue sky\\" and \\"far, far away\\" the same song?  i thought i was listening to being there.  was it an accident that \\"shake it off\\" made the album?  i certainly hope so.  this is by far wilco's poorest showing.  with the exeception of \\"what light\\" and \\"impossible germany\\"  this record is garbage.  all the reviewers giving this album such high praise are out of their mind.
B000P2A256|5.0|...why Maroon 5 is the super group that they are. As a fan, I will say that this review is biased, but it will be well-thought out. It will not be a fan's decree of their fave bands excellence. (or amybe it will!)<br /><br />The album is off to a great start with the first few songs. All of which are upbeat melodies showcasing the fine tuning touring has given the three guitarists and Adam's vocals. Matt's drums do a thing or two to my eardrums as well. Thus, you get a beginning that lays the foundation for what the album will be--pop/rock at its best. The middle of the album is layered with superbly decided tracks with the right amount of love song balladry over pop strings and pounding drums. They seem to carry you through the each song's story and never lets go. Then, we end with a powerfully sexy track and two expertly written ballads that coast the high powered album to a halt, and doesn't leave you hanging.<br /><br />Now the critique:<br /><br />While the band obviously took its cues from 80's pop (Micheal jackson, anyone!?), they do something else too. In the midst of finding a new sound, they have left the alternative emo-driven songs of the first album. And, instead become a pop/rock band--reminiscent of a grown-up boy band. To some that is an insult, but for Maroon 5 it shows that even with Adam's high pitched vocals over sugary beats a fan can still find a little old M5 in there (\\"Goodnight, Goodnight\\" and \\"Kiwi\\"). It's this maturity mixed with not taking life (and music) so seriously that boads well for the group's sophomore album.<br /><br />Overall, the album is a fine attempt. It shows that the group isn't afraid of stereotypes, and in fact takes those stereotypes and makes 12 songs worthy of taking a listen.
6304712944|2.0|Vanessa Redgrave can't sing - perhaps the song should be \\"The Simple Joys of Silence\\" instead of \\"The Simple Joys of Maidenhood\\". <br />Franco Nero leaves you cold.   <br />Richard Harris, however, is the one, bright, shining moment in this Camelot.  The [[ASIN:B000NTM9ZM Broadway Version]] which he did in '82 is head and shoulders above this.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|This is such a refreshing album. <br /> <br />I've liked Linkin Park from the beginning, and this indeed does represent growth and maturation for their sound.  It seems that the majority of fans on here do not like the change, but I find it to be a breath of fresh air. <br /> <br />While Meteora was a decent album, it only seemed like \\"Hybrid Theory - Part 2\\", to me.  There was not much more depth than on their first album, and quickly fell to the wayside for me. <br /> <br />Upon the first time listening through this album, I was confused, that was true.  Clapping?  Not enough Mike and Chester taking turns with vocals?  By the second time through, I fully appreciated the sound of the album.  It's a breakthrough for them, and I hope it sells well for their sake. <br /> <br />Never reviewed individual songs before, but I'll give it a shot.. grades are out of 10. <br /> <br />Wake 8/10 - good way to start up the album, makes me feel like I'm getting ready for something new.. <br /> <br />Given Up 9/10 - such an energetic song, the clapping really does add to the energy, and includes an obligatory Chester scream for the fans. <br /> <br />Leave Out All The Rest 10/10 - excellent, just, excellent.  The heartfelt lyrics really hit home.  Chester's voice shines here, he seems to have learned to turn down the angst, and just flatout sing. <br /> <br />Bleed It Out 9/10 - as catchy a song they've ever done, Mike and Chester have great chemistry here.  More clapping, but I like it. <br /> <br />Shadow Of The Day 7.5/10 - could have been better, but a good song to showcase a slower side of LP.  Some may say it's too U2-esque, but they tried here. <br /> <br />What I've Done 10/10 - as good as it gets, for the reviewer that mentions this is a mellowed out Numb, not true.  This is nothing like that song, and stands out on its own.  Production on this song is very slick. <br /> <br />Hands Held High 10/10 - Shinoda outdoes himself, this song tugs at the heartstrings.  For beinga political/war song, it does not irritate me like \\"Megalomaniac\\" by Incubus did.  Beautiful song.   <br /> <br />No More Sorrow 9/10 - love the guitar work on this song, don't know what people are talking about when they say there's no anger/emotion on this album. <br /> <br />Valentine's Day 7/10 - good song for the most part, only thing is when Chester starts going into \\"on a valentine's daaayy\\", the cheese factor is too high for me.  If you can mind that, you'll enjoy the song. <br /> <br />In Between 8/10 - decent song for Mike, not one of his better performances, but not lackluster by any stretch <br /> <br />In Pieces 10/10 - sooo goood (\\"How's the pie?\\" Harry Osborn - \\"Sooo goood.\\").  Love the beat, and Chester does a great job on vocals.  When he breaks into the chorus, it's mind numbing. <br /> <br />The Little Things Give You Away 8/10 - it does it's job of ending the album. <br /> <br />All in all, album was excellent, but could have used a few more songs.  It almost seems too short.
B000N6U0DS|4.0|You can feel the love between the Father & Son.  He was determined to make it and he did.  Will Smith and his boy were great!  I rarely comment on any movie but this one got to me.  I held my child pretty much the whole movie.  It makes you realize that you would do anything for your child, and to really be greatful of what you have.
0060007737|4.0|This is a quick read and I actually found myself picking it up to read even when I WANTED to put it down. It has an easy flow and is written in layman's terms so anyone can understand.  And while all of that is wonderful for a book, there is one thing that stood out the most to me-BRANDING IS MADE THROUGH PUBLICITY, NOT ADVERTISING.  I swear I thought it was the other way around.  I thought if you advertise your product enough then the media would pick up on your product and give you the publicity.  That advice right there was worth the price of the book.  If you are an entrepreneur, author or any type of businessperson, this book should be part of your library.  Refer to it often.
B000M4RG42|5.0|I'm in awe of Clint Eastwood once again. This film proves yet again that Eastwood stands alongside Scorsese and Spielberg as one of our greatest living directors. It doesn't surpirse me at all that the average movie goer still knows so little about mise-en-scene, montage, and the storytelling language of film. This film is told in mixed flashbacks. Eastwood chose to challenge the viewer. He used the same narrative structure in his film biopic BIRD. Sometimes great film is not easy for the average moviegoer to decode and appreciate. I understand the impact this has on the viewer. It's not an easy viewing experience. It requires patience and close study at times to fully grasp it's inherent meaning. Great poets do not always rhyme. This is not an Action film. This is a spiritual War Epic about patriotism and man's inhumanity to man. This film only made it onto a few of the major Top Ten Lists for 2006. (Many reserved that honor for Eastwood's LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA.) But, it sure made mine. I don't care about comparisons to SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. (Spielberg is a Producer of this film.) I don't care about the accuracy of this story down to it's most minute detail. What I care about is the connection this film made with me as a human being. I don't wish to delineate the plot yet again. Read another review for that. What I wish to express is the meaning of this film to me. Especially, with Memorial Day approaching. I thought about this film long after having viewed it yesterday. And this is what I took away from this piece:<br /><br />We elevate our Heroes to the status of faceless iconography to satisfy the ideology and needs of this country. All the while, our understanding and concern for The Veterans of this country attenuates. We no longer value the courageous soldier as the individual standardbearer of our freedom, only the ragged war memorials he represents. \\"We The People\\" fail to recognize that the ones lost to us, and the ones that come home to us from burning and savage lands, are really ourselves. Our fathers and sons. Our mothers and daughters. Our brothers and sisters. Our friends and neighbors. If we can't care for these people, how can we care for ourselves?<br /><br />When we speak of patriotism, are we speaking about ourselves? Or, a false iconography that doesn't even represent itself? Patriotism starts at home. What would Twain, or Vonnegut say if they were here? Maybe when we speak of patriotism, we should speak the word humanism.<br /><br />(Politicians today unjustly use our brave soldiers in Iraq to further the agendas of their constituencies in an unjust war under the guise of patriotism, in the very same way our Military unjustly used The Heroes of Iwo Jima and their families during World War II to raise money for a just and patriotic cause. This observation is mine, not Eastwood's.)<br /><br />This poignant and timeless Masterpiece should be viewed as a part of our History for years to come.<br /><br />I would also hold this film up against APOCALYPSE NOW, THE DEER HUNTER, and THE THIN RED LINE as another great spiritually subconscious War Epic.

Our mothers and daughters. Our brothers and sisters. Our friends and neighbors. If we can't care for these people, how can we care for ourselves?    When we speak of patriotism, are we speaking about ourselves? Or, a false iconography that doesn't even represent itself? Patriotism starts at home. What would Twain, or Vonnegut say if they were here? Maybe when we speak of patriotism, we should speak the word humanism.      (Politicians today unjustly use our brave soldiers in Iraq to further the agendas of their constituencies in an unjust war under the guise of patriotism, in the very same way our Military unjustly used The Heroes of Iwo Jima and their families during World War II to raise money for a just and patriotic cause. This observation is mine, not Eastwood's.)    This poignant and timeless Masterpiece should be viewed as a part of our History for years to come.     I would also hold this film up against APOCALYPSE NOW, THE DEER HUNTER, and THE THIN RED LINE as another great spiritually subconscious War Epic. It speaks volumes about man's inhumanity to man.    I absolutely love this film. It's BRILLIANT. It now holds a special place of honor on my shelf and in my heart.    I hope that you're thoughtful when you view this. If you are thoughtful, you might be moved by it. I was moved to tears. This brutal and beautiful film deserves your undivided attention.    Thank you, Mr. Eastwood. BE GOOD TO YOURSELF.
B00004BZ16|5.0|The Clash is one of those bands that are not quite part of reality anymore...they have become a legend not only of music but in the world as a whole. This album says a lot just by the name: sandinista! , its a name that tells the people that there are some serious issues represented on the album, but this is not a motive to be sad ...on the contrary: its a celebration to diferent rythems such as pure rock and roll, gospel, funk, rap, regaee and so much more. I enjoyed it from the first track to the last. Everybody can relate to the lyrics because it they just sing about life- and life is judged in a large amount by politics....but the rythms are so out of this world....it just makes you feel alive and at the same time so happy dispite the fact the the world is so dark and injust....<br /><br />I love this album....and the clash is one of the best bands this world has ever seen.
B000784WMW|5.0|This particular adaptation of the novel remains my all-time favorite. The screenplay stays very true to the book, the acting is very good, and the portrayal of mid-19th century English society, living conditions, class differences, etc. is very well done.
B000M4RG42|2.0|Unfortunately for me, I purchased this DVD without first seeing the movie. With Clint Eastwood's track record, there's no way, I thought, that this could be anything but fantastic. That was a bad assumption on my part.<br /><br />This movie is dog slow getting out of the gate. Soon though the invasion begins, and it's everything you would expect---awesome in every way. But then...<br /><br />BAMM<br /><br />Eastwood kills the action, COLD TURKEY. He flashes ahead, after the battle, to tell the story of how the now-famous flag raising photograph wasn't what everyone thought. After spending some time there, he returns to battle. That's fine and all, but it ruined it for this reviewer. Consequently, I could never get my head back into the movie.<br /><br />On my first viewing, not being able to stand another minute of this snoozer, I stopped it at the 92 minute mark. Two days later, I purposed myself to finish the movie. It was to no avail--- the movie was a painful bore. Regardless of this, the boredom could have been overcome had the movie made an effort to help me care about the individuals involved in the story. It never got there though---There just isn't any meat to the characters---not a single one.<br /><br />Skip this movie, and you will be no worse for doing so.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|It is a must for every parent to watch it together with their kids and extended family. It brings you up to speed with whats hapenning on our entire world to shake your guts and move you to do something now to stop the overall global warming and its desvastating consequences. Though the theme is technical and scientific in its content, it is so brilliantly and so accessibly presented that it could be understood by the average citizen. It could also be used for further discussion and study in community, church, school and other groups.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I was only able to watch bits and pieces of this documentary on the Discovery Channel so I bought the DVD set so I could see it all. <br />And seeing it all and then some is what documentary series  offers. <br />Everyone , young and old alike, should watch this. <br />It is absolutely brilliant! <br />
1594489505|3.0|In a backdrop of the Soviet War in Afghanistan, adversaries form an unlikely bond based on a common fate: suffering cruelty at the hands of a man they fear. The story line in Hosseini's second novel is straightforward and contains fewer overly coincidental plot elements than his first, but simplicity may be its one criticism: at several key points, the reader can easily predict what will happen next. Additionally, through a string of misfortunes befalling several characters, inexplicably, the reader may not be moved much emotionally at their fates. This second novel set in Afghanistan, which women may enjoy more than men, is another enjoyable read, but is not as good as The Kite Runner. Great companion reads: The bookseller of Kabul by Årne Seierstad; Zinky Boys - Soviet Voices from the Afghanistan War by Svetlana Alexievich; The Looming Tower by Lawrence Wright; 102 Minutes by Jim Dwyer and Kevin Flynn; and a fantastic story set in Germany, related only by its wartime theme and tragedy affected friendship, The Book Thief by Markus Zusak.
B000KJU1HI|5.0|I always wanted to have this film; and now it's even better. It was a movie that was only seen by a few; now it can be seen by everyone. Thanx for having it.
B000LC4CVA|3.0|After listening numerous times to the original Celtic Woman album, leaped at the chance to see the 2nd.  I enjoyed the music (would give the music 4 stars) but distracted by the video.  I finished the DVD glad that I borrowed rather than bought it.  I would listen to the music, but never watch again.
B00003CWTI|3.0|These intertwining tales are full of anger, tragedy, obscenity, incontinence, and a rain of frogs. Where is the joy? Where (except in the final minute) is the redemption of the human spirit? Can the world really be this messed up - and even if it is, how is this entertainment? <br /> <br />Sorry. I was looking for drama and interesting stories; I got 3+ hours of depression and despair. Despite the fine acting by most of the cast, I truly don't understand what anyone would like about this movie.
0143038419|5.0|I loved travelling alongside the author and the book was really self-reflective too.
B000K7VHQE|4.0|When I first saw this film, I was mightily disapointed. It had been pushed as a comedy, so I expected to, you know, laugh. I didn't. Well, not until the pagent scene. The look on Greg Kinnear's face was priceless, and pretty well summed-up my view of such pagents. <br /> <br />But I could tell there was something good in this movie, so about a month later I watched it again, and was much happier. The performances by the entire cast were wonderful, particularly Alan Arkin. I was also pleased by the directing. Dayton and Farris have come a long way since their days of music videos (of course, some of the ones they made were for the Smashing Pumpkins, my favorite band of all-time). <br /> <br />I still find the film a bit twee at times. The characters are all Quirky in that indie film way. Which at least is better than being QUIRKY!, though not as good as simply being interesting. <br /> <br />Still, though, at this point my only real complaint about the movie was that they missed a chance for a great inside joke. For those of you who are movie fans, imagine the fun in them driving into Scotsdale and someone saying to Greg Kinnear's character, \\"Isn't this where Bob Crane died?\\"
B000MR9D5E|5.0|It is a visual feast. In addition to the beautiful images, the narration doesn't take up too much space, it is meaningful and shares many interesting points of view sometimes in a poetic way. The background music is equal in quality to both the images and the wonderful story telling. I have seen literally hundreds of nature videos in my life, but this is so much better than any other that it is like the difference between watching the sunrise and turning on a light bulb!
B000002U9L|5.0|I have to disagree with  the first reviewer of this film/soundtrack.   This movie/soundtrack appeals to  EVERYONE'S fantasies and imagination. The Soundtrack is amazing as is the movie. Entertaining to anyone wether it be  male or female. David Bowie is amazing and proofs it in this soundtrack.
B00000HZFH|5.0|After my third listen today to this album I felt the need to write this review.  It is interesting that the reviewers who didn't like this album generally liked \\"Perfect From Now On.\\"  I think the other BTS albums are fair to good, but I consider \\"Keep It Like a Secret\\" to be a masterpiece.  The chord progressions and the layered guitar work bring a deep sweetness to the music.  The songs are groovy, rocking, and mellow all at the same time.  I'm not talking about incredible speed like Yngwie; it's that he does it just right and it sounds fantastic.  Go ahead and say that he's not that great of a guitarist.  It's just like the joke about how many guitarists does it take to screw in a light bulb:  twenty one.  One to screw it in and twenty to say, \\"I can do that.\\"  I am very glad I investigated this band further.  This is their best album, and one of the best albums I have ever heard.  It has five or six songs that are excellent, whereas one might consider an album with three or four decent songs to be a \\"good\\" album.  The next time I go to my part time job at night I am going to play this cd accordingly:  track 1, volume 9; track 2, volume 8, tracks 3 and 4, volume 10, and I'll have to see after that.
0767020308|4.0|This is relatively true to the book, much moreso than the Paltrow version. However, like the book, it may be a bit heavy for some viewers. They won't, for example, see Mr. Knightley as a romantic hero. The acting is good, and the story is great. It's a wonderful way to introduce someone to this work, by Ms. Austen, and would be wonderfully paired with something like Clueless, so that one can see how the story transcends time.<br /><br />(*)>
B000I2J5UG|5.0|Love the \\"fuzzy box\\". You get the Black Parade album (explicit-tho the \\"clean\\" version is really not) and an in-depth booklet journey into the minds and madness from writing the album at the haunted hotel \\"The Paramour\\". Some of the songs are explained by various group members. We see into the thoughts of a very cool band on top of their game doubting themselves on the eve of a tour explosion in 2006/7-they did not see the overwhelming response it would bring around the world. Wish it had been released first or I had known about the collector set first-now I have 3, yes, 3 Black Parade CD's (original-which is now scratched to pieces from overplay, fuzzy box CD & \\"Clean\\" version which I still can't play at work. Get the box-definitely.
6305907145|4.0|I am always challenged in finding any kind of romance in the characters of Mansfield Park. They are cousins. Back in Ms. Austen's day, this was cool. To me, it is SO not.<br /><br />This telling of the story, however, is really fun. I love the dramatic pauses at the end. I love the nasty Mrs. Norris. I love the artful Crawfords and the artless Edmund. Most of all, I LOVE Fanny, the smart creative Fanny that is presented in this movie. She totally makes the movie.<br /><br />(*)>
B00006EXL5|5.0|Raw, haunting. Any MCR fan must have this in his/her collection. The only song added that would make it a 6 is \\"Sister to Sleep\\" as it exists today (recorded as either a demo or at a club by someone). You will play it over and over and won't be able to help yourself. BUY IT ABSOLUTELY.
1400032717|5.0|My MIL tried to get me to read this book a few years ago, and I politely declined. This year, I was required to read it for a course I am sitting. This is the first time in a long time I've utterly enjoyed reading course material.<br /><br />Mr. Haddon is utterly believable in the voice of Christopher, a teenaged autistic boy. By the end of the book, one is more than empathetic; one can almost understand how Christopher thinks. It's an amazing look into the world of autism.<br /><br />I found the text very easy to read and very interesting. And it didn't have an ending that made me mad. Totally worth reading. Just goes to show I should have listened to my mother in law years ago.<br /><br />(*)>
B00025ETIW|5.0|This one has a range from very Metallica-ish (Bury Me in Black)-good hooks and riffs to \\"Interlude\\" acoustic & pure. Has the big hits like \\"Helena\\"-the tribute to Gerard & Mikey's Grandma and \\"I'm not okay\\"-fun to sing in heavy traffic. Bet you'll see several of these on a \\"best hits\\" if ever there should be one in the future. Yet, another must have.
B00005MP58|5.0|This BBC telling of Pride and Prejudice is perfect. It is true to the story, the actors are fantastic, the sets and costumes seem to be more authentic than other P&P renditions. THough it is a long haul (6 hours), it's a retelling of a long book, so it does a good, relatively thorough job. One can understand the motivations of the characters and the plot points much better than in other versions, which are so compressed for time.<br /><br />At the same time, it manages not to be stuffy, but to carry over the humor inherent in this classic tale. It is one of the main reasons I picked up a Jane Austen book (I never read Austen in school, and nothing had drawn me to her before). For that reason, it is one of my favorite movies, ever.<br /><br />(*)>
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Great cinematography and narration -- this type of movie should be aired, and then followed -up with a discussion on global warming. The CD series shows just how beautiful a planet we live on; too bad it's being ruined by nations not heeding the messages about global warming.
0743496728|5.0|I can't believe how my perspective changed as I read this. I gave this to a young lady in our office who is only a few years out of High School to try and get her take on the whole bully thing. Really made me question the assumption that the villain is a monster. Wish there was a rainbow somewhere in this, maybe if they made this required reading for all bullies, there could be more happy endings. This is not an easy read, but it is powerful and profound!
0743482832|5.0|This play is a fantasy and romance.  The story is of a wise old magician and his unworldly daughter.  There is a gallant young prince and a cruel, scheming brother.  It is very much like a fairy tale written in Shakespeare's wonderful prose.  In it ancient wrongs are righted and true lovers live happily ever after.  The play is also an allegory, and it holds so much of Shakespeare's mature reflections on life.  It is enjoyable.
141694740X|5.0|I think this is such a great book. I love its honest and straighforward  <br />approach. My past experiences often looked like this - I would make excuses for the men I dated, and then I took responsibilty for their actions rather than looking at the situation honestly.  <br /> <br />There is a great quote by Maya Angelou which says \\"People show you who they are, so believe them.\\"   Thanks to her and these  <br />two authors - I now choose to believe them.  This book made it really clear for me - I want to be with someone who is into me!  <br /> <br />Another book which talks about taking responsibility for yourself and the  <br />relationships you have is  called \\"How To Create a Magical Relationship\\" by Ariel and Shya Kane. The Kanes' honest approach gives the possibility of creating and keeping a magical relationship.   <br /> <br />I highly recommend reading these books.  Life is short - go for what you want.
B000099T3P|1.0|The special effects in this movie are jokes. The creatures look exactly like furry puppets. The video quality is a shame. It's faded and grainy. The acting is like that of a bad movie show. The Gremlins is more exciting, interesting and entertaining. I regret I bought it even though it cost me only $10.
6301969413|4.0|I see by all the other reviews there is little else I can add--those guys, they beat me to it!<br /><br />1.  Rock Hudson did his second best acting I remember (Martian Chronicals was his best, I think).  Jim Brown came off perfectly as a marine Captain who worked his way up through the ranks rather than being appointed to his position--no nonsense, good.  Patrick McGoohan was a perfect British agent--he reminded me of the British agent in Where Eagles Dare (you wonder if they're all like that?).  Ernest Borgnine could always act as far as I can remember--fine job.<br /><br />2.  Writing is fine.<br /><br />3.  Storyline, above average.<br /><br />4.  Special effects, realistic.<br /><br />5.  Best scene is the torpedo room flooding--some tense moments there.<br /><br />There are no CONS: in this movie for those of you who like this type of movie.  I think everybody else would give it a three star rating if they don't like this type of movie.  Either way I don't see any real short comings to this movie so I recommend it. Bye!<br /><br />Buy, don't rent--it's a classic.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|One of the best purchases I have ever made. We need more Blu Ray filmed animal specials and other nature films.
B000001ED1|5.0|I bought this CD after hearing One of Us on the radio.  I was very pleasantly surprised to find the CD was a collection of great rock and blues.  Great Blues tracks include Pensacola and Crazy Baby.  Right Hand Man and Spider Web are great rocking tracks. <br /> <br />I'd recommend this to anyone who loves either genere.
B000P6YNSE|4.0|\\"Lost\\" ended its second season with a bang... literally. The hatch violently imploded, and Kate, Sawyer and Jack were captured by the Others.<br /><br />And so the third season is all about the repercussions of those events. It lags badly in the first half, but shocking predictions and new arrivals on the island add fresh twists -- and some stunning answers -- to the twisty, surreal storyline. But there's still plenty left for the remaining three seasons.<br /><br />Kate and Sawyer are put to work, then locked up in gorilla cages, while Jack is similarly imprisoned inside an Other compound --  and finds that he is there to be a doctor to the sinister Ben, who is suffering from a spinal tumor. Jack finds himself suspended between two Others -- Ben and the mysterious Juliet --  and unsure what to do, or who to trust.<br /><br />The tensions between the Others and castaways become worse as Kate and Sawyer escape, and she mounts a rescue to find Jack. But even when they get him (and the disgraced Juliet) back, things don't improve -- Juliet is secretly spying for Ben, Desmond has terrible visions of Charlie's demise, and the newly solo Locke forces Ben to reveal the island's greatest secret -- Jacob, a mysterious power that commands the Others like a god.<br /><br />Suddenly a woman parachutes onto the island, and tells the castaways that a ship is only a few miles out to sea. As the Others fragment and turn against each other, the survivors decide to take them out once and for all, while Charlie and Desmond set off to infiltrate an underwater hatch. But there will be shocking losses on both sides, as Jack is faced with the most important decision he may ever make....<br /><br />\\"Lost\\" still has plenty of unsolved, unanswered mysteries, and the first half of the season is frustratingly slow and oblique. No answers, at all. But it picks up and answers questions in the second half, including who ruined Sawyer's life, who commands the Others, and the relationship between Dharma Corporation and the Others and why they protect the island so fiercely.<br /><br />The writing for the first half is pretty lax (major questions are answered with non-answers like \\"We watch\\"), but later on it tightens up considerably, with dozens of seemingly unrelated plot threads coming together in the battle with the Others. Locke's dad, Desmond's checkered past, Rousseau's daughter and Sun's pregnancy are only a few of them.<br /><br />But despite all the personal drama (enough about the love triangle!), the stories are still full of gritty action (including Sayid killing a man with just his feet), and increasingly twisted flashbacks that let us see the pre-crash lives of the islanders.  These had gotten kinda stale, but Desmond's timeslip makes it seem fresher, as does the revelation of how Ben became King of the Magic Island. It answers a lot of questions too.<br /><br />And there's the occasional loss. Two beloved characters bite the big one in this season, and the handling of their deaths is enough to bring tears to your eyes. But there's some humor as well -- usually provided by Hurley, who revives an old van, triumphs at Ping-pong, and even gets to be the rescuing cavalry. Not to mention the wry, solid dialogue (\\" If it was Rousseau's, a massive rock would be flying at my head right now\\").<br /><br />Matthew Fox and Evangeline Lilly turn in some solid performances as the increasingly tormented castaways. But Dominic Monaghan and Henry Ian Cusick really rule the acting front, with their poignant struggles with love for their respective girlfriends, and the angst that Desmond's visions bring to them both. And Josh Holloway does a brilliant job, especially in the harrowing, claustrophobic episode in \\"The Brig.\\"<br /><br />The first half of \\"Lost's\\" third season is decidedly tepid -- not terrible, but flabby.

B000QXDED6|5.0|Frank Miller adaptations are on a roll. First we got \\"Sin City,\\" and now we have the story of three hundred Spartans who repelled a massive invasion.<br /><br />And the adaptation of \\"300\\" is a stunning one -- literally stunning, since it bombards the viewer with larger-than-life characters, smashing visuals and tight direction. It goes a bit too fast for its own good, but it's a truly epic film that takes the historical war movie to another level -- all the more so because it actually happened.<br /><br />As the introduction tells us, the Spartans were the ultimate warrior people. Babies were inspected for weakness or faults, and killed if they had any; as they were growing up, they were taught and toughened by a savage regimen. Their only true hope was to \\"die beautifully\\" for their land.<br /><br />A Persian messenger arrives, telling King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) that the god-king Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) wants the Spartans to bow to him. Leonidas' response: shove the Persians into a pit. But before he can go to war, he must consult the corrupt priesthood of Ephors and their beautiful Oracle. She predicts that Sparta will fall and the gods forbid war at the approach of the Carneaian festival -- courtesy of a hefty bribe from a Spartan traitor.<br /><br />So Leonidas takes out three hundred of his best men, along with their nervy Arcadian allies, and begin trouncing the Persians. But they are being sabotaged, both by a hunchbacked outcast and by a treacherous councilor, whom Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey) is battling. And so at Thermopylae, Leonidas prepares for a final battle against the monstrous Persian Army -- knowing that their story of freedom will live on.<br /><br />This is not a \\"sensitive\\" movie where you have any appreciation for the bad guys -- it's a glorification of three hundred soldiers who died for their land and freedom. It just wouldn't work otherwise. It doesn't blindly adore the Spartans -- we see their darker side in their \\"weed out the weak\\" policy -- but it does appreciate them. They respect and care about each other, and Leonidas is as kind as he can be even to Ephialtes, the traitor.<br /><br />And it's done in a manner appropriate to its comic book origins -- grimy, bloody and epic, but with a stylized look that is almost like CGI. The battles are shockingly good, and full of fantasy-ish creations like the monstrous creatures or the silver-masked Immortals. Even a wall of corpses. But we also get some beautiful visuals as well -- roiling seas, sunlit battlefields, Spartan cities, and the drugged Oracle in her white veil.<br /><br />While the script gets a bit over-the-top at times, it's hard not to be moved by dialogue that can be darkly funny (\\"It's just an eye. The gods saw fit to grace me with a spare\\") or stirring (\\"He did not wish tribute, nor song, or monuments or poems of war and valor. His wish was simple: \\"Remember us.\\" That was his hope, should any free soul come across that place, in all the countless centuries yet to be\\").<br /><br />Butler and Headey are simply great as Leonidas and Gorgo -- they're both strong, passionate and fearless, and they both do a great job in their separate storylines. But the movie is filled with good performances -- David Wenham as the narrator, Dominic West as a disgusting traitor, Santoro as the decadent, arrogant god-king, and many others.<br /><br />\\"300\\" is a unique, stirring, stunning movie that pushes the action-movie envelope, and gives a thrilling edge to a real-life story of overwhelming power.

B000IJ79WU|5.0|Richard Donner gets emotional about his movie, and rightly so.  This is the better of the two versions, Listers being a campy rehash of the prologue and a few comedic dirogotive new yorkers and hicks added in place of some classy elements.  Stamp's General Zod is much more sinister and presentable here as a more formable foe to Superman, as he should be.  Ursa and Zod's lines are adde in place of some campy new yorkers corn ball coments and the silly coke sign stuff.  The Superman transforming into human scene has more meaning here and is more on the lines of father/son ethos and has more wieght.  The morbid skull scene is removed for superman and replaced with an already fully dressed Kent BEFORE entering the red chamber instead of the fanciful change clothes metomophisis crap in the Lister film edits.  Cute louis outfit.  Who cares if the love scene is played out before, not after his humanization he's superman, not an animal, the purpose of this is not to reduce the sex labedo of a krytonian alien, but to have a long term relationship with Louis..  What would the nieghbors think...
1594489505|5.0|Mariam's life revolves around her father's visits. While she lives in a hut with her mother, it's the weekly visits from her father that are the light of her existence. All that changes when she turns fifteen and is forced to marry an older man she has never met. Rasheed lives on the other side of the country, so Miriam leaves behind the only people she has ever known to live with a stranger. Rasheed is a strict man, and Miriam finds herself with restrictions on her new life.<br /><br />On the day the Soviets invade Afghanistan, another woman is born. Laila is raised in a progressive family. Her father encourages her to learn as much as she can in school. Her mother suffers from depression and leaves her alone most of the time. Her best friend is a neighbor boy, Tariq, who lost a leg to a land mine years earlier.<br /><br />Laila lives just down the street from Mariam, yet they hardly interact until the struggle for control in Afghanistan brings tragedy to their street. Then their lives become irrevocably linked. Despite the 19 years age difference between them, a strong bond of friendship is formed. Will it be enough to endure the hardship ahead?<br /><br />I tend to stick to light entertainment and rarely read the more serious works of literature. However, several friends I respect loved Khaled Hosseini's first novel, so I decided to give this one a try. And I'm glad I did.<br /><br />This book isn't light entertainment by any stretch of the imagination. The writing style produces an almost melancholy air right from the start.<br /><br />I tend to read plot heavy books, so this character study was a definite change of pace for me. I found the first half slow going at times, mainly because I knew where the story was going. Once I got into the second half, things really picked up. The ending was very bittersweet. I couldn't think of a better way to end it.<br /><br />Not to say I wasn't interested before then. Mariam and Laila are two very real, interesting characters. I felt for them and became a very real part of their struggles over the course of the book.<br /><br />Adding to the book's richness is the historical background. The novel covers 40 years of Afghani history. While that is never the focus of the novel, it is an ever present backdrop to the personal struggle of the two women. We in the west often forget how much we truly have to be thankful for. Here, we get a picture of life in the midst of a civil war and under an oppressive regime.<br /><br />I can understand why my friends were so taken with Hosseini's first novel. I know I will read it at some point. This new book comes highly recommended.esting characters.

B000059XVS|4.0|My VHS tape of Lawrence of Arabia arrived quickly and had no noticable flaws.  However, when I viewed the video, I found a 30 second section on the second tape that was damaged.  Otherwise, the tape was very good.
0767802659|4.0|This is hard one to nail down.  It is fun, campy, it makes you wonder what you would do if this was really real.  A little on the gory side, but you can understand where the characters are coming from; I have felt like several of them.  Lots of action, fun and friends that don't usually enjoy this kind of movie has watched and enjoyed it.
B000O174CM|5.0|Boy, I was totally blown over by the movie version of the Tony Award-Winning production of DREAMGIRLS. This award-winning film featured a cast that pulled out all the stops to out on a great cinematic classic. I saw this film twice and the music just stuck with me for ever and I still have the tunes playing wherever I go. Beyonce Knowles who played Deena Jones was great, especially towards the end of the film where she tires of being controlled by Curtis Taylro, played by Oscar Winner, Jaime Foxx. Eddie Murphy was fantastic as James \\"Thunder\\" Early, who reminded me a lot of the late James Brown. Akina Rose electrifies as Lorell Robinson,. But, without a doubt, Jennifer Hudson really shines as Effie White and deserved her Golden Globe/Oscar victories for her role, especially when belting out the show's signature song, \\"And I Am Telling You, I'm Not Going.\\"  It is remeniscent to Barbra Streisand's performances of \\"I'm The Greatest Star\\" from FUNNY GIRL and \\"How Lucky Can You Get\\" from FUNNY LADY.  <br /> <br />I urge all of you to pick up a copy of DREAMGIRLS to see this gem. It is indeed a show stopping event and one of the best films to come from Broadway to Hollywood. It joins the many movie musical classics such as FUNNY GIRL, MY FAIR LADY, GREASE, THE SOUND OF MUSIC, WEST SIDE STORY, THE WIZ, ANNIE, HELLO DOLLY, EVITA, and many other hits.  This classic is NOT to be missed and I give it a 100!  And remember, all you've got to do is dream..... <br />

1596680199|5.0|I am not a beginner to Polymer Clay and have many other books. I ordered this book just in case there was something new in it for me. Well there was, plenty. Even the tip for storing clay  was liberating. Why had I not thought of such a simple way of storing my clay so that I could see what was in my stash at a glance? The step by step instructions are really clear and  cover some of the gaps not covered in other books. A beginner would be well served by the clear inspirational bead ideas in this book as would a more experienced clayer. The  images are clear and the layout is very user friendly. Well done. If you are a bead fanatic this a a great book.
0743496728|4.0|I picked up this book exactly 3 days after the Virginia Tech Killings. I had no idea this book was about school shootings, I probably would not have started reading it if I had. I picked up this book searching for some form of escapism, maybe a little bit of romance, something light. I only vaguely remembered The Pact which I had read years ago when I was still in high school, so I cannot say i was really familiar with Jodi Picoult as an author. Anyhow, this book was simply shocking, all of her books which I have read this far concern some kind of trial or legal issue.  My only comment is that some of her trial portrayals and legal procedure are a bit unreal. I found myself torn, between wanting to hate Peter for what he did and with that have my own person to funnel my own feelings about what happened in VT,but in the end it was impossible to hate anyone. I think thats what Ms. Picoult accomplishes best by using different narrators, you get to see the world for a few pages through the eyes of every character, which enables you to sympathize, and find some common ground with each of them. I found myself rooting for Peter in some way, desperately hoping his mother would do something already to give him the confidence booster so he sees that he's worth it, and then hating him for being so selfish as to have taken the life of another. Peter started out as a monster in my mind, and I hated him as soon as I found out he had killed all those people.  <br />For a long time after I read this book, its like I had to put it far away and not even look at it, because my emotions were that strong.I strongly recommend this book and have now become an avid reader of Jodi Picoult's literature.
0156027321|5.0|If you like Survivor, Lost or Cast Away, you will probably enjoy Life of Pi. I listened to it as an audiobook and enjoyed it very much. Kerry Shale's reading as well as his great ability with Indian and other accents made this book a joy to listen to.<br /><br />The story is told from the point of view of an Indian-Canadian man regarding an adventure he had at age 16. As the son of a zoo owner he has a very interesting life that you will enjoy reading about especially if you like zoology. There are some fantastical elements to the story that might turn some realists off as well as religious elements that might turn other people off and also a bit of blood and gore which might turn yet other people off. You have to realize though, its a survival story so its a bit unrealistic NOT to expect gross stuff.<br /><br />I also wanted to counter a common thread in some reviews complaining that part 1 of the book does not really tie in to parts 2 or 3. I believe part 1 is meant to be a contrast, a view of normalcy versus the chaos that ensued and the resolution that followed.<br /><br />i believe that this book is safe for children of any age to read so long as you the parent have a good grasp on how much gore your kid can handle. You should read the book first just in case though.
B000MRA5NS|5.0|I won't bore you too much with a technical review here.  This is simply the best looking Bluray movie I own.  Watching in 1080p, this movie is easily one of the best looking I have.  My new showcase DVD along with Planet Earth.(Certain parts of Planet Earth anyway.)  As far as the movie itself it is a very intelligent James Bond movie that answers alot of questions about why Bond is how he is.  He makes all the rookie mistakes and is introduced to his future tradmarks (Shaken not stirred martini etc).  Daniel Craig makes a great James Bond.  Kinda proves that the character is not about looks but acting and Craig captures the spirit of James Bond completly. (I should also mention that it has one of the best foot chase scenes Iv'e ever seen in a movie.  Almost Jackie Chan ish but without the comedy.)
B000OONTFU|2.0|I purchased this set over the cheaper version as it came with \\"The Animatrix\\" (a movie I already own on standard DVD) well guess what, the Animatrix on this so called \\"Ultimate Collection\\" is in standard old school crappy def! Needless to say I feel ripped off. Oh and to rub salt in the wound I could have got the cheaper version and downloaded Animatrix for free from Xbox Live Marketplace! Way to go guys, totally screw the folks who pay more for a box set. <br /> <br />This isnt the \\"Ultimate Collection\\" as all movies are not in HD !!!! (I dont care about the stupid making of 1000 hours of babble stuff) If someone starts a petition to get the HD Animatrix (as a free replacement) Im sooo signing it this sucks.
0316776963|5.0|I bought this book several years ago on a whim.  I was about to board an international flight and was at the airport bookstore with limited time.  The title looked interesting, so I tried it.  I have since read it two more times.  It makes me laugh out loud every time!  The Rooster story made me double over with laughter.  I can hear his brother's voice in my head.  My husband kept looking at me during our flight like I was nuts. I also enjoyed the language breakdowns in his french class.  Loved it!
B000N4SHOE|4.0|Beatrix Potter is the author/illustrator reponsible for such children's classics as Jemima Puddleduck and Peter Rabbit.  Edwardian London is beautifully evoked and the film is so intimately photographed you have the feeling of being right there with the characters. <br /> <br />In a stellar cast working at the top of their form, Renee Zellweger is excellent as the eponymous Miss Potter, fighting both for professional success and for the right to her own personal life.  Particularly frustrating is her interaction with her mother, a woman determined to denigrate and diminish both these goals, owing to her own narrow moral compass. <br /> <br />But apart from Potter's professional success and emotional blooming, there is another aspect which renders this woman remarkable.  Her success allowed her the financial resources to buy vast acres of farmland and she did so, as an agriculturist and conservationist - to protect the land from greedy developers.  Even without her classic illustrations (done in an updated \\"Mary Poppins\\" style wtih witty and relevant interactions)  her role as a conservationist would assure her lasting fame and credit. <br /> <br />Beautiful and inspiring film.
B000K4X2UQ|2.0|First of all, great classic live album... BUT where are the bonus tracks from the rest of the show(s)?!  All of these versions have been released before.  There is surely space because this is spread out over 2 CD's.  That might have justified the $43.00 price tag.  The diehard fans need more!!!  C'mon Coverdale!!!!  By the way, the new Whitesnake sucks!
B000P12LWY|5.0|I am a history dork as well. But I don't think you need to be to love this series! It's beautifully made, and suprisingly accurate (in a world where so many series and movies are completely inaccurate it's a refreshing change). I was hooked after the first episode, I saw the first two online and then I was so addicted that I actually upgraded to digital cable so that I could see the rest! It's a fabulous series, I just hope that they keep it going for a long time to come.
032147404X|5.0|This book is a very good compilation of practical photography tips especially for a novice like me. It is very easy to read, understand and apply in real life. In no time I am starting to shoot good photos and post-process them. It is not filled with photography jargons that would intimidate a beginner; rather it will make the novice (and seasoned alike) become inspired and excited with digital photography. I speak from experience.
1582701709|1.0|Nothing new here, just repackaged eastern mysticism, with one major flaw (again): the spiritual element is removed to make way for materialism. You can't have it both ways.
B000H4JGZY|5.0|From the first song to the last I couldn't stop listening to this CD.  His first CD was worn out just the same.  On this particular CD, my favorite had to be \\"My Love\\".  Most of his songs fade nicely into the next song so 3 into 4 is my fav.  Great music.  I hope he keeps it up.
B000I2MRHE|5.0|We received the garden gym as a gift and loved it instantly.  Even though it was a little early, I would place my 3 week old on it and just spin her around, playing with each item.  The fact that it was an \\"activity\\" and she didn't cry made it an instant hit in our house.  Now that she is almost four months old, she is enjoying it even more.  Its a great alternative to an activity mat, as the babies can actually see the colors and toys, while the \\"potato chip\\" spinner allows them to see a variety of things as opposed to being stuck with one vision.  I will definately buy this gift for all of my friends who have new babies.

B000OCXMAE|2.0|This album can't and doesn't compare to there first two. It isn't a Rock album but a \\"Lite\\" Rock Album. Which also has two rock songs and two rap/rock songs on it that coincidently also happen to be the best songs.  <br /> <br />The other songs consist of primarily ballads and a few songs that will just plain put you to sleep. Theres nothing wrong with the lighter Rock that should typically show off the singers vocals. Instead of off the charts vocals like we know Chester Bennington can do they are pretty dull just like the music.  <br /> <br />Your not going to hear much but averageness if you listen to this entire album.

B00004Y6O7|5.0|This is a great VH album to own. It has the same musical \\"cool factor\\" as their self-titled debut and 1984. If for nothing else, you'll be able to play the cool instrumental \\"Sunday Afternoon In The Park\\" over and over again. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, I'm very disappointed that in this \\"digitally remastered\\" version the record company did not fix the sound level problems in a couple of the songs. These problems also appeared on the original vinyl record. The volume in \\"So This Is Love?\\" goes up an down several times, which is very noticeable and annoying. And it was/is not an artistic flare. The song starts at a good level with the bass line and drums, and then they are turned down for the guitar and vocals. Not a good effect. It seems like a poor editing decision. It would have been better to have all the music and vocals at the same recorded volume. The same volume \\"errors\\" happen on the next song, an instrumental -- \\"Sunday Afternoon In The Park.\\" But I suppose on that song that you could want it to get louder from time to time as an effect. It's very abrupt, though, and, as a result, not that impressive. They should have spent a little time with some digital audio software and fixed the problems. However, it is faithful to the original. <br /> <br />Even with the audio issue on a couple songs, you should have this album in your VH collection. I still give it 5 stars. \\"Mean Street,\\" \\"Unchained,\\" and \\"So This Is Love?\\" are classic songs. \\"Dirty Movies,\\" \\"Sinner's Swing,\\" and \\"Push Comes To Shove\\" add to the cool-factor of the album. I think I can speak for everyone who heard this album for the first time in the 80s, that \\"Sunday Afternoon In The Park\\" was an instrumental that just blew us all away because it was so cool and different; everyone talked about it at one time or another.
B000MGVCFY|5.0|If anything, this final CD reissue of the Moody Blues initial seven records will remind the listener how vital Mike Pinder was to the Moody Blues. On each track of Seventh Sojourn, his arrangements come to fore, his stamp is on each track. The wispy figure  in \\"New Horizons\\", the swirls in \\"You and me\\" and \\"Singer in a rock and roll band\\", the thick flute sounds of \\"My Lady\\". These are some of Pinders most imaginative moments in Moody Blues history. <br />He also provides the much-needed edge on this release, compensating for the rather sedate predecessor \\"Every Good Boy\\". On Seventh  Pinder uses a Chamberlain to great effect, producing a cleaner, brighter, less murky sound than the mellotron used on subsequent recordings. Pinder also opts for one of the few bona-fide Justin Hayward guitar solo's (and a memorable one) on his composition \\"When You're a Free Man\\". <br />\\"Seventh\\" was recorded during a period of band fatigue. Like the Beatles, they had spent most of the early adult life together.  The liner notes detail the unusual length of time (for the Moodies) spent in 1972 on completing this eight song album. <br />Fans will not want to miss the 4 bonus tracks.  The never before released 8 minute version of \\"Life Strange' is the first highlight- opening  with a piano count in omitted in the standard release.  The clarity of this version is better, one can hear the pump organ breathing and wheezing through the track. . However, the big surprise is when after the oboe fade sequence Pinder's Chamberlain swoops in to begin a 2 minute instrumental section.  As is, it seems to have been left unfinished-to these ears, it seems to have been laid down as the background for a big guitar solo. It's assumed the band decided to leave this section off the track before atempting overdubs. <br />The \\"Lost World\\" instrumental demo is another revelation and the highlight of this release. It opens quite differently than the released version with a prominent, ominous guitar riff, andhas a slight 70s soul sound to it. (Not too surprising, considering Pinders r&b roots.) The drumming also has more of a soul feel to it, and it really stands as a track on its on-it would fit nicely into a soundtrack. <br />\\"Island\\" appears to be an abandoned track with a scratch vocal, the chorus is not developed,  (Justin Hayward scats this section) and what remains is a basic backing track with a neat ascending Chamberlain figure that repeats in intensity until the end of the track.   What is also interesting about this track is that the band recorded this as early as Feb 1973- only a few months after \\"Seventh Sojourn\\" had hit the top of the charts.   The liner notes make no mention of any other recording attempts after \\"Island\\" and after a long lull of seeming inactivity the band embarked on a world tour (perhaps obliged by contractual reasons) in Sept. 1973 ending in Feb. 74 in San Francisco. <br />One hopes a live concert from one of the 74 concerts is eventually released. The song selection was challenging (the concert opened with \\"Higher and Higher\\" which morphed into \\"Out and In\\", and numbers such as \\"Eternity Road\\", \\"One More Time to Live\\",\\"Watching and Wating\\" and an extended \\"Legend of a Mind\\" were performed.) <br />
B000OCXMAE|2.0|Let me first say that I am 25 years old and that I listen to well over 500 different 'modern' rock bands (both mainstream and indie). Bands keep trying new things lately (Silverchair, Evanescence, Finger Eleven, Linkin Park, etc.) and failing miserably at it. And I get so tired of all the fickle music fans who keep encouraging the bands by making excuses for them by saying they are \\"maturing\\" when they abandon the very sound that gained them the fans that they have in the first place. There are hundreds of bands out there who can do the \\"maturing\\" style naturally and flawlessly that these people want to hear instead and should search them out rather than praising the mutatians of the good mainstream bands. Anyways onto the album. Track #1 is \\"Wake\\", a short and boring intro. Then we hear the eye-rollingly embarassing clapping/jingling keys for the next track called \\"Given Up\\". This song is about as \\"heavy\\" as you get on MINUTES TO MIDNIGHT, but it is a song that could have been written by countless other bands. Next is \\"Leave Out All The Rest\\". I think this was the only song where the band tapped into their past potential to release a radio hit. Once this song hits the airwaves as a single, it will more than likely be the biggest hit from this album (not that that is saying a whole lot though...it still stands pale next to their past hits). But it's catchy, memorable and would have mass radio appeal. \\"Bleed It Out\\" is a song with a catchy guitar line, but that is the only thing this song has going for it. The chorus is horrible. Also the stupid Linkin Park hoedown hand clapping is back. \\"Shadow Of The Day\\" is a song that would have been far better to be released by a band such as Jimmy Eat World, The Juliana Theory, Mae or The Panic Division (all good bands that know what they sound best playing, apparently unlike Linkin Park). \\"What I've Done\\" is the second 'least worst' song on the album and it sounds similar enough to old Linkin Park to justify it being the debut single. Unfortunately it is very deceiving as it sounds like nothing else on the record. \\"Hands Held High\\" is a song that had potential but it simply wasn't tapped into. I enjoy the music and Mike's rapping sounds good with it. The problem is in the chorus as it is extremely weak and only sung at the end of the song. \\"No More Sorrow\\" admittedly has a pretty cool intro to it. It starts out sounding almost like a bagpipe being played through a guitar amp. Then the marching drumbeat kicks in followed by a catchy but simple guitar riff. Once the singing starts though I lose interest due to the lyrics and vocal style. \\"Valentine's Day\\" is the next song which again should have been released by Jimmy Eat World, Anberlin, Mae or newer/crappier 30 Seconds To Mars. Next up we have \\"In Between\\". This is easily the most embarassing song that Linkin Park has ever put their name on. I was downright horrified when I read in the album booklet that the band considered this one of their favorites. If this is what the band considers \\"good\\" then they have proven that they are no longer capable of picking what songs should appear on an album and the record label better take over from here. \\"Boring\\" and \\"simple\\" doesn't even begin to describe this sad attempt. Then we have \\"In Pieces\\", yet another snoozer track which only picks up once the reggae sounding guitar kicks in. The album closes with a tiny pop with the song \\"The Little Things Give You Away\\". It is a decent song at best but hundreds of bands could have done this song better. Overall this album will leave you with the same confused, empty feeling of disbelief that you felt when you first heard ST. ANGER by Metallica. I am giving this album 2 stars for it's four good songs. However, while this album isn't quite the atrocity that Silverchair will be puking onto the modern rock fans in July with their shocking disaster YOUNG MODERN, it was still a steep downward departure from Linkin Park's older/far better music. For all of the disappointed Linkin Park fans who were excited to hear the Linkin Park sound but without the rapping, the best recommendation I have is to check out END OF SILENCE by Red. That is how this album should have sounded and Red did it correctly and now sound more like Linkin Park than Linkin Park does.

0380820498|5.0|<br />Peter Robinson grew up in Yorkshire, and is the author of a number of previous novels featuring Inspector Banks. He is the winner of numerous awards in the United States, Britain and Canada, and in 2002 he won the CWA Dagger in the Library. As I also come from Leeds the background to his stories is something that I have experienced first hand and because of this I have a special affection for his books. However they would be first class crime fiction wherever they were based. <br /> <br />Having said that I can understand to a degree why some readers may not like the books.  Banks is a character that has grown over several books and the author is very comfortable not only with the character of Banks, but all the other character too. To me this makes the stories flow because the author instinctively knows how his characters are going to react in certain situations. The books are produced as a series and it is nice if you can read them all in the order they were written, but this is by no means compulsory as each book stands alone. They are what I would call `light' reading. By that I mean that they flow and not that they are third rate in any sense, in fact quite the opposite. <br /> <br />This book centres around the abduction of a young girl from her mother by two people posing as social workers. It is the mother's fear of authority that to leads her to comply with their request to take the young girl away for tests. It is only when they fail to return the seven-year-old that the mother realises that she has made an awful mistake. For all those involved in the case it brings back dreadful memories of the Moors Murders. DCI Banks is also investigating a particularly gruesome murder at an abandoned mine and gradually the clues in the two cases begin to converge . . .
0743277708|3.0|Watership Down is a captivating tale about a group of rabbits that have to leave the warren they've known all their lives. When one of the rabbits, Fiver, has a vision they decide to leave the warren. They take a few members of their warren with them on their adventure. On their adventure they go through many obstacles, but telling stories help lift their spirits. The main characters in this story are Fiver, a rabbit who is always paranoid about what is going to happen next, and his brother Hazel who tries to follow Fiver's ideas. When they finally find a new warren they must learn how to find food and shelter. <br /> <br />I would recommend this book for 8th graders and above, who like fantasy. Watership Down is boring in the first few chapters, but if you keep reading it gets interesting
B00078JZ92|5.0|'The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society' find the Kinks musically and lyrically in fine form. Topically, it seems to draw and contrast the pastoral setting of the country as a placid anchor and a source for metaphors. Musically, it is diverse, but still relies on intricate guitar, the melodic pub tradition, and Victorian accents. 'Village Green' is mostly a quiet masterpiece with able social commentary and fine character portraitures. It is the third articulate masterpiece from the singer songwriting helm of Ray Davies. It also seems more modern than 'Something Else' and 'Face to Face' with its spare production.  <br /> <br />It is sometimes difficult to discern when he is straightforward here and when tongue-in-cheek, but there is certainly an affinity to the serene country with the title track, \\"Village Green,\\" and \\"Animal Farm\\". Certainly, the contrast presented is flattering when he injects tales involving the glamour of success in the city. His funny takes from show business, \\"Starstruck\\" and \\"All of My Friends Were There,\\" are enough evidence that he holds the rustic setting dear.  <br /> <br />Nevertheless, Davies is more than a nature lover. He uses the landscape and his characters often to describe alienation. He does this well on the riveting \\"Last of the Steam Powered Trains\\" and \\"Johnny Thunder\\". Then there is the brilliant and intricate masterpiece \\"Big Sky,\\" which has been called a communist anthem, but I vote for a more Dickens' interpretation against aloof aristocratic authority. The spirit of English poet Shelly is presented in this song, but it is a thoroughly Davies' original nonetheless. \\"Do You Remember, Walter?\\" is a fanciful and mesmerizing song that pensively speculates about people who are able to live happy, conventional lives. Then, there are beautiful songs that do connect to people and nature. \\"Sitting by the Riverside\\" is romantic in nature and courtship. The expansive \\"Animal Farm\\" should be the best piece of evidence forunveiling the serene beauty of nature.  <br /> <br />Conceptually, the album is very cohesive, even if he stretches to other stories and themes. \\"Phenomenal Cat\\" is a spare and beautiful song with an engaging story that should appeal to adults as well as children. Similarly, \\"Wicked Annabella\\" is an entertaining portrait of someone who truly lives up to the title. Other numbers are more playful, like \\"Picture Book,\\" which rips off any notions of sentimentality, as does the irreverent reprise, \\"People Take Pictures of Each Other\\". Also, \\"Monica\\" is an exotic and engaging portrait of a woman who is stuck up and may represent the aristocracy.  <br /> <br />'Village Green Preservation Society' is a beautiful Kink's masterpiece that is entertaining lyrically and mesmerizing musically. It remains a classic and is one of their best works ever.  <br />

0316666343|3.0|The author is excellent at descriptions and her writing style is good. She is also good at fillers in between dialogue. However the plot in this story is extremely weird. Susie Salmon is dead. She has been murdered but somehow using the body of Ruth, she returns to the living and has a love affair with Ray Singh, with whom she had shared a kiss before her untimely passing. The story climaxes when her sister decides to search the killer's house for clues, just as he is returning home. There is great tension building here, but then it all fizzles out. Several clues injected into the story lead to nowhere. Some information in the story seem pointless.Finally, in describing heaven as a place where a being craves to return to life, the author failed miserably in depicting MY heaven. Sorry.
B000000OAH|4.0|Jazz is the culmination of Queen's super 70s trip.  Extremely eclectic and manic - this album varies from hard rock (Let Me Entertain You) to sweet ballads (Jealousy) to pop rock (Fat Bottomed Girls) to arabic parodies (Mustafa) to top 40 material (Don't Stop Me Now).  Somehow, the band managed to cram and jam blend a library of musical genres (with the exception of country and classical) into this collection.  The result?  The album called Jazz which I guess sums up the free form exploratory nature of Queen's playful side.  Impossible to categorise and yet eminently listenable - Queen was only just getting started.  Some excellent songs here but the extremes as I read have been tough on some reviewers.  Add it to your collection anyways - and enjoy...
B000MQC9H4|3.0|For starters, I'm a guy. And I'm also conflicted. Because while the overall quality of The Holiday is so low, it's also quite enjoyable. <br /> <br />The movie boasts a stellar cast: Cameron Diaz, Jude Law, Kate Winslet, and Jack Black. One might think that it's worth seeing the movie just to see these people all on the screen together. And they wouldn't be completely wrong, either. However, though they are very close together on the cover, in reality, they are in completely different parts of the world; the respective couples, that is. <br /> <br />I personally much more enjoyed the Kate Winslet/Jack Black relationship. Though an odd pairing, they turned out to be perfect foils for each other. Kate Winslet even had a cute sub-plot with this old Jewish writer guy. I wasn't as big of a fan of the Cameron Diaz/Jude Law pairing. They never really lit up the screen in my opinion. And Cameron Diaz singing \\"Mr. Brightside\\" randomly during the movie was painful and unnessecary. I've never been a huge Cameron Diaz fan. <br /> <br />The premise is completely and utterly impossible and ludicrous. You will have to get past the silliness of it all to just enjoy the movie. Also, the movie is strictly a \\"chick flick\\", for lack of a better phrase. So don't get it expecting anything else. That being said, my girlfriend certainly enjoyed it, and I find that when women are around who absolutely LOVE a movie, it's infectious, even if the movie is sheer cheese. All in all, it's an alright Christmas movie, and I find that Christmas movies are always good to have around during the winter months.
B000EULJLU|4.0|I think songs like Vicarious, Jambi, and The Pot are great. I would rank them higher than any song on my favorite Tool album Lateralus. The vocals and muscianship are outatnding. This CD is filled with a handfull of good singles but doesn't have the flow of Lateralus. It succeeds in its own right, but I would put it below Lateralus on its structure as an album.  If your looking for rocking tunes this CD is excellent, but if you want more of a deep dark Tool journey Lateralus will do the job.

0312360266|5.0|Zoey Redbird's world is very much like our own, except that vampyres have always existed. Zoey is sixteen-years-old and having a typical day in school when she notices a Tracker standing beside her locker. Never really believing the Tracker is hunting for her, Zoey is genuinely shocked when the Tracker Marked her a fledgling vampyre. This means a crescent moon scar appears on Zoey's forehead and she has less than a day to reach the House of Night, a private boarding school for fledgling vampyres. Zoey's mother is no help. Her step-father all but hates her. Zoey goes to her Cherokee grandmother for help, but gets hurt along the way. While unconscious, Zoey has a vision from Nyx, the Vampire Goddess, who informs Zoey that she is very special and has been chosen to be the eyes and ears of Nyx. When Zoey awakens, she is with her grandmother at the House of Night.  <br /> <br />Neferet is the High Priestess of the House of Night, as well as her new Mentor. Unlike before the vision, Zoey's crescent moon mark is now filled in. This is unheard of before going through The Change. Zoey soon learns that she has some amazing powers, yet no understanding of how to use them.  <br /> <br />Zoey is not the only fledgling in school with special powers. Aphrodite is the leader of the Dark Daughters. She is in training to be a High Priestess; and Zoey has made Aphrodite's black list without even trying. Zoey must look deep within herself for the courage she needs to fulfill her destiny - with a little help from her new vampyre friends.  <br /> <br />***** A solid foundation for a new supernatural series! It seems to target older teens, but adults will find themselves drawn to it as well. It looks as though the writing talent is a gene that runs strong in the Cast family tree. Terrific plot with well formed characters. I look forward to the next release of the Cast Duo. *****  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.
B000P2A256|5.0|I have been waiting for a new maroon 5 album for awhile, but this was worth the wait! Love it.
B000002BVN|5.0|A cracking album that shot straight to No 1 in the UK and  bursts with Michael's anger and vitriol. His voice is just amazing. Check out Ghosts/Is it Scary, This Time Around and the remixed Scream and see what I mean. Powerful stuff that's also incredibly energising. While I was formerly not a big fan of dance music the reworked tracks are treated in such a brilliant way that I am coverted.Pulsating. Recommended.  <br />
B000NVIXFK|3.0|Personally, I liked the direction of Vapor Trails and Test for Echo where Rush was getting their second wind as a premier heavy metal band again.<br /><br />This cd is amazingly middle of the road with very calm straightforward pop songs. Neil peart plays the most 2/4 beats I've ever heard him play. Not very musically challenging or lyrically amazing I guess I'd have to recommend it for die hard fans only. When I think \\"rush\\" this is not the album I'd want to put on to impress people who haven't heard the band in a while. This is more like the Rush cd you'd put in when your girlfriend is in the car hoping to find some kind of middle ground.
0684857219|5.0|This book is written by a MD and the ICON himself. This book is really a heavy and big book. You could probably build muscle mass by lifting this book. This book goes into everything from the history of bodybuilding, training principles, training styles, exercises for every muscle there is on the body. Pictures of all the great body builders from past to present, and a lot of pictures of Arnold himself. If there is something to do with body building this book has it. Also it goes into body types, what to eat, vitaims, and also steriods. This is really a great book if you are going to train as a body builder or a weekend warrior.. <br />
B000NOPA44|5.0|Mort is apprenticed to Death at a job fair, because frankly he's so klutzy no one else wants him, not even his farmer father.<br /><br />Now Death has a voice like \\"lead slabs dropped on granite\\" and He strides toward Mort, \\"black cloak billowing and feet making little clicking sounds on the cobbles.\\"<br /><br />Unfortunately He spoils His entrance by slipping on a patch of ice, and collapsing at His would-be apprentice's feet.<br /><br />For some reason, Mort is not afraid of Death.  He thinks He's weird and fascinating.  Plus his father has told him that some hard-working apprentices inherit their master's business.  Ummm...<br /><br />Maybe not if your Master is immortal.<br /><br />Mort is soon sent out on his own to 'release' dying souls from their bodies, and (this is the best part) he gets to ride Death's big white horse, Binky.  He gallops to his first location, a small cottage, and finds a bundle of hay by the door with an attached note:  \\"FOR THEE HORS.\\"<br /><br />Someone is expecting him.<br /><br />\\"Mort\\" is full of strange and hilarious encounters between the world's most naïve apprentice and his sometimes unwilling customers.  And just when he's beginning to get the swing of things, i.e. his sythe, he meets Princess Keli who is about to be assassinated in her own royal bedroom.<br /><br />Mort saves her life--a huge no-no on the list of things Death's apprentice should never do.  He and Princess Keli have got to work on her not-really-dead-but-not-really-alive predicament together, even if it means that Mort will have to fight a life-or-Death duel with his master.<br /><br />Luckily, Death's daughter, Ysabell (Disworld's first goth, although a bit chubby for the part) has taken a liking to Mort.  With Binky, Ysabell, and Albert (Death's valet) on his side, will Mort have a chance against the Destroyer of Worlds?<br /><br />WHAT DO YOU THINK? HA HA HA HA HA!
B0000C3I6U|5.0|I just saw this DVD twice this weekend. I saw pumping iron when I was little and remember clips but not much. I bought this video last week and I love it. All the extras were great. Interview with Arnold and his bio and the hours of footage that didn't make it into the movie. Questions that people have been asking for years about Arnold and that time frame were answered by arnold himself. The movie showed how they trained then. how the body building world was back then. Arnold in his prime and Lou Ferrigno in his younger days. They even had a reunion with some of the old bodybuilders from the movie which was great. I can't recommed this movie enough for all who are into body building. plus watching this movie gives me great motivation to keep going at it in the gym. While i know i will never get as big as this guys ( not like I want to.) but it still inspires me...  <br /> <br />

B000O174CM|4.0|I loved the movie Dreamgirls and am addicted to the soundtrack. I couldn't wait for the movie to be released on DVD.  All in all I was pleased with DVD. I'm a special features fanatic. I enjoyed the deleted and extended songs portion. It was obvious that behind the scenes portions and interviews were filmed during the filming and Beyonce was the star.  At times I felt the extra features were the Beyonce show. I would have enjoyed more on Jennifer Hudson.  Still two  thumbs up for this dreamgirl.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|Oh, Gilmore! *sigh* You were so young!<br /><br />Let's start this off with a statement: I am a GIGANTIC Gilmore fan. GIGANTIC! I've watched this show since I was 15 years old, so I feel as if I've grown up with it and its characters.<br /><br />This is the very first season. Rory is an innocent, inexperienced little one (yes, I'm getting sentimental even though Rory is a year or two older than I am). Lorelai is still working at the Independence Inn and, of course, looking for a man (which she does basically throughout the series. Luke forever! Okay. I'll stop, ha), dealing with her parents, and caring for the love of her life: Her daughter, Rory, whom she had at the age of 16, which created a myriad of problems between her and her parents, Emily and Richard Gilmore.<br /><br />The first season of the show revolves around Rory and Lorelai's relationship, their loves lives, and their outside school/working lives. Rory enrolls into Chilton, an esteemed prep school, and she meets a group of girls including the sarcastic Paris Gellar. Lorelai is working at her Inn with her best friend, Chef Sookie, and rude but funny as hell Michel. The show is also infused with the goings on of Stars Hollow (where Lorelai and Rory live), which happens to be a town I would die to live in with people I would die to call my friends. The townies are hilarious. Luke, who owns the local diner, is just beyond words awesome. And if you don't end up wanting Luke and Lorelai together by the first season...you are basically not good. Haha. Just playing. The show also has the Gilmore (aka: the rich world Lorelai left at 16) world alongside the Stars Hollow world. It is filled with Friday Night Dinners, fancy parties hosted by Emily, and enough guilt and resentment to make anyone become a coffee addict like Lorelai Gilmore.<br /><br />The writing is so great thanks to Amy Sherman-Palladino, Daniel Palladino, and other writers. The show has such heart, charm, and wit. The characters are the best I've ever seen on any television show. The performances are all great - especially Lauren Graham (Lorelai Gilmore) and Kelly Bishop's (Emily Gilmore). Scott Patterson (Luke Danes) is also great throughout the series, but never receives the credit he should. But do remember, I'm a GIGANTIC fan, so I could be bias.<br /><br />Basically...watch the damn show. If you don't like it, something is wrong with you. Just joking.the best I've ever seen on any television show. The performances are all great - especially Lauren Graham (Lorelai Gilmore) and Kelly Bishop's (Emily Gilmore).

0793563836|5.0|I use this book in conjunction with theory instruction from my teacher and it is working out well. The best part of the book is that it does not have TAB so you are forced to learn how to read music. The book can get boring, so you must stay disiplined and perhaps you could learn some cool bass riffs online to keep your interest.
B000P2A256|5.0|Wow.  I'd classify this as \\"alternative pop\\".  It has so many musical influences that it really can't be categorized or put neatly in a box, but like a lot of pop music, it carries melodies to the point you can't help but bop your head and sing along.  And yet it's much more in-depth than trendy pop - it has notable influences from the 70s, 80s, and some with a R&B flair to it. <br /> <br />Simply put - it's brilliant.  Yes, I own \\"Songs about Jane\\" and love about half of it.  Unlike a lot of reviews state her, this effort brings me round all the way to hug it, kiss it, and make it my very own.  It trumps \\"Songs about Jane\\" for me because the melody soars on each song above some really clever multi-genre, neatly produced music.  Every single track is excellent, which is rare these days. <br /> <br />Some of my favorite tracks are \\"Won't Go Home Without You\\", which has a contemporary and trendy Beach Boys sound to it.  \\"Makes Me Wonder\\" is a driving 70s feel dance epic, with a melody that's gets inside your head and throws a party.  The absolutely lovely ballad \\"Better That We Break\\" has a familiar, almost nostalgic sound to it that is reminiscent of the Beatles in places. And for some reason \\"If I Never See Your Face Again\\" brings Earth Wind and Fire to mind. <br /> <br />Frankly, I'm shocked Maroon 5 is put squarely in the Justin Timberlake box, when I find this far more inventive and impactful.  Justin has zero space on my shelf, but Maroon 5 is a definite stand out.  This is the best CD I've purchased in the last few years, and is one I will enjoy immensely for a long time to come.  I suspect it will be the release of the year, and will likely win every category it's nominated in. <br /> <br />Congrats to Maroon 5 for a sensational sophomore effort.
B000N4SHPS|5.0|Yes, Rocky can be cheesy, but it still retains its charm and ring of truth. Rocky Balboa, the sixth and last installment, is a fitting tribute to an American icon who symbolizes the personal struggles, failures and triumphs of the working class man. Sylvester Stallone does a great job in crystalizing all of the \\"Rocky values\\" in this final film: devotion to one's family and friends, standing up for your principles and never letting your talents and strengths go to waste. The hard-hitting speech Rocky gives to his bitter and jealous son is worth the watch alone; but you will also appreciate the engaging story line, nostalgic flashbacks and excellent supporting cast, including what might be a fetching new love interest for the Italian Stallion.
B000MCH5P4|3.0|This film, since it won some Academy Awards and getting positive fame around the globe, giving me great enthusiasm. However, the film was more than difficult, it was kind of boring. <br />I really liked the theme or shall I say concept of the film, but it is no denying that the film was advertised more like a exciting spectacular film. If the film were advertised more accordingly to the film I might not had this type of dissapointment. <br />Moreover, as a Japanese, I don't like how Japan was described in the film. There ain't no high school girls like Rinko in Japan! Their fascion was like that of more than 5 years ago! <br />Last but not least, I really liked the score of this film.
0596527055|5.0|'The Myths of Innovation' by Scott Berkun is the perfect book for a reader like me.  Tight, concise, interesting, written well, this is an absolute GEM for anyone that is interested how ideas come about and how success grows.  Coming in at under 200 pages, this book was edited superbly, removing the excess that most titles have on the bookshelves today, leaving only the tasty part behind.  With 10 chapters of goodness within, you will learn more about how ideas are formed, grow, and why leadership and direction is so important in not only coming up with the initial idea but how to grow it like a flower.<br /><br />***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED

B000K15VSA|4.0|I am also worried as to what has happened to the Definitive Cut.  I am one of the original Blade Runner fans, and just want a fine, remastered edition of it.  I want it so badly!  I have been talking to my 20 year-old son about it for years, as a fellow science fiction fan.  He keeps talking about the Fifth Element etc - which is but a shadow of Blade Runner in my opinion.  He has never seen Blade Runner, which is awful.  So please, just release the thing.  It is keeping us in agonies.  Put us out of our misery.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|It was obvious after \\"Chicago\\" and \\"Moulin Rouge\\" that the genre of movie musical was experiencing a renaissance of some kind. This paved the way for many projects to arrive from Broadway to the big screen, but there is always one significant problem - who is the target audience? More so, are the consumer generations of the 21st century ready to buy in to singing and dancing when telling a story? God forbid a movie doesn't have a plot or a point; it is automatically labeled with the words \\"tedious\\", \\"boring\\" and the pejorative \\"artistic\\".<br /><br />So, here comes \\"RENT\\". It is exactly a musical studios would be frightened to invest in. The very slim plot is simply an excuse to present a generation of artists, some of them gay, lesbian or transgendered, and their bohemian lifestyle. As they fight AIDS, hold protests and revolutionize against selling out, you are expected to believe that they simply often burst into song when you least expect it and don't give a damn that the things they talk about may be considered controversial, sinful or wrong (especially since they perform these songs boldly, unlike the very stylized approaches of \\"Moulin Rouge\\" or \\"Chicago\\"). I am glad to say that, despite all this, the movie miraculously works on its every level.<br /><br />The characters of \\"RENT\\" are based on real people and their experiences in the impoverished East Village, New York City.

B00000IMTF|5.0|Did I not yet review the ultimate example of late 70's speed metal?  Why not?  What's wrong with me?  I must have forgotten all about it.    Just about every song has an amazingly fast pace, and super exciting guitar playing.  Ritchie Blackmore is just amazing on this record and really shows us why he deserves to be remembered as the influential brilliant legend he is.    Not a single weak moment anywhere.  Radio stations are a fool for not playing this album.  That's all I have to say about that.   \\"Stargazer\\" is a hypnotic journey through the mind and \\"Light in the Black\\" will take you to any fast-moving place you want your mind to go.    Make sure THIS brilliant album is in your album collection, and shining every time you take it out of its case.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This DVD series is something everyone should have. <br /> <br />The content is very educational.  The colors are very vibrant and the sounds are incredible.   <br /> <br />You can watch these installments over and over and always see something different each time. <br /> <br />I recommend this product for anyone that has an HDTV set with viewing specs greater than 42\\"
B0000025P9|4.0|This is a good example of an album where the second side is better than the first.  Even though \\"Rosanna\\" is a great song, the rest of the music on side one sounds exactly the same.  The songwriting for each song on side one is so similar to each other, it's not even funny.  Of course, it's melodic and enjoyable, so I'm not really complaining. <br /> <br />Side two opens with a burning rubber guitar riff rocker, and following that is an almost Electric Light Orchesta-like pop song.  There's another song on the second side that sounds like something Stevie Wonder would do (\\"Waiting for Your Love\\") and of course, I don't even NEED to mention the song that closes the album.  It's the song that introduced me, and I'm sure thousands of other people, to the band (no, it wasn't \\"Hold the Line\\"- nice try, though!) <br /> <br />Well, side two is the clear winner for me.  How many times did a band save their better material for the second half of an album?  Doesn't happen often!
B000OVLBEO|1.0|Pure example of poor casting.  Cage has the same role/acting in every film, and this is no exception...yawn...
B000002OZY|5.0|The music of Tommy is where I first began really appreciating rock and roll, way back in 1988 when I was only 7 years old.  That was a very important day in the life of me.  There's no telling which direction my taste in music would have gone had I not heard some of the wonderful tunes from Tommy.  I fear it would have eventually gone towards Limp Bizkit and other similar unenjoyable bands. <br /> <br />The music on this album is simply incredible.  It's one thing to make a concept album and tell a good story.  It's another when you can take a story and wrap *extremely* memorable music around it, which is what Tommy does so well.   <br /> <br />I didn't really appreciate Keith Moon's drumming when I first heard this album, or Daltrey's emotional roller-coaster ride of a voice, going from convincingly angry to touching and sad.  He's very good at going back and forth between those two emotions.   <br /> <br />Still, I can't help but think back to my childhood.  The line \\"See me, feel me, touch me, heal me\\" has stuck with me all these years, and there's a feeling when I listen to how that melody is sung that strucks me on a personal note.  The \\"Right behind you, I see the millions\\" vocal line is another hook that has always stood up well, and will probably continue to do so. <br /> <br />I admit, Tommy is probably not my favorite Who album these days, because I've familiarized myself with other Who albums in the last decade.  Denying the influence this album had on me would be ignorant and wrong, because Tommy is where my rock and roll obsession took off.  The rest is history, my friend.
B00000FC5H|5.0|If you're an EWF devotee, you have to purchase this CD. It is fabulous! I'm buying a second one for my husband for father's day.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|should we continue to destroy our planet conscious and unconsciously? This DVD can be as a torch for kids or younger generation that we must and responsible to protect our precious planet. It needs hard work and collective effort. All beautiful things on earth not last forever. <br />I love this movie, I couldn't stop watching it............again and again. Highly recommended.......
0192834290|5.0|The book was in very good condition and arrived in a timely manner.
B000BUKHTS|5.0|Words can't express how much I love this book.  It is definitely a page turner.  I read this for the first time 7 years ago, and I can't even remember how many times more after that.  It is an easy read with a great story.  Whenever I travel anywhere, have to wait for a meeting, or just have some time to kill, \\"The Joy Luck\\" club is book I always grab.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I gave this DVD to my husband as a gift and he has done nothing but rave about how great it is.  The content of the series is very informative and the film is outrageous.  I would recommend this series to anyone who is interested in history, geography and nature.
B00005JKGK|5.0|\\"The Joy Luck Club\\" is one of my favorite books, so I wasn't sure how I would like the movie.  But, I was surprised to find that it is a great depiction of the book - very accurate, minus a few minor things here and there.  I highly recommend this movie, whether you have read the book or not.
B000J3EEBY|5.0|This was a very interesting and enjoyable CD. I have always enjoyed Celtic music but this CD shows the influences on the Celtic music from all over the world.  Ever since I found out Loreena was Enya's sister I have tried to find as much of her music as possilble.  Loreena has a voice as beautiful as her sister but with it's own quality.
0684853523|5.0|If you love reading his books! Can't get enough of his writing and want to learn how to write from the master himself, this book is for you. <br /> <br />It's down to earth, comes to the point and intertwines his own writing history and how \\"HE\\" does it from beginning to end.  <br /> <br />It's a must buy for any aspiring writer!
0156030306|5.0|I knew the story from watching the play my high school class put on many years ago, but reading it now was like having a piece of my mom's rhubarb pie and discovering it was even better than I remembered it.<br /><br />The story is told through the journals of Charlie, a mentally retarded man who undergoes surgery that makes him smart--a genius even. A mouse, Algernon, had the surgery before Charlie, and Charlie watches the behavior of the mouse to predict whether his surgery will be a permanent success or an ultimate demise--and a bond is formed between the two.<br /><br />What is fascinating about this story is how Charlie handles the changes in his life emotionally and relationally. I felt both compassion and frustration for Charlie while also, almost unknowingly, increasing my compassion for humanity in general, specifically for those I might consider less than dignified.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|If Rochester rang your chimes when you read Jane Eyre for the first time, this version with Toby Stephens should bring back that old feeling.  Nobody does it better IMO, and judging from the new fans it has spawned, I do not think I'm alone!  Have and am still ordering every work of his I can lay hands on...I bet you will, too!  (And Ruth Wilson the perfect Jane just for a bonus!)
B000O174CM|5.0|I never saw the movie on the big screen.  This was truly my loss.  From the opening moments to the closing credits, this was a stellar movie and Jennifer Hudson deserved all the accolades she got and then some!
B000P0J02E|5.0|To begin, I want to give a little background. I loved, and still do love, the first \\"Pirates\\" score. Yes, I know it was a bunch of electronics. Yes, I know that the CD had less than 50 minutes of music on it. But, you know what? It was really, really fun! The themes were awesome! You can't beat \\"The Medallion Calls\\". Definitely one of my favorite piece of music of all time. As far as Dead Man's Chest goes, I used to love it (especially track 2, \\"The Kraken\\"). But as time went on, I slowly started to like it less and less, until finally I couldn't stand it. <br /> <br />(If you want to skip my boring story, skip this paragraph) <br /> <br />So, about a week ago, I finally heard the clips to this soundtrack. I was flipping out. It was like, wow. Then I must have heard them over about fifteen times each (I'm serious). And I waited, and waited, and waited, for that number 22. I called up Wal-mart, and that crap store told me that they have Dead Man's Chest and Curse of the Black Pearl, but no At World's End. Possibly the most popular score right now, and they didn't take the time to get it immediately? Pathetic. Anyway, I bought it off of Amazon on Tuesday, and got it on Wednesday. How did I get it so fast? Well, I started the \\"Amazon Prime\\" trial, chose one day shipping (an extra four bucks), and waited almost all day on Wednesday for the UPS truck to come. <br /> <br />So, what do I think of this score?  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />-On it's Own:  Incredible  <br /> <br />-Compared to Curse of the Black Pearl:  This is probably better, but I love the first one as well. They sound completely different, so you can't really compare them.  <br /> <br />-Compared to Dead Man's Chest:  At World's End is plain out better, better, and better. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />I am seriously going crazy over this score. Dead Man's Chest, though not ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE, pales in comparison to this. Just pales. It seems like Zimmer used the electronics very lightly on this one, as the only track with them really pronounced is \\"Parlay\\". <br /> <br />Compared to Dead Man's Chest, the original themes aren't constantly present. This is actually a good thing, as we don't hear the same thing over and over again. However, when I do hear them once in a while, it's great. The themes for Davy Jones and Jack Sparrow are present as well, though not overwhelmingly. <br /> <br />It is so hard to pick the tracks that I liked most. Overall, \\"At Wit's End\\" and \\"I Don't Think Now is the Best Time\\" may be the best. But I also LOVE \\"Singapore,\\" \\"Up is Down,\\" \\"I See Dead People in Boats,\\" \\"What Shall We Die For,\\" \\"One Day,\\" and \\"Drink Up Me Hearties.\\" \\"Hoist the Colors\\" is great, too. True pirate music for once. In short, the ones I liked the least are \\"Multiple Jacks,\\" \\"The Brethren Court,\\" \\"Parlay,\\" and \\"Calypso.\\" I'm not going to go into great detail of all the tracks; if you want that, go to soundtracks.com and read their intensely long review. <br /> <br />Who is this score for? Those who liked the heavy use of electronics in COTBP may not like this one, for the simple reason that it is much more instrumental. But if you can get away from the rock-type sounds, then this is amazing. Those who didn't like DMC (for reasons I can understand), and have been waiting impatiently for this one to come out, then you WON'T be disappointed. And for those of you who have neither COTBP or DMC, give it a shot (no, don't shoot it).
B000MGUZMU|5.0|Funeral was an excellent album so it took me a while to get into Neon Bible and really appreciate it. This album is just as good as the Funeral but for different reasons. The band has progressed it's sound and taken a positive step forward (not sticking to same formula). <br /> <br />The biggest difference bwtn both albums was the drums. The drums are hard, loud, intricate on the Funeral. On Neon Bible, they seem to be more in the background (maybe bc of the mixing) and seem to be more complementary rather than driving the songs' direction. Now it's the strings, brass, keys, guitars, singing that seem to guide the songs and take over the drums. <br /> <br />That said, this album is great. It took a few listens to appreciate it but this one is up there with Funeral.
B000H305U0|5.0|Of all the cd's I NEVER thought I'd be listening to, this would be one of them... but after hearing it at a friend's house, I just had to have it. I'd heard some of JT's stuff on the radio, seen him perform a bit on tv, and have to admit, I was impressed. But this cd is something else. The boy-band \\"boy\\" is no longer. He deserves serious respect as a damned good musician w/ one hell of a sense for what people want and how to give it to them. Kudos!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I cannot possibly describe how exceptional this series is.  People need to buy the series and view it for themselves.  INCREDIBLE! Well worth the money. I bought it for the Learning Libraries of my young grandchildren and Great Niece, as well as for us.
B000P2A256|5.0|I am no music expert, but I love their music..! This is the very first CD that I've ever pre-ordered.. and I just got it yesterday. Wow. you won't be disappointed.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This version of Planet Earth dazzles. Attenborough's narration is leaps above Discovery Channel's version with Weaver. The only gripe I have is the fact that the regular DVD version comes with bonus features and end credit footages. And it wouldn't have mattered if you went for the Blu-Ray version or the HD-DVD version; both are lacking the bonus features that the regular DVD version has. Why BBC felt to remove these highly sought add-ons is a great mystery. Still, repeated viewings just for the sheer landscapes and vistas is worth it. A bit confusing is the 1st episode which acts as a summary for the rest of it, because it culls footage from all the others. I wish they had maintained different footage instead just to appear unique and not a rehash of all the other episodes.
0440229081|5.0|I have read this book to 4th, 5th, and 6th graders. As the reviews from children indicate, this book might be best as a read-to for they miss the subtlety in language and image: exactly where the book shines. <br /> <br />Almond is a master at exploring teen angst, perhaps his background as a Special Needs teacher helped here. The protagonist is a bundle of angst and he has no clue of how to deal with it. Almond puts his characters into a twilight realm, a world of half-closed eyes. Is it fantasy or imagination? Real or not? It is there the characters wind their way to a resolution. <br /> <br />The language is beautiful. The prose reminds me of Ray Bradbury's but on a more visceral level--an emotionality that speaks of the rawness and magic of youth. <br /> <br />The story abounds with wonderful symbolism (chicks, birds, flying, grounded, etc.) and sharp characterizations (Doctor Death, Skellig himself--a discarded, disused, dusty person(?)who, when in the sunlight, is beautiful) that make this book a supreme read-to for a class or parent. It is a treasure chest layered with mystery, the pain of longing, and the beauty of hoping. Of course children would miss it all on their own. This is a book through which a child needs to be led, like Alice through Wonderland, and it's a great joy to do so. <br />
B000KCHZK6|5.0|She's done it again, but it took me a while to get into this album, but once I did, it plays constantly.
B000H5V8DG|5.0|by far the most spectacular packaging i've ever seen ! but the content blows all expectations. reading all the reviews i expected the last 3 seasons to be way worse then 1 and 2. although season 4 gets a bit confusing in terms of where the plot's leading(even if watched in correct order, as i did), i still think alias is the best thing to hit the small screen besides 24. after a quite weakt season 4, season 5 pulled it off to bring back the amazing feeling of the first three, despite the many new characters (of which i think the reneé rienne character is absolutely misplaced and unnecessary) the final season gets better with every episode and the finale is stunning and spectacular. season 2 is my personal favourite, but all the others are amazing as well.     i've had this box set shipped all the way to austria, and not a single disc was damaged ! two had minor scratches and one had a strange light spot but all were completely playable. i watched seasons 3-5 back to back in about 2 weeks and and i was completely blown away when i had to leave the stunning world of alias after these 2 weeks when i literally had nothing else in my mind than Sydney's adventures and how it is all going to end.     so my suggestion : BUY BUY BUY this complete collection, before they replace it with a normal standard compilation of 5 box sets.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|I was never a big fan of Edward Norton and then I was given this movie as a gift. Was I ever shocked how well he played this period piece. Makeup, scenes and locations were all perfect. Beautiful romantic story with twists and turns going around constantly to keep your interest. The music is haunting and I have found myself keeping this DVD running on the TV even when not in the room. I have watched it over and over. Many have compared this movie to The Prestige, which is impossible to do. As that movie was a same Period Piece but a Sci-Fi movie. The Illusionist, even though it was still about the world of illusion, are still totally different movies. I have watched The Illusionist over 30 times. Needs to be added into your DVD collection!
B00006RINF|5.0|Swaped is an amazing song and it really moved me. The only downside to the song was the male vocals; the guy doesnt really gel well with Cristina's vocals. The whole cd is really well done besides the male vocals, its almost like a piece of heaven for me.
B000066C1N|5.0|My 3 year old LOVES watching the movie, \\"Spirit\\" and with a soundtrack performed by Brian Adams -- is actually one kid's movie that I don't mind watching over and over and over.  We bought this soundtrack for him and he enjoys listening to it as much as he enjoys watching the movie -- and so do I!  Great songs!!
B000M4RG42|3.0|This movie is an awesome depiction of what our fathers went through in battle against the Japanese. It showed the camaraderie the soldiers felt with their fellow Americans, as well as the hardships they encountered. Well worth the price for a piece of American history. <br />
B000O599WG|4.0|I have the earlier DVD, but bought this one for the wonderful extras.  However, I like the print from the first DVD better.  I think it is a matter of taste, but I think this print is much darker than the first DVD.  Faces seem more red, less fleshtone.  I would simply exchange the older disc for the newer one, except that the newer, darker movie disc also has a very nice Commentary by John Carpenter and Richard Schickel. On the other hand, the documentary about Howard Hawks is worth the price of the 2-disc DVD itself.  Some great extras more than make up for a weaker copy of the film -- I guess I will keep both versions.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Band of Brothers is the best WWII movie I have ever seen. I enjoyed it even more than \\"Saving Private Ryan.\\" It had my complete attention and made you feel you knew the guys in battle. But most importantly, it made me appreciate even more the sacrifices our fathers made for this country.  <br />The WWII era Americans were truely the greatest generation. I don't know how many times I cried watching this epic. Awesome!
B000LE1GVW|5.0|I stumbled across Paolo Nutini's album, These Streets, after hearing \\"New Shoes\\" play on my sister's iPod at random. I enjoyed the song and sought the album out. I came to discover that These Streets is a uniquely diverse album offering a range of well written songs and melodies. This is one of the better albums I have heard in the past year or so. Paolo is a truly talented artist who knows what being soulful is really about. The songs vary in styles, but the underlying musicianship is the same throughout. Paolo's voice, the most captivating part of the mix, is natural and inviting. Anyone looking for some great music should look no further- Paolo Nutini has what you need.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I love the Planet Earth series. I had to buy to have at home for my child. This series is the original narrator which I enjoy more..I was not crazy about Weavers voice on Discovery Channel. All in all, very pleased with my purchase!
B000P2A256|2.0|2.5 (Man I wish Amazon.com would invest in decimals.) <br /> <br />When Maroon 5 hit the scene in 2002, heads turned and mothers were throwing babies from the bleachers as this Jazz/Funk/Rock band tore up the charts with \\"Songs about Jane\\" and it's first single, \\"Harder to Breathe.\\"  Now, in 2007, they've decided to expand themselves, and, in case you read to deeply into that statement, I'm using it as loosely as I can.   <br /> <br />It is, in all honesty, a typical sophomore effort.  You've got throwback tracks (Wake Up Call), you've got expansion tracks (If I Never See Your Face Again) , you've got influence tracks (Makes Me Wonder), and you've got covers (Kiwi), but, in the case of Maroon 5, what you don't have is mood.  Gone is the moody, catchy Maroon 5 we heard during \\"The Sun\\" or \\"Sunday Morning.\\"  Gone is the emergence and aggression that were \\"Harder to Breathe\\" and \\"Shiver\\".  What we are left with is Maroon 5 ala Disco-Pop.  Jazzy Pop worked with SAJ and, especially if you're a fan, a majority of the songs stuck with you because of distinction and precision.  \\"It Won't Be Soon Before Long\\" features the band WAY out on a limb, attempting something new, and coming up repetitive, entirely over-produced, and way too poppy for it's own good, lacking mood in place of sonic differentiality.  For example, it's hard to emote and relate to Levine's lyrics when the tempo is 135 bpm, and Outkast is wondering if they copyrighted \\"Hey Ya\\" or not.  It's a clash between emotive lyrics (sometimes humorous even) and up-tempo, disco-heavy, synth-laden noise as filler. <br /> <br />I'm not saying to avoid this record because it DOES have it's highlights (\\"Wake Up Call\\", \\"Better if we Break\\"), but DO NOT buy it expecting \\"Songs about Jane\\".  It IS artistic progression, and I applaud that on every level in every forum, but, in my opinion, it's certainly in a difficult direction, too north-east to south-westerly admire.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|This is worth owning. I seen it on Discovery HD and know I need to have it in my library. It makes most other nature files obsolete.
B000KGGB2A|5.0|All I cansayabout this album is that Take That has changed alot. It more mature and for all earlyer Take That- fans, this is not for you. But on my conpinion i think the earlyer Take That was a bit nerdie.
074356619X|5.0|I have quite enjoyed listening to The Secret on cd.  What a positive message!
0385333846|5.0|This book shows up on high school reading lists because of its deceptively simple language and (supposed) humor, but only on rereading many years later did I realize how multi-layered and complex the story is. Billy Pilgrim is a hapless American soldier in WWII, who becomes \\"unstuck\\" in time and experiences life as one never-ending seamless moment. He moves back and forth freely in time, from his childhood to WWII to marriage to death, but since all moments exist in all other moments, there's no cause for sorrow over a death or an injury, even one's own. Thus Vonnegut can juxtapose the tragedy of war with the inane suburban life Billy subsequently leads, or Billy's life on Trafalmadore. Trafalmadore?--the fourth dimension, where  Billy discovers another way to look at life. Vonnegut suggests that perhaps war happens precisely because we live in the moment--we fail to remember the past and ignore the future. <br /> <br />On another level, Vonnegut paints a raw and brutal picture of war--the dead and the unlikely survivors, the killing of 100,000 in a night of firebombing, Americans brutalizing other Americans, the execution of a soldier for stealing a teapot as Billy returns home with a diamond found in an old overcoat. Kilgore Trout, Billy's favorite author, a crazy science fiction writer, is the only one who tells the truth, that man creates his own downfall.  <br /> <br />I've barely scratched the surface of this painful, absurd, hopeful novel. I read it in high school, but I didn't have a clue. Try it again for yourself.
B00003CX5P|4.0|I have been an avid fan of Star Wars since 1977. I was[..]when I saw it and I was hooked ever since. The premieres of The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi were major events in my family's lives. Even after Jedi and into my teenage years, I still held on to my love of the Star Wars saga.    I just want to say that I am not the type of SW fan who buys everything with the words \\"Star Wars\\" on it. Besides the DVDs, soundtracks, and a handful of of books/novels, that's as far as my \\"collecting\\" goes.    When Episode One came out in '99, my friends and family EAGERLY awaited its release, but I did not camp out or spend hours (or weeks like some knuckleheads did) in line waiting to get tickets. I went the day it opened, got in line about 45 minutes before the starting time, got a great seat, and enjoyed experiencing what it was like to be a kid again.    I will never understand all of the bad reviews and negative opinions so many people had about this film. To me, it was everything a Star Wars film should be. It had thrilling special effects, tons of action, a great story, memorable characters, and it introduced me to worlds and places that I had never even dreamed of.    It was amazing to see the Jedi order in their heyday and to finally find out where Darth Vader came from and how the Old Republic began to crumble. This movie and its story are the stuff of legends.    The ONLY fault I can find in the film was that the dialogue was a bit flat and sometimes unconvincing. The original trilogy films were rife with memorable and quotable lines, but the prequel films seemed to be lacking in that department.    I know a lot of people will hate me for writing this, but the character of Jar Jar Binks was NOT THAT BAD! I chuckled a little bit at his antics and agree that he did get a little too much screen time, but all in all, I didn't find him to be anywhere near as annoying as most people have made him out to be.    The moment the words \\"A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...\\" appeared on the screen, tears began to form in my eyes. It made me remember how much fun Star Wars was and still is and made me feel like a kid again. How can a \\"bad\\" movie move a person like that?    The scene where Anakin says goodbye to his mother and follows Qui-Gon out of the city and the \\"Force Theme\\" plays, it makes me bawl like a baby every time. That scene is so touching and amazingly crafted.    I think a lot of \\"fans\\" went to see this film with preconceived notions of how it was going to be. The same thing can be said about the first Star Wars film in 1977. Everyone thought it was going to be a stupid sci-fi film that would quickly be forgotten, but it became an American icon.    If one watches this film objectively and places it in the proper context within its relation to all six films, you can gain a deeper appreciation for the Star Wars saga.    This is a VERY GOOD film. Each time you watch it, you can come away with something new that you never caught in your previous viewings.    Today is the 30th birthday of the original Star Wars film and thus, the birth of a timeless saga. It's hard to believe that so much time has passed since then, but thankfully, we have the DVDs available to help remind us of what it was like to be young again....
1400063515|3.0|This was the most eagerly awaited book this year for me. The US release was on 17th April and I managed to pre-order with a local bookstore (in India) and receive it on 20th April. <br /> <br />The book does not live up to the heightened expectations after \\"Fooled by Randomness\\".  The 1st few chapters give a background and the author's perception of the \\"Black Swan\\". For the rest of the book he keeps flogging a dead horse. Honest and crisp editing was what the book needed. <br /> <br />
B0000025AI|5.0|Johnny Winter rocks! He's got great chops and clean licks. He plays some mean slide on that resonator guitar too. He's an all around great musician, I recommend this CD to anyone who likes blues. You can tell he admires and listens to the old school guys, but he has his own thing too. It's also got some great guest appearances too!!! <br /> <br />GET IT NOW!!!
B000P0J02E|2.0|... if you have never listened to Debney, or Korngold, or Herrmann, or Williams. Everything in life is relative. Compared to the previous two installments, \\"At World's End\\" is a top-notch orchestral work. <br />Compared to other entries in the genre, or music written for a similar kind of film, this ship has no sails, its crew is starving to death, and the captain shoots leaks into its sides himself. <br /> <br />For those who already know my reviews for the other two Pirates scores this won't be surprising, but I don't really like this score. Which is a great improvement over Dead Man's Chest, though, which I genuinely hate. <br />I heard it the first time and found it okay. Then a second time, a third, a fourth time. And each time it got worse. <br />Zimmer's principal idea for \\"Hoist The Colours\\" is good, and it may be the only truly original track on the album. That and the World's End theme, which heavily reminds me of Titanic. The rest is typical Zimmer, which means it varies between \\"noise\\", \\"padding\\", \\"static\\", \\"loud\\", \\"extremely loud\\", and \\"one-more-minute-and-my-ears-bleed loud\\" - the Hans Zimmer equivalent of the traditional p-mp-mf-f-ff-fff.  <br /> <br />Established themes from Dead Man's Chest, \\"Jack Sparrow\\" and \\"Davy Jones\\", for better or worse, return here, and don't do much or go someplace new. The themes don't resolve, and quite understandably so, since they had neither much substance, nor any remarkable versatility from the get go. They are not strong enough to survive outside of Zimmer's comfortable approach to all of his scores. This approach of overly simplistic chord progressions and über-harmonic movements not only lack style and substance, it also proves that any children's song can sound heroic or dramatic with sufficiently bombastic orchestrations. <br />And this approach is applied to every theme, no matter how big or small. Only Zimmer can, or should I say dares, to take a relatively small idea of romance between two people and make itsound as important as a historic war. <br />Subtlety is still a word unknown to Zimmer. <br /> <br />And there's only so much bombast a score can hammer on your ears with, until you don't believe in the score's intelligence anymore. <br />Hans Zimmer himself calls this score flamboyant and \\"swashbuckling\\". But the music says something different. But Zimmer can't be flamboyant because he insists on his masculine style of overboarding and overbearing brass and percussion. The best he can do is achieve a sense of overly dramatic adventure. <br /> <br />I know people in the theatre are going to laugh long and hard when they see Will and Elizabeth marrying to the tones of Tara's Theme from Gone With The Wind. Is this a conscious decision from Zimmer? How can anyone write such music and not see the blatant similarity, not to say rip-off? <br />Then, Zimmer says he didn't want Singapore to sound too asian. I can't imagine music sounding more asian than \\"Singapore\\". Listen to Memoirs Of A Geisha and hear how delicate chinese music can be interwoven with our music styles. Some may say it's a wrong comparison, but these are the standards Hans Zimmer has to be measured by. And he's lightyears away from it, that's the cruel \\"truth\\" (in the vaguest meaning of the word). <br /> <br />What else? Music from Dead Man's Chest being recycled note for note and instrument for instrument in \\"I don't think now is the best time\\", choir pieces that sound like they've been edited into the film from The Da Vinci Code, cues like \\"Up Is Down\\" and \\"Multiple Jacks\\" that seem to more satisfy the desires of the composer than the needs of the film ... who knows? Maybe a couple of co-writers had the chance to go wild on one of these ...  <br />And it all suffers from the usual horn overkill. Zimmer says he doesn't use samples very often. Very well, as absurd as that subjectively sounds to me, so be it. He's interested in unusual recording techniques. Very well, so be it. But it doesn't matter whether the horns play in the back of the hall, in front, left, right, dead center, on a balcony or through a toilet bowl - as long as the notes that come out are still bad, as long as the orchestration is still dull, the score will be dull, too.  <br /> <br />I can't believe, and I mean this in the strongest possible meaning of this expression, that Hans Zimmer has been working on this score since last October. <br />It's maybe \\"as flamboyant as Hans Zimmer gets\\", but it's defintely not flamboyant in the traditional meaning of the word. To pompously announce \\"I can write swashbuckling music in my sleep, it's easy\\", and then come out with something like At World's End is not only insulting, it's an embarassment to the whole film score world.  <br />No wonder truly inventive film scores can't get a foot, or even the big toe, into mainstream, when Pirates Of The Caribbean is presented as the ultimate incarnation of swashbuckling music.  <br />And now the main argument of all PotC defenders, that the music is perfect because the movie doesn't want to be pure pirate films, doesn't count anymore, too. Because Hans Zimmer recently proclaimed it as \\"swashbuckling music\\" himself. <br />
B000AOJ9X0|3.0|This CD has a great band, great production and a star studded cast, that's all the things that probably make it sell, but make me not enjoy it. Buddy is great and his solos are great, but I like him best when I can close my eyes and I'm transported to a little smokey club somewhere and I'm just listening to that raw guitar, way out in front, just peelin' the paint off the walls. I guess this is an attempt to make some dough and sell some records to the pseudo blues fans, but I'd go for Stone Crazy, Blues Singer, and Sweet Tea, those all rock in their own rights.
B000EWD1KK|4.0|I have been in love with this film since I first saw it on TV when I was a child. It is one of those classic Hollywood comedies that just makes you happy. It's got so much going for it: the incomparable Danny Kaye, a hilarious premise involving dangerous jewel thieves, lovely Virginia Mayo, wonderful fantasy/daydream sequences, and the sinister Boris Karloff.<br /><br />Danny Kaye is completely in his element here, playing a nervous wimp who escapes his dull life (controlling mother, and tedious job at the paperback publishing company) through daydreams of romance and adventure.<br /><br />Until I saw this movie I had no idea how very gifted Kaye was. He can make a reaction to toast popping up seem hysterically funny. His timing and acting are brilliant, and his physical comedy is formidable.<br /><br />I just wish that he had made more comedy films in the 40's and 50's. But I suppose it's better to have done a few brilliant gems than a whole bunch of decent movies.<br /><br />I also recommend his films \\"Wonder Man\\", \\"The Court Jester\\", \\"The Inspector General\\", and also \\"Knock on Wood\\" (that last one is basically impossible to find anymore, so I wish they'd do a box set of his dvd movies!)...
B000002I7H|5.0|Listen to this and you can hear a lot of where SRV got his style. It's no secret and he's the one who directed me to listen to Albert in an interview I saw with him. Albert wears it out, flying V upside, bendin' the crap out of those strings. He's got chops, feel and soul, not a bad singer either. I wish this CD had his version of \\"Stormy Monday,\\" but it's a great CD anyway. Enjoy!

B00082IJ08|5.0|I am not going to post an elaborate review on this album considering 300+ people have already weighed in. With that said, this album is truly a top addition to any collection. Damon Albarn is a genius. He has fused together a talented group of people and done an exceptional job piecing together special guest performers. This album is truly an innovative art work, piecing together electronic, pop, some rock and alternative, and hip-hop. In addition, there is tons of extras that go along with this album - which further develops the world's first and most successful digital group. What a story. <br /> <br />From this album alone I have discovered many new artists and bands ... <br /> <br />- Del the Funkee Homosapien <br />- MF Doom <br />- Danger Mouse <br />- Blur <br />- The Good, The Bad & The Queen <br />- The Clash <br /> <br />and the list goes on and on .... <br /> <br />Oh yeah, every song on this album is 5 stars. <br /> <br />Rusty Rothwell <br />Louisville, KY
B0000009XP|5.0|I love Buddy Guy, his falsetto voice, his guitar tone, his mellow pickin', his frenzied shreddin', it's all here too! The songs are few, but long and let him stretch out and wear it out! This was his first solo endeavor and it's totally raw and rockin'! I listen to it everyday! Get all his stuff, it's eclectic from acoustic blues to psychedelic rock, he's the coolest!
0743277708|5.0|WATERSHIP DOWN is a remarkable tale about the subjects of Leadership and Home all set within the world of rabbits. This classic is about how to lead others (a subject familiar to all cultures making this a truly universal story) and, surprisingly, the leader is not the smartest, strongest, swiftest, biggest, or most likeable of the group, but a leader who knows how to unite others, value others' contributions, and make decisions.  <br /> <br />A great book that gets better and deeper every time I read it. One of my absolute favorites.
0393327345|5.0|I had already read several Palahnuik books before tackling this debut novel, and I have found his writing disturbing, fascinating, and full of macabre twists. This one is no exception. I am intrigued by the concept that one must hit bottom in order to succeed. I have found this to be true, but not in the way Tyler pursues this theory.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a really good book. The plot twist at the end was unexpected, but in looking back, I should have seen it coming. The book rushes to its conclusion, but it is satisfying in its speed. The concept of fight clubs proliferating across the country instigated by disturbed minds is quite something, even if, as the author notes in the afterward, fight clubs are not a new concept. Certainly the anarchy that results is new. I recommend this book for anyone who wants some thought with their horror.

1573223085|5.0|There is a great deal of information in this book that is well known.  One may sit and say to oneself, \\"Great, tell me something I don't know.\\"  However, when you take a step back and see how the author synthesized all the obvious information you will see how brilliant of an idea he has.  He has come up with 6 basic principles (design, story, play, symphony, empathy, meaning) that must be applied in order to get ahead in the business world, global or local. <br /> <br />It has been over a year since I read this book but I still use the principles today.  This book is for ANYONE in ANY occupation.  All you have to do is take his information and SYNTHESIZE it with your life/occupation.  And that is the point of this book.  Virtually all ideas are not \\"original.\\"  They are merely a synthesizing of past inventions.  So, look around you, use what is readily accessable and repackage it using the six principles. <br /> <br />I am a teacher, and I have synthesized and run through the checklist of the \\"Big Pink 6,\\" as I call them, into substitute lesson plans, regular lessons, projects, and then even in family vacations, running our household, raising our children, exercising, etc., etc.
0618680004|4.0|Dawkins encourage athiests to stand up an be proud. For a long time now athiests have been told to respect other people's religious beliefs and this is really hard when we know they are a delusion.<br /><br />Dawkins provides a good argument for athiests against god as the creator of life - the probability of things being as the are are so unlikely there could not have been creator and it is far more likely we ended up where we are through natural selection. Take for example the fact that there are 250,000 types of beetle on Earth. Is it likely a god would have created all these variations of beetle or that the variation is caused by natural selection over hundreds of millions of years?<br /><br />The other classic argument, of course, is the \\"Problem of Evil\\" - if there is a god why does he allow so much \\"human-made evil\\" - war, terrorism, massacres, sexual abuse, violence, etc - and \\"natural evil\\" - cancer, earthquakes, tidal waves, etc. Once again you can use the probablity argument - does god make/allow this evil to happen (he must have a very sick mind!) or is it more likely that there is no god and these things just happen?<br /><br />\\"The God Delusion\\" is a highly readable book from this most well-known of athiests. Sadly as other reviewers have pointed out he is largely preaching to the converted, and will not change many religious minds.
0743496728|4.0|I'm a HUGE Jodi Picoult fan and I enjoyed this book, but I don't think it was her best.  It had some really good parts, but I didn't feel that it had the MUST SIT DOWN AND READ THIS WHOLE BOOK RIGHT NOW, the way so many of her other books are.  If Picoult is a new author to you, I highly recommend The Pact and My Sister's Keeper - both wonderfully written and fast reads.

B000P2A256|3.0|Maroon 5 has two gears: funk and ballad-driven pop/rock.  Most of their songs are one or the other, and some are a mix between the two.  This album is predictably not as good as Songs About Jane, but it still has a few pretty good songs with a few average tunes.   <br /> <br />The first two tracks show off the band's retro style that makes them distinctive in today's Top 40.  \\"Makes Me Wonder\\" is a foot-stomper and a decent choice as the first single, even though it likely isn't the best song off the album.  \\"Little of Your Time\\" veers too close to the generic dance-pop that is a dime-a-dozen these days.  \\"Wake Up Call\\" resembles Rob Thomas' solo sound, but it doesn't really stand out. <br /> <br />The next couple of songs are the strongest.  The band switches gears with the straightforward pop/rock catchiness of \\"Won't Go Home Without You.\\" The chorus in \\"Nothing Lasts Forever\\" will sound familiar because it is the same one that was used in Kanye West's \\"Heard `Em Say.\\" This bittersweet song is the best of the album and likely a hit in the future. <br /> <br />\\"Goodnight, Goodnight\\" is a ballad but falls short and turns out a little bland.  \\"Not Falling Apart\\" sounds familiar but it has a nice driving chorus.  \\"Kiwi\\" just sounds like filler material.   <br /> <br />\\"Better That We Break\\" is a good piano-driven ballad, as is the bluesy \\"Back At Your Door,\\" which ends the album.  All in all, about half of the album is worth multiple listens, but there are a few filler tracks that keep this from being a great album.
0385611463|5.0|This book is one of the most moving books I've read in a long time. From the first page to the last I was engrossed in the lives of each character. This is a book that will make you laugh and cry. This is one of my top ten favorite books of all time.

1905236379|5.0|This is one of our favorites at our house, and we seem to have just about every sing-a-long book out there!  My 15 mo. old son thinks this book is the best....he loves the vehicles, and I like that it teaches colors, too.  The art is kind of folky...very unique, colorful, and complex without being difficult to understand.  Each page is a different vehicle, seen from the perspective of a yellow car traveling home from Grandpa's house (\\"The green digger scoops up the icky sticky sand, the icky sticky sand, the icky sticky sand.  The green digger scoops up the icky sticky sand on the journey home from Grandpa's\\")  At the end you can trace the whole journey and see all the vehicles and shops that you've passed.  A charming book--simple and fun.
B00004VWA2|5.0|There's nothing like a classic album and few would argue with Carole King's \\"Tapestry\\" album. \\"It's Too Late\\" wasn't the only major hit off this album. Aretha Franklin had her own hit with King's penned, \\"(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman\\". James Taylor hit gold with her, \\"You've Got A Friend\\". \\"Smackwater Jack\\" got a jazz infusion by \\"The Manhattan Transfer\\". In fact, \\"Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow\\" was covered by: Cher, The Bee Gees, Dusty Springfield, Dave Mason, The Four Seasons, Laura Branigan, Melanie, Neil Diamond, Linda Ronstadt, Roberta Flack, Joe Walsh and The Shirelles, to name just a few. Some would argue Carol's version is the definitive, but it's all in the ear. In SACD format, Carole sings in your living room, just as she still does with ongoing tours. This album is a must-have. This SACD is stereo only, despite the Multi-channel reference on the box.
0060989157|5.0|This was a really good book.  I am not a big Crew fan.  However, Motley Crew was big when I was a teenager in the 80's.  I saw the \\"Behind the Music\\" special on them and was intrigued.  Any group that is going to get together and write an autobiography should read this book first.  This, to me, is the epitome of how a band should write about their life.  This was definitely a group effort and every one in the band (and then some) had the opportunity to contribute.  The guys in this band lived the ultimate teenagers dream.  Sex, Drugs and Rock and Roll.  They lived the extreme.  I am surprised they are still alive.  I appreciate their openness and honesty.  Nikki did have a rough childhood and it still haunts him.  But I think he has come full circle and has quite simply, \\"grown up\\".  He seems to be the focal point of the group.  Very smart and very focused on the band.  Tommy, in my opinion, is still a kid.  I think prison helped him reflect on his life and make some positive changes though.  Vince will probably live with his demons for the rest of his life.  Can't say I blame him.  And Mick, the myserious one.  I think he says a lot keeping quiet.  I may not be a fan of their music, but I am definitely a fan of their celebrity.  Great work! Highly recommend.  You don't have to be a fan to enjoy this book!
0316113077|5.0|I LOVE this book!!!  Some of the cakes pictured in it are incredible to look at but a stretch for my limited artistic abilities....but most are totally doable, especially with the very specific instructions provided.  Details like when to use what kind of icing, when to use a dowel to support the cake structure, what to transport the cake in, etc, are really helpful.  So is the section on \\"techniques\\", which gives the foundations of decorating, before the book launches into the specific design ideas.  A great mix of different kinds of cakes, cookies, mini cakes, etc, also.   So far I've made two of the cake receipies and the cookies a few times: and people loved the flavors and textures too.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|To state the obvious, I am a huge LP fan and have been since their EP. <br /> <br />But aside from that, I'll get to Minutes to Midnight.  Listening to the CD for the first time, I was wondering what happened to the same music that I loved and enjoyed from them in their previous albums.  However, anyone that tells you that LP isn't a Rock band obviously hasn't listened to this album.   <br /> <br />The tracks, the majority of them have a simlar beat.  It tends to dry the listener quite a bit on that first listen, but lyrically and as musicians, the band has really grown.  Chester Bennington (lead singer of Linkin Park) has improved quite a bit from the previous albums.  He now can sing much lower, some of the tracks on this album prove it.  However, Mike Shinoda really doesn't seem to be a major part of this album.  The rapping that normally comes from him and his lyrics aren't really there, which is truly unfortunate.  But the other members of the band have grown.  On such tracks as In Pieces, the guitar playing is really unlike LP.  You will also notice a lot of clapping.  If you look into some of their interviews, you can find out the reasoning of this. <br /> <br />Like what was pointed out before, you really will hear a different side of LP musically.  Lyrically, they are still there.  But they just wanted something that the fans haven't heard before.  They wanted to test themselves.  And regardless, if you have listened to the previous albums, you know that this is a must buy. <br /> <br />If you don't like it the first time, listen to it again.  It will grow on you.
1582701709|4.0|This book has received a lot of media hype, mainly due to its stint on Oprah. So, of course, I was skeptical of its legitimacy. However, after reading The Secret, I found that much of it was sound advice. While I don't necessarily believe in the \\"vibration\\" of thoughts, the discussions about the power of positive thinking and changing negative thought patterns can only be used for ones benefit. \\"The way we think directly influences how we feel\\"  is not a new topic, but this book gives an interesting and refreshing elaboration on the concept. Some may argue that the philosophy behind the Secret is narcissistic and self-involved; I believe it is more about taking your life into your own hands, and not allowing dumb luck to influence your actions and thoughts. No matter, whether or not everyone agrees with the concepts and theories presented within the book, there is no harm in having a more positive and uplifting view of ourselves, and the world we live in. Personally, my life has changed for the better since reading this book. I read it often and find something new each time. It can be argued that my positive thoughts influenced my actions to be more positive, or that I simply ignore the negative and choose to focus on the good. Either way, we all want to be happier, and our paths to get there  will be diferent.
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|I love this movie. Watching the deleted footage is great. Was intrigued about the alternate ending. I am so glad they didn't use it.
B000NVIXFK|2.0|The last GREAT Rush album was \\"Hold Your Fire\\", and the two following it were ok.  The last 3, however, just don't hold up to the classic Rush of the past, and \\"Snakes And Arrows\\" is no exception. <br />The problems, as I see it, lies with the melding of the music and the lyrics/vocals.  It sounds too unnatural and forced, and not in sync with each other.   The best tracks here are the instrumentals, and I usually HATE instrumentals.  The vocal tracks are all very similar as they just prod along, with the occasional moment that something exciting might be happening to a song, but then quickly goes back to the sluggish, generic, almost monotone singing that seems secondary to the great music behind it just waiting to leap out.    Whatever Rush used to have, I don't think they are capable of finding it again, and that's too bad.  I'll keep buying, hoping, and savoring the 1 or 2 listenable songs on each future offering.

B000O75F7C|5.0|I'm not even sure how to say how great this album is. Everything is solid; the music, the lyrics, the production... everything is incredibly well done.
B000000WCX|4.0|While many might scoff at this album and its production, I happen to be smitten by \\"Earthling.\\" Maybe it's the insistence associated with the whole drum-and-bass thing, or perhaps it's the catchy nature of the tracks, but this album is by far one of my favourite late-period Bowie releases.  Unlike the bloated \\"1.Outside\\", this is a lean, mean and aggressive little album. Despite placing a now-exhausted techno approach at the forefront of the mix, \\"Earthling\\" succeeds showing us a re-invigorated Bowie. And while he's got the irksome noisenik Reeves Gabrels on guitar duty, the music is still surprisingly tasteful. Below are my impressions of the original release's 9 songs: <br /> <br />1. Little Wonder- Boy, what a way to kick off an album! Standard jungle clitter-clatter plus gee-tar noise, meshed with jazzy piano, makes for a great song. The lyrics are good fun and are eminently memorable. The midsection is a bit cluttered and pointless, but that's forgivable. \\"Little Wonder\\" is the first of many outstanding songs on the album, and it will likely become one of your favourite Bowie numbers. <br /> <br />2. Looking for Satellites- A goofy and ultimately pointless track.  The lyrics themselves bear little connection to anything. It's literally Bowie listing things in a chant-like sort of manner. This track is not as propulsive as its predecessor, and it feel like a tedious plodder in comparison. There are some goofy spacey sounds throughout, and there's that fabled Reeves Gabrels guitar solo that's ultimately does nothing. That should have been obvious, given that we're talking about Gabrels. Irritating,  and submerged in the mix. A waste of a track, as far as I can see. <br /> <br />3. The Letter (The Battle of Britain)- The album's tempo picks up on here, and the song itself keeps you hooked. Sparse guitar crunchiness adds to the drum and bass fun. Following the verses, the chorus finally strikes: \\"Don't you let my letter get you down!\\" followed by an echoey \\"Don't you, don't you, don't you\\".  Suddenly, all we hear is Bowie and some dentist drill ambiance. The track picks up slowly and is soon back on track. But we then get derailed by a random out-of-tune show tune piano. Gotta love that old tyme jazzy interlude. That stops and we get more techno blipping. Echoey vocals follow and the track kicks into high gear once more. A  rousing number that ends up being one of the album's many highlights. <br /> <br />4. Seven Years in Tibet- The album slows down again and we get some bizarre mix between slow jazz, looney toon animation and a dash of Reeves Gabrels feedback. Bowie's vocals begin softly, and then the LOUD dynamic kicks in. Good stuff. Unfortunately, the song rambles on for 6:21 and feels overlong. <br /> <br />5. Dead Man Walking- At first, this song didn't make that much of an impact on me. Upon further listening, I've noted that this song is more an upbeat techno song than a drum and bass track. The four on the floor beat keeps your head a-boppin', and the chorus will stay in your head. The sound effects are more prevalent than Gabrels noise, too. A nice and unexpected jazzy piano outro closes the song. Many I've spoken with hold this track in high regard, and I'm inclined to agree. <br /> <br />6. Telling Lies- The skittering beats are back, as is Reeves. The track is definitely on the moody side. Overall, the song itself is unremarkable: Bowie intoning \\"Teee-lling Liies\\" is the only thing that you might remember once the track is over.  <br /> <br />7. The Last Thing You Should Do- Nice intro on this: Beats, computerized blips and an ambient synth. The lyrics imply that laughing is the worst possible action. It's a pretty paranoid track, and despite the beauty of its construction, it's not memorable. Oh, and Reeves drops by to throw pointless white noise. <br /> <br />8. I'm Afraid of Americans- I'd heard the V1 Radio Edit on \\"Best of Bowie,\\" and a friend informed me that this version was different. My, how it is. Thedrums are more subdued, the blipping is more prominent and the infamous chorus sports a different instrumental crunch.  If you know the V1 Edit, try this one for size: The disparities between both versions will bring a smile to your face. <br /> <br />9. Law (Earthlings on Fire)- The song kicks off with a sample that says \\"I don't want knowledge: I want certainty!\\"  The beat kicks in, the best way I can describe it is \\"jungle\\" meets \\"space.\\" It's got a heck of a dark mood, but its in your face. Samples abound, as does repetitive intonations by Bowie. It's head-spinning and dynamic and shiver-inducing. A heck of a way to close the album! <br /> <br />This album is short and to the point. Few of the songs on here are throwaways and most will burrow themselves deep in your consciousness.  However, the heavy use of techno and drum-and-bass textures undermines the potency of many of the songs. Similarly, Reeves Gabrels presence hurts the album. As such, I'm giving this album 4.5 stars.  <br /> <br />It's not perfect, its not for everyone, but those who approach it with an open mind will instantly fall in love with the tunes and the dynamics of the album. <br />
B000AOEMXM|5.0|Of all the ST series, I'd rank this as one of the best. While the original ST (a/k/a the Kirk and Spock show) was groundbreaking in many ways, it was more \\"sociological\\" SF without enough science to satisfy techno-SF nerds like me (I'm a computer jock by trade, and old enough to have seen the original series when it was shown for the first time). I thought STNG was better, liked STDS9 best of all, and never really got much into ST Voyager... but THIS series is great. In ST Enterprise, there's no great all-encompassing Federation (at least not yet), and we Earth people are still looked upon as a bunch of neobarbs who somehow managed to stumble into space. <br /> <br />The series draws on the lore of four other series and a whole string of movies, but it also goes into a lot of little nooks and crannies that haven't been explored yet. Did you know, for example that humans smell bad to Vulcan? But of course, Vulcans discipline themselves to ignore such things -- and also use a chemical agent to block the smell if they have to be in the presence of humans for very long. <br /> <br />Oh, yeah... lots of tasty little details here that will titillate the True Trekkie. And of course, it answers the BIG question: was there really life before James T. Kirk? <br /> <br />I've gotten through the first couple of seasons so far, and my only regret is that the series didn't last more than four. Of course, I could be wrong and it could fumble and stumble in the third and fourth years... but I think that in the first couple seasons alone, I got my money's worth. <br /> <br />Besides... T'Pal has GOT to be the best-looking Vulcan you're ever going to see... <br />
1400079179|4.0|To be honest I avoided this book like the plague because I heard so much about it.  Having already read Foucaults Pendulum by Umberto Eco I knew that the DaVinci Code would be the \\"movie of the book\\" version of that brilliant Grail satire.<br /><br />So, I didn't read it when it came out.  I didn't see it when the movie came out, and all the hype died down.  Then I picked up the paperback for 1 Euro in the local church charity sale last week.<br /><br />What irony - the Catholic church is selling the DaVinci code.  I love it!<br /><br />So, I was flying to Rome for the Weekend and wanted a chewing gum book (i.e. Light reading that you can dip in and out of easily).  Rome - St Peters Basilica - Da Vinci, it was a match made in heaven.<br /><br />Honestly, I read most of the book in the airports on the way out and on the way home, and it was perfect fodder for the trip.  The book is what it is, a bit of fun.  A romp through grail fantasy at high speed with a cast of highly unbelievable characters.  There is the Harrison Ford/ Indiana Jones symbology professor, the sultry french female police cryptologist, the murderous albino monk, the crippled English nobleman grail fanatic (AKA Professor Jones senior in Indiana Jones and the last crusade) and the aggressive French bad cop who is quite like Carl Malden in the French Connection, don't you think!<br /><br />All in all it is quite a fun book.  It won't get me knocking on the floor beneath the obelisk at the gnomon in St Sulpice looking for the hollow tile, but it may encourage me to take a closer look at the pyramide inversee next time I visit the Louvre!

B00011F5DK|5.0|This game reminds me of Dominoes b/c all family members can play. It is different every time with good strategies to learn and implement. My son loves it. No difficult set up, or set up rules to remember. Just open the box, keep pieces corner to corner, and play. Great gift.
0385340540|1.0|It is rare that I read a book that I don't like.  This one was as dull and boring as any I can remember.  There is about as much drama and suspense in it as the average how-to book about software.  I kept thinking that it was just a slow starter, but after about page 200, it became clear that the book was a dud.  I usually read books from the library, but I was out of town and desperate, so insult was added to injury and I purchased this one.
B000P2A256|5.0|I sooo love this album. Seeing as I work at Target, after work on the 22nd I went and grabbed the deluxe copy! I was sooo excited. Yes it has been some years since Songs About Jane, but it was well worth the wait. I can't really express how much this album means to me. I can relate to just about all of the tracks. The songs are sooo straight to the point and you can understand every word, every pain, everything behind the words.<br /><br />The sound is still Maroon 5-ish, but they switched it up and made it better! They explored with different sounds and found something really great. Much of it you can tell had a lot of 80's and recent influence. Like Prince, Michael Jackson, the Police, Kanye West. They found a way to incorporate it into their sound without ripping off the originals.<br /><br />All the tracks are single worthy in my book, and I can wait to hear them live. I know it is gonna rock. This album has everything for everyone: Let's list them.<br /><br />Heartache<br />Anger<br />Love<br />Sadness<br />Pain<br />Sensation<br />Regret<br />Forgivness<br />Release<br /><br />and one song in particular, Wake Up Call, has a bit of humor in it. But that is from my perspective. But I'll let u buy the album and figure out which song goes where.<br /><br />To have sooo much wrapped into a 12 track album is beautiful!! Maroon 5 shows sooo much growth, even with the sad lost of former drummer, Ryan Dusick. Even with the lost they were still able to produce a great follow up album. Adam Levine has some of the best vocals and lyrics of his generation. Can't wait for his solo album, but until then...ROCK ON MAROON 5!!!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|As a Science instructor for 35 years, I have seen many, many films, VCR tapes, and DVD presentations on our planet.  This one, however, is without a doubt the best that has ever been produced.  It is the most complete documentary on the planet that I've seen.  Every science department should have the complete set in their library.  Most students and adults haven't a clue as to the complexities of this planet we call home.  It should be required viewing for every student.  Well worth the cost!
0143038419|5.0|Elizabeth Gilbert has written a charming book about her year of personal exploration. Initially,while reading the book, I was awed by her success at persuading publishers to pay her for a year in Italy, India, and Indonesia. (She had a very clever explanation as to a year in these three countries this makes perfect intellectual sense.) Then, I was awed by her way of describing her experiences - and her reactions to it - with such perfect candor and detail that it transporting. For example, anyone who has ever meditated (or tried to for more than 2 minutes) can relate to the conversation she describes in Chapter 64. I read the book over two days and now my husband is hooked on it. Eat, Pray, Love is a wonderful book and will be the perfect reading for someone going through a transition (college, divorce, job change, etc.)
B000000OTU|4.0|This is a good comp album of Aerosmith's stuff from the mid-80s thru early 90s.  It's the stuff people who were kids in the 80s will remember from the radio.  Very good album for that age group.  The stuff from the 70s isn't here.  If that's what you're looking for, you'll have to get a different disc.  This disc is good rock and roll.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|You will be amazed at the clarity of high def footage.  You won't BELIEVE some of the high def footage.  As my wife said \\"that's definitely CG.\\"  But no...it wasn't.  It was a flock of thousands of cranes migrating over the earth, shot by a special high def helicopter cam that just blows your mind.   <br /> <br />From mountains to monkeys...they crammed everything cool on our planet into this box set, all shot in situations and in ways you've never experienced before.  This is a must see.
B000P6R6X8|5.0|I've listened to Wilco's music forever. I've liked all the musical change ups but some albums took longer than others to become accustomed to. Same with this one. It took about a week. After the first day I would have given it 3.5 stars. One week later I believed it's their best album ever. <br />Great Songs, incredible lyrics (Just listen to them!). The DVD is terrific and helps give you a deeper understanding of songs. <br />Keep changing it up boys! How about a punk album next?
0385339682|2.0|Usually John Grisham's books are a pageturner. Unfourtantly, The Last Juror is not one of those. I'm not even sure what the title is refering to. The first half of the book starts out strong but the 2nd and 3rd parts are weak. Parts of the book talks about Danny Padgitt but once the trial ends, it seems like Grisham is just filling paper to get a full length novel. There are even parts of the book where it's just gibberish. In fact, some things don't belong here.<br /><br />  Last time Grisham visited Ford County was in the book A Time to Kill and that was 10 times better then The Last Juror as it had was filled with suspense and mystery but in The Last Juror, there's none of that.  I like Grisham's past books but this one falls flat throughout.
034544678X|5.0|I loved this book!  Patricia McConnell has written an easy to understand and entertaining book for dog lovers and those who seek to gain a better understanding of their canine companions.  Although I am not an evolutionist and disagree with Patricia on the origin of life and dogs, the rest of the information is sound and she presents it in a most entertaining way.  It should be required reading for all dog owners.

B000MR9D5E|4.0|I enjoyed the series on american TV and that pushed me to buy this one.  I have thoroughly enjoyed the British  release.  I like it better than the american one.  The major differences I noticed are: the male narrator (BBC)  versus the female (USA), the BBC has several more features, and the BBC costs less.
B000KWZ7VU|5.0|It is one thing to listen to the Beethoven Sonatas, another to experience Bqarenboim's recreation of this epic soundworld.  His interpretations transcend technique.  One sees the role of Beethoven in music history and the history of keyboard writing in a whole new way.
B000E41MS6|5.0|Never having been exposed to Doctor Who before I am just in awe of the fine writing and production values that this series brings. The acting of Christopher Eccleston is Emmy worthy.  These DVDs are a must for any fan of science fiction or any H.G. Wells afficionado.  Just brillant in all respects.
B0002WZTOI|4.0|this is a movie to leave feeling good, patriotic if you're an American, proud if you simply like the feeling of understanding a small portion of what it means to defend good. <br /> <br />Its irrational, illogical, and sometimes silly. <br /> <br />But it is exceptionally well shot, the characters although thinly developed are great to look at, the music is perfect for this venue, and as stated in the title, the first 3 or so minutes on the deck of the \\"Big E\\" (this was shot on the carrier Enterprise) are some of the best ever, matching emotion, cinematography, music, and story in a way that simply makes you want to watch the rest of it no matter what. <br /> <br />Get a soda or a beer, some popcorn, and prepare to smile.  Or maybe even cheer.
B00005NTN5|5.0|A great suspense movie with a lesbian main characters. This is not often seen in the many of the lesbian films. The roles are well portrayed by the actors and a great lesbian sex scene.
0345494768|5.0|Since George Lucas is repulsed at the idea of releasing the original films in an acceptable presentation (the half-hearted attempt last year was a disgrace)this new book will come as the second best thing you could ask for.  This book is presented with no connection whatsoever to any of the sequels or (ugh!) the lifeless prequals.  This is pure Star Wars as it happened in the mid 70's.  Never-before-seen photos are in abundance and will keep you from reading the book for a while.  The good news is that this book is a supurb read as well.  This does not have the usual Lucasfilm spin.  It really fullfills the void that we first generation fans have felt for some time.
1594489505|5.0|If you were mesmerized as I was with author Khaled Hosseini's first novel, [[ASIN:1594480001 The Kite Runner]], I can tell you confidently that it was no fluke. This time, instead of two boys from different ethnic groups, he focuses his meticulous storytelling skills on two Afghan women of different generations and contrasting experiences. In fact, the shift to a female perspective uncovers a deeper emotionalism in Hosseini's writing, even though there is apparently no personal basis for the women in the author's life. He interweaves the women's stories over several years and provides a personalized, often heartbreaking portrait of anarchy and oppression in Afghanistan during the last four decades. What continues to amaze me from the author's first book to this one is his ability to place us so dexterously in their daily world without alienating us with what would seem a culture far removed from our own sensibilities. However, he cuts through such preconceptions with powerfully drawn characters that tap into our own sense of vulnerability and tolerance.<br /><br />The older woman is Mariam, who is the illegitimate daughter of a local businessman and his housekeeper. In the western Afghan city of Herat, she lives in squalor on the outskirts until her father marries her off to Rasheed, who wants a subservient wife as tradition would dictate. Unable to conceive a child, Mariam becomes the subject of abuse, and Rasheed's wandering eye focuses on fourteen-year old Laila. Through their interdependent circumstances, Mariam and Laila form a bond that leads to unimaginable consequences. It is particularly in the final chapters that Hosseini crystallizes the ongoing brutality enforced by the Taliban in a way that extends far beyond the news stories and becomes decidedly human-sized. Although the author expresses forceful sentiments, the book does not come across as a political expos&eacute; but much more effectively as a vivid and empathetic portrayal of a culture in turmoil as seen through the eyes of the women who must survive it. Strongly recommended.een through the eyes of the women who must survive it. Strongly recommended.
B000654Z2I|5.0|Tago Mago (1971) is a fan favorite and with good reason; the album presents a nice mixture of groove-heavy and atmospheric experimental rock and more avant-garde pieces - this music eventually became known as \\"Krautrock\\".  As a fan of the European avant-garde, I especially like this album and really appreciate their willingness to \\"push the envelope\\".<br /><br />The lineup on Tago Mago included Damo Suzuki (vocals); Holger Czukay (bass guitar); Michael Karoli (electric guitar); Jaki Liebzeit (drums and percussion); Irmin Schmidt (keyboards).  These guys are very interesting musicians and do not approach their instruments in the usual way.  The rhythm section is especially impressive and they emphasize a \\"groove-based\\" approach.  Come to think of it, they are central to the Can sound.  Although I really enjoy Damo's vocal style, it is a bit unusual so I can't imagine that every person new to Can would warm to it immediately.<br /><br />The seven tracks on the album range in length from 4'08\\" to the lengthy 18'32 Halleluwah.  In general, there are some excellent and shorter psychedelic tracks with vocals (Paperhouse (7'29\\"), Mushroom (4'08\\"), and Oh Yeah (7'22); a classic and atmospheric Can \\"jam\\" (Halleluwah); and two freaky, somewhat astringent, avant-garde pieces where Damo screams at points including Aumgn (17'22\\") and Peking O (11'35\\").  The closing track Bring me Coffee or Tea (6'47\\") returns to the format of first part of the album and is a great psychedelic track.<br /><br />All in all this is a fantastic Can album that is very highly recommended along with Ege Bamyasi (1972); and my personal favorite, Future Days (1973).  One other album from the German experimental scene that is highly recommended includes Tanz der Lemminge (Amon Duul II, 1971).
B000A3XYZA|5.0|I'm not closely familiar with many operas, but I have watched this DVD many times. Its considerable length contains a great many exquisitely beautiful songs. Handel is such a melodic composer; every singer in this opera delivers (extremely well) several wonderful pieces. The set is good; I am truly impressed by the portrayals of Rodelinda, Grimaoldo, Bertarido, Garibaldo, Edwige...all of them! Congratiulations to all involved, past and present.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|Honestly, I've got to say that, for the most part, Linkin Park has taken a very risky path by changing and exploring the depths of, what can possibly be, one of the greatest albums of 2007. \\"Minutes to Midnight\\" is a new chapter in LP's odyssey, and I truly respect that. There has been quite a bit of debate on LP's change of sound and style, but one has to remember that they're growing up, and I'm glad for them. Chester and everyone in the band has a vision-one that will leave us singing their melodies forever!
B000JJSRNY|5.0|\\"The Berlin Concert\\" with Domingo, Netrebko and Villazon features singing in five languages - Italian, French, German, Spanish and English - and a nice mix of orchestral and vocal music.  The low point of this DVD is Domingo's appearance:  he looks like Sadam Hussein's twin brother.  The terrific high point is the set of individual and ensemble encores.  Here opera fans get to see a soprano steal the show from TWO tenors!  What's not to like about that?
B000FFJ85I|5.0|From the look of it, AFI has taken another wise step into making their major label sophomore release a sure success! Every song has a beat of its own and a meaning that transcends every corner of rock music! My favorite song in the albums is \\"The Missing Frame,\\" seconded by \\"Love like Winter.\\" Please take time to listen closely to this band and their great effort, wait, did I say effort? More like a masterpiece!

6305388458|5.0|The cast of The Life of Brian seemed to have as much fune making the movie as I did watching it. There is always a touch of the sacreligious in th e work of the Monty Python team and the Life of Brian can strik some people harshly. But as in most of their works the tewam seems to be having fun with a story that could have been.
B000002UAU|5.0|The Beatles' SGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND is a finely painted multi-colored musical canvas that came out in the summer of 1967.  The record further enhanced The Beatles sound and presence within rock and roll, and for the most part, musical history.  Pause for a moment and imagine listening to this album for the first time within the context of the time in which it was created.  There is no doubt that this was yet another leap that the band took forward to craft and reinvent their musical skills.  This is the Beatles and not the Wrecking Crew.<br /><br />All of the songs are melodic and poetic in nature.  With the enclosed lyrics and a little insight about how each song was derived, each composition conjures an array of colors and creations derived from their personal lives, a cereal box, a child's painting, a circus poster, and newspaper headlines.  Each song sounds like John, Paul, George, and Ringo were having a good time, and this can be heard with the title track, \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,\\" the reprise, \\"With a little help from my friends,\\" \\"Getting Better,\\" \\"Lovely Rita,\\" and \\"When I'm Sixty-Four.\\"  Always the contemplative member, George also adds a tinge of eastern sounds with \\"Within You, Without You.\\" However, the capstone song on the record is John's \\"A Day in a Life.\\"<br /><br />Whatever one may take out from listening to SGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND, one thing rings true, it was and still is an influential and inspirational album that is absolutely timeless.  So, the most effective way to hear the album is with the headphones, and for album art aficionados, the most effective way to look at the album is to own a vinyl copy as well.

B0002Y69NG|5.0|The trilogy is very good and Keanu Reeves is a good action actor in the trilogy.
B000IFQLSW|5.0|10 days out is excellent with several different old blues artists on the cd.  The dvd is a great bonus to see these artists perform.  Kenny Wayne Shepard is the best I have seen since his mentor, Stevie Ray Vaughn.  Highly recommended for the blues fans.
B000P2A256|5.0|I was concerned for a moment about Maroon 5 and the direction they would attempt to go in after their debut success with Songs About Jane.  However, after listening to the entire new cd, I was pleased with the sophomore effort.  The production is a lil overpolished, but I think thats the way they wanted it.  With musical influences like Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson, Prince and other R&B pop artists and Rock/pop bands...you can definitely feel the push to be more marketable to a more diverse audience to broaden their fan base with this album.  Its cool though.  These guys are definitely here to stay!!!  I love it!

2913903878|5.0|As a World War II reenactor, there have been plenty of times when I've wanted to double check the information on a particular item. I'd seen this book for sale at a couple of shows, but shied away from the price. Finding it at Amazon for much less sealed the deal. <br /> <br />Want to ID a division patch? Need to know where the \\"U.S.\\" pin belongs on the service coat? Found a old military wool overcoat in the closet and want to know more about it? These questions and much more can be answered with this fantastic book. It has helped me several times, both before and after a militaria purchase. Dress uniforms, cold weather gear, equipment, weapons... everything you'd expect and everything you wouldn't. Gear for chaplains, female personnel, signal corps, engineers. Want to know what a Medical Department food tray looked like? Snow shoes by the Mountain troops? How about a company field desk? Chemical Department gloves? Ever wonder about what kind of cigarettes were included with the rations? Wonder no more. Just about the only area the book doesn't cover is anything to do with the Army Air Forces, which is a pity.  <br /> <br />If I had known about the treasure trove of information that this book held within it's pages, I'd have scooped it up years ago. I anticipate using it for research for years to come.
0743289684|5.0|Ayaan Hirsi Ali is a woman of breath-taking bravery and intelligence. I live in Perth, Australia, the most isolated capital city in the world, and certainly a world away from Somalia. We have heard of the horrors of Darfur but seldomly the reasons behind this horrific tragedy. The clans control life in Somalia, just as the castes and the classes control life elsewhere. But in Somalia they are crazed on the drug qut and guns and religion and ignorance. Ayaan gives us an insight into Somali culture that we do not see in the politically-correct popular media.  <br /> <br />She tells it as it is with an honesty that took my breath away. She tells us of her circumcision at the hands of her grandmother (who used a scissors) when she was a child. She tells us of the beatings her mother dealt to her and her sister. Her sister's slide into madness and eventual death, most probably exacerbated by her appalling treatment as a muslim woman in a country where women are never allowed to grow into adults, where they never have an opinion. Suffering threats to her life she writes with a clarity and style that most native speakers of English would envy.  <br /> <br />Ayaan Hirsi Ali lets the cat out of the bag on Islam, and especially women's role, or lack thereof, in it. She does this, not to denigrate Islam, but with a genuine wish that it rewrite the offending passages in the Quran and move into the modern world. She is to be highly commended for this.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|I was flipping through some channels on TV and came across the live show of John Mayer's Continuum tour.  I have to say that I was immediately hooked on the album.  This guy has really stepped out of the \\"sounds like DMB guy\\" mold into a lyrical and musical style that is uniquely John Mayer.  I went out and bought the album the next day. <br />I was pleased to find that the tones and guitar parts on the album were very similar to what I heard on the concert the day before.  There are so many great sounding saturated tracks that I would've thought the entire album was tracked, mixed and mastered on tape if it wasn't for the liner pictures of the Pro Tools rig in the studio. -We sure have come a long way in digital recording.  The overall best quality of this album for the modern listener is the great tones of the tracks.  It has a tight 70s feel without the noise and problems of the era.  Steve Jordan Pino Palladino and the rest of the production team are gifted in the art of making great sounds.  <br />The next best part of this album is of course the songwriting and composition of John Mayer.  In \\"Waiting on the world to change\\" he bridges the gap between his old pop fan base and the new blues/general music loving one that he will inevitably have after Continuum.  The second track gets right into the new sound of JM with his finger plucked strat pushing the thickly saturated Two-Rock Amplifiers, and the dry tight drums and bass guitar tracks.  The 3rd song \\"Belief\\" carries on the listener to still another sonically different feel while maintaining the album's thematic integrity of deep and straight forward lyrics.  \\"Gravity\\" is a song that takes the listener back to a remnant of the soul and feel of a sad 60-70s blues song.Q-Where did this kid learn to play like this? A-Eric Clapton Time Pieces...??  \\"The heart of life\\" is Martin Guitars chance to justify their endorsement of JM on this album.  It has a great acoustic JM feel and upbeat lyrics.  \\"Vultures\\" is JM'sattempt at explaining what it is like to be chased by the paperatcy- and has the best the groove of the album.  \\"Stop this train\\" is lyrically the best song on the album and JM brings the heat on the acoustical parts like always.  \\"Slow dancing in a burning room\\" is the song that makes you say -\\"Wow I am glad I bought this album\\"  this guy has put together an album for the history books.  \\"Bold as love\\" is a Hendrix song that JM nails down with ease.  \\"Dreaming with a broken a heart\\" is a great story song and puts you in the moment of the agony of a broken heart.  \\"In repair\\" continues the Continuum of great songs on this soulful album. Did I mention that JM has great vocal chops also as well as being a master of guitar?  The album ends with a slightly humorous blues songs called \\"I'm gonna find another you\\".  The lyrics are a little stereotypical of a guy trying to write a blues song.  The music however is strong.  I guess we can let JM have a little fun after laboring over the 11 other great songs on the album. <br />Overall this album is a must have for great music lovers.
0736063684|5.0|Bought this book for my son and he used it to put together a training program.  It is very well written with plenty of illustrations and direct information.  Anyone can use this book to get incredible results exactly where they're needed.  Very specific information.  The results speak for themselves.
B00004YRQA|5.0|I bought this memory card for my PS2 a few weeks ago.  It's worked perfectly - saves all my games just fine.
B00008PC2O|4.0|T2 is by far the best out of the Terminator Trilogy. I recommend seeing T1, then T2 and then leaving T3 at the store.
B00005JPGO|2.0|In spite of fine performances, this film (like Last Samurai) is just too slick and leaves a bit of a bad taste in my mouth.  It's certainly compelling with good cinematography.  I admit to having some difficulty with DiCaprio--I can always see him acting.  Loved him in The Departed but here, as in The Aviator and Gangs of New York, I just couldn't get into his character and kept watching him perform.  The film also was just a bit too sensational.
B000M5AJQS|3.0|The Award for best movie 2007 went to Scorsese for The Departed .  Although I enjoyed some of the performances, lead by Leo...Jack...Marky Mark et cetera...., I felt the movie lacked that Scorsese flare that we are all so used to.<br /><br />Being from BOSTON myself, I'm quite aware of the Bulger case, and this is NOT it.  The DVD would have you think so, but The Departed is really based off of the 1st film in the trilogy, \\"Infernal Affairs.\\" This is why I am forced to give this Scorsese film a 3.
B000K7VHQ4|4.0|Although I prefered \\"The Prestige\\" (both came out around the same time), I must admit that this movie was well-acted and very romantic.  Simple story.  Boy meets girl. Boy is poor, girl is rich.  Romance is out of the question and the two are forcefully separated.  Boy grows up and meets grown up girl again and instantly the romance is rekindled. An evil prince stands in the way and an exciting plot ensues to free the girl.<br /><br />Two thumbs up.
B000J3EEBY|4.0|This is my first Loreena McKennitt album.  I am thoroughly enjoying the music; however, I wasn't expecting the middle-eastern influence.  The music still has a celtic sound to it, but not quite as much as I had hoped.  Her voice is as beautiful as I have ever heard, and the music is very moving and wonderful.  A great work.  The only reason for 4 versus 5 stars is that it wasn't exactly what I expected.  But hey, that's a sign of a good artist.
B000LC55F2|4.0|Although I wasn't completely satisfied by the ending (a bit too unbelievable, even for a thriller), I must say it was a good watch - very entertaining and edge-of-the-seat suspense.  Great acting all around and a good plot kept this movie going forward. <br /> <br />Truly magical!
032147404X|4.0|As with many of Scott Kelby's works, this book covers a lot of territory, with just enough depth to be effective. This is a great book to buy someone who has a new digital camera or who is dusting off an existing camera and wants to know the basics. Common mistakes to avoid, equipment and accessory advice, etc. This book can make any amateur a better photographer and a more prepared photographer, and it's a very quick read. Recommended.

B000MR9D5E|5.0|Watching the gorgeous wide shots of craggy mountain vistas and endless open plains, tundras, shallow seas, etc. as the epic orchestral music swells to triumphant crescendos, one cannot help but wonder if the filmmakers were watching a lot of Peter Jackson. I mean, a lot. Because what Jackson did to New Zealand, Planet Earth does to the whole world.<br /><br />My questions going in were:<br /><br />1. Will the epic feel and scope of this series diminish its value and relevance with fluff? Answer: No, it won't. If anything, it gives a broader understanding of how the earth system works and how climate, rainfall, sunlight, and geography literally create ecosystems. The result is an awe-inspiring, global understanding of our planet.<br /><br />2. Can the necessary transitions from shots of individual animals going about their daily activities--the stuff of most nature videos--work well on the same screen with the splendor of gargantuan wide shots... many from outer space? Answer: Yes. Quite well.<br /><br />3. Will the Planet Earth diaries (the last few minutes of each episode is devoted to telling the stories of how people filmed it) detract from the series by showing you what's going on behind the camera? Answer: No, quite the opposite. The diaries are not only fascinating as stories in their own right. They actually make the episodes better. Seeing the hardships (and incredible risks) the camerapeople had to go through to actually find animals and film them gives you a new sense of the length and breadth of our planet's terrain and the amazing ability life has to find a way to live on all of it. It also demonstrates that this is more than a nature series, this is an event, a moment in time, an effort to film as much of our earth as possible before much of disappears for good.<br /><br />4. How much better is David Attenborough than Sigourney Weaver at narration? Answer: Definitely better, though the scorn heaped upon Weaver is a bit unwarranted I feel.<br /><br />5. Is this really the best nature series ever done? Answer: In my opinion, yes./> <br />5. Is this really the best nature series ever done? Answer: In my opinion, yes.
B00005JPGO|4.0|Blood Diamond's is a wonderful movie about the ugly side of GREED and control over the supply & demand for Diamond's. I talked to one of the producer's of this film while in Cape Town & she told me the original story was <br />much more gory than the finished film.  I do not think I could have watched it then.  It is to be watched & you  <br />choose for yourself.
0385509456|5.0|Having worked with children with autism in the past, I am somewhat embarrassed that it took me so long to finally read this book.  As the title of my review would suggest, I have a very high opinion of the book.  Stearing far from a dry textbook description of autism, Mark Haddon captures the traits and idiosyncrasies of the disorder with remarkable accuracy.  Standing the tests of many related organizations and foundations for the disability, this book is a landmark publication. <br /> <br />Rather than recounting the plot which many others have done so well, I would like to note one of the lesser noted conflicts of the book.  While people with autism often have an understanding of their disability, it is often the public's lack of knowledge that further hinders the existence of the person with autism.  The public intolerence is well noted in this book. <br /> <br />I found it easy to appreciate the main character of the story as he reminds me of children that I have worked with in the past.  Perhaps this is why I was so easily drawn into this book.  This is a credit to the author.
0743298020|2.0|I read some very good reviews of this book, but unfortunately found it <br />quite a disappointment.  The story just seemed too contrived, and none <br />of the characters really interesting or likeable.  When I thought about  <br />putting the book down there were always little developments that would <br />pull me back in, and have me read a bit further.  However, in the end <br />the resolution is pretty lame.  Despite the fact that by the <br />end of the story the  author congratulates herself on neatly tying up <br />all the loose ends, there are still a number of glaring inconsitencies.   <br />Indeed, rereading Jane Eyre seems to be a far better option.
1591840562|4.0|Guy Kawasaki is a \\"tell it like it is\\" author, which is important when you're a new business looking for direction, funding or both. The \\"Anyone Starting Anything\\" part of the title is a little misleading however. This book is not about personal goals or projects or even inventing things necessarily. This book is about starting a business, or a new branch of business within an existing one. And about what it takes to get the funding and momentum you need to be successful.<br /><br />It's about putting aside the ridiculous corporate culture of \\"mission statements\\", vision statements, binders and all the rest. Guy Kawasaki helps you to think about the most important aspects of your business and your personal motivation for starting it. In short it's about why the world needs your product or service, why you need to sell it, and how to get there.<br /><br />Much of the content is focused on the mechanics (and pitfalls to avoid) of making formal pitches to venture capitalists, banks and the like. There is also some content dedicated to advertising, marketing and PR, and how *not* to do those things as well. If you're not smart about it, advertising and marketing your new business will financially sink you, with no real profit to show for it, so pay attention to the advice  given here!<br /><br />Overall I would've liked to see less content spent on presentations and pitching (though it's a very necessary thing), and a little more on developing a market strategy, target audiences, etc. Still a very worthwhile (and quick) read, however.
B000002UA0|5.0|When Pink Floyd first started, they were more in outer space than down to earth.  The year was 1967.  A cultural and social revolution was going on at this time.  This was the year everybody was wearing flowers in their hair, smoking pot, and spreading the gospel of peace and love in the midst of unrest and controversy.  The message was to make love and not war.  The idea was not to face reality but sort of drift off into a fantasy world where everybody loved each other and there was peace and harmony.  Drugs were often that escape from reality.  The musical movement that was rock 'n' roll also embraced this idea.  Legendary recordings such as Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band were also released that year.  British singers and bands were stealing away the popularity and influence that once belonged to American recording artists.  The psychedelic movement was in full bloom in places like San Francisco and London.  Pink Floyd was London's answer to the Age of Aquarius.  They released their debut album The Piper At The Gates Of Dawn.  Astronomy Domine took your mind on an interplanetary journey.  Interstellar Overdrive took you even farther out.  The mastermind behind all this was founding member Syd Barrett.  His role and influence in the band was monumental as he would provide the inspiration behind the band's later works such as Wish You Were Here.  For those who equate Pink Floyd with getting stoned, this is the album.  It has all the makings of taking your mind on a head trip.  After Barrett left due to his problems with LSD and David Gilmour took over, leadership began to slowly sway to the direction of Roger Waters who took your mind out of the clouds and back down to earth making you deal with the harsh realities of the human condition.  Though the band members did smoke some pot and did a little bit of LSD, they were never really drug-oriented.  They never were really serious about topics such as science fiction and the occult.  After the departure ofSyd Barrett, they pretty much abandoned their \\"space-rock\\" image.
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|Ray Charles by himself is genius, but to pair up with some of musics most distinguished artists and provide listeners with a variety of soulful and beautiful music is simply fantastic.  The opening track is a great start with Norah Jones.  Though I am not much of a country fan the Willie Nelson Duet gives me shivers from its great color and depth.  I love all of the tracks and often will grab my partner and dance to the tracks because it is so great! <br /> <br />This is actually my second time purchasing this CD because I had to give it to someone who I new would love the music.

0156027321|4.0|I had the pleasure of reading this book without knowing anything about it ahead of time - I didn't know who liked it or disliked it, or why, didn't know what it was about, and when I started reading it, had no idea where the story was going.  Thoroughly enjoyed it!  When I got to the end, I immediately turned back to the beginning and started reading it a second time.  I can't remember the last time I've been interested in or intrigued by a book enough to do that.  My best wish for you is that you find it before hearing too much about it.
B000LC55F2|5.0|A great movie.  My whole family enjoyed watching together - which is hard these days!  I won't reveal the storyline - you'll have to watch it for yourself.  Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman are both great in this movie as is Michael Caine.
B000AMWIVM|5.0|SAW is a true horror classic no doubt about it.  Damn he {or she} who remakes this film...EVER.  In the world of gore-porn and endless remakes or \\"re-imaginations\\", {I have to say this ~ Rob Zombie is pathetic for \\"re-imagining\\" Halloween...thanks for trashing it Rob} SAW stands alone as a film that is sick, very disturbing, scary, intense, frightful, mentally numbing, thrilling, avante garde, theatrical, spontaneous, evil, and macabre! This is a film where the villains recorded voice is as disturbing as his actions..and the villain is not even revealed until the last minute of the film...literally the final scene.  The film cannot be compared to Se7en because we see most of the torture in the film and the villain takes up more time giving his monologue than Jigsaw's \\"Most people are so ungrateful to be alive...but not you...not anymore.\\"    Two men wake up in a grimy abandoned bathroom chained and unable to escape.  We see a dead man laying in the middle of the floor.  His tape recorder reveals the two men are part of a deadly \\"game\\" in which only one of them will survive...if he can find the primal instinct..the \\"will\\" to survive.  As the film progresses we learn about \\"Jigsaw\\" who tortures his \\"test subjects\\" in order to make them appreciate their lives they have apparently abused.  Jigsaw's \\"test subjects\\" include: Jeff a man who attempted suicide but failed, Amanda the drug addict, Adam the voyeur photographer and loser, and Dr. Gordon a doctor who neglects his wife and daughter.  Jigsaw makes them realize their blessings in his tortuous devices where the subject must maime his/her self or another to escape.    The films gives us clues to the identity of Jigsaw, directing attention to the orderly called Mr. Hindel aka \\"Zepp\\"...or is the killer one of the men chained in the bathroom? Dr. Gordon? Adam? The film is a Hitchcockian mystery to figure out 'who is doing this...and why?' that draws you to an intense and disturbing {not to mention disgusting} climax thatwill leave you stunned.      I like the film because like Se7en there is a sick twisted pathos that is plain and painfully clear in our times:  \\"most people are so ungrateful to be alive....\\"    [[ASIN:1419654047 The Curse of Aleister Crowley: Descent into Lies and Madness]]

B000BYRCH4|2.0|A movie like Into the Blue is one of those kind of films where if you have doubts as to its merits and then watch it, well, it's your own fault. You notice the 2 leads on the cover, the setting, the plot and you just say to yourself \\"oh no, I might not like this right?\\" Well you'd be pretty right, depending on what you think you're getting into. You wanting to see an original script? Good acting? Well no but if you want to see beautiful cinematography and actors that look just as good well here you go. <br /> <br />Jared and Sam (Paul Walker and Jessica Alba) are a young couple living in the Bahamas. Jared was fired recently as a scuba dive guide while Sam works at a dolphin show as an announcer. One day, Jared's brother Bryce and his new girlfriend Amanda (Scott Caan and Ashley Scott) arrive and go on a scuba dive. They discover 2 things: a plane that crashed which carries a large supply of cocaine as well as artifacts underneath the sand. But of course they don't have the equipment to haul up what could be a sunken vessel so it becomes a question of ethics: get the cocaine and use the money to fund the vessel expedition or leave it alone. Well, there is also the business of a treasure hunter rival as well as the cocaine owner who wants it back and is willing to go far to get it back. <br /> <br />I'll get the positives out of the way because I'm gonna blast this film later. This is one attractive looking movie with the cinematography showing off the idyllic life that you can have in the Bahamas and the underwater photography was well-done as well. The other is of course seeing Alba and Scott in bikinis, which'll get the males salivating. In fact you can make a case this is really the only reason to watch. As for the ladies, well I'm sure Walker is bound to get them going nuts since he's shirtless for a huge chunk of the movie. <br /> <br />Everything else though is just awful. Granted, parts of the story were kind of surprising since half the time I didn't know where it was going but whether that was the script being ahead of me or it just didn't know what it was doing, I haven't a clue. Not to mention these characters are some of the most dumbest I've seen with so many bad choices and you wonder maybe they've been out in the sun too long. And while attractive, all 4 of the leads either look uninterested or they're just not bringing all their acting cards to the table, especially Walker who just feels so...bland. And what's with his Aquaman-like lung capacity? <br /> <br />Should you buy it? No, unless you're a Walker or Alba fan. Should you rent it? If you haven't found anything else, I suppose you can but don't say I didn't warn you.
B000002I6V|5.0|This album is truly astonishing for one reason and one reason only.  It is a quality of work that Graham Nash never equalled before or after this release. <br /> <br />This is one of the four solo albums produced by the individual parts of CSNY on the heels of the release of Deja Vu, and with the exception of Neil Young's spectacular After The Goldrush it might be the best of them. <br /> <br />Rich with CSNY harmonies and the clear backing vocals and instrumentals of Crosby, Young and Garcia this is a standout release that showed Nash could indeed make it on his own, with a little help from his friends. <br /> <br />What is amazing that he was never again able to harness this level of creativity or originality again in his solo work.  But this appears to be the hallmark of Nash.  He had other pursuits to follow, including art, photography and Joni Mitchell. <br /> <br />Buy this album for a glimpse at what could have been a truly remarkable songwriting career if he had been able to repeat the magic heard here.

B000MNP2KI|5.0|I never thought I'd ever like another Bond after Sean Connery but Daniel Craig does a great acting job in filling Bond's shoes after many actors who've tried over the last twenty years.  Craig's raw sexuality and great physical strength brings back the feeling of the original James Bond.  Long my he live!!!
B000MXPE88|4.0|You will be disappointed if you expect a typical Hollywood spy movie with explosions and car chases.  This portrait of real spies requires some intelligence and experience to enjoy.  Matt Damon is just the perfect guy to play Edward Wilson, a cold and calculating CIA spy who would sacrifice anything including his family to do his job.  The quiet, detached personality that makes him rather dull in the Bourne series works magic here.  I totally enjoyed this well-made film.
0380730367|5.0|There's a pattern to Lehane's books. Small story. HUGE, epic story. Small story. FRIGGIN' HUGE, epic story. And so on.<br /><br />He starts off with A DRINK BEFORE THE WAR, a nice, small, enjoyable set piece. Then comes DARKNESS, TAKE MY HAND, a 500-page epic. SACRED, his smallest story yet, comes and goes and isn't that memorable. GONE, BABY, GONE explodes onto the scene as his biggest story to date, also garnering the most rave reviews. A true masterpiece.<br /><br />With this kind of pattern, I was afraid his next title would be something like SACRED, or at best, small like DRINK, and I didn't want to wave goodbye to Patrick and Angie on that kind of note. So I slid my copy of PRAYERS FOR RAIN off my bookshelf and braced for the inevitable Lehane accordion.<br /><br />And to my surprise, Lehane broke the mold.<br /><br />PRAYERS FOR RAIN isn't on the same epic scale as DARKNESS or GONE by any means. But what Lehane did manage to do was carry over the fresh prose, the stark imagery, the cutting dialogue, and the compelling mystery of GONE with the small set structure of SACRED, fusing the best of both worlds in the process.<br /><br />The end result is a fascinating mystery centering around a smaller number of characters but written by one of the best stylists in the genre. Lehane hooked me and kept me reading straight through the end, and unlike SACRED where the villain wasn't that believable or threatening, the bad guy in PRAYERS is truly menacing. Every character in this book is a treat to watch, and every scene is gripping. Just like GONE, but on a smaller scale.<br /><br />If you liked A DRINK BEFORE THE WAR; DARKNESS, TAKE MY HAND; or GONE, BABY, GONE, check out this book. It shows that Lehane can do it all.

B00005MP58|5.0|This is a wonderful adaptation of Jane Austen's masterpiece!  Near perfection in every aspect of screenwriting, acting, costumes and cinematography.  I have both the SE DVD and the VHS tapes and I believe the convenience of the DVD far outweighs the problem of the slight difference in color between the two mediums.  I may have been lucky and got a good dvd because I have not experienced the washed out tones or dark contrasts.  In my dvd the words and lips do match up so I am inclined to think that different batches provided different results when dubbed.
B00005JPAO|5.0|Gives you a glimpse of what happened behind the scenes with the Royal Family after the death of Diana.  Not a flattering view but makes them seem more human with all their faults.  Wonderful acting by Helen Mirren who rightly deserved the Oscar for this role.
B000EBD9TY|5.0|Tennessee Williams rightfully takes his place as one of the premier playwrights in the history of the American theater. The relentless turning out of high quality pieces (and other short literary expositions) on subjects that in an earlier day before the 1950's would have not found nearly so receptive an audience. <br /> <br />I saw the movie version of Streetcar long before I read the original play so that, of necessity, the role of Stanley on the page evokes the powerfully strong, sexual and primitive role performed by Marlon Brando and the equally powerful performance by Vivian Leigh as the coquettish down on her heels Blanche Dubois. There are however, important differences between the story line presented in the movie and in the original play version. Some of the more explicit graphically sexual scenes and latent homosexual allusions did not pass muster with the censors of the times. For one familiar with the story from the stage or theater it is well worth going back and reading the original play to get a feel for the tensions that remain unexplored in the other media. <br /> <br />A reading of the play also makes clear something is missing from the productions and that is the sense that the characters are sleepwalking through life with their own private illusions that prevent them each, in the final analysis, from having more than a surface understanding of the others in the claustrophobic little home they inhabit. Blanche will pay, and pay dearly, for not understanding Stanley better as she tries to live the illusion of a fallen, aging Southern Belle. In any case, whether on stage on the screen or on the page this is a great American classic. <br />
B000NVIGC0|5.0|I know I have sung the praises of Wilco before.Their last three cd's have been most excellent.'Yankee Hotel Foxtrot' is a modern masterpiece.'A Ghost Is Born',though somewhat lesser of the two cd's is brave and goes beyond the grandness of Foxtrot.Their double live cd,'Kicking Television' puts out some of the definitive versions of some of there best songs. <br />And boy,does Wilco have great songs.I can not imagine how joyless my life would be without knowing such great songs such as,'Jesus,Etc';Christ For President';'I Am Trying To Break Your Heart';'I Must be High';'Ashes Of American Flags';'At Least That's what She Said';'Hell Is Chrome';'Kidsmoke';'Hummingbird';'Wishful Thinking' and many many more. <br />Now,comes their new cd,'Blue Sky Blue'.And,like most Wilco cd's,it is not totally like any other Wilco cd.'Blue Sky Blue' is what I would call Wilco's most commercial cd to date.And I mean that in a very good way.Throughout the cd they channel 'The Eagles','The Allman Brothers Band',Neil Young' and other 70's icons....while still keeping it 2007 fresh and a blazing new Wilco. <br />Jeff Tweety and company have done themselves proud.Just listening to songs like,'Impossible Germany';'Sky Blue Sky';'Please Be Patient With Me' and 'Hate It Here',make me want to have a record listening party. <br />However,like most of the freshest,newest sounding music,the full affect of this cd's greatness does not hit you until after your forth or so listening[some of you anti-SBS people should give this a try].Beware,you will be caught off guard catching yourself humming and singing these tunes if you give the cd the chance to grow on you.I know with the throw-a-way music that is out there now-a-days that is asking allot.But this Wilco cd stays with you just like the music did in the good ol'days.And that is high praise,indeed. <br />If there were any justice,Wilco would be king of the FM radio heap.This is what today's modern FM radio should should like. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
1594489505|5.0|Hosseini doesn't necessarily write happy endings, but A Thousand Splendid Suns is filled with HOPE.  This brilliant narrative is full of both sadness and wonder.<br /><br />Miriam and Laila are forced to adapt under the roof of their dominating and cruel husband.  As an American, I had to struggle with the unfairness of their lives as subservient women in an Islamic state.  But Hosseini does a wonderful job outlining the recent history of Afghanistan and the social upheaval that shapes the lives of the characters.  It was incredibly empowering to see these women rise from the ashes of oppression and the rubble of Kabul to make better lives for themselves at all costs.  I wanted to weep one moment, and rejoice the next.  When I finished the book, I felt the lingering presence of Miriam and Laila and knew that I would not soon forget them.
B0000AUHQT|4.0|This movie, unlike many others, was able to captivate the book to minute details. Although there were some differences, the main points were conveyed to the viewer. As I read the book along with the movie I saw that they were essentially one in the same. The director must have had the same passion for the book as the millions of readers who praise its pages. Simply by watching this movie, the viewer was able to walk away with the same knowledge gained in the book. This may not be said for a majority books made into movies. The landscape and location of the movie were hand-in-hand with how I pictured it to be. All in all, this movie struck gold with its overall portrayal of the book. <br />     Personally I did not think the characterization was amazing. I thought that Daisy, Gatsby, and Tom were portrayed just as I imagined. However, Nick was not portrayed as well as he could have been. Nick seemed to convey poorly. He was almost scared and shy. The Nick I imagined was much more opinionated and intelligent. Myrtle, to me, seemed to be too dirty and rugged. I know she was poor, but considering she was able to captivate Tom, I imagined a diamond in the rough. Gatsby acted just as I pictured, as a money obsessed fiend. Daisy was also portrayed as I imagine, as a materialistic bimbo. She cared about one person--herself. This truly was the great American novel. <br />

0316018953|5.0|Bosch, in his first fresh case after leaving the Open-Unsolved Unit, finds himself in the middle of a juggling act.  First, there's his pursuit of a greater danger than any murder case ever had, then the volleying with hot shot FBI agents bent on preserving their side of the net and, finally, what to do about the love feeling beating in his chest.<br /><br />Minimalist in his details and descriptions, Connelly sticks to what's relevant in a thread of reasoning and investigative urgency, which aids him in maintaining a crisp pace.  He has turned out a fascinating, swift read that pays off in suspense and twists.  Giving as much attention to the emotional evolution of his prime character as to the mechanics and revelation of his case, Connelly maintains Bosch as one of the more dimensional police investigators the genre has to offer.<br /><br />His management of the central romance held at bay is tantalizingly designed to keep our interest and the personal/professional potentials wide open.  Need I say that it all amounts to maintaining the author at his best-selling peak.
B00000AFGM|5.0|This is Marilyn Mansons sole masterpiece. Their other albums are good, but this one takes the cake. It's sad that this album will never be topped by them.<br /><br />The combination of John 5 and Jeordie White on this is brilliant. I don't even like Manson himself, I've always just loved the band, but I'll give him credit when its due. I highly recommend this album. My personal favorite is Disassociative. But The Speed of Pain is definately one of the most beautiful songs ever written and having gospel singers in it just makes it even better.
B00000IREA|3.0|I think \\"Barbarella\\" is best appreciated at a midnight showing with people shouting rude things at the screen.  The flick is undermined by the lunkheaded direction of Roger Vadim.  Did anybody explain to this guy that he was making camp?  Also on display is some of the most garish art direction ever.  Austin Powers would vomit.  I did dig the shag carpeting in Barb's spaceship, though.  What redeems this enterprise is the acting, not least Jane Fonda in the title role.  Jane, consummate actress that she is, did understand the tongue-in-cheek aspects of the film.  Jane's striptease over the opening credits is something to write home about.  Good contributions are also given by David Hemings, Milo O'Shea, Anita Pallenberg, and Ugo Tognazzi.  Venture into this flick for it's curiousity value and nothing else.

B000OCXMAE|5.0|I, too, call myself an avid fan of Linkin Park. I LOVED Hybrid Theory and Meteora and as such could not wait until their new album came out. I wanted more LP! So what did I do? I checked the internet often to see what the progress was on a new album and came upon some articles dating back to September of last year where both Mike Shinoda and Chester Bennington said, \\"The Nu-Metal sound will be COMPLETELY GONE from the upcoming album.\\" <br />  And yet I keep reading low reviews that say the same thing over and over--\\"I liked the album, but it wasnt Linkin Park...I like the combination of rock and rap.\\" You mean...the thing that the two frontmen said would be gone? Why didn't you guys save your time and money from buying the new album and just read the articles that are easily found by Googling \\"Linkin Park new album!?\\"  <br />  I didn't want a Hybrid Theory or Meteora, Part 2. I wanted a third album from talented musical artists, evolving in their craft--doing something new, tapping new areas of their talent and producing a lasting third installment of their genius. That's EXACTLY what I got. Yeah, I would have like one or two more rap songs from Shinoda, but what I heard was phenomenal. Then I got to hear the raspiness I like from Bennington and a more toned-down, different side of his raw intellectual emotion in his vocals (i.e. The Little Things..., Valentines Day, Shadow of the Day). I LOVE 'What I've Done' but like most first singles, it was merely a \\"taste\\" of what was to come from these guys.  <br />   When I popped it in to my CD player I KNEW I would be hearing something besides the same nu-metal sound--I just wanted to know where they would go--and to new heights is where. It is a solid album from a solidly talented group of professional friends who know how to produce great music. So I repeat...Google those articles before you write anymore of the same complaints about this album. Otherwise your criticisms will be quickly dismissed as written by psuedo-fans who don't even listen to what their band is saying about their music. But I digress...
B000BW7QWW|5.0|First, I loved the movie. Im a long time Sci-Fi fan(Star Wars to Star Trek to Dune to you name it and I probably loved it) and I found that this movie was awesome. Not only did it satisfy my need to know about what happened in the series(I saw the movie first but it made me watch the series and it explained a lot) but it could stand against most other films that critics love without breaking a sweat(as in it could fight them and win for the people that didn't understand that). The only downside I see to it is that it didn't make the producers continue the series.
B0000024KQ|5.0|This was Onyx's best album and most people missed it cause there was no videos or airplay of any song. It was an street album that was gritty and raw with many punchlines and full of evil and darkness. It was straight hip hop at its' best with no B/S. The best songs are Last Dayz, Mos Def, Ghetto Mentalitee, All We Got Is Us and Walk In New York. If you are like me (a fan of old school), you got to have this album. It's hard to believe it has been 12 years since this album came out and it still goes hard after all these years. It's CD's like this that will never allow me to get into the B/S that's out today.
B000MRA5NS|5.0|I like the new bond much more gritty action and story rather than relying on gadgets and some pretty boy.
630512762X|1.0|I read some of these reviewers and I wonder if they are making my food at restuarants, if they are saving lives in the ER or are the ones who run right out to buy some fools CD from American Idol, or talk in superlatives about the new Snoop Dog video that was on MTV. Do they sell tires in Spokane or crawdaddies in Batan Rouge?<br /><br />Face off is truly an atrocious film, from start to finish. Cage and Travolta have no on screen chemistry and it is so shallow, so utterly beneath me to even want to describe the assanine plot and utter paltry dialouge.<br /><br />For years I have thought this, and will continue to until I leave this medium, but Face Off is unequivically one of the worst films ever made. Pure trash.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|This has great tracks, so what if its not \\"heavy\\" as the previous ones. Like it for what it is.  <br /> <br />Hands Held High is AMAZING.
0385338600|5.0|I loved this book. It was the second Grisham novel I read, after reading the Pelican Brief. It began slow, but I knew that if I was patient the story would pick up and it really picked up. I thought I knew exactly how the story was going to end, but it ended with a twist that I never expected. Grisham is brillant and I highly recommend reading this book.
0895260131|4.0|Sirs/Ma'ams, I've just returned from some travel, and have not yet been able to start reading this book.  However, all of the reviews that I've previously read - and which were the primary reason for my purchasing this book - were very much positive.
1594489505|5.0|No long review from me - it isn't necessary.  This book is just plain great.   I read it in less than 24 hours and the story haunted me for days after.  If you loved the Kite Runner you will love this too.  Highly recommended.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Good story line, and a great series.  Sorry it didn't last long on TV.
B000ASDFJU|5.0|Great and sooo pretty. Very nice way to present the DVDs with the book and pretty pictures inside. The bonus DVD is very good too. <br />A must have for the fan of the serie
B000NA2BEU|5.0|[[ASIN:B000NA2BEU Veronica Mars - The Complete Third Season]]  <br /> <br />This show is so incredible that it is so hard to discrible it. It has suspense, mystery, Love and so much more. There is truely no show that can compare to it. It is critically aclaimed and it was a shame that the network that it was on did little to nothing to promote it. I am almost sure that it is as good as Lost maybe even better. seasons one and two were amazing as well. If you havent seen this show then you have no idea what you are missing because it is so good and addicting.
0316018953|4.0|Some reservations have been expressed concerning this new Harry Bosch novel because of the fact that it was first published in serialized form.  Not to worry.  The revised and expanded version is utterly seamless and the plot arc is solid, unpredictable, and plausible.  Harry is in fine form, tilting with the FBI, dealing with an old flame and breaking in a new partner.  The novel is not as long as the usual Michael Connelly but it is certainly long enough.  Interesting tidbit: many have noted how unrealistic 24 is in representing L.A. traffic.  In the 6th season finale Bill Buchanan was told to intercept Jack Bauer and did so in about two or three minutes--the length of time it would take to back out of your driveway.  Connelly uses L.A. traffic as a key plot element and represents it realistically (without becoming tedious in the process).  As always, his sense of place is exquisite.  The area in the Hollywood Hills, near Madonna's previous residence, is represented beautifully and plays a key role in the plot.  Bravo, Michael.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|A great continuation of the TV series.  Very well done.  Hope they make another film.
B000H6SXMY|4.0|A must have for the Friends' fan. The box is compact and very pretty, with all seasons inside.. <br />Great collection to have for this classic tv serie.
1582701709|5.0|I learned about this book from the Oprah Winfrey show and didn't quite understand what it was all about. I asked my Mentor and she had not heard of it, so I kind of forgot about it but kept asking people and finally in an email with my mentor she asked if I read \\"The Secret.\\"  So I told her that was the book I had been inquiring about and ordered it online from Amazon. I am almost finshed with it and have drawn a lot of positive energy from it.  I believe that we all somehow know \\"The Secret\\", but through this authors very profound verbage, it somehow penetrates more and the understanding is easier to comprehend.  I am seeing everything in a different light and as hard as it is to change the course of your path in life, find that I am switching lanes for the better and keeping the positive energy flowing.  I will admit it is difficult as we come from another society.  But in practicing daily and biting my lip when I hear the negative come out of my mouth, slowly I am changing paths with a little more ease.  I know that reading this book would not hurt anyone but make their lives a lot more meaningful and positive.
B000AVW9GM|1.0|A paperback novel.  I have ordered this CD several times and the sellers send me a book.  It is very frustrating!
0743243315|2.0|Introducing Nazneen, an 18-year-old who has just moved to London in an arranged marriage with a man twice her age, this story sets the stage for many interesting conflicts and adjustments. How will Nazneen, accustomed to living a quiet life in a Bangledesh village, deal with the challenges of a huge city, largely filled with white people raised with different values from her own? How will she deal with Chanu, her fat, lazy husband who fancies himself an intellectual, an unrecognized prince among paupers? More importantly, how will Nazneen deal with the tragic loss of her baby son, the only thing that really tied Chanu and herself together?    Meanwhile, Nazneen feels for her younger sister Hasina, who eloped in a love marriage that ended badly. Throughout the years, she keeps track of her sister's whereabouts through poorly-written letters, which leave Nazneen to read between the lines. If only she could bring Hasina to their home in London!    While all these issues are addressed, it happens in too plodding a way...almost like a villager in Nazneen's homeland, taking a slow walk around the land. Perhaps that's the way Ali intended it; after all, the course of real life is rarely, if ever, concise and action-packed. But in a novel, it takes a real talent to pull it off. After a while, the reader just wants to know what's happened, and move on.     Not being overly familiar with Bangledesh, with Muslims, or with immigrants in London, I found Ali's details and insight into their lives fairly interesting. But, overall, even that wasn't enough to capture and keep my interest in this book.
0440237688|1.0|Let's face it. I had to read this book for a project in school and I was misreable the whole way. I'm not a big sci fi fan, but even if you were I do not recomend this book. <br />So there's a guy named Jonas, and in his community there is no love, no nothing. I'm not going to go into much detail, but I will say this: The ending was WAY too ambiguos. the authour could have done so much more with it.  <br />I'm sorry, but buy the book if you want to, but... <br /> <br />Don'ty say I didn't warn you.   <br />
B000AYELVA|4.0|The first X-Men film is not really perfect, but in terms of it's timing and what it meant might be coming down the pike with regards to cinematic interpretations of comic books (specifically Marvel comics) it is pretty darn close to perfect. Lets face it, this is the harbinger of the comic book movie age that has, like it or not, made some exciting and high-grossing films. I personally think the majority of comic book movies fail and could care less about how much money they make, but X-Men is a bit more than that. It's a very good movie too.<br /><br />I didn't get a chance to see this in theaters but that actually served the film well in terms of how I viewed the hype. I didn't care because so many did...that's the old punk in me in guess. So I waited and received the film as an early Christmas gift the following year. I actually watched it Christmas eve and found it to be incredibly refreshing and enjoyable.<br /><br />It begins by showing us a young boy being separated from his parents at a German concentration camp in Poland. His parents are going into the camp and will be killed. The boy is desperate to save them and as the German soldiers hold him down he reaches out and somehow begins to bend the metal gates that close in his parents before being struck down by the [...] of one of the soldiers' guns. The boy is Eric Lehnsherr, one of the great all-time Marvel comic villains known as Magneto. In one fell swoop, Bryan Singer does something that I've always been glad X-Men writers did consistently, and that is allow us to sympathize with this villain.<br /><br />We are then introduced to the primary plot of a modern day Senator bent on the granting the government the ability to force registration of all mutants. Then it shows how telepathic and mind manipulating mutant Charles Xavier and his old friend and rival Magneto fundamentally disagree on how mutants as a race must react to this oncoming repression. This is followed by the introduction to our primary protagonists; Rogue, a young girl who drains the life of all people her skin makes contact with, and Wolverine, an enhanced mutant with the ability to heal himself enough that his body endured somking of skeletal replacement surgery. His skeleton is made of an indestructible metal and he also has claws made of this metal that break through his skin anytime he wants to kill someone. Great characters that Anna Paquin and Hugh Jackman are able to portray well here. Again, Singer introduces these characters with relatable depth.<br /><br />In short, Magneto wants to destroy humanity and the X-Men must stop him in an environment where they are not appreciated in the least by the public. Singer attempts to make sociological insights on those terms in addition to bringing great character depth. When you consider the number of characters and the length of the movie, these are not easy tasks to say the least. Then again, when watching the Usual Suspects it's quite obvious Singer has a knack for just this sort of thing.<br /><br />X-Men is a very good movie but I won't give it five stars because it also contains some fairly annoying dialogue that I absolutely refuse to forgive. For example, the character Storm asks the villain Toad what happens when a toad is hit by lightning and answers her own question by saying \\"the same as everything else.\\" It's not funny or witty. It serves no purpose other than to make Storm look like a big cheese ball, and that isn't really fair. Not to mention, who really cares what happens to a toad when it gets electrocuted and why is that even a question to begin with? Let's just watch the lightning bolt strike and see toad explode. That is really just a nit-picking though, as X-Men is still a very good movie and it actually gets more and more important in terms of movie history with time.oung girl who drains the life of all people her skin makes contact with, and Wolverine, an enhanced mutant with the ability to heal himself enough that his body endured somking of skeletal replacement surgery.

B00068TJM6|4.0|I found this watch to be somewhat functional but very classy. I find it hard to use the slide bezel in flight, the numbers are hard to quickly identify; and solving equasions are better done with a paper E6-B than this product. As a ground unit I found it to be very handy but many features are overkill. This unit is very sharp looking but has some work to do in the handyness department with real world flying.
0757302661|5.0|I can't believe how awesome these techniques are and my husband agrees!  The views are balanced and supported scientifically.  The CD that comes with the book is my best friend!  I fall asleep peacefully, without tightness or achiness anywhere and I sleep through the night! (no more benadryl to get rest)...This book is 'easy reading', educational, practical and applicable to all pregnancies.  <br />I tend to be more liberal than my husband when it comes to trying 'new' things...After alot of discussion, he agreed to the idea of trying something that at least in my area of the woods few people are trying during birthing (if it didn't work or we were uncomfortable we both agreed we wouldn't use the method).  I had a very bad experience with our first baby after receiving an epidural.  I felt very spiritually disconnected, probed, rushed, and not listened to during my first birthing.  This book is our missing link between feeling involved during the process of birthing and being a family unit during pregnancy (on the cd there is relaxation exercise to be done with Dad or partner) <br />Thank you Marie Mongan!  <br />A+ And my husband agrees! :) <br />
B000NA77YO|5.0|I recently purchased Black Sabbath's The Dio Years and <br />I am quite astounded. <br /> <br />The quality of the old songs is quite nice, in my <br />opinion, considering I have the first remasters of the <br />Dio albums. Quite frankly, the three new songs really <br />impressed me. I was expecting another Psycho Man <br />disaster. Psycho Man was terrible, in my opinion.  <br /> <br />Iommi's riffs in the new songs are incredible. They <br />reminded me a little of Fused in their heaviness. The <br />Devil Cried gave me goosebumps when I first heard it. <br />Shadow of the Wind was a good slow, headbanging jam. <br />Ear in the Wall, though the guitar parts really caught <br />my ear (no pun intended), the lyrics were very <br />strange. I was still quite amazed by the new songs. I <br />am more than satisfied and really hope that there is a <br />new Sabbath/Dio album in the works within the next <br />couple years. A new original Sabbath album would be <br />nice too, for that matter.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|When taking into account all the comic book movies that have hit the theater recently this may sound like a bold statement, but really it's not.  This may be a large grossing sub-genre but it isn't really that many movies we're talking about.  With X2 though, I'm inclined to go even further and say it's one of the best sci-fi action films of all time...seriously.  In terms of strictly comic book movies, it's simply either this or Batman Begins.  I say X2 wins even in that comparison, but I'm certainly willing to accept the opposite view.<br /><br />The film opens with a brilliant introduction to a crucial character, the German teleporter Nightcrawler who looks like a little blue demon but possesses an intense devotion to Catholicism, and his introduction does not serve to assist in painting him as a hero.  More of an anti-hero I guess.  I don't want to ruin it for those who haven't actually seen it but X2 opens with one of the more memorable action sequences of recent date and the film contains three more specific sequences that are just as good.  Magneto's inevitable escape from his plastic prison is one of them.<br /><br />One of the other memorable scenes sets up the real storyline for X2 quite nicely and introduces us to other mutant heroes in the process.  William Stryker, an inventive military man, is motivated by his personal experience with mutant-kind to actually organize an assault on Charles Xavier's school for mutants.  He wishes to gain access to the mutant tracking device called Cerebro and destroy all of them.  His teams' assault is truely great action-filmmaking. The X-Men and Magneto, with his loosely forming band of mutants who agree with his politics on how to respond to humanity, find a common enemy in Stryker.  The relationship established between Charles and Magneto in the first film is really important here as younger mutants develop and choose sides.  I have to say, if I were in their predicament I may certainly be swayed by Magneto's extremism.  The character developement here for supporting roles is important to note.  Mystique and Pyro are really great villains here with massive emotion behind their actions and it's never over-stated, but it enhances the meaning and consequences to action sequences so well.<br /><br />The other incredible action scene is when Bobby Drake's family calls the cops on him and his new mutant friends.  There are enough under-stated layers in this scene and the characters; Wolverine, Rogue, Bobby and Pyro, are still consistent.  The police show up and Pyro reveals his wrath.  I always get excited for that scene even though I know he's wrong in his reaction.  I mentioned four action sequences but the fun doesn't end there.  Lady Deathstryke, who has been brainwashed by Stryker, and Wolverine have a great fight scene. Other scenes during the climax are just as impressive and all the while we are given enough tid-bits of so many characters that we still manage to care and even get a bit surprised near the end.  It's a shame this wasn't pulled off in the third film.<br /><br />X2 is unique in the sense that the plot is secondary and the film's primary operative is to develop the characters for more climactic stories.  I think the screenplay succeeds in this sense but overall the screenplay (written by voice actor David Hayter) is not one of the film's strengths and can require a more robust imagination to really appreciate.  Overall though, within the context of a complete trilogy, X2 is nearly perfect.racter developement here for supporting roles is important to note.

B00006RCOB|4.0|Clint Eastwood was a great choice for the lead role in this movie. His emotional flashbacks add a nice touch to the suspense surrounding his effort to sneak into Russia and steal a high-tech airplane. While the airplane is an interesting focal point, I enjoyed more following the logistics and complications the intelligence service had to confront to get Clint to the airplane and then out of Russia.. Good entertainment, particularly for spy fans.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|If you're expecting Linkin Park and aren't open minded to something different, don't buy this album -- but that would be a big mistake.<br /><br />This is a great album. Very deep and powerful. Great melodies, amazing lyrics, and well mixed. It's just not Linkin Park. But I think it's their best album yet. Every track on the album is memorable.<br /><br />Buy the album. You won't regret it.
B000PFU7OO|4.0|movie just opened today in san francisco, and i fell in love with the movie and the music...high recommendation
B000NA28I4|2.0|thank GOD i haven't read the book, guess the movie would seem even worse.<br /><br />it's sucky enough as it is.<br /><br />plot makes no sense. well, not that i have read the sporlight review, it's clear why. so many things are missing, it makes no sense to the \\"uninitiated\\" (those of us who haven't read the book, namely, cuz we can't patch up the gaps in story with knowledge from the book). you watch the movie and you wonder why people do what they do, how did this or that come to happen.. i hate it when i don't understand the whys and hows, the script HAS to make sense in order for me to enjoy the film.<br /><br />besides that, the whole thing reminded me so BADLY of a bootleg version of LOTR it was UNBELIEVABLE. the princess, the monsters, the fortress..<br /><br />dunno. kinda sucky. LOTR's maimed and disfigured lil brother.

0060899190|5.0|A great addition to any coffee table.  Some of the confessions are hilarious, some of them so sad.  All are thought provoking. <br />This book really is something that anyone can pick up and enjoy - my husband isnt a reader and has enjoyed flicking through it many times. <br />
B000MQC9H4|3.0|When I saw that Nancy Meyer did Somethings Got to Give, I realized why this film didn't really turn me on. It had its charming moments but all in all, I found it boring at times(like the previously mentioned Something... movie) and implausible at other times. It was cute but definitely not memorable.
B000IHY9SE|2.0|Not the best album & not intended to be either. Go through itunes and pick what you like.
B000O1799U|1.0|Ugh! This film was awful. Beyonce cannot act her way out of a wet paper back and her singing is marginal, at best. Jennifer Hudson has a huge voice, but the songs are so bellowy it has little to no effect. Eddie Murphy and Jamie Foxx were just ridiculous casting. Avoid this turkey.
1569242739|5.0|I recently started eating vegan and love to bake.  I was worried about how to bake without eggs.  This book proves that there was no need to fear!  This book has a really huge selection of both gorgeous and delicious cupcakes.  My family are fully omnivorous, but no one has complained about these tasties.  The recipes are pretty easy and fast to make. It also includes on recipe for diabetics, and one for gluten free cupcakes. The downside: I am trying out all the different recipes, and baking at least 2 batches of cupcakes a week.  At this rate I might be in the news as the fastest growing person on the planet!
0618680004|5.0|I was never a \\"true believer.\\" Just 15, I spent my first 13 years a child of Catholic parents, never realizing the blatant; I wasn't religious. <br /> <br />Sure, I hadn't gone to church in over a year... I wasn't religious at all. I knew that. However, I still had a god, to whom I would cast words upon. Why did I do this? I was taught to do it. I thought I needed god.  <br /> <br />Only after I read \\"The God Delusion\\" had I realized, unequivocally, that no one needs a god to live a good, productive, long, loving, full life. God doesn't explain existence; it only hides truth, thought, and questioning. By and by, that is exactly what religion is for, embedding unquestioned faith in all. And that is why I have grown far away from religion.  <br /> <br />Now, yet only in my adolescence, I am firm in my beliefs: my belief in human spirit, accomplishment, and progress. <br /> <br />I thank Richard Dawkins, for he has brought full enlightenment to me, who was brought up in Catholic dogma. <br /> <br />I strongly suggest this to anyone, but especially those who question their faith, even a little, for this testament to science and understanding has been written for you. <br />

B000P2A256|5.0|I am not a huge fan of Maroon 5 by any means. I purchased their debut release: 'Songs About Jane' and liked probably about half of that CD. Then they kindof faded and you did not hear much about them for quite some time.<br /><br />I must say their sophmore disc: 'It Won't Be Soon Before Long' is great!!!<br /><br />Has an excellent sound to it. It has a great blend of rock, pop and some R&B to mix it up and it all works perfect. Adam Levine's voice shines on here. Maroon 5 are back with very catchy, melodic and so many radio friendly tunes.<br /><br />Every track on this set is a standout. I cannot even make a list of my favorites on here because the next song is just as brilliant as the one before it. The CD starts off great and keeps with that same tone until the last song!!<br /><br />This CD is a must have!!!!<br /><br />~~~~~~JAC  07'
B000NA28IE|1.0|Well lets begin with flaws shall we, seeing as there was nothing but flaws throughout the entirety of the film. First off, did anyone notice that when the camera was looking down on Eragon and Roran that Eragon was wearing blue jeans? Yes. Blue Jeans. Also, how about the death of Garrow? Eragon's quick change of heart went something along the lines of this: \\" Oh my god he's dead!\\" <br />Brom, \\"Just burn the old man and lets go!\\" <br />Eragon, \\"Okay. I don't really know you but lets go run away together!\\" <br />Ya.....exactly.....Lots of depth here. Lots.....Throughout the rest of the movie his weapons change constantly. He'll be carrying one bow and the next second it's not there and then all of a sudden he's carrying a completely different bow. His sword will disappear and reappear just as frequently. Setting all of that aside, was Arya even an elf in this movie?  <br />I didn't see any pointy ears. Also, why did she look like she was giving birth when she was being tortured? <br />The Urgals looked like dum human brutes. Don't even get me started about Durzas' giant moth...thing.... <br />Half the main and more interesting characters were left out or botched. Angela the old herbalist was some kind of large 18 year old girl w/ a nose ring and a thing for our great hero. All in all this movie was probably the most horrible peace of film I have ever seen. I lost a whole hour and   a half of my life that I can never get back. If you are thinking of buying this, DON'T for the love of god.  <br />
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This series was one of the best series ever on TV, but in HD it is absolutely stunning. I'm watching it with a PS3 via HDMI on a 50 inch HD TV with Dolby Digital sound, and the difference is amazing. If you already have blue-ray, get these discs. If you don't have blue-ray, this is the reason to get it.
B000OCXMAE|4.0|In few words: if you expect to hear the same LP sound from Hybrid or Meteora, you will be highly dissappointed. Doesn't mean that it's a bad record but it's like a totally different band, most of the songs are ballads, and some passages you swear you are listening U2.  <br /> <br />Buy it only if you will dare to erase all the previous paradigms and preconceptions on LP's sound to start from scratch.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|If you saw Planet Earth on the Discovery Channel, then you saw a badly watered down version of the original BBC series with David Attenborough.  Why Discovery Channel butchered it so badly is hard to understand.  They removed Attenborough's excellent and sometimes witty commentary and substituted a woman's voice with little real content.  Harsh notes masquerading as \\"music\\" was dubbed in to hype the film, which often drowned out the commentary.  Ads every few minutes further degraded the show.  If you buy this series, be sure to buy the original BBC edition with David Attenborough.  It is a superb documentary and astonishingly good photographny of scenes and wildlife around the world that you could never see on your own, no matter how much you travel.
B00006312A|4.0|The 5.1 SACD version, I was not that impressed with. However, the stereo version sounds great.  DSD was designed to archive old analog tapes and that's again what Columbia (now owned by Sony/Philips who pioneered the technology) did with this project.  If you're a Johnny fan, buy it and hear what the album was meant to sound like originally without sample rate/quantization conversions.
B00005JPAO|4.0|Authentic sets and atmosphere enhanced the movie considerably.  Acting was excellent and dramatic for the episode that was focused upon, namely the death of Dianna and the circumstances during the week of her burial. <br /> <br />Weakness to me was that the plot did not have enough weight for my personal taste, and some details were overplayed to enhance the character of the Queen.  Helen Mirren did portray the Queen adeptly, and with regalness.   <br /> <br />Strongest point was the crowd scene at the entrance to the grounds.  The glances, the small commentary gave the viewer a deep look into the nature of the Queen.  I would tend to give this movie a documentary type genre as opposed to the standard movie makers viewpoint.
0679805273|5.0|I have a new baby girl coming in September and a new grandson born 6 weeks ago.  My son brought the baby into my room to spend some time with me and I read him this book (I bought it to read to my little girl when she arrives).  My grandson absolutely loved it.  He's very alert for his age and he was looking at the pictures and smiling while I read aloud to him.  Every child born into this family will read and be read this book, it is wonderfully written and FUN to read to babies.  When they start reading I'm sure this will be one of their first.<br /><br />I also have bought [[ASIN:0679885722 Oh, Baby, the Places You'll Go! (Life Favors(TM))]]--it is equally wonderful and is written to be read to a baby in the womb.  I grew up on Dr. Suess and my children will treasure his works just as I have and still do.

B00005JPAO|5.0|A time in History that will always be looked upon as the the greatest era of all.  It is truly a magnificent time piece that will be cherised by the world.  The Queen, portrayed by Helen Mirren, is an outstanding portrait of a great woman who took over the Throne of England at a young age and continued her leadership and democracy over the decades.  It is definitely a time piece of literature to have in any one's library.
B000OCXMAE|4.0|As for the new LP album, it's the album I knew Linkin Park could make if they tried hard enough.  I COMPLETELY enjoyed Hybrid Theory although, personally, Meteora may as well have called Hybrid Theory...Again.<br /><br />Minutes To Midnight is truly an incredible accomplishment for these guys.  Linkin Park is no longer hiding behind a cacophony of guitar, drum, and studio baroque and instead have stepped out in front of the noise to prove that they are incredibly talented musicians.<br /><br />Instead of attempting to keep LP pigeon-holed into a dying musical style, why not celebrate the fact that they have proven they have what it takes to move on to the next level.<br /><br />I suppose those of you here who want to hear LP re-record Hybrid Theory every three years would have been happy with the Beatles never having recorded \\"Sgt. Pepper's\\" because it didn't sound like \\"I Want To Hold Your Hand\\"?<br /><br />Kudos to Linkin Park for delivering, when compared with their previous work, something fresh and daring.<br /><br />P.S. The last 90 seconds of Valentine's Day are incredible. ;)
B000LXH0AE|5.0|I really really enjoyed this movie. I saw it in theatres too, so I knew what I was getting into upon purchasing it.
B00005JPD0|3.0|My Review:  I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say...This was not Denzel's best! I know he's adored by millions of people, myself included, but this movie was just o.k at best. The whole time travel thing was interesting, and it made for a very complex plot, but the ending that everyone seems to be bragging about failed to impress me. Frankly, I'm still puzzled by what they were trying to say at the end. I know at this point in his career it seems like Denzel can do no wrong, but trust me, this movie wasn't as great as so many people try to make it sound. I'll be honest, Denzel is one of those actors that never cease to amaze you. Everytime you think he'll never top himself after his latest film...he does! I just felt like this movie was missing something. It was like lukewarm water, and everytime you expect it to start boiling, it never does. The pace and tone is set in the beginning, and it never really builds any real momentum. Don't get me wrong, it held my attention, and I wasn't bored, but nor was I on the egde of my seat either.    Summary of the film: In the beginning of the film a ferry full of soldiers, women, and children is blown away killing everyone aboard. Of course, that raises the question... was it an accident? or, was it done deliberately? was it an act of terrorism? or, was it done right here at home? Of course, Denzel plays Doug Carlin (an ATF Agent) that's determined to get to the bottom of this. He's convinced that the key to finding the culprit lies with a murder victim. The body of a very beautiful young lady washed ashore just prior to the bombing. After being totured and burned alive of course, and meant to look like she was just another casualty on the ship as well. From there, it's his mission to find out who killed her because once he finds her killer he'll have found the person responsible for the bombing. Of course, since she's already dead that's where the time travel comes in at. An elite team of scientist have figured out a way togo at least 4 days into the past. That's where the fun begins.    Conclusion: That's the story in a nutshell. It's not a bad storyline or plot. The acting is pretty good, and there are quite a few familiar faces. It's just not something I would brag about.

1591841666|5.0|It is impossible to ignore what Seth Godin has to say and how he says it. That's remarkable. In this small volume (only 80 pages and about the size of a greeting card), Godin shares some LARGE ideas, one of which is indicated in the title of my review. Here is a cluster of Godinesque assertions:<br /><br />All our successes are the same. All our failures, too.<br />We succeed when we do something remarkable.<br />We fail when we give up too soon.<br />We succeed when we are the best in the world at what we do.<br />We fail when we get distracted by tasks we don't have the guts to quick.<br />Quit the wrong stuff.<br />Stick with the right stuff.<br />Have the guts to do one or the other.<br /><br />In 1963, Peter Drucker made an assertion with which Seth Godin presumably agrees: \\"There is surely nothing quite so useless as doing with great efficiency what should not be done at all.\\"<br /><br />Both Drucker and Grodin are diehard pragmatists.  My guess (only a guess) is that each learned lessons of greatest value to them from their failures rather than from their successes, that both of them (at least occasionally) felt like giving up and sometimes did, making a bad decision by quitting \\"the right stuff\\" or sticking with \\"the wrong stuff.\\"<br /><br />I presume to offer an example of what Godin seems to have in mind. All of us begin each day with the best of intentions. Let's say our objective is to produce more and better results in less time. OK, that's a worthy objective. Then let's say, that doesn't happen. Perhaps how we pursue the objective isn't working but we don't quit our method. (Albert Einstein once suggested that insanity is \\"doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.\\") Or let's say that our method is the right one but we are impatient with the immediate results, quit on that method, and try another.<br /><br />Here's the challenge: When encountering what Godin characterizes as \\"the Dip\\" (i.e. a temporary setback which creates a \\"moment of truth\\"), know the difference(s)  between \\"the right stuff\\" and \\"the wrong stuff\\" and proceed accordingly.<br /><br />So many decisions in life are gambles (i.e. \\"knowing when to hold and when to fold\\") in that they must be made without complete information and thus require a combination of knowledge, judgment, instinct, and faith.<br /><br />A careful reading of Godin's book will increase the reader's knowledge and improve her or his judgment. He helps his reader to answer questions such as these:<br /><br />\\"Is this a Dip, a Cliff, or a Cul-de-Sac?<br /><br />\\"If it's a Cul-de-Sac, how can I manage it into a Dip?\\"<br /><br />\\"Is my persistence going to pay off in the long run?\\"<br /><br />\\"When should I quit? I need to know now, not when I'm in the middle of it, and not when part of me is begging to quit.\\"<br /><br />\\"If I'm going to quit anyway, will it increase my ability to get through the Dip on something more important?\\"<br /><br />Finding correct answers to questions such as these may not sharpen one's instincts (although I suspect they could) but the answers will at least strengthen one's faith in the correctness of the decision, whatever that decision may be, when the next Dip occurs.ght stuff\\" and \\"the wrong stuff\\" and proceed accordingly.

0440237688|5.0|A dystopian novel from a child's point of view.  Most dystopian novels are written from the viewpoint of an adult who is fighting against the goverment and/or ideologies of the current world.  In The Giver, Lowry gives us the other side, a child who is happy and content with the world he lives in.  He later comes to see his world as oppressive and cruel, but it is this learning that makes this a unique and important work in the world of dystopian fiction. The prose and structure of the book are a bit more elementary (as this is a young adult book) and the story line more straight forward, but these do not detract from the lessons learned.  Not to be missed.

I like some of his songs and have all of his CDs but the only thing about havings this DVD and seeing him do the songs I like is I have to look at him play with himself and do obscene things on stage with his band members,equipment and anything else with matter in it. The costumes and makeup wouldnt be so bad if he didnt act like some drugged ape that just escaped lock up. You may call it rock theatre which it is but I've seen others do shows that werent like this. Even Alice Cooper was better on stage. Good for some of the music but watching his perversions and wooden doll antics is the reason I dont like this DVD.

However, if you are a pessimistic person who always blames others for your lack of success then reading this book could give you a new perspective. It's a no lose situation, if you have a positive attitude good things will come to you. It as simply as smiling more. Those who smile get better service and are reward more often. How you present yourself is how you are perceive. Sometimes we all need to be reminded that we reap what we sow, and this book does exactly that.

B00005OM4Q|5.0|Uplifting coming-of-age stories generally don't do it for me. That is, unless they include great dialogue, comedy and drama, top-notch performances and a fantastic soundtrack. And that's exactly what multiple Oscar nominee \\"Almost Famous\\" has going for it. Of course, the fact that the main character lives out my dream of touring with a rock band doesn't hurt, either. <br /> <br />\\"Almost Famous\\" takes place during the early '70s, an era when rock legends such as Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath and The Who were in their prime. It's into this milieu that William Miller (Patrick Fugit), an earnest 15-year-old, finds himself thrust when he scores a Rolling Stone magazine assignment to cover a rising rock band called Stillwater. Against the odds, Fugit works his way into the inner circle of the band, initially winning their respect through his knowledge of their music. <br /> <br />What begins as a short assignment turns into a multiple-month odyssey during which Patrick follows the band as it tours and grows from a second-tier rock group into superstars. Several compelling relationships develop along the way, including a unique friendship between William and the band's guitarist, Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup), and a touching bond between William and Penny Lane (Kate Hudson), a Stillwater groupie who prefers to be referred to as a Band-Aid. As dissension brews and excess rages within the band, Patrick is faced with a difficult decision: tell the band's real story and sell-out its members, or write a powder-puff boring article that might end his journalistic career. <br /> <br />If the characters and their relationships with one another seem startlingly real in \\"Almost Famous,\\" that's because director/screenwriter Cameron Crowe (\\"Say Anything,\\" \\"Jerry Maguire\\") based the story on his own experiences. As a result, Crowe gets every little detail right, from the band interactions to family dynamics to the music itself, to the point where you may start wondering whether this Stillwater band is real or fiction. Was \\"Almost Famous\\" robbed of a Best Picture nomination? You bet your a--. <br /> <br />The brilliant ensemble cast wonderfully compliments Crowe's razor-sharp writing skills. In the lead role, the underrated Fugit is utterly believable. Academy Award nominee Hudson gives a performance that's simultaneously sexy, strong and vulnerable. Crudup is by turns obnoxious, kind, egotistical and funny. And Jason Lee again showcases his fine comic touch as Stillwater's lead singer, especially when he attacks Russell for hogging too much of the limelight: \\"I'm the frontman, and you're the guitarist with mystique!\\" <br /> <br />The best movies often draw you into their world and allow you to share their characters' fears, loves, sadness and joy. In \\"Almost Famous,\\" we share William's exhilaration as he lives the life of a rock star, and his sadness as he experiences the darker side of life and love. Ultimately, William loses his innocence, but manages to maintain his hopefulness. \\"Almost Famous\\" is the rare film that earns its feel-good sentiment by showing us the humor and heartbreak along the way to achieving it.
0143038419|4.0|I wasn't enthused when my book club chose this.  The travel memoir as tale of self-discovery has been done.  But reading Elizabeth Gilbert is like catching up with your funniest, most sensitive friend.  Unlike other reviewers, I really didn't need her to offer up any post-divorce wisdom, observations on Indian poverty, or anthropological insights on the Balinese.  I can get that elsewhere.  This book entertains.  Yes, she can come off as self-indulgent (claiming to pass on meeting the Dali Lama -- as if).  But I couldn't help liking her and I thoroughly enjoyed her company.  This is a good, fun, summer read.  Maybe the title misleads;  wisdom seekers can skip it.
B0002F6BRE|4.0|The yuletide season always brings a handful of holiday-themed releases, but most of them are pure humbug. It's only every five years or so that a true holiday classic comes along. Elf, from actor/director Jon Favreau (\\"Swingers\\"), tries to buck that trend by dressing Will Ferrell in tights and putting his comic skills to the test.  <br /> <br />Ferrell plays Buddy, a human who grew up among Santa's elves. When he was a baby, he snuck into Santa's bag on Christmas Eve and wasn't discovered until Santa was back at the North Pole. Papa Elf (Bob Newhart) \\"adopted\\" Buddy and raised him. But now, Buddy is sticking out like a sore thumb within the elf community because of his ungainly size, unable to perform classic elf functions like toy building. <br /> <br />Buddy decides the answer to his problems is to seek out his human father Walter (James Caan) in New York City. Walter is the stereotypical big-business prick, and initially wants nothing to do with his elf-son freak. That leaves Buddy to inadvertently score a job at a department store, which leads to a romance with fellow store employee Jovie (Zooey Deschanel) and much hilarity when Buddy prepares for a visit from \\"Santa,\\" thinking the real deal is on the way. When he sees that the store-hired Santa is actually an imposter, hilarious havoc ensues. <br /> <br />Walter slowly starts to warm to Buddy, who befriends his wife (Mary Steenburgen) and neglected son (Daniel Tay). But as Buddy becomes an increasingly disruptive presence at Walter's workplace, the fragile new family bond is threatened. Things comes to a head on Christmas Eve, naturally, as Santa begins his toy-delivering run and Walter desperately tries to make an 11th hour book sale. <br /> <br />Director Favreau and his crew deserve props for their work in creating the elf community. By using forced perspective and some cool animation techniques, they do a great job of building a unique world that captures the feel of the classic \\"Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer\\" and \\"Frosty The Snowman\\" animated holiday specials. <br /> <br />The screenplay, by newcomer David Berenbaum, is best when it places Ferrell in inventive fish-out-of-water scenarios. The story does stoop to formulaic scenarios from time-to-time, but it's a little more forgivable in this instance, since we're talking about a Christmas movie. The cast is also a mixed bag. Former Academy Award nominees Caan and Steenburgen are largely wasted in thankless roles, but Newhart and Deschanel make the most of theirs. <br /> <br />Fortunately, when the film threatens to get stuck in syrupy cliche, the wacky Ferrell comes to the rescue. He pulls out all the stops in an off-the-wall comedic performance that will have you in stitches. From wild slapstick to nuanced facial expressions, this is pure comedic genius at work. <br /> <br />It remains to be seen whether \\"Elf\\" becomes a new holiday classic, but thanks to Ferrell, it's definitely no lump of coal. It's a great way to have some holiday fun and raise your Christmas spirits.

055358202X|1.0|I *loved* the first three A Song of Ice and Fire books and read and reread them over and over. Unfortunately, this latest installment is not up to par. It lacks the tight writing, careful plotting, action, and nuanced characterization that made books 1-3 great. Instead, we get a bit of a bloated mess. Old POVs that were central to books 1-3 -- Tyrion, Dany, Jon -- are missing, and the two new POVs -- Cersei and Brienne -- are flat and dull. Even worse are the numerous one-shot POVs that Martin introduces, who interrupt the narrative and make the novel feel disjointed, but aren't around long enough to make you care.    More than anything, AFFC just feels indulgent. The book is filled with plodding, excruciatingly descriptive chapters about the ASOIAF world that don't do much to move the plot forward. Half the  chapters consist of characters traveling from point A to point B, or they feel like info-dumps. What happened to the story? Although the plot picks up in the last quarter of the book, it was genuinely difficult to slog through the first three-quarters, where it isn't much of an exaggeration to say that nothing happens. The book could easily have been half the size.    Let's hope the next one is better!
B0000027RL|5.0|Whether or not a rock lover still thinks that Nirvana was better than Pearl Jam, they have to admit that Pearl Jam's roots came from elsewhere. Whereas Nirvana sounds as if Joy Division's lyrics were mixed with loud Pixies rock, Pearl Jam almost takes grunge rock back to the 70's.<br /><br />Pearl Jam's loud grunge rock sounds more like the scream-rock of Iggy Pop and the Stooges. The 4/4 rock beat of \\"Even Flow\\", the electrifying guitar solos and Eddie Vedder's screaming voice literally sounds like it was taken from the Stooges album \\"Raw Power.\\" However, singer Eddie Vedder's lyrics are drastically different than any rock album before--they deal with homicidal mothers, unnerving sexuality and poverty. Certainly Vedder has the aggression of Iggy Pop--however, the lyrics pierce directly into subjects which are not easy to talk about.<br /><br />Most of all, Stone Gossard's electrifying solos are the focus of Pearl Jam. In fact, Gossard goes above and beyond the Stooge's guitar solos. Whereas the grunge rock band Rage Against the Machine experimented with making his guitar sound not like a guitar, Gossard is a master at playing awesome solos with his guitar. I would even dispute that he was the best electric guitarist of the 90s, and that only Soundgarden's soloist could stand a chance against Gossard.<br /><br />Pearl Jam produced many other albums after this, but this debut is where Pearl Jam was most explosive, thought-provoking and entertaining. Go get it if you're a grunge fan--you won't think twice about this purchase.

After this happens he must save the world from something he doesn't know anything about.   <br /> Scorpia was written by Anthony Horowitz.  I liked the pace of the book. It didn't drag on.  It was full of action and thrill.  I personally would have wanted him to stay on the dark side longer, maybe for a book then switch back. <br />
B0001XALT6|4.0|Discounting the stars in this film, I believe that it exposes a common human failing of authority and corruption. We need to be reminded that not only law enforcement but elected officials as well are prone to the very same desires and needs that we experience. Their office and the esteem we bestow on them, is all irrelevant as they are victims of the same human frailties that they prosecute. This film functions as an exposure of our common traits, illnesses, weaknesses and pliability when faced with dilemas.
0307346609|5.0|World War Z is a great novel about the zombie war and the takeover of most of the world.  It is written in interview form and a man goes around talking to a lot of people, I really like it that way because it covers a lot of people's opinions and views on the book.  There are a lot of different people from a lot of different places talking about how they survived all the close encounters that they had. I really loved this book. I finished it in what was about 3 days.  I had it with me everywhere I went.
B000FVQM2Y|4.0|What absolute negativity our children must endure. This is a film of children (OK, teens) dealing with things that should not be visited upon adults. A few may dismiss this film as being unrealistic, nihilistic, or simply a dark fantasy. Having lived in one of the most populous cities in the U.S., and then living in one of the most isolated, I can only see the universal truth in this film. Drugs are to kids now days to what sex was to boomers. The muse has turned dark and deadly for today's children. At least this film has the cajones to bring our collective secret out into the open. No, we are not a privleged country. No, our children are not squeaky clean. We face daunting challenges and it's films like this that can make us aware.
0812550706|5.0|Enders Game is one of the best science fiction bocks of all time. It's suspenseful and there's a new conflict for our hero ender around every corner. Ender is a small boy who has the intellect of a genius and the strategy skills of a 4 star general.  Ender faces Problems from his evil brother to battling an alien race with far more superior fire power and number. I would recommend this book to any who likes science-fiction or if they just want to read a book and not get bored. Ala in all 10 out of 10 stars!! <br />.  <br />
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I remember seeing previews for this show and thinking I'd give it a try.  I'll give the first episode a try and see what I think about it.  I loved it!  And with each new episode I loved it even more.      Not many people know about this show (which was evident when I started asking nearly everyone I knew if they had seen it).      It is very well written and the acting of Michael C. Hall is superb.  Many people may know him from Six Feet Under.  I've seen every episode of Six Feet Under and figured I was not going to be able to shake the thought of his character on that show.  I was wrong.  Within minutes of watching the first episode all thoughts of David Fisher (his character on S.F.U.) were gone.      Michael plays the title character of this show.  A serial killer who works for the Miami police department as a blood spatter analyst.  The catch?  He only kills the ones that truly deserve it.  People who, for whatever reason, have eluded detection.  Through the course of the 1st season the Miami police are after a serial killer with a very unique style.  One that reminds Dexter of himself.      This show, as I said earlier, is beautifully written and the directing is excellent as well.  It was nominated for several Emmy's and I believe it won one.      If you like crime dramas buy this dvd!  If you're not a fan of crime dramas (which, by-the-way, I am not) I would still suggest giving this show a glance or two, or three, or four........
0142407380|5.0|Ark Angel, by Anthony Horowitz is an exceptional book about a teenage spy named Alex Rider.  If you like adventure and suspense, you will love this thrilling book.  Alex Rider is 14 years old and works for M16 in England.  He has saved the world several times and has barely escaped death in each of his missions.  In this book he starts out in a hospital and ends up trying to save the world.  He battles a terrorist group called force three.  Alex puts all the clues and figures out the reality of force three.  This superior spy even makes a trip into space to stop a deadly disaster.  This book contains so many unexpected events which make it unpredictable and interesting.  I enjoyed it because it has so much action and suspense.  I like how Anthony Horowitz wrote this book.  I hope you will read this book too.  I know you won't be disappointed.
B00000DG1R|5.0|Few bands during the 1980s churned out as many recognizable pop hits as Duran Duran, and this \\"Greatest\\" CD captures them all. The guys in Duran Duran (no matter the band lineup) always had an ear for melody, great vocals and exotic sounds. Plus, they carried on as a true band, with everybody writing and contributing. If you like the band's radio hits, then this CD is a must-have; songs one through 13 have been played on the radio for eons. What drew me to this disc, however, was the tunes that aren't as well known.<br /><br />Besides just catchy, synth-laden pop, Duran Duran were capable of adding soul to their sound (\\"I Don't Want Your Love\\"), a cold but sexy club-music vibe (\\"All She Wants Is\\") and real emotion and exoticism (\\"Come Undone\\"). Songs from the first three Duran Duran records are well represented here, and nice offerings from the same era such as \\"A View to a Kill\\" and \\"Wild Boys\\" are also present.<br /><br />Duran Duran also had a nice, somewhat reinvented run in the 1990s, especially the early `90s. The songs \\"Serious,\\" \\"Ordinary World,\\" \\"Come Undone\\" and \\"Electric Barbarella\\" (from [[ASIN:B000002TY9 Medazzaland]]) prove that. \\"Serious,\\" from 1990, sounds like a wonderful `80s leftover, updated in an organic fashion for the new decade, while \\"Skin Trade,\\" a tune released in 1986, has a slick, catchy sound, but also displays some real soul and great vocal work by Simon LeBon. Though they barely received any radio airplay, each of these tunes could lay claim to being two of the strongest tracks on \\"Greatest,\\" a CD that is chock full of classics. My only complaint is that \\"Too Much Information\\" from [[ASIN:B000002V1D Duran Duran 2 (The Wedding Album)]] was left off, but beggars can't be choosers. Many non-hits by the band have been great, but if you're looking for your fix of the most popular Duran Duran music over the years, this CD is the way to go.
B000LC55F2|3.0|Sorry it had just too too many cute things for me to enjoy it.It isn't till the end of the movie that it becomes clear WHY the wife of one of the main characters knew when her husband said 'I love you' and he meant it and the days when he said it and he didn't mean it ... She says that the day he means it  makes her life worthwhile' ....       I dont want to spoil the movie but maybe she should have put a magic marker big X on his rear ..... HMMMMM       Ever since I saw the 'Ipcress File' I am a Micheal Cane junkie so The Prestiege got 3 stars otherwise .... well I would have made this movie disappear much faster than the birds they made disappear......      If you are a Micheal Cane 'nut' get this movie if not then better to put your hand on the window sill and slam the window shut ... you'll enjoy that more than this movie!!
B000MGUZM0|4.0|There's something about Arcade Fire's sound on this album that oftentimes reminds me of an updated 1960s sound. Songs like \\"Black Mirror,\\" \\"Keep the Car Running,\\" \\"Antichrist Television\\" and \\"The Well and the Lighthouse\\" have a throbbing, somewhat retro sound that's immediately enduring. \\"Lighthouse\\" even ends with a kind of nostalgic doo-wop vibe. Add in instruments like the violin, piano, cello, synth and the kitchen sink, and you've got the recipe for some exciting, different music. Singer Win Butler sounds great when he's in his baritone range, and it doesn't get much more hip and baritone than on the great \\"Antichrist Television Blues,\\" where he sounds like a young Elvis making his musical way in the world.<br /><br />Whereas Arcade Fire's debut CD, [[ASIN:B0002IVN9W Funeral]], had a beautiful but plodding touch at times, \\"Neon Bible\\" has a more immediate feel. And speaking of beautiful, the organ-drenched \\"Intervention\\" is as sublime as a song can be, a churchlike tune that contains great lyrics and eventually makes its way to rocking out.<br /><br />Vocalist and multi-talented instrumentalist Regine Chassagne does her usual great job providing background vocals, and she contributes mightily on the interesting \\"Black Wave/Bad Vibrations,\\" which, as the title would indicate, sounds like two separate songs. At about one minute, thirty seconds into the song, Chassagne's graceful voice amid a kind of poppy 1980s sound gives way to Butler's vocals, whose section of the song comes off as thicker and more intense. Undoubtedly, Butler and Chassagne keep things interesting when they collaborate on vocals. The poppy tune \\"Rebellion (Lies)\\" from \\"Funeral\\" is the song that piqued my interest in this band, and it was Chassagne's stellar vocals during the chorus that sucked me in right away.<br /><br />Many of these songs have the same high standard of sound that drew me to \\"Rebellion,\\" albeit in a less overtly pop way. There's simply an elegance and grace to Arcade Fire that's unusual for a rock band. The last two songs, \\"No Cars Go\\" and \\"My Body is a Cage,\\" close the album out well and leave listeners with a sense of wanting more. The upbeat \\"No Cars Go\\" has a cool \\"Hey!\\" shout throughout and a good synth sound to boot. A great organ sound also pervades \\"My Body is a Cage,\\" a tune that begins with a mysterious, low-key vibe but explodes with a vengeance midway through. Butler's cry of \\"set my body (and spirit) free\\" to close out the song and album gives one the feeling that this band hopes to expand its wings and musical vocabulary to ever-growing horizons, which can only be a good thing.ck band.

0316018953|4.0|I enjoyed Overlook as much as any other Bosch story. Yes it is short but it gets right into it rather than having fifty pages of set up and history that is not necessary if you have read the other novels. Overlook is fast pased with  enough twists and turns that the pages just fly by.  <br /> <br />Harry is as good as he ever was. The plot is modern and plausible and the characters are well defined. The setting is true to life. For a Los Angeles native reading Overlook is like a drive around town.  <br /> <br />
B000O75F7C|3.0|It must be difficult to consistently produce stellar music...perhaps almost impossible.  Porcupine Tree has, with Fear of a Blank Planet, made a CD that pales in comparison to the rest of its catalogue. <br /> <br />I purchased Stupid Dream in 1999 to see what this weird-named band might have to offer.  I was instantly hooked: The sweeping melodies, haunting rhythms, and unforgettable songs.  Stupid Dream and In Absentia are near perfect.....Lightbulb Sun not far behind.  Older PT is pretty good.  Deadwing took awhile, but I like it now.  Fear of a Blank Planet, after 4 listens, is just not in the same league.  I hate to say it, its almost boring and forgettable....and I really want to give PT the benefit of the doubt. <br /> <br />Fear of a Dark Planet has a few moments, but not enough to make me want to listen to the songs again...perhaps it will grow on me like Deadwing.  The songs are fairly straight-forward, have a hint of the PT sound (Wilson's voice, etc.), more 'Deadwing' style guitars, and classic PT drums.  The similarities end there.  No sweeping, soaring choruses reminiscent of songs from the Stupid Dream to In Absentia period (evidently, now the 'golden age' of Porcupine Tree).  I have no problems with bands going in new directions (it is progressive after all), but the standards should remain the same. <br /> <br />Seems to me that Wilson has used Blackfield (side project with Avi Geffen) to produce his more melodic and palpable music and Porcupine Tree to produce a heavier, grinding style of rock.  If you think about it, older PT is a beautiful combination of the two styles (In Absentia being a perfect example).  Steve Wilson has split personality disorder. <br /> <br />I can't recommend Fear of A Blank Planet.  It's not necessarily bad, it just pales in comparison to the rest of the band's music.  I do highly recommend Porcupine Tree and both Blackfield CDs
0792839730|5.0|A Bridge Too Far was one of the last epic WWII films. It cannot help but be linked to The Longest Day because they are both from Cornelius Ryan's books. <br />One of the differences in style from the previous film is the type of stars used for the main characters. Whereas Longest Day used many long-established stars, many who had been around for decades, the stars of Bridge are almost exclusively of contemporary vintage such as Robert Redford, Gene Hackman, Ryan O'Neal, Elliot Gould, Anthony Hopkins, etc. Even Connery and Caine, who reached stardom in the Sixties are only in their mid-forties at this time. Unfortunately, and this is my only complaint, Attenborough chose to go with the trendy \\"Great Gatsby\\" style glow with the cinematography. The humor put into Longest Day is almost totally absent from Bridge and further contributes to its modern realism. Speaking of realism, those familiar with the writing of Panzer commander Hans Von Luck will appreciate the effort and money spent on the war action. It is spectacular. The artillery shelling is fearsome, the airborne assault is awesome, and the boat attacks are hellish. <br />Mr. Attenborough impressively helms this massive story, keeping track of the big picture while drawing in the the viewer with short, poignant individual exploits. The most memorable of these lasts only a few seconds as the Dutch father turns to see his son, who has been so brave and helpful, has been killed by a stray bullet. The horror of war in that moment is more real than the entire three hours of movies like Apocalypse Now. Shortly after that, the camera fills the frame with a monstrous German tank, firing mercilessly straight toward you. <br />Of the star-studded cast, Connery, Caan, and Hopkins shine the most. James Caan gets one of the best scenes in the movie: a wild jeep ride through German lines to save a buddy. If Steve McQueen had been in the movie, this would have been his role, but Caan does it quite well enough. Sean Connery wasreportedly miffed that Redford got more than he did for much less screen time. Sean has a point, he's outstanding and convincing in his role, while Redford is pretty much playing Redford. Anthony Hopkins, whose star was rising at this point, puts another notch in his career as the Tommy paratrooper Colonel who's sent to do the impossible. Much of Gene Hackman's performance of the Polish general is presenting a frustrated man who fully realizes the FUBAR scenario that he must participate in. On the minus side,Ryan O'Neal seems too youthful to be a general and Michael Caine has so little to do one wonders if there isn't quite a bit of extra footage laying around somewhere. Not that the film needs it, but it would be a nice DVD treat. <br />A Bridge Too Far is a great film. It's a pity Attenborough couldn't have assembled a similar cast and crew and gone on to make the definitive film version of Battle of the Bulge. That would have supplied the one thing lacking from Bridge-a victory. <br />
0439597404|4.0|I love this series for the beginning chapter book reader.  There are not many pages so the story gets to the climax rather quickly which helps keep children's attention.  I thought the chapters were a little long (about 15 pages) for the younger group, but many of those have pictures on them so they're not too bad.  I think it's a nice story about siblings working together and becoming a part of this whole other world that only they know about.  This series really reminds me of the Lemony Snickett Series.  I would recommend this to others.
B000NVIXDW|4.0|Buble opens up the DVD with \\"The Best Is Yet To Come\\" and he really does justice to the song.  He has his own style, but the difference here is that he sings many of his songs in a different manner.  What I mean is, there is no one Buble style.  If you were to hear this tune from an artist that was not the one who made it a hit, it would come out a little flat.  Buble, though, has his own approach to the music.  Sometimes he gets it spot on, sometimes a little short.  I like all of the songs on this DVD, just some more than others.<br /><br />It Had Better Be Tonight I heard for the first time when it was first played in Los Angeles, what a great way to start the day.  Great up beat tune, great Latin beat.  It is different, but nice different.<br /><br />Me And Mrs. Jones sound nice too, but really, Billy Paul's reverb was unbeatable.  Comin' Home Baby is a great tune, Call Me Irresponsible is well done, Everything is done well also, I've Got The World On A String, now I like to sing to this as it is playing.  Always On My Mind, he does justice to this song, his smooth voice gives it a new sound, he is more crooning in this song than in most others.  That's Life, a good rendition of a Sinatra song. I feel he is trying to be Buble singing a Sinatra song, so it comes out fine.  Dream, I watch the movie the 'Dream Team' once in awhile, sorry, this song will never be the same again to me, but Buble does a fine job.<br /><br />Overall this is a great DVD again.  Buble is definately a central part of our music library.  Listen and enjoy.
B000OCXFCO|5.0|Sure it isn't old school Megadeth, but this is as close as they have gotten since Countdown.  \\"Sleepwalker\\" is a solid opener to the album with its machine gun riffs.  \\"Washington Is Next\\" really good song, catchy riffs and solo's.  \\"Play For Blood\\" & \\"Blessed Are The Dead\\" are really stand out tracks to me.  \\"Play for Blood\\" packs so many solos into its almost 4 minute run time.  The new version of \\"A Tout Le Monde\\" feels a bit out of place but still good.  The only dud on this album to me is \\"Amerikanistan\\". <br />
B00070Q7VO|5.0|Buble has brought back the melodies of yesterday with new tunes of his own today.  His smooth sounding voice, his passion are just excellent.  Some say his Genre is Bobby Darin, but Buble has a style all his own.  On this DVD you will hear the sound of the boogy beat and big band.  You want to dance, you want to sing and swoon.  Many of the tunes you will hear, you will hear for the first time, because it is sung in a different way.  Quando, Quando, Quando is just beautiful with the lilting voice of Nelly Furtado.  Home, a new song when this was released, has passion.  Save the last dance has a nice twist to it.  This is definate worth the price and worth having in your collection of great music.
1582701709|2.0|First, it is very interesting to note the pattern of reviews of this book. Any time there is a review with only 1 or 2 stars, it is immediately followed on the same day by several 4 or 5 star reviews, hailing the book, but without any detail as to why.  About half of these immediate response 4 and 5 star reviewers have reviewed nothing except this book (perhaps we will see more reviews from them after this, in an effort to discredit me).  I became suspicious when it happened first within minutes of posting my review, and a few more showed up within just a few hours of posting my review, so I went back and examined the review pattern.  In my opinion, it looks like some of the stellar reviews are phony responses in an attempt to keep the book's star rating up.<br /><br />Now for my substantive review:<br /><br />Spoiler Alert:  The Secret is the Law of Attraction.  So read The Law of Attraction by Michael J. Losier.  It is a lot of the same idea, but much more down to earth and more scientific explanation than The Secret.<br /><br />I am a big fan of positive psychology.  But the Secret gets more religious, with its \\"You are God\\" and \\"the Universe is your Genie\\" talk.  Interestingly, it cites the Bible several times, but then refers to the Universe instead of God, except to say that you are God and you are your creator.  That becomes a religious teaching, and one that I don't buy into.<br /><br />The beginning of the book is also a little misleading.  It starts with you making all your wishes in \\"The Secret\\"  format by converting your \\"I don't want X\\" to \\"I do want Y\\" language, because you will get whichever one you say, X or Y, whether you want it or not (The Law of Attraction book explains scientifically and psychologically why this matters).  Later in the book, it qualifies all your wishful thinking, all your genie-Universe-making desires, with a chapter on . . . oh but your actions cannot contradict your wishes or you won't get what you wanted.  Well duh.<br /><br/>The Secret claims that any time you think \\"I do not want X,\\" you will bring X to you because you have identified it and sent out a vibration for it.  The Law of Attraction explains that identifying what we do not want actually helps us to clarify what we do want (think of a toddler's development and their fascination with the word \\"no\\" once they learn to harness its power).  Knowing what we want AND what we don't want is essential to decision-making.<br /><br />The book does encourage some basic, generally accepted concepts, such as \\"love is the most important thing\\" and \\"think positively.\\"  It also sort of implies a notion that I actually learned in greater detail as a teenager fifteen years ago (in a protestant church, FWIW), which is:  thoughts lead to emotion, emotion leads to action, actions lead to habits, habits lead to character, and character becomes your destiny.  So in that sense, The Secret is correct that in that where you are now is a reflection of what you have thought in the past.  But without fleshing out these concepts, it just says you sent out your vibration into the universe and it came back to you . . . or came back to bite you . . . depending on whether your vibration was positive or negative (i.e. \\"you reap what you sow\\").  I can buy the positive psychology aspect of the book (I have seen positive psychology at work in my own life), but not the grandiose religious aspect, and in no way would I ever consider it to be the all-encompassing 100% absolute end-all-be-all answer to Life.<br /><br />If you are looking for a new age version of positive psychology turned religion, this book is for you.  If not, read The Law of Attraction and your spiritual book of choice instead.

B0000X61VE|5.0|Good music and great backgrounds, but it will sure kick your butt...<br /><br />Don't do the whole thing the first time, even if you think you can.<br /><br />You WILL feel it the next day.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
0205313426|5.0|I should have had this book during my grad student years while I taught a technical writing course for engineers. The full time instructor spontaneously vanished, so myself and another teaching assistant were left to teach the class with only a syllabus and a lame textbook. For about a year and a half I taught that course and was convinced it was impossible to teach grammar - but I didn't have the right tool. I changed the syllabus repeatedly, whittling away and some larger goal that I couldn't define. I just couldn't get the difference between active and passive speech through their heads (among other things), so I settled for the tried and true Intro-Body-Conclusion ten pager essay and graded them on format and execution. I tried to use context to pull them out of poor habits, but I still had paper titles like \\"The Internet in the United State's\\" (sic).<br /><br />Some time later, when I was doing research, writing papers, and beginning my thesis work, a light went off in my head. I remembered an internship I had where my mentor told me to pick up a copy of a writing handbook, and for some reason I kept thinking \\"Charlotte's Web?\\" in my head. I Googled the book and eventually found Strunk and White. The day I got it I instantly recognized its value.<br /><br />Tucked away in this short and concise little book are gold nuggets of information. Besides the well known tips about prepositions and run ons, there are well-written examples of commonly misused words, such as \\"comprise\\" and \\"effectual\\". The examples are hilarious and perfectly suited for instruction. The book is not a disorganized lump of opinions about writing style, rather it is well sorted with bold and italics to set off rules and lists about certain elements of style that should be considered by any writer.<br /><br />I give this book as a gift to anybody taking on a writing endeavor, and I keep my own copy on my bookshelf at work. I was tempted to put \\"As a matter of fact (comma)\\" at the beginning of the previous sentence, but Strunk would slap my hand for that. It is a useless phrase that adds no value to the sentence.<br /><br />At work, we are constantly writing technical reports and proposals and I often reach for this book when I'm attempting to clean up my mental-fatigued ramblings. I should have had this book in my teaching years, and if I could go back, I'd pay for all of the books myself if it meant the kids would keep their copy for their personal collection.<br /><br />On a practical note, buy this book in addition to \\"The Little, Brown Handbook\\" by Fowler.

B000FA57N0|5.0|There are thousands of reviews about Serenity as a movie, so we'll keep this about the HD edition. <br /> <br />Extraordinary movie to watch on hd DVD. <br />Since it is one of our all time favorites Serenity was the first HD movie we watched on our new HD player. The sound was the first thing we noticed about this HD version of Serenity. Wow! It really made use of our sound system. <br /> The picture was awesome, there was so much detail to take in, breath taking. Really as good as watching it in the theater, and as enjoyable. <br /> <br /> We own the regular DVD of serenity and were very happy with it but after watching it on HD there is no question that we prefer the HD.  <br />We played the regular DVD of Serenity right after watching this one and the up processing of the player made the regular dvd looks better than ever  but the HD edition was still has much more detail and superior sound. <br /> <br />Some great extras, I think the regular DVD has all of the same features, but I could be wrong.  <br /> <br />We do wish they would have added a cast commentary for the movie. They all did a great job with commentaries for the DVD release of the Firefly <br />
B000OCXMAE|2.0|Wow, Linkin Park used to be one of our favorite bands....until this album came out!  What a disappointment!  It sounds nothing like LP and to be honest I'm not sure it sounds like anybody...and thats not a good thing! <br />I will give them another shot on their next album, but if it doesnt change then...See Ya LP! <br />P.S.  this is kind of like what happened to Pearl Jam, Stone Temple Pilots, Deftones, Sevendust...etc, bands get too comfortable and want to attempt to \\"CHANGE\\"...well I am afraid I know how this story is going to END!
B00005JPCF|4.0|This was a very enjoyable production.  The animation was excellent and the story line appealing.  It would be best to see this film on a large theater screen, but I still enjoyed it very much.
B000O75F7C|3.0|I have been a fan of Porcupine Tree for many years now. Like most people, I fell in love with this band after hearing \\"In Absentia,\\" which I still think is their best album, and one of the best albums of the last ten years in general. After collecting nearly all of their earlier material, I was completely hooked. Then \\"Deadwing\\" came out, and I was in ecstasy: it combined everything that was great about this band, and some of their most inspired and beautiful moments were contained on that album (\\"Scratching of the Mellotron\\" still gives me shivers from time to time). <br /> <br />That's why I'm so sad about \\"Fear of a Blank Planet.\\" When I listened to it through for the first time, I was astounded when I couldn't recall any standout moments. There was no hook from start to finish, and I felt slightly betrayed. After all, Porcupine Tree has established themselves as a band that is constantly surging forth, and this release seems like a step backwards. The only two songs on here that make this album worth the price are \\"My Ashes\\" and \\"Sentimental,\\" which is a shame, because they're the two shortest tracks on here. Simply beautiful, the both of them. I wish I could say the same for the rest of the album: <br /> <br />Track 1: Promising intro, until I realised that the song didn't really go anywhere from then on. This song is like a deflating tire. <br /> <br />Track 2: Beautiful ballad, and possibly one of my favorite \\"short songs\\" by Steve Wilson. Just perfectly composed throughout, and a breathtaking chorus complete with lush orchestrations. Could be the best song on here. <br /> <br />Track 3: The biggest disappointment of the album. When I heard Porcupine Tree was doing a 17 minute song, I was overjoyed, considering what they've managed to create in the past with much shorter songs. I was devastated as I listened to it, though, because instead of grabbing you and keeping you engaged from the get-go (like \\"arriving somehwere, but not here\\" does), this beast of a song just hangs over your head, not really going anywhere or doing anything. The only reason I kept listening was out of hope for it to suddenly change for the better, and make everything right. Alas, this did not happen. What's more, Gavin Harrison has managed to create absolutely no impression with his unimaginative drumming (something I never thought he could do). There's also some nu-metal rubbish that keeps popping up. There's some good bits in here, but not nearly enough to make these 17 depressing minutes worth it. <br /> <br />Track 4: The other good song on here. Very nice Beatles-ish piano composition with some haunting vocal melodies and soundscape work. Overall, the 2nd best song on here. Beautifully written and beautifully performed. <br /> <br />Track 5: Simply ok. Nothing terrible, nothing wonderful. Which is not what comes to mind when I think of Porcupine Tree. <br /> <br />Track 6: Don't even bother. Just try and salvage some good memories from the past 5 songs and take the CD out. I almost broke something when I heard this sludgy, uncreative slop coming out of a band I admire...but have lost respect for. <br /> <br />Porcupine Tree is still one of my favorite bands of all time. Every group has an album here or there that doesn't do much for some of its listeners, and if every album kept getting better than the last, where would it end? I hope very much that it doesn't end here for PT, and that this will go down in history as just a \\"bad spot.\\" Looking forward to the next release! <br /> <br />By the way, the new Blackfield album totally makes up for this one. Amazing stuff.
B000784WMW|4.0|I enjoyed this film, however he format is distracting.  The frequent breaks and credits of the masgterpiece theater production break the flow of the film.
0920668372|5.0|I have this book for about a year and a half and everytime I try to read it to my son (almost 4), I cry. I have never been able to read it out loud, to the end. <br />I need to go practice on my own, before my next attempt or he will think I'm cuckoo.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|I own a Nikon D50 and this is the perfect flash for me. I was looking for a simple, compact flash unit that would integrate with the Nikon TTL system, and this is it. The bounce flash feature is great...it allows for beautiful, softly-lit indoor photos/portraits, etc. This flash could not be easier to use. Just turn it on and shoot. If you forget to turn it off, that's ok...it'll turn itself off for you. The unit's small size allows me to just leave the flash mounted on my camera 90% of the time while the camera is stored in its gear bag. Also, I checked pricing before purchasing and Amazon offered the best, lowest price...even cheaper than the local warehouse club store's website, which usually is pretty good. Overall, this is an excellent flash for the average-to-avid hobbiest photographer who does not need the extra features, size and price of a more expensive, professional flash unit.
B000P0J02E|5.0|Definitely the best of all the Pirates soundtracks, Hans Zimmer outdoes himself, as always.  I've listened to this soundtrack about 12 times already...only got it a few days ago.  Each of the songs has a wonderful uniqueness and possesses its own quality.  While listening to each  you can imagine what is happening, whether or not you've yet to see the film.  An absolutely wonderful piece, all classical and Pirates fans must hear it.
B00003CXCD|5.0|This film is the sweetest, most lovable romantic film ever. This film encouraged my uncle to become a reporter!
0743455967|5.0|If you are serious about wanting to be a writer and learning how to discipline yourself, this is the book for you.  Sage advice on words to leave out and words to keep.  A keeper if there ever was one.  I loaned my first copy out and never got it back so I had to get another.  Well worth it.
0743243153|5.0|This book is about you/me and whether or not you want to work at being honest with your life.  If you are searching for yourself and just can't seem to find where you've been hiding Dr. Peck gives you a foundation to build a positive learning environment and an eyepiece to see yourself. <br />Definitely a library worthy read!
1582701709|5.0|The Secret is just good psychology.  I listen to parts of THe Secret during the week to make me stop and think, and to give me fuel for a meditation for the day.  The film is almost the same as the book and it is useful for reinforcement.  Some of the outtakes are really funny and also food for thought.  I think the DVD is a good purchase.
1572705329|4.0|Lively, vivid rendition of my favourite Jane Austen novel. Prunella Scales interprets the characters with great individuality and spirit.
0930289234|5.0|The Watchmen is one of the greatest works of graphic literature in all history. Dave Gibbons' artwork perfectly brings to life writer Alan Moore's (\\"From Hell\\", \\"League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\\" and many other works) writings to life.  Gibbons' style is highly realistic and the coloring is incredible.<br /><br />Each frame of art is a mini-masterpiece and helps add a visual dimension to Alan Moore's dark scrawlings.<br /><br />I bought Watchmen in its original monthly 12 issue format years ago.  The super-heroes here are similar to 1930's Golden Age heroes, a bit campy and wooden.  But Alan Moore heaps on the cynicism and darkness to update  his heroes.  One of the Watchmen is a rapist and war criminal.  Another is a revenge obssessed predator, born to a prostitute and traumatized by a horrific murder of a child.<br /><br />Moore expertly explores the moral corruption that accompanies total power.  Who watches the Watchmen?<br /><br />The movie version next year could be great.
B000654Z2I|4.0|Not as good as the two Albums that followed in my humble opinion. Gets a bit silly towards the end. You can feel they have lost focus. However it starts well.
B000OCXMAE|4.0|I downloaded this new album, Minutes to Midnight by Linkin Park and a I have to say that it is somewhat of a disappointment, especially considering how good Hybrid Theory and Meteora were. Here are some pros and cons <br /> <br />Pros <br />1. some song are like older albums, similar sound <br />2. chester still sounds great <br />3. most of the lyrics are very in depth and excellent <br />4. like brad delson's haistyle :) <br /> <br />Cons <br />1. need more of Mike Shinoda <br />2. Some songs are way too soft for Linkin Park <br />3. overuse of clapping in some songs <br /> <br />Even though that this is a good album overall and the guys at LP put a lot of effort into it but I think that they \\"changed the sound of the band\\" a little in the wrong direction. This album is definately not as good as the previous 2.
B00023B1LC|5.0|I don't know about this extended version, I saw the movie in the theater and then on pay per view several times. Great suspense, excellent fight scened, Matt Damon at his, in my opinion, best. Great editing and direction, this movie does not slow down and is one of my all time favorite action suspense flicks.
B000002G87|5.0|I bought these LP's, as an angst ridden, teenage girl. I'm now very settled and happy but I continue to love music. I have over a 1000 CD's (that are ripped of course) in the blues/rock/alternative genre and actively seek out new artists to add to my collection every year.     It occurred to me recently, that out of all the music I own, this is my favorite. I have listened to it countless times, yet it still moves me. So many other reviews have detailed what's so great about this music, that I won't repeat, but something magic happened during these sessions.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This series is all that is cracked up to be.  It is a wonderful way to see our world.
0374105235|5.0|This book is one of the best books that I have been blessed to read.  Ishmael takes you through every step of his days back in 1993 and you feel like you were actually there.  It's sad to know that these things are still going on in the same place that they occurred in years ago.  If anyone gets a chance to read this book, please do.  It will help you appreciatte the things that you have and don't have, the people in your life and you'll realize all of the blessings that you have obtained. <br />
0316018953|5.0|Anytime Michael Connelly has a new book out I immediately buy it knowing I will be reading another great book by one of the best writers out there today. \\"The Overlook\\" did not disappoint at all. Admittedly, I would have liked the book to be longer, but I realize that it was a compilation of chapters he had published in a New York Newspaper. Still, Harry Bosch is back (as is Rachel Walling) as a murder scene becomes more than just murder. Terrorists are involved, threats of terrorism, suspects from all directions,  FBI versus LAPD, and a great story line that will keep you guessing, go different directions and when it is all over you realize you've read a great book. I was constantly caught off guard by the twists and turns (which is the way it should always be with a great crime fiction book!) and when I finished the book the only regret I had was that I didn't have another Connelly book to pick up and start reading!     225 pages of Connelly at his best. Grab this book and enjoy a great read.
B000P0J02E|5.0|The song that played during the preview wasn't on the cd, was it? Does anyone know that name of it?
B00006EXCC|5.0|this is how a rolling stones album should sound;  no gimmicks just pure music
0316018953|5.0|Although this Harry Bosch outing is not as long as previous ones (and is priced accordingly,) I don't think that it is fair to characterize it as simply a short story, glorified or otherwise.  This has got real meat, the ins and outs, the back and forth conflict with the authority figures (in this case with the FBI) that one expects from Connelly's novels.<br /><br />The book is shorter because the pace is fast, the action takes place in the course of one day, and there is not as much exposition of the inner life of Bosch's mind.<br /><br />The tension with the FBI is handled artfully - even Harry's fans may wonder if he really is smarter than the best that the feds can offer, or, on the other hand, if his petulance and territoriality may not be creating some needless national security risks.<br /><br />One might have hoped to learn a little more about Bosch's interaction with his timid new partner, Ignacio (or is it \\"Iggy\\"?) Ferras, but only so much can develop in the course of one day. It looks like an interesting theme to develop in the next novel.<br /><br />All in all, it was a satisfying visit to Bosch's LA, but I just hope that it doesn't mean that we have to wait too long for another full length novel.
B0000A118M|4.0|For years my very good friend who prides himself on being a music aficionado and \\"snob\\", much like Jack Black's character in High Fidelity, has been raving about John Coltrane and a \\"Love Supreme\\". I however, have been firmly encamped in the classic rock, blues and pop of the 50's, 60's & 70's. I always felt the jazz style that Coltrane and others of that genre played, was way above my head. Though I appreciated the musicianship to the degree I could, I didn't particularly care for it. I didn't \\"get it\\". <br /> <br />But now as I reach the half-way point in my fifties, I wanted to force my self to listen and try to see just what it is about Coltrane that so many folks find extrodinary. So my friend recommended A Love Supreme. I listened and listened and virtually immersed my self in the recording until passages became familiar.  Now I have a glimmer, an embryonic appreciation of the man's gift. I put it on for my 17 year old daughter and she loves it! It grows on you and I think maybe for the first time I'm experiencing what that type of jazz can do for you.  Live & learn!
B00006CXSS|5.0|Was one of the best Movie/Mini Series I've ever seen.  I will probably watch it again this weekend due to Memorial Day.  But I've watched it 3 times already. You get caught up in the film and the history of the war.<br /><br />Tom Hanks and Steve Spielberg both did a great job with this movie.  I highly recommend getting the DVD set.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|Even though this is alot softer than your usual Linkin Park CD, it has a fresh feeling to it and sounds really nice. Here are the songs breakdown: <br />1. Wake - A slow intro that really is boring. 3/10 <br />2. Given Up - One of the most \\"old - sounding\\" songs on the CD. Great Chours and Bridge. 9/10 <br />3. Leave Out All The Rest - Great ballad that will be a radio hit. Tune is really nice and mellow. 10/10 <br />4. Bleed It Out - Another great rock song. Mike's rapping is fantastic. 10/10 <br />5. Shadow of the Day - A slow song, not much in it. Almost no tune, boring lyrics. 6/10 <br />6. What I've Done - A good first single. Kind of softer rock but the vocals are nice. 8/10 <br />7. Hands Held High - Mike's rapping solo. Great tune, powerful lyrics. 10/10 <br />8. No More Sorrow - This really sounds like the old albums.'Nough said. 10/10 <br />9. Valentine's Day - A slow, mellow song. Kinda emo and depressing. 6/10 <br />10. In Between - Unlike most people, this is my favorite song! Mike's singing is really good and I like the chours tune. 10/10 <br />11. In Pieces - Chester's version of In Between. More Lively Tune 10/10 <br />12. Title Too Long - Takes too long to get interesting. 5/10 <br /> <br />This is a great album but if you're looking for the old Linkin Park sound you'll be really,really dissapointed. It's a good album in it's own right, and it's so different it's hard to classify it a linkin park album
B000NVIXFK|3.0|I am a 27 year fan of Rush.  It is amazing that they are still blowing the doors off.  This is a fine album and it does deviate slightly from most things they have done in the last 33 years.  However, it still does not grab me with anything out of the ordinary. <br /> <br />Many have stated that they should not, or should, go back to their \\"old stuff\\".  Well, truthfully speaking, Rush has basically been doing the same thing for 14 years. So, they have been doing something on par with their \\"old stuff\\". Just 14 years old. <br /> <br />If you took half of \\"Roll The Bones\\", all of \\"Counterparts\\", \\"Test For Echo\\", \\"Vapor Trails\\", \\"Snakes & Arrows\\" and played them randomly, I would not be able to tell which song came from which album if I did not know the albums (notwithstanding the production). I might be able to tell the difference from the S&A songs because of the acoustic guitar throughout. Other than that... <br /> <br />Every album from their first to about \\"Presto\\" you could tell which song came from which album by how the song was orchestrated and structured. They all sound different. Maybe there was not much of break in sound and song structuring between A Farewell To Kings and Hemispheres, or Power Windows and Hold Your Fire, but otherwise there are stark differences. <br /> <br />If they did find themselves inspired to write material akin to the first decade of their career, it might actually just sound a bit new and refreshing.
B00002ZMNV|5.0|This is the best concert DVD I have ever seen by far. It is of amazing sound and visual quality with many extra features. The documentary on the making of S&M is very interesting and cool to watch. If you love Metallica as much as I do, then you'll love this DVD.
0743289684|5.0|What a courageous woman.  I have often wondered why those women who suffer the most under \\"religious\\" practices do not speak out.  Finally, we have such a woman..who must now have her life guarded by doing so.  Incredible, moving story of a brave, clear-headed life.
B00008G8QV|2.0|When the product description states \\"Each riff and solo is played up to speed\\", my expectation was that each riff and solo of these songs is examined in their entirety on this CD.  My expectations were FAR from met.  On most of the songs, only the intro riff and perhaps a mid-song riff is explained.  I have only watched about 1/3 of the DVD so far, but none of the solos have been shown yet.  This DVD will only be satisfying to the utmost beginner that is not interested in playing whole songs.  I wish I could get my money back.<br /><br />To further infuriate me, this (and every Hal Leonard or Cherry Lane DVD I own) will not play on my home computer's DVD drive.  I've contacted customer service and they have not replied or tried to help.  All other DVDs I own will play in this drive.  The DVDs will play in my home theater's DVD player, though.<br /><br />For the record, the other Hal Leonard and Cherry Lane DVD's I own are:<br />> Metallica: Guitar Legendary Licks 1983-1988 (Cherry Lane/Hal Leonard)<br />> Metallica: Guitar Legendary Licks 1988-1997 (Cherry Lane/Hal Leonard)<br />> The Best of the Allman Brothers Band: Guitar Signature Licks (Hal Leonard)
B000MNP2KI|5.0|One of the best of the Bond series. More like the originals rather than the junked up later ones.
0807126063|4.0|This book deserves its cult status as an off-kilter comic masterpiece. John Kennedy Toole surely nailed the unique cultural quirks of the back streets of New Orleans and its eccentric denizens. Toole's comic plotline is brilliantly written, as the personalities that have the misfortune to be associated with the self-obsessed and obnoxious Ignatius J. Reilly all come together in a hilarious comedy of errors. There is also a subtle undercurrent of melancholy here, particularly regarding the travails faced by Ignatius' long-suffering mother. Toole's characters are uniformly fascinating and unique, though I must dock the novel one star because I totally can't stand Ignatius as a person, albeit a fictional one. Perhaps that was Toole's intention, but Ignatius really stretches the boundaries of believability at times. Thus, it's difficult to determine whether the reader is meant to cheer Ignatius on in his delusional eccentricities, or to curse him for insulting and degrading everyone around him. (I'll leave it to the English professors to decide if that's the sign of a truly well-constructed character.) I was also a bit dissatisfied with Ignatius's fate and comeuppance at the end of the novel - his overbearing self deserved either way less or way more. Regardless, this novel is definitely funny throughout, and quite poignant at times, while documenting a unique culture and its even more unique characters. John Kennedy Toole deserves to be remembered as a writer of great skill, and we can wonder what could have been. [~doomsdayer520~]
078322611X|5.0|In my opinion Ray Liotta gave the best performance in this wonderful ensemble of talent.  His natural delivery and boyish earnestness gave Field of Dreams a quality rarely seen in cinema today.  His performance harked back to Cary Cooper or Jimmy Stewart of the 1930's.   <br /> <br />In a magnificently well-written role, Academy Award winner Burt Lancaster, in the twilight of his career, shows why he became a film legend and remained one for almost six decades.
0743270754|4.0|The first third of the book is slow, as we are subject to a biographical sketch of the upbrining of Lincoln, Salmon Chase, William Seward, and Edward Bates.  This is referred to periodically by Goodwin in drawing parallels between their political positions and their personal lives, so it is an important part of the book.  Nevertheless, I will admit that the spartan upbringing of Salmon Chase has never been of particular interest to me. <br /> <br />The book picks up with the 1860 campaign as the focus switches much more on Lincoln.  Goodwin provides a good bit of information I'd not been aware of with regards to how Lincoln organized the political aspect of his presidency, balancing the needs of the various factions in order to be able to maintain support for his candidacy and ultimately for the war once he'd won. This is a somehwat different perspective than most Lincoln books and it made for some enlightening reading. <br /> <br />My only complaint is that Goodwin's tendancy to have paragraphs like \\"Lincoln's long time support for a universally disliked failing policy ultimately gave him the opportunity to change direction and obtain universal support, another example of his pure genius.\\"  I think sometimes Lincoln was just wrong, and sometimes stubbornly so but Goodwin would have us beleive that it is all part of the master plan.  That I think goes too far.  But overlooking a bit of fawning on her part, I have enjoyed this book and learned some new things.
B00000JXVK|5.0|I first saw this documentary back in 1970 when I was an active morotcycle rider myself.  It was great.  Covers all aspects of motorcycle competion in an often humorous way including some events that the average bike rider probably has not thought of.  I don't ride motorcycles any more but On Any Sunday [[ASIN:B00000JXVK On Any Sunday]] is just as good today as it was back then.  I consider it a must for all motorcycle fans and wantabees.
B000HLDFM2|5.0|Based on Garon Tsuchiya's manga, Oldboy is about Oh Dae-su, an ordinary salaryman type, who is held at a police station for being drunk.  Afterwards, he is kidnapped, locked up in a hotel-like room without windows, gassed repeatedly so the room is cleaned and so  he can get a haircut and clean clothes, and kept there for 15 years.  \\"If they had told me then that it would be fifteen years, would it have been easier to endure....or harder?\\"  His only contact to the outside world is the TV.  \\"It's both a clock and a calendar. It's your school, your home, your church, your friend... and your lover<br /><br />It's after being let out and into \\"life in a bigger prison\\" that Oh Dae-su's quest really begins.  Who imprisoned him and why?  He is given a cell-phone and a wallet full of money by a scraggly bum, then goes to a sushi restaurant where he meets Mido, a beautiful young woman who takes pity on him and takes him back to her place when he collapses.  It also appears he has been hypnotized during his imprisonment--but why?  His nemesis, a man later identified as Lee Woo-Jin, is quite the mastermind.  When they first confront each other, Lee gives him five days to find out the truth, or he will kill Mido.  If Oh Dae-su wins, Lee promises to kill himself.<br /><br />Through clues of finding out which Chinese restaurant provided him with the same potstickers he ate for 15 years, he finds Mr. Park, the owner of the hotel where he was imprisoned.  It is here that two memorable scenes occur, one a tooth torture scene where he extracts Mr. Park's teeth out with a hammer, all set to Vivaldi's \\"Winter\\" section of the Four Seasons.  Using such music in such a scene adds a bit of humor in it.  He then takes on a handful of Park's thugs armed only with a hammer, his fists, and keeps on fighting even though a knife is plunged into his back.  The sardonic smile on his face when he encounters an elevator full of thugs is priceless.  Guess what happens to them?<br /><br />The theme of revenge and Lee Woo-jin's attitude, \\"Whether it is a grain of sand or a rock, in water they both sink alike\\" implies that no sin is too small for revenge.  He later tells Oh Dae-su, \\"Seeking revenge is the best cure for someone who has been hurt.  Try it. ... Once again, revenge is good for your health.\\"  But to quote Hamlet, aye, there's the rub.  \\"But what happens after you've had your revenge?  I bet that hidden pain probably emerges again.\\"  The whole point is that this isn't about Oh Dae-Su's revenge on Lee Woo-Jin, but vice-versa.  As someone who holds grudges easily, I can easily relate to what Lee says.<br /><br />Oh Dae-Su's introspection in seeing who it was he had offended reveals that every life is far from perfect.  \\"Study your whole lifetime,\\" he is told by Lee.  But he also realizes that his imprisonment has changed him, as he figures Mido wouldn't like him the way he was before imprisonment.  But there is hope for redemption, as seen in the scene with snow, symbolizing a clean new start.<br /><br />This was actually the second film I'd seen with Choi Min-sik, the first being Shiri, but so far, this is his master performance, a creditable and credible performance as Oh Dae-Su.  He later appears as the villainous Mr. Baek in Lady Vengeance.  Yu Ji-Tae scores well as the devilish but weak Lee Woo-Jin, and has a cameo in LV.  Ditto for Kang Hye-jeong as the cute-as-a-button Mido.  She is a TV reporter in LV.  And Oh Dal-Su (Mr. Park) plays the bakery owner Mr. Chang in LV.<br /><br />The movie's score is another triumph.  Whether it is the upbeat techno beat of the opening shot of Oh Dae-su grabbing onto the suicidal man's tie, the haunting quiet ambience during Oh's fight with Han in Lee Wu-Jin's penthouse, the Godfather-like waltz that is Lee Woo-Jin's theme, and Mido's sad theme with clarinet and strings, the music team scored a big triumph.<br /><br />This is hailed as the best in Park Chan-Wook's trilogy in story-telling, film-making, acting, and techniques.  One of the best films I've seen in awhile.
B0002FR07O|3.0|Steven Wilson never sits still. \\"Signify\\" is a move in a pleasant direction. There's still some of the atmospheric stuff that marked earlier works such as \\"The Sky Moves Sideways\\" and \\"Up the Downstair\\" but there are also slightly more upbeat -- musically if not lyrically -- ballads. \\"Sever,\\" not written by Wilson, is one of the highlights in my opinion. \\"Dark Matter,\\" the moody closer to disk one, is another of the best song. The bonus CD contains demos and unreleased stuff. Among the most enjoyable is the acoustic version of \\"Nine Cats.\\" You could sing along to it with your kids without a worry.
B000062X9B|5.0|This 3rd album in the 'American' series of recordings is amongst the best things Johnny Cash has ever done. As with all the late Cash recordings there is a running thread of passionate honesty and realism that runs throughout the entire the album.<br /><br />Typical of this is the opening track \\"I Won't Back Down\\". Cash is defiant on this track: \\"Well I know whats right, I got just one life, in a world that keeps on pushing me around, but I stand my ground and I won't back down\\". This track like the rest is stripped down to a bare minimum. Accoustic guitar with some extra backing vocals on the chorus is all you get, and of because of Cash's fantastic lived in voice, this works to perfection.<br /><br />Its Cash's voice and the sparse arrangements on this album that make all the covers sound like they were written for him. Neil Diamonds \\"Solitary Man\\" and U2's \\"One\\" being perhaps the best examples of this. However the best track full stop is Cash's great cover of Nick Caves \\"The Mercy Seat\\". Here Cash again restates the running theme through his final albums \\"I am not afraid die\\". Full credit to producer Rick Rubin for the arrangement on this track which adds to the already powerful lyric.<br /><br />I've only just purchased this and I haven't stopped playing it.
B000NVIXFK|4.0|As a long-time Rush fan, I followed along with all the pre-album hype like everyone else. I certainly noted comments made by the producer regarding this body of work. There were many comments regarding how it sounded like \\"old Rush\\". So, I began listening to this with that bias. <br /> <br />Let me say first, that this is their best, most consistent body of work in many years. From Far Cry, through the middle portions, and out the other end, it is enjoyable and enticing. <br /> <br />What it is not is the \\"same old Rush\\", which is both good and not so good. There were some critics that gave little credence to the covers album \\"Feedback\\". However, if you listen to Test for Echo and Vapor Trails and then listen to this, you will unmistakably hear the fact that, musically, Rush has \\"recalibrated\\" their music to some of those old classics presented so well on Feedback. That change is most notable in the frequent, sometimes prominent, and much welcomed use of accoustic guitars throughout most of the songs. This gives the entire album a more organic feel and does tend to allow one to harken back to Rush's work from the '70s, while still being truly new and original music. Hopefully, this is an indication that they have, again, shifted their musical direction. <br /> <br />What is not as enjoyable is the direction Neal has taken with the lyrics. Again, if you connect the dots through the last three or four studio albums, you will not be surprised to find that his humanistic views have become much more prominant. In the past, that was fine because they were often written as a point of discussion, rather than a point of \\"fact\\". You could consider it, take it or leave it, and still enjoy the musical experience. On a couple of songs on this album, especially \\"Faithless\\", he is beginning to write more as the \\"high priest\\" of the \\"great\\" Humanist church. The lyrics tend to be just as preachy as some over-the-top gospel music has been noted for. Unfortunately, it becomes prominant enough as to detract from an otherwise musically enjoyable song, unless, of course, you agree with his point of view. However, one thing that always made Rush, Rush, was the ability to think about and consider the stories and morals being offered up without having to buy into them. Some of that is lost with the lyrical direction taken on this album. <br /> <br />Beyond that, the subject matter is war and religion primarily. Considering their general view on these topics, the lyrics do tend to apply a somewhat dark, overreaching tenor to the album. However, in general, that seems to add rather than detract from the album. <br /> <br />Another welcome \\"return\\" to \\"older\\" Rush is the return of the instrumental absent from Vapor Trails. This album has three great pieces. In fact, the album reaches its peak as you pass through the first instrumental, The Main Monkey Business, ride through the wonderfully diverse song The Way the Wind Blows, and then hit the second instrumental, Hope. The Main Monkey Business may be the best song on this album. In fact, overall, it is, if not their best instrumental, amoung the top 3. (Maybe this one will finally pull down the long-overdue Grammy award?) Hope is a nice 12-string accoustic guitar piece that helps remind one of 1) just how good Alex is on guitar and 2) just how good a Rush concert really is. <br /> <br />The bottom line, this is a great album. Not perfect, but a definite step up from their more recent efforts and far and away better than most other new music on the scene these days. Musically, I continue to be convinced that you will not find any band who is more consistently good at both the writting and playing than Rush. This album reinforces that view. You will thoroughly enjoy the instrumentals, along with songs like The Way the Wind Blows, and the most of the others. <br /> <br />Lyrically, I don't feel it is as good as some of their writing in the past (Counterparts and Roll the Bones, for example), but it is stillgood. <br /> <br />
B000002GWN|5.0|This live set from 1974 captures Joni Mitchell with the L.A. Express performing some of her best material up to that time.<br /><br />Joni is in scintillating form. Her voice at this time was as good as it ever got, and that means you're listening to one of the most flexible female voices in the history of rock music. You'll have no doubt about this when you hear a track like \\"All I Want\\". The pitch and control of dynamics she gets from her voice on this track are simply amazing.<br /><br />The band are also tremendous. Listen to the rocking version of Big Yellow Taxi with Tom Scotts fabulous solo. This band also hints at the move towards the Jazz arena that Joni would move towards in the next few years. Robben Ford is on guitar who would later play with Miles of Davis. Contrary to a previous reviewer I found the group to be first class.<br /><br />There quite a few tracks from Blue, plus many other well known songs such as \\"Woodstock\\", \\"Jericho\\" and a moving version of \\"Both Sides Now\\". This is a little heard treasure of an album thats essential for anybody who wants to hear Joni at her absolute best.
B00000612P|5.0|Gene Santoro wrote that Rod's lyrics were \\"almost offhand, conversational, the kind of rambling talk you might overhear at the table in a bar.\\" That was this album - a good friend, talking to you over (maybe slightly too many) drinks. Folkie melancholy, rockin' and rollin' - with this album you were hanging with a bud. Rod was alternative when this was released - he had instruments that no one else was using, the songs were different, the mood was congenial. Why Rod can't do something like this again, from a different perspective, is still something I can't figure out.
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|It has taken two years for me to bring myself to see this movie. On first viewing it, I picked it to pieces and was quite upset, being a purist, but something about it got to me.  By the third viewing I had fallen in love with it, much to my surprise.  Everyone keeps referring to the BBC version starring Colin Firth, but that is the A&E version, which also took some liberties.  The definitive Pride and Prejudice was done by the BBC in 1980 and stars David Rintoul.  He IS Mr. Darcy and that version is completely faithful to the book.  If you have never seen, you must.
B000MV9026|3.0|I thought this would be a family movie, but it's pretty dark in some places.<br /><br />I am still not sure what the humans in the movie were doing to hurt the penguins. Something about nets, I take it. It's a sloppy mess of environmental accusations that are never made clear.<br /><br />On the plus side, the animation was, for me, jaw-droppingly good, as was Savion Glover's work on the dance scenes. The revelation for me was Brittany Murphy, whom I've liked since she played Tai in \\"Clueless.\\" She can actually sing! Best voice of the film, speaking or singing.<br /><br />So if you don't mind a murky \\"green\\"-ish message but love to watch good animation, check out \\"Happy Feet.\\"
B000F7CMQ8|3.0|Having rented this movie only for Ava Gardner and not for the plot, I knew it was going to be cheesy from the beginning. It's a non-musical produced by MGM, what can one expect? This is one of those old kinds of movies where the character development takes a backseat to the *breathtaking* scenery and atmosphere. Actually the scenery isn't so breathtaking (maybe in 1953 this would have blown your socks off, but come on, those of us in 2007 are much more world weary now). As usual, Ava and Grace flounce around the jungle in well decked out outfits and perfectly applied lipstick. This kind of reminded me a bit of 1954's \\"Elephant Walk\\" with Elizabeth Taylor: both movies are over the top melodramatic with special effects that are extremely lame by today's standards. The focus on scenery, costumes, shooting on location, and special effects causes the character development to suffer. Honestly, \\"Mogambo\\" gets a bit boring at times with all of its scenery shots. I think \\"Elephant Walk\\" had more of an interesting story, and that's not saying much. I'm puzzled as to why Ava and Grace were nominated Oscars for this movie. I love these two actresses, but \\"Mogambo\\" is a throw away filler movie Ava made (sadly like much of her career) and for Grace is was just something she needed to allow her new film career to take flight. Oh and Clark Gable in this? He seems tired, bored, and worn out. Not to mention he's way too old! The studio's decision to recast him in the same beefcake role 21 years later (which would never have happened for a woman) just highlights the strong double standards that existed in old Hollywood for men and women.
B00004X01U|5.0|this album is fun and well done - anyone who likes Madonna should have this in his/her collection.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Quite possibly the greatest nature doc I have ever seen.  If you have the ability to play either HD version of this series you should do yourself a favor and buy it.
B000OCXFCO|1.0|This review is coming from an EX-Megadeth fan.<br /><br />Like most people here, Megadeth was a gateway band way back in Elementary school. Rust in Peace, Peace Sells..., and Countdown to Extinction recieved heavy rotation throughout my CD player for a long, long time. So, it pains me to say that Megadeth have finally sold out. Yes, I should have seen it coming when they wrote Gears of War for that terrible, over-rated cheese fest of a game, but I calmly ignored it. Then, I heard A Tout Le Monde with Christina Scabbia in it. I again ignored the signals. But then, I bought it, and to my dismay, I was horrified.<br /><br />Kind of funny considering how Dave thrived on the fact that Megadeth never sold out like $elloutica did.
B00006JQU1|5.0|There is little I can add to the glowing reviews already posted. I think Rachael Podger a very fine fiddler and I own a number of her recordings. <br />Here I feel that she plays Bach with love and a deep affection, it is much more than a demonstration of technical ability. I have never been able to get that feeling with Grumiaux's version which I find harsh and mechanical, whereas I find his playing of Mozart, Beethoven and Schubert, in particular their chamber music, excellent. Ms Podger and her baroque violin are superb; 5 stars.
B000N3ST9I|1.0|Yes, another trend band! Wo hoo, now we can add them to such great classic scenester groups as Papa Roach, Green Day, Devildriver and other such money-grubbing scum! If you want a band that went from playing fake, watered down thrash to vapid nu-metal and then talentless trendy metalcore, look no further!<br /><br />Recommended to fans of Trivium, Hellyeah, Atreyu, and other such great, talented bands!
B000N4SHPS|5.0|When I first saw \\"Rocky Balboa\\" it was mainly because my wife wanted to see it, and I had no idea what to expect. I loved it so much I rented the first five films and then watched the sixth installment again just so I could appreciate it even more! <br />What's nice about this film is that Rocky finally seems mortal...now a widower, he lives alone in the same Philadelphia neighborhood where he started, and he owns a successful restaurent called \\"Adrians\\". Although he is still popular, it is more subdued and respectful now; we no longer have enthusiastic crowds following him around, but rather individual people paying their respects. His son Robert is living and working on his own, and although he loves his father he can't help but feel resentful of the fact that most people see him only as Rocky's son and not as his own man. Rocky also develops a friendship with a woman named Marie, the same \\"little Marie\\" that he walked home in the first film. What's nice about their relationship is that it's not romantic in nature; rather, each one has a void in their lives that they help each other to fill. What's also touching is that Rocky still cares for Adrian even though she's gone, as he regularly visits her grave and also makes an annual visit to all the places that remind him of her, such as his old apartment, the pet shop where she used to work and the ice skating rink (now torn down) where they went on their first date. It is during this moments, which are combined with black-and-white flashback scenes, that we really get a sense of Rocky's mortality, as he sadly looks at the old sign of Mickey's gym and says to Paulie \\"The sign's falling apart\\" to which Paulie replies \\"Everything's falling apart!\\" (Paulie, by the way, has hardly changed a bit). <br />What's especially refreshing in this film is that we get to see the other side of a Rocky opponent. In this case it is Mason Dixon, excellently played by Antonio Tarver. Dixon is struggling with the fact that even though he is the champ, people hate him because he wins his fights too easily. Like Rocky, he also takes a step back into his past when he ditches his high-priced training team for his old trainer Martin, with the obvious reference here to Mickey.  <br />The training sequence for this film pays homage to the first three films, complete with \\"Gonna Fly Now\\" and Rocky running up the steps of the Philadelphia art musuem. The fight at the end is another classic, as we see Rocky trying to do the same thing he did in the first film; go the distance with the champ. Stallone and Tarver put on an excellent bout, complete with the HBO pay-per-view broadcast team that makes you feel that this really is a heavyweight fight. <br />Overall, this is just a great film, one that truly pays tribute to Rocky's past and ends this series on a high note. Every fan who felt that \\"Rocky V\\" was a sloppy and unfitting way for Rocky to go out should be more than pleased with this one.

0060007737|5.0|I must say I have become somewhat of a Ries groupie. Al & Laura Ries along with Jack Trout have created some of the most thought filled pieces within the Branding, Marketing and communications world today.  This one lives up the all the hype.  The 22 Immutable Laws of Branding is a masterpiece to say the least. I began seeking out new books on the topic and thought why not hear from the gurus of the field. I had read The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing first and it lead me to this great piece. I am a marketing student not just in the classroom but for life. It is what I do, therefore learning more is what I must do.   <br /> <br />Once you began your journey for more knowlege on Branding and relating fields you will side with this book.  Branding lives with the perpection that is placed int he mind of the consumer. In all my many marketing classes have I not discussed the many issues that come up in this book. To be a great marketer or branding strategiest you must seek out information from all levels of the field and then rethink those thoughts in regards to your position and situation.  This book places you in the right mindset to do that and much more. So begin the process...
B000FL7CAK|5.0|This show is intelligent, funny, and suspenseful. It is without a doubt  the most original show on television today (and hopefully will continue  to be if the CW doesn't cancel it). In an age of television where we  are inundated by crime and medical dramas and frivolous teen soap  operas, nothing holds a candle to Veronica Mars. The writing is  excellent and the acting is even better. Kristen Bell is superb as a  tough and spunky, but still human, leading lady. Her supporting cast is  excellent (Enrico Colantoni, Percy Daggs III, Jason Dohring, Tina  Majorino) and the frequent guest stars range from highly credited  actors like Paul Rudd, Harry Hamlin, Steve Guttenberg, Sydney Tamiia  Poitier, Ed Begley Jr., Lisa Rinna, and Alyson Hannigan to talented  unknowns. The story lines are excellent and completely unpredictable.  As you can tell, I can't say enough about it. But you don't have to  take my word for it...    PopMatters \\"Equal parts intrigue, drama, and humor, Veronica Mars is  also a lesson book for the disenfranchised. Few TV series aim so high;  even fewer succeed so well.\\"[22]     Kevin Smith \\"[Veronica Mars] is, hands-down, the best show on  television right now, and proof that TV can be far better than  cinema.\\"[25]     Stephen King \\"Nancy Drew meets Philip Marlowe, and the result is pure  nitro.\\"[26] \\"[Why is Veronica Mars so good? It bears little resemblance  to life as I know it, but I can't take my eyes off the damn thing.\\"[27]     Time magazine \\"One of the 6 best dramas on TV.\\"[23]     (If you love this show and want it to survive cancellation check out  the message boards in the \\"CW Lounge\\" on[..])
B00070DK1E|4.0|I've always enjoyed this 'album' as being Jethro Tull in a different sound. Tull is my all time favorite group, partially because of their versatility.
0300108834|5.0|I used this book in a history methods class.  We had to rewrite the chapters using the methods we learned in the class.  It was a lot of fun.  Gombrich explains history in his book in simple language for young readers; it was also fun to read it from an adult's point of view.  This book is a good starting point for anyone interested in learning history.
B000KX0IOK|4.0|Ryan Gosling was justly praised for his fine delineation of a dynamic and committed inner city school teacher whose private life is spinning out of control due to his losing struggle with cocaine and crack.  It is fine and subtle work and he conveys paragraphs of dialogue with a self-deprecating smile and hopeless exchange of looks with a caring and adoring student, beautifully played by Shareeka Epps, who has stumbled onto the facts of her inspiring teacher's contradictory sordid private life.    The film generates the same frustrating emotions while waiting for Gosling's Dan to make one more stupid decision, one more self-destructive act, that anyone has felt if they've ever had to deal with someone with an addiction problem.  The film gets that right, without being pedantic or preachy.      We don't get to the source of Dan's anger, despair, or whatever his demons may be, and that is just as well because it really doesn't matter.  What the film does illustrate is that addictive drugs can addict anyone, even smart and caring people, because they're addictive.  There doesn't have to be any other reason.     We see an old girlfriend who has cleaned-up and is about to marry someone else, and we can but hope that Dan, despite his avowed rejection of rehab for himself, will eventually find his way back, and the movie ends with a hope, but not a declaration.  Fittingly.     In general, I dislike a lot of hand-held camera work; but, I realize that a film like this wouldn't be made without some budget restrictions and it would require its use.  It does lend some intimacy, and besides, a film like this is all about the characters and acting, not where the camera is at any given moment.  Worthwhile.
0143038419|5.0|a brilliant story of a woman's search for balance and passion. I bought it in the airport and didn't care that my flight was delayed two hours because I was able to read it until I was forced by outside circumstances to put it down. If you like to travel, are spiritual, and like Italian food, read this book. You'll feel like you made a new friend.
0618551050|5.0|I am a doctor, but I also have very much interest in mathematics and physics, especially about the history. I remember I have already bought a book about string theory about 2 years ago, and already found that the writer is too arrogant and I considered him \\" mad'after finishing reading the whole book!!  I do not want to comment about the physics part as this would be discussed by those true \\" physicists \\". I just want discuss one thing  that this book raise out reflecting the current thinking in our world. That is , you cannot be humble and hard working does not always pay you off. Take my career, I am basically a clinician and my duty is to see patients everyday and try to help as much  patients as possible. But there is no use!! Because the more patients you saw, the more likely you would make mistakes,  the more chance you would meet unreasonable patients and unreasonale relatives and you would recieve more complaints!!! On the contrary , for those doctors who just seeing a few patients, publishing a lot of papers, appears in television frequently  they get the most benefits. Especially when they go to private practice, they have tremendous advantage!!! the layman would not know who are the good and the bad ones!! In their mind they would think those doctors who always appear in the television must be good and authorative in this aspect. Far from truth, I tell you.  <br />For those people who has serious medical problem and want to seek an advice from a doctor, either private or government, I think the best way is to ask an opinion from another doctor they trust and ask whether  the doctor they intend to seek advice is reliable  , because  only within our circle, we know which one is good and caring and which one is just knowing publishing papers but not know much how to treat a patient!!!

I strongly recommend it for anyone that is curious about the many disparities that we see and have always seen in our world.

B000O174CM|4.0|People acted so shocked when DREAMGIRLS was not nominated for best film at the Oscars.  Well, it didn't deserve it.<br /><br />I saw the original Broadway cast and it was an amazing experience - so much more than had been managed on Broadway before.  It was excellent even without the showstopper song.  The music told the story more than the acting.<br /><br />In the movie, the music lost all the intensity it had on stage.  They wanted names - Beyonce, Jamie Foxx - fine, but their acting and vocals didn't bring the emotional impact of the originals.<br /><br />The only character that did was Effie.  Ms. Jennifer Hudson didn't try to copy Jennifer Holliday - who could.  She made it her own.  Her acting was the most believable in the film and when she sang - she SANG.  That girl spoke more emotion through the songs than all the other actors did throughout the entire film.  Her Oscar was mor than deserved and not only for AND I AM TELLING YOU.<br /><br />Otherwise, the adaption was a mess.  When thet sang the song FAMILY and then Jennifer and Jamie went outside arguing they were in the middle of the riots complete with gunshots.  How unrealistic.  if all this was happening outside would they have all just been sitting in the theatre.<br /><br />And on the stage, when the song DREAMGIRLS was performed, as the group transitioned, it was magical. You were lost in it.  It was such a let down in the film.  The vocals didn't make it soar and even the shooting, editing of it certainly lost an opportunity to shine.<br /><br />For me, this movie made me wish the stage magic could have been brought to film.  It was e reminder of a memory.  Beyonce was stiff and some of the worst acting by Jamie so far.<br /><br />I would give this film 3 stars as an ill fated attempt but Jennifer Hudson made the material shine and anyone who had a scene with her looked better.  When she sang you wanted to stand, clap and shout as if you were seeing it live.  Jennifer Hudson - for you - I AM TELLING YOU - I have to give the film 4 stars. You deserve a career with much opportunities.<br /><br />Jennifer - your beautiful, emotional voice has certainly touched me and made this film something I will watch over and over, just for you.for you - I AM TELLING YOU - I have to give the film 4 stars.

0671027344|5.0|I read this 4 years ago at 19. It was read to moonlight and flashlight, curled in a sleeping bag. I still remember those few hours fondly. <br /> <br />Charlie is an instantaneously likable character writing to an anonymous never-present benefactor. \\"I am writing you because she said you listen and understand and didn't try and sleep with that person at that party even though you could have.\\" Off Charlie goes. A gentle, codependent high-schooler confessing on a spectrum of issues from an unrequited crush to homophobia to fighting parents to a sad sister to a jock brother to his English teacher who ladles out assignments like a soup nazi. Underneath and above and through it all throbs a shy, tentative voice coming into his own.  <br /> <br />The results have that special oomph which only comes with true talent. This is a beautiful, soulful, emotional piece. Buy it for your son, your daughter, AND yourself. It's that good.
B00005S770|5.0|What the? I thought rainbows were supposed to be quiet beautiful things. Well according to this album, rainbows are WILD, HEAVY METAL things!  <br /> <br />Whereas Rainbow's debut album was more about carrying on with the Machine Head-period of Deep Purple, the follow up is almost exactly the opposite- now we're walking dangerously close to heavy metal territory. It seems like every song is extemely fast, and much heavier now. Rainbow Rising doesn't feel like a classic rock/hard rock record- it feels like a straight up \\"take no bs\\" speed metal album.  <br /> <br />That's pretty much the story for the entire thing. Was this the absolute high point for the band? Maybe, but I better check out some of the bands live work before carving my thoughts into stone. I know one thing, \\"Stargazer\\" may be the coolest rock song I've ever heard. The vocals from Dio really make it even better, the way he almost sounds like he's pleading for help at the end, and the overall magical journey aspect of the song... and the unusually chaotic production really makes this song a highlight, in my book.  <br /> <br />The whole album is a winner, in fact. Get it now.  <br />
B000O174CM|3.0|I am not a person who likes musicals. The sight of people breaking into song mid-sentence annoys me to no end, and the very idea that people would talk to each other in verse is ridiculous. That being said, I wanted to see this movie because I'm a Jennifer Hudson fan and I wanted to see what all the talk was about. I'm glad that I did. Dreamgirls isn't a cheesy musical. There is no moment when the people are doing something absolutely ridiculous but it's justified because they're singing at the same time. In fact, the singing supports the story rather than the story supporting the singing, which is the main problem I have with musicals. Dreamgirls was enjoyable from start to finish, and I'd encourage those who don't consider themselves musical fans to give it a go.
0316113077|5.0|I was immediately surprised at the amount of information- the book is huge.  The author is dedicated to teaching the techniques that result in her beautiful, creative, and high quality culinary works of art.  She generously provides insider tips, which is in contrast to a lot of similar books where you get the feeling the author would rather keep the tips/techniques a secret!!  This is full of stunning photos, ideas, and advice.  Must-have.  The author has obviously put forth her best effort for a quality publication.
0792164903|4.0|1999's \\"Sleepy Hollow\\" is director Tim Burton's surprisingly entertaining reimagining of the classic Washington Irving ghost story.  Johnny Depp steals the movie as a very different Ichabod Crane.  Instead of a school teacher, Crane in this version is a New York City police constable experimenting with new-fangled forensic techniques, who is exiled to Sleepy Hollow by an unhappy magistrate (Christopher Lee in a spot-on cameo).  Crane arrives in Sleepy Hollow (authentically portrayed as a post-Revolutionary War farming community) to find a string of murders attributed to the headless corpse of a feared Hessian soldier.<br /><br />Crane gamely takes on the case, although it is unclear whether he is pursuing a ghost or a human with a more physical presence.  He gets help from Katrina Van Tassel (a well-cast Christina Ricci), who has some secrets of her own.  The movie features a very solid supporting cast.<br /><br />Burton lays on an escalating series of horrible murders, each with supernatural overtones, that challenge Crane's investigative techniques and rational beliefs.  As it turns out, a genuine horror has been unleashed in Sleepy Hollow.  Crane will have to deal with his own long suppressed memories of childhood witchcraft to save the innocent and punish the guilty.<br /><br />\\"Sleepy Hollow\\" is an off-beat but entertaining update to a classic story, recommended to those looking for something different in a Halloween movie.
B000AP04FG|3.0|Overall, the film was a good action movie for me. It was comical too, and I can't say that it's not enjoyable. However, my only thought is that there are waaay too many unnecessary deaths depicted in this movie.<br /><br />I know that that's how movies are now nowadays and I'm not at all against it, but good action flicks usually justify a sub-character's death; this film doesn't feel like it does. The fact that the traditional action-flick henchmen are replaced by government agents (who are probably actually the real good guys) and are continuously killed doesn't really help comfort me as I watch them all get shot, stabbed, run over, etc. . . It would have been fun to watch if I could only imagine that all those people were mindless thugs following the orders of a main antagonist, but their actual identity and part in the story makes it uneasy for me to watch. . . Even though it's only fiction.<br /><br />If you look at it from perspective, the Smiths are really just cold blooded killers. I don't care that their fighting for their survival. There's no way that justifies killing about a hundred government agents.

1567184855|5.0|I read this book almost 10 years ago, and it totally made sense with the way that I had always believed.  I signed up to be on the waiting list for a regression, and I received a letter stating there was an 18 month or so waiting list.  I only lived about an hour away from Grass Valley.  I never heard anything.  Then, about 5 years ago, I had a life between life regression from somebody who was trained by Newton.  I had always wondered if I would lose my will and hypnosis would make me cluck like a chicken or if they would plant suggestions, but it isn't like that at all.  First, they relax you and then they will ask you a question about what you see.  I really saw things -- not always as clear as if I was watching TV -- but, I was able to get images and information and feel real feelings -- it was a very real experience.  And, there isn't any way that my conscious mind could have fabricated what I saw.  The whole process was mind blowing, and yet it eased my mind.  I really went before a council of elders, and the some of the issues I had then are still issues in this life.  I wouldn't have been able to make the link at the time -- and even during the process.  It is only now -- several years later -- that I can see the pattern and see its relevance.  It is hard to process everything all at once.  I just started looking for websites where people could share their experiences -- I'd be willing to share mine -- and I'm disappointed that I can't find any website that contains this information.  I typed up my experience -- if anybody would like me to share it, please email me at lifebetweenlife@yahoodotcom -- obviously, substitute the dot for a .  And, if you could share your experience with me, I'd really appreciate that.
B000N6TYLW|4.0|I have the entire released collection of GG. The witty dialogue and lovable characters make this show unique from anything else out there. There are really no characters on this show that you can't stand, even the ex-boyfriends, and the meddling grandparents (they are among my absolute favorites).  <br /> <br />I must say, though it pains me, that the innocent family-friendly beginnings of this show took a turn when Rory decided to sleep with her old boyfriend (the married Dean). I know this gave the show an edgy quality, but honestly I liked the show better before this change. We have had enough \\"soap opera\\" programming like One Tree Hill, 90210, etc. I continued to watch, even though I was disappointed, because the characters were dear and charming. I couldn't believe the episode where they try to decide what color to paint the living room. Please! They appealed to a smarter audience than that. Also, in the real world she would have married Logan. She helped him become a great guy. And even though I wasn't \\"head over heel\\" for him in the beginning, I doubt she could do better. They really grew together as a couple. That is what true couples do. Let her wait 10 years to become a lonely reporter, and then she can realize her mistake when she runs into Logan with his wife and family. <br /> <br />Even so...I was still sad to see this show go off the aire. I think it would have recovered nicely given another season. I really wanted to see Luke and Lorelai together, married and with a little bundle on the way (I'm sure I'm not alone here). Let them be happy for crying out loud. I guess making up our own ending will have to be enough. Bye, Gilmore Girls. See you around Stars Hollow! <br /> <br />P.S. Lane Kim was a breath of fresh air. Thanks for giving us a stellar performance. My brother (a Korean-American) would have loved you.
B00007KQKM|4.0|Great Scenes and acting. Though the orginal movie is more erotic, this movie has a better view of Lady Chatterley passion for love.
B000O599WG|4.0|Rio Bravo is one of John Wayne's more enjoyable movies and this movie is considered to be one of the greatest westerns ever made. Wayne is superbly supported by Dean Martin who also carried the movie as well as Ricky Nelson, Walter Brennan and Angie Dickinson. Great cast, superb script and excellent direction make this movie a viewing a pleasure many times over. It has everything anyone want in a John Wayne movie. Gunfights, fist fights, slow developing story to developed all the main characters and even pacing with a song or two thrown in. So successful was this movie that it was remade two more times as El Dorado and Rio Lobo. Amazingly, all three movies were directed by Howard Hawks and starred John Wayne. Even more amazing is that all three movies proves to be just as good and entertaining as ever.<br /><br />This two disc Special Edition of Rio Bravo is a definite upgrade in both quality of image as well as sound over the previous release. I found the running commentary by John Carpenter and Richard Schickel to be somewhat enjoyable but the extra features proves to be a disappointment. There are three special features on the second disc. Two of them, Howard Hawk's Rio Bravo and Old Tucson: Where Legends Walked proves to be quite interesting. However, I was pretty disappointed by the main feature of this second disc, Men Who Made Movies: Howard Hawks. This feature I have seen already on Bringing Up Baby two disc edition (superb Katherine Hepburn/Cary Grant movie). I was very unhappy that a documentary already used in one DVD movie was reused for another. Warner Brothers made a cheap move here. (However, if you do not owned Bringing Up Baby, then you will get more out of the second disc then I did.)<br /><br />I gave five stars for the movie, three stars for the special features, averaging out to four stars for this review. It should be noted that this two disc edition is exactly identical to the \\"ultimate edition\\" although that edition cost more and have a reproduction of Dell comic book based on the movie and promo booklet attached to it.

B000OCXMAE|4.0|First, about all of the people who posted to the discussion before the release date saying, \\"I work for a radio station and I listened to this album,\\" I would like to assert that they are all a bunch of liars, because I am not listening to the same album that they described, whether they wrote positive or negative comments.  Chester does in fact scream, although more of the material tends toward Place Where I Belong kind of style.  And Mike Shinoda has two songs where he raps and one where he actually sings for a change (although that is one of the songs that doesn't grab me).  I pre-ordered this album but procrastinated listening to it because I was afraid that I was going to be disappointed.  No, it's not as good as Meteora or Hybrid Theory, and there are a couple songs that I don't care for at all, but as a whole piece it is pretty good.
0440237688|5.0|THE GIVER is a very well written novel that explores a very strange \\"utopia\\".   A coming of age story of sorts that's  rife with ideas and concepts of interest to young adolescents, the book is perfect for middle school literature classes.  I do have a concern that the book is too often used in elementary schools with students who are not ready to explore the novel's dark speculative themes.  There are many better choices (other Newbery winners as well as other great books) for the third to fifth grade set.   Some may quibble that some of the science behind certain aspects of the society are not sound and  readers focused on such matters will likely not enjoy this perfectly written thought provoking story.  Those who are convinced the book promotes \\"baby killing\\" are also likely to be blind to the book's rich themes. The story's ending is ambiguous but perfect.
B000P0J02E|4.0|(contains spoilers if you haven't seen the movie)<br /><br />-Long John Zimmer and his crew close out the Pirates saga with a highly entertaining score. This time around we get to hear some things we never thought we'd hear in a Jerry Bruckheimer movie like oboes *shock* bassoons *bigger shock* and a great love theme that doesn't suck. *even bigger shock*<br /><br />-Every album has that one moment that you become obsessed with and for me it's \\"At Wit's End\\". The 2:01 minute mark on the track \\"At Wit's End\\" in which a boy soprano *or female singer* joined by choir and other dreamlike instruments play this lovely little melody that just makes your heart melt, is pound for pound the best piece of filmmusic I've heard all year. I just love how mysterious and ominous it is. It's played in the movie for the sequence when Barbosa and Calyp....oops I mean Tia Dialma are talking about the mysterious nature of the underworld that they are traveling. In the movie, you can hardly hear it since it's a dialog scene but on the album you can hear it in all its orgasmic glory. It's the highlight on the album for me. That track also includes the music for the sequence when Jones is playing his organ and starts crying as he remembers his precious Calypso and also for the sequence when Barbosa and Co. face the waterfall.<br /><br />-Other tracks that are addictive as all hell are the tracks \\"Up Is Down\\", \\"Parlay\\", \\"Calypso\\", \\"What Shall We Die For\\", \\"I Don't Think Now Is The Best Time\\", \\"One Day\\", and \\"Drink Up Me Hearties\\".<br /><br />-\\"Up is Down\\" is the fun little piece that accompanies the scene in the movie when Jack and his crew are trying to turn the ship upside down. At first I wasn't a huge fan of this but after seeing it in context with the movie it's really great now. \\"Parlay\\" is great track that accompanies the scene when Jack, Elizabeth and Barbosa come face to face with Will, Davy Jones, and Beckett. It's a wild west moment in the movie and Zimmer takes full advantage of that by paying a very cool homage to one of his idols Ennio Morricone. \\"Calypso\\" is another beautiful track that accompanies the scene when Calypso regains her powers and does something pretty cool that I can't reveal for fear of spoiling the movie for those that haven't seen it. The wonderful choral stuff around the 1:07 mark is I think for the part when she keeps getting larger and larger.<br /><br />-\\"What Shall We Die For\\" is a great inspirational cue that can be best described as classic Zimmer. The last 30 secs. contains some very enjoyable choir moments. \\"I Don't Think Now Is The Best Time\\" is an enjoyable action cue. \\"One Day\\" is my third favorite track which plays out the aftermath of the big battle. It's very heroic and typical Zimmer stuff which is very cool. We also get a full presentation of the love theme in the last remaining moments of that track. The album closes with \\"Drink Up Me Hearties\\" which as you can guess goes with the end of the movie as Jack sails off to his next adventure. If you ever wanted to hear an orchestral version of \\"He's A Pirate\\" then you'll get your wish with \\"Drink Up Me Hearties\\".<br /><br />-I wasn't a huge fan of the past score. Apart from \\"Hello Beastie\\" and the concert presentation of \\"Jack Sparrow\\" I didn't care much for the score for \\"Dead Man's Chest\\", but I love the score to this movie. All the mistakes with the past ones like annoying droning synths and loud stuff that sounds like noise more than music are all gone in favor of a rich and very enveloping score. If you listen to it without watching the movie it will seem rather bland, but after you watch the movie and understand why Zimmer made some odd decisions the music and actually makes one want to watch the movie again.<br />becomes very entertaining<br /><br />-I don't think anyone will call this the greatest film score of all time, but it is very fun and does contain some very memorable cues that make you feel like standing up and saluting and some so hauntingly beautiful that you can't stop listening to it *cough* At Wit's End *cough** At Wit's End *cough*
B000002I55|5.0|While Coleman titled his most famous album The Shape of Jazz to Come, this is really where he threw down the gauntlet, challenging all comers to make something more unique than this. And few had the guts to accept the challenge - this was 1960, after all. I don't think even Eric Dolphy had made the complete jump to avant-garde yet back then. And the critics laughed at Ornette. Fast forward five years, where John Coltrane had taken a cue from Ornette's albm-length masterpiece, putting out his (Ascension). Who's laughing now?<br /><br />It goes without saying that, even some 47 years onward, it's still tough to find a point of comparison to Free Jazz. Coltrane had done the difficult album-length work with Ascension, but this is a whole different animal than Ascension. Hell, this manages to be even free - the original is usually the best, after all.<br /><br />Now here's something for you jazz fans to meditate on. This album consists of two different quartets playing two entirely different things on each channel. So if you put the balance entirely on the left speaker, you'll hear one band, and if you choose to balance to the right, you'll hear another. For all practical purpose, you're hearing two songs at the same time. I suppose \\"song\\" is a loose definition, since structure's been entirely abandonded. Ditching structure is a risky business, but here it's cool by me. Why? Because the performances, besides being completely revolutionary, are simply stellar. Outstanding. A cut above the rest.<br /><br />Again, who was doing anything like this in 1960? Trane and countless \\"progressive rock\\" bands tried the album-length piece thing, but none of their releases could measure up (though Ascension comes close). And the Velvet Underground - more indebtted to free jazz than one who hasn't heard their first two albums would think - had twice experimented with feeding two completely different things through both speaker channels, but it took them seven years to even consider that. And the truth of the matter is that free jazz would never again be this spontaneous. Out of the handful of Coleman records I've heard, I'll have to give this one the edge. Highly recommended, but only for those looking for something completely different. If Kenny G's your idea of \\"jazz\\", you need not apply.of the matter is that free jazz would never again be this spontaneous.

B000089CJI|3.0|There's nothing wrong with this record.  The electo-pop melodies are good, not great.  The vocals are delivered in a detached, bored monotone, a style that has become fashionable this decade.  \\"Such Great Heights\\" and \\"The District Sleeps Alone Tonight\\" are pretty good pop songs, but here's a guarantee:<br /><br />You buy this record now and you will not have any interest in listening to it in a two or three years.  The only way you'll hear any of these songs then is if you're too lazy to update your mp3 player between now and 2010 and one of these tracks pops up on random play mode.
B00000IL29|4.0|What we have here is an album that fails to live up to the standards that the first two and last tracks set. I'd rather hear Miles Davis' version of Little One found on E.S.P. - this one just plods along for a seeming eternity. So does Survival of the Fittest. Both okay songs - neither of them are bad, that's for sure - but they could've seen to be shorter. That's why I don't see Maiden Voyage as being on the same level of Empyrean Isles. It's just not.<br /><br />Now for the good news. The three well-known pieces on this album make it worth the buy. The title track is the token easygoing blues groover (i.e. Watermelon Man and Canteloupe Island) with a simple theme that's hard to get out of your head nonetheless. Next up is the frenetic Eye of the Hurricane, which provides a perfect contrast. Third and final is the quiet ballad Dolphin Dance, a gorgeous thing that rules as much as the other two I mentioned. And that Hancock covers such a wide range of emotions on this record is another point towards it.<br /><br />So I like this album, and like many others this was my first exposure to Herbie Hancock. But he's put out at least one better record, arguably two (Headhunters also makes the list).
0307277887|4.0|An absorbing book of the specters of a sociopath's inner thinking. Portraying the inner thoughts of a \\"sane person\\" - should there be one - is hard enough, let alone do that for someone who is engulfed in darkness and emotionally frigidity. Having read this book, I unconsciously reviewed a mental list of the people I knew who might be Dexters-to-be around me! <br /> <br />For the sake of argument if nothing more, one may claim that killing for \\"justice\\" is acceptable. Where does that put Dexter? The main reason Dexter kills is not to achieve justice, but to gain a bloody sense of satisfaction, and that disturbs me. The fact that I liked the book makes me uncomfortable. I'm afraid that little by little, we are idolizing the wrong figures for what we mistakingly perceive as the \\"right reasons\\".  <br /> <br />
B000002LCI|5.0|For years I overlooked this album, in favor of other Depeche Mode classics like [[ASIN:B000002LK1 Violator]] and [[ASIN:B000002MJC Songs of Faith and Devotion]]. Yet many of the tracks from \\"Music for the Masses\\" kept popping up. Recently viewing a Depeche Mode documentary on Joost (check it out if you haven't), I realized what I'd been missing and picked it up immediately. Today, I can't get enough of it.<br /><br />\\"Music for the Masses\\" is the band's most accomplished album without a doubt. When they recorded it, they were already entrenched into the dark synth-based sound that would characterize the second half of their career, away from the more catchy pop songs that were the norm in their music early on.<br /><br />Every track in the album is a piece of art that collectively make the whole production sound as current and powerful at the time of this writing as it did twenty years ago, when it was released.
B00023B1AS|5.0|ZZ Top's 'Greatest Hits' is a fantastic album.  This long awaited DVD has finally arrived.  This is not a NEW release, originally published on VHS in 1992; I've been waiting 15 years for the DVD edition (my VHS tape is worn thin).  This is a collection of the Music Videos originally shot for each of the songs on the Greatest Hits album.  The sound quality and picture are what one would expect from DVD - excellent.  Watching and listening to this on a big screen with surround sound - goose bumps. <br />For ZZ Top fans this bit of 'nostalgia' is a must have.  For those unfamiliar with ZZ Top, it's a great introduction to both the group and their video vision...  <br /> <br />No there are not a lot of extras since this, as stated, is the original VHS released on DVD. <br /> <br />That fact takes nothing from the quality of the music or the videos.  As a  previous reviewer mentioned, this is not 'The Chemical Brothers' - then again, the 'ZZ Top Greatest Hits' album/video was released when 'The Chemical Brothers' were charting their first single - so there is a big (decades worth of) difference.   <br />Both stand on their own separate merits - but it is like comparing apples to oranges. <br />
0374105235|4.0|A compelling and well written story providing a glimpse into a world that has no rightful place in modern civilization.  The story must be told and listened to; the book is great for that purpose.  Given the gravity of the subject matter, however, I am disquieted by a conviction that portions of the book were fictionalized. <br /> <br />Dickensonian chance meetings can take place, but too many strain credulity.  Early in the book, the author is moments from death when the sudden appearance of government troops saves him.  After a long trek, the author is on the verge of fortuitously reuniting with his family when they are all killed.  I found particularly implausible the authors' overhearing the perpetrators discussing how they had killed everyone in the village and were certain no one had escaped, which stuck me as tying a loose end. <br /> <br />Perhaps of more consequence is the absence of anything that would make the soldiers of either side into three dimensional beings.  The thirst for revenge is explained, but the transition of this thirst into the gratuitous and remorseless rape, mutilation, and killing of innocents is not made understandable in any sense of the word.  The ready availability and heavy use of drugs, to the extent it is offered as a passive explanation, strikes me as cliché.  Something important is missing from the book.
1594489505|4.0|Mirroring the arduous lives of two women caught in three decades of warring factions in Afghanistan, Hosseini's moving novel reveals the horrors of war as experienced by the victims. Mariam is a girl born out of wedlock to a married father; her mother is allowed a hovel far removed from his home, where Mariam's father enjoys a reputation as a successful businessman. Idolizing her father, when she walks to the city on the occasion of her fifteenth birthday, Mariam receives her first dose of reality: her father refuses to acknowledge her in front of his wives. Defeated, her heart broken, she returns home only to be dealt another blow. Left to the reluctant care of her father, the girl is hastily married to Rasheed, a shoemaker from Kabul many years her senior. Experiencing virtually nothing of the world, Mariam suffers the restrictions of a heavy-handed husband who quickly rejects his young wife when she fails to deliver a son.<br /><br />Laila is an intelligent, curious girl raised in an educated family by parents who encourage their daughter's successes. But after her childhood sweetheart, Tariq, leaves the country with his family to escape the increasing violence, a random explosion leaves Laila in the care of her neighbor, Rasheed. Laila marries Rasheed to avoid scandal after spending a night under his roof. Enthralled with his lovely new bride, Rasheed ignores Mariam in favor of the younger woman, Mariam naturally resentful of the new bride. Her world suddenly constricted by Rasheed's insular views of women, Laila is trapped inside a brutal marriage. Each regime change reinforces Rasheed's contemptible treatment of his wives and the women eventually bond as victims of abuse. Taking an interest in Laila's little daughter, Mariam assumes a role that has been denied to her; later, when Laila's son is born, Mariam is as happy as possible for a woman in her situation. Still, their predicament is inescapable, their courage great; hence, the power of the novel.<br /><br />Ironically, the only truly free time Laila enjoys is under the domination of the Communists who allow equal freedom to women; soon after the signs are ominous, from the Soviet years to the Taliban. Once under Rasheed's roof, both Mariam and Laila are virtually obliterated, their identities erased as if they are buried alive in the marriage. Delighting in the ascendancy of the Taliban, Rasheed declares, \\"I, for one, will shower them with rose petals\\". What is increasingly clear as the women are burdened each year by a thankless existence, Rasheed buoyed by an increasingly restrictive government, is how slowly time passes when people are suffering. What is fodder for political debate in one country is life and death in another. Mariam and Laila endure and the extent to which they manage to do so is extraordinary. Politics may be relative, but there is no way to avoid the truth of the suffering of those trapped in the jaws of a government that fails to protect its citizens.

0316018953|4.0|The LA landscape has changed radically for Harry Bosch (Echo Park). Now part of the city's Homicide Special squad, Bosch is teamed with a new partner, the decades younger Ignacio Farras, who is continually flummoxed by Harry's refusal to call him \\"Iggy\\". But Harry considers their relationship on this special squad too formal to tag his partner with a diminutive, giving some insight as to the nature of the senior partner and the seriousness with which he views his job. This bone of contention runs throughout as Harry takes the initiative, hoping to teach Farras the finesse of good police work. Still wet behind the ears, Farras is reluctant to take chances, even when an ongoing LAPD investigation is overrun by the FBI and the rest of the alphabet soup that defines federal agencies. At issue is an execution-style murder on the scenic overlook on Mulholland Drive, the cityscape below a mass of twinkling lights. Bosch arrives on the scene ready to treat the crime scene as a homicide.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the FBI steps in to complicate and usurp, a technique at which they have become adept since the advent of terrorist attacks and the rise of the Office of Homeland Security. But Bosch has played this game before, intent on thwarting the fed's intent to keep him out of the loop. Holding on to one key piece of evidence, Bosch refuses to be denied, frustrating the FBI and Rachel Walling, one of the agents assigned and Bosch's former lover. Thus begins a cat-and-mouse game between Bosch and the feds, including Walling, when the dead man's identity leads to more serious connection; constantly at odds about the context of the murders and potential threat to the good citizens of LA, both sides play hardball, Bosch barely dodging the federal interference. It is to Connelly's credit that he doesn't fall into what has become the ubiquitous pall of terrorism that hangs over thrillers since 9/11, crafting a taut and thoughtful thriller that reminds us to take a step back from the obvious when the call to save the world is more seductive than reasoned police work.

B000OCXMAE|4.0|My friend introduced me to Linkin Park a few years back and they very slowly became my favorite band. I first bought Hybrid Theory, then Meteora, even the Live in Texas DVD. I love how their music was short and sweet but had a huge kick. This new album is completely different. They've ditched the rap-metal for this new electronics-heavy sound. The first thing I noticed is that there's almost no rap. The album mostly features lead singer Chester Bennington musing about either politics or relationship problems. What I like about this album is how varied it is. For example, \\"Given Up\\" is basically a punk-rock self-destruction song, while the next song, \\"Leave Out All the Rest\\" is a light ballad with lots of electronics. The shining moment is when rapper Mike Shinoda steps out to actually sing on the lighthearted and beautiful \\"In Between\\". Overall, it's not perfect (I still miss the hip hop), but it is a healthy change for LP. ROCK ON!
B000P0J02E|5.0|Brilliant!  Zimmer is a genius composer, and with the latest POTC movie Zimmer releases what could be one of his best adventure scores yet!  The entire cd is as swashbuckling as the third movie itself and there is never a dull moment on the entire cd.  Zimmer brilliantly expands on the original \\"Pirates\\" theme, building excitement and emotion with every passing track. <br />The love theme is beautiful and the last four tracks on the cd will knock your socks off!  The only negative is that the cd is too short.  Disney is notorious for skimping on their soundtracks when it comes to an original score releases.  This soundtrack deserves to be released in its glorious entirety, and I only hope that one day and expanded version of this soundtrack will be released.
B000EXZI1Y|5.0|There are several songs on this CD I count among my current favorite songs.  I just recently discovered that Spirits Having Flown wasn't the last of the Bee Gees albums (thanks to the Biography Channel!). I was truly excited to find more Bee Gees music than I had known existed!  I purchased three of these more recent CDs, and Still Waters is my favorite of the three, containing several songs I really like.  Though a review mentioned the \\"urban\\" quality of some of the songs (in general, I'm not into \\"urban\\"), one of my favorites is I Surrender--the harmonies and pulse of this song lifts my mood and makes me smile (the harmonies almost lift the hair on the back of my neck they're so good).  <br /> <br />I'm so glad I took the risk and purchased this CD.  Along with I Surrender, Alone is another favorite as well as Smoke and Mirrors, My Lover's Prayer, and I Will.  Obsessions is probably my least favorite song on this CD; however, the others more than make up for this one song that I personally don't care for.   <br /> <br />The other two CDs, Size Isn't Everything and This is Where I Came In, both contain a few gems I also count among my new favorites; however, Still Waters has the most and is most consistently the best in my opinion.  For those who may be looking for Bee Gees music you've never heard before, this is a CD you might want to take a chance on--the harmonies alone were well worth it for me. <br />
0618680004|5.0|This review is more so about the Audio download feature of this book     The God Delusion was my first purchase from Audible(which I guess Audible is the website that Amazon uses for their Audio downloads). The set up with Audible was fast and easy. Audible has a option that you can check to import your purchased downloads directly into itunes for a one step sync to your ipod or a fast burn to cd. For pc users if you perfer it also has this same one step import option for media player.     Now on to the audiobook itself. I just downloaded and synced to my ipod no more than 10 mins ago. I only listened to the first few minutes to check sound quality which I was pleased with. My only problem with this book is that is read my Mr. Richard Dawkins himself(along with another woman), and Mr Dawkins has a accent. It isnt a very heavy accent but in the few mins that I listened to this book I did have to second guess his word pronunciation twice. However his voice is quite subtle (unlike the upset and roaring voice im sure I would hear if I was actually reading this book), and im sure after the first hour or so of listening to this book I will get use to his accent.    Five stars for the download of this book via Audible                      and   undecided stars for the content of this book seeing as though I have only listened to three mins of this book so far      Update: Ok I have listened to most of this book and if you are looking for pure comic relief you will be sure to find it with the aduio download of this book. Just imagine Richard Dawkins with his british accent reading:      \\"The God of the Old Testament is arguably the most unpleasant character in all fiction. Jealous and proud of it, a petty, unjust, unforgiving control freak, a vindictive bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser, a misogynistic, homophobic, racist, infanticidal, genocidal, filicidal, pestilential, megalomaniacal, sadomasochistic, capriciously malevolent bully.\\"

Good moral reporters trying to help the locals for humanity sake, world officials' who are trying to do some good and not so bad mercenaries who look like they are modern cowboys finishing off with a Hollywood happy ending. <br /> <br />Having said that some of the scenes for example when the rebels took the town, killed, cut peoples hands off and took many into slavery, I thought were good. <br /> <br />The filming is good.  <br /> <br />The acting was nothing special. The casting was not good. DiCaprio should never have put in that role. It did not suit him. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000IU3XTM|3.0|How can Damien Rice have the audacity to present a show (and charge \\"fans\\" for it) without Lisa Hannigan on vocal  and Vyvienne Long on cello? What an ego- / male-centric attitude! I just attended the Wash., DC DAR Constitution Hall show, and I want my money back. Furhter, I encourage anyone who has tickets to future shows to dump them now. He's missing the boat if he thinks his music is that good without them.

The question is can you figure out all the answers?  I confess that I only found out part of it. <br /> <br />The acting is good as is the filming. <br />

B000NVIXDW|2.0|I enjoy MB when I have heard him on the radio, and I really enjoyed his singing \\"Call Me Irrespondible\\" when I saw him on American Idol.  Therefore, I was so looking forward to buying this album.  I purchased it and started to play it in my car immediately.  However, what did I hear in the first line of the 1st song.....a terrible distracting lisp!!!  It got worst thru' next few songs on the CD. I loved the \\"Me and Mrs. Jones\\" arrangement but that awful distracting lisp kept rearing its ugly head.  Did I get a defective CD?
006056251X|4.0|This 3rd installment into the \\"wallflower\\" quartet of books was the one I was looking forward to the most. Evie was a sympathetic, loving character since book one. The premise of setting her up with the throughly disreputable Sebastian was an interesting concept.<br /><br />While the book was largely  very well written, the bed scenes scorching hot, and the characters interesting-there were too many heavily used and cliched  romance plots to make this book a five star. The ending with the villain was way too predictable, as was Sebastians response to the villainy at the end.<br /><br />That being said- there's enough \\"perfect\\" scenes that I would still recommend this book to any fan of highly sensual and dramatic romantic adventure.<br /><br />4.5 stars...
B0000A0DRY|4.0|After all the hype, it's hard to not be considerably disappointed with Jefferson Airplane's second album, 1967's \\"Surrealistic Pillow\\".  It doesn't have the cohesiveness of the first album, \\"Jefferson Airplane Takes Off\\", where even the covers of \\"Tobacco Road\\" and \\"Chauffeur Blues\\" had been rendered brilliantly and fit right in.  With \\"Surrealistic Pillow\\", several of the tracks reek of lightweight filler, specifically Paul Kantner's jangly, Byrds-ish throwaway \\"D.C.B.A.-25\\", as well as a couple of sugary folk-rockers--\\"My Best Friend\\", written by Skip Spence (who played drums on the first album but was already out of the band), would have been right up the Mamas and the Papas' alley (no, that's not a compliment); and there's also the dippy ode to infatuation \\"How Do You Feel\\".  Plus, Marty Balin's ultra-hazy ballad \\"Comin' Back To Me\\", despite some eloquent lyrics, feels like a strained attempt to pull the heartstrings, and it drags too, running on for over 5 minutes, and I also don't like having it positioned in the track listing directly before \\"3/5 of a Mile In 10 Seconds\\".    Now, don't get me wrong--despite everything I just said, many of the individual tracks are fantastic.  \\"She Has Funny Cars\\" is a brilliantly-crafted and nicely rocking opener. Balin gets in a pair of stomping rockers with the roaring, edgy \\"3/5 of a Mile In 10 Seconds\\", and the ultra-witty, insinuating, Dylan-esque \\"Plastic Fantastic Lover\\".  Jorma Kaukonen is spotlighted with his uplifting, solo acoustic guitar instrumental \\"Embryonic Journey\\".  And of course, there are the two well-known hits, \\"Somebody To Love\\" and \\"White Rabbit\\", both of which feature Grace Slick on lead vocals.  This was Grace's first album with the band, and both \\"Somebody To Love\\" (originally titled \\"Someone To Love\\") and \\"White Rabbit\\" had been part of the repertoire of her previous band, The Great Society, with the former having been written by her then brother-in-law Darby Slick, and the latter written by Graceherself.    The Balin/Kantner ballad \\"Today\\" is sort of a mixed bag, featuring a captivating electric guitar line, but again feeling melodramatic, albeit not as much as \\"Comin' Back To Me\\".  It's kind of incredible that Balin wanted to get this song to Tony Bennett who was working in a nearby studio at the time.    As for the bonus tracks on this 2003 reissue, the most significant addition, not counting the mono single mixes of \\"Somebody To Love\\" and \\"White Rabbit\\", is the pleading rocker \\"Go To Her\\" which also appears on the 2003 \\"...Takes Off\\" reissue in a version that was recorded with Signe Anderson (the female singer on their first album before Grace joined), but the version here with Grace is clearly more powerful, and perhaps the fact that the band HAD recorded the song with Signe has something to do with why it was left off the original album.  Spence's \\"J.P.P. McStep B. Blues\\" is another insubstantial folk-rocker, although it would have made a better choice for the main album than \\"My Best Friend\\".  Jorma's \\"In The Morning\\" is a dull, 6+ minute slow-blues, although his rocked-up arrangement of the traditional \\"Come Back Baby\\" is enjoyable.     There's been some controversy regarding Jerry Garcia's role in the making of the album.  Garcia is credited on the album sleeve as \\"Musical and Spiritual Advisor\\", and Kantner, Balin, Slick, Kaukonen, Jack Casady, and Spencer Dryden all confirm that Garcia was prominently involved in the recording sessions.  However, producer Rick Jarrard, along with longtime Jefferson Airplane/Jefferson Starship associate Pat \\"Maurice\\" Ieraci, agree that Garcia played no guitar on the album and that he wasn't present at any of the album's recording sessions.    All in all, \\"Surrealistic Pillow\\" is uneven and overrated.  If you're new to the Airplane, I recommend starting with the 2003 CD reissue of \\"Jefferson Airplane Takes Off\\", although you'll certainly want to move onto \\"...Pillow\\" before long.    (P.S.  I've received two different copies of this 2003 reissue of \\"Surrealistic Pillow\\", and both of them feature botched liner notes.  After the cover and first page of text, it bafflingly switches over to the liner notes for the 2004 \\"Volunteers\\" reissue, continuing all the way up to the track listing page which then goes back to \\"...Pillow\\".)
B00000K3D4|2.0|This is yet another movie from the 80s I remember seeing advertisements for as a child, but not being allowed to see at the time. (This is a children's movie, but rated PG which is a bit of a strange combination. We'll get to more of that below). For one reason or another I never bothered to catch up with it in the years since, but in college and beyond I met several people who were huge fans of this movie. <br /> <br />Although I know this movie has a large cult fan base among people of my generation, I think much of that is based on nostalgia. Which is hard for me, at the age of 29, to plug into. If I had seen this movie when I was 7, I'm sure it would have been a different story. And perhaps if I had seen this movie at 17, when I was just getting into classic rock and learning who David Bowie was, it might still have had a lot of appeal as a psychedelic rock film. But as it was, I'm afraid I found most of the film pretty stale and boring. <br /> <br />It's a pity because there's so much talent attached to this film: George Lucas, Jim Henson, Terry Jones of Monty Python as the screen writer, the drawing of MC Escher...(now that I'm no longer 17, I've decided I'm not a David Bowie fan, but you can't win them all). <br /> <br />And don't get me wrong, there are moments of genius in this film. A lot of the weird fantastic creatures are absolutely wonderful, and reminded me of why I liked the Muppet show so much as a child. And the general atmosphere of the film reminds me of \\"The Jim Henson Hour\\", (a short lived television that was on for a few months when I was in 5th grade) and so gets a couple nostalgia points from me there. <br /> <br />Unfortunately despite all the weird and wonderful Muppet creatures that populate this movie, the story is long, pointless and wandering. And, as usually happens with Muppet movies, the human actors really stink up the stage even though the puppets do a wonderful job. <br /> <br />The humor in this movie is really touch and go. Especially after all the recent children's movies by companies like Pixar which have sharp cutting humor that can also be enjoyed by adults, the humor in the Labyrinth doesn't hold up well by comparison. Typical example: <br />\\"If she kisses you,I'll make you a prince.\\" <br />\\"You will?\\" <br />\\"Prince of the land of stink!\\" <br /> <br />A lot of the humor is also based purely on random strangeness, which is got to be the laziest kind of humor. <br /> <br />And yet, again, there are periodic moments of genius, where the old Monty Python influence seems to be coming through in Terry Jones. Like the scene where the Stone creatures are yelling out warnings of doom, and when they get told to shut up they become sensitive and reply that they are only doing their job. <br /> <br />The obvious comparison for a film like this is \\"Alice in Wonderland\\". Which was a children's film Disney released in 1951 and 20 years later, much to the Disney company's dismay, became known as a classic \\"Head\\" movie. <br /> <br />I think by the time \\"Labyrinth\\" came around, they were already anticipating that this film would be a hippy classic. Call me cynical, but I can't believe the people making this film never leaned over and said to each other something like, \\"Man, this is going to be such a good film to watch while high.\\" <br /> <br />And this is the biggest problem with this movie. It doesn't have a clear idea of what it wants to be. Is this a children's movie with lovable puppets and messages about friendship? Is this a psychedelic rock musical with David Bowie? Is this just a weird trip? Mixing genres isn't a bad thing to do, but it's a dangerous thing to do if it's not pulled off right, and this movie doesn't pull it off right. Scenes from one part of the movie don't fit with scenes from another part. <br /> <br />And the Muppet urinating scene? What were they thinking? <br />
B00007AJF9|4.0|I enjoyed this movie for many reasons. I loved the story and plot. I was amazed at the costumes and scenery. The actors and actresses were surperb. This movie got me into reading a little bit about the Tudors and why she was called a [...]. Before I started to read about the Tudors, this movie confused me a little bit. When I read a little bit about the time, I understood this movie a lot better. I know that Dudley did not betray Elizabeth and was loyal to her until his death. Elizabeth knew that Dudley was married before Cecil told her. There are many historical inaccuracies in this movie and that started to bother me when I read a little bit of history.
0143038419|3.0|I was really excited to read this book.  The first 1/3 of the book (in Italy) was great.  It made me want to run away to Italy!  Very descriptive and inviting.  I'm almost done with the second section (India).  Early on in the book, you discover that she is traveling on the proceeds from the advance of this book.  She talks about her lovely home with her husband and other properties they own.  She lives a very entitled, elitist life and then decides she doesn't want to be in her marriage any longer.  She talks about how people need to follow their dreams, etc.  Well, not everyone can do that.....so, I can't really relate to her.  I don't consider her as a person who has had to struggle.  I do love the way the book is written and I will finish it.  Now, I am looking forward to reading \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" by Khaled Hosseini.  I'm sure there is no phony feeling sorry for yourself characters in that book!

Michael Jackson gave all Artists that came there after him the blue-print at how to make a Album and a Statement,but keeping it Soulful.<br /><br />Don't stop Til you get enough: which was inspired by Marvin Gaye's \\"Got to give it up\\",but MJ had his on vision with creating this Jam which showcases the Versatility of his range. the grooves and the Break-downs are Classic MJ.<br /><br />Rock With You: Rod Temperton wrote this classic Song which showcases  the Smooth and Grown MJ. very polished track that works on so many levels as a Stylist track.<br /><br />Working Day and night:  has that frantic Energy that MJ loves so much. He loves those tight Percussion feel in cuts with the bass riding on the side.

Michael Jackson was Singing Jazz on this Track. the arrangements and textures showcase just how polished and beyond His vocal Years just how truyl Michael Jackson was from his Peers. the Background vocals are incredible.<br /><br />It's the Falling in Love: this is a Duet between Michael Jackson and Patti Austin which again expands MJ's vocal range and working with a Talented Artist such as Patti Austin really stretches things out and beyond.; makes me wish they had have done more tracks together.<br /><br />Burn this Disco Out: a Novelty Disco closer but the energy and the thumping Bass makes this cut work and have lasting appeal.<br /><br />Michael Jackson's raw Energy teamed up with the Versatile  Production of Quincy Jones were a unstoppable force.<br /><br />a great Display of Michael Jackson's  Greatness and Depth.  this Album sounds Great  and is timeless.hael poured alot of emotion into this song. he really captured the Lyric and moment which this song was detailing. this is what a vocalist can truly do when they are One and One within the song. <br /> <br />I can't help it: Stevie Wonder composed this song,but MJ made this song his own.

0142000671|4.0|I first read this book at a young age, curled up on the couch. I found it on the shelf of my mother's bedroom. My mother was suprised to see I had taken it upon myself to read such a book at the age of 10. I wanted to read an adult book, and the slim package of this book seemed undaunting, and unintimidating. I think it opened me up to a world of literature at a young age that has made me love books for a lifetime.  <br />Steinbecks masterpiece is a book you could never forget. It will make you cry, and and laugh.  <br />As the two men in the book are faced with challenges, and the ultimate challenge you sympathize with each character, their struggles, and the consequences they each face.  <br />It's a good book for a young adult, but anyone who has never read this must.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000MM0L2S|5.0|I am a \\"die hard\\" Ennio Morricone fan and have been since 1968, so I can't understand for the life of me why the other reviews for this disk are so negative about this absolutely beautiful album! <br /> <br />I was thrilled to see Ennio finally receive an Academy Award this year! He deserved to receive many Academy Awards over the past 40 years for all his magnificent works. Next to Elmer Bernstein, I consider him my favorite film composer. Many of the selections on this album I had never heard before. Metallica playing \\"The Ecstacy of Gold\\" is absolutely reiveting! Andrea Bocelli is a perfect fit to sing Ennio's songs. Incidentally, Mr. Bocelli also sings two of Ennio's otherwise unknown songs on one of his older albums. Unknown to us in the USA only because Ennio has chosen to focus his life's work on mostly Italian film scores.  <br /> <br />I only wish his scores were more accessable to us living outside of Italy. I have much of his film music, but it's still very hard to find. I truly feel that the genius of Ennio's music will not fully be appreciated until after he is gone from us.  <br /> <br />So to anyone who really wants to know what a modern film score genius sounds like...BUY THIS ALBUM!!!
1582701709|3.0|The book is written differently than I had expected. The \\"teachers\\" quotes are filled throughout with the autors commentary to tie them together. I think the law of attraction, and the power of positive thinking is an important message and can instantly make you feel better, and more aware of yourself- so it's a great book to read. It's motivating- so where is the harm in that right? <br />I think books like this can be somewhat arrogant, and even dangerous. The message is simple- powerful thoughts of what you want. Ask and you shall receive. That's not quite so true.....I think power and positive thought is great- but it ultimately leads you to the actions that make you sucessful...I don't think by focusing on money that a winning lottery ticket will blow onto your doorstep.....It's a marketing ploy that makes people believe....in something bigger than themselves, non-religion based. Again, I think it's a good tool to get people to be motivated positive thinkers, but I think it goes beyond thinking- and you eventually have to put action behind your thoughts to get any kind of success or progress. I mean- what happened to telling people that you have to work hard too.... <br />I read this book because of all the hype and was a little let down...but then again I was not expecting the answer to all my questions either.... <br />It did remind me to think more positively and get negative thoughts out of my head. As soon as you do that you do begin to focus on what you want, instead of the barriers of what keeps you from having it.  <br />I do hope a lot of people will read this book- but don't be fooled! Think good thoughts, but work hard in life too. This book only tells half the tale.

B00006ZXSK|5.0|Imagine Cinderella not as a fairy tale, but as a true story! That is the approach of this retelling of the favorite childhood book. And I just loved it. It opens with an ailing royal agreeing to meet with famous writers to tell her story. They eagarly listen to her share the story of her great great grandmother and how she got that glass slipper, as she presents it to the visiting writers. The movie then takes us back to the \\"true\\" story of how it all came to pass. Drew Barrymore plays Danielle De Barbarac, \\"Cinderella\\" and Dougray Scott plays Prince Henry. A brilliant performance by Angjelica Huston as the mean stepmother as well. The fun addition to this retelling is that they include Leonardo da Vinci as a close advisor to the King and Prince. Everything about this film is wonderful. I've watched it multiple times at the theatre and countless times in my home theatre. This is the ultimate chick flick--but then again most any film starring Drew Barrymore is going to be a hit.
B00006CXSS|5.0|My Husbands Dad was on Normandy Beach on D-day, sadly he was killed in a mining accident when my husband was only 4 years old so my husband never had the opportunity to hear his experiences.

The history and personal interviews make it even more interesting.
B00005JPCF|3.0|I have to say, I was a bit disappointed by \\"Happy Feet.\\" I was so excited when all the trailers for this film initially came out, but then it took me forever to see the movie, and when I finally did, I thought it didn't live up to the hype.<br /><br />The premise of the story is cute enough. The whole deal with this group of penguins is that they're all talented singers, except for poor Mumble (voiced by Elijah Wood), who can't carry a tune to save his life. Mumble is rejected by his fellow penguins, with the exception of his mother (voiced by Nicole Kidman) and Gloria (voiced by Brittany Murphy), the female penguin who captured Mumble's heart from day one. Even Mumble's dad (voiced by Hugh Jackman) is disappointed in his son. However, what Mumble lacks in vocal talent is made up by his incredible dance moves. Unfortunately, though, none of the other penguins in the colony are impressed by Mumble's \\"happy feet,\\" so he instantly becomes an outcast.<br /><br />I wish this could be the basic plot of the movie, but it's not. I figured the film was all about how one penguin's special talent was eventually accepted by everyone else and the moral of the story would be that individuality should always be celebrated, blah blah blah. That's part of the story, but not all of it. I expected the whole film to be filled with dancing, singing penguins, but that only makes up about 20% of the movie, if that. The majority of \\"Happy Feet\\" stresses an environmental message about pollution and animal well-being, and obviously that's a very important message, but I thought it was major overkill in this case. There were times when I actually felt extremely depressed watching \\"Happy Feet,\\" and that was so wrong! Also, in my opinion, the movie is way too long, and of course all the depressing parts of the film were dragged out to the extreme.<br /><br />Bottom line: this is an enjoyable film with fun songs and cute dancing penguins. However, the \\"happy feet\\" aspect of the film was much smaller than I expected, which is why I was kind of let down by this movie. If there's going to be a \\"Happy Feet 2,\\" it needs to be at least 75% dancing penguins and 25% depressing environmental issues...and try to make it slightly less depressing! After all, this is supposed to be a fun movie for kids, not an Al Gore documentary. The word \\"happy\\" is in the title, for god's sake!ich is why I was kind of let down by this movie.

B000NVIGC0|4.0|In the first half of this decade, Wilco released 2 groundbreaking studio albums, 2002's \\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot\\" and 2004's \\"a ghost is born\\", which both sounded miles away from the early alt-country roots of Wilco. Jeff Tweedy put a finishing touch on that chapter of the band with the release of the excellent live album \\"Kicking Television\\" in late 2005, which neatly summarizes that era, indicating that a different chapter was about to unfold. Now finally comes the much anticipated new album of Wilco.<br /><br />\\"Sky Blue Sky\\" (12 tracks, 51 min.) is a striking departure from the previous albums. You only have to listen to the opening notes of the lead-off track \\"Either Way\\" to realize this. Even the opening lines \\"Maybe the sun will shine today/The clouds will break away\\" provide a brighter and more optimistic perspective than we're generally used to from Jeff Tweedy. \\"Impossible Germany\\" is the best track on the album, with a long instrumental outro of 2 duelling guitars. The track somehow reminds me of the title track of Steve Miller's \\"Circle of Love\\" album. The title track \\"Sky Blue Sky\\" is as beautiful and pensive as Tweedy has ever been. Other highlights include the Dylanesque \\"What Light\\", with great lytics like \\"And if you're trying to paint a picture/But you're not sure which colors belong/Just paint what you see/Don't let anyone say you're wrong\\"; the harder charging \\"Shake It Off\\", and the closer \\"On and On and On\\", which perfectly sums up the overall feeling of this album.<br /><br />Jeff Tweedy continues to surprise us, and I couldn't be more thrilled about it. Very different from \\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot\\", perhaps not as ground-breaking in its sound, yet just as satisfy to listen to. I can't wait to see how it all translation in concert, when I see Wilco live next month. Highly recommended!

If you really want something from the \\"nineties,\\" get Countdown to Extinction by Megadeth or get the Pantera albums. Even the Iron maiden albums with Blaze Bayle are ten times better than this garbage. Just do yourself a favor and do NOT get this album. If you really want Fuel, buy it on I-tunes or download it or something, just don't buy this album.
0316018953|3.0|Maybe it was because this done as a serial in the LA Times, but Connelly doesn't give himself the time and pages needed to flesh out a great story here.  I like to see more character development, and I would have liked to see more details behind the change in Bosch's relationship with Rachel. <br /> <br />It's still a decent story -- hence the three stars.  But the ending was rather predictable and the story line just a bit shallow.  I hope Connelly's next effort is more worthy of the praise I would usually bestow.

B000002P5W|5.0|Like Terry Gilliam, Hendrix at his worst was still better than everybody else at their best.  Astoundingly, Hendrix secured his place high at the top of the rock guitar pantheon on the strength of just three albums, recorded in rapid succession.  Axis: Bold As Love, is the middle child, or perhaps, the redheaded stepchild.  It can't touch Are You Experienced? or Electric Ladyland - but it's still pretty darn hot.<br /><br />Rushed out under battle conditions, Axis shows some ragged edges.  The revolting cover, stupid even by standards of the day, was the result of a mix-up.  Hendrix wanted the cover art to reflect his American Indian ancestry - the record company folks in England heard Indian and, (like Columbus in reverse) thought Indian Indian.  Indian religion was all the fashion then, so it seemed like a natural.  All this, however, does not explain away the unadulterated ugliness.<br /><br />More harrowing still is the cab ride story.  In the middle of recording the album, Hendrix took the masters with him to play at a party he was attending, forgetting them in a cab.  (One must wonder if his absent-mindedness was natural or enhanced.)  Realizing what had happened, Chas Chandler had to remix half the album in 11 hours - astonishing considering the amount of studio wizardry featured.<br /><br />The writing is off throughout, lyrics were never Jimi's strongest suit, here it shows.  Even the wonderful Castles Made Of Sand has writing that would have been flagged in a high school poetry class.  The kicker of the litter is You Got Me Floatin' - soaring guitar and driving beat.  The one perfect song, often overlooked, is One Rainy Wish, which evokes a very particular atmosphere and then morphs into something amazing, all in the space of 3:40.  Little Wing is a perennial, lovely, and one of the rare Hendrix songs often covered.  If 6 Was 9, and Bold As Love, showcase Hendrix in fine form.  Both are anthems of the day, and both seem to keep switching gears, every time you think they couldn't be any more thrilling, they kick up another level.<br /><br />Hendrix adapted and changed at lightning speed, a lifetime of evolution compressed into a few years.  Axis is a flawed album, but as the necessary bridge between two near-perfect extremes, it is fascinating and satisfying.time you think they couldn't be any more thrilling, they kick up another level. <br /> <br />Hendrix adapted and changed at lightning speed, a lifetime of evolution compressed into a few years.

B00005JPOE|5.0|After seeing the previews of this movie on television, I ran - didn't walk - to the movie theater and was not disappointed.  Now I eagerly await the DVD release and will add it to my collection, after watching it again, of course.  Ioan Grufford (if only I could pronounce his name correctly) is a fine actor and really captured the spirit of William Wilberforce.  A good movie for the classroom.  It stays with you.
B000002AV5|4.0|There was a time in the mid-`90s when this CD was in permanent rotation at any watering hole sophisticated and snoochy enough to charge $15 for a drink.  It's not hard to understand why; Best of Sade exudes a hip, laid-back smooth jazz sensibility without ever being the least bit intrusive.  It's the soundtrack to your cool life, but you don't need to listen to it.  On those occasions when you take a break from scanning the scenery for tonight's talent, it's agreeably toe-tappable.<br /><br />As musical wallpaper for yuppies it's unbeatable, however, it doesn't withstand much deconstruction.  To begin with, Sade Adu is more exotic than beautiful, and her voice is very, very limited.  It has a buttery texture, but almost no range.  There is some excitement in her lower register, which is where she generates the most feeling.  Overall, Sade resembles Linda Ronstadt in that she makes the most of a range that extends all the way from A to B.  Her pop sensibility is right on time, as in Smooth Operator, but when she attempts to dig down into something real and vivid, as in Jezebel, the results are awkward and embarrassing.<br /><br />Hey kids!  Sade is also the name of the group!  Keyboards, guitar & sax, and bass.  (Perhaps the drum sounds are made by the sax?)  These guys have the presence of narcoleptic L.A. session men.  (Just give me the chart, man.)  Which brings up the real genius of the CD, and the glue that holds it together.  Robin Millar, producer.  Millar uses everything, including Sade herself, as raw material, arranging, rearranging, fading in and out, sweetening, mixing, remixing.  The individual musicians are completely unimportant, their relationships and dynamics meaningless.  Every note is a digital file that Millar fashions to his will.  This is what accounts for the incredibly smooth, homogenized overall vibe.<br /><br />If you doubt this, try Track 14, Please Send Me Someone To Love.  This has the sparsest arrangement and the most minimal instrumentation on the CD.  Sade's limitations as a singer are glaring here, it's painful; the song has as much emotion as a dishwasher repair manual.  Without Millar's brilliantly crafted palace of sound around her, The Marchioness de Sade is just another odd-looking chirp from abroad.'s limitations as a singer are glaring here, it's painful; the song has as much emotion as a dishwasher repair manual.

0312323867|5.0|I absolutely LOVED \\"Something Borrowed\\" and couldn't wait for to dig in to Giffin's second book.  I was a little hesitant at first, because I didn't want to be disappointed like I am with most sequels, but it was so INCREDIBLY good that I finished it in two days! <br />Definitely read \\"Something Borrowed\\" first, if you haven't already yet.  While you don't have to read \\"Something Borrowed\\" in order to follow this story, you'll love \\"Something Blue\\" so much that you'll want to read the first one.  (I think if you do it in reverse order you won't understand the true attitudes of the characters.)
B0009X766Y|5.0|This movie is a true classic. Everything about it is top notch. The cast is wonderful, the music fantastic, costuming is Edith Head at her best, and the story line just keeps you in your seat.  Go to the bathroom before you start the disc, because you won't want to pause till you reach the end and you will want to listen to the music during the credits.<br /><br />It's pure fantasy, of course. Con men are not white knights using their wits to punish greedy gangsters.  They make their livings stealing the life savings of poor widows and selling mixtures of tar and motor oil as blacktop to working people who are just trying to improve their driveways.  They charge young couples to take wedding pictures, but don't have any film in their cameras. They are the scum on the social bog and don't deserve anything but long sentences at hard labor.<br /><br />But- - this movie makes you forget all of that. For a couple of hours, these petty crooks take time out of their dismal lives to get even in the only way they know for the brutal murder of a friend.<br /><br />Robert Shaw is the ultimate villain. He makes you wish that Robert Redford could really find a way to kill him.  He is six shades of mean and seven shades of nasty. He deserves a lot more grief than he gets, but what he gets is delicious.<br /><br />Every movie lover should get and treasure this disc.
B000HWZ61Y|5.0|Great sound quality and I love the B-side songs.  If you are a DL fan you cannot go wrong with this CD.
B000K15VSA|5.0|I hav seen picture's of a 25th Anniversery release that is available in Australia and comes in the form of a brief-case.<br />After trying and trying to find the ORIGINAL (NOT the Directors Cut)on DVD and failing, I resorted to buying an original version on VHS and dubbing it to disk.<br />The ORIGINAL VERSION with the narration and extra graffic scenes<br />(both deleted from the Director's Cut) is,in my opinion,the best!<br />I have also heard that the actress who played Zhora in the Original has recently filmed additional scenes for the re-release!<br />[...].
B000OCXMAE|1.0|I get the fact that bands like to change their sound as they progress, age and adapt to the music industry. Some bands are even successful at this overhaul such as Pink Floyd, Mudvayne, Midnight Oil and the Chili Peppers. Some bands just don't adapt well to change such as Metallica, Korn, Jewel and now Linkin Park. The album is over-produced and far too reliant upon whining vocals and electronics. This is a collection of mostly somber yet mild ballads that lack musical substance as well as meaningful lyrics. The songs all follow a pattern that are trying to say something, but I am having a hard time understanding exactly what. It sounds more like Savage Garden meets Jars of Clay with a rock track thrown in here and there. Sure, they toss in the F-word a couple of times to remind us they're still trying to be edgy, but it comes off as pretentious. This really is an embarrassing attempt from a band that successfully bridged the gap between nu-metal and hip-hop with their previous two albums. All in all, it's really hard to like any of these songs despite my desire to. Thumbs down.
B000HEWEE4|4.0|Um, I dont really understand what happened in this movie. Was he supposed to die in 2004? I thought she saw the accident in 2006. Maybe I wasnt watching closely enough. I know that when the accident happened she had short hair. Had she just cut it.  <br /> <br />LOL, I have no clue what the crap happened in this movie. But it was sweet so Ill give it 3 stars AND Keanu Reeves is hot so Ill give it another star!
B000NVIGC0|5.0|Such a pleasure to hear pure talent on display. Jeff Tweedy's been a critical and cult favorite for the past several years, in part, because his rich musical mind went to work deconstucting songs and busying them up with random ideas. He asked us (no, demanded us) to take the ride---and, quite often, the challenge's been worth it. My concern has been that we were hopping on the Tweedy burnout parade.  <br /> <br />But now, Wilco (and, yes, this feels like a BAND at work) has put aside the druggy psychedelia for pure songcraft. The warmth of Jorgensen's Hammond organ gives a grounded richness to some of the songs and the guitar interplay of Tweedy and Cline covers familiar Wilco/70's Steely Dan/Slash and Burn territory. We had an inkling of what was to come with Kicking Television---their energetic, guitar-driven live album. Those songs burst into life through the fantastic interplay of these musicians.  <br /> <br />The new songs on Sky Blue Sky hold up after repeated listenings and the lyrics never get in the way---in fact, they intrigue. Tweedy's loopy vocal (as they'd say on American Idol -- he's \\"pitchy\\") is a unique instrument in itself. Ragged and loose, his tenor still wraps around a song like no one else in the business. He stamps the songs as his own. And, the full arrangements display a mature sound that separates this band from anything else out there in rock/pop. They couldn't reinvent \\"A Ghost is Born\\" or \\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot\\" without eventually hiding from delivering real, direct SONGS. Yet, they now show they've got the goods. <br /> <br />I began listening to this album with the intent of applying a solid 4 star rating for its consistency throughout. The more I listen and realize the pure beauty, wonderfully vital arrangements, and a splash of edginess applied for good measure: it's a 5.
B000002MJ0|3.0|To claim that \\"Isn't Anything\\" is even in the same stratosphere as \\"Loveless,\\" as a number of reviewers here do, is just plain innacurate.  As any fan will tell you, My Bloody Valentine's next offering \\"Loveless,\\" not only ushered in the entire \\"shoegazer\\" genre, but is still the best album of its kind.  But it's more than this -- indeed \\"Loveless\\" remains a timeless classic, and, from a personal point of view, holds a position as one of my ten favorite rock albums of all time (whereas \\"Isn't Anything\\" probably wouldn't be in my top one thousand). <br /> <br />Sure, there are certainly moments on \\"Isn't Anything\\" where we can detect a glimmer of the brilliance to come.  I would even say that one of the songs, namely \\"(When You Wake) You're Still In A Dream,\\" can almost hold its own amongst the many gems on \\"Loveless.\\"  \\"Sueisfine\\" intrigues me, because I'm quite sure the band intentionally made the chorus sound like \\"suicide.\\"  \\"You Never Should\\" and \\"Nothing Much to Lose\\" work fairly well as lively pop songs.  But if we're going to be truly honest, the best we can say of \\"Isn't Anything,\\" is that it's a decent album that precedes \\"Loveless.\\"  Period.
037571457X|5.0|I had to read this for my Perspectives on Youth Cultures class and I was intrigued because it was the first graphic novel I have ever read. Well, I finished it in one setting! The book is wonderful. It's fresh and being that it's from a child's persepctive she just \\"tells it like it is\\". The graphics are relevant and very effective at adding depth, meaning, and really illustrating what's going on during this time in Iran.  <br />For me, this book was an excellent tool for developing a better understaning of the Iranian Revolution. Some may say \\"Oh it's only one person's persepctive so it can't represent Iran and Iran is not really like that\\". In response, everyone's perspective is just that \\"their\\" perspective. The author writes in such a way that is first-hand knowledge and so \\"straight up\\" that she is a credible source in my eyes. I just purchased persepolis 2 and cannot wait to begin reading it!
0393327345|5.0|When first reading Fight Club, I was a senior in High School. The book caught my attention and featured a storyline that I could never have been familiar with at 18 years old. After reading it again as a 22 year old, I still have no insight to such a world of problems, but can certainly relate to people that I have met in the past. Fight Club is a novel that takes a wonderfully unique idea and expands it to the filth and scurge of society.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|Planet Earth is the best production of nature images to date.  I ordered the BBC version because of its authenticity, but I've watched the American version on television, and they're comparably enjoyable; only differing in the narration.  A must see for all ages.
B000P2A256|5.0|I also own \\"Songs about Jane\\" and enjoyed it very much (loved some songs). But I must say I completely love this new CD, which is really unusual for a band on their sophomore release. <br />It has nice ballads, smoking hot rock and pop songs with obvious fusion of greatness from the early to mid- eighties pop. I am surely dating myself here and maybe because it reminds me of that retro-music with wonderful currentness that I love it soo much. A definite must buy.
0451191153|4.0|I absolutely loved Atlas Shrugged, so when I merely liked this book, I was disappointed. Much of the dialogue seems like it was just there to continue the plot, not act as a philosophical allegory. Until the last hundred pages or so, it seemed like just an ordinary, decent book.
B000N3T0DW|5.0|the performance by Penelope Cruz is great, you really get the character and what she went through!! the plot is incredible, I couldnt believe the comedy aspects found in those subjects. <br />The movie in general has a dark sense of humor, so if you like ironi or sarcasm this is your flick! <br />
B000P0J02E|5.0|I loved the score for the 1st Pirates movie and I was disappointed in the score for the 2nd, but in Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End, Hans Zimmer has exceeded expectations.  I found this score to be powerful, refreshing and classic.  There was much less of the percussion and electronics that drove the score to Dead Man's Chest and much more orchestrational work.  I liked how Zimmer took the song in the first track and made it the main theme of this score, while incorporating themese from the previous 2 films.  Well Done.
B00000IQCA|4.0|Watching this movie is an enjoyable and non-stop \\"hoot\\" (if that term is still used).  It seems that everyone in Hollywood wanted a cameo appearance in this Robert Altman film, perhaps because it was filmed in Paris.  It is true that a critic may find the plot senseless and incomplete, but I doubt very much if the filmakers intended to present a complete and thorough story.  The intent was clearly a parady spoof of the Paris fashion industry and all of its multi-faced participants.  In this regard READY TO WEAR is an outstanding success.
B000001ELL|3.0|Dynasty was released on May 23, 1979 in an effort to revitalize Kiss' popularity in the US again after lackluster sales from each of the 4 solo LPs released last year. The lead-off single \\"I Was Made for Lovin' You\\" was Kiss' 2nd biggest selling single and reached the top 10 in radio airplay, helping Dynasty peak at #9 on the charts and shortly gain platinum status.    Kiss were going through major problems at this time in large part with Peter Criss' car accident and substance abuse eroding his drumming skills (hence why Anton Fig plays on 8 out of 9 tracks) plus fighting amongst the other members which is probably why Gene only plays on 4 songs and sings on just 2(Charisma and X-Ray Eyes with IWMFLY and Dirty Livin', the only song Peter Criss co-wrote, sang and played drums on) in addition to Vini Poncia's slick production sterilizing some of Kiss' harder edge. Unfortunately, the \\"Return of Kiss\\" tour as it was billed didn't fare so well and the end of the Dynasty tour, Peter was pretty much done with Kiss or vice versa.    This album has gotten mixed reviews over the years, with some saying the pop/disco-tinged vibe of the album led to their declining fan base but there are others who highly regard it in their collection. I think it's one of Kiss' more adequate releases. Be forewarned this is not an album that if you like the old sound of Kiss you'll get into with one listen. It'll have to grow on you if you're willing to have an open mind to new musical styles. It took me about 6-7 listens and now I really like it. Here's my review of each of the 9 songs that comprise this album (rating 1 to 10):    1. I Was Made for Lovin' You: What more can be said that it's another one of Kiss' biggest commercial hits (along with Beth and Forever) and a very catchy, dancy, melodic number. If you like disco rock, that's what this tune is. 110%. I love everything in this song from Paul's voice (nice  falsettos in the middle - and he hit 'em all!), Ace's complementary guitars, Gene's funky bass and Anton Fig's pulsing rhythm. A ten all around.    2. 2,000 Man: Covers the Rolling Stones gem and Ace does a great job singing it. Another one of the record's highlights. An absolute 10.    3. Sure Know Something: The second minor hit single from Dynasty. Excellent guitar work by Paul along with a great Gene bass line. Paul also does a great job with this song he wrote about a woman he truly admires. Should've been a bigger hit. I rate it 10.    4. Dirty Livin': Peter's lone contribution on Dynasty. A funk-filled vibe all around. Gene's bass really moves this tune along. Cat's voice fits the song. I see this as his \\"cry for help\\" number. This would be Peter's last studio recording with Kiss until Psycho Circus. He sings it well but moreso GREAT DRUMS BY PETER. What a way to go out! Another 10.    5. Charisma: Yuck. I always skip this song. Uninspired melodies from Gene and a dreadful chorus. Lyrics...meh. Not one of Gene's best. I rate it a big fat ZERO. BLAAARGH!!!    6. Magic Touch: An OK song by Paul. The background vocals and Anton's groove save this tune from being a disaster. Rated 5.    7. Hard Times: Ace's tribute to surviving in the streets: Not his best, but better than the last two. Good rocker by him. 7.    8. X-Ray Eyes: Gene's second contribution to Dynasty and this one is much better. A very enjoyable number. A bit more pop filled but has nice harmonies and Fig shines on this song. An 8.    9. Save Your Love: Ace's 3rd vocal on a Kiss record (he would also sing 3 on their next LP, Unmasked). Interesting chorus with the cut-time beat and smooth backing vocals. Supposedly Ace wrote this for Peter about his ex-wife Lydia. OK closer. I give it a 6.    If you're new to Kiss or want to buy all of their material let Dynasty be towards the middle of the pack. This would be the last time the original 4 appear together (on one song) on a Kiss record. Anton Fig filled in admirably and I believe his drumming saved Dynasty from being a total failure. It's really worth a listen. I rate it 3 1/2 stars.
B00000ILDF|5.0|I believe the title of this review says it all.  Looking back on it this movie would've been an awesome way to end this franchise.  Oh well...
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Amazing pictures and facts on this series.  Its a work of art that a person will never get tired of watching over and over.  Its a keeper.
B000OCXFCO|5.0|People always gripe and compare new music to an artists past releases, and while that should put you on track with WHO they are, it should not be a negative thing.  If Megadeth produced every CD just like Countdown-they would get tagged with doing the same old thing.  On this CD, Dave and Co. amp things up like they would have in the old days with some maturity added in.   At first listen, I didnt know what to expect but after about 1 min into Sleepwalker... I knew what I was in for.  It's the best Metal cd to come out this year by far.  Metallica should take note of this cd and use Dave a model if they hope to even come CLOSE to the intensity of this CD.  UP THE IRONS!!!
B00005JPCF|4.0|I guess Children's movies should come with some sort of moral or message.. but does it have to be so heavy handed as it is here..? <br />This is a beautifully rendered and infectiously entertaining movie about an individual finding and recognising their own form of expression -a wonderful moral tale in itself.  The voice cast and animators all do full justice, and the accuracy of the penguins in terms of drawing and animal habits is astonishing.   <br />However, on top of this the director (George Miller- Babe, Mad Max) has shoe-horned in a message about mans environmental impact in overfishing.  It too is a good message, but feels oddly forced here.  The final q5 minutes of the movie feel almost from a different story. <br />Rest assured, this is still a thumbs up event, greatly entertaining and with a great soundtrack of well known songs.  What a great idea, using well known songs instead of writing them all for the movie, rather like Moulin Rouge did. <br />Recommended - but I still wish they had not forced one message too many down our throats.
B000N3SS80|5.0|Wow! Some of these reviews are harsh. I speak Mandarin and English, I took high school Spanish for a year, I understand about a word here or there from her songs.  <br /> <br />That being said, I know good music when I hear it. For an artist to make me like to her Spanish album is certainly no easy feat. No, I can't tell if her spanish is strained or unnatural sounding, but I can tell tell what shes singing sounds good and the music and beats are not bad either. I can't tell if the contents of her lyrics are worthy of a grammy, but from the lyrical translations I found, they don't seem that bad. Nearly all the songs on this album are worth listening to as well (definitely a rarity these days). <br /> <br />Anyway, I just had to write this review. Sometimes music just sounds good. Maybe it's not 5 star perfect, but sorry, I just had to give 5 stars for those of who giving 1 stars as if this album is trash.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|I just came out of the movie and the enthralling soundtrack is on replay in my mind.  I'm going out to buy the CD right now.  Go and see this movie and get the soundtrack. You will not regret it.
B00005N5S5|5.0|Lots of action from beginning to end. If you love an action film, this is for you! <br /> <br />Schwarzenegger was a perfect pick to play this character.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|I'm not that good in history so I'll leave that part to others. But I did thoroughly enjoy this movie. I can't even remember seeing this movie advertised and was surprised it was made relatively recently. Perhaps the movie is just too long for the theatre and would draw too limited an audience. However, the acting is consistent and strong; the cinematography, particularly the continuity, is admirable. Ridley Scott did a very fine job. It took me a while to finally purchase this DVD set, but I am very happy I did.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I bought this CD after performing some of the music in a concert, what a beautiful score!  I cannot wait to see Wicked when it comes to our performing arts center in 2009.
B000002U9L|4.0|David Bowie's soundtrack from the movie is pretty much what you expect: if you've seen the movie Labyrinth, you've heard the soundtrack.  As a longtime fan of the film and an unabashed child of the '80's, I still enjoy it.  I only wish they'd included a lyrics sheet.
1582701709|5.0|Several months ago I saw the movie, and I began applying the principles of this 'law of attraction' in my life and began seeing IMMEDIATE results.  Naturally, I wanted to learn more. I began to seek out and learn about the contributors/teachers in the movie.  I went to St. Louis, Missouri to see James Arthur Ray and left feeling empowered.  I ordered his 'Science For Success' CD/Workbook set from his web site a few days later.  I purchased the book only a month ago, and it solidified my new way of life.  Our business has prospered, our family has better health, and our spirituality is at an all time high.  I recommend this book with all my being and encourage you to read it (multiple times) and share it with everyone you know.  In our family environment (I have six kids), the children all get along better and are focusing on being happy instead of fighting over petty issues.  It's a book worth adding to your library.  In fact, order multiple copies and give some away.  I broke down and cried the other day because of the positive impact it's had on my family.  Best regards, Harold
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|What can you say about a series that captures not only the essence of an excellent drama/comedy/thriller, but also is a study in human nature from the view of the ultimate outsider: a perfect psychopath.  <br /> <br />We are given Dexter, a charming and voluble man who just happens to be devoid of humanity due to his sideline as a serial killer, and yet is immersed in every aspect of human endevour. He carries on a relationship, a job, a family life... and a little more. It's true that Dexter has a \\"The Code Of Harry\\", which dictates how he acts out his killings and allows him to be the protagonist, but he is still a damaged person who is incapable of empathy and critical insight. <br /> <br />From this vantage you join Dexter as he struggles to do more than ACT the parts of boyfriend, brother and coworker. He tries in an endearing way to plumb the void in him that drives his savagry, and distances him from his fellow man. In doing so the comedic elements of show flourish as his mask of sanity and charm is accepted by all (ok, all but one or two). The excellent narration provides a kind of puzzled and blunt analysis of the world Dexter moves through. <br /> <br />Of course, there is so much more to be found in the violence and the tension of the cases he is involved in as a forensic blood spatter expert. As the First season unfolds, the plot hooks you and makes you crave the next installment. As odd and dark as it so often is, life in from Dexter's vantage is a unique (and evolving) study in modern sociology and psychology paired perfectly with pulse-pounding action and suspense.  <br /> <br />Give this show 15 minutes of your time, and the next thing you know you'll be wondering what's taking season 2 so long to come out!
B00004Z4SD|5.0|I consider this a classic story since it reminds me of growing up in upstate New York.  You can't help but end up loving this character.
0618680004|4.0|The God Delusion is a difficult book to adequately summarise in a single post. Richard Dawkins covers many different topics, so trying to pin down a central theme is somewhat of a challenge. But if I were forced to provide a brief description of the book, I would say that The God Delusion is a description of what it means to be an atheist living in the 21'st century, and a portrayal of how most atheists view the world, society and religion. <br /> <br />Dawkins' main aim of the book is to raise four consciousness raising messages: (1) that atheism is a realistic aspiration for any individual; (2) natural selection describes the complexity of life better than the Creator hypothesis; (3) children should not be labelled by their parent's religion; and (4) atheists should not be apologetic about their beliefs. Although Dawkins focuses on these four central themes, he also explores other topics, such as the origins of religion and the evolutionary origins of morality. <br /> <br />The most significant message of the book for me was Dawkins' message that there is nothing wrong with unbelief. On page 1: <br /> <br />\\"[This book is intended to] raise consciousness to the fact that to be an atheist is a realistic aspiration, and a brave and splendid one. You can be an atheist who his happy, balanced, moral, and intellectually fulfilled.\\" <br /> <br />In Chapter 4, Dawkins focuses on the well known creationist argument that design was responsible for life because biological complexity is too improbable to have arisen by chance. Dawkins argues that both chance and design were not responsible; rather, the third option, natural selection, caused complex life by breaking down improbability into small pieces. Although I disagree with Dawkins' argument that refuting design refutes God (at least, this is what I think he argues), his arguments for evolution are, as always, his strong point. <br /> <br />However, I thought the weakest part of the book was Chapter 3. Dawkins' critiqueof philosophical arguments for God seems far too simplistic; he hurries through each argument, and as a consequence they are only superficially covered. I feel there are better books out there that provide more comprehensive responses to philosophical arguments for theism. <br /> <br />Finally, I have difficulty with Dawkins' confrontational style. I absolutely share Dawkins' concern regarding religious fundamentalism, but I think his abrasive approach to religious belief in general not only polarises religious debate, but also hinders constructive dialogue between those on opposite sides of the fence who are willing to speak to each other. <br /> <br />In conclusion . . . <br />Although I admire Richard Dawkins' views on biology, I've always been uncomfortable with the antagonism he expresses towards religion in general. Although the book provides a clear summary of atheistic beliefs, arguments and concerns, its confrontational tone in parts might turn some Christians off from reading it altogether. This, I believe, is sad, as there are many parts of the book that provide positive and refreshing insights into what it means to be an atheist.
B000KLRUKC|5.0|Spinto voices are an almost extinct breed in today's operatic world. The only spinto voice will the required thrust, power, squillo, and timbre today would probably belong to that of Aprile Millo, whose several Verdi recordings display her excellent musicianship and impressive vocal qualities. Throughout the course of modern operatic recording history, only five true Aidas have been captured in the recording studio. They are Zinka Milanov, Renata Tebaldi, Leontyne Price, Maria Callas, and Aprile Millo. All other Aidas such as Freni, Ricciarelli, Montserrat Caballe, Gwyneth Jones, Birgit Nilsson, Margaret Price, Maria Chiara, and the whole lot of them are either dramatic (Wagnerian) sopranos or lyric sopranos who do not satisfy all the requirements of this Verdian role. Dramatic sopranos like Gwyneth Jones and Birgit Nilsson are certainly more than able to handle all the requirements of the music, but they lack an Italianate sound which while not necessary, make the role all the more endearing. I love Gwyneth Jones in Aida, but she will definitely not compare with Tebaldi or Price in the role, as magnificent as she is in Strauss, Wagner, and Puccini. Lyric sopranos on the other hand, almost die when they try to sing the demands of this Verdian grand opera role. It is not that they cannot sing the notes--lyrics can, but they do not have the squillo of spintos. Unfortunately, with a vocal music education predominated by Mozart and Handelian singing, these golden age singers are rapidly disappearing, and we must turn to the past for great recordings of just about anything except period music. <br /> <br />This recording of Aida is simply put, the best on disc. The conducting, the orchestra, and the singers make this musical experience very special, and it helps that Karajan was in a very romantic-intimate mood while conducting this performance of Aida. With the Wiener Philharmoniker, he produces some of the most intricately detailed orchestral sounds seldom heard in interpretations of Verdi's score. I dare say that although his conducting is not idiomatically Italian, if it is not like Serafin's or Muti's, he perhaps makes the most out of this score and produces a most exciting performance. <br /> <br />Renata Tebaldi is nothing short of amazing in the title role. Although her voice was fresher in the first recording with Decca, it did not change much to make any Aida moments sound difficult for her. Also, her interpretation of the role deepened (perhaps Callas influenced her), so what we get is a more intimate and exciting portrayal of the Ethiopian princess. With her golden voice and that perfect squillo, Tebaldi is perhaps the best exponent of this role. Her Radames is Carlos Bergonzi, and even if he did not have the thrilling power that Franco Corelli gave to the role, he certainly had the best Verdian style of all the tenors who sang the role. There are some moments where one would wish that he would cry his heart out or sob like Corelli did, but Bergonzi is in a class of his own. It is a different, more noble, more controlled Radames than Corelli or Domingo, and I would say that I far prefer him to Domingo. Simionato is simply amazing as Amneris. Everything that this mezzo touches spits fire and blood across the stage, and her ability to color her voice at will makes her Amneris a benchmark upon which others will be judged. She is the best Amneris of the three Italian greats--that is, Barbieri, Cossotto, and herself. Brava! Cornell Mac'Neill was the leading Verdian baritone of the 50's, and his performance in this recording shows why he was sought after in the role of Aida's father. The soloists in this recording perform with a romantic intimacy that is almost absent from the many Aidas on the market, and this is why I would recommend this recording to anyone who would want to discover Aida's music.

1594489505|5.0|In Herat, Afghanistan in 1959 Nana was a housekeeper to Jalil, an affluent businessman with nine legitimate offspring and three wives.  When Nana became pregnant, Jalil exiled her.  She gave birth to Mariam, a harami (illegitimate) baby, who she raised by herself with scorn for the child and the father.  When Mariam turns fifteen, Nana hangs herself.  Jalil marries his illegitimate daughter to forty something shoe maker Rasheed.  Thus she moves to Kabul to live with her husband.  Rasheed enforces traditional values in his young wife and over the years he gets very angry with Mariam blaming her for her numerous miscarriages.<br /><br />In the 1980s, the Soviets rule with an iron fist, which ironically allows women some freedoms they never had before the occupation.  However, by 1992 the Soviets are gone and the Taliban turn women back into slaves.  In Kabul, Mariam's teenage neighbors Tariq and Laila make love just before he leaves for Pakistan; soon afterward, Laila's parents die. Rasheed brings the fourteen year old into his household with plans to make her wife number two and give him the heir he deserves.  Laila gives birth to a worthless female, but Laila worries that soon her new elderly husband will know this is not his offspring.<br /><br />This is a fantastic novel that looks at Afghanistan over a four decade period through mostly the eyes of Mariam.  The story line is character driven as Jalil, Nana, and Rasheed vividly represent one generation; Mariam the sandwich generation; and Laila and her newborn the younger generation.  Fans will see the ironies of what happens to women under Afghan, Soviet, and Taliban rule.  Khaled Hosseini provides a great saga that will have readers lining up for more tales as A THOUSAND SPLENDID SUNS will be on most short lists for novel of the year.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner

B000OCXMAE|1.0|Ok, so they wanted to change...  Too bad because their talent is in what they were doing.  <br /> <br />This album is horrible.  There is NOTHING to catch you and make you want to come back.  The melodies suck, there is no more rap or hard core anything.  Its like the Back Street Boys with occassional screaming and a few gratuitous F-bombs to disguise the fact that it sucks.  <br /> <br />Too bad fellas.  I was looking forward to more of your skill.  Wish it would have stuck around.  Not only that, but my boys are big fans and can't listen to the album.  Why?  Because you need to express yourselves with the F-word for some reason.  Lame.  That isn't growing up guys, its copping out. <br /> <br />DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GARBAGE.  YOU CAN HAVE MINE.
0812975219|5.0|Wow! 305 reviews! I heard the author on a podcast with Russ Roberts and was intrigued enough to purchase both this book and The Black Swan. First, like my title says, I have to acknowledge that this review is more about me than Dr. Taleb or his book. I haven't read all 305 reviews, but if I'm the first to say that, then 305 people sure didn't get the point! Let's hope randomness found him at least a few outliers who paid attention...<br /><br />I especially liked (see, this review is about *me*) the style of his argument: concrete examples mixed with surveys and summaries of literature, from classic thinkers to contemporary researchers in a variety of fields that tend to support his thesis. I feel as if I wanted to dive into some serious academic study of randomness that I could pick one of a hundred places to jump off, from portfolio theory to biology.<br /><br />In an interesting juxtaposition, Dr. Taleb's appearance in Russ Robert's Econtalk podcast followed that of John Bogle, founder of the Vanguard funds and a pioneer in low cost index funds. I'm sure Taleb would argue that there is a black swan lurking even in the stock market indices, that the old wisdom of playing for the long term (20+ year horizon) does not guarantee profitability much less favorable performance against decent grade bonds. I'm not too sure I buy Taleb's insight quite yet. Technology and productivity gains, regardless of whether we have good measurements for them, look like a trump card against catastrophic index fund performance. Unless of course global warming or nuclear war or termites wipe out our country, and I don't see anyone betting on those things happening yet.<br /><br />As for economic math, which Taleb addresses at length... Since my days in grad school (theoretical computer science) at the beginning of the popularization of the Internet and the WWW, I have thought that calculus was the wrong model to dominate economic thinking. That instead, graph theory (vertices and edges, aka network theory) would yield better insights about the collective interactions of individuals. And with Hayekians making a comeback in the field, perhaps we'll see that. They'd be wise to explore the operations research literature and dig up Markov chains too fill out their tool belts.dges, aka network theory) would yield better insights about the collective interactions of individuals.

B000NVIXFK|5.0|As with every Rush release I hope for and expect a lot and Snakes and Arrows delivers in a big way!  <br /> <br />From the first radio play of \\"Far Cry\\" I was hooked and waited anxiously to tear off the wrapping and immerse myself into the the lyrics, the drumming and the overall feel of their latest effort.  <br /> <br />Right from the first listen you can appreciate the time, energy and creativity that went into this album. SA goes back to the very roots of Rush with wonderfully textured melodies, off time signatures, meaningful lyrics and great overall ROCK sound on every track. (Alex is back!)  <br /> <br />The sound is very well balanced, the music breathes and the pure musicianship shines through without all the keyboard parts \\"clogging the pores\\" as we've heard on past albums. The instrumentals are great and stand up well to being compared to YYZ. (Although they may not sing along live in Brazil to these ones.) Neil seems healed and has a new appreciation for life that really comes through with powerful, hopeful, even spiritual lyrics that meld well into the mix. (I find myself signing along to \\"We hold on\\".)  <br /> <br />Whether you're a long time fan or just discovering Rush, this album has something for everybody and it just keeps getting better and better with every listen.  <br /> <br />\\"Keep going until dawn...!\\"  <br />
