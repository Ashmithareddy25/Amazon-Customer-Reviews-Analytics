B000QRIGLC|5.0|Deeply moving story about what men do to defend our country. An absolute must read...  Have Kleenex for the end of this story...
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|The app works great, very easy working. Has help a lot with managing  my kindle. I would recommend it. It maximizes the functioning of your device.
1250038820|5.0|It's everything I expected and being a New Yorker really loved it.  What more can I say?<br />One hell of a great book.  Hope he does another.<br />Jim

B003IEJZUG|5.0|I gave The Life of Pi a 5 rating because the story kept moving. I would recommend for any age.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|lots of fun and would recommend to play.  very hard to put down the only problem is you should be able to buy all guns with cash instead of coins.
B00G21YLF6|4.0|The only wrong with the 50th anniversary is how much Amazon charged me to watch it. Beyond that, the story and the performances were great.
B004LWZVZC|4.0|Liked it though it tended to drag without much action. But given that it was a story from Mrs. Surratt's perspective, it was fine.
B000RH0C8G|5.0|A must read for all baseball fans.  If you claim to follow baseball, this book will really open your eyes
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I love this game is a awesome game and the graphics are great inlet my sister play it she loves it
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I am looking forward to season 4.  This has been a great series as most British series are.  So much better than most of the stuff on TV today.
B00AWJYJVA|4.0|An enthralling  and tense read with good characters and a sense of impending doom- but that hanging finish!! A b
B009ZQJ1G4|1.0|boring after 30 minutes, I have stopped watching. The acting is not good, the visuals are not good, and I haven't seen any effects that were supposedly up to the standards of the Matrix. Believe me this is not the Matrix.
B003XHLIUS|5.0|love this figure the details are awsome the paint job is great its a perfect gift for your kid aor collectors.thank you.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game is easy to play. Life like action. No headache like playing on a game console.<br />Highly recommend. Get the app now, great for killing time while you kill stuff.

Michael Fassbender,Hot,Sex,Pain,Past,Love,Lost,Hope,Addiction,Pride,Wealth,Power,Family,Work,Lust,Shock ...SHAME!<br />Steve Mcqueen, Genius!<br /> In no order these are the only nouns and adjectives that truly describe this film. This isnt a redemption story but its someones story and its awesome. AMAZING MUST WATCH NOW!!!!!
0316019984|5.0|Marvelous!<br />Great buy. I will never get tired to admire the incredible foldables. I am buying anther one for sure!
B0060D123K|1.0|Major disappointment.I love this movie. I bought it on amazon instant. why did you cut the song by belle?! This is not the first movie I have bought that had scenes cut out.  And that is a great part of the movie...
B002SJIO4A|5.0|even if you are not into science fiction (I am not a SF fan) I would recommend this movie, especially if you have been to or lived in South Africa since there are numerous analogies and inside jokes based on the SA culture. People who don't get those jokes can still enjoy the story and all the action involved. I have been hoping for a sequel.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This game you can't put down. Always trying to go to the next level... And beat the other player. Funny to have known the people that play.
B003BW0CB6|2.0|A slow procedural legal crime novel, no real surprises, and an unsatisfactory ending<br />Let's hope the next book is better, because this one was a letdown.
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|Great music if you love Blake you will love this new album.  One of his best EVER.  Play it constantly, gave one as a gift too alo pleased
B008JFUTT0|5.0|Powerful story of a humble man and how he got duped out of millions by his agent. Everyone who thinks the record companies and these agents deserve to breath should watch this move.
B004P1JEWU|5.0|Old fashioned amazing story telling, unmatched characterization and intricate engaging plot. If you loved Game Of Thrones you'll love this even more.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This was a wonderful read full of surprising connections between characters. I found it hard to put down until those connections all came together. It was easy to identify with each character's emotional ups and downs. I loved this book and would recommend it to anyone. This is a great book club book with oodles of discussion possibilities.
B00BXKOMT6|3.0|Unfortunately, my opinion isn't as glowing as the majority of the reviews here. I really wanted to like the novel, and the first few chapters were good, but (to me) Blood Song fizzes out half way through.<br /><br />The plot is not bad, but it really doesn't add anything to the myriad of medieval fantasy books out there, comparing to, say, Wise Man's Fear series (Rothfuss), Caine series (at least the first books, by Stover) or, my favorite, any of the Abercrombie books (not even mentioning George Martin's bible). The characters, I found, were one dimensional. Except for Vaelin (main character), it's hard to remember other characters and, well, I really couldn't bring myself to care for their fates (there's no 'oh my God, he killed so-and-so!!' as there is in the George Martin novels - I remember going numb when Robb Stark got iced). People die and it just doesn't leave an impact.<br /><br />The writing is pretty straight forward, with no 'gasp, what a wonderful paragraph', or 'my, how well written', or 'what a great concept'. It's mostly effective in the way it describes situations (with some *groan* cliches sprinkled in), but it's not epic material (as Abercrombie's are).<br /><br />Going back to the plot: I found some situations forced (like the romance at the end, even though he does build up to it, there's just no fire), the final 'bad guy' scene is not very good, the way the invasion ends felt rushed, etc. I understand there are other books in the saga, but this one felt ... superficial. Sorry.<br /><br />All in all, not bad (and if you've read all the others I mention, go ahead and give it a try), but I believe there are better out there.
B00GH4RKYM|5.0|A good superman movie. I'm going to watch it again if I can. I think for the rental fee, more days should be included.
1451666179|5.0|Allie Brosh is so funny and real. She really knows how to spin a good story and get you caught up in her awesome neuroses.
B00E9ZFIMM|3.0|Not user friendly<br />It is not easy to use I would not recommend it . I would try something else first
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Certainly one of Grisham' s best. Good character development and an interesting plot. Didn't want to put it down. He tied up all the pieces in the end which many storytellers can't do.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|All of Cruise's movies have a good theme. I guess that's why he picks them and the directors of them.\.
B0002YJ29O|2.0|It was not made clear that this American recording can only be played on speciel equipment that I don't have. In my view this is no good business practice.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|VERY INTERESTING MOVIE.<br /><br />clearly important for everyone to see.  wonderful movie. Also very scary thinking of what is going on in the US today.
B00AZMFK3K|1.0|Nothing says &#34;sucks&#34; for a major picture like being found in in the dollar bin six months after it's release
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Fun like the old arcade game! But I can take with me. Thanks for the memory.  Got it for free
1426308469|5.0|my 6 year old son loves it, there is so much information and beautiful pictures, we spend hours reading this
B001KOFH2G|5.0|If you don't already know, there's nothing new I can tell you.  Well, it should be noted that Summer's bar fight is one of the best fight scenes in the history of movies....
B006IGZX0C|2.0|the help was a long boring movie would recommend only if it was the only movie ever available, in other words don't bother.
B003V9OCS8|5.0|Great!  I only wish movies of this quality would be made in the United States.  You will not be disappointed, money well spent.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Great game if you want to zone out from the real world for a little while. Sucks you in and you want to keep playing because each thing seems to be almost ready to get right before you log out.
B00BAXFECK|4.0|The Goldfinch is a marvelous, imaginative story, skillfully written. However.  The mid section -- Los Vegas locale -- and the endless drug scenes -- needed editing: too overwhelmingly repetitious.
B0001RVTXO|4.0|Yo!!!! The Pixies are all rule!!!! Best of, some but not all, could have been a better discography. 'CARIBOU&#34; &#34;HERE COMES YOUR MAN&#34; &#34;ALEC EFFEL&#34; said jams but buy it just because of track 15....Fight club anybody!!!!
0300169787|5.0|I purchased this as a gift for two people after seeing my friends copy.  The cover alone was a major reason for buying it.
B001HN6EF4|5.0|Very nice cards, more durable than the regular paper based cards. We use these every time we play (group of 5-7), easy to handle (though a little difficult in the beginning). Even if you are not planning to use it in wet conditions like pool, tub etc., this is a good buy.
B00F3VOL38|5.0|Yeah Yeah Yeah !!--I waited as anxiously for this release (at 62 years of age) as when I waited when I was 13 waiting for Beatles releases then.<br /> A life of listening enjoyment and it keeps coming. An ABSOLUTE must for any Beatles fan. There are several surprises included on BBC 2. The vocals are amazing which just shows the talent these boys had right out of the gate. Waiting for BBC 3...
B0093URN4E|4.0|Voted best album of the year in 2012, I don't think it's better than Axe to fall, No Hero's or Jane Doe Good but not better Sorry yall...........
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Master writer Susan Collins, has in three volumes, captured  Hunger in all its various forms: starvation, greed, pride,  revenge, power and most of all love.  This is a rivetting read!  DO IT.
B00GO95BUU|5.0|&#34;The Day of the Doctor&#34; is a brilliant story with excellent visual effects and character development. Moffat is a genius of an author, and the acting and film making are excellent.<br /><br />The reviewers who are giving &#34;The Day of the Doctor&#34; only one star are giving that because it costs six dollars instead of two dollars, but &#34;The Day of the Doctor&#34; is a movie, not just an episode, and in my humble opinion, it's seriously worth six dollars. I really enjoyed it a lot. Excellent story telling. There were funny moments and epic parts and a suitable bringing together of Doctor Who's Fifty Years.<br /><br />I'm only speaking to the excellence of the actual movie &#34;The Day of the Doctor,&#34; not reviewing the other documentary and retrospective items in this list.
B00EDUTGB2|4.0|I have only used it once since downloading it and it worked very well. Although I most likely won't use it very often, I am sure that it will come in handy occasionally.
B007R3B4RG|3.0|Love the Ramones, this record has a few gems but falls short.(sorry Joey) Tracks like, &#34;Party line&#34; and &#34;I couldn't sleep&#34; have that 50's 3 chord thing going on but other than that doesn;t compare to his first solo record.
B0051SDM5Q|4.0|This book give a lot of sense and helped me bring some good theory around technics and situations. It definitely help re-think the way you should negotiate to set yourself for a successful negotiation and long term result.
B000QUCNOK|5.0|Wonderful movie. I have read the book while in high school and thought it was interesting, but quite long and a little boring at parts. However, the movie was so well made that even during those longer parts, I was still excited. A must see.
B0094M2X6Y|5.0|Lots of action, good story, mixture of live and superimposed well blended. The hero gets the girl for a happy ending.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great really good book cliff hanger movie is great too!!!! I recommend this book to pretty much everyone so yahoo read this!
0802473156|4.0|I bought one for me and one  for my husband as we sailed the Caribbean seas. Very good choice for vacationing
B00BD99JMW|3.0|What an absolutely horrible ending to an otherwise outstanding book series.  I hated the ending.  I normally prefer movies stick to the story from the book, but in this case I really hope they change it when they make the movie.<br />I did not like the way the narration went back and forth from Tris to Tobias. Very hard to follow.
B004XWLN20|2.0|I LOVE Smallville but the packaging isn't worth it.  The discs were scratched  before I got to see them and the way you have to slide the discs back in the booklets makes them susceptible to more scratches.  Get Smallville, just NOT in this packaging.
B00FHB7398|3.0|AAARRRGGHH!!!  I was really enjoying this game despite the slow movement between scenes, and the fact that every time you want to check out your journal, it has to download (and really, it's not worth the bother), but what I can't take any more is the difficulty in using objects on other objects in the HOS.  For instance, I just spent 5 minutes trying to put the hammer in EXACTLY the right spot to break the glass.  This is the third or fourth time this play session that I have had this problem.  I play these games for fun, and I am not having fun, so I quit.  If this doesn't bother you, or if you possess magical positioning abilities, then this is a good game.  For the rest of us, not so much.
0802473164|4.0|I bought one for me and one  for my husband as we sailed the Caribbean seas. Very good choice for vacationing
B00F7YHDWC|3.0|This is a good game but on the plane one I can't play because I don't have a thing to blown in
B000PC0SPU|4.0|As a right-brained person, I have often felt very alone in the corporate world.  Daniel Pink gives me hope that my instincts and creative vision are valuable and cannot be outsourced.
B00005N5S5|4.0|Awesome movie with great quality!!  i did not have any problem playing the movie in the dvd player ,not fuzziness or something  so i recommended this special edition movie.
B0050AV5MW|5.0|Involving characters, plot twists, and Tyrion. An engrossing story that I wish would end so i can find out if my favorite characters survive or not!
B00GIZO674|5.0|This game is worth it . And very addicting I'm so hooked its the only<br />Thing I think about now. Believe me you will regret if you don't get this game
B00EEL0LGY|5.0|This is the portable equivalent of hydro thunder. If you like any water racing games, then you won't regret getting this game.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game!  The challenges are often difficult, but not too hard to overcome. Thanks for making such a great game for me to enjoy on my Kindle!
B000FBJF6Y|3.0|being a book club selection I would not read this type of book.But being I did read it I feel it was not that good.
B00003CX6P|3.0|It is an okay movie. Definately suspenseful. I had a hard time keeping my interest and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a slower movie.
B00DDXJRJG|5.0|I did have this app till my kindle restarted itself. it is amazing for all type of genera it just sucks it's not free anymore...fix that amazon.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Entertaining game. Nice that you can earn acorns to buy special items instead of having to purchase them with real money as is the case with so many other games.<br /><br />I had to start over when I updated the game though. It appears files were corrupted during the process
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Like the two others, just a continuation of greatness , with suspense/ twist at the end of the series. Wow I love this series.
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|As someone with loved ones who are in recovery, I found this movie to be heart-wrenching and inspiring.  Bravo to the director for not glamorizing the disease of alcoholism.
B008EL25LE|5.0|While short and relatively expensive I enjoyed the story telling and the puzzles. It also happens to look really nice and &#34;artistic&#34;. The &#34;achievement&#34; system it has adds a decent amount of replay value without feeling too repetitive. The one thing I would have loved to have is a way to raise difficulty. Since you get more and more &#34;bonuses&#34; as the games goes on it make the second half of the game a bit too easy. This ends up making the &#34;final level&#34; easy and anti climatic which may be another reason why it seemed short.
B002HJ9PTO|3.0|For the price, this lavalier microphone provides good, solid audio with a major caveat.<br /><br />I attempted to use this microphone with a Canon EOS 60D; it plugs right into it via a 3.5mm port.<br />The audio recorded is clear and balanced, however even after messing with the gain levels on that camera itself, I was not able to rid the recording of a loud hissing noise in the background of every take.While it is possible to remove this in post-production, it is difficult to do so. This hissing was also noticeable when I plugged the microphone straight into my Mac.<br /><br />While this mic provides a great audio solution, especially for the $19 price, you definitely get what you pay for.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|awesome acting and story. It really feels like you know each of the characters personally. can't wait for season three
B00AESN8XY|5.0|My 14-year-old son wrote this review: This app is really fun, especially because of the new speed run mode that lets you challenge yourself and your friends at who can infect the world the fastest. It is a great game.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Hooray! Grisham is back to writing again, not just producing books. His goal of two a year isn't realistic, if he really want to write a thriller like &#34;Sycamore Row&#34;. I liked the re-introduction of characters we'd visited in other Grisham books. It made the whole of the story familiar. A comfortable read that was compelling. Therefore, a rating of &#34;I loved it&#34;.
B00BSB2AE4|3.0|An interesting look into the author's mental state. I thoroughly enjoyed and identified with her and the ideas she chose to explore.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|This book was long awaited for me and it did not disappoint! I had my mother read the first part out loud while I need some distraction during a round of medical tests and I could hear giggling from everyone in ear shot! I love the fact that its color coded by story and the size of a regular book :) It got me through close to three hours of medical tests, then you can read it on the toilet! JUST BUY IT ALREADY!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I dont believe in unhappiness. I believe everyone who has evil in them faces endless war mentally.\\"Evil is a war that must be fought but can never be won\\" Those of you who judge are fighting an evil they dont know about. They just need to find it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is one of the best games i have played in my life but they should add more costumes in the game
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was an amazing book! I loved it, words can not explain...well done Suzanne Collins, you have created a masterpiece.
B000YJ85BI|5.0|John Scalzi has a way of getting the reader invested in the lives of the main characters. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and the entire series. I highly recommend the Old Man's War series.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I love this app the only problem im having is ive finished everything on region 6 and its not downloading region 7
B00B2V66VS|5.0|When I was playing this game it made me happy so much because when I play I never die and my sister does in the beginning
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|its fun and i like it . i dont think there should be anybody who doesnt like it . its fun dude m you gotta like it . dont be a dumby and not like this game .
B00AA0TJO8|2.0|i bought all the colors but the game just would'nt let me have them! the computer game is actually epic.<br />not very good graphics either. not recommended.
B000CNFC76|5.0|This is a super movie! Everything about it is exceptional. I'm not much of a golf fan and while golf is central to the story, that's not all it is. It's about loyalty, realizing dreams, friendship, family values and always doing the very best that you can. Stephen Dillane is superb as usual, so good I thought he was Harry Vardon. Shia LeBeouf plays his role to perfection. Buy it, borrow it or rent it, I guarantee you'll like it.This is a movie that I'll watch more than once.
B00992CF6W|3.0|You need to update it so you can play multiplayer to  find dungeons change skin and mine Redstone<br />I give 3 stars you will get 4 if u update
B004UID2LC|4.0|So I've been viewing the reviews, and nearly all of them are bad! Well i have a kindle fire HD, and it seems to work just fine. It can be a little slow but i haven't received any viruses or things like that.<br /><br />SO I SUGGEST THIS ONLY TO KINDLE OWNERS<br />Just to be safe, i haven't received any problems on my kindle, but I'm not sure on other devices. I absolutely love how you can download and view any you tube videos!
B000VSYDRM|5.0|Ben Wishaw is perfection in this role.  One of the greatest actors of our time.  Definitely not to be missed.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I got this app for my kids because they love the movie. Yet I have become addicted to it. I even prefer it over candy crush. :)
B005KDDUVS|4.0|Cuatro estrellas. No se puede dejar de leer. Carlos Ruiz es un artista en lograr el manejo de los personajes
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I am always reading so have many books to compare.  This one may be the most beautiful and moving book I have ever read.  I laughed, smiled, cried.  So many truths in it.  Never mind the movie--read the book!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|a little hard to follow in the beginning but grabs you and will not let go.  sometimes love is love and sometimes family is all about love
B00BM1AJIO|5.0|I enjoyed this game a lot because in my opinion, it engages you and is not like the typical item searching games. This is the first time i cleared a chapter of such a game  because it was not too complicated to understand and if you were stuck there were always small hints to help you out, though i tried not to use it too often. It was a meaningful game and had a good story behind it. It's a good game.
B0037RDPEG|4.0|I really enjoyed the aspects of self discovery the each environment provided.  I think the book slowed a little in the final part but overall a good holiday read
B00GO95TAC|1.0|Loved seeing the 10th again, but all in all a very disappointing show.  Where is the action?  Where is the suspense??  Can't believe I paid that much for this.
B003KK6GOQ|5.0|It was a very poignant story and I was sorry to see there will be no more from this wonderful author as she passed away. Loved it and will read again and again.
B00FLDG5BE|5.0|I have all the crossroad DVD or blu rays. This is by far the best. If you like great guitar, you won't be disappointed!
1451696191|5.0|One of my favorite books of all time I have read it many times and recently saw the movie. I can easily relate.
1616550414|5.0|Big book in perfect condition with lots of nice picture and text....AWESOME. Just wish it elaborated more on some of the older games.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This game is fun for any age and will keep you wanting more for hours on end. Everyone should have this game
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Best $35 dollars I ever spent. Keeps getting better as more people develop for it! It turns your phone, tablet, or computer into a smart TV remote.
B00B7ERH04|5.0|It offers video and photos. I got it because of the video taping. The kindle fire hd offers a camera for pictures instead of both.<br />It doesn't have 2 cameras so I just turn it around. You can change flim color like, for example it has black/white. You can also change how light or dark it is.<br /><br />It has a thing called Time Lapse and it does the fast video taping. But it has to be under 15 seconds. The regular is 21:69 I think. I know it some where in 21 minutes.You can even send the videos.<br /><br />You video the fun instead of just 1 flim choice, you have dozens. That might b exaggerating a tad. I like to make my on mini movies. I'm not sure if you can post to YouTube. I'll have to look that up.<br /><br />Let your creativity run wild. It's even better, because it's FREE!!!!! Tell your friends, tell your family about this.<br /><br />I recommend this to anyone who wants to video on their kindle fire hd or someone who's very creative. I hope my review helped you:-)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0036S4B6M|3.0|Expected more. Character was very likable. The rest of the inmate's characters seemed quite imbelished. Everyone had a heart of gold and was in prison because of society. Pretty much a Women's Lock-up you would see on MSNBC. Have read better in this genre.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I have played alot of these type games where you build the town and this is one of the best ones yet.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|The book holds my attention and interest.  I thought at first it would be very dull considering it is built around the contesting of a will.  I have thoroughly enjoyed the book and don't want the end to come.
B00E9P959O|5.0|This is definitely a big improvement compared to the original Vapor Trails. I always loved the music on this album, but stopped listening to it because the sound clarity of the original was so poor. On a side note, I had 8th row center at Rush's opening show of the Vapor Trails tour in Hartford, CT back in 2002. That was an unbelievable concert! Sound was perfect as was their performance. I’m so glad they fixed this album! If you love the music on Vapor Trails and feel the original has sound quality issues, pick this up. I believe you’ll be happy that you did.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I am very pleased with the quality of this app. The updates are useful, it's fairly easy to navigate and getting the option to see multiple cities is a plus for traveling!
B003G4W49C|5.0|What I liked about this book was that it always had a secret hidden in the truth like when ender was joining the battle school, they told him that the kid he beat up on earth was only seriously injured, not dead. What i dislike about the book is that we never found out much about Peter or colonel graff or any of his friends. I would recommend this book for people who can keep what each character is up to in there head and when the next time the story continues from there place, they can pick right back up. I would not read it if you don't like when people die. Other wise you should read it . (Special guest review by Evan, 11.)
B008JFURII|3.0|while it has its funnier moments, Red 2 is not as enteraining as the first film. Even with Anthony Hopkins playing the scientist and the older yet very sexy Helen Mirren, The film was still a generic sequel. If u love the first film like i do? Please rent before u buy. Thanx for reading.
B00ENYKBD0|4.0|I have heard people who say that they did not enjoy this movie however, I found it to be very intriguing. Perhaps it is due to the fact that I have a son with different problems yet, he has overcome so many of them. The wife is not as good in the part as Russell Crowe however, the reflection of her devotion to him is overwhelmingly beautiful. If only so many would go the distance with people with problems. That is the true beauty of this movie. We all have special gifts and her devotion to helping him use his is beautiful. There is real kindness in this movie that touches the heart. Oh, how I wish people were more kind.
B004I4H8QS|5.0|The three versions of &#34;Got to get better in a little while&#34; in this package are reason enough to give this  a 5 star review!  Personally one of my favorite Derek and the Dominos song, these versions are superb and &#34;cleaned&#34; up from the bootlegs I heard in the past.  As for the other &#34;extras&#34;, I really recommend this to all.
B000JIHP88|5.0|Great mobile. The kids loves it even after 3 years. Music is soft and good for bedtime and the rotating toys is fun for the babies, toddlers and kids. Recommended.
B0000CFW87|5.0|Special song on the album.  My husband loved the song, &#34;You Raise Me Up&#34; so that is why I purchased this CD.
1449305172|5.0|I love the way Ash approaches how we should reach early adopters with his price techniques and it's a must read to compare with Steve Blanks methodologies!
B007FROGME|1.0|This book is well written but it was too depressing and in parts too graphic for me, not a holiday read!
1451648545|5.0|I've almost finished reading this book and I couldn't put it down once I started it. Great reference material. Isaacson appears neutral in relaying an enormous amount of information over a long period of time. I am now more able to grasp what Apple has been about and feel much more comfortable going forward.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love this calculator.  The numbers are large making it so easy to use.  Highly recommend it.  As the old saying goes, &quot;try it, you'll love it&quot;
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|She describes her beliefs and culture. She is committed to improving the lives of the women in her country as well as the poor class there. I am learning so much from her and appreciating America more because of this book.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great graphics, easy to learn and the minions are hysterical! I'm 38 and am no gamer. But this one just caught my eye.  Great choice for my first game! I'm hooked!
0385338600|4.0|Very fast read so far.  Although some of the situations are troubling even today.  A lesson in courtroom procedure and how the system works or did.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Great personal story between Ender, his family and friends.  Ender is thrust into a world of combat and has to adjust from a boy to growing up in a world of combat.  He wants to keep his friends and family, but realizes he has to sacrifice a lot of himself in order to save the world.

B004Q7CIFI|5.0|This story is a time travel Odyssey, a Greek tragedy, and a hero who wanders, suffers, and struggles. as the reader questions, &#34;Will he return home?&#34;  Those familiar with Greek myth should take note that King's describes the young girls in this story who skip rope as &#34;the Greek chorus.&#34;  The name of the hero  is &#34;Jacob&#34; (the wrestler) and his hubris is evident at the beginning as he sees himself as the only one who can save JFK; transformation occurs as the tragedies unfold.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|WOULD like to be able to play this game without having to spend real money.I know it is free to play but it really is not if you can not progress with real money being spent. Apart from that a God game to while away the hours.
0374104093|4.0|Book Info: Genre: Psychological thriller (Per publisher); Lovecraftian fiction (per me)<br />Reading Level: Adult<br />Recommended for: Fans of Lovecraftian stories, surreal or bizarro fiction<br />Book Available: February 4, 2014 in paperback, Kindle, and audiobook formats<br />Trigger Warnings: killing, mind control, murder, attempted murder<br /><br />My Thoughts: An early reader of this book described it as, “A little Kubrick, a lot Lovecraft...” and who could resist that juicy plum? I'm not sure what genre to put this in, however. While it is dark fantasy, it is also very gritty and “real” in many places. Any elements of magical realism are subtle and maybe the result of an unreliable narrator. Or maybe not. Maybe these things really are happening. The problem is that everything seems almost dream-like in many places.<br /><br />The Lovecraft comes about through the slow, creeping weirdness that gradually ramps up into more and more weirdness as the story continues. The plot is very surreal in many places. If a person isn't a fan of Lovecraftian fiction and/or bizarro or surreality, then they probably will not enjoy this story. However, if you take the time to focus and follow along, you will find yourself in a very interesting place. I, for one, will definitely be watching for the rest of this trilogy, to find out what happens, because it's just such a cool idea. I can't give you any details about the story as it would be very easily spoiled. But if you like Lovecraftian, surreal or bizarro fiction, then check this book out.<br /><br />Series Information: The Southern Reach Trilogy<br />Book 1: Annihilation , available February 4, 2014<br />Book 2: Authority, available June, 2014<br />Book 3: Acceptance, available September, 2014<br /><br />Disclosure: I received a paperback ARC from the Amazon Vine program in exchange for an honest review. All opinions are my own.<br /><br />Synopsis: Area X has been cut off from the rest of the continent for decades. Nature has reclaimed the last vestiges of human civilization. The first expedition returned with reports of a pristine, Edenic landscape; all the members of the second expedition committed suicide; the third expedition died in a hail of gunfire as its members turned on one another; the members of the eleventh expedition returned as shadows of their former selves, and within months of their return, all had died of aggressive cancer.<br /><br />This is the twelfth expedition.<br /><br />Their group is made up of four women: an anthropologist; a surveyor; a psychologist, the de facto leader; and our narrator, a biologist. Their mission is to map the terrain and collect specimens; to record all their observations, scientific and otherwise, of their surroundings and of one another; and, above all, to avoid being contaminated by Area X itself.<br /><br />They arrive expecting the unexpected, and Area X delivers—they discover a massive topographic anomaly and life forms that surpass understanding—but it’s the surprises that came across the border with them, and the secrets the expedition members are keeping from one another, that change everything.Nature has reclaimed the last vestiges of human civilization.

B00C8S9VKM|2.0|It just isn't as interesting or as well written as I expected. Yes, it was an exciting summer but this is a slow read that I WILL get through.
B0081336FO|5.0|Fun does not begin to truly describe the series. Outstanding settings and photography. Story lines are original with a hint to Conan Doyle's writings. I was leary at first, being that to me Basil Rathbone was the genuine Holmes, but I was very pleasantly surprised by the team of Cumberbatch and Freeman; their chemistry is seductive and the stories captivating. Cudos all around.
B0025UHKNS|3.0|While we love the features of this watch and the accompanying website, the battery died in it after just over a year.  We got little satisfaction from Garmin, they would sell us a reconditioned one if we returned it.  We found a place online to replace the battery and it worked again, for a while.  When it quit working again, we tried everything recommended and no luck.  Then we dropped it by accident on a hard floor and it started working again.  Maybe I should have dropped it earlier!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this game but I wish they would make it to were you can buy diamonds with coins that you earn in the game.  So I give it 4 1/2 out of 5
B00FAI2IUM|5.0|Fun love it get it although it a little hard to get cars it is still awesome<br />Get it now.
0061122416|3.0|The story itself was good but I think that the writing was pedantic and I do not understand why it is considered one of the best. Maybe something was lost in translation
B00DVKOYBM|4.0|Descent physics and like Playin live opponents plus the reward system is cool. Only thing is server is a bit sketch... mine goes in and out from time to time.
B0046B3QTG|5.0|The minions were funny, I wish I had some. This was good enough for me to grab my Nephew as an excuse to watch part 2.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Fun to pass time<br />Great way to stay busy and sometimes very challenging. Jewel star 2is a great sequel. Fun for any part of the family
B002WY65VU|4.0|It was a good, funny look at how to survive a zombie apocalypse and it has Bill Murray. What more could you need?
B00887490Y|2.0|If I could give the ending zero stars, I would; that's how disgusted I was by it.  The sad thing is I loved the first three quarters of the movie.  It was sad and spooky and scary.  Jessica Biel plays Julia Denning, a nurse and widowed mother in a small, down on its luck mining town.  Her husband was THE respected town doctor and she is trying, mostly in vain, to earn the love of the community that he had.<br />Over several months, more than a dozen of the town's children have vanished without a trace.  People are blaming a local urban legend called the Tall Man, whom they say is the devil himself.<br />When Julia sees a shadowed tall man take her son, David, it starts her on a thrilling chase to get him back.  This is where the movie makes several exciting plot twists that had me on the edge of my seat.  Is there really a Tall Man?  Is there a conspiracy of silence in the town?  Is Julia really David's mother?<br />Up to this point, I was thinking, what a great movie this is.  Then the big reveal...ruined everything.  I'm sorry, but I cannot accurately explain my disgust of the ending without spoiling it, so if you haven't seen the movie, STOP HERE.<br />Where do the writers/producers/director get off saying that rich people are naturally better parents than poor people just because they have more money?  How dare they justify torturing these poor people, who love their children as much as anyone else, by stealing them and giving them to rich people?  By the end, I was insulted beyond belief.  i hated it, hated it!
1609611543|5.0|So much information about such important subjects.  Love the recipes and the common sense stories.  Highly recommend to anyone wondering why they can't lose weight.
B00BT1XCOU|5.0|Just finished this season and can't wait for season 9!! I love how in one episode I can cry and laugh at the same time!!
B004MC0FO8|3.0|OK on blockbuster tunes but often fails to recognise non-US artists or has false results. Particularly inaccurate in recognising lyrics.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Read some of the neg reviews. It is absolutely free. I have have made it to the 4th of 5 regions without paying a dime. It's called perseverance & patience. Eventually you get it. Kind of like a certain candy game many people pay for extras on instead of just sticking with a level until you win it. Some said it takes forever for energy to refill. It's just over an hour, and it takes me quite a while to run out in the first place. When I do, I quit. It's called \\"do something else\\". An hour is forever? How old are these people, 4? This game is great. It's very fun! Fantastic graphics for a free game.  Highly impressed.<br /><br />UPDATE: Do not bother buying an assault rifle. You do not need one, ignore their \\"recommendations\\". I am nearly done with region 4 and have never used the one I wasted my in game (not real money) money on. A rifle works fine.
B008J2GAKU|3.0|It's okay but a kindle is not a good way to read a Batman comic book. After all the years I am still a fan of Batman. But as I said a Kindle doesn't do justice to the drawings
B004J4WN0I|4.0|I enjoyed the fast pace of this book. it was easy to get caught up in the story and I enjoyed the world.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game so much it is so fun you can craft armour and craft tools there are zombies,creepers,and spiders and skeletons
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Amazing book. I absolutely loved it! I was a lot better than I had expected it to be and that's saying a lot. Veronica Roth did a wonderful job writing the final book in the Divergent Trilogy.
B0035LMTZA|3.0|Sort of a sequil and somewhat contrived.  Good fun and worth watching.  Video quality is excellent. Great scenery and mostly decent acting.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I can't wait until the update that has the battle dragons arena. I really think they should work on that. But of course we just wait like you wait for Dragon to hatch or evolve. This game is all about patience.
B002RCEBBI|4.0|In 2009, the Progressive Metal scene wasn't offering me much. Then I picked this album up, merely trying out this band. The music on here is extremely well done and the vocals; oh my God the vocals are AMAZING!!!! Simone Simons has a beautiful voice and Mark Jansen has some really good growls. The guitars are very technical and well-done and the drums are incredible! This band has some great musicians!<br /><br />The music:<br /><br />1. Samadhi (Prelude)- A nice orchestral intro to the album. Not much to say about it. It sounds pretty cool.<br /><br />2. Resign to Surrender: A New Age Dawns, Part IV- This song picks up right after the previous track ends and it's got some good stuff! The opening riffing is pretty chill and then it gets into it! It turns into a wild guitar-driven jam with integrated orchestral work, pounding drums, and other awesome stuff. Simone's vocals here are amazing! Mark drives the song more, but when Simone makes an appearance, it's extremely epic! This is probably my favorite track along with the next song, Unleashed. The guitar solo in this song is also top notch as well! I read one review that said this is the first Epica album to feature guitar solos. Well in that case, you can't get better than this if it's the first guitar solo by this band! It rocks! This song is a perfect balance of heaviness and beauty. AWESOME song! LOVE IT!<br /><br />3. Unleashed- This song starts off with a dark choir and some epic sounding drums and then BOOM! It goes into a rather heavy, yet melodic jam with some extra layering by the orchestra. The verses have a really good driving beat and Simone sounds awesome still! Most bands I've heard that do the symphonic metal style lack in the metal part; they do rock beats and guitar parts and have more focus on the symphonic elements. Not Epica! This song clearly demonstrates how masterfully they can integrate an orchestra into a metal song and keep it metal! This is a top notch song and it's the one that persuadedme to buy this album! The guitar parts in this song are no joke and the drumming isn't either. This band is really technical, yet Simone and the orchestras add the emotion to the music that gives it life and clarity. Really good song!<br /><br />4. Martyr of the Free Word- This song hits you like a train at the beginning. It starts off with some extremely heavy and in-yo-face riffing and just when you think it'll intensify more, it goes in to a really atmospheric, grooving, softer verse. It has some Indian-sounding melodies and sounds mixed with some chugging riffs and then it goes into a pretty cool chorus. Then after the chorus it bursts into some heavy stuff yet again! It comes out of nowhere! It really changes up on you and that's why I love progressive metal! Great song!<br /><br />5. Our Destiny- This song starts off with some guitar chords and orchestral stuff. Then it turns into Simone singing over a piano part and then some drums join in. The guitars join in and it becomes a pretty interesting piece of music. It's a really good song, but it's hard to describe. I really enjoy this song though! It's got a little for everyone in it! Nice one!<br /><br />6. Kingdom of Heaven: A New Age Dawns, Part V- If you think the name is long, the song is even longer at 13:34. Now, the length of the song is not an issue for me, it's just that too much of it is boring. I mean it's a good song, but it doesn't appeal to me except for the last 4(isn) minutes of it. Other than those last 4 minutes, it's not really great for me. It's not the fact that it's dominated by Mark's growls for most of it, it's just that it's not appealing to me. I can't really call out anything specific.<br /><br />7. The Price of Freedom (Interlude)- A cool piano and orchestral interlude that leads into the following track<br /><br />8. Burn to a Cinder- This song starts off right where the interlude leaves off. It's got a heavy, dark groove opening it up and then the verse has some vocals that bringArabian melodies to mind. This song is really heavy and grooving, but it's also really beautiful because of Simone's vocals. This song has some very atmospheric passages that really bring out the beauty of Simone's vocals. I'd have to name this song a favorite of mine as well. It remains heavy throughout the song, yet it has immense beauty in some parts of it. It's also extremely progressive so that's a plus. The solo in this song is extremely emotional and gives the song something more! A very good song!<br /><br />9. Tides of Time- This song is extremely BEAUTIFUL! This one is soft and entirely Simone's song. It's kept really simple for most of it; piano and orchestra parts underneath Simone's vocals. Words really can't describe this song. It sounds like something that could've easily come off of a soundtrack and this song would be quite awesome on a soundtrack too! There are some really operatic vocals on here! Beautiful song! One of the album's strongest points IF not THE strongest! The guitar solo on here is extremely good! I'd compare it to an Evergrey solo, which is the HIGHEST praise I can give a guitar soloist! Evergrey's solos may not be extremely technical, but the level of emotion is untouchable by many, but this song manages to do it. Incredible!<br /><br />10. Deconstruct- This song starts off with a happy sounding orchestra and then a happier sounding jam starts. Then it becomes more epic. I do quite enjoy the guitar parts in the verse. They groove extremely well and the drumming is awesome! The guy changes on a dime! The chorus of this song is very layered and features vocals from both Mark and Simone! It took a while for this song to grow on me, but it did. Good song!<br /><br />11. Semblance of Liberty- This song is heavier than most of the other songs. While the intro sounds pretty cool, this is one of those songs that doesn't really appeal to me as much. There isn't really much wrong with it, in fact nothing is wrong with it. It just doesn't interest me. Not a bad track though. Maybe it'll grow on me in the future.<br /><br />12. White Waters- This one starts off pretty simple on the guitar. Then some really beautiful orchestral stuff comes in and then the guitars start to sound more mystic rather than beautiful. As one other reviewer said, the male vocals on this song could've been done much better. The song isn't bad at all, but Tony Kakko's vocals aren't that good. Personally, if I could've made the choice for them, I would've said Tom Englund (Evergrey) or Russell Allen (Symphony X). The vocals of Tony in this song lack inspiration and emotion. That is the only thing that kills this song. Could've been better.<br /><br />13. Deign Your Universe: A New Age Dawns, Part IV- This song has a haunting and beautiful intro. It then begins to become darker and build up. When the whole band comes in the guitars jam out and then it becomes soft with Simone singing over some softer grooving music. Then Mark comes in and the music becomes heavier. This song is very well-done. The chorus with the choir is fantastic! It really adds to the song! The best part of the song is from after the second chorus to the end. The music becomes extremely epic and it gives a similar vibe as track 2. It even has the same melody to tie the ending of the album to the beginning. This track is a monstrosity of awesome music! It's such a great way to end the album! Love it!<br /><br />Verdict- This is a really good album and I recommend it to fans of prog acts such as Dream Theater, Symphony X, and Evergrey, and even to fans of heavier, melodic death metal acts like In Flames, Sonic Syndicate, and Mercenary. It's filled with lots of technical stuff for the prog fans and loads of heavy, melodic riffs for those who like the Gothenburg sound! Buy it! It's worth it!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Like but what I want are wolves and other things xD it's cool but they should add the nether my brother and sister play it alto t that I can't even play.
B005S9EKCW|1.0|This was one of the most insufferable film experiences of my life (and I've seen some bad films, believe me). Russell Crowe is ludicrous, and the rest of the cast merely adequate. I saw Les Miserables on stage back in the mid-nineties, and that's where this musical belongs - on stage. Sheer torture.
0399246665|5.0|Gives my child lots to look at and we can create stories with each book perfect to help her enjoy and learn

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love,love,love this game! I can't wait till I have  more lives to play! Only one thing I have to say negative is too long to wait for lives,  and no free ones??
B007BT0RKG|4.0|This was useful on a long trip when we didn't have maps of all the states. Every night I would download the next days' state(s) and then when we were on the road we had a reference.
B0089LOG02|3.0|Started off brilliantly, with good potential.  As the story unravelled, there was a sense that the author was becoming impatient to get finished; certain aspects of the story were disappointingly summarised.  Additionally, I felt that the two principle characters' link developed unrealistically and the younger main character changed her personality dramatically with little evidence of justification.  Generally, an ok read, but dont expect too much from it. . .
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|Was so happy I was finally able to get this app on my kindle but I don't like that I have to wait to get more lives once I use the ones I have.  Sometimes have to wait close to half an hour just to play.  Also don't like that every so often I have to do quests and there are 3 of them and I can only complete one every 24 hours.  Not fun!  I have gotten Fruit Drops for free and bought fruit Drops 2 and it is so much better than this.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|this book is amazing and heartwarming. it really shows the importance of friends, family, and life. i cried at the end!! i definately recommend this book for ages 13 and up.
B008KX96OK|5.0|I loved the poetic language of the chiefs, and the dignity they showed.  The photographs bring to life the story, and emphasize just how recently this tragedy happened.  Every school should have a copy.

B00GT4V5DM|5.0|It works with very low overhead yet it performs exactly as described. Easy to use and very unobtrusive.  Definitely a keeper
B006YB9VJU|5.0|Life easier<br />  Sony Xperia NFC Smart Tags is simply makes your life easier<br />One used in the home , another in my office and another in my car<br />When I ride my car I don't need to be busy with phone and associate it with Bluetooth system in my car or open applications ,  all done by just passing my mobile over Tags<br /><br />I recommend it to use for those who want to customize the settings or applications  in specific places

B000OZ0NXA|4.0|This was a great start to the Jack Reacher series. I just finished and  have already downloaded the second book.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey is a great series.  We have watched Season 1 & 2 and now have seen three episodes of Season 3 and look forward to the remaining episodes.  Highly recommend it.
B00GLX1MG6|4.0|We're the Millers was exactly as expected. Funny, but not hilarious. Entertaining, but not an award winner. Worth a rental
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|Absolutely amazing!  I bought this album late, hard to spend the $ sometimes.  I had heard the popular songs on the radio and TV, almost to the point of being sick of them.  The secret with Mumford & Sons is in the songs the radio doesn't play.  Every song on this album is great.  I can't choose the better of the albums, Sigh No More was excellent as well!  If you haven't purchased either, start with the first.  Mumford brings emotion and power, as well as message.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|its an okay game. its just making me download it again and again! i dont know i might just delete it.
B00003OO3O|5.0|ufo were one of the best hard rock bands of all time.  That's a fact. And they still make good cds. Although the last two were more bluesy than  earlier efforts. They both still rock. But this is from another era!. And ufo were at the peak of their powers here. Songs like 'this kids' , 'mother mary' ,  'shoot shoot' and others stand the test of time as real classic metal or hard rocks songs. Ufo started out as a late sixties acid rock (another form of metal really) band.  By this time they were a full on hard rock monster of a band. WIth incredible songs and guitar playing.By this time the acid rock days were far behind them and they were creating well crafted and wonderful hard rockers and ballads too.  My version of this has plenty of extra tracks on it. Get that one because if you are going to buy or download a great disc you might as well get the bonus tracks too.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|80% into the book, I began crying. I didn't stop until a half an hour after I finished it. If that isn't a good indicator of how much this book can touch you, I don't know what is.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Heartwarming!!! I book that should be read by the young hearted and those seasoned in life.  Palacio receives a standing ovation!!
B00GH4RKYM|2.0|I get the idea that Superman is, on some level, an &#34;alien invasion story,&#34; and the movie's asctetics are great, but I found the plot wanting, and the action rediculously over the top.  There were elements and nuances that were added that, to me, undermine the majesty of Superman's American identity and midwest origins.  While it's a good action movie, it falls short of being a great movie, or even a great superhero movie becuase it doesn't respect the origin or the years of evolution the character went through on the page.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|It has all been said, but once more-this isa marvelous reworking of some of the best music ever. Unexpected transitions, a reasonably broad representation of their whole spectrum, and a fantastic pairing with the cirque show.  Fun.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|I like to game, but prefer Bejeweled 2.  I unwind in the evening before bedtime and play this game a couple of times, soon after I fall asleep.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|I love this game. I play it all the time and it feels like I am really controlling my robot against other people's robot.
B00632HWOG|5.0|My favorite email and very convenient much better than the traditional Yahoo.  Easier to maneuver while checking your email and folders.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love Candy Crush, I can play for hours. It is very challenging in the higher levels. I get frustrated when I can't get passed certain levels but I can't stop playing!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Don't play this game before bedtime it will keep your mind too active.  I tried it and keep falling off the cliff, lol.  It is interesting and take some time getting use to it.  I am not a game person, but was told as a senior you need to keep your mind sharp.
B000FA675C|5.0|Have read Dan Brown's books and enjoy the thrilling mysteries.  There is always lots of action in his books. Well known.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Its so great to go back where it all started with jake brigance in clanton mississippi 3 years after the infamous hailey trial. Only grisham can make a civil trial over a will so interesting!! Couldnt put it down. 5 stars all the way!!
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|Did not play quickly.  Just sat there.  Waste of time. Uninstalled it.  Good graphics and maybe ok for faster processor than my 1st gen kindle fire.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Awesome game and plenty of fun. I can't put it down. My first time trying it out was very easy to use and my friends downloaded it too because I recommended it for the fun to play it.
1250038820|5.0|I follow HONY online and had to have Brandon's first book.  Beautiful photos.  He's made some great selections, and with his extensive collection, that must not have been easy.  He seems to have a knack for running into the most amazing people in the middle of the street, but they're really just all of us.  Pretty cool.
B00004KD1A|5.0|What can be said about ANY Rory Gallagher live album that hasn't already been said?  This is high energy rock at its finest and if you play this while driving on the freeway/motorway, you'll be so overtaken by the energy on this disc that you might find yourself speeding! Yes,its that infectious!<br /><br />The guitar solos are top notch and the songs are portrayed in a fun and free mentality. Really,its a party and because its a live album,it comes with its own party-goers!

B008Y7N7JW|4.0|The movie is pretty close to the book, and quite engaging, too. Good acting, and very convincing. It's a reflection of our society, with all its materialism at the expense of others.

B003G4W49C|3.0|I read a lot of sci fi but this one was just OK.  There was no variation in action, progress of the story, and no explanation of how the children could be so advanced.  I thought the forward was bragging.  Not a waste of time but I was not unhappy to have it end.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I enjoy the challenge. Since I don't do facebook at a roadblock.<br />If I figure it out will continue on.

B008H7HE9S|4.0|This is good music to dance to and sing out loud to. Loved most of the songs. Thanks for making a clean version.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is absolutely fantastic and one of the best I've ever read (I read like  obsessively, trust me)<br />I am the kind of person who doesn't cry much during books.<br />But I have to say, The Fault In Our Stars is a must-read that I was unable to take my eyes off of until 1:48 in the morning. I could relate to Hazel, Augustus, and Mr. I Always Forget His Name. I was crying from about mid-way through to the end of it, stopping ok once because I had to brush my teeth. I am going to be so tired tomorrow (Thanksgiving) but this book was worth it. And now let me go off on a tangent about how awesome Augustus is: ack he's just so witty and everything and clever and charismatic and I don't even know what that means don't judge me I'm only 12 but charismatic sounds good so I'll use it to describe him. Ack I need to go cry now because just ack just ack

B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|What a great Myst-like game! Full of unconventional puzzles which require observation instead of reflexes. I'm looking forward to the next one.
B00AQL8VU4|5.0|I purchases a tablet that isn't compatible with the Google Play Store and I was literally tramping through every website for a way to get some games and this helpful person said Amazon. I knew about Amazon before but I didn't know it had an app so i downloaded it and made an account. After that, the rest was history. I found amazing games and its just really helpful. I can't even express it in any other words.
B00GM9Q9U8|3.0|I liked this movie and was drawn in by the trailer. There is not a lot of action, but the few fight scenes were pretty good. It is more a biography than anything else. I probably would have gave it four stars, but it was just not as good as Ip Man and Ip Man 2.
B009XHAM8G|5.0|My niece loves this book and my parents read this story alot more when my nephew was a baby :)
B003O85W44|2.0|This review isn't about the music - this album is one of my favorites and if we're talking about just the music, this album would get five stars from me.  This review is about the vinyl.  Two main issues I have with it.  1) the recording/mastering/whatever just doesn't sound that great on vinyl.  It's kind of muddy.  2) and this is the bigger issue, twice in a row I've gotten defective vinyl.  The first order came through with one of the platters warped - warped enough to hear the pitch variations in playback.  Amazon of course handled the exchange flawlessly and I had a replacement sent to my door by 1-day delivery.  The replacement isn't warped.  It's flat as a pancake.  Unfortunately, side 2 of the 2nd LP was pressed so far off-center that there's huge wow & flutter pitch variations during playback.  It's unlistenable.<br /><br />Merge Records, get with the program!  It's 2013.  The techniques for properly pressing vinyl records should be well-understood by now.  Granted, getting a warped record may not be a manufacturing issue.  Could have been shipped/stored improperly, whatever.  But an off-center pressing is definitely a manufacturing issue.<br /><br />I've ordered a bunch of vinyl from Amazon in the last few weeks and the only records I've had problems with have been on Merge (the other was Kaputt by Destroyer - also arrived badly warped and had to be returned.  Thankfully, the replacement album was defect-free).<br /><br />I think this time I'll return the LP for refund rather than exchange.  If it was a great recording I'd try again but this recording, as pressed, doesn't really allow the full glory of vinyl to shine.  I'd say stick with the CD or digital download for this album.  Definitely buy this album; I'm just not sure you should buy it on vinyl.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is great! It'll teach kids pet care skills and time management. My Horse is fun to play, educational, and simply beautiful! 5 of 5 stars! A+++
B00992CF6W|5.0|Very awsome game I have 0.8.0 already awsome minecraft redstone<br /><br />But slot of bugs to fix there is 3d clouds
B004SXKRQC|1.0|I have to use captions on most movies.  Although this movie has captions, they are 20 to 30 seconds after the dialog which makes them useless.  I became so frustrated that I stopped watching this movie on Amazon Instant Video and rented it on iTunes where the captions were done right.<br /><br />I have complained and asked Amazon for a refund but there has been no response.  Because of this incident, I think I am done using Amazon Instant Video
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Wonderful game.  I loved it on my phone and it is even better on the big screen of my kindle.  Download this game and you will not be disappointed.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Lots of fun and strategy in this game. Hours of play. I do find myself wishing bad things for the residents of Greenland as a side effect, though. Those people just WILL NOT DIE, darnit!
B003V1WXKU|3.0|Written by a Nobel-prize winning physicist, this book is a curious mixture of different elements. Parts of it, focusing on the author's various pranks, consist of childish boasting. Some parts, especially those in which he tries to impress readers with the supposed superiority of the scientific view of the world, are simply foolish. And parts, especially those in which he explains what looking for the truth feels like, are magnificent, almost sublime.<br /><br />Briefly, a so-so performance. From a man with Feynman's reputation, one would have expected more.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|I like it but it always logs me out and starts me over all the time. I recemend that you don't do much when you play or some will get dileted.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|The graphics is very good. It's fun to play to higher level with higher challenge. But the program asked for too much money. Should be one purchase to have something for all level instead of each level.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works perfectly with easy setup. connection is about 15 feet away, and there is no problem. I highly recommend it .

B00ELE8D4Q|5.0|Cher really pulls out all the stops with \\"Closer To The Truth.\\" Her voice is in excellent form and so many of the songs are deliciously wonderful--on the deluxe Target version, I'm deeply in love with a full nine songs: Woman's World, Take It Like A Man, Dressed To Kill, I Walk Alone, I Hope You Find It, I Don't Sleep To Dream, Pride, You Haven't Seen The Last of Me, and Wait For Me. This excellent, substantial album shows Cher at the height of her powers, which considering how long she's been with us, and how many other amazing things she's done with her career, is remarkable. Special notice goes to Dressed to Kill--a fabulous song which should have an incredible montage when Cher takes this music on the road!!! It's been a while since I've loved a CD as much as I love this one.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I love Ender's Game. I've read it through twice now and can never get over how he evolves! Orson Scott Card did a wonderful job on this classic of a novel
B00F0O8SZK|5.0|everything that Susan Boyle sings makes a person realize that they can attain their dreams if they perservere. Not to mention her singing is who she really is and the albums are soothing!

B004Z2TUGE|4.0|Although this movie lacked some detail and back story, it was a good movie that I enjoyed. The action is nice, with humor, and even a love interest. I recommend it for anyone who likes the super hero kind of feel to a movie.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really nice graphics. Puzzles are tough but not too hard -- just the right balance for challenging fun. Music is enjoyable background. It's very much like one of those old adventure games you'd see on PCs. . (Anyone else remember Hugo's House of Horrors?)  Or sort of Myst-lite. Game play perfectly suited to my 7\\" kindle fire .Would love to see more of/like this. Developers did a great job.
B00GH4R95C|5.0|This was one of the best movies I've seen all year. Was an excellent, modern remake of the classic superman movie. I woiuld watch this over and over again, and I don't say that about many movies. This one is sure worth the buy!

B00EJU8ZIG|5.0|WOW. Lorde would fit right in if she was making music in the 90s. It's refreshing to see an artist make music not soley for money or fame. You can feel her passion. The problem with most artists today is that it is all about money, fame, and girls. You see them in commercials, ads, products, etc. I guess these are the times we live in.
B00F0O8SZK|5.0|I'm an avid music lover and vocalist and Susan Boyle has a beautiful voice and I enjoy emulating her singing!
1451666179|5.0|I love Allie Brosch. I really appreciate her description of the struggle with depression. I would recommend it just on that merit alone, but wish more of her comic stories had been included. Fortunately, \\"The God of Cake,\\" \\"The Party,\\" as well as, \\"Simple Dog,\\" are included.<br /><br />Fair warning: my daughter and I laughed 'til we cried, and most I've shared with laughed out loud more than once, but my husband asked, \\"is this supposed to be funny?\\"  With Allie B., you either think she's hilarious, or you don't get it. Also, although she is very intelligent and a bit of a grammar snob, she swears alot (sic.)
B009NXV2RK|5.0|The story is gripping, so many twists..one can not guess as they read as to what lay ahead.<br /><br />Tom Clancy classic again only he can do this over and over again.

B00GHJ6BJW|5.0|Lady Gaga continues to be one of the most innovative and interesting musicians of today. This album, while it does go in a different direction from her previous work, still showcases her amazing musical ability. This is an amazing dance record. There is not one song worth skipping.
B003E6LC6I|3.0|This Season II was not as well written as Season I. I hope that Season III will be better. Still worth viewing and its free as a prime member.

0783225482|5.0|This is a very clever film made into a unreal story.  The acting on everybody's part is extraordinary.  The humor<br />that exists in this fictional story is what makes the film.<br />A true delight.<br />Thank you
B005MHHREI|2.0|I read Wild swans and thus bought this book immediately when finished. The content is interesting and tells the untold story of who Mao was really. Yet after just a few chapters i abandoned the book as it becomes too descriptive, like an encyclopedia.not easy to read

B00632HWOG|1.0|The &#34;new&#34; yahoo mail stinks! There's not one change they've made that I feel is an improvement. What the hell kind of beta testing did they do with this? I didn't get one single mail or survey asking me what, if anything, I wanted changed about it. I don't have a single friend who likes the new mail at all! I've even heard that they can't even get their employees to use it!<br /><br />Here's a simple fix, just give us the option to go back to the old email!!!! Won't cost you squat and will make users happy. If I didn't have ten years of archived emails I'd be looking for something else.....unfortunately Gmail already made all the lousy changes that YM just did so they both stink,, gmail actually worse than YM in my opinion. Shame it has to be a competition of who's worst, not who's best!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Not a literary masterpiece but will definitely hold your interest! I did look forward to going back to my reading!
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|Though the subject matter was very depressing, the story was told in a well performed manner. I would recomend this to any Denzel fan.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I probably shouldn't be writing this review immediately after reading this book, but Kindle prompted me to so here I am. I have never felt more miserable after reading a book in my life. Huge tears,and snotty cries, but it's a good miserable. The kind that tells me I can still feel, and that I might have gained something from this book. I think that everyone should take the time to read it. It's worth every snotty tear.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Another great read!  Grisham has completely enveloped me in this court room drama. I was truly mesmerized by the legal protocol and it's limits and excesses. Jake was believable as a moral man first and truth seeker second.
193700788X|1.0|I think the last Sookie Stackhouse book I read and actually enjoyed was Dead and Gone. After that it feels like the series went downhill tremendously, especially after True Blood decided to stray even farther from the series in order to recreate it's own interpretation about the adventures in Bon Temps only to, excuse my language, screw it up. If I pretended the fairies never existed I could stomach the show for an hour a week and retreat into the original universe within the pages whenever I pleased. The plot's decline has been less than comforting over the years and this final installment just left me cold.<br /><br />****SPOILERS INCOMING****<br /><br />I hesitated for several months before purchasing this novel but curiosity finally got the better of me. I knew something was wrong when I saw the book wasn't in first person anymore. The idea that Eric and Sookie's relationship, after being tested again many times over in nearly every book, to suddenly end on a sour note boggles my mind. This man has sacrificed his life, his business, his reputation, his freedom, and the life of his most treasured prot&eacute;g&eacute; to keep Sookie breathing and safe. It may have taken her a while to realize how much work he put into keeping them together, but their ties went beyond blood. That being said, watching their relationship become virtually non-existent in this novel was extremely frustrating to read. In the last few books, Sookie carries on endlessly about how she misses Eric, and yet when he can steal away time to come see her, she's too angry or too tired to give him more than a few moments of her presence.<br /><br />Now this novel has the audacity to demonize his character in some bogus secret plot to keep other men from Sookie while he spends the rest of his existence in vampire wedlock? I've never been more insulted as a reader in my life! After all Eric has done to safeguard her life, does Sookie try to find a way to save him? Does she utilize her wide range ofsupernatural resources to help? Nope, she just checks her email and reads a book whilst daydreaming about babies.<br /><br />Sookie revisits all her past and potential lovers in some sort of &#34;who's she gonna pick?&#34; parade. It's disgustingly obvious from the beginning removing any and all suspense factors from the story. It makes no sense for a person, who has been 100% friend zoned throughout the entire book series to suddenly become our heroines ideal man. The sheer thought of it is a contradiction of every bit of Sookie's character in the first five novels.<br /><br />I'm disappointed as fan and long-time reader of this series. I've watched the characters I've grew to love and admire be written out and killed off inharmoniously. Now the ones who remain are stuck in an irreversible fate while Sookie walks off into the sunset with her new dog. I remember the days when I used to speed through these novels in a matter of hours. This one took over a month with moderate effort to make myself sit down and finish it. In the end, it wasn't worth it.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Right on time. I came across this book while taking heed to a series of omens myself. Having finished the book I am even more certain that this is absolutely so. This book has put into words so many things/circumstances/feelings I have felt and experienced in my own life, figuratively speaking. Things spoken of in this book I do believe to be true and I needed a reminder such as this. The book/story line focused on things I don't want to ever lose sight of. It's just a great book, I really can't articulate it as well as I would like to in this moment, I've gotten such a rush...
B008602KQI|5.0|loved the trilogy and was nervous about seeing how it would translate to film.  i was pleasantly surprised at how well it was adapted.
B004NSZIXO|5.0|This has been my travel companion from and to work for several weeks and i'm still not tired of it!  5 CDs and narration so good I am sad when I loan them out.  Actually have purchased 3 sets because the ones I loan don't come back!!
B00FAVRHBE|5.0|OK, deep breath...let's take a time-out, folks.  If you've got a problem with Amazon's pricing take it up with them personally via e-mail or phone call.  Please, do not...I repeat...do not harm a product's review scoring because you're upset over a price change.  Giving a poor 'star review' based on Amazon's pricing is not a good idea.  Not only will you 'not' get Amazon's attention in doing so, but you'll hurt the success of the product you may actually love.<br /><br />For future reference...If you like a product, rate it well.  If you dislike a product rate it poorly.  If you dislike a price, feel fee to mention it within the written review and then contact Amazon directly.  The star rating, however, simply is not the place to take out your pricing frustration.  It's not.<br /><br />P.S.  This special was fantastic!
B00CVQYMB4|5.0|So inspiring...a must have for anyone trying to improve themselves, and the life around them. Thank you, Thank you Rhonda Byrne!

B00BAXFECK|5.0|Imagine a first chapter written by J. D. Salinger and directed by Wes Anderson, and a climax written by Martin McDonough and directed by Quentin Tarantino. Imagine, instead, a great sprawling contemporary Dickensian confection, with equal parts Nicholas Nickleby, Great Expectations and Curiosity Shop. The Goldfinch is all of these and more
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Truly a masterpiece. I laughed, I cried, and I screamed Murica'! I really enjoyed the sociopolitical elements that helped keep the story somewhat grounded in reality. This is undoubtedly the most realistic portrayal of a zombie apocalypse that I have seen to date.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Every word is like music. There is a pice of every human being in this lovely story. Everyone should read this. Especially those who love to walk, and those who never do.
B00ERIUO02|5.0|I never really paid much attention to Katy Perry. I basically wrote her off as strictly kid's stuff and assumed she'd never outlast the puberty of her fan base. What caught my attention about this new album first was actually the cover and the photo shoot associated with it. I saw less makeup and the cotton candy dress code totally nixed. I thought &#34;hey what's going on here?&#34; I've always thought she was a very attractive woman underneath all the plastic and paint. So I checked it out and I'm glad I did. (I guess that's what we call a good marketing campaign.)<br /><br />I've long thought that there was much more to Perry than we were seeing. I just didn't think we'd ever see it. I remember seeing the SNL appearance and some of the interviews, and thinking that she was actually more intelligent than she let on. I'm pretty cynical about the biz right now and the conclusion I came to was that she was just pretending to be stupid because that's what sells, especially for women. &#34;How sad is that?&#34; I said, and I just shook my head and went right back to my collection, half of which is decades old.<br /><br />No, Prism is not perfect. It never completely leaves Perry's bubblegum pop identity behind, and she's just not a truly great singer. She's pretty good, but not a virtuoso like Fiona Apple or Adele, or a natural talent like Annie Reese. The album gets a little awkward in spots, though it's never &#34;bad&#34;.<br /><br />So why the 5 stars? What do I love so much about this album? In a word, growth. It's the sheer growth. It's seeing such a huge name step out of what's comfortable and safe, take a few risks and an even bigger step forward. I never thought she could come so far in just three years (maybe less). This album is more complex, more thoughtful, deeper, more challenging, more clever and intelligent that anything else she's done. Even the trademark double entendres are at least a little more subtle and witty.<br /><br />If you're not growing you're dying.<br /><br />Roar is probably the all around best, most solid song on the album, though others are also good and again, nothing is bad.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying she sucked before. Teenage Dream itself for example was a decent song for what it was. I just think the new stuff is more mature and generally better. To be fair, there is a place for basic no-frills pop, but it's possible to do that in a more intelligent way. Many artists have and now it looks like Katy Perry will too.
B008602KQI|4.0|Jennifer Lawrence and a great supporting cast - Stanley Tucci, Wes Bentley, Donald Sutherland, Woody Harrelson, and had to go back to the credits as I didn't recognize Elizabeth Banks and Lenny Kravitz (used to seeing him in dreadlocks).Jennifer's portrayal of Katniss is strong, kind, thoughtful, compassionate and in a blink of an eye won't hesitate to do what's necessary to defend herself.

B00CTSDDVO|5.0|If you don't think you'll enjoy a sci-fi action adventure movie, then just don't bother with this one. Let me put the emphasis on action for you. This movie has ACTION. Lots of action. In fact, the story is pretty much told through the action. I say that with a smile though.<br /><br />Also, the 3D is done well for the home experience - completely worth the extra penny.
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|I learned more about 1927 from this book than if I had been around during that time.  Very well written.
B00DYEN5QU|5.0|The 3D in this movie is spectacular and completely worth the extra money it takes to get it. Superman is at his best here. This is the Superman action that we've always dreamed about for a movie.
1419702238|5.0|The book was a Christmas gift for my 10 year old nephew.  He has a few other Jeff Kinney books, so he was very happy to add this one to his collection.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I work with kids like Victoria, kids with Reactive Attachment Disorder and histories of multiple foster homes and failed adoptions.  It sure seems this author has known these kids too.  She climbs inside this character as though she herself had been through her lonely, disconnected life.  This was the best book I've ever read on the inner life of a child/adult with Reactive Attachment Disorder.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Awesome product.  I have never and I will never pay for any sort of television service!  This allows me to tap into all the freeness of streaming content on the e-net but visible to a larger audience.  Use it every day.  Not perfect, haven't figured out how to get it to stream Amazon Prime content yet, but still definitely worth $35.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game keeps my mind working and is challenging to where it's not so easy that I beat the game in just a couple days
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game awesome powerups anyone could play u need to get th game it is amazing but I have to warn u INCREDIBLY ADICDIVE
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Really fun must play .... simple and easy. Play career or play multi player against locals. Create your own bot now
B00CH87HF4|5.0|love this game it is kind of like diablo or world of warcraft but with a mix of God of war overall I love an definatly recommend you get it
B0042RJWTC|3.0|Actually, I loved the series, however, was totally gob-smacked to find that I couldn't access closed captions - I am haring impaired.  Also one of the discs wouldn't play properly, so I didn't get a proper look at the end of series 2.  Bah humbug.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Fun movie.  My son was home sick  and this was the movie he wanted to see. My 7 year old loved it!  Fun movie to watch with the whole family
B005JTAP4S|5.0|I'm an adult and I enjoyed immensely O'Brien's work. I'm dying to read it to my daughter when she will be eleven. There is everything inside: feelings, magic, poetry, romance, adventure, psychology. I loved the beautiful descriptions: they really made me feel in that magical realm. I'm crazy for poems so I loved those at the end of the book. O'Brien can create true masterpieces and precious gems with his words. He made me dream, laugh and cry. I can't wait to read his next book.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|After seeing the movie, I finally read the book.  The concept was excellent.  However, I must say that it was anti-climatic, and a bit different than the movie. But, all in all, if I had to choose, I'd choose the movie over the book.
0385350864|3.0|Everyone knows the setup for this one, right? If not, read no further. We've jumped ahead something like 15 years after the marriage of Bridget Jones and Mark Darcy. They had two children, Billy and Mabel, and, five years before the book begins, Mark has been tragically killed on a do-good mission to Somalia.<br /><br />Doesn't that sound like it should be a complete bummer of a book? Well, it isn't. Fielding does a good job of portraying Bridget's pain, her rebuilding life and the evolution of her relationships with the characters we know from past books and movies. And there is some funny stuff and touching stuff here. For example, Bridget's observations on some of the aggressive yummy mummy types at her kids' schools, and the heart-to-heart between Bridget and her mother.<br /><br />But it's not funny that Bridget has herself changed so little. The complete lack of competence and self-discipline she had when young doesn't seem so amusing in a 50+ year old woman who is responsible for small children. The obsession with defining herself by relationships with men is just sad, when you consider all that she's gone through. I squirmed with embarrassment for her over her fling with toy boy Roxster. It didn't seem all that realistic, either, even for a relative bubblehead like Bridget. I don't know any 50-somethings with two small children who would be interested in a 30-year-old, even given the opportunity.<br /><br />I did read the whole book, though, and enjoyed parts quite a bit. In the end, I realized that what made the book work for me--to the limited extent it did--was thinking of it as more of a screenplay and picturing it as a movie in my mind. And I think a pretty decent movie could be made of the book.<br /><br />I'm glad I borrowed the book from the library rather than spent money on it, but I don't regret the time I spent reading it. In Amazon's rating system, three stars means \\"It's OK,\\" and that's just how I felt the positives and negatives of this one balanced out.lanced out.
0385523394|4.0|This book is just like the TV series. Reads the same, but with more detail. I would have rather read the book first, then watched the show. In any case a very interesting story.
B009NF54ZE|4.0|I like this game; no issues, hidden object and matching pairs challenging. Downside for me is no option to search hidden objects using words instead of silhouettes.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|Grisham can always entertain us with tips, clues and narratives about how the judicial system works.  Not an earth shattering book, though.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I've been playing this game for an hour or so and I just can't stop playing it I LOVE IT
B000FC1HBY|4.0|This was harder reading, I believe because it was more boring than the first, which I devoured. I hope the third is as good as the first and much, much better than this one.
0307895475|5.0|It's awesome I used it a lot since I'm obsessed to do EVERYTHING in games, I would so recommend this for anyone who wants to know everything about Skyrim, it's very informative. (I know it doesn't include Dragonborn but by the time I finished Skyrim, Hearthfire and Dawnguard I felt confident enough to explore Solstheim extensively with all the knowledge I've gotten from this book) Anyways this gets an 10/10 for me
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is enjoyable for the  whole  family. Flow Free is free! Plus, there are plenty of  levels with 5x5 and  higher puzzles such and9x9. Get this app!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love it very fun. Great for Kids and adults. It's a lot like temple run but way more enjoyable with way more things to do.
B007VUCAVO|4.0|Very handy and easy to use. I can monitor the usage of my kindle when using the different apps I have. I would recommend it
B004EI924E|5.0|This was one of the funniest movies we have seen in a while.  has CC and it is really a fun movie.  Good and silly movies are really hard to find.  Looking forward to RED 2.  A spoof on a James Bond film or others like it.  Perhaps the young people won't find it funny but the 50 and 60 group sure like it.
B009LDD22U|5.0|Another fantastic slab of the best comedy show on TV. Have hardly been able to watch it as my kids have the discs on repeat! Can't wait fie the next series to come out.
B00AEFXUL2|5.0|Love it.
B00EMGUR60|4.0|Age seems not to matter. Have always quite liked the band, but not been mad keen on their albums, but am really enjoying this one.
B00008CMR6|5.0|These movies always come quicker than they say they will.  All of the movies that I have watched so far have been great quality.
B005KMX866|3.0|Am big Chris Issak fan, and loved the idea of a covers set from him, however I think I prefer his original songs more, despite the great musicianship and singing on this double CD.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|I borrowed this from a friend this fall and this was seriously one of the best games I have played in years.  The story is great, the character interaction is the best I've seen and the turn based battle system works really well.  I have already started playing through for a second time.
B00E5N8E2O|5.0|Love this! It is pure nostalgia, but made me remember how good the original disc was and nice to see the band still performing and doing it so well. Have read some criticism that the show is all too staged and not 'pure' rock n roll, which seems a little ridiculous when Def Lep were never Motörhead or Dumpy' Rusty Nuts!
B003G4W49C|5.0|I've got this book, actually the whole series, in paperback.  This is an extraordinarily well written book and to those that criticize the concept that &#34;exceptional children don't think that way&#34; I say &#34;How do you know?&#34;.  My children, who aren't exceptional, well, at least at this level, know how to act and not act to make sure their parents don't &#34;get freaked out&#34; (sorry, the best phrase I can come up with).
B00DXP0QX0|3.0|Fascinating to hear these early versions of so many classic Rod Stewart songs, however this is a bit of disc for collectors - the solo albums have the best versions of the songs.
B00AZMFK3K|2.0|Dumbed-down version has tons of 'action' but takes a well-thought-out scenario & turns it into pablum.  The only reason that the Star Trek franchise lasted through 10 original movies (before 'reboot), five series, and multiple books, comic books, fanzines, merchandising, conventions, etc. is that the original vision had internal logic and fully-realized characters.  Abrams has reduced the intelligent (although limited by tv budgets & 60's conventions) story and turned it into something more akin to Land of the Giants, Lost in Space, Time Tunnel, and other cheesy 60's sci-fi.  Kirk is a maniacal loose cannon with a death wish who belongs more in Sons of Anarchy on a bike...not in charge of the newest starship in the fleet.  The retro-fascist &#34;surface&#34; uniforms don't help.  And the oft-criticized &#34;bridge officers to the surface&#34; scenario required by network & studio execs to get the show on the air are just emphasized to a higher degree here.  It appears that 5-6 people run the ship and the other 400-odd members are just mute technicians or toilet-scrubbers.  And the laughable insubordination and fraternizing that goes on...it makes the Enterprise seem more like a club than a group of officers.  Unforgivable is what Abrams did to Pike in rewriting one of the best chapters of the original series. On the other hand, there are tons and tons of special effects if that's your bag.
B00A3AUGEW|4.0|Great album! Like Phillips signature songwriting style. Up beat tempo of most of the songs make listening a pleasure. The sound bite offered will give you more than enough confidence to buy this work. It holds true through each song as well as the entire album. It's 'Feel Good' music.
B00GSAC1UI|5.0|I had never heard of Pentatonix until my cousins posted the You Tube video for Little Drummer boy on Facebook.  I was blown away.  My mom even asked me to purchase the album before I'd gotten around to it so I did.  Their voices are absolutely amazing and this may be my favorite Christmas album now.
B00902AKK4|5.0|So cute!  I haven't seen a game quite like this before.  Don't let the cuteness fool you.  This game can be very tricky!  Your bug travels about pushing the box he is in around the linear game track.  He must overcome obstacles and collect diamonds without crushing them.  Each area of the map has different challenges.  I enjoy it, and so do my kids ages 10,11, and 15.​
B00499NHLC|5.0|I was able to watch this for free on Amazon Instant Video as part of my Amazon Prime membership. It's an excellent modern update for the Holmes story and not as hyper-stylized as the recent movies (which is a good thing). Benedict Cumberbatch is a superb Holmes with his charmingly anti-social persona.
B00D6SBOWG|4.0|I really enjoyed this clever version of solitaire.  I was disappointed though to find it was not a full version, and to play beyond the first 6 games, you need to purchase the full version.  As a FAOTD, I would have thought it would have been the full version.​
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I think this game is good but you are going to have to read .but it is still a rilly good game
B00CGNYDIE|5.0|I love this game!  It is reminiscent of Mine Sweeper.  You use the color dot clues in each hex to determine the color of the hexagons around it. It is a very relaxing game.  You see a picture revealed with each tile you color correctly.  If you like logic games that aren't too difficult, this game is for you.​
B007FROH4G|5.0|We've chosen this book for our book club this month and I have found it a fantastic read. It is compelling, compassionate and insightful. It gives a fantastic narrative look into the difficult world of early onset dementia opening it up a little to create better empathy and understanding.
B00AYPXG5W|5.0|From the first page this book grabs you and if you are an end of the wold buff as I am or a zombie fan which I am NOT this book move along at a wonderful pace. New York a dead place for all except @@@@@ the lone survivor just an ordinary woman with no super powers except her own intelligence and determination and will to live. For me no religious overtones. A must read and I need to check to see in there is a sequel.
B000IZ7YK6|5.0|Legendary actors and actress in a fabled city entwined in a 'clash of cultures' combine to produce a monumental movie! Excellent viewing at many levels...
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I love this game! Challenging but fun and uniquely complex. Coming  up with different paths to try and develops your disease to pass it under the radar long enough in order to infect enough people and then figure out how to create the lethality to eradicate the species.. brilliant! I love the zombie expansion... can't rave about this game enough... great for science, biology and forensic anthropology geeks!
B00G32PQNA|1.0|All the fighting and it was so different than the others.  I just didn't like it at all.<br />too much dialogue.
B007IHH4I4|5.0|With a twist of punk...Lou tells it like it is....simply beautiful from start to finish...a must have in your vinyl collection
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This is one of my favorite games. The graphics are excellent and the weapons are various. Sometimes, when an animal falls, the dynamics are clumsy, but that does not take away from the overall quality. Nicely done and the seasonal features are a nice extra.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I thought it read delightfully suspensful.  I plan to read more about Pendergast in the up coming weeks.<br />Thank you..
B000VHMF0A|5.0|It's Bob come on now Legendary album u can jam it all album non stop that's what's up right the
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Greed, bigotry, and history intersect in this engaging tale  of redemption and forgiveness.  No one writes with such clarity about the South's demons as John Grisham.
B007HU4FZ2|2.0|Full of blood and gore but lacking any real sense of majesty, glory or spirituality.  Obviously the intention was to show the reality of what Christ endured, giving us a better appreciation of his sacrifice.  For devout Christians, I can understand how they might bring their own sense of faith and &#34;passion&#34; to the intensity of what's being shown.  But as a film, and as a historical account, it expressed a lot of pain and agony but not a great deal of depth.  I don't believe for one second Mel Gibson was inspired by God to make this, and that kind of talk is just crazy fanaticism.  Visually, the movie looked very closed in and confined, when there should've been a feeling of expansiveness.  &#34;Braveheart&#34; was more inspiring and epic than this, which shouldn't be the case.  In fact, I was more moved by Jesus Christ Superstar than &#34;The Passion.&#34;
B005PK56TA|5.0|Great storytelling.  Love the blend of old time America with modern day.  Super creepy though!  Hard to watch before bedtime.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|its really really really really good! but there should be more things available to create that's why its 4 stars 5 if improves!!!!!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This is a good game for all ages and the updates on this app are the best. I like the special plunge that you will need to buy but it is worth it.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|it is the best game in the world!  love the m1a1 thompson! and the sten mark 2 such cool guns
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|It's free what could be better. Great graphics. Hasn't frozen. Altogether it is simple and fun. I would defiantly recommend this game to all my friends.
B0074QGGK6|4.0|There are old ideas here, such as steal your ideas from people you admire, and always keep working.<br /><br />New ideas here for me was that it is okay to have a day job.  When you start getting paid for art then others can control your art.<br /><br />I loved the idea of keeping a folder for positive emails when you need a pick me up.  Will start that now.<br /><br />So for creative people this a very good book giving practical advice on being creative in the 21st century.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love this game it is awesome and super fun it is not hard to play and I love candy you should play it all the time.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|The author does a superb job in creating a vivid picture of what life was like in the late 1700's.  You become so emotionally connected to these characters that you laugh and grieve along with them.  I was sad when the book ended... I wanted it to keep going!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Mindnumblngly effortless and fun, gave me some trouble to update to the Christmas version though, did not automatically update. But nice
0062290797|5.0|Purchased as a gift so I haven't read it yet myself. Excellent merchant, received quite quickly. Sounds like a true American hero.
B00ECL7ZJ2|5.0|The are the best band except for The Beatles. Really I/m not kidding and I remember the Beatles, I'm 54 years old so there.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|FABULOUS!  This movie made me wish super-heros were real!  Fantastic cast, Black Widow kicks *ss!  RDJ is awesome as always, but the surprise is Tom Hiddleston... You just love to hate Mr Hiddlestons Loki... Soooo bad-*ss!!
B0048KXRPS|5.0|Emma Thompson is a dream of an actress. This pleasant comedy brought smiles to one and all, and showed how this magical nanny transformed a family.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I loved the first two books, but this one seemed rushed and poorly written. It's slow and disappointing. I hate to see a good series end this way!
B00GH4RKYM|4.0|Thought this was a good movie, worth the rent. Little different spin on the story. Great cast, love the soundtrack.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Grisham does justice to the topic of racial strife in Mississippi while weaving a compelling tale and spoiling readers with engaging courtroom dialog, tricks, and details. Rich characterizations and intermittent action, intricate descriptions of the culture and people combine to make the narrative believable and endearing. Any reader can overcome the story's only potential drawback of predictability in the outcome by applying confident optimism about America's ability to systemically and individually right old wrongs and to tirelessly maintain the expectation of &#34;justice for all.&#34;
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is great! Its like temple run but much more exciting! its a great game for all ages! Have fun!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I wish there was a way to get past next level without waiting for friends or having to use coins. Skill should be a factor also
075666733X|5.0|This is an unbelievably complete book and is indispensable in locating all the body parts and definitions. I enjoyed finding out more about the human body from skeleton to skin.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I cried at, I laughed at, and agonized this book. It is a great adventure. Long live the remembrance of Marius, Cosette, Jean, Valjean, Epponine, and MASTER OF THE HOUSE!<br />It's also a great movie.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|it is the most coolest game ever you so need to get its just like timpul run but with minions tuning for ever well until you die.
B00GTZN0X4|1.0|The rating is issued based upon playback or more accurately the lack of. For what ever reason this would not stream to any other device besides the PC without issue. When I used my Roku, there was a distinct click at the start of the film and after that no audio. On the PS3 it would buffer every few minutes. This was the same on the two separate occasions that I attempted to watch this with my children.<br /><br />when other movies played on these devices the same there was no issue. I did do a power cycle of my players and the modem as outlined in the help section. This had no impact. The fact that other films played fine and power cycling of my network and players had no effect, points to an issue within the amazon video service. I hope that this isse is resolved before I attempt to watch another film.<br /><br />From what I saw of it, the movie was pretty good I thought.
B00G722T22|5.0|I haven't listened to Avril Lavigne in years, and decided to try out her new album. I must say I was impressed. The music is such fun, and boy that girl has a wonderful voice!
B00AEFZ8OY|5.0|Team America is one of the few movies that can lampoon everybody equally, regardless of race, creed, nationality, or religion.  No matter who you are, or where you stand on anything, something in this movie will offend you.  That's the beauty of Team America.  Most political satire takes a side, and it's only funny to the producer's fellow cool-aid drinkers.  Team America caricatures and lampoons EVERYBODY.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|I try to make it to level 15 but before I could the app shut of and won't come back on. I tried to get back but it won't t let me. I hate it!
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|Through the thirteen novels that make up the Pendergast series of books Preston & Child have created a very entertaining universe of characters that make their way in and out of Agent Aloysius X. Pendergast’s various investigations.  In many ways it’s through the eyes of all the other characters that we get the true idea of how fantastically skilled and completely strange Pendergast is.  Now don’t get me wrong all the extra characters outside Pendergast are main characters themselves in the various novels, but they all point towards Pendergast as being one of the most interesting and dynamic characters in all of literature.  One of my favorite books in the series was Still Life With Crows, which is where we were first introduced to the wild child Corrie Swanson.  In Still Life with Crows Corrie was your typical disaffected teenager, but through the following novels, and under the tutelage of Agent Pendergast, Corrie has grown into determined young woman who is the main focus of this book.  Corrie needs to find a topic to do a dissertation on so she can continue her studies to become a police investigator, so she decides to do it on a forensic analysis of some ancient crimes in Colorado.  Her investigation opens up a can of worms that Agent Pendergast has to come in to help with.  I greatly enjoyed this book as I have all the other books in this series.  The fact that they threw in investigative lines that included Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Oscar Wild was a great add on to a very interesting story.  I would consider this a stand alone because it leaves the intense story lines that were going on in Fever Dream, Cold Vengeance, and Two Graves and instead concentrates on this one investigation.  There are references back out to the main story liners of those other three novels which just serves to get you hooked into whatever the next book is going to bring, but this book stands on it’s own and is a great addition to the series as a whole.  This continues to beone of my all time favorite series of books and I would highly recommend it to anyone who hasn’t started reading it.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Well written and gripping towards the end. If you liked John Grisham's other books, you will love this one. Good pager turner and pretty quick read.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|This is an excellent documentary. The life of Robert McNamara is very interesting. Some of his choices in life changed history in the 20th century, from his advice in WWII to his fact finding missions in Vietnam and beyond. One of my favorites!
B00CIR97UW|5.0|A thoroughly pleasant read with just the right amount of higher mathematics so as to appeal to a wide audience.
B008J5T4Q4|5.0|P!nks The Truth About Love is a Intelligent and Fun Journey just like 2009's Funhouse. The Songs are well Orchestrated. And the Tour was Brilliant, P!nk Swears if you don't like it Don't buy it, its just P!nk being herself, she cussed in the past, if you liked her then, You have no reason to Complain about it now. This album is amazing on Vinyl, CD, and fan edition CD ..her new DVD live in Melbourne I available for pre-order now! Go on indulge yourself a little..its the Holidays!
B008JFUO4U|4.0|short movie inspired from various Sci-Fi movies like the Matrix.<br />Very well crafted extraordinary space crafts, pods, weapons, transportation machines, lots of good designs and care has been put in to this by good designers.<br /><br />Good acting and enjoyable<br />but as a I said, too short of an idea, slightly 'Too Stretched Out'
B00ERIUO02|1.0|I was Hoping that Katy would make that Dark album she promised. But She released Roar and all my hopes were Shot.<br />Then the rest of the CD isn't as bad but doesn't impress like teenage dream. Don't let my review persuade you I'm just<br />Into darker music.
B00ADQPA38|5.0|we thoroughly enjoyed AHS season 1<br />This is more gory and enticing at the same time.<br />crazy but highly recommend it
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|Lady Gaga did not dissapoint on ARTPOP , I think a lot of Haters and other fan bases gave a lot of bad reviews! Arpop is a journey<br /> If you do not understand ART, don't bother. This is a thinking mans album if you want another Bad Romance, or Poker Face you're in the wrong place. ARTPOP  takes you to new Dimensions a whole other path not traveled. I have to say that Gaga grows with each Album. If you don't have a open mind the journey will lose you. A+++ CD!
B001U3Y5XE|5.0|We love this game. My boys ages 5 and 7 can play it for hours. I also enjoy it, family fun
B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|Not even possible or plausible.  Characters straight out of someone's crazy imagination...waste of good download and reading time.  Don't bother
B004AM5QT4|4.0|Good story. Fast pace . Would recommend it to anyone with some medical background. Thrilling and very enjoyable. Another of Ken Follett intriguing stories.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved this book!  Wrapped everything up in the series. So moving. Even through its darkness, it brings hope at the end. Very much makes you think of the deeper meanings in the book. Adults will read the book differently than children will. I recommend it for all ages.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Amazing and super addicting. Quality entertainment- most controversial season of all. A definite must-see, just be sure you've got some free time to finish the whole season, because you won't be able to stop.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm so glad they FINALLY have this for kindle. Its a great app, no hangups, no issues. Have fun playing this one!
B002UZ5CHO|4.0|Very informative and eye-opening. And as it says, &#34;you won't look at food the same way again&#34;. Makes you think twice about where and how your food magically appears in the supermarket or restaurants.
B000FC130E|5.0|This was a very imaginative and well written story.  The characters were interesting and well developed and the ending just begs for a sequel.  An enjoyable read.
0394826817|1.0|Too long for a three year old and parent. Lots of words and multiple pictures on one page. Too much for young minds learning to focus.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I love Feedly. It's the first thing I open on my Kindle to catch all the current headlines and decide which ones I want to go deeper into!
B007IXWL2C|3.0|The first book was definitely was awesome, but the next two books were repetitious and boring.  Editing it down to one book would have been good.
B00AA03D18|4.0|The fact that someone so into science and with no faith wrote this, made it much more compelling. Very intriguing and comforting when I think about dying.
B00DRPVE3M|2.0|NOW I can't connect through Facebook or as a guest. It'll say &quot;connecting&quot; then the app will crash. Please fix this problem.
B009G41CG2|5.0|Probably my favorite game of all time. The default configuration is the one I learned on and it's still my personal favorite.
030758836X|5.0|Good read... book in good condition... wish I could have bought a paperback but this works.  Received as expected on time.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Very fun game :) try it  I recommend this game but it's your opinion just write your comment below so if There's any problems with this game I could change it :)
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Ms.. Roth had me right up till the end- then I was...Screaming, crying and just incredibly SAD!  Then I went back and read the last few pages.  I think I now understand the message, but still not the WAY she went about it.<br />Still SAD in Minnesota!
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|I think the game is very enjoyable and my kids can play it as well. Looking forward to getting more robots purchased
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|An enjoyable quick read blending fact & fiction to inspire further reading in noetics, Free Masons and US History. It's what he does best. If you want a quick, light engrossing read then look no further. Perfect for a plane ride or vacation.
B006MW3UZW|1.0|I just love Masterpiece Theatre, the acting and the sets are fabulous, finally there is something worth watching on television.
B00AESN8XY|3.0|I love the concept bought a zombie pack but it's slow to get the DNA points Would love to see the &quot;Zombies&quot; as actual walking Seperate creatures Make some improvements with pace and graphic s and I'll keep playing
B008MVPF6I|3.0|I bought two pairs, one in another color and slightly different. The colors are bright and the shoe is fairly comfortable
B00GM9G476|1.0|This movie looks fantastic, but that's about it. The fight scenes are ridiculously hard to follow, the story is bland, the acting isn't that good, huge letdown. Do not bother.
B00G70J81O|4.0|This is the best Wolverine movie so far.  The movie did a great job paying homage to the Wolverine comic series.. In true Marvel fashion, remember to wait for and watch the tie-in to the next movie.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|i have been waiting for this game for the kindle for the longest time. I have to agree that it is very addictive and you wait to complete the level to go to the next one.
B00CCXL9OE|2.0|This is NOT a U.S. Blue ray!  The Disney rewards code inside does not work here in the U.S. only the UK.  This movie better work in my blue ray player or it's going back!
B0091REZMW|3.0|Fun game when it works. I have trouble getting it to load it will start to load then all of a sudden cut out. It's fun when I can get on it. I am not sure if I will keep it if it just keeps glitching no matter how fun it is I am not sure if the glitching I'm experiencing is worth it. If it doesn't glitch for you then I hope you enjoy this game as it is fun
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|When I first heard of this movie, I thought Denzel was going to provide some action in a flight movie. Worth watching. I was blown away at the message in this movie. It's hard playing an addict for any actor. The reason is, they have to really understand the underlying issues in order to pull it off on screen. Denzel does this and more. The writers really had a direction with this movie and I really love how they put it together in the end.<br /><br />This movie does have a great action seen with a large passenger jet flying inverted to a crash landing, but the movie is much more than that. It's about an addict who finally realizes that his actions (while using) do not only effect himself, but everyone around him he is responsible for.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|As you read it you think about the events of a war and how they touch lives.  I read this book with such earnest and couldn't finish it fast enough as I wanted to know what happened next with each character.  The author has the ability to take a tragic situation make you feel like you are right in the midst of all the chaos and beauty of humanity.  This is an excellent story that I highly recommend others to read.  It will stay with you for a long time.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Excellent sequel to The Shining. Maybe we will see another one in the future where they grow older and<br />encounter more people with the gift.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|Great book.  You will learn much about Pakistan and the Taliban.  And appreciate the educational opportunities we have when many have none.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Loved A T one to Kill.  This was a good book to follow up with Jake Brigance.  It is a must read.
B00G4I11YQ|5.0|Wow! A truly eye popping documentary and not in the vein of Free Willy, even though you reach that conclusion by the end of the story. Orcas are smart, not unlike the veloceraptors as pack hunters. True, there are many stories of an Orca saving the lives of Eskimos and people abandoned at sea-but, there's a huge difference in temperament of an Orca roaming free in the ocean than one you confine for 20 years in swimming pool-especially an alpha male. Sea Worlds everywhere should be shut down. If you want to see an Orca or dolphins rent a boat a sail along side them, but let's keeep them out of the confines of a bathtub.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I am enjoying this app. I played the original on Facebook. With this one you don't have to ask people to send you stuff. Only thing is, the things you have to purchase at the beginning is a tad bit spendy.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Started late this one after having watched the movie, nevertheless it was a great read despite knowing the story line
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|fun to playhouse!  very addicting!  play it every. chance I get.  I recommended it to all my friends and family!
B003O86FMW|5.0|brilliant - fast paced. The second edition lives to the pace set by the first. The end made me jump to the third right away :)
B0027MJU00|5.0|Very exciting...definitely one of those &#34;page-turners&#34;.  The plot was great and the twists were exciting .Great read..difficult to give my eyes a rest.
B000RLFJQ2|5.0|As action movies go, this is absolutely one of the greatest. Robert DeNiro was perfectly cast for this movie. As DeNiro movie HEAT was known for the greatest street shootout, Ronin is known for the greatest car chases. There is endless suspense and action, with a complex, international plot. So... WHAT was in that case that the Irish wanted it so badly? Was it a portable nuke? Or maybe the secret formula for Guiness Stout? Who knows.... But this movie is one of the greats, in terms of guy movies. If you have the means, watch this in a home theater at maximum volume, as a double feature with HEAT. I get goose bumps just thinking about that. NOT A CHICK MOVIE.
0140042520|5.0|The book was in fine shape...just worn enough to give it character.  Of course the book itself is one of my favorites....bought it for my son...it's time he enjoyed it as well
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|The story of two Afghanistan women who depict how war makes them resilient.  How true friendship are bounded in the most painful moments.  A must read to better understand the consequences of oppression and war.
157421327X|3.0|Not what I expected....but I gave as a gift.  For the size if had good information.  It was not what I expected
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is the best book I have ever read. I don't read much, but I just couldn't put this book down, and that should say something! Love love loved it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a coin addicting game that I like to play all the time and I think that you should get it because it's really really fun and energetic.
1451666179|5.0|I've been a fan of Allie's blog for years, and was delighted to see new content along with the old favorites in her first book.  Her writing style is exemplary and her artwork fantastic, and, as expected, she had me both laughing and crying.  It's a beautifully-made book, too;  the pages are thick and glossy.<br />Allie is brave to share her sometimes challenging life story and I admire her courage and her ability to laugh at herself and her life; her gift to me, a stranger, is that she helps me do the same with mine.
B005I4JG80|5.0|As a first time mother my iPad is full with baby books: what to expect and happy child and sleep gurus and mayo clinic<br />I was a bit surprised with his one but it does make a lot of sense once you start thinking about it.<br />Loved some ideas, puzzled with few, not sure id be able to enforce couple but bottom line great book and super useful
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|I hate having to wait for people to invite you in .to get further in the game.it completely spoils the fun.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I like the app and  the convenience of buying online.  I also like that I could easily download my books to a new device and that they all sync up so I'm always on the right page when i start reading.
B00ET0PZDO|5.0|Bought this app with some coins I had earned, definitely would have bought it. I recommend this to anyone who wants to challenge their minds
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Amazing iinsight  for anyone who thinks they want to start or run a business.  It teaches the right questionable to ask.  A lesson for all.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I was hesitant at first because so many of these are so simplistic, yet this one makes you think and remember little details.
B00DWZHTRW|5.0|Unpredictable movie, great plot, surprises galore. How they did what they did, always explained before the movie ended with a bang.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is so awesome. Its so addictive but in a good way. I think everyone should get this game. It is so fun to play and you get to upgrade ur shark. You start off with a shark with a baby shark and then u upgrade every time. Little spoiler alert the mystery shark after the Great White Shark can eat ANYTHING. Hes the biggest baddest shark. THIS MAY BE LONG BUT IM TELLING U THIS GAME IS AWESOME.
B008JFURII|5.0|Great cast doing impossible, unpredictable things. Fun to watch and guess who's bad and who's good. It all comes together.
B001NLL93W|4.0|Just when  I thought it couldn't get any better. It did. This book is filled with plot twists. Just when you think you know what's going on Cassandra Clare throws a whole new scenario at you. I'm gonna be so sad when I finish the series. Defiantly recommend the whole series!
B00BN3DPQ4|3.0|Schwarznegger showing his age. He obviously didn't hire &#34;Body by Jake&#34; to get his old muscles looking fit again, as he kept his jacket and shirt on looking old. Just okay acting, with a typical &#34;High Noon&#34; plot.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love the movies and also love this game is so addictive and I play it when ever I can.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|An entertaining sci-fi movies. Great CG in 3D, with blasting, crisp 7.2 sound. A continuation of the JJ Abrams, Star Trek, including a visit by Leonard Nimoy‎. Nice story line, even for non fans of the on-going series.<br /><br />Finally, they start their five-year mission, and end with the original theme music from the TV series.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is an amazing last book. It's a must read before the Mockingjay movie comes out. It's a very sweet ending anyone would love.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|It made me want to scratch my Jimmy off and finger my brown eye. Doo Dah, Doo Dah, you stinking fongies
B00004ZELJ|5.0|I loved getting to see an up close and personal view of this concert. It's entertaining and we'll worth the money!
B009AMANBA|5.0|This is simply one of the greatest movies ever made!  I saw it 3 times at the theater when it was released.  It was a must for my movie collection.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Best game ever. I just can't stop playing. Only request is the new update. For some reason my kindle isn't showing the ability to update.
B004INNRFK|4.0|Not as good as his first hit man cd, but worth every bit of it for Chaka Khan and Donna Summers - Awesome ladies!!!
B009EE1GC4|5.0|Very clever and heartwarming movie with a lot of positive and true messages about aging and relationships. Kind of movie we watch over and over.
B00000D9TQ|4.0|Collins or Genesis fans this is a must have.  on MP3 it goes anywhere and relive fond memories of those past times
B00GINENG0|1.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this app for what it was even though it does get boring fast because there is not alot to do unless you want to play the same mini game over and over, or spend real money. But then, after a full day of playing it and it working perfectly fine, a glitch happened and the app would not open anymore. I would click to open the app, and the screen went completely black. I could hear my Tom's noises, but the screen was black. I restarted the app several times and got the same result so I uninstalled it. Was going to reinstall it to see if it fixed it but I decided it was getting boring anyway so don't even bother. Not sure if it was actually a problem with the app or my kindle, but considering my kindle has never behaved that way with any other application, I'm going to say this problem is on you guys. Would I recommend this app? Yeah, to kids maybe. And that's only if it doesn't give them the same problem it gave me.
B00001ZULV|4.0|great group of thier best music. If you like Genesis this is a must have. put them on MP3 take them anywhere
B008QE9XD2|4.0|For a description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  Just a quick mini review of this Tim Burton movie...<br /><br />Dark Shadows (2012) is a movie version of the old TV series from the late '60s and early '70s.  However, this movie is more of a blend of horror and camp, way more so than the TV series was.  The things I liked about the movie were the dark atmospheres, the special effects (though much of the time they looked so artificial), Johnny Depp's acting, and the camp element.  This is basically a lighthearted horror movie with some dark atmospheres.  This movie doesn't take itself too seriously, and you as the viewer shouldn't, either.  If you keep this in mind while watching it, I think you'll have a fun time.<br /><br />Recommended.
0399255370|5.0|A very clever, cute book. The crayons are a little snarky, but in a kid-centric way that real kids will relate to and therefore appreciate. Everyone gets cranky when they feel they're being treated unfairly. Aside from simply enjoying this book, we've used it as a lesson in how to problem-solve and learn to get along. For instance, what could each crayon have done before things reached such a crisis point? Maybe they could have let the child know their feelings before things got so bad they had to run away. Our kids chose a favorite crayon and wrote their own letters along these lines.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Very well crafted novel. I enjoyed it very much.  Read it mostly on the plane from China so had about 10 hours!
B002RKRGQ2|5.0|You just gotta love Jeeves.  Wodehouse certainly knows his redoubtable character.  Always entertaining and always great fun with a stiff upper lip!
B007EECSFA|5.0|This was a superb novel. Kate Morton delivered again. Always enjoy her books and am looking forward to the next one.
B000FC12YQ|5.0|A good read.  You can't go wrong with Agatha Christie's Poirot and this book is no exception to the rule.
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|I'm only halfway through and I can tell you this is must read material. It puts you back in a much different place and time, separated from us by a mere 85-90 years. It was a time that I think we believed in ourselves more than we do now, in this 21st century. It fills you with fascinating details of the main characters as well as the supporting cast of the age. There's hardly a page that turns without saying to yourself, &#34;That's amazing, I never knew that&#34;. Get this book.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Excellent book - not seat of the edge exciting, but good steady character and plot development.  Very enjoyable! Ready for the next Grisham tale - I've read them all!
B00DQQSD2W|5.0|The book costs $12 and look amazing in kindle. The enhanced material is a nice bonus. I recommend it to every star wars fan!
B00AGDVWDK|5.0|This is a wonderful and moving story that makes Christmas time complete.  It was excellent in streaming from Amazon's site and we have purchased it for future years to come.
B00BPA2PFM|3.0|Pretty decent movie but watch out for the audio drop outs.  If this happens switch to bitstream.  My Oppo had no problem decodiing it.  Poorly mastered which is why the 3 stars.
B00FAI2IUM|5.0|I would suggest downloading this game if u are a fan of racing.<br />It has very good graphics.<br />I LOVE IT!!!!!
B009C7ZQM4|1.0|This app has pornography video solicitations in it. I have removed it after 500 days of use. It was working great until they let the porn fairies in. Definitely not for kids. Definitely not for me. I hate pornography. I am offended by this product. It is not appropriate to have this kind of app embedded with pornography links.
B0090P98Z4|3.0|Game seems to be redundant. Nice graphics though, and loading time is acceptable. I'll play it some more to see where it takes me
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This is the best strategy game for the Kindle. It's like real life. So fun!!!!!!!!!!! I recommend for all ages. Very enjoyable!
B005T87QCI|1.0|It is a terrible game. it just crashs ur divice!!! If u want a awesome real steel get the free version. Its free and not a stupid game like this
B007D5E7C2|5.0|This is great movie with the mastery in sword fighting and a few twist.  One who seeks revenge after an attempt was made on her life.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is so fun, but there's a little bit of glitches and bugs to work out but other than that the game is awesome
B003O86FMW|5.0|I'm so in love with this book, I really like it :) I'm rooting for  peeta so bad!!! But I love gale too
B005LAIIGW|5.0|An avid Sci-Fi reader and Film snob I went into this one skeptical.  I left very happy to have seen it while still on the big screen.  Sandra and George do an excellent job and the cinematography was just awesome.  Like many good movies I discovered things after the movie which made me go WOW I didn't realize that during the film.  Its a great movie!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Very good story and fascinating perspective from which it is told.  Made me really appreciate the good fortune I have and gave me a new sense of appreciation for how difficult life can be for some, especially those who have to endure the hardships of war and persecution.
B00AEFY5TI|5.0|Loved seeing this film again with my daughter and granddaughter (age 12) - in part to prep for a 50's dance at school.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|its a very fun game.but its basiclay a copy of subway suffers! but I like this game better it is slow sometimes.
B00AAQHP66|5.0|Really good surfing film with family backstory. Filming took place along the coast just south of San Francisco - Half Moon Bay - which is why I bought the film.
B00AB7HESI|1.0|I think that it is the worst game. It makes me start over all the time!!!<br />It is also very boring.
B00GH4R95C|1.0|What a dull, overlong mess; how anyone could use this much money and this many great actors to produce such a snooze-fest is beyond me.  I couldn't believe how long this drug on.
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|The game is fun but the further you advance you have to pay for extra &quot;energy&quot;.  It really isn't free.
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|Love this show, so far every season is better than the one before.  A little racy at times, but genuinely creepy and fun to watch.
159463176X|3.0|I have to begin saying I have read all of Hosseini's books. Maybe if this was the first book I read my opinion would be different. I started living this book for the first quarter: the story is very interesting, and as usual, the author has a way of telling it that catches the reader from the first sentence. But after the first chapters, around half-way through the book,the story begins to dilute, as other characters and stories come into action, and the main story gets lost in the back.<br />It was a bit hard to keep track of all the characters and stories taking place at the same time. I would have preferred to keep it simple and focus on the main characters, their story is very rich, and could have been enough. It is still a very good story, a emotive view of the country from the distance, a nice way to tell people how it feels to be seen as a foreigner in your own country. As I said at the beginning, if this was the first book from the author I read, I think I would give it 4 stars, but knowing his style and previous books, I was expecting more.
1557048630|4.0|enjoyed the background and illustrations on how the characters developed and how that influenced their appearance and animation.  Conversationally written.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Not a morbid look at the future like I thought it would be. Kept my interest all the way through.
B00C7TAF3Y|2.0|Not my idea of entertainment.  I bought it based on the comments.  Big mistake.  If you like this more power to you.  I don't.  I like chalenging games, but this isn't it!
B0047DVHV2|5.0|Great insight into what really happened during our youth. Instead of what the establishment wants us to remember.<br />Keith is very honest, much better than magazine or press headlines.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Makes you want to run, for fun and for life. An easy and captivating read, its hard to put down once you get started. Highly recommended
B00GP0G0IK|2.0|Thought this would be longer for the price. Mini games are most of this game and take the most time
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Great Bond film. Daniel Craig as J. Bond is the best one in awhile. Solid film, great camera work. Watch it
B000YMHOUS|5.0|One of the rare kind movies I have seen which has so much deeper perspective on olden times lifestyle as well as race discrimination issues!
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|I played this for 8 hours strate. You will have so much fun playing this game.it is my favorite game.
0670024856|5.0|I am embarrassed to admit that I almost missed out on this transcendent reading experience.  First of all, I was less than thrilled when I read that it was about a botanist in the 18th century.  Second,I am a cynic and took my disappoinment and turned it into the belief that Gilbert was surely only cashing in on her Eat, Pray, Love success. I assumed she  was trying to tap the golden goose of her bestseller for more money with this effort.  We all know what assuming really does,  and I now can't stop recommending this book.  It is fascinating, absorbing, delightful and so well-researched.  It is a very intelligent book.  It is also a spiritual book and a love story.  All I can say is that Gilbert is one talented writer, and the success of Eat,  Pray, Love was not some kind of fluke. Now I want to read more of her. I am getting Committed: A Love Story. In the future I won't let the fact that a writer is a bestselling author keep me from an honest investigation of the second book.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game except for 1 thing... it won't connect to my Facebook account... tried many times, even reloaded the app... nothing. Love the game though.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I like the game ok, but out freezes all the time.  The higher you go the more it freezes or just goes slow.  It doesn't matter which device I use it does it on all of them.  I've had to reinstall  and start over a few times.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|She is eight years old and loves this game like crazy. If they like the show they would play this game
0425266060|5.0|Just wonderful books!!!!  I am engrossed in the love story of Giddeon and Eva.  I think these are very much comparable to Fifty Shades Trilogies for sure.  Could not put them down either.  LOVE the books!!!
B000003FPN|5.0|All of the pieces on this CD are wonderful to listen to and enjoy. However, my favorite in the Polka and Fugue from the Opera Schwanda by Weinberger. It is such a joy flu sound that lifts the soul and carries it forward. Classical music is not the choice of everyone, yet if one can settle down and just let your inner being be in tune with the music it has a whole range of moods that You may well feel united to. The symphony From a New World has music that is sure to delight people of all ages. This CD has several bonus pieces to enjoy.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|It was beautiful and sad wonderful. The writing was exceptional. I liked the fact it included what it was like for the German people who protected the Jewish people. I couldn''t put it down.Can't wait to read other books by this author. Looking forward to the Movie.
B00B935SUY|5.0|Great insight into the recording process, mixing both old and new technologies, genres, musicians, and songs.  Really enjoyable, all about the music!!
B000O8OTNC|3.0|I gave this a 3 star because although it does exactly what it is designed to do and it is lightweight and easy to use, it does seem as though with use the file has began to come loose. I do like it and it is convenient, for the price it is worth having for a quick edge but I would not make this my only source to sharpen my edged tools and weapons.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Ok,  Game of Throwns,  need I say more.  The interwining stories are wonderful and it is a series to get lost in.  I actually am enjoying this from a business perspective,  how to screw your way to the top and then get killed by your competition.
B007EDYN36|5.0|This was a great book! Mr. Criss is very truthful. Everyone must read this book!!!!! I want to read it again!! Please get it!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|LOVE the John Corey books - such a wise guy but a fully drawn character.  Love how his views (DeMille's?) come out and there are enough twists to keep everyone happy.  also left room for another book...
B004G6009U|4.0|box came a little dinged but I think that's manufacturer's issues. If you haven't seen Tangled it is truly an enjoyable movie.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Card at his best. I've read the series several times and the new books take the story even further. If you like the original Dune series you will love this.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|It's easy to use and setup and the picture quality is great. I just wish they had more channels to watch.... supposedly they will add more... but it's been out awhile with no other updates.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|It's a fun game to play. I really enjoy it. I don't have to play it every day to keep up with it, so that is a huge plus for me.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|Twenty-Eight and a Half Wishes is about a young women, Rose, who carries an innocent heart of gold. Rose was raised suppressed and harshly by her mother. This part, of how Rose was raised, reminds me of the movie Carrie. Twenty-Eight and a Half Wishes is less dramatic, but the mother/ daughter relationship did play on the edge, and had me recalling the movie.<br /><br />Twenty-Eight and a Half Wishes is filled with mystery and romance. Who killed Rose’s wicked mother? Why is the drop-dead, gorgeous, neighbor, Joe helping Rose? He never gave her the time of day before. Will Rose ever get wish 15, or will she die first?<br /><br />Author Denise Grover Swank, kept me guessing all the way through. Then, she surprised me at the end with a laugh!<br /><br /> I highly recommend Twenty-Eight and a Half Wishes.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|Good game! Would like to get more storage easier.  Hard to feed troll with limited storage. But otherwise an okay game.
0142410705|4.0|I love John Green and this was the only one of his novels I hadn't read. He thoroughly deserves his success. His writing is elegant and beautiful, but still easy to read.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Basic match game but some cool effects.  Fun to play! If you are looking for a starter game of this type, this is a good one to get.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham at his best!  Have always enjoyed his novels and this one was no exception.  Enjoyed the setting again in Ford County with the familiar characters.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Can't wait to read the 3rd.  1st read this then saw the movie.  Loved both :)<br />Collins does it again.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|The Lone Survivor gives life like account on what it is like to be part of the teams. I don't know how Marcus could have explained it any better. Great job Marcus my Heart goes out to you Mikey, Axe and Danny.
B00G4CXHSK|1.0|The game starts you at the beginning if you die! I can't stand this game, it sucks. If I were you I wouldn't waste the space and time by downloading this s***ty game
B00GIY5OGC|5.0|Great movie. good movie for the little ones.we enjoyed this move, nothing like vegin out on the couch will the little ones are sick and watching a good move
B00D2PIUAM|2.0|Phoned in this album with only 10 songs and only two of them listenable. They are starting to sound like a cover band of themselves, sad to see. B3EP was a better album for the buck by far.
B006UKFFE0|5.0|If you want to avoid the pain of building stuff that no-one wants to use, &#34;Running Lean&#34; is a useful, practical &#34;how-to&#34; book to support Eric Ries's &#34;Lean Startup&#34; which was more about high level ideology.<br /><br />It was _the_ book for me to actually start applying the Lean Startup principles in work life instead of just discussing the principles.
0345528581|5.0|This is a great book for staying in shape while traveling. There are some silly exercises, but for the most part the exercises are good. I don't recommend the upside down headstand push ups however.
B00E9ZATTY|5.0|Actually it was a treat for my husband and son, who loved the movie in the theater.  It was just as good on the small screen, and we can enjoy it any time we want.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I found it very well written and the book kept my interest.  I found the ending to be very satisfying and I enjoyed the series a great deal.

B0089LOKHG|5.0|In the third and final book, Lena and Hana alternate narration and continue to learn and grow throughout the book. There is a lot of fighting-both outward struggle and inner turmoil, but in the end, the reader is left with a sense of hope.<br /><br />Hana has been &#34;cured&#34; and is preparing for her marriage to the mayor, Fred. [ We learn that she is the one who ratted out Alex and Lena, which is no surprise. It was right after Hana found out about their relationship that Alex and Lena were captured in Delirium. [.<br /><br />Fred is a cruel, violent man with many secrets. He wants Hana to be a good, obedient wife and not ask any questions. This is difficult for Hana because we learn the cure did not work so well on her. In fact, in book 3, we learn that so many people have not been wholly cured and the reader wonders if the cure works completely on anyone.<br /><br />Hana is remorseful for what she's done to Lena and her family and tries to make penance as best she can. [ In a final show of loyalty, she allows her friend to escape. And we know that Hana and Lena will be all right.<br /><br />Lena is struggling with the fact that Alex hates her and that she doesn't want to hurt Julian. The group suffers many hardships and losses in an effort to survive. In the past, the authorities have left the Wilds alone. But now, the regulators are attacking the Invalids. Things between Lena and Alex grow more tense until Alex leaves the group and goes off on his own. Later, Lena learns from another girl that Alex never stopped loving her.<br /><br />Lena learns to make peace with her mother. Finally she understands the story of Solomon and sacrificial love. She finds Alex in the end, and they both admit they love each other and promise to find each other after the attack is over.[<br /><br />Ms. Oliver leaves the ending open to interpretation. The walls are broken down between the Wilds and ordered society, both literally and figuratively. All of the characters have lost so much; so many of their family and friends. But we know in the end, they will go on. They will be OK. (hide spoiler)] (hide spoiler)] (hide spoiler)] (hide spoiler)o much; so many of their family and friends.

B00821OX98|4.0|Another sci-fi its ok if you just want a new movie to watch different characters but same story line basically but still ok to watch
B009UNGYHG|5.0|At first glance it appears to be an over priced carrying case, but is actually a charger with built in battery.  I gave it as a gift and the recipient is quite pleased with it.
B007SGM084|5.0|As I read this series I found myself diving into the world of Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey. I have yet to find any other book that can rival this series. Filled with fun, love, passion and adventure this story will have you up all night trying to figure out what's going to happen next.
B0008KLVG4|4.0|It's a classic in every sense of the word. Superb  storytelling, great cinematography.  Wonderful performances.  I hate horror films, and I still like this one. Go figure.  But that should tell you something.
B0063IH60K|5.0|FUN !  A nice way to pass the time when sitting in a waiting room.  It is very easy to play.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Love Doris Kearns Goodmwin, I am ashamed to admit that I am still reading this book a year later. I love it but I often do that with history books. It took me 5 years to read her book on FDR No ordinary Time which is fantastic. So far I am loving the book though.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Very good read! I really enjoyed how each character was developed.  Interesting sense of justice and how it plays out.
1439127727|5.0|Wow! what a power house of human interest and history.  Written very well and moves along quickly.  I anjoyed the history and relationships to the country and to one another.
B004R13U6Y|1.0|I was looking for a different pdf reader that would scroll down between pages instead of right like in the default, and I came upon this really bad app. The moment I knew i made a mistake was when I went into text reflow (new) mode and had to reinstall it to get out of the mode. Oops, they forgot to put a link back to the settings menu in the new text reflow mode.  Another annoying thing is the page viewer thing along the bottom is really slow and doesn't tell you which actual pages they are like most pdf viewers do.
1416511946|5.0|I couldn't wait to get this book, as I am a huge Motley Crue fan!! Once I started reading this book I couldn't put it down.  Nikki Sixx tells us of his amazing journey and his amazing survival. Genius!! If you are a Motley fan this is a must read.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|my favorite game by far I love the whole game and I could play it forever I play this on long trips

B007ZGO7EM|4.0|It's free and it works. No need to pay for something more expensive.  Size and ease of use are good.  Highly recommend this product.  Worth twice the price.

B007IXWL2C|1.0|So glad they are finally over! This series just got worse and worse! This last one I could hardly even read; just the same old boring stuff over and over. Of course there were a couple of surprising events.. well sort of.. I just had to know what was in store for this couple, but this book just dragged. I skimmed through most of the pages except for the more important stuff which is few and far between.<br />I'm so glad I can finally move on to something else with more depth!!! Sorry but I'm happy to finally be done with them. If you're like me and have to know the ending... you will read this book in complete boredom just like I did, and somehow manage to read all the way through. But for those of you who do not have to know what happens next pass this book and don't book back. This book is nothing to rant and rave about at all. In the end it is up to you; good luck!!!

B003O86FMW|5.0|This was my favorite book out of all three books, if the hunger games series.i won't say much to ruin the book but this was like the 8th time I read the book and the first time I read it till know I could not stop. Along with the movie it is a great book hope you enjoy.......
0316055433|2.0|If this were a terrible writer then I would have just tossed the book aside, but I love Donna Tartt. My real question was--where was the editor???
0446554995|5.0|This is one of a trilogy involving Helen's apparent death in Africa. For over a decade, For over a decade, Pendergast tries to solve the mystery of what happened to Helen, identify the villains, and find motives. Vincent helps track information. Good story that reads with the style and character of other books in the series. Made me feel comfortable and excited to read a new entry in a long series.
B00FRQ32N4|3.0|Fun for substitute game and it is fun for when you are bored. There is only a few playing time which sucks.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This app is so fun. I can't keep my eyes off it every one should have this app.Kids love the game and it helps the spell.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Veronica Roth has done it again!  She has created yet another amazing book that kept me entertained the entire time I was reading, but seriously why do  so many people have to die especially Uriah and Tris.  I was bawling my eyes out... the feels guys.  It is like she thought oh  you like this character well now they are gonna die.  This book was very sad but it was a great conclusion to the best trilogy I have ever read.
B00BJ9VBLI|3.0|Ok game, tons of glitches and difficulty level doesn't really  increase. That being said, great game to pass the time and entertaining.
B00E9A656K|5.0|So great! I download it and I was blown away at the graphics!! The controls are a little too easy but you can get the hang of it! I  recommended it! 5 stars from me and I can't wait for CSR Racing 2!!
B0081336FO|5.0|Well acted, exciting action, well designed plots. This season was excellent and leaves we hoping the third season is on Amazon soon.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this game. I DONT STOP PLAYING THIS<br />KEEP THE GREAT GAMES COMING.<br />BUT IT JUSS NEEDS MORE KEYS AND MAKE THEM EASIERNTO WIN OR GET.
B00BGI08GG|1.0|I'm honestly confused by all the glowing praise this show has received. I'm even more perplexed that it received a second season. I *TRIED* to watch this show. I like DC, I like the Green Arrow, I thought maybe, just maybe, there was finally some quality programming that wasn't on a premium cable channel. I was mistaken. I understand liberties being taken, really that didn't bother me as much as the juvenile dialogue and story arch. Steven Amell was fine as Oliver, but then it's not like he has much to work with. The only actor worth his salt on the show is Paul Blackthorne and his screen time is minimal. Rather than focusing on things like plot and story, they focus on the love interest between Laurel and Oliver and of course Laurel and Tommy. Because love triangles are in and sexy...<br /><br />The show is written and produced for a teenage audience. Any older fans should give up hopes of a decent DC show and proceed with caution. It's fluff and not even well done fluff.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is hilarious way better than temple run, the minion character s are funny and there are 3 different levels I love this game.
B000QCS9NM|3.0|I enjoyed reading this like I enjoy fast food.  It's not something I want to eat often, but it's exactly what I want when I want it.  Sometimes life gets too &#34;sticky-sweet&#34;, and you just want something gritty and full of the schmutz of life.  Chuck Palahniuk always pulls through for me.  Also, try his &#34;Stranger than Fiction&#34;, it's really interesting to read, and doable in &#34;bites&#34;
B009NF54ZE|3.0|Not as good as other hidden object adventures. Story was weak, puzzles very repetitive, silhouettes distorted ... Don't even look like on screen object in some cases.
0740748475|1.0|This is horribly cheap imported junk that comes with a poorly glued binding falling apart with first use.<br /><br />The binding is attached with rubber cement and will pull off easily.<br /><br />The binding paper is SUPER cheap, tears easily, and has rumpled back spine edges - a reflection of poor gluing during manufacture.<br /><br />The folio box that holds the three box is defective - too small - you must turn the box upside down and take out all three books to remove a single book. It is almost impossible to put the last book back the folio box - you have to pry open the warped edge and almost force it back in. BUYER BEWARE!<br /><br />Bill Watterson would not be happy about this...
B00BATG18K|1.0|I have enjoyed some Amy Tan novels but this certainly is not one of them.  The plot is as old as the hills - young, arrogant girl falls on hard times and slides into the depths of cruel men and cold hearted madams, blah, blah, blah.  The one dimensional plot is matched by the one dimensional characters, none of whom are likable nor interesting.  Why they are the way they are goes unexplored as do plot narratives which seem to have been used only to get from point a to point b.  Perhaps the most irritating part of this very irritating book is the use of coy terms for sexual organs.  Men's stems are constantly entering gates of delight with glances at pink pearls guarding those gates, well you get the idea!  The exception is the use of the word \\"pudendum\\" which stands in stark grabbed, rubbed, squeezed, contrast to the stems, pearls, gates, etc.  This is a too long book, about too little happening, to self absorbed people who never touch, never mind grab, your attention.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|A real page turner. Had me hooked from about 50 pages in. Recommended if you like King. Abra is my hero!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I'm a late bloomer on this series.  Rented some DVD's  from our public library, hard to get the full series.<br /><br />6 new episodes, that's what you get per year.  It's good to keep us guessing.  Anticipation is the key to life.  Don't we all look forward to the next experience of life.  Waiting is part of the story.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|It works well and installs easily. If you keep it plugged in, your internet service might require a daily reset of the router because your service can detect it and if it's inactive they don;t want it on the system. Just unplug it if you don't want to reset the router overnight. Also ITUNES doesn't like it unless you load songs ONE AT A TIME. VIDEOS run well and anything that you can run on your web command line looks and sounds OK. The quality can be 1080 most of the time. The streaming stuff works OK. I recommend it if you're not too particular. GAMESTERS beware! Don't know about all that...$35 isn't much for something that works well.
B00BATG18K|3.0|This book was a bit of a disappointment.  I have become accustomed to such quality from Amy Tan and I didn't feel like this matched her other books.
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|I just purchased this app and every time I went to open it it closed. I am very disappointed and am mad. I love games that hunt and this is the &quot;top rated&quot; one and it wont even open.
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|This is not any where close to being as good as a good Swedish police procedural.  The hero is not believable, the violence is excessive and also unbelievable.  The love affair was not overdone but was unrealistic also.  The pace is very fast
B000XUBFE2|5.0|A heart wrenching story told in exquisite language. I couldn't put it down. It made me weep for the beautifully crafted characters and for the extraordinarily beautiful language. Five stars.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This thing is awesome - I know, I know, it does what a Roku does. BUT, it does it in a much smaller and easily portable format and it just works - all for $35 or less! Install was a breeze and I am thrilled to have this in my house. I just bought a third one. Funny thing is, some of our tvs are smart TVs and that is all good, but the Chromecast gives me the option to take streaming to hotels, transfer around rooms of my house (VERY useful when you have company) and just generally saves me a lot of effort of having to find a place to watch some of my streamable TV (or radio). I am really hoping to ditch cable TV at some point and this little guy will be instrumental in getting me there.
B00CMAK34O|5.0|She may not be your favorite but you can not deny her impact on the world of music. What is there to say about Agnetha.  Great work from a superstar. Voice that is a gift from heaven. Great music and lyrics. This was so well worth the wait that we had to hear her again.
B0086HGW42|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums - great mix of pop, ballad, even a rap style song. Ed Sheeran has a beautiful voice and some haunting lyrics - recommend this to all my friends and can't want for next album.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This really works well for a variety of surfaces. I bought a couple of these to carry in various places.
B00CO52NLI|4.0|This game is very fun. You take care of animals and get the animals adopted. I recommend this app if you love animals. I would tell you the order, but I don't want to spoil it. Their are optional goals and goals you need to do to get to the next step. The in app purchasing is for optional animals like cats and reptiles. Overall, this is a fun game for everyone in the family.
B00ABKGG0C|4.0|this is a good book.  it has some of the familiar elements of sword & sorcery novels but it avoids the boring formula that has become so much a part of the genre.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft PE is pretty much the best game in the universe. Me and my friend play together a lot. If you want to battle dangerous monsters or build a majestic castle, Minecraft PE is the game for you. Only one thing, when will 0.8.0 be out?

B007TNS6JI|4.0|Just a great hack and slash game with plenty of loot.  Good for passing the time.  Easy enough to level and has a multiplayer option, to play with others online.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game, it's addictive. Wish you didn't have to pay for lives and things but it's a lot of fun!
1400079276|5.0|Beautiful. Challenging. Engrossing. Uplifting. Confusing. All of these words could be used to describe Kafka on the Shore, but there is one that I think can't be denied--masterpiece.<br /><br />This is the story of a young man who runs away from home, but it is so much more than that. It's hard to describe what's going on in Kafka on the Shore, particularly since so much of the magical realism obscures reality and leaves the reader to decide exactly what is real and what is in the imagination of the various characters. I know that might seem like a negative--before reading the book, I certainly would have said it was--but I can assure you that it is not. There are moments of true emotion in Kafka on the Shore, and there were times when I was deeply moved not only by the beauty of the prose--a tribute to both the author and the translator--but also the beauty of the ideas. And that is a rare thing indeed.<br /><br />This was my first foray into Murakami. It will not be my last.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|You should totally get this game it is so awesome but wish ad free cost nothing but oh well i can live with adds for an awesome game
B005CRQ2Y4|5.0|A terrific little book that I enjoyed far more than I expected. I'm sure there are all sorts of subtext that the post-modernists professors love to pour over. For me, taken at face-value, it was an interesting detective story, as our fearless heroine attempts to make sense of an ages old conspiracy--involving the mail, no less--and how it continues to this day. Looking a level deeper, it is the story of a suburban housewife who is given the chance to have an adventure and runs with it. How much of what she sees is reality and how much is in her own head? Impossible to say, but the mystery only makes the mystery that much more enjoyable.
B004W2UBYW|3.0|The book reads well and it has information that was not known to me before reading it.  All together, interesting book.
0316069906|5.0|Written with facts but reads like a novel.  It was very informative without being over the top.  i'm a veg and gave it to my husband to read (he's meat eater) because it touches on many of the issues that make me an ethical vegetarian.
B00A8MGLAI|3.0|This movie is very hard to follow.  Should have rented it instead of buying.  Tried to see it through once and will try to stay awake for the entire movie next time.
B00F14IL06|5.0|I got mine at target for a lot better price. It was only $21 and I love her to pieces, the only down fall is I can't dress her up because my othe monster high doll outfits are too small. But other then that she is a really great doll
B009MO57H6|1.0|one word disaster!. I loved the first 3 movies, however this one is just DISASTER!. They had combined 1, 2, and 3rd movies into 5. Bad move.
B003U7RP80|4.0|Great old classic stuff! Many modern musicians took to heart the lessons taught by this musician. One of the originators.
B00B4FU6KE|5.0|This book is wise, witty, charming, painful, smart, and altogether entertaining. (I am such a huge fan of Karen Joy Fowler, anyway. If you ever have opportunity to hear her speak, do not pass it up. You will laugh until your face hurts.) In We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves I unsuspectingly read along before I was hit with the realization she had slid between the lines the real and actual truth of sibling and parental relationships--my relationships. This is her best story yet--and that's saying a lot.

B00ELXQYOI|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was well written and takes you on a tour of Jony Ive's life from child prodigy to now the world's best known and most respected industrial designer. After reading this book, it is easy to see the synergies between Jonny Ive and Steve Jobs. Both have or had the ability to see the big picture as well as the minute details. Both are or were perfectionists, on a mission to create a better product and provide a better experience. Both are or were concerned about the invisible details as much as those things that are visible. The partnership they formed literally changed the world. And the creative genius that made Apple what it is today is still there, answerable to nobody else. And that creative genius, encoraged and supported by Jobs when he was alive, is Jony Ive.<br /><br />Clearly Jony has a healthy ego, unsurpassed power and influence within Apple, and a wonderful lifestyle, which he truly deserves. But he also comes across as a genuinely nice guy who gives credit to others as much as himself, and will go the extra mile in anything he does.<br /><br />What impressed me most is that Jony is much more than 'just' a designer. He is an innovator in production techniques as well and has come up with some amazing innovations like the Apple Unibody process that have revolutionised fit, finish and reliability on volume produced products. I had always imagined that another group of engineers would have been responsible for these aspects, but no it is all part of Jony's design process ... And is all the more impressive for that.<br /><br />I was also hugely impressed by Jony's drive to make everything tactile and emotionally engaging. It is a characteristic that runs through all of his designs, and you see it in all the products he has designed or overseen in his time at Apple. You see it too in the Apple stores, where people are encouraged to be hands on. It is a lesson that everyone in business could and should learn, and I am tempted tobuy copies of this book for all my clients because if they could truly understand this one thing and bake it into everything they do, they would deliver better products and services to their customers. Their customers would then develop a deeper emotional engagement, leading to more loyalty and unstoppable word of mouth ... All things for which Apple sets the benchmark. And for which Jony Ive has been responsible.<br /><br />I thoroughly recommend this book to anyone both to better understand the true genius of Jony Ive, and yes there is no doubt that he IS a genius at what he does, and the lessons you can take away and apply in your own life. Thank you Leander Kaheny for writing it so well.
B00FATEJYE|4.0|OK so here is the deal.  This is an absolute fantastic game, and I have spent many, many hours playing it.  The game is your standard swipe motion, however with so many unlockables and such, it makes for one hell of a ride.<br /><br />However here is the negative, and this is crucial if your considering downloading this.  If you have this on another device, more specifically the Ipad or Iphone, DO NOT GET THIS VERSION!!  I did not realizing that not everything is attached to your WB Id as one would have hoped.  Instead the game is stored to the device, so any progress made, any characters bought, powered up ect is essentially lost if you want to play on this device.  In fact when I logged onto the ID on here all it did was give me some of the unlockables from playing the console version (Batman Beyond and Prison Superman for example).  So that said I sadly can't play on here because I would have to start from scratch.  That said, if you haven't played this game yet, you will enjoy it.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|One of the best books I've read in a long time. And I read a lot of books. Couldn't put it down.
B003UESJH4|5.0|Since I have vocal problems also, I thought Colin Firth did a magnificent job portraying a stammerer, or stutterer, or whatever the King's problem was.  And how stress made it worse.  And the heart break of having your brother mock your speech.  Timothy Spall's portrayal of Winston Churchill's compassion was beautiful.  The way he acted like things were normal when he was talking about when Albert became king all the while as the mere subject matter made Bertie totally unable to get the words out.  Helena Bonham Carter's characterization of Elizabeth's caring nature for her husband and his problem was perfect.  If I could rate it six stars, I would.
B00EEDNA4M|1.0|I just want to conquer with all the reviews that say this is far too overpriced. I love the series, but for $200... not worth it. Not to mention netflix has almost all the series on instantque. Im very disappointed in AMC to create such a rip-off deal.
142332241X|5.0|Very good . I am a big fan of Amy.  I love the use of intergenerational  subjects, and story lines.
B0085YOD1A|4.0|It's a good battery app that does the job. I wouldn't call it anything special. I got the app when it was free, however I'm not sure if it's worth $1. Doesn't give you that much more info. However it's good when you want to know exactly how much battery life you have

B00GX59QO2|5.0|so fun, fast moving, lots of laughs, not sure what will happen next, and the ending just fine and spectacular
B00FEHXISA|4.0|Excellent sequel to a sequel.  The chemistry between Downey & Paltrow continues. Sassy, fun, with a serious note. Good action without swamping the plot.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I like the product, but Google needs to step up with having more software capabilities associated with it.  The web casting is choppy but I don't know if it is the device or my WiFi system.
B00EVW0SA0|1.0|Too distracted by the obvious fact that they hired a 7 year old to handle all the military aspects of this film. You can only suspend reality until they start using Javelins to shoot down helicopters. As for the plausibility to take the white house hostage, I would say the creativity is 0, but that would be a miscarriage of justice to all individuals with 0 creativity. The creativity and any attempt to connect with reality was aborted and buried 6 feet under before the first line of script was even written.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Oops I posted about Allegiant on the book Road to Allegiant. Still feel the same Bad ending! You don't kill off the main character and then drag out the ending of the book!
0790731509|5.0|One of the best ever! May have been the first major star to take on the &#34;anti-hero&#34; role, and it didn't go over well at the box office. This one hit tv quickly. I first saw it on the Sunday Late Show and it stayed with me. Some real lessons in being who you are and trying to get by when you aren't like everyone else. George Kennedy got a well-deserved Oscar as &#34;Dragline,&#34; and I don't think Newman was even nominated.<br />Still a great film!
B004R13U6Y|5.0|Basically this PDF Reader has so many options it blows the Kindle's built in PDF Reader out of the water. Gobs and gobs of options, the only downside is it is rather slow when finding your page at some distance into the work.
B00003CXS4|5.0|&#34;Snatch,&#34; is a little known gem! This comic crime caper is a riot!<br />Great cast and some hilarious performances. Brad Pitt is a scream!
B00B5HQL50|5.0|Gone are the cheesy, cheeky, clunky one liners and misogynistic philandering. Enter the new era of Bond with the third installment of the rebirth of the awesome Anglo agent. This third Daniel Craig headlining flick completes the arc the began with Casino Royale--in which he made his first kill, completed his first mission, and bedded his first babe. In Skyfall, the ultra-modernized MI6 has come full circle to the beginning of the franchise.<br /><br />I went back and forth about liking this installment. At first, as a long time super-fan, I loved the new interpretation of the celluloid super-spy, but Skyfall left me flat. Now that I've viewed the film a number of times, there are many more elements I like than those I don't. As an example of what I didn't like: I never think it is that clever to have a villain be at the finish line before the hero starts the race. Everything the good guys did were anticipated well before the scenario began--which is why Bond and his fellow MI6-ers play into the hands of Silva with anything they do. That type of plot device is nearly as maddening as any of Lucille Ball's comedic devices. But, the heart that 007 shows is grand in scope and his passion and loyalty to his work is beyond compare. His resourcefulness is far more interesting than his former reliance on gadgets. And I had such a laugh--and well deserved drool--with the reintroduction of the DB3 from Dr. No.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Great game until you lose 500 + lives..that's Horrible and it happens no matter what platform you play on...Apple or Android<br />At least it is available on Kindle Fire HD now
B00F880BWG|5.0|I'd walk a mile through biters, geeks, walkers, and test subjects to see the next episode of The Walking Dead. A character-driven drama set inside the zombie-apocalypse, TWD delivers a unique perspective on the human condition. Whether the heroes struggle with survival against nature, man, or un-dead, virtually every literary theme is employed to illustrate the challenge for our enjoyment.<br /><br />Or, I'm just talking out of my tooter.
B000FC1JCQ|5.0|I have read this book 4 times now over a span of 30 years.  Each time it has a different meaning.  It seems to grow with my own life experiences.  The best Avalon story that I have every read.
B00EY7MFKS|5.0|Lots of fun if you don't over think it. VTOL Globemaster and vintage Corvette are clever and implausible. The show is imaginative, inventive, and irascible. It has a bit of growing to do, but the characters are engaging enough.
B0046B3QTG|4.0|Great for the kids. Good soundtrack by Pharell as well!! The scenes keeps the kids interested and the storyline is cute.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The first person narrative limited character development but overall a good story.  This also seems to excuse some illogical points that would have lead to this type of economic and political structure.  Flaws but not heinous and moving past them leaves an enjoyable novel.
0316204366|1.0|Just a re-write of other people's work...save your money.<br />It is in recycle bin...where it belongs.  Too bad, good topic
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Over the years I have read all of this series.  I was happy to finally see a conclusion to the lives of the series' many characters.  Brandon Sanderson is to be commended for his skill in completing Robert Jordan's tremendous saga.
B00E9ZATTY|5.0|great movie to air down and enjoy with my grandson, never got up from the chair he wanted to watch it again. will wait for another day
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME! I was switching back and forth from my phone and my laptop while waiting for lives on one device to renew. Now I can add my Kindle to that rotation! *Happy dance, happy dance* Ok...now I have jellies to eliminate!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Can't wait to see it on tv or missed it??? This is for you!<br /><br />Now, I Can't wait til next season.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Awesome book! Really enjoyed it. Very interesting. I really like how it is written. Easy to follow and very addicting.

B00ERIUO02|4.0|Since so much of the music sounds so eerily and objectively similar,it is all too easy to discount all contemporary American pop music as a waste of ones time. There are however artists in this arena who are giving more than the expected to the public they musically serve. While Katy Perry is surely among them,the one thing I've always taken issue with her about is that her music is uneven. Especially with the case of her previous album [[ASIN:B003L77TZI Teenage Dream]],she definitely came off as a bit of a singles artist in terms of musical inventiveness. In terms of albums,she definitely tended to chase trends rather than set them. Her melodic,hook filled sound is ripe for many variations. And on this album there is a sense she's starting to realize that more fully.<br /><br />  \\"Roar\\",\\"Legendary\\" and \\"Dark Horse\\",the (thankfully) one song featuring a guest rapper-in this case Juicy J all sound on the surface exactly what you'd expect from 21'st century pop. Though they seem to revel in their cliches instrumentally,Katy's songwriting and vocal arrangement benefit from a genuine move away from Western pop music structures and more towards more East Indian/Asian styles of harmony and melodicism. \\"Birthday\\" and \\"International Smile\\" are both joyous uptempo songs with a funky dance flavor-full of horn and guitar breaks that I've heard referred to as \\"nu disco\\". It's the sound that seems to most suit Perry creatively and these two very welcomed inclusions are two of my favorites here. \\"Walking On Air\\" has a thick house flavor while \\"Unconditionally\\",\\"Ghost\\",\\"Love Me\\",\\"Double Rainbow\\" and \\"By The Grace Of Good\\" are all elaborate electronic epic pop with multiple sections-some soft,some very dramatic.<br /><br />  \\"This Moment\\" is another favorite of mine-showcasing a stripped down bass synthesizer based new wave/funk groove that she also goes into on a slower and more grooving sense on \\"This Is How We Do\\".-this time with more elaborate production. The one thing that makes this one of Katy Perry's stronger album statements is that the lyrics and music all reflect a great deal of musical growth. She openly sings about her needs and insecurities in a manner that's not only appealing from her but also generationally educational. By continuing to delve into her own influence from classic soul music of melding the secular and the religious almost seamlessly,she reminds herself and everyone else that if life is the game,the best play to make is to be open to others emotionally-not merely live for and within yourself. While no one,myself included,would likely consider Katy Perry a particularly soul oriented artist,that particular influence seems to play well with Perry's songwriting,lyrics and general musicality. Overall? Likely her strongest album to date.es this one of Katy Perry's stronger album statements is that the lyrics and music all reflect a great deal of musical growth.

0804161380|5.0|JUST AMAZING! I didn't expect each guide to come with the special maps or extras that went with them on the original prints. I just knew I was getting guides, a fancy bookmark and fancy box. This is the set for the die hard. I'm super excited and glad I purchased this!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|It is nice to read about a true life account during WWII that had such a wonderful ending.  Two men who were so different, could after the war call each other brothers.
0804162727|5.0|Awesome! Bought it for my collection and for the artwork. Also got the Game Guide Box Set. I just opened the book and it is just beautiful. Link to The Past is my favorite Zelda game and I was SUPER excited when I found out about A Link Between Worlds. I was even MORE excited when I saw I got a framed lithograph with the book! Excellent quality for such a great price. The foiled crest on the frame is a beautiful touch especially since that kind of design is pretty fancy and can be expensive. LOVE!
0064430170|5.0|Goodnight Moon is a favorite children's picture book.  I purchased it for a new mother to read to her child.
B002XXUWMI|5.0|On the edge of your seat, never a dull moment, science fiction noir, dream-like, is it reality or a dream?. Loved Kiefer Sutherland's &#34;mad doctor&#34; character, helping the  aliens' experiments with human subjects by rearranging their memories and the shape of the city landscape nightly.
B008Y7N7JW|1.0|Story was too much fantasy. Lack of realistic feeling reduced my enjoyment of the story. I wouldn't recommend this movie.
B0084BMUFA|3.0|I thought that this was a great read and very touching. It taught me a great lesson. I also think that Charles did a great job with giving this book a universal theme and it will be able to keep through the generations.
B001706I5I|1.0|I do not like this version of Dr. Seuss How The Grinch Stole Christmas. The old original cartoon version is my favorite.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This app is perfect. One star ratings are not possible. It takes a while to download  but it is worth the wait. I'm every happy that they made this app for kindle fire and kindle fire HD
B009YP9L7U|2.0|The storyline just wasn't captivating enough. It was not interesting enough to keep me hooked. A bleak and bland read.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|One of my favorite books of the last 10 years. I could not put it down. Be warned, it is a tear jerker, but the story is wonderful.
1858707536|5.0|My first review, so here goes-<br /><br />Short version, just get it.<br /><br />Time to waste version -I've been waiting for years for the long overdue, remastered, early Rick Wakeman CDs. Seriously, when is this going to happen? (I'm excluding the 2009 Japanese releases as they were limited editions and no longer available)<br /><br />Now I'm sure the purists will lynch me for this, but this version is better. While faithful to the original recording (ie, the Minimoog has not been replaced and orchestrations haven't been radically re-written), there is and extra 17 minutes which was not going to fit onto LP. Although the 1973 recording is inprinted onto my brain, the new bits don't seem out of place. You may even, as I did, call out &#34;new bit&#34; to anyone that would listen. Having said that, the girl singing seemed a little out of place at first. Ashley Holt (vocals) seems to be the only other survivor from the original and the narrator, British actor Peter Egan, sounds a little like Patrick Stewart.<br /><br />At time of writing, it is only available as the 'fan pack' with the not-going-to-fit-into-my-CD-rack mini hard-cover, digipak type, book and 130 page magazine from Classic Rock magazine. With any luck, it may still be available direct from their website.<br /><br />Maybe I don't want 'Six Wives', 'Arthur', etc, remastered anymore. Maybe I want, if they are going to be this good, re-recordings instead.
6302990114|5.0|In perfect condition, thank you.  Really enjoyed it twice already.  Wonderful acting, characters, costumes, scenery, clever dialogue, and stirring music.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|My wife ordered and read this book and she really enjoyed it. Classic Grisham story telling well told. Worth reading.
B006LS7DQE|4.0|I have a 2nd Gen Kindle Fire. It did not run all that great on the device, which us a shame because it's a great game otherwise.
B00A46H3J6|5.0|One of the best records ever made. If you don't own it then stop reading reviews and just buy it.
B001QB5S3G|1.0|This should be an R-rated movie --- not PG.  Full of nudity, much more than the average movie.  And full of violence, blood and guts.<br /><br />And don't be fooled by its title.  The movie has little to do with actually portraying a life hidden in Christ to the point of being found worthy to suffer for His sake.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|Flight is a very good movie. Denzel Washington gives a great performance. His portrayal of the pilot was very true and real.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|I tried to play it and it wouldn't work I used to play it all the time  but now it will get to the gameloft screen then it stops.
0399243631|5.0|My son and I love Spot!! We have fun reading this story, and the flaps make it even more entertaining!!
B008476HBM|5.0|I have always loved this book every sense I first read it in Junior High School.<br />Jane Austen was writing the story the same way people use to write letters. It is very descriptive. She make you feel like you are part of the story.
006202406X|4.0|Five houses, all alike in dignity,<br />In old Chicago, where we lay our scene,<br />From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,<br />Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.<br />From forth the fatal loins of these five foes,<br />A pair of star-crossed lovers make their life;<br />Her misadventur’d piteous overthrow,<br />Doth with her death bury the civil strife . . .<br /><br />(Romeo & Juliet)<br /><br />A reminder that young, beautiful and courageous heroines in great literature don't always survive to live happily ever after. What happened to Tris, her choices and their outcome, were a surprise to me and saddened me but are consistent with her character -- Dauntless and Abnegation both -- and therefore satisfying.<br /><br />Victoria Roth is a good writer, not (yet) a great writer. But she is a great story-teller and does a fine job of creating characters with whom we identify. This book's plot in particular, in its last half, moves like a freight train. Recommended.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|When I try and o the update I get an error message that says a version of candy crush comes preinstalled on this device (which it doesn't) and that the update can't be preformed on my kindle fire hd (last year's model) please help!!!!!
0385484518|5.0|This was an amazing story. Everyone should read this book. The message really hits home and will make you think about life.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This is a good game to play. I have a cousin that is 7 an  he play it all the time
161218412X|5.0|Teen daughter loves Sherlock Holmes and has been asking for the books for her own (as opposed to library books) because she loved reading them so much.  We found this set on Amazon and will be giving it to her for Christmas.  When it arrived we were impressed with the quality of the books and the case.  The case is magnetized to hold the flap closed, and it is nice that the flap does not go over the other edge and will therefore slide nicely onto shelf.  I think she will be very satisfied with this gift.<br /><br />Update:  Teen daughter squealed with delight upon opening this gift.  Has begun to read the books again.  Very nice set overall and made a Sherlock fan very happy.
B00GME9AJK|5.0|This movie was one of the best movies I've ever seen. This is an absolutely great movie you should buy it!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm not very far.But,I have been getting far. Level 18 is the one I'm on right now. There are these things called jelly levels and ingredients levels.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Very fun game. I'm at level 11 and still have had no need to use real money. I love making things and selling them to real people for loads of gold. Exploring is also great cause you never know what you will uncover. You level up quiet fast and with each level you can do New and fun stuff. I recommend this game to everyone.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Simple and addictive. Not much to it but not much more u could ask for from a free and entertaining time killer. Its free, the worst u could do is get it, decide its not for u, and delete it. Same as TRIALS for XBOX but ur driving a truck with a limp-necked redneck driver. In my opinion its worth the time.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game so much! It is easy at the begining, but gets addictive at the end. I play it under my covers at night and don't stop till day!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|really solid movie about a hidden true story. really well done.  took me back to the 70's. very exciting true life drama
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Great graphics, entertaining, and fun. Worth the download especially considering its a free download and ad free. Overall, love it.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I really LIKED this book...not LOVED it because to do that I would have to call myself a masochist...LOL. I feel like &#34;I&#34; just stepped out of the fighting ring after finishing this one...it left me exhausted, wiped out and bloodied...had to check myself for bruises...geez!<br />Travis and Abby...confused young couple....she's supposed to be a &#34;sweet&#34; girl but nope..she's not really...just trying to be someone different than the background she's running from...being a virgin doesn't make you sweet. Travis is one hot (and hot tempered) young man who never sleeps with the same girl twice (uses them like tissues...once and throw away)...but of course they meet and fall in love.<br />There are parts of this book that I loved and made me fall in love with love but most of the time it was damned painful to read...how many times can a girl change her mind and heart in one book and have the reader still rooting for her. I got so angry at how wishy washy Abby was written at times, I wanted to yell at my kindle...lol...but then again, it is after all fiction, and therefore we need to suspend all sense of reality to enjoy it. Travis was such an angry young man...but also I have seen how some girls can manipulate a guy emotionally to the point where he just loses his mind and goes off the deep end...much like what happens in this book.<br />All this to say, I really am glad I finally got to read this much talked about book...I found the $7 kindle price way too steep and had it sitting in my wishlist, but grabbed it when it went on sale this week. No doubt Jamie McGuire can write a very entertaining story and I'm relieved there was an HEA of sorts at the end of this one.<br /><br />****4**** stars instead of 5 because it caused me some seriously emotionally painful moments =)
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this app! its a calculator 4 the go! I'm soo glad 2 get this app. good thing I have this when I don't have an actual calculator so I am able 2 count my money in the nick of time! LOL!!!!!!
B0010SKUYM|4.0|Unlike many books of this genre this book changes perspectives, voices and times. The writing and story are superb but after completing the first book I feel no closer to understanding the narrative be. Compelled to buy the next book I fear the details of the first while creating a rich world were not necessary to progress the plot.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Music and graphics are scientifically designed to keep you blending between plays. I am glad I get stuck and can take a break.
B00E8S2KV2|5.0|This movie is a prelude to &#34;The Lord Of The Rings&#34; trilogy released a few years ago.  It is the story of how the Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, got the ring that was the cause of action in the trilogy.  This movie, not quite as good as the trilogy, is one of the greatest movies of the modern era and a joy to watch.  It deserves the highest highest possible recommendation and will be rewatched by a very large audience for many, many years to come.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Have been waiting for candy crush to be available on the kindle for a long time.  Spool happy it's finally here!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Very good fast paced never put it down reading. Even though the book deals mostly with children it is definitely a good read for adults.
1616890835|5.0|From a small stencil cutter, to airbrushes, pinstriping, and now this sign book.  My playing around with these &#34;tools&#34; has given me an appreciation for the artists who work with these mediums.  This book is gorgeous, written with some humor, great photos and stories.  I really like this book.
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|One of the best kids movies I've ever seen. Love it for kids and adults! Helped my 9 year old consider rebelieving?
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|Possibly one of Eminem's best albums.  A perfect mix of old style with new rock/pop beats!  If you like hip hop, like eminem, or just like music there is a track on this album for you.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|I just didn't like the app.  I did not really understand how to play the game.  Furthermore it did not get a very good rating.
B005KA188S|5.0|It's a fun horror movie for people who don't usually like horror movies and David Tennant is amazing in his supporting role.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|It was the best application I have bought.  I is really neat the way it works on the Kindle I purchased sometime ago.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|If your a shark fan you will definitely want to get this!Even if you aren't though it's still a pretty good game! Also it's free!definitely deserves 5 stars!So hurry and get this game!
0439023513|5.0|I gave this is a gift so I can only provide hearsay, and that is that it is a fabulous read!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This whole series was great, especially this book. But I have to warn you that if you don't like unhappy endings then you don't want to read it. I found out the hard way, and am disappointed that such a great and moving story didn't have the happy ending I imagined.(or any happy ending for that matter)
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Easy to program and use.  Simple yet effective.  Wakes me up every day.  I love the way it starts softly and gets louder when ignored.  The snooze feature works as well.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|So fun, and free and addicting! Minions are hilarious and the holiday add ons are great. Go download it you!
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|the game is nothing more than a gimmick to have users spend money on bonus items and upgrades.  The candy items are difficult to differentiate one from the other.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Loved reading this trilogy.  Very creative story telling and excellent character development.  I would recommend this writer for all readers.
1932907009|1.0|This is not a screenwriting book per se. There's never really a point in which Snyder sits down and tells you anything about writing. This book is primarily about selling your screenplay, and making it the formulaic dribble that will sell to the big time producers in Hollywood.  &#34;Snyder's Beats&#34; is a very common thing now, so much so that everyone uses it and every movie feels exactly the same, i.e. they're following the same formula.<br /><br />But that will never happen. You will never be able to get a Hollywood producers attention based on your script alone, no matter how formulaic you make it. It just doesn't work that way.<br /><br />At one point, Snyder literally says: &#34;screw Memento, let's talk about Miss Congeniality.&#34; On his blog he actually says &#34;you can learn more from Mall Cop than Memento&#34;! He argues that movies that try to get the audience to think are snobby and pretentious, and movies should be nothing more than popcorn entertainment. I was worried when his credits only included &#34;Stop Or My Mom Will Shoot&#34; and &#34;Blank Check&#34;, but after actually reading the book, the previous quote in particularity, I can't help but question Snyder's credibility.<br /><br />Long story short: if you want to sell formulaic/boring spec scripts and maybe get one or two made, then this is indeed the book for you. If you want to learn how to actually write screenplay's, and write them well, then look elsewhere.
0802407692|5.0|Got it for a gift for a couple getting married, the guy is in the army and will be deployed a lot. Learning to communicate in each others love language is very helpful.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I loved it from beginning to end.  It was really like visiting an old friend.  I wish it had gone an and told a bit more about Dan and his new family.  Especially his relationship with Abra.  Anyone who read The Shining should read this one.  It is excellent.l.p.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Can't even describe how engrossing this book is, how enjoyable it is, you're hooked from the start...a must read for sure.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I fell in love w/the first and after starting the 2nd, finished within two days. I didn't put  the book down. I am looking forward to reading about what happens a with Jace, Clary, Simon, and Luke in the next book and hopefully Clary' s mother will be awakened soon!
B00FY9JJYA|5.0|I loved the first &#34;Black Radio&#34; Robert Glasper nails it down on &#34;2&#34;...the song writing...the singing and the playing are all OUTSTANDING and validates his place among the new great artists...this is real music.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I don't usually review books, but feel the need to after this one... Before buying it I read many critiques and after reading it, all of those that are negative must come from people who don't like to think about what they are reading.  The story was not at all hard to follow and cohesive in a very intricate way.  Each chapter is told from a different perspective and all of them ultimately are critical to pari's life.  If we listen carefully to the story of our own lives, it could be told in much the same way.  This book is beautifully thought out and written, but you should save it for a day when you are ready to emerge yourself in a book and really read it!
006202406X|5.0|It's an okay book, I guess. I LOVED Divergent and Insurgent better though. That's for sure. There's way too much love between Tris and Tobias though. It's making me queasy.
B005MRXS78|2.0|The inside , like the plastic gears and rubber band pully, not so good ,wears down. The hold inside  mechanizm needed upgrade.
B00DHRLK84|3.0|Only the DVD is extended! WTF! Why wouldn't they mk the blu-ray extended too???  Read the description better.  In light of that the extended scenes do help the story and show a few details missed in the theatrical version.
B00E9ZATJO|1.0|DEFECTIVE MATERIAL__ HAD WANTED TO SEE THIS AND GOT ALL PREVIEWS AND NO REPEAT NO MOVIE  we are very disappointed and got three - dvd, blue ray, and game at Walmart for less than 10 dollars yesterday!!!!!!!!!
B00E8S2JZ4|5.0|Blu-ray picture quality is amazing.  If your a Hobbit fan this movie has extra scenes that you'll enjoy.  For those that have a passing interest it explains more of the story.
0380789035|5.0|Having always been a fan of Norse and other mythologies, I loved the hell out of American Gods. As an atheist, I enjoyed more contemporarily practiced religions being treated equally with the old gods. As for the new gods, they were perfect. Americans do seem to worship the Technical Boy, Media and the Highways.<br /><br />All in all I'm a picky reader, but Neil Gaiman totally earned the 5* rating!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it i am addected so much i would get it but i do need a lot more coins and gems
075669812X|5.0|My 7 year old has had a lot of enjoyment from this book. He dragged it to school daily for several months. The green ninja is cool, too :)
B00ESY77LO|3.0|i just could never get into the story. The movie was a little more interesting than the book. So I think had I liked the story the movie would have been good.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Notice that with the exception of youtube ... ALL THAT IT WILL PLAY IS PAID FOR CONTENT..... if you intend to spend money every time you want to watch something then this is for you ... i don't even get the point of it , you use your phone to buy content that you could buy from a store or rent from a store or right from your cable provider and it beams it to your TV ... THIS IS A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY . when i bought it i had the impression that i would be able to bean content from my phone to my tv , that IS NOT the case .... i wish i had waited longer for reviews to start coming in before ju,ping on this pre release .... I threw mine in the garbage
0374275637|2.0|I just couldn't get into what the purpose was for a whole book to be written with the information involved. Very dull reading for me.

B009A9ETFE|4.0|I've known of this band for quite awhile, but never bothered to listen to any of their music until now. I feel like kicking myself for not giving them a good listen years earlier. Very cool guitar riffs &  Valo's soothing voice; while he croons about doomed romance, makes this an underrated band that deserves much more attention. They blow away anything on mainstream pop radio. I for one will be checking them out more often.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|it is one of the best series i have ever seen because below the drama of a law firm and the excitement of a case every week,  one learns a bit about how the firm works and its inherent politics with everyone vying for position. The main characters are also developed to an incredible level.  i actually finding myself worrying about them after the show some times.

B00ESNE696|5.0|I suspect that the show has new writers this season. At any rate, the change has made a good show a much better and more interesting one. I'm excited to see how well Florrick and Agos can stand up to the big dog, &#34;LG&#34;. Will Diane jump ship and join Alicia and Carey? Will David Lee get put out to pasture or, better yet, fired?
B00CL0J99K|5.0|This movie received quit a bit of criticism due to the treatment of the Mandarin, but it made this longtime (over 30 years) fan smile. For me Downey Jr. is the only Tony Stark & I feel extremely sorry for the guy who will &#34;replace&#34; him someday.

B00GS1DM2S|5.0|Of the new evangelion movies that have been released, Eva 3.33 is by far the most provocative, revolutionary and complex. This new instalment courageously and completely deviates from the original plot, and the changes occurring in this movie are so daring and unexpected, that it will surely incite disappointment in the fans that expected something different. But for those, like me, who embrace a well executed apocalyptic vision, it comes to defy our notion of what evangelion is capable to do.<br />I really believe that Eva 3.33 is mostly about Shinji Ikari, in the sense that we are capable of identifying with his confusion and desperation. At the beginning of the movie, Shinji is awakened from a profound sleep that lasted 14 years and we see him trying to communicate with Misato(now captain) and with everyone that is currently under her command. Misato only answers his questions in a crude and dry manner and the rest of the crew ignore him as well, and when they actually look at him, it is with anger and resentment in their eyes. At this moment, Shinji can't understand why he is receiving this kind of cruel treatment. We sort of have an idea though, but we can still understand his utter confusion and anguish in that particular scenario. Also, while the movie progresses, we truly do care for him, and when he tries desperately to make things right  we can only hope that he actually vindicate himself to the world. I believe the movie succeeds in making us care about Shinji and, in my humble opinion, that is most important thing, because at the end, Shinji is the heart of this film.<br />Another aspect of this movie that most people seem to take for granted is the wonderful invention of the AAA Wunder. A miracle of engineering, the Wunder is a gigantic airship that uses the Eva Unit 01 as the main engine. And numerous screenings of this film will reveal how rich and detailed are the technical requirements necessary in order to make the AAA Wunder work. This is a delightful, imaginatively rich, and inventive fresh addition to the new eva series.<br />Maybe one of the reasons why I like this film so much has to do with the fact that I don't care about not having enough character development. Why should I? When I have already witnessed enough of it in the series where it has been taken to psychological extremes: the desperation, alienation, sexual frustration and in another note, the emotional pain that plagues the air at end of the original series and in the end of eva. Maybe many of the fans believe that the characters will have a different development, one that will be more gentle and agreeable. But I'll argue that this is not the strength and appeal of evangelion. If eva wants to inflict the same psychological impact, its characters must be flawed in their core and be traumatized by nightmarish events. Because, only the spiritually broken people deserve to inhabit this post-apocalyptic world.<br />Eva 3.33 gives us enmity, rivalry and hostility between their characters. Most of them are tired, bitter and angry(and with good reason). In this particular instalment, the negative emotions of its characters cast a different shadow
B006BDHAX0|5.0|Love this Mahjong but how change backgrounds? States on descriptions &#34;Choose from 12 backgrounds, including 4 with holiday themes&#34;, but no options that I found yet to do that. Only options for turning off sounds and timer. So anyone know how it's done? Now the good things. I don't like to use shuffle. I prefer to try again. The game will automatically shuffle when no more moves (wished it wouldn't and let the player decide if wants to shuffle, undo, or restart ,(replay). Basically I finish the game when they shuffle it automatically and then replay. Lots of levels! Lots of layouts! Addicting and hard to say no to &#34;just on more level&#34; again and again. One of the best mahjong! Would love if this version was available for PC too. Oh and like most games asks over and over if you want to leave a review. I did for the demo so here's hoping it don't pop up again. An option to say &#34;review done&#34; or whatever and it not ask again.
B003UYUP6M|3.0|Google and Apple have captured the imagination of the masses. Ironically, often when a company is heralded for its incredible practices it can be precursor to its downfall (think of “In Search of Excellence” and “Good to Great”). I also wonder how much is propaganda. Having visited Google in Palo Alto and their substantial New York City location, I would say they enjoy “an atmosphere of the possible”. However, it’s unbelievable growth will challenge it’s ability to protect and nurture what made it great in the first place: innovation mind-set, speed, openness, experimentation, and risk taking. Author Levy keeps a nice balance and is not entirely sucked into all things Google. From my perspective, the moment Google changes its policy on giving employees one day a week to work on anything they want will be the first step in a path to irrelevance.

0300169787|4.0|Alexander McQueen’s incredible influence can be attributed to smashing convention and challenging people to rethink the status quo. He took fashion out of its own realm by expressing ideas through his design. His work confronted race, class, sexuality, religion, and the environment. The book coincided with the wildly successful exhibition at The Metropolitan Museum of Art (my daughter and I tried getting in to no avail given the crowds). McQueen was a technical innovator who knew how to employ theater and extravagance to deliver incredible runway presentations that showed his works of art in the superb creative context.

B004J4XGN6|4.0|Starting a business is an uncertain outing and this is where Ries’ book nails it. Entrepreneurs have always possessed a higher risk tolerance than most and we need these folks more than ever to drive employment. However, anyone in business can benefit from thinking like a startup by innovating within their own jobs and given it is a mindset it can also be applied to non-profits, NGOs, public sector, and volunteer organizations. Ries advocates not getting bogged down in excessive planning instead focusing on adjusting as one goes – ‘action now’ is its rallying cry.

B004R1Q2EG|5.0|Commonly accepted research shows that people buy both on rational and emotional considerations. As a marketer, it is a challenge to brand a product solely on rational aspects. People bond with brands and establish commercial relationships like they do with peers and lovers – the most successful of these are described in emotional terms. Noble Prize winner Kahneman describes two systems that are at play simultaneously in our minds. “System 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional; System 2 is slower, more deliberative, and more logical.” This is the must read book for corporate and brand strategists. Underlying the author’s work is how certain constructs in our society bias us even before we cognitively balance the two systems.

B005T4SW7K|4.0|A confession: I love history so may have been unduly influenced with this choice. Yet, it holds amazing business lessons specifically how the best innovations served real needs. From the Olduvai Handaxe to the Early Writing Tablet to Korean Roof Tile to the Ming Banknote right up to the modern Credit Card, these incredible stories from our history offer practical instruction. Let me put this way – wouldn’t you like to know the answers to the following to amaze and amuse your colleagues … When were cows domesticated and why do we feed their milk to our children? Where were the first cities and what made them succeed? Who invented math-or came up with money? All kidding aside, the book reveals “who we are by looking at what we have made”.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I absolutely adore this game. The only thing I have trouble with is sometimes when it loads it freezes my whole Kindle Fire up and I have to restart the whole tablet. But other than that this game is amazing.
0374532990|5.0|This is a story of reinvention and reclamation told by the two New Yorkers who had the idea to transform a derelict elevated railway into something all could enjoy. Their tenaciousness and dedication are inspirational and admirable. It is even more amazing given they had no experience in urban planning. The process they employed involving the various stakeholders provides numerous lessons for all us striving to advance projects and start businesses. High Line is incredibly illustrated but cannot replace the actual experience of walking this creatively transformed West Side asset.

1938469003|5.0|I'm really enjoying this. The historical chapters are very readable and the recipes are helpful if you know how to use them (which other reviewers apparently didn't). To calculate the hopping rates, you take the IBUs given in the analytical targets, then use the percentages given in the hopping section to calculate how many IBUs you need from each addition for each hop. Then you use for system's hop utilisation rate at that addition point, the brewlength, and the alpha acid content of the hop variety to turn the IBU figure into a number of grams. E.g. if you know you need 87 IBUs, and your brew length is 20 litres, and the recipe tells you to use 17.7% alpha acid CTZ at the start of the boil, to provide 23.3% of the IBUs and your system has a 35% utilisation rate at the start of the boil, then you want 87 * 0.233 = 20.271 IBUs from your addition 1 IBU = 1 mg/l alpha acid, so you need 20.271 * 20 = 405.42mg alpha acid for a brew length of 20 litres, which given utilisation is 405.42 / 0.35 = 1158.34mg. And CTZ has 17.7% alpha so that requires 1158.34 / .177 = 6544.3mg, or roughly 6.5g. Similarly, the malt bill is stated as percentages rather than in terms of weight to allow brewers to adapt them to different brewlengths as required. One criticism I would make at this point is that it is not explicitly stated whether the malt percentages refer to malt mass or percentage of the extract. Does 90% pale malt mean 90% of the mass of malt used is pale malt, or does it mean 90% of the extract making up the wort comes from pale malt. Different malts supply extract at different rates, so, for example, if 10% of your extract had to come from crystal malt, the mass of crystal malt would be more than 10% of the total malt mass. Here's how I would calculate how much to use for a beer that was supposed to be 94.3% pale and 5.7% chocolate malt with an original specific gravity of 1.070 for a brewlength of 20 litres. 1.070 is 70 'brewers points' 70*20 is 1400 brewers points altogether. You need to know your mash efficiency. Suppose it is 75%. So you need to add 1400 / 0.75 = 1866.67 brewers points to the mash tun. 94.3% of those come from pale malt = 1760.26. And from the malt specification sheet for the pale malt it should tell you the extract yield in litre degrees per kilo, say 301 'as is', so that is 1760.26 / 301 = 5.85kg pale malt. If the chocolate malt makes up 5.7% of the extract and has an ldk of 265 'as is' you need 1866.67 * 0.057 = 106.4, 106.4 / 265 = 0.4kg. So going by extract, you need 5.8 kg pale and 0.4kg chocolate (in terms of mass these would be 93.6% and 6.4%, note the difference).

B00F3W9NQ2|3.0|It's really not much more than just a bunch of giggly girls loosely based around going to high school and freshman college.  Really not to well thought out.  They play too much music too loud to enjoy the show.  I guess they use a lot of &#34;musical' background noise to make up for not much of  a storyline.  The could get rid of Elena any time now and get the show moving.  The spinoff &#34;The Originals&#34; is much better.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|I guess what they revealed isn't really news, but sometimes we need to be reminded and actually see these things (and the unpleasant details).  I will never buy or knowingly eat any chicken from Foster Farms or any meat from any of the other places that I recall from this documentary.  I am not, nor will become a vegetarian, but I'd prefer to eat animals that lived normal, happy lives in natural surroundings, were treated with kindness and dignity, and ate normal food.<br /><br />The other thing about the documentary was seeing people working horrible, soul-killing (not to mention often dangerous) jobs, being mistreated as much as the animals, and other people having to scrabble for work and having to work very long hours at low paying jobs so they have neither the time nor money to fix and eat even mildly healthy food.  Their bodies are giving up the battle to stay functional and vital by their 40s, and I wonder how they will live in the next 10 years with no health and no resources or safety net.  I have no leanings towards a socialist society, but this situation is very wrong and I don't know the solution.  I know one thing:  I will never complain about my well paying, normal work hours job with benefits ever again.  I don't like going to work as I have lost interest in what I do and find it boring, but I needed this reminder to realize how really, really good I have it, and stop taking what I have for granted.  Hopefully I will be nicer to others and give a bit more to charities in hopes of evening out things.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This was a quick and entertaining read. I enjoyed the movie, but Katniss was so much more complicated and real in the book and if possible, the Capitol even more shallow and frightening. Very Big Brother.....and with the current deluge of reality television and the state of the world around us it is too easy to imagine people actually finding this type of show normal and an acceptable form of entertainment some day. Shudder...
B00BEF1AEK|4.0|This game is so weirdly entertaining... I can't even imagine what was going on in the developer's mind that would make them think of a stone ball with a face, a crown, and an absurdly long and prehensile (sort of) purple tongue. It's beyond bizarre...but very engaging. Yes, it stems from the now-popular physics-based principle of directing a projectile object at a target object in a game format. But this jamoke does it with his TONGUE. All the while, just hanging around in the sky, swinging it back and forth with a rock attached to it. WEIRD!! But somehow cool... and you can't stop, which kind of makes YOU weird, but somehow cool... or not... who cares, it's fun. : )  If you are a fan of the judge-measure-arc-propulsion-velocity-distance principles found in 'Angry Birds' and 'Siege Hero', pick this one up. I do think you'll enjoy it. I got mine on Amazon's Free App Of The Day... might not be a $2.99 purchase you are willing to make, that may be a bit high for many. But again, if you like this game genre, it might be well worth it for you.

B00F2HW20M|5.0|I have been a Genesis fan since their first live album was released in 1973. Unlike many fellow progressive era fans, I don't refer to that era as the Peter Gabriel years. I refer to those years as the Steve Hackett years. Yes, he was only with them for six years, six studio albums, and two live albums, but what an impact he had on their music!  Once he left the band, the sound gradually grew away from the complexities from those 1971 to 1976 years. Also notice that when Peter left, that magical Hackett sound continued for two more albums.<br /><br />I also had the good fortune of having first seen Genesis on The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway tour, which that album was performed in it's entirety with The Musical Box as an encore. One NEVER forgets such things like this! Fellow fans always asked me what it was like. Well, most of the crowd became pre-occupied with &#34;I wonder what Peter is going to wear next&#34; as the best music of the whole show was played as mostly instrumentals. These interludes were actually designed into the album to give Peter a chance to change costumes in the live show. I went against the grain and really could have cared less what Peter was going to wear next, because it did distract from the actual playing on stage, despite magnifying the lyrical meaning. I still remember the circular Lamia curtain lit by blacklight as if it was yesterday. Peter stood in the middle and turned it around as glowing &#34;three vermillion snakes&#34; circled around him in time to the bass pedal. And who could forget the bald old man costume doing his final very violent act in The Musical Box? That one still gives me the chills, but it is thankfully toned down very much in this DVD.<br /><br />So, as I watched this breath taking DVD, I could not help but bring back memories of that show back in 1974. You know, I actually like this better because there is no distraction from costume changes. Vocalist Nad Sylvan does a fine job recreating much of Peter's vocals and mannerisms, along with help from drummer Gary O'Toole. Yes, I do miss the raspiness and vocal range that Peter had back then, but watching this current lineup had me so excited that I could only wonder if they will get together to write new material. This band is THAT good playing together! However, I seriously doubt that men of their age will find similar lyrical inspiration from the early seventies.. Those times are gone for good and most of us have actually grown up.<br /><br />Being that this one was released just in time for Christmas, it would make a great gift to every aging progressive rock fan, as well as Genesis fans who are adventurous and would like to see what all the fuss was about before Phil took over on vocals. By the way, on that 1974 tour, Peter's character Rael often bullied poor Phil onstage and I never once dreamed that Phil would ever become the leader of the band. Mike Rutherford also hated those years because they were starving due to a very limited audience for this brainy music. Tony just kept moving along with the flow through the years.<br /><br />I do hope that Phil, Mike, and Tony give Steve their blessings to write new material with this band. This set just makes us want more!nd mannerisms, along with help from drummer Gary O'Toole.

B00A8FXT8M|5.0|This might just be the best book I ever read. And i've read lots of books. It's sad, depressing, disturbing, though-provoking, hopeful, easy-to-read, emotive, and it moved me deeply. seriously brilliant. I really cant understand why it's not in every top ten of great books of all time. Amazing
B00GX59QO2|2.0|What a poor follow-up to a unique and fun movie.  This &#34;sequel&#34; is so cliche ridden, that I felt cheated out of part of my life after watching it.  For instance, just keep an eye on how many wardrobes are obtained almost instantaneously by the heroine.  Totally predictable and without an ounce of originality, you can safely skip this one and thank me at a later date for the warning.  The ONLY reason I gave this movie 2 stars was for the irrepressible John Malkovich.  The man makes the most of every opportunity to be funny and innovative - even when stopped by the script.
0141345659|4.0|Good story, but very sad.  I liked the way the kids in this story accepted their illnesses and didn't make that who they were.  They just wanted to be like other teen-agers.  Their joys were felt by me, as well as their heartbreaks.

B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Really high-quality cable! I needed to have a spare Kindle charger in my bedroom so I splurged on a $10 USB cable.  I won't lie, it hurt.  It felt like a total rip-off.  However, the quality is outstanding!  I've gone through dozens of the cheapies, they're always flimsy & the plastic coating splits at the connectors exposing the wires.  I know this cable is going to last a long time!
B00BATG18K|4.0|Amy Tan's writing is so gorgeous - it is a pleasure to read, like sinking into a warm, fragrant bath.  Of course, there is also the expectation that if anything can go wrong, it will....so best not to get too comfortable in that tub.  At several points, I found myself groaning internally and wishing I could say to one character or another, 'No, don't do that/don't go there/don't say that/don't trust him or her!'  So, one star is missing from my rating, representing my eventual frustration with the inevitability of worst case scenarios - one minute too late here, missed connection there.  Granted, every incident was totally plausible and contributed to the momentum of the story, but it was worth the star to me.<br />On the other hand, the four filled in stars are for an engaging and haunting trip through the world of courtesans in early 1900s Shanghai, vividly portrayed with beauty and grit by Ms Tan.  My thought is that we haven't heard the last of Flora, Violet or Lucia.....I hope!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I couldn't understand the hype before about this game but now I see why it's so popular.  I've been playing for about a week and am already on level 34....like I said addictive. Now I'm in competition with my boyfriend. Get the game!
B00CFOGCAG|1.0|Was rejected by my antivirus as dangerous and now I can't get rid of the picture of the fist off my Android.
B008MVPCLG|5.0|A great shoe.<br />Light and moldable.<br />Color is bright and fun, great for summer.<br />Great quality highly recommended.<br />I will buy again.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|A must read<br />In the true John Grisham tradition this is a book that keeps your interest and does not get lost in itself.
B00C70FH7M|5.0|Progressive Music has gotten out of control. Even Some of the old masters use death Metal Growls. But These guys are like a well oiled machine. Sharp and Precise in their execution. Vocals go well with the music without over powering it. It's their versatility that makes them so good from mellow jazz like passages to straight up Fusion. Fantastic musicians they really know how play their instruments well. The layers are fantastic.
B00AEUPOVQ|3.0|Problem was the actors. The story was good, but the male lead was not believable in the role to me..
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Cute game, like its predecessor a lot hoops to go g h rough to get w g ere you r e going
B0091VYG86|5.0|Interesting movie.  Not everything is black and white.  There are a few hidden messages in this movie.<br />I can watch this movie over and over again and not get bored.  I have the DVD.  I think the HD version (blu-ray) would be even better.  If you have Amazon Prime and have not seen this movie, be sure to do so.  You will not regret it.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|It's very effective and cheap.  Great for cast Youtube and Netflix in our TV. It would be better if I could use it to cast my photos and video in my computer.  Maybe for next version
B0087GF8ZG|3.0|I bought two of these and use them outside.  One works perfectly.  The other either doesn't come on, or comes on and stays on.  The one that stays on does work in the house, so maybe it doesn't like the cold.  This is a hit-or-miss light.  Great if you get a good one, disappointing if you get a bad one.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Adele became an overnight success and for good reasons. Her voice is crystal clear and her range is amazing. I love this CD!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This is much more than a book about a dog.  This is a book about life.  I highly recommend this to anyone who has ever owned a dog.
B003KRJNBW|5.0|One of my family's favorite movies of all times. Wasn't sure we would even like it -- turned out to be great!  Good all the way thru - excellent ending.
0553582011|5.0|It arrived in a timely manner. This is a great book series, I have enjoyed the first three books. I look forward to reading this one.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|Love this app. Easy to use. Have it on all my wireless devices! My husband and daughter uses it on their devices too!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Just what I was expecting for my Android. Was worried that I couldn't get it set up on my Android but It's on there now. Easy to use and It has my books on it that is also on my PC.
006202406X|2.0|Typical 3rd book in a series... Not even close to as good as the 2nd which was not nearly as good as the first. This book was confusing & hard to follow - there was absolutely no voice throughout the book.  If I didn't read the title of each chapter, I would never know if it was from Tris or Tobias' point of view.  Quite disappointing given her popularity ; would hate for young readers to think this is how to show voice when writing.  Explanation of the Edith Prior video was weak. Lots of foreshadowing regarding Tris' fate.
B0028RXXFC|4.0|LOVE the series & waited sooo long for right price to buy it in complete season on blu-ray, till I got it now on blk Friday about $40...nice crisp pic & sound ..real rich, awesome cast, just  well done...ONLY thing I gave 4 stars DIDN'T like about the  series is the format part .. NOT widescreen  as 2.35  shot ..Such is a shame for such a BIG & RICH production value and  pic is not shot in widescreen format ...but this is the one to keep.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy crush is a wonderful game.  It let you go through so many emotions at one.  There might be a game where u r up set because you have no time and only one move left and the they joy comes when the game you are toiling over for weeks u finally madter it.  It is a challenging game.  I love it
0790734850|5.0|Terrific movie.  Terrific actors/actresses.  Moves right along.  This one is a winner on all counts.  Glamorous, engrossing, and won't disappoint.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I thought I was going to hate this game but I love it so much. Get this game you will not regret it at all
B00ALYY6ZA|4.0|I read the whole book.  I felt more confident starting this eating plan after I understood the science and reasoning behind it.  After one month on this diet I have lost 9 pounds and am very encouraged to continue.  I plan to lose 30 more pounds and expect to do so in the next three or four months.  I now understand that going without food for a span of hours is actually good for me and will help me to be more healthy.  I am quite excited about this plan as I found it to be relatively easy.  Two days a week on 500 calories and eating normally the other days of the week.  I find that I have changed my habits already.  I no longer feel that I must be snacking in the evening and I am mindful of what I am eating.  I don't go crazy on the normal eating days.  The only fault I have with the book is that the suggested meals for the fast days are so complicated.  When I am hungry, I just want to have something simple, low-glycemic and easy.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|ARE YOU A MINION LOVER LIKE THIS APP IS SIMILAR TO THE SUBWAY GAME I AM NOT SURE WHAT IT IS CALLED. THERE ARE ALWAYS NEW AND COOL UPDATES. I HAVE NOTHING BAD TO SAY ABOUT THIS APP.
B00G7QPTR0|5.0|I loved the HBO documentary. I can't wait to get the Revel concert as a bonus. Beyonce is simply the best.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|I'm try to install it but it says the same thing everytime its that Thor kindle fire can not download ar install youtube so I frickin bate it
B00ENYKBD0|5.0|This was a really good movie. Somehow we never saw it when it first came out and now we can't figure out how we missed it. Truly one of the best movies I've seen in a long while.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book belongs on my Best 10 Books Ever list. I just reread it and it's even better the second time around.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|This game is fun. It's not Castleville, but close enough to be familiar and yet have some surprises too. I'm enjoying learning the new quests. Thanks to Amazon for bringing g this out.<br /><br />However, the app tends to get a little testy. Not all the listed features are present, and I've had to delete and reload it multiple times.<br /><br />Alasbabylon
B00ENTDDGW|4.0|This game is a great, simple little thing that I really enjoy. Why not 5 stars, you ask? Well, sadly, it freezes my Fire 2 a fair amount, and the ads to buy the upgrade are distinctly annoying. Otherwise, it would get 5 stars from me!
B003VANOFY|4.0|I love this headset. I would buy it again if I could. Perfect in every aspect but it could be lighter. It works for me as noise cancelling and it sounds amazing! great buy!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|So much fun!! Amazing graphics and easy to play. Also, pretty easy to advance through the game without spending any money.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Only Netflix and Youtube by now but seems promise. Using the PC or smartphone as the &#34;control remote&#34; was a great idea of Google. I have a Roku in other TV and by now Roku is much better.<br /><br />One of the good things is that you can cast your Chrome tab or even the computer screen. There's some lag doing that but gives you more options to cast content from PC to TV
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|A different perspective of Jesus, the human and how turbulent the times were during his time on earth. This book does not challenge my belief but it does help me to visualize what it was like to walk beside him in his travels.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Very fun and challenging. Although, it would be better if you could buy weapons without having to have internet connection
B008K6HN8I|5.0|App is useful on finding your downloaded side apps or misc downloads on the Kindle Fire.  Only way I could locate my downloads.  If there is a way on the Fire operating system I don't know how but this makes it very easy.
B00EQ0CKRQ|4.0|Good graphics and the cars were very cool and easy to drive.  Most car games are not very good. Thanks
B003O86FMW|3.0|50% of this book built to what happen and the rest predictably brought that satisfying end. it's only a must read for the trilogy otherwise skip this book.
B005PK56TA|5.0|I loved it. Was somewhat twisted but kept my mind racing. Being on the edge of my seat is what I want
B002MFWLXK|5.0|Watching it for the second time on the 50th anniversary of the assassination of JFK.  First time, saw it in a movie theater back in 1991.  Now with this purchase, I have my own copy to review it again and again.  So much information presented so quickly in the film that you don't catch or understand all of it the first or even second viewing.  Helps to check with other sources available on the internet to more fully understand the film.  When the film first came out, there was no internet.  You get more out of the film if you research online the characters in the film before or after watching the film. Still digesting it after several viewings.  It's been 50 years and you would think everything would be available to the public by now.  However, many government documents still have not been released according to news stories online and will not be released until 2017.  Why?  Also, struck by remarkable physical resemblance between actor Tommy Lee Jones and Clay Shaw whom he portrays in JFK. Clay Shaw's photo on internet today.  Shaw's photo not so readily available in '91.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Oh my goodness this game is addictive and disruptive to every day life. Caution do not get this game unless you have lots of free time.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It's been 15yrs since I have read a book. Due to not staying intrigued by them. I finished this book in three days. My desire to know what happened after the last movie paid off! A++++
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is really good it's both challenging and fun I love it I play it every day pretty much you'll love it. Good price too. :)
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Practically not a fan of these genre, but I like the first book of this trilogy. And it's a such a good deal, so I recommend it to anyone who wants to read this for once :)
B0054S6N04|5.0|This is my third time reading this book an  it gets better each time. Jaine and Sam are my favorite couple. Every woman should have a Sam looking out for  them. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone. It's fast paced, suspenseful, full of laughs and tears, and the romance is scorching.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|you should get this game I refer this game over temple run any day you should get this game it is so great
B002UD56I6|4.0|Great human being! Great! Stunning recording! Much fun with music! Enjoyable documentary. Very impressive artists and best of all: Michael Jackson!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is fun and challenging.  I recommend this game. It involves many layers of thought. Good for all age<br />s....9-89.
B002LC8HF0|5.0|Who needs  sleep when you can be reading this book? I don't think I have been so happy  and sad to see a book end. It's full of magic, love, adventure and so much more. The magic system that  he has is extensive and new! He makes you love the characters. You truly want to see  them succeed. I couldn't get enough. I can not wait to read more from Brandon Sanderson.
B0078XFYDA|5.0|Well written, informative, a good refresher on science. Covers a wide range of topics with humor and insight. Entertaining. Recommended.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great little ad. It is there for the simple day to day calculations and it does its work with very little fanfare. Love that the display is clear and large. Ads are unobtrusive and best of all it is free.
B00FJMAGQM|5.0|This is Freshest hits album ever!!! What Laura did hear is redo (or remaster or do live) all the songs perviously released. Some are duets such as Non C'e with Marc Anthony., some with full orchestrations such as La Solatudane with Enrico Marricone which is just fantastic. Some are slowed down or done in a different way. Its all very well done. Along with a few new recordings for Laura Its like getting a new CD, really two there are a few versions of this out, the minimum number of tracks is 20 there are 39 tracks on the deluxe editions. Also the above version 20  is geared to the  to Italian and English speaking Markets. (the version with 20 Grandes Exitos is greed to the Spanish speaking market) So pick the version you want, I would surest you get the deluxe of either through, its wonderful and the extra tracks are great. Pausini is a wonderful singer she has a seductive and great voice and can interpret a song in many ways.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I love it<br />So much fun to play. I don't like having to return to the same areas so many times.
B0068THAGY|4.0|A ' Goonies' for a new generation. Scary without being too gory. A touching tribute to grieving families and the magic of filmmaking.
B006LSZECO|4.0|It was a good book - fast read, but a bit predictable. I can't say much more without giving away the book, but it's hard to love a book whose characters you don't particularly like (I am sure this was by choice).
B00499NHLC|5.0|I had nearly given up on finding something worth watching. Excellent program. Well written and acted. BBC does great TV. Love it!
B005HSL626|2.0|I thought this was the game--it is a &#34;book&#34; on my kindle.  I can't get the game on my Kindle for some reason.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|I have been playing this on my computer for several years and was very excited when it became available for my phone and tablet. Thank you for a great game. I love it so much I have all three versions.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|As all of the film dialog was sung, the Soundtrack includes the entire film It  was Described as highlights, But I am enjoying all of the film soundtrack.
B00AB7HESI|3.0|This game is fun but you don't get much of a game to play. you can only go so far before you have to purchase more to keep playing it. Not worth it.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I love it do not even explain how much like this game. This is one of the best games I have ever played. All the levels are able to be achieved with out pay.
B00BATG18K|5.0|I love all of her books. She is my favorite author. Wonderful characters. Excellent book.  Could not put the book down.
B00ADQCBEY|4.0|I would love the show but for the poor streaming quality of Amazon.  Every episode freezes and it's hard to watch.  Not sure why it is this way on this particular series but it continues on into Season 2...bummer.
B004ZNB12O|4.0|A good party album with a few interesting choices makes this better than the typical &#34;best of&#34; discs. Makes a good road album, you will cover 100 miles by the time its played out. Not for Floydheads, they already own this music.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Playing this game is stops any and all of your duties.  It will capture your attention and when you know it the day is gone.  I have enjoyed all of Zynga game.  It can be a little expensive.  One of the things I dislike is your storage is to small.  The ship takes to long to come in. Fix that and I may never go to sleep.
B003G4W49C|3.0|I read this because I found it on sale and I felt obligated, knowing it was one of those seminal books to a lot of my friends' childhood.<br /><br />I'm reading it as an adult, with a lot of reading behind me that YA readers don't have. So I'm sure that I see things that I wouldn't have if I read it as a kid. I can see, if I had read it then, it probably would have filled a similar place to the one that &#34;Dragonsinger&#34; (Anne McCaffrey) filled for me at that time. A near perfect kid (or set of kids), beaten down by plan or circumstance, overcoming it all. A well worn, though commonly used trope.<br /><br />As an adult I had a hard time seeing more than a Heinlein style government made desperate, then abusing a kid for the length of a book.  Sure you can argue that it was necessary, but I found hte combination to be wearing. Superkids with an authoritarian abusive system they turn out to be smarter than, mostly.<br /><br />And a twist at the end.<br /><br />None of this is to say it's a *bad* book, after all I'm comparing it to one of my very favorite YA books (despite that book's flaws). I just couldn't see it being the life changing book it clearly has been for some of my friends.
B0084BMUFA|3.0|The movie was better. I really loved the Disney movie, but the book was boring. It didn't appeal to me at all.
B00AQA94M4|5.0|TRUE mastery in every sense, just how he and his sidekick, the great SASHA PAETH keep up this level of musical mastery is beyond belief, and he and SASHA seem to bring out the BEST in everyone who plays with them, production, is as always faultless and pristine, this is how this genre is MEANT to sound, now if only he'd bring this stuff out to the West Coast..how about it guys, until then, just keep up the great work, another masterclass from TOBIAS and SASHA.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved it, couldn't put it down.  On my recommendation, my sister and husband read it and loved it.  Excellent plotting and character development, fascinating themes.  I cannot wait to see the movie.
B00G5G7EXY|3.0|We went to watch this last night on opening night because my daughter has seen the advertisements for weeks. Her favorite part is Olaf especially when he sneezes and his head falls off. Imagine our surprise when that is NOT in the movie. Matter of fact quite a few scenes from the commercials/teasers are not in the movie. The movie wasn't bad but completely misrepresented. It made it seem it was more of the snowman and reindeer but it's not. They have small roles. It is a Disney &#34;princess&#34; movie and a musical. Also like many of the older Disney movies it involves death for the parents. (I feel that should be known for any sensitive children before you go.) Overall my kids liked it although they both noticed the funny parts from the commercials weren't there. They both did immediately want to buy it on DVD but I am hesitant. I had higher hopes.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|grandson played but i didn't cars for it. i wen t looking for another game to play with his and then stopped looking
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|A very good read. Felt connected to the characters and enjoyed all the twists and turns as the story unfolded.interesting perspective on life and how things happen for a reason even when there's so much going on behind the scenes that we don't have control over
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Love the show, was great to be able to download to tv to watch, since not on netflix yet, ready to watch the dvr-ed season 3 this happy holiday weekend!!
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Honestly a great game to play. Can get very addicting, so don't say I didn't warn you!! Lol<br />Definitely a fun game, and its free, too! Everyone should get this game. I'm using a Kindle HD Fire so that might also have to do a lot with the quality of the game.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved it and the movie is just as amazing. Recommended  to anyone who is as amazing as this book
B008IJHIAA|5.0|they were better live than on record during these years.CD2 is a concert recording<br />that proves the band was burning for it.the passion is endless.<br />all the songs are better here than on record.<br />these days,welcome to the occupation,begin the begin,already in 1987 they had<br />a catalog of songs that beats most acts today(coldplay?).<br />this is punkish,fast rock n roll.<br />if you only like MOR type REM songs this is NOT for you.<br />everybody hurts but sometimes we rock too.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This was the ending and conclusion that fitted the shinning. To see what happens to the people all these years later was amazing.
B00BEIYMIS|5.0|Very good movie! The fact that this movie was based supposedly on an actual event makes this very frightening indeed. The plot is very good and the paranormal investigators (husband and wife) were very convincing. The haunted house genre has been played out again and again, but this movie intensifies that aspect of horror films. This movie is more about demonic possession than about house hauntings, but both are interwoven together superbly! This movie is not for the feint of mind. The movie has an excellent ending also! Definitely worth the money!
B00BMKH5NW|3.0|First, I really and sincerely enjoyed this author's writing style. It is witty, funny, unique and light-hearted (...am looking forward to reading more of her stuff). The book was an easy, up-beat read. I loved all her references to movies and books. She also does a very good and realistic stream of consciousness for her characters- what Cath is doing vs. what she is thinking. Especially in her make-out scene.<br />She also makes her characters and their experiences very relatable... Seriously, about Cath's relationship with Abel- I had a boyfriend who actually did gift me a computer charger for my birthday, so reading Wren and Cath talking about it was like reading my conversations with my friends.<br /><br />I liked the book's premise, as well as the main character set-up: the geeky, shy, unwitting, D&D type of girl!  I absolutely adored Reagan, and would, very much, LOVE to have a book written from her POV.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I had to take away stars for two reason:<br /><br />(1) At some point in the book Cath became slightly annoying, whiny and stuck. I was hoping Cath would develop some back bone, but she allows herself to be treated as a doormat though out the story and at no point does she stand-up for herself. She hates what Nick did but when offered credit and for her work, she refuses-not on moral or pride but because she is still having a pity party over what he did and can't bear to look or talk to him. Also, at no point does Cath let her sister know how she made her feel.  Finally, she is given the support and respect of a teacher and she whines about it, instead of taking full advantage of that opportunity... something about that made her seem pathetic and ungrateful.<br /><br />(2)The fan fiction sections of the book were a little cliche- a type of marriage between Harry Potter and Twilight. While I enjoyed the small excerpts from her favorite book and from her fanfic, and how they related to that specific moment in her life- I thought that, attimes, the author dedicated too much \\"space\\" to the fanfic narration. It is hard to relate to this because we haven't actually read the books she is talking about. I think she did it as a way to give us insight into Cath's writing ability... but I would have much rather have some of that time dedicated to reading more of her short story. I think being able to read a greater length of her story would have given us greater insight into her journey and where she's headed. Maybe, rounded out the story by showing character growth and closure (solving my issue with felling that Cath failed to bloom...). Perhaps, the author can release the story as an extra? HINT, HINT!! ;)
B008ALA6DW|5.0|Works really well connecting my new Macbook Pro to the internet via gigabit ethernet!  I do think when a customer pays that much for a laptop, it should come with this adapter.  That aside, this little device really delivers a zippy connection!
B00A1XOPE8|4.0|This book has a very unique magical system that is consistent, well implemented and is used to tell a very interesting story.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|This is one of the best films i've ever seen. I was watching one of the Sunday morning political shows and heard George Will say the same thing. Any American who has the slightest suspicion of their govenrment, especially in view of the infrastructure being built in tne Utah desert to  house the computer systems that will allow our own government to spy on the billions of Emails and phone calls of American citizens, need to watch this film. The film has a romantic subplot, the the real meat is in the survelliance systems used by the East German Stasi (Secret Police). The  producer even went to the trouble of tracking down a West German who's hobby it is to collect the real electronics used by the Stasi. Everything is authentic ... the streets, the electronics and even the colors used in the film. Its art. Its history. Its mankiind at his worst, and at his best. This is a film that I will be sharing with evey friend who shows interest in watching it. Its in German with English sub-titles. I don't ordinarly like sub-titled films, but this one is easy to read and follow. Highly recommended. Five stars!
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I have always been a SK fan, I really enjoyed this book. Not the usual horror stuff, reminds me of The Talisman.
B008BO61BE|5.0|Great concert by  a great group!<br />This a good mix of Judas Priest music- a very enjoyable concert experience for all
B0054JZC6E|5.0|awesome game i play this game all the time it past the time away i fully recommend this game.  you should get this game
B00BI6SSMC|3.0|Its good. Songs are a bit more &#34;pop&#34; than previous lps. Shepard Dog is still my fav and still recommend seeing him live
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much.<br />It would be nice to have more about their lives later in life.  Maybe a book 2.
B008OM7A6I|4.0|its good for what it is. everything else he has done on his own reminds me too much of iron and wine. i like iron and wine but i dont need another one of him and its not something i can always listen too. really cool packaging though.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Aslan reviews the evidence without judgement, and presents a portrait of the historical Jesus which is both compelling and interesting.
B00BQ1DATU|4.0|great album. great songs. great voice. everything jose does is good.  the first cd  came damaged...prob from manufactor. amazon exchange policy was top notch. recieved a new one in no time and it still plays great
B004T4KQJS|4.0|Krauss has a wonderful gift for making complicated subjects understandable. But then he uses his platform to publicly argue and sneer at fundamentalist theists who don't want to learn. The book would have been better to end with the sense of wonder that it created in the reader, instead of schoolyard taunting.
B000000OF6|5.0|Great Album, most of the great songs that I expected.  Good quality recordings.  I would purchase this item again.  Awesome.
B000065V3H|5.0|As a child, I remember watching this movie. One evening as I was watching a particular t.v. show, I remembered how much I enjoyed this movie. I ran over and purchased it here. I have since watched it several times and it still entertains me. The plot is linear but all the actors do a good job.<br />Eighties and Ninties movie lovers will enjoy this film.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|I love it because I get to watch movies and tv shows any time I want . i love this app very much.
B000002AVF|5.0|This is one of my favorite Mariah albums, but I lost my original purchase when I moved. I bought it again and I love every song on the album.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book is very well thought out, I couldn't seem to let myself stop reading it sometimes. I am actually writing this review at 3 A.M. because once I hit about 70% completion I had to finish it up. I am definitely starting the 2nd book ASAP..
B00EVW0SA0|5.0|This movie was very exciting and had a great story. The choice of actors for each part was spot on.
0199573204|5.0|First time reader? Prepare for enlightenment!<br />Here is the ultimate classic, in every best sense of the word. Of all the books on all those &#34;Read this Book&#34; lists, this one will surely outlive all the others.<br />Conditions, situations, circumstances and prospects change, but for better and worse, we human beings do not. This direct, honest book is packed with timeless sage advice for every man and woman in every age and time.<br />If I was confined to five books--it would have to be at gunpoint to do it--this slim, straightforward little book will certainly be first. Hundreds of years of great thinkers and great writers have not done more or finer work than Marcus Aurelius.<br />There may be a discussion necessary about favorite individual editions, but this is certainly required reading for every working mind.
B00A285OOW|5.0|This is one of Philippa Gregory's best books I have read and one of the best in the genre. I couldn't leave it until I reached the last page. It is a real treat.

B005T87QCI|3.0|What I don't like is when your on survival and you defeat a robot it doesn't restore your life. That's what I don't like. But the game itself is one of the best games I've played on this app store!
B000000OTU|5.0|This is a really good compilation if you want the best hits from 3 of the best albums from the legendary AEROSMITH....I really like PUMP, PERMANENT VACATION and GET A GRIP....There´s many HUGE HITS like RAG DOLL, ANGEL, LIVIN ON THE EDGE, CRAZY, WHAT IT TAKES and LOVE IN A ELEVATOR,,,,,I miss 1 or 2 songs like MAGIC TOUCH and ST JOHN, and i really don´t know why 2 versions of DUDE LOOKS LIKE A LADY and WHY totally forget the great album DONE WITH MIRRORS, but if you want the basic HITS this is a great compilation....A, the 2 new songs( BLIND MAN and WALK ON WATER ) are pretty cool!!!!!

6304698623|5.0|Love it gor for it.  It was amazing the quality and also love the fact it came in 3 diferent lenguages and the same with the subtitles. And the movie is amazing, magica, spiritual and touching.  So humanitarian.
B0091LS07E|5.0|Just love Alicia Keys.  So talented and beautiful but mostly, she exhibits a kind and generous spirit.  I'm and &#34;oldie but goodie&#34; and the music and lyrics, straight from her heart, inspire me, even at my age.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|Getting lost in the world that Donna Tartt creates in The Goldfinch is a great gift.  It engages the heart and mind in page after page of poetic writing and transports you. Magnificent.
1401922732|5.0|i have several card decks, but this one is the most beautiful i have ever seen.  the cards are all knockouts!  especially if you are a follower of Michael.  outstanding artwork by several artists.  just love this deck.
B0093H8H8I|5.0|I have this passively cooled in a HTPC. the HD3000 IGP can do Lancoz low settings in MadVR without problems.<br />PERFECT.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|My favorite part was when Auggie got a standing ovation. My least favorite part was when the dog, Daisy died. This book may be my favorite book ever!  (Note: review by son of big daddy)
B003VWU2WA|3.0|Great looking device but Griffin does not have and will not update their drivers.<br />The device need to be unplugged and plugged back in when the system comes back from sleep. Ugh, wish I didn't buy it but when it works, it is a very convenient volume knob.
B009K6DKTS|5.0|It's always exciting to see things turned on their head. It takes courage and tempered wisdom, but what if we went looking for that which we fear most to give us the best outcomes personally professionally and organisationally? Failure required. Learning from failure essential. Only by reversing our thinking are we able to move from simple resilience to anti-fragility
B00873GRU4|3.0|Sometimes too much repeated detail about the silo rather than getting on with the story. Otherwise, i cant wait to read the next book.
B00CH3DBNQ|3.0|I was expecting more by having less writing. clearly not written by Malala unless she is incredibly intelligent (child prodigy?) in addition to being a very brave girl. enjoyed it but would have preferred something simpler without so much history of Pakistan
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|I love this game it is kind of easy so you don't get frustrated.I do not like that it has not much energy
B005H9B2CE|5.0|I remember when this film came out in the theater I couldn't get anyone to watch it with me. Half of them thought it looked stupid and the other half thought it would be some mystical/magical thing and that really turned them off. But the reviews were positive and something...made me want to give it a chance.<br /><br />After seeing this film I was not just pleasantly surprised, I was genuinely amazing by how much better it was than it could have been. Whenever you get into a story that blurs the lines of the real world and a fantasy world, you are treading on dangerous ground. On the one hand if it's too realistic it comes across as odd, cheesy, and boring. If you go to far on the fantasy side it starts to feel like a cartoon with no dramatic real-world weight. But this film manages to walk the line, and walk it well.<br /><br />Critics can laugh and poke fun at the worlds of Thor all they want, but in the end, they are believable within the universe the film creates, and have depth beyond the spectacular battles and scenery-chewing of it's characters. And this springs from a genuinely heartfelt simple story of a fish-out-of-water who grows up.<br /><br />At the start of the film, it is quickly established that Thor is a good-hearted, hard-fighting, handsome, and shallow being who only wants glory and is quick to lose his temper. After making a series of horribly selfish errors in judgement, he is banished to Midgard, the realm of humans, where he meets a team of scientists and hilarity ensues. There is no plot in the human world, only gentle character-building as Thor interacts with others, and slowly loses his arrogance through coming to build real relationships with ordinary people.<br /><br />His mischief-causing brother is naturally up-to-no-good at the same time, and Thor has to grow as a person in time to save-the-day back home. What makes this extraordinary is the incredible sincerity that is brought to the character of Thor. When his transformation is complete, and he truly becomes WORTHY to wield the power he was born to, it is a great moment in comic book films indeed.<br /><br />All of this is aided by better-than-usual special effects (the other realms are so pretty your irises want to weep), great music, and witty, well-written dialog combined with good-natured humor.<br /><br />In the end, this film was handled just about perfectly. The only small downside I can see is that the Arizona sets look a bit low budget compared to everything else (not bad, just a little too made-for-TV). I highly recommend this film to anyone who is fan of comic books or comic book films, and even moreso to anyone anyone who is a sci-fi/fantasy fan and appreciates a well-made film.lete, and he truly becomes WORTHY to wield the power he was born to, it is a great moment in comic book films indeed.<br /><br />All of this is aided by better-than-usual special effects (the other realms are so pretty your irises want to weep), great music, and witty, well-written dialog combined with good-natured humor.<br /><br />In the end, this film was handled just about perfectly.

B003D81NVQ|5.0|One of those TV shows that gets you hooked and keeps you coming back for more. The content is pretty dark with moments of hilarity. Exceptional writing, direction, and cast. Well worth time and money to watch.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game because I have been waiting so long for this game to be available on Kindle fire ....so when I got this I had to read all the bad reviews just incase they happened to me ....and u know what they not true Because they may have problems with this game but i don't and I bet u won't either this is the best game and since I just got it ....I HONESTLY LOVE IT
1567184855|5.0|Fascinating testimonial evidence derived by hypnosis of thousands of subjects about their experience between lives. Just one more piece in the puzzle. For scientific evidence of reincarnation I recommend the works of the late researcher, Ian Stevenson, who cataloged hundreds of case studies that prove (as much as it can be) that reincarnation is both real and subject to scientific inquiry.
B00GO95TAC|1.0|im from the UK  and to all you guys in the states wondering why the price of  this item was suddenly hiked up. i may have the explanation .dr who is made by the BBC.llast monday the BBCs investigative programme called panorama did an under cover show about how workers in an amizon warehouse are heavily over worked and over a ten and hour shift walk up to around 11 miles.maybe amazon angry with the BBC are putting the price up to get their own back
B005ZUR724|5.0|At first it is confusing but after you get so far into it you start to figure stuff out most of the people are friendly and this is the first kindle game I have seen to use voice chat.
B0032KPE0G|1.0|sentimental maudlin tedium i wish it had been called five funerals. midde class england writtain for an american audience in mind
B007SGM084|4.0|although I tend to read PNR and UF books. i thought I would give it a try. I did find it predictable, and a little redundant. On the upside it did make me tear up, and laugh. I did feel that the story could have been extended and a lot more action could have been placed in it. but all in all it was interesting.
B00FG1Q5J8|1.0|Dont waste your cash on this.  Ok for a short bit then no where to advance. Just the same thing over and over. Very boring after a few days.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved this book very inspirational admit did cry when he died spoiler alert &#34;okay&#34; also just to say it &#34;always&#34;
B00365EVWE|5.0|you can,t beat sennheiser  products,I use these ear buds at the gym for the last  several months they are very durable,great sounding.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|It was very Great, but the only thing is that it needs to be able to move the person up and down, as in you being able to stand where you want and shot where you want. Other then that it was awesome.
B00003CXCT|5.0|What can I say except love love love.  The story, the extras.  And Star Wars nut it's a must have.  Perfect as a gift idea.
B003XE1DR4|5.0|I pretty much live in 'Crocs'. They are so light and comfy. This brand is wonderful as they can be worn at my work picking and packing fruit or when I out and about or around the house. They look good on as they are not 'bulky' looking like some and they are easy to wash and dry. I love my Crocs!
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Much better than some of the books he has written lately. John Grisham is such an excellent writer that perhaps I expect too much. I think that he cranks them out too fast in the last few years.
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|When I first saw this I wanted it so bad. When I started using it I was so confused about this app. DON'T GET THIS APP!
B00005N5S2|5.0|A great movie I could watch over and over!!  You can never get too much of the real thing!!!  This movie is an absolute must for the WWII collector!!  You will not be disappointed!
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|Ok I might have exaggerated a little bit but it is truly amazing I love it if you ask me it's worth 5$
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Candy Crush is a fun game, but they should take away the restriction on lives.  How many people actually buy lives when they run out of time?  Just let us keep on playing, and this game would be 100% better!
B003VIWO8Y|5.0|Good, well written book about Dave's life and the history of Megadeth.  Interesting look at early thrash metal beginning in the eighties and onward.
B008Y729FU|5.0|This is really a great movie, and when I watch it, I can't help but think about the star of the film, Brandon Lee and the tragic accident that happened while filming the movie. This movie is about love and loss and how fragile life is, how your life is affected by your choices and how those choices affect others in your life. I have the movie on Laserdisc, but, of course, the Amazon Prime 1080i streaming video blows my old LD version out of the water! Can't beat free for AP subscribers!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|As a 15 year cancer survivor, I have groped for words, descriptions and metaphors for living with cancer. This book provided them all.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I am so excited that.  Candy Crush Saga has finally made it to Kindle!  It is a frustratingly addictive game that adds a fun diversion to th day! I love it and am so glad to be able to play it on a larger screen!
B006M7JCC2|3.0|I love books about NDEs.  In fact, my favorite is, &#34;The Application of Impossible Things.&#34;  Check it out!  This book, while I enjoyed it, is repetitive and simplistic.  I would have liked more of the book to focus on the NDE, but she did a good job of explaining how she got in her life situation to set-up the situation. That's okay.  If Anita's experience is your first introduction to NDEs, it's a nice one.  I still enjoyed the comforting message and appreciated her experience of the Divine.  This book is approachable, accessible, and a nice introduction to the subject.
B009AY04A8|3.0|Nice graphics and story line. Some items are small and to well hidden. To much time spent on dialog. game ends with &#34;Stay tuned for the second part to be released later&#34;. not a complete game.  1st of 2 parts.
0763660531|5.0|My favorite kids' book of the year! Absolutely beautiful and imaginative. Give this to anyone on your Christmas list who loves art, imagination or is brave enough to embark on an adventure of the inner self. Each page has a lovely visual surprise. It's a wordless picture book that adults will enjoy just as much as kids. If you like magical realism, then this is going to be your new favorite, too!
B0064NTZJO|5.0|This movie is just badass... Every scene is great and packed with style. Nicolas Winding Refn went above and beyond with Drive. I've seen all of his movies, but this is easily his best work. This movie is not for everyone. Drive features you-gotta-see-it-to-believe-it violence and very little dialogue. However, I enjoyed every minute of it.<br /><br />The music from composer Cliff Martinez and the various other artists featured on Drive is great! The soundtrack added a lot to the atmosphere and emotion of the film.<br /><br />The blu-ray of Drive has amazing video and audio quality. I highly recommend Drive!
B004ZJZQ5G|5.0|This is, IMHO, close to being a geat, classic movie. The two 'leads', Keira Knightly & Matthew Macfadyen, were really, really good. But the secondary characters made this movie.<br /><br />Donald Southerlin (Mr. Bennett) was superb, as always! But Tom Hollander (As Mr. Collins), Simon Woods (Bingely) and  Rosamund Pike (Jane Benntt) were very, very good.<br /><br />And Judi Dench (as Lady Catherine de Bourg - perhaps better known as 'M' from James Bond fame) is quite simply one of the greatest actresses of our time.<br /><br />I also enjoyed the costumes and the overall look of the movie.<br /><br />The story did stray from the book some, especially in the Bennetts fiancial situtation. But most of the changes otherwise were needed to movie the story along. Having read the book many, many moons ago I recogizied most of the changes but after re-reading the book I noticed more changes. None of them really bothered me however.<br /><br />I would rate this a very high 9.25 to 9.5 out of 10 - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for fans of the book, historical romance fans and people who just like good movies!!
B009NF54ZE|4.0|This is a good game.  I wish I could see who is doing the talking.  The mini games are fun to play. Sometimes the conversations are too long between the characters.  Overall it is fun to play.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|I love this game.It's just like the PC version!If you like Minecraft then you will LOVE this game.I know I do!!!
1118109791|4.0|I practice on this and then go back and practice on my weakness. This contains past exams and provide your with a great practice set... This however needs to be complemented with a fantastic content book set - Manhattan GMAT.
B00D48BT5A|5.0|An easy to read novel with a fascinating historical factual  overlay .  I love bill Bryson's literary style of writing
B0000TB01Y|3.0|Saw this show in Melbourne Australia, would not rave over it apart from being a fair nights entertainment. The staging was excellent but most of the songs were mostly forgetable. You certainly do not come out of the theatre humming a tune
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|A good re-introduction for Doctor Who. All good episodes, some very good e. g : &#34;The Empty Child & &#34;The Doctor Dances&#34;. Very much in keeping with the spirit of the original series with shorter but more intense stories and really nice special effects. In the interest of full disclosure I am a long time Doctor Who Fanatic
B00GH4RKYM|5.0|Great way to lay the foundation of the original superman. Love Russell Crowe. Good action. Good acting. Looking forward to the next one.
B007EC27QM|5.0|Use it all the time. Take it with me on my kindle when I  go food shopping . Keep track so I don't go over my budget. The numbers are large easy on the eyes. Very easy to use as well ! You won't go wrong using this app.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Love this game it's challenging yet fun! Something quick while waiting out and about. Was recommended by an 80 year old woman... Good for all ages
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Very Good Book & I Reccomend it 100 %<br />Now one of my favorite books & you should read it too .
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This game is good who ever put one star maybe didn't know how to play it right. I give 5
B004XANKVO|5.0|Love it!! It has been great backpack for traveling and carries my 15&#34; macbook pro with an iPad plus lot more...the hard sunglasses case is great too.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I play on Facebook everyday.  Now I can play all the time as my Kindle is always down in my purse.  LOVE IT!!!!
B0050X1OQ6|5.0|Upgraded my Synology DS1512+ from 1G to 3G using this RAM about a week ago. The sever works so much efficiently. I can stream movings over the internet and pictures just pop up on photo station rather than seeing the spoke wheel in the beginning...
030758836X|1.0|This book I read mostly because of the reviews I had read. It was a great disappointment though when I did read it.
B00G21XNKU|5.0|The 50th Anniversary edition did not disappoint, it was exciting!  The plot twists and turns and keeps viewers guessing. It is interesting to see the doctor's character change and develop. I am looking forward to the new season!
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|lovely record - thought I ordered the vinyl version but received the cd instead ... still love her music... awesome
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a fun game, I like how it changes for holidays. I would recommend it to others who like games.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|When I first got this game I thought that it would be like one of those bad free games that don't work  right. This game is not one of those games, it runs flawless on my kindle fire. I recommend you get this game.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I wished I could return this book. I only paid five dollars and still feel ripped off. I was bored with the amount of sex they were having and every time I thought something would happen it was so…boring. Eva made have had a lot of climaxes in the book, but the book itself was totally lacking a climax!
B00BU18U82|4.0|Fun game to play but before you go too far check out the brand new one! This deserves four stars any day just a little bit too much in app purchasing. Other than that get this game!
B007Y6OZE0|5.0|Great cd great band!!!!! Very fun music!!!! Great band to see live !!!!!! You wont be disappointed in this cd!!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love the game.Thanks for making it!!! Nice game.It's an awesome game indeed I love you guys for the game!!!!!!!
B000EGDC0A|5.0|Excellent music - Goldfrapp's voice gets a little too repetitious at times, but the CD is overall excellent. I wish her other releases were more like this one.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Decent game. Dont like to pull the thing back rather than just tap to shot. Other than that not bad s
1892005034|5.0|If you can get past the mildly patronizing tone in which this book is written, the teachings therein really have the potential to change your life- improving your relationships and especially the relationship with the self. Well at least that was true for me. Worth a try, anyhow.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book was amazing and everyone should read it it has so many meanings to it and relates to life so much it will change you
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|The movie held my interest and I was hoping that at the end Denzel's character would do the right thing.  I think the movie was very good as it reinforced many of my own values.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Great concept but exceedingly slow and or unresponsive. Maybe I expect too much, but it does not respond or it freezes with my Samsung Galaxy phone. Also just leaving it plugged into my television (not turned on at the phone), blows my TV reception.<br />Other than that, it`s a great product.
B00BXDOSXS|2.0|That this is malware on my Kindle Fire HD 7&#34;. Even though I opened it and played a movie, I took it off because of Norton.  This is the 1st time that I ever downloaded a program and Norton game me a warning.
0385528787|5.0|Wonderful book. While not necessary to have read the previous 2 books in the trilogy, it definitely helps clarify people and events.(I found myself going back to the older books to jog my memory.) Many times I found myself thinking, hmm, this could really happen. Reminiscent of The Handmaid's Tale in that respect. Ms.Atwood has been one of my favorite authors for years and in my opinion this is one of her best works. This is the best book I have read in 2013.
B008K6HN8I|4.0|I can see all the files on my Kindle Fire HD 7&#34; - and I also can access any computer on my network.
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|Would be five stars except the energy that runs out and has to recharge. Best boxing app i have ever used.
B00A3VLJCE|4.0|I am able to use this on my Kindle Fire HD - previewing different settings while on the road.  Once I am home, I use Photoshop CS4 to make the final effects, etc. to my pix.
B008Y7J91M|5.0|I really enjoyed Frances O'Connor's performance.  The story was a good look at the motivations of different people.  The ending is super nice.
B008M721MS|4.0|On my Kindle Fire HD 7&#34; - I wouldn't change a thing about it.  I use it when I am not on my laptop, or when on the road.
B00ECUARO8|5.0|The child performers were wonderful.  The story centers around love, always a good topic for me.  Matthew McConaughey shows us a grittier side of himself which was welcome.
B00DZAWPNM|5.0|Excellent! Each song moves into the next one flawlessly and at the same time are unique. You can find your mood easily: dancing, slow dancing, listening and everything in between. This is the first album I buy from them after following their work based on what is played on the radio. An extremely pleasant surprise and I love following them on twitter!
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Love this movie!!!!! AAAAAMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Its a great story, graphics are incredible! Just a great movie overall! Just as good as the book
B00GIXWXEO|3.0|Just ok. The story line was kind of cheesy. That being said, my 5 year old son enjoyed it because of the fast cars and racing.
B004LP3AYI|5.0|Starts off slow but it's a great read. Keep on reading and never give up because the climax is very enjoyable. Richard and Khalan is the ideal of a couple who are deeply in love.  This novel is a love story and to know your partner is very important.
B001XV3LSS|5.0|If someone has not seen this movie by now I would seriously be surprised.  One of the best with an incredible cast.  Important to remember the words of Carl Sagan who inspired the movie.  &#34;If we are all that there is it would be an terrible waste of space&#34;.  A movie everyone can agree is worth every minute you watch it.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Great game. Love challenging my son in competitions.  The graphics and animation are very realistic. My only qualms with it is how long it takes to refresh energy
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love using Pintrest on the computer and I was so excited to see there was an app on the kindle fire. This app is very addictive though.
B00992CF6W|5.0|To the creators,<br />I wish you could blow up dynamite and build a nether portal. I also wish that there was flint and steel. Can't ever stop playing it it was worth seven dollars.
B00FMJJ064|5.0|This album is great for people who love instrumental music. I love this album! i listen to it all the time!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I love how you can get the thrill of the hunt while sitting safely at home.  It's realistic and the graphics are very good.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|This game is awesome but I do wish we could get more bingos and bingo chips. Also I wish we could use the money we win to buy more bungle chips.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|I'm starting to like the diary of a wimpy kid searires<br /><br /> How do you make the diary of the wimpy kid books?
B00395ZYVS|5.0|A story that tugs the heart strings in a very special way.  It's sentimental, realistic and never manipulative.  This story actually changed my stereotyped opinions of India.  The characters were so beievable and likeable, easy to identify with.  It's easy to live every moment of the journey and actions.  A story for all Mothers to contemplate while enjoying!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|i love this game its fun i play it 24/7. no lie i have a kindle fire and its just the right size. i have gotte&ntilde; a high &sect;core that was high my mom gets mad at me because im so good. i love this game
B005721W9O|5.0|Such a funny movie, my girlfriend hadn't seen it yet. It has really aged well in my opinion, it's still entertaining and hilarious. Was surprised at how much i remembered from watching it as a kid.
B00EMAGCJM|1.0|What happens when Cyrus wants to show her kids (probably won't find a man to have them with) this album? &#34;Look, theirs mommy twerking on Robin Thicke.&#34; &#34;Look at me naked,doing my song Wrecking Ball!&#34;  Miley, you are right, you're 21, but you are acting like a toddler. Stop the tongue thing, put on some clothes, and stop being fake. We Can't Stop? You Should. And yes, that &#34;Wrecking Ball&#34; CLEARLY wrecked you. I mean, look at yourself, and think is this right? Oh, yes, btw, I saw you smoke marijuana on stage.
B00GP0G0IK|5.0|This game is the bomb.  one of the best that I have played in a long time. Keep up the good work G5
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Enjoyed this so much. Just hard enough to make it a challenge, but not so hard you get frustrated. Can't wait for more!
B004LP3AYI|5.0|I couldn't read it fast enough! I really enjoy this series and can't wait to start the next book in the series
B0097JYVAU|5.0|For anyone working on prediction, data, statistics this book is a must. It covers a variety of topics: sports, chess, politics, macroeconomics, stock markets, natural or manmade disasters, weather and climate. But even for non specialists, this book is fun to read. It is not esoteric, you don't need to be a prediction expert to read it. You can enjoy it on your sofa like a novel and still comprehend all ideas. It is fun, read it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|LOVE this game it is so much fun I enjoy caring for my horse and petting and feeding it. don't forget shopping for stuff for you and your horse!
B000002JSP|5.0|Any time there are no issues with on line shopping it is a good day.....this was an excellent day.....great nostalgic Zeppelin....excellent deep cuts i had not heard for decades....glad to have the CD version so i don't need to risk loss of the the original LP version
1489559396|5.0|I read and LOVED Beyond Bridalveil Fall, the first book in the Dwellers Of Ahwahnee series, so I just couldn't wait to delve into the second book: Beyond Oria Falls. I love all of the magical ambiances and the mystical elements to this story. It was definitely gripping, intriguing, and I couldn't put it down! I absolutely love Oria and her tribal members. I absolutely recommend this series to anybody that enjoys young adult fantasy series, and this one has such a unique twist!
B000000OU0|5.0|The CD arrived in perfect condition.  It's the Eagles, they are the best.  What more can you say about the Eagles.
B008BM9L72|4.0|I liked it - the first 2 books were great then the last book kind of dragged on. Still worth a read tho so don't go past this book!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This was a great book! I loved how the characters were separate and how they slowly came together to form the perfect, ironic little novel.

B000FA675C|5.0|Outstanding. Had to read and re-read several parts. I can see how it might make some people with strong religious beliefs a little uncomfortable, but to me it made sense as another likely possible path. I found the book entirely engaging and gave me a lot to think about.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I loved this book, very depressing but in a good way. I rated this four stats because this is the hones truth. I did not rate it five stars because it was the honest truth, this world needs a mystery and so did  book just like the imperial attraction did. I would recommend this book for a fourteen year old<br />, I am a twelve year old and I read higher books than a high schoolers. I would dedicate this to my uncle which is dying of cancer. This his last few days. God bless your soul.<br /><br />Marisa
B00G32OER4|5.0|I'm not easily pleased and an avid fan of paranormal/demonic books and films to recognize this is top notch.  Well written and crafted film. Fantastic acting, particularly on the part of the children, and unequivocally Terrifying. James Wan has shown Phenomenal talent - looking forward to more great stuff from him! Highly recommend this - its a classic.
B008MM9630|5.0|I played this game on my iPhone no  I play it on my kindle. I love it. I would recommend to any one any age.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|So important. So much! This was so valuable to me and so worth it. Thank you mr. Zusak. Really, thanks.
B009C7JS14|5.0|This app is great and completely compatable with my device. It's easy to use and it gives you even the most descriptive feedback on the weather
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Enjoyable series that present historical England in a believable manner. Reflecting that the issues back then remain the issues of today but I will say that the portrayal of how they dealt with those issues then is something we can learn from now.  True tolerance, respect, kindness, honesty and justice are reflected in the characters as they engage with one another despite all those human vices of pride and prejudice that are there too. It's just refreshing to see people  take responsibility for their wrongs and resort to words and actions of reparation to work the issues out rather than violence.
B00EI4V3X2|3.0|As of the time of this review, chat functionality on the PS4 is not COMPLETELY wireless.  In its current state, the headset will not connect to the PS4 via Bluetooth thus forcing you to use the 2.5mm to 3.5mm jack adapter that plugs into your controller.  While it works, it's still not wireless.<br /><br />Setup is somewhat cumbersome in that I needed to get ANOTHER fiber optic cable to hook into the wireless adapter (sorry, the supplied cable is thinner than angel hair and doesn't warrant a &#34;why not&#34; from me) which acts as a pass-through for your home receiver in addition to feeding your headset the sound it needs for Dolby Digital Surround production.<br /><br />And how is that production?  Well, I have mixed feelings on that front.  For $149, even with all of its &#34;wireless&#34; trappings, I would still expect bass reproduction to be on par with a $100 pair of headphones at least.  It's not.  It wasn't with the PX3s either and the Turtle Beach moniker has long worn out its welcome; the prestige that they once held in PC sound boards from long ago has left them quite some time ago.  My Afterglow's actually sound better than this set.  Chat is serviceable, but I wish that the game audio was better and had more punch.<br /><br />The microphone does have a welcome feature of being removable should you choose to use it strictly for listening to game audio and not disturbing the entire household.<br /><br />Another welcome and surprising feature was its ability to pair to 2 Bluetooth devices:  1) for the wireless sound transmitter and 2) for a phone.  Now you can actually answer a phone call while you're gaming and not miss a call as a result.  This is also welcome should you decided that you have a need to call a friend to see if they're having connectivity issues for a multiplayer session, etc.<br /><br />However, it's still missing quite a bit for me to say that it's worth a buy.  The wireless aspect from a PS4 standpoint is not completely on Turtle Beach's end, but my take on this is that you shouldn't release a product until it's truly ready for what it's intended for.  Also, the audio setup for the wireless connector is simply annoying and the supplied optical cable is laughable - I'm afraid that this thing is going to snap like a twig if I inadvertently grab it the wrong way.  Sound reproduction from a directionality standpoint is decent, but I want to FEEL explosions in Battlefield 4, not merely acknowledge that something happened on mid/high frequencies.  I'm hoping that Turtle Beach comes to their senses there.
B00GM9G476|3.0|I had high hopes for this movie the previews I saw of it made me want to watch it as soon as it came out.........but sadly enough even this movie with GREAT and beautiful Scenery along with really good fighting scenes is not entirely about IP MAN it does have him but then it shifts focus to different characters that would have been great if they came after IP MAN to fight for the right to be the grand master but instead he fights 2 times and the rest is the story of a secret admirer who has to fight to regain family honor nothing to do with IP MAN
B0019LY5IM|1.0|Ever read Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain where they held a show run by two con-men called &#34;The Royal Nonesuch&#34;?  Well, when the townspeople rode those two con-men out on a rail, I felt pretty much the same way when I saw this final season.  I felt cheated, angry, disappointed and misled.
B00009ZYC0|3.0|The pictures in the movie is of rather low quality...it is like those VCD we used to watch a decade ago.
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|Not as much action and the &#34;new&#34; Bond with the darkness of his character make it a bit hard to enjoy, but overall a win.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|You can usually trust Clancy's books and this one was no exception. Full story and action with Ryan Jr. Interesting action book.
B007R11DKQ|5.0|Solid movie with a good cast.  It keeps you involved in the action and makes you focus on the story line.
B005GFPZYK|2.0|I really waited quite much from this book, but was really disappointed. It seems that this guy just wants to tell how he is the best sniper in the history and trying to claim that he is actually modest. Not really, quite horrible book and this guy has some serious issues.
B00G5G7EXY|5.0|I don't know about you, but I remember a time where Disney reign supreme in the genre of animation.  Classics like Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin and The Lion King; aw, those were day. These days, on the other hand, the animated trend of Disney has died down. Yet, when an animated film does pop up, it can be a treat. That brings us to latest animated Disney feature: Frozen. After the success of Tangled, Frozen would be worked on the 2010 film's creators and be another Disney movie completely CG.  Though Tangled prove Disney Animation could be brought in a different light, how does Frozen fair in Disney's long list of animated classics?<br /><br />The tale of Frozen deals with two princess: Anna (Kristen Bell) and Elsa (Idina Menzel). While things have been peaceful in the kingdom Arendelle, there is a secret in the royal family: Elsa has the power to control ice. After a dramatic situation, Elsa's powers go out of control bringing an eternal winter to Arendell. Anna journeys after Elsa with  the mountain man Kristoff (Johnathan Groff), his trusty reindeer Sven and a living snowman named Olaf (Josh Gad). Together, the four journey into a wilderness so they can save kingdom as well as Elsa.<br /><br />While there are many classic Disney films, sometimes the films' plot can be repetitive. Frozen, on the other hand, does not fall under such stereotypes. Thanks to the two plots of Anna and Elsa, Frozen's plot was very refreshing. Plus, the pacing of the story was great by making Frozen an adventurous tale that really stood out.<br /><br />With a great story came wonderful characters. It almost hard to decide who was the superior character among the ensemble. Kristen Bell brought a charismatic performance as Anna; while surprising me in other areas. Idina Menzel brought her voice and belting ability as Elsa, who was just a different kind of Disney Princess. I even liked Kristoff and Olaf, and normally can't stand the generic male love interest and comedic relief. On paper,the cast to Frozen didn't look like it was going to work. Yet in the end, this ensemble was hard not to love.<br /><br />To say Frozen's animation was great seems a little redundant seeing that Disney film usually shine in this element; but Frozen has some wonderful animation. What stands out in the animation is the use of the colors and lights. This help thing such as the character stand out from the likes of Tangled's cast. Along with the animation came the music. The score by Christophe Beck was impressive, and even more so was the fact that Frozen was a musical. Speaking of musicals: Frozen has to be the one best Disney musicals in a very long time. The reason why the element work was because the movie treated itself like a Broadway musical. A rare feat, even in Disney films.<br /><br />This is the point where I talked about which scenes stood out me. In the case of Frozen, the moments that stood out to me were the musical numbers. The big songs, \\"First Time In Forever\\" and \\"Let It Go\\", were great.\\"First Time In Forever\\" was a fantastic title song giving us great moments between Anna and Elsa; plus the sound was soothing. Then there was Elsa's big song: Let it Go. The song was catchy and just great for the character. I am willing to bet that these songs will be remember in the years to come.<br /><br />If you haven't guessed yet: I liked Frozen. The film was a treat for families and fans of both animation and Disney. With a compelling story, memorable character and  the Broadway atmosphere, Frozen is indeed a hit. This film is not just one of the best of the year, but it is one the best Disney for quite sometime.<br /><br />See review here: [...]

0425166805|5.0|reading it now, and i have to say many of my questions as a child are being &#34;answered&#34; or &#34;brought to light&#34; so to speak.. it makes sense of all the religions around the planet, it sheds light on a subject that is so intense, that many religions are afraid you will not need them any longer, or your money wont be coming in anymore, its really a sad day when we as intellectuals believe in a book written by people who only want to control you and tell you how to live.but keep you in the dark and instill fear so you wont question anything and just obey.<br />the bible in my mind is a book of abductions, and stories of how to be a better person, but at the same time a book of riddles to keep you under a spell of blind innocence,<br />&#34;GOD&#34; does not want you to be docile and numb, god would want all of us to enhance our lives creatively and spiritually . explore al aspects around us and beyond our grasp.  he would not want you to sacrifice a child or any other being for that matter. just to prove a point of loyalty to him. that is just asinine. that sounds more like a man with psychotic issues that need to be addressed, my GOD would not be vengeful  or spiteful . my GOD is a loving caring understanding free-willed being, who also gave us free will. but at the same time a sense or living life to help others move forward, not to drag kill or tear them down mentally or physically
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book has been an amazing experience to read. Written in a most unique style, it's completely captivating, heartbreaking, endearing, frightening and has touched my heart more profoundly than any other book I've read in a very long time. I'd give it TEN stars if I could. When a book enables the reader to feel the complete spectrum of emotions, there's nothing else to give it but the highest praise. Well done and many thanks to author Marcus Zusak.
