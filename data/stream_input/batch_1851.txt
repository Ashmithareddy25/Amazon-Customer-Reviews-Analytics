B006ATJXQW|2.0|Loved the series but this prequel did not fit.  It introduced too many new characters that were unnecessary to the story line.  I was disappointed.
B003WKOU0G|4.0|This is one of those films that really stands out from the rest, great job in doing something different and unique.<br />I only wish there would be children from other continents like South Asia and Latin America.
B004JN1CW4|4.0|Loved this series!  It was hard to put down.  Loved the characters.  Great storyline.  Ending wasn't conclusive though which bothered me a little.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Unlike many games for the tablets, Where's My Perry is both inexpensive and well worth the cost.  The gameplay has a steady difficulty curve to keep it interesting without becomine too hard too quickly.  +1 would play again.
B003F3FJQO|4.0|I loved this series.  Couldn't put it down.  Highly recommend it.  I loved the characters and storyline. Well written and fast-paced suspense.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|its a pretty cool game if you like to take time getting weapons and earning prizes to kill zombies with your own army while protecting yourself and a sacred gate.
B0064TVQ5E|1.0|I purchased this for free but it did not download even though I followed instructed so I ended up paying $1.05 for this since it wouldn't download.  Can I get a credit for this since it was supposed to be free and had to purchase it in order to download it again!!!!  I did not get your e-mail until after I repurchased the game with your instructions on how to fix it. Thank you.
B0041KVW2K|3.0|The albums are the UK versions. If you grew up in the U.S. and played the U.S. versions a lot, you might be dissapointed as I don't believe the songs were always in the same order and some were on different albums altogether. Keep that in mind.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I was a Pinterest addict before but it's so Mich easy to look at, re-pin, &amp;&nbsp;create with the Kindle app
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|This movie is not for all. But if your looking for a movie where Wahlberg and a teddy bear share some hilarious moments this is going to be a good rental. Make sure you rent this when you want to watch a crude comedy.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I need potatoes. I like potatoes. And I love you would you marry me? I want to marry pie. This is a book that is about stuff. And words. :) SMILEY FACE
B0095R64AO|3.0|Usually don't enjoy these movies. Jason and his buddy make the movie for me with crude one liners that will make your wife blush. I would say this is a chick flick but at least there is some good humor to get the guys through. They should put his in the crudmedic love film category.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|I needed a potato you look like a potato. I like pie. And i love you would you marry me?
B00APUYWYA|4.0|One of my wife's new favorite movies. Similar to glee but way funnier. There is a lot of singing throughout the movie but it is tolerable.
B009ZE27US|1.0|okay props because its sort of funny on the first couple tries but after a while its just very stupid and / wouldn't get it again.:*(
B00AMBH70S|3.0|Not sure why I saw some bad reviews. This movie stays on the same story line as the other Bournes just with a different main character. Great close quarter battle and chase scenes thought the movie. This movie is not an Oscar but very entertaining none the less. Rent it.
B003VXPIXW|5.0|This guy eats all the food and turns out beautiful!  Now that is pure fantasy without any shame...<br />Good for the soul.
B00846F1YW|1.0|same problem as everyone else. Stops at level 13 after finding hidden objects. please fix!!  So frustrating. especially when you pay for an app.
0307279189|5.0|I still get emotional about this book when I think of it.  I think because I was never able to really run well.  When I finished it, I hugged it to my chest and didn't want to let it go.  Thank you, Christopher, for writing this book.  I am 72 and have never hugged a book before.  Read three other books in the last 4 months that were wonderful but I didn't hug them.  But this book still makes me well up after three months of reading it.  My friend, who is a runner, said he liked the book but never felt like hugging it.

B007TXN4TK|5.0|Tried this app for free tos ee if we liked it as to not waste money. I am now going back to buy the full version, which we rarely do. THis app is fun and I think encourages my kids to want to play the piano, boost confidence and helps them see it is not that hard. :)  Lots of fun and easily downloaded MUST HAVE APP if 2012.
0061537934|5.0|While I am a dog-lover to be sure, this is not just a dog book.  This is a wonderful story that carries with it a whole lot besides dog-loves-man stuff.  The story of a dog who believes in reincarnation, it presents some other ideas that are thought-provoking as well.  Ideas that are refreshing these days: &#34;What you manifest is before you.&#34; is the one I particularly liked.  The idea that we are responsible for the vast majority of the content of our lives.  No one else is, just us.  Our decisions, our choices, our preferences, our hurts, our responses to the world outside us, our expectations, our beliefs...all these intangibles that belong to each of us alone, and we have the ability to shift the whole course of our lives --or not--by the way we use these.  The story line itself is sweet, with villainous villains, a wonderful love story, an uplifting relationship between father and child, and of course, the fabulous (and frustrated because he can't talk and doesn't have thumbs) Enzo.  Oh yes, its also a book about the art of racing.  For those of you familiar with the sport of fast car racing of any ilk, the descriptions of what it takes mentally to race a car are extremely spot-on.  I suspect the author has done his time behind a wheel...This is a wonderful, multi-layered book with a whole lot in it.  It's a fast read but for me, it left me thinking about things for a long time afterward.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|I enjoyed seeing the movie on tv; but the extended collector's edition is even more awesome. and I can watch it as often as I like!
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|Hilarious! Must check this out. If you are looking for a funny movie to watch with a date this is it.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Any book with Harry Bosch is great as far as I'm concerned. This one didn't let me down! Can't wait for the next one.
B009NPA3MS|4.0|I knew early in the competition that Phillip Phillips was the one contestant with the ability to be a star.  I wrote this to the judges on their web site.  They were continually raving about two other contestants and barely commenting on Phillip.  I wrote, &#34; Screaming is not singing and is not musical.  Phillip is the one with talent.&#34;  Evidently America agreed with me.
B0027MJU00|2.0|....so much so that I will not download another of Gillian Flynn's works.  I hope that she has an extremely perverted sense of creativity and not the disturbed mind that could be living with such depressing and Satan- is -tic thought patterns.<br />A disturbing read. I usually cannot remember what I dream but this book made me wake up at night feeling anxious about dreaming scenes from this book.<br /><br />What did I like?  When a writer jumps back and forth in time when telling a story.  I'm sure other readers will like her vertical line writing but it just slowed the reading down. Unique... I'll give her that, but when I start something I don't  stop until it's finished!  Although this book caused me to experience a few bad dreams,  I just wanted to hurry up and finish it.......mainly  to know `who done it` .
B003O3EKTC|5.0|good conditions excellent ,great movie of the 80's no scratch on the cd would recommend this buyer to every one
B0076DELIG|5.0|Excellent story telling once again.  Fast paced, interesting story line and Harry shines through once again. Really enjoying his interaction with his daughter getting involved in his cases.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I enjoyed reading something outside of my usual mystery, and did enjoy following these characters throughout.  I enjoyed the story.
B004WMKSH2|3.0|It was definitely a mistake to get the non-HD version of this movie. The movie was pretty good but the quality of the video was horrible. Go HD or consider another option if downloading this.
0596009208|3.0|Typically, I have trouble doing the first thing.  The tutorial programs wouldn't compile using the compiler that came on my iMac and there were no hints from the book that this might happen or what to do about it.  As a reference book, it is weak.  My opinion is that this would be a great book to learn from in a classroom setting with an expert available to fix things that don't work.  I bought this book from Amazon after I bought another book from a bookstore which I read first -- I learned a lot from that book because I wasn't trying to compile anything.
B007TMON8M|5.0|my brother has this app on his iPod and i play it all the time. I decided to look it up on the kindle app store. I LOVE IT!!!! i play it all the time and my mom likes it because it is educational.

B00003CWL6|5.0|This is possibly one of the best indie movies of all time, especially considering when it was made.  Great parody.
B005LAIHY0|4.0|Although its not the best in the Alien story, I loved Prometheus because of its very true to form return of the SciFi thriller. It's been a long time since I've felt the feeling the origionals gave me.
072325804X|5.0|I always loved these stories growing up. For Christmas this year I bought this book for both of my young nieces and then also bought one for me and my sister. Neither of us have children yet but this is a definite must have for any family.
B00000I8UF|5.0|During the late 1950's there was one artist who was intent on challenging the intellectual preconceptions of the modern jazz movement of the era,and along with his musicians searching for new ways to bring jazz closer to it's African American roots. Not only that but he himself looked upon the groups he worked with as training grounds for younger musicians to branch off and create their own innovations as well,and that included everyone from Lee Morgan all the way up to Wynton Marsalis. This man and his group was Art Blakey & The Jazz Messengers. Because the lineup and size and jazz of the Messengers was extremely flexible,their sound and style could pretty much be whatever Blakey himself saw it needed to be at any given time-reflected not only the music but the culture taking place around it. As far as I know,this is their most famous and revered album.<br /><br />  Interestingly enough,this CD reissue opens up with a bonus track: a 35 second \\"warm up\\" with trumpeter Lee Morgan musing about Satchmo before asking Rudy Van Gelder to start the tape. After this we go into the title song,a bluesy affair written by pianist Bobby Timmons. In almost every other sense,tenor saxophonist Benny Golson takes over musically and compositionally on much numbers as the uptempo \\"Are You Real\\" and his soulfully slower \\"Along Came Betty\\"-both of which are driven by his sound alternating from passionate wails to fast paced emotional intensity. Golson also wrote one of my favorite numbers here \\"Blues March\\"-he and Lee Morgon really get the theme going strong with Blakey himself keeping an almost ragtime friendly \\"big four\\" going behind it before launching it all into the soulful hard bop the Messengers made famous,and keeping it right up until \\"Come Rain Or Come Shine\\" at the end.<br /><br />  Of course there's also  \\"Drum Thunder Sweet\\",another Golson number where Blakey himself goes from a afro cuban,to swing and than to a more eastern style of drumming with the quinter keeping up with him at every turn. Another of my own favorite pieces here. This is truly a fabulous album. And I'd easily recommend it to anybody who is just starting to build their jazz collection. Reason for this is that every member of this quintet is heard very distinctly here showcasing their individual musical talents extremely well within the conversational nature of the jazz quintet format. Lee Morgan's trumpet is often singing and melodic,Golson is superb at expressing the wide range of his feelings on sax and Blakey absolutely likewise. And of course bass player Jymie Merrit and pianist Bobby Timmons add many colors,like a watercolor painter to a canvas. To extend the theme,a lively and captivating musical work of art.h him at every turn. Another of my own favorite pieces here. This is truly a fabulous album.

B0018CENUC|5.0|Recomended to all that like Toby Keith, Great Songs And even better than that Great Price, Highly recoment this Album
B008J34466|4.0|I think Pink has a tremendous voice, and most of her songs are really great...I just wish she could work on cleaning up the music a bit.  I feel like she could be just as successful without all the profanity.
1878424319|5.0|I recommend this for anyone needing guidance and gain wisdom.  I bought 8 books for christmas to give away.  I have the audio book and have listened to it several times.  It really makes you think and lifts you up.
B008XOXGCO|4.0|Wasn't as good as their previous CD &#34;Science and Faith&#34;, but was still a great listen.  They had a few profane words that could have been omitted with little affect on the quality of the music.  Still one of the best &#34;new bands&#34; out there.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|After all the comments and reviews I saw on Amazon and from friends I expected more sex. Don't get me wrong there was some sex.. and some dirty sex but for me it was just meh... didn't bother reading the other 2.

B006M7JCC2|4.0|Anita Moorjani has a story to tell! Life is worth living and should be lived fearlessly and to the last drop! She went through a near death experience after a serious illness and has since been able to return to life and share her experiences with us all. Well worth reading - especially if you have a serious illness yourself!
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I heard great things about this show and after I started watching it - I couldn't stop. Best show ever!
B005NJU8PA|5.0|I'm a longtime Tim Ferris fanboy (since The 4-Hour Workweek) but this book really ties it all together. &#34;Meta-Learning&#34; (or learning how to learn) is one of the most useful things anyone could ever learn.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Loved the excitement of new love. I started dating my husband in Vegas, so that made me love it more :)
B005IQ39AY|5.0|This starts out easy enough and then it gets harder and harder. it really makes you have to think in order to get the best shot.
B00846REIS|5.0|Sylvia Day's writing is amazing. It is sharp,smart and well thought through. This is the smarter version of 50 shades. This book puts 50 shades to shame. I liked these characters 100% more
B004YM6JLO|5.0|Solid season. Not quite as good as Season 2, but Season 3 showed us a taste of the show we would rather be watching: \\"The Originals\\". The questionable history they employ to show the origins will make even non-history buff's weep, but The Originals are AWESOME. Season 3 gave Paul Wesley an opportunity, as \\"The Ripper\\" to flex his acting chops and it was a truly great arch for the show.<br /><br />My only real issue with the season is that with so many interesting and complex mythologies and characters to explore, the show moves too fast to keep us as invested in a central love triangle and the parties. I know a lot of fans are VERY involved in this aspect of the show, but as it drags out, I see it as a deficit to the individual characters involved. Three seasons of \\"It's ALLLLLL about Elena!\\" takes away from the lightening fast plot developments and a world of opportunities that opened up with the introduction of the Mikealsons.<br /><br />Season 3 saw The Vampire Diaries as still a great show. That makes this DVD a must own for any fan.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Wow!!!! I am so enthralled in this series. Sylvia Day is a brillant writer. She puts 50 Shades to shame. I have many friends who have read both 50 and this series and everyone has said the Crossfire series is so much better. I cannot wait for the final installment. Smart, sharp writing.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|I was not very impressed with the app because you can only see the first 10 or so entries of any group and/or the news feed.  I prefer to go to the website.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|Im not a fan of these types of movies. thought i would watch it with my husband n nod my way thru. Surprisingly enjoyed it start to finish.  havent laughed so hard in a while
B00A8Z6KN8|5.0|Bought this the day after seeing the movie.  I love it, some similar sounds to the music for Lord of the Rings but has its own melody that flows through the entire score.  Hands down my favorite track is Misty Mountains.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Another good Harry Bosch episode. I particularly liked the interaction with his daughter. She may become a feature character on her own some day.
B0001I561E|5.0|I would certainly recommend this Disney movie to anyone as well as a few others. Great songs and great storyline for a children's movie
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|Not the best Pixar movie, but certainly not the worst. Like all the Pixar movies, I enjoyed it. It's fun, it tugs on your heart feeling thingys, and it has a message. When my 2 year old girl is a bit older she will appreciate it more I think. Plus, I might be weird but, you can't go wrong with an attractive and feisty red head.
B000F8O35U|5.0|One of my favourite Disney movies along with Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King. Lives up to expectations
B00785P2QC|4.0|I have a lot of downtime at work. Great game to kill time. Only negative is you outgrow your expansions quickly.
B009E3EY38|5.0|What else can I say. Ever since &#34;the Zep&#34; played there one and only reunion concert at the O2 Arena I have been hearing fans and critics rave about the quality of the show, Plant's voice, Jimmy's guitar and all the rest of it. Then I missed the movie theater viewings.. How could I? Now I had a chance to confirm it. It is truly an awesome show. I have watched the show a couple times and I gravitate towards the songs every time I want to hear music on my phone.<br /><br />If you are a Zep fan and you didn't get it yet, shame on you.
030758836X|3.0|I checked out the audio version at my library and after listening to 75% of the book I was sure it would be one of my new favorites.  But today I finally came to the end and can't even begin to describe my disappointment.  I won't spoil it for anyone, so I won't go into detail... but one of the previous reviews said it felt like the author just didn't know how to end it.  I agree!!  The book has fabulous plot twists and turns... I was so impressed with the writing (and the narrators in the audiobook do a GREAT job!!) but the ending just cancelled out how my enjoyment.  My initial impression was that the book was of the same caliber as \\"Presumed Innocent\\" but then it suddenly became \\"Rosemary's Baby\\". From great suspense novel almost to science fiction!  Very disappointed!  I think \\"Sharp Objects\\" by the same author was a much better book.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|This story had me enthralled from first page to last. Excellent work from Mr. Sanderson, as usual. I love his books and have yet to read a bad one.

B001GQ2TGA|5.0|I discovered this CD two years ago, thinking it might be just &#34;elevator music&#34;. WOW: WRONG! This is some of the most beautiful, COMFORTING music I've discovered in years. Luckily, I had the idea to share it with my largest clients and then extended to more of them. Great idea: feedback from clients is that they LOVE it.
B0068TLD3A|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite books. Now I enjoy reading it with my two grandchildren on a regular basis.  They love it also and look forward to reading this book together.

B007TK77QE|1.0|For the fist time every, gave up reading this book. Only read a third but there seemed to be no real plot
B007FEFLTO|2.0|This is an ambitious project and the execution falls a little short.  It all feels a little too contrived and shallow.  But I've invested enough time in the characters to want to know how they will fare in the rest of the 20th century.
B00AMBLDEE|2.0|I was not impressed. Makes the first 3 shine even brighter.  Watch it though - movies are one of those things.  I didn't like it, but you may.
B002C949KE|5.0|I am recommending this book to friends.  I just need to keep it out of the hands of my wingman.
B0098VYKSA|5.0|I had no desire to watch this movie, but when it was my wife's night to pick, she allowed me to choose between this and October Girl (or something like that).  I picked Snow White.  What a movie!  This story was never meant to be a fairy tale.<br /><br />I was also skeptical because it has that Twilight girl in it.  I never even noticed.  I'll say again; what a movie!  WATCH IT!  You won't be sorry.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|If you haven't seen the youtube video on how this movie was made, please do so. [...]. The weak spot is, as predicted, Russell Crowe. But he gives a passable performance. A little weak in \\"Look Down\\", but does an acceptable job in \\"Confrontation\\" and \\"Stars\\". Sadly, he's down again in \\"Javert's Suicide\\". Samantha Barks is fantastic in \\"On My Own\\". Hugh Jackman is terrific and Anne Hathaway gives the performance of her life. Most of the rest of the cast is great as well.<br /><br />Now, is this as good as \\"The Complete Symphonic Recording\\", which is my favorite of the Broadway/London musical CDs? No. But, a) it's just a highlights disc, and b) it still sounds odd to my ear to hear the songs \\"acted\\". I'm sure I'll change my mind about that once I see it on screen, but for now I'm having difficulty at times getting over my view of what a given song \\"should\\" sound like. This is particularly true with Jackman, who does the best overall job of interpreting the music, but doesn't sound at all like what you've heard for the last 25 years on stage. It's also true with Crowe. As I keep saying, Crowe does a passable job, but he's not the quality of singer that you have heard on various other Les Mis CDs. He's not a bad singer, he just has a very limited range, and the part demands a singer with a better one.<br /><br />EDIT: Having now seen the film, I can perhaps judge better what a full soundtrack will be like. I actually think that the songs on the Highlights disc reveal some of Crowe's weaker performances. He does a bit better in some of the songs that didn't make the disc. And, Anne Hathaway is absolutely brilliant. But it shows just how much you need to experience the visuals to enjoy the movie performances. I loved I Dreamed a Dream when I heard it on the CD. I was amazed when I saw it on screen and heard it in the movie theater. That's where Hollywood and Broadway are so very different. I can listen to my Complete Symphonic Recording over and over and not need to keep the images of the show in my head. I don't think that's possible with this disc. I do have an additional criticism of Jackman, though. I think he slips into a falsetto fairly often where it's not necessary. He'd be better off dropping an octave and doing it in his normal voice. Where he does that, he's terrific. When he goes higher, not so good.<br /><br />Others have criticized these renditions as not being as good as what you hear on Broadway or London. Well, you have to understand what you're getting. Most of these are not Broadway singers. They're Hollywood actors who are singing. And the Golden Age of Hollywood Musicals is long since over. If they could sing as good as a Broadway singer, they'd be doing it on Broadway. If you're expecting a London type performance from this, you're going to be disappointed. Go listen to a London CD or go see it in the theater in London. This is a film experience, not a stage musical. Yes, it has some weaknesses because of that, but it also has it's share of strengths.the images of the show in my head. I don't think that's possible with this disc.

B0085A9HXS|5.0|This has to be one of the best martial films in the past decade. This is a brutal movie with some nice fighting and shoot outs.
B004SEUJUU|5.0|Great movie. Love the special camera tricks. The knives on his fingers look so real when their coming out from his hand.
B007QWF26C|5.0|Wesley Snipes plays Blade in this trilogy of films and boy does he do a great job. Lots of martial arts and sword play here
B000LE16VW|5.0|Always loved this movie. I have it on VHS and needed to upgrade to DVD. Whoopi is so funny! I get a kick out of the way she dressed for her Rita Miller role.
B0020TS5LK|5.0|Wesley Snipes plays Blade in this trilogy of films and boy does he do a great job. Lots of martial arts and sword play here
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|The best game I have played so far. G5 knows there stuff! well worth it.I give it a 5.The game is hard but not so hard you cant finish.
B003O7I6L6|5.0|The cult classic from John Carpenter, Kurt Russell plays Snake a tough criminal who is sent into New York which is now a prison to save the President.
B008DM4OTA|5.0|my four year old neigbor loves it. whenever she comes over she plays this and loves it. I recomend this game. if you don't want this version the free version is great too!
B008RV5K5E|5.0|This is based on the Dark Knight Returns and wow they did a great job. An older meaner and more violent Batman..
0811879631|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my SO and I ended up spending more time looking at the pictures than she did. This book opens your eyes to how incredible and tedious these movies are. Very enjoyable for people who like to absorb interesting information as well as great pictures.
B004L49JYO|5.0|I tell you the Japanese have a twisted imagination, This is a super gory film about the police in the future.
B001EC3JME|5.0|Well made and stays where you put it.  One word of caution:  the &#34;stretch to fit&#34; feature is no joke.  I carry a Fenix E21 in this holster, and I could barely even insert it at first.  Took tremendous effort.  I conditioned the elastic by placing a standard sized Craftsman screwdriver in the holster.  Handle first, obviously.  After leaving this to stretch overnight, the Fenix almost fit too loosely.  Be careful!  This holster really does stretch to fit, and that fitting seems to be permanent.
B0021L9ME6|5.0|Halle Berry plays Catwoman though not the Catwoman from thecomics. I loved it, though it is a bad movie, but if you just have fun with it you will have a good time.
B004SBX112|5.0|Purchased this game for my 5 year old grandson to play on my kindle when he comes to visit.<br /><br />He enjoys it very much and loved the fact that he can play alot of different angry birds games on it for different season i.e. The characters are dressed for Halloween, Christmas etc.
B007NRWLZ0|5.0|Michael Jai White a great martial artist plays Spawn, John Leguizamo plays the clown. This has a cool story that follows the comic pretty well. Todd McFarlane scores with this.
B00005LOUP|5.0|My wife and I love this movie.  It is now a tradition in my house to watch this movie every Christmas season.  This is a classic based on another classic.  We love it.
B005LAIHPY|3.0|This was an okay film, though I wouldn't watch it a second time. This one is a rental, I wouldn't buy it. I wish I didn't.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|My wife and I go through a bunch of Christmas Movies during the Christmas season, and this remains one of our favorites.
B0088X7YU0|5.0|I like the Starship Trooper films, Though I seem to like this CGI film the most. You can do a lot more in CGI. The creatures are awesome and the troopers are the bomb..
B0066WJLU6|3.0|It is what it is.  Nothing exciting to say about it other than it works like a flashlight.  Imagine that!  No matter which color you choose from the vast array of choices, the color that the app gives off does not tint anything in the area you are lighting.  It just illuminates the area in a soft, uncolored light.
B008H6GH8I|5.0|This is the second CGI film and it is just as good as the first. Leon is back for another go around with the zombies.
1451695195|5.0|Very moving and inspiring!  I enjoyed it immensely and read it very quickly.  It is a book that I am sharing with others.
B007PZ6T80|5.0|I think this was Dolph Lundgren's first movie and it was great. He plays a Russian super soldier, the team is called the Red Scorpions. There is a ton of action in this movie, one to get for sure.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I went to the movie with my mom not knowing anything about the books or even the plot. After I saw it I knew I had to read the books. And this book was incredible! I couldn't put it down. Now that I've read it I want to watch the movie again to compare.I have also read the 2nd book and now I'm on the third and I can't wait until the rest of the movies come out.
B007X4ECLY|4.0|This is a pretty good Science Fiction , Action movie. Guy Pearce is sent into a space prison to rescue some important visitors.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is the bomb and now they came out with he other one! all though I like the other one a whole lot better!;)
B00A77II0U|5.0|Much fun! Worth the 3 bucks! I hope to see more games like this one on the market! Five stars for sure!
0811879542|5.0|I saw this at the library and I had to get it for my 4 and 2 year olds. They wouldn't put the book down! They love pushing all the dots, and the 4-year-old can guess what is coming and do the appropriate thing to the book as I start to turn the page. It has helped the 4-year-old with left and right and the 2-year-old with colors and numbers (how many times to hit the dot, etc.). I would definitely recommend this to any parent of small children. It is cute, brightly colored, and lets them use their imaginations rather then just having it done for them like so many toys do these days.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I really loved this book. I really loved that both people were honest from the start. I get really sick of romance books where everything starts of with lies and deceit. Yes they were both fooling themselves thinking they could not fall in love with each other but that's different than lying about everything. I'm glad she was never suspected to be a gold digger cause that gets really tedious in these kinds of books as well. I loved both the main characters and it was a really sweet book. I'm glad the author took the time to make them fall in love and it wasn't just an over the night thing, because that really doesn't happen. I definitely recommend reading this story, it was well written and heartwarming.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|As usual, Tim does an amazing job with The 4-Hour Chef. I look forward to implementing many of his cooking/recipe ideas, but I bought this book for everything else: improved learning. The actionable advice is throughout the entire book is complimented with examples of success, and why or why not you should do certain things. Thank you!
B002UPA4ZY|4.0|Worth it for the Muppets sequence.  &#34;He is so slow!&#34;  The rest of the album is great too.  Recommended buy.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|This application flawlessly analyzes the signal strength of your wifi home network. No more guessing of what is the best channel.
B008EZVNO0|1.0|Now that the days of those, like me, who bought \\"Hard Nose the Highway\\" when it was released, are drawing like Mr Morrison's, to a close:  Is the best yet to come, my friends?<br /><br />We, dwellers on the threshold, a little further down the Vanlose Stairway, who have followed Van Morrison this far, hoping to catch him looking ahead to see across the bridge where angels dwell, are likely to be demoralised by this offering and the news that, because there is NO PLAN B, we are going to have to lump it.<br /><br />Before the dawn of the new millennium Van Morrison's matchless \\"High Summer\\", moved away from his usual worship of Celtic light.  We witnessed him courting the forces of darkness.  According to Dennis Wheatley, only a spiritual adept, the like of an Aleister Crowley, could survive such a cataclysmic confrontation.  The Lucifer in the red sports car arriving at \\"the mansion on the hill\\" leaving behind the professional jealousy that has cursed Morrison for years has no rendezvous this time with the \\"Queen of the Slipstream\\"; but a woman of a different order who, making a stand against the light, hums \\"Thank God the dark nights are drawing in again\\".<br /><br />BORN TO SING provides the latest evidence that Morrison's encounter with the forces of darkness has done the man no favours. The whole of this negative album is morose, drawn out and dull.  He sulks: \\"There is no pot of gold at the end of the rainbow\\".  Almost every Van Morrison album has some exquisite example of the High Priest's art; but for a long time the best of the regalia has been ruined by being encroached upon by inferior settings.<br /><br /> In the past, Morrison has shown those of us patient enough to follow the man's drift, how we may be friends with God and his angels; how we, like Ford and Fitzroy ourselves, might break laws for a muse such as Madame George.  Only a great artist can invite us, as he does, to have a friend in the Lord and yet speak with just as much affection for Lucifer:\\"He is a light out of the darkness.\\"  It is God himself who Van Morrison addresses when he sings: \\"Have I told you lately that I love you?\\"  Perhaps, in advance of the new millennium, he gambled that selling his soul to the darker side might pay off.  Perhaps it has.  In this century we have the songs \\"Stranded\\" \\" Celtic New Year\\", \\"Keep it Simple\\", and \\"That's Entrainment\\".  There are a few others but most of the albums have struggled to match those.<br /><br />\\"OPEN THE DOOR TO YOUR HEART\\" suggests that money is just to pay the bills. After wasting too much of my own on albums like \\"Philosopher's Stone\\" or \\"Too long in Exile\\" it is no comfort to be reminded of what I don't want to hear.<br /><br />The money that covers the singer's mileage GOING DOWN TO MONTE CARLO, presumably in the interests of tax avoidance, may be certainly reclaimed as a business expense: \\"After everything I worked so hard for, I'm not goin' to give it all away\\". The town of Nice (25K from Monte Carlo) usefully rhymes with \\"peace\\". \\"Nice\\" also rhymes with \\"briefs\\"; although the revelation about being \\"without my brief\\" is saved for the lifeless MYSTIC OF THE EAST where \\"geese\\" and \\"teeth\\" make up, if not boxer shorts, at least a rhyming pair.<br /><br />Van Morrison is a windbag with a divine sense of humour. His \\"Blah blah blah blah\\" is divinely inspired in \\"Behind the Ritual.\\"  But BORN TO SING costs £8.99 as I write on Amazon. It's not funny.  For £3.99 including post and packing you can save £5; and experience Van Morrison's latest sound, if you are prepared to search on eBay for \\"Inflatable Li-Lo Air Bed\\".  The product is available in three colours.  If you let out the half of the air you can hear, in the exhalation, the baleful sounds of self-reproach that mark this album; particularly if, by sitting on the air bed, you can modulate the note as it passes the valve. On the closing track our Li-Lo idol even blubbers on about a \\"global elite\\"<br /><br />Few of us who prefer to live inthat place \\"where poetic champions compose\\" will ever be praised for having brought Promethean fire down to earth.  Van Morrison is one of them who deserve such honour from us, and in all his recorded work he has either refined his abilities, or assured himself of divine privileges by admitting weakness; and by his truly disarming blatant honesty.  BORN TO SING offers none of these things however; but by its absolute dullness it reminds us of the old crown jewels, of the \\"Queen of the Slipstream\\" for example; to remind us of the eternal sparkle and the living vibrancy that they always had.<br /><br />Those of us framed to look for spiritual succour in the world have found enough beneath the refectory of Van Morrison to keep going back. Some of Van Morrison's spiritual insights are worth having. \\"Keep it Simple\\" and \\"That's that!\\" are two of them.  There are exotic morsels and crumbs too beautiful to eat still; but once upon a time there was real plenty.<br /><br />The morose preoccupation of this album is with money. Perhaps the most miserable record that has ever been made, IF IN MONEY WE TRUST will try the patience of anyone looking for the joys of \\"Virgo Clowns\\" or for another glimpse of the blush of his muse; or for lines like  \\"You have crossed many waters to be here my love; and will you still be my special rose?\\"<br /><br />MY RETREAT IN VIEW is without any amazing or saving graces.<br />PAGAN HEART is an insult to John Lee Hooker's work.  This really is PSEUDO JAZZ. Have a listen to John Lee Hooker when he duets with Van Morrison on \\"Gloria\\" or \\"I cover The Waterfront\\" to surprise us with the real thing.
B0084I9QLY|5.0|as a club dj who spun this lp the first time around, its a nice addition to my vinyl library
B007M45PMU|5.0|A fun album that lends itself easily to being shuffled with Phillip Phillips and Mumford & Sons on my play list.  HO HEY is what is heard on the radio currently but the other songs are just as good and all have a similar-sound (none of them sound out of place on this play list)
1781164150|5.0|I went with a 5 because of the in depth insight into the making of the film. Like my other art books covering Avatar: The Last Airbender, Iron Man and Stan Winston Studios, I was nonetheless surprised at the work into the film.
006117758X|5.0|Polished as this novel is , its strength lies not in its technical brilliance but in the tight , smooth realism of its detail . A work that cannot be improved upon . Fluid and shamelessly beautiful this  has the imprint of a timeless classic to be  revisited again and again .
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Director did a great job. I watched it twice. I love amy adams homerun trot. I have talked to real scouts and this movie is as close as it gets.
B005I4JG80|5.0|She's smart, funny and interesting. I recommend this book to everyone. I've read the book twice now. Good, practical advice.
0525478817|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. It is what its says on the cover, \\"You laugh, you cry and then you come back for more\\"!! Hands down John Green.  I can't remember reading a book that has made me laugh to myself like an idiot and then pull out a tissue to wipe my tears! Love it!
0810989956|4.0|I liked this book, but I think in my opinion that some of this can be a little inappripropriate for some ages, its really fun to do!
1476712042|5.0|I absolutely loved this book and could not put it down, stayed up until 3am and finished it within a day! I am going back to the start and re-read it all over again.  I cannot wait for the next book, Walking Disaster.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I highly recommend this book!  If you like historical  novels this will be a great addition to your library. I have it on my Kindle but might buy a copy to have on hand to pass around to my friends.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|All I need to say is that this show must go on. Do not cancel. The Arrow is a top notch super hero show with all the trimmings.
0385535147|5.0|Wonderful book, surprise at each turn and ending never expected.,<br /><br />My only wish is that John Grisham were to write a couple of books about the US Constitution and the stories that led to the cases which made our law. He can omit the Court for the last 30 years as it is a political catholic organziation - but the old court are truly worthy of novels and reporting.Josh Sparrow
B0052UYJDC|5.0|A well written, interesting book with lots of great ideas on having less and enjoying life more. It was fun to read the writer's journey into minimalism.
B005LAII08|5.0|Disney is becoming a master of 3-D animation. The effects are very convincing, but not so overdone as to become gimmicky. The story is well-written and the main character is a princess, but not your typical &#34;Disney princess.&#34; She rides horses, is a terrific archer and fights (literally) for her life and the life of her Mother.<br /><br />I won't give you anymore because that would spoil it. Buy this one...it's well worth it. (Don't have a 3-D setup yet? Buy this version anyway. It's got every option covered, 3-D BluRay, regular BluRay, DVD and digital.)
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I just finished this book.  There are many great reviews on here, but I just want to add my weight to the rating.<br /><br />This is a great (and surely new classic) science fiction story.  Ridley Scott bought the film rights:  I just hope he doesn't ruin it (Prometheus was awful!).<br /><br />Pick this one up.  You won't regret it.
1932735410|5.0|Great book for preparation. I am starting studying for the exam and I have been found very usefull ans easy to learn the concepts.
B001F12J0C|5.0|This is a gift.  The ovie has a beryi high rating and we'll just have to wait to see what is thought of it.
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|This product magically stopped working. Not just for me, but for all the folks around me who played. It's really too bad. Essentially a glich occurred where we could no longer guess, only draw. I should have stuck with the free version.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|This was a gift.  We will not know the rating until it is received by the receiver sees it Christmas.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I love angry birds and I haven't played this yet but I for one think its going to be awesome and the best one yet

B006R4H5FG|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read on presentation design and storytelling. Well worth the price and highly recommended.
B005CA4SJW|5.0|This is a gift and has not been reviewed by the recipient.  I'm sure he'll enjoy it when he sees it.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|Thank-you for the prompt shipment of this case. My oldest daughter received a Kindle for Christmas and this case is the perfect compliment. It was in perfect condition and she loves it.
B005LAIIPS|5.0|This was a gift and according to the hype is a superb movie.  We'll just have to see how it is reviewed.
B005LAII08|5.0|great deal great movie. more a mother daughter movie. loved the music background as well. overall a great disney movie.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Michael Connelly never disappoints..His Harry Bosch makes us wish we all had a little of him in us. Thanks again for another great read.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Another great game G5!  One to add to my favorites.  Please continue to make these hidden object adventure games available for my Kindle.  Thank you.
B009DT9ANW|5.0|Peter Frampton and his band are better than ever! I can watch this over and over. One can see how happy he is doing what he loves!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|to have found such a talented writer.<br /><br />\\"I'm so acutely aware of everything about him in this moment that I'm almost positive I could pick his thumbprint out of a lineup.\\" (Location 2039, 38%)<br /><br />I mean, who thinks to write something like that!!? I love that!! And Colleen Hoover is full of those kinds of sentences that you read and you're like \\"holy #@$^. That makes so much sense. How have other people not phrased something like that before?\\" But every word in all of her books are distinctly Colleen. The dialogue she comes up with is so wonderful that reading her characters conversation make me want to hop and skip and dance and I wasn't even drunk.<br /><br />...uuuunnntilll the sad stuff starts. Which I'm kind of..maybe...starting to think that all of her books are going to hit us with wave after wave of utter tragedy that breaks the readers heart.<br />In all honesty, who cares? Reading anything by Colleen, even her freakin' blog posts, ANYONE can tell that this woman was MADE to write. To tell stories. To create such astounding, magnificent, any synonym for wonderful, characters that you fall in love with and want to be best friends with.<br /><br />When I lose myself in a story, I know it's gotta be good. And with Hopeless (as well as Slammed and Point of Retreat) I blinked after reading the last word of the last chapter and realized \\"Well, S@#t, how is it dark outside already? WHAT? I'VE BEEN READING FOR FOUR HOURS!? Oh my, Jebus, I have to pee so bad.\\" (And yes, I curse to myself quite a bit).<br /><br />Another thing I LOVED? The fact that there isn't a big miscommunication that tears the two main characters apart.<br />A love story that doesn't have that? How odd, right?<br />*eye roll*<br /><br />Buy the book.<br />Buy. it.<br />:)<br /><br />(And no more \\"I 'lived' this book!\\" review titles for five star ratings! If you rated it five stars, clearly you LOVED the book. Big diff, guys.)
B009E3EY38|3.0|I just thought it was overrated. Very disappointing. not particularly exiting. The sound just wasn't that great for guys who have been around so long. They seemed bored.
B008H6GH8I|5.0|I'm huge RE fan I own both Degenration and Damnation both great movies. RE Fan will just eat up these movies.
B005IEGUDY|5.0|This book brought to life so much of what I have seen in England, Stonehenge, Cornwall  and The influence of the European continent.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|christmas present for my daughter - can't wait til she finds it in her stocking... all I can hear is I hope Santa brings me &#34;RED!!&#34;

B0017O1MIM|5.0|....excellent restoration to Blu-ray.  The companion book is nice.  A must have for most people.  Trying to meet the minimum word requirement is difficult.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I loved it!  So natural.  No darkness, no lies, just honesty! Brilliant!<br />Can't wait for more from this author soon!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book tugged on every corner of my heart. If you want to experience the emotions of characters while you read, this is the book for you.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|I can watch this over & over, always has been a favorite.  I gave this as a gift and it was a huge hit.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I don't have enough words to describe this novel. Other than BEAUTIFUL, heartbreaking, happy, SHOCKING, and sooo much more! Holder is a mix of all the best male leads like Kellan Kyle, Travis and all those yummy guys you can't help but fall in love with. Sky is everything wonderful and though she discovers who she is and is unsettled at times, she's truly a remarkable herroine. Anyone who's ever been abused or suffered loss can totally relate to her and Holder. And and and! I cannot say enough fantastical, beautiful, awesome things about this novel. COLLEEN HOOVER, you are truly AWESOME ;) and every story you write is better than the last! And that's pretty amazing because the Slammed series was incredible!<br /><br />Liked, loved, LIVED, LOVED LOVED LOVED
B009IJJB8G|4.0|A very good modern take on Holmes. I had my reservations about Lucy Liu as Watson, but she does not disappoint.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Great book, lots of twists and turns and interesting plot going back in time to an old case.  Very interesting how it all comes together at the end...Loved it !
B001G5ZNE6|5.0|easily in the top 5 for best jazz records of all time. this is a must have for any fan of jazz
B005WUHAX8|3.0|I gave it three stars because it's hard to talk when the case is on.  Other than that it's good.
B005QBMZBA|5.0|this is my favorite bill evans record, because it is the only one that i can find that has my favorite song-someday my prince will come, on it.
B003TQKVGU|5.0|Powerful! Get to know the real you. Find out why you think and feel the way you do. Buy this book.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|Excellent movie, Edward Norton is excellent in this movie. It will keep you guessing through the whole movie but in the End it all comes together !
B0083P1QUM|3.0|I think she has lost her way with the Kay Scarpetta character. The last few books in this series have not been up to her original standards.
1419702238|5.0|I bought this book for my nephew because he's building the collection of the set of Diary of a Wimpy kid and he loves them.
B000002MVT|5.0|This CD has some really stellar blues things in Gibbons style.  If you like Billy's playing (and not their stuff from the 80's) this has some great stuff.
B006P4FBUE|5.0|Love this App. You don;t have to know how to play a Piiano. It's great. You can play it as soon as you download it.
B000LPI68W|5.0|Leon is one of my all-time favorite films. It succeeds as an action film but also has a heart-wrenching story. I would recommend that you do not rent this movie; purchase it, as you are sure to want to watch it over and over again.
B009GEBBNQ|3.0|I don't know, seeing all these Marvel characters in one place is kind of cool.  But there just wasn't that much of a \\"wow\\" factor watching it on my computer monitor.  Certainly entertaining, but that's about where it ends.
B000I9U99K|5.0|Every time I watch this film I'm taken from my chair directly to the deck of the H.M.S. Surprise. Russell Crowe gives a superb performance.
B008FSCNTK|1.0|Terrible CD!! They couldn't seem to decide whether it was to be C&W, folk, honky-tonk, or jazz, and they failed on all counts. In my opinion, she hasn't made a good CD since she got married!
B00006674X|5.0|Rececived in a timely manner and in very good condition.  I have an ever growing collection of Elvis movies and this is a great addition.
B005LAIH4A|3.0|I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my daughter so it has not yet been opened and/or watched so I am unable to rate this appropriately until she watches it.
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|if minecraft didn't exist this game wouldn't seem like a cheap knock off. the soundboard is noisy and gets annoying really fast. just get minecraft unless you really are too cheap to spend 6.99
B00008WJBU|5.0|In short without ruining the movie its all the dangerous ways you can test how lucky you are... How far would you be willing to go to prove your lucky?
0345345061|3.0|Be aware, this nice collection of some of J.R.R.T.'s shorter works does NOT--I repeat, does NOT--include his important essay \\"On Fairy-Stories\\" as described.
B000XVSU9O|3.0|Despite the generally good reviews, I found that while it was a very easy read, it  seemed to unreal to me.  Of course, I have never had a near death experience, so take it for what its worth.  Some may find great comfort in it, and for those, I'm happy. For me, it did not quite provide the answers or the comfort I was looking for. The search goes on.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|i like it the pets eyes are soo cute  but needs more game play and my neice loves it too
1451695195|3.0|Nice book, and mildly interesting.  I read it fairly quickly and for the most part, found it a good read.  Every ones mileage may vary. Nice price and fast shipping as always.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|Flown Free requires perseverence and a keen sense of logical and mathimatical reasoning.  it is great for trying to solve a problem or for fun.
B007KW5N9Y|5.0|I was among those who were enchanted by Empire of the Sun upon its release in the mid-80's and could never understand why it was treated so shabbily during the award season. It is possibly Steven Spielberg's finest film - managing to capture a sense of the terror, brutality and despair endured by both the Chinese civilian population and the European internees in China during WWII and the magical-horrific journey of survival of a young British boy amidst it all. Those who have read JG Ballard's semi-autobiographical novel will know that we are presented with a somewhat sanitized version of this story and the scale of the horrors inflicted by the combined effects of the war, the Japanese and the associated famine in China are only really hinted at. Spielberg was perhaps simply not ready to push the limits with EOTS only appearing some 5 years after ET and nearly ten years prior to Schindlers list with Saving Private Ryan, Munich etc still to follow.<br /><br />The provides a snapshot of pre-war Shanghai in the period just prior to Pearl Harbor and then exploresAbove all though the film is about Jim Graham and his physical and emotional journey from being a precocious, over-indulged son of a China-based wool merchant to becoming a hardened, street-savvy, if still precocious, orphan of the war. Christian Bale's rendering of Jim is simply a revelation, beautifully capturing both the terror of loss and abandonment alongside the wide-eyed wonder of a young boy who finds himself amongst and fascinated by the machinery of war. Such horrors as are presented in EOTS are deftly balanced by some wonderful touches of humor mostly derived from Jim's grappling with the adult world and the contradictions/paradoxes of war.<br /><br />This blu-ray release is simply stunning and does a magnificent justice to some of the most incredible cinematic images that Spielberg has captured on film. The near dream-like images of Jim's sheltered world amidst the chaos of Shanghai are wonderful tobehold but are easily eclipsed by the aerial scenes involving the internment camp and the nearby Japanese airfield later in the film. For a mid-80's film the blu-ray picture and sound quality of EOTS makes this purchase/upgrade worth every penny. Enjoy.
B0090EJR1K|2.0|The commercial preview for this movie were the best parts of it.  This is no Borat. I was not expecting this to be great and was not surprised.
B00A2XU9IS|5.0|I have a 3 year old daughter and every morning the first thing she says is, \\"Can we open a window?!\\" it's so exciting for her and I love it too. Such a cute interactive story and I'm very thankful that you are not able to open the windows until the correct day or else my daughter would have them all opened...
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Very funny! Mean girls feel. Also if you like Glee it's a movie for you! I have to get the dvd.
B00701897I|4.0|The Adventures of Tintin is an outstanding movie, and I would give it 5 Stars.<br /><br />It loses a star in my rating because the 3D version was lacking.<br />Nothing that really jumped out at me. After a short while of waiting for something special in the 3D, I just took off the glasses and put in the regular Blu-ray disc.<br />After that I could see that the 3D was adding a bit of depth to the film, but it wasn't worth it.<br />Wearing an extra pair of glasses to watch the film wasn't worth it, and it was just making me tired.<br /><br />Finished the movie without 3D and I was perfectly content. Well, content to finish the movie without 3D, not content in the fact that I was disappointed with what the 3D version was bringing to the table.<br /><br />Great movie!!
B004T2QZL8|3.0|I love this game. It's simply addicting. However, on my Motorola Xoom it crashes regularly, requiring me to shut down my Xoom to fix it. If it doesn't crash outright it stops showing the text, which includes the numbers that track your progress in the game. This is quite frustrating.
B0095VP8D4|5.0|No problems so far. Nothing bad to say really.<br />It was relatively new when I bought it, so limited choices when shopping for a mobo.<br /><br />This was my first build and it went together without a problem. Haven't had much time with it yet.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Ok, I really love my Gerber LMFII knives (yes, I have 2 of them) and I have used those as my primary survival knife whenever I go outdoors.  Well, I've been bugging to get this BK2 for months and finally pulled the trigger.  Let me just say that it's my new primary knife.<br /><br />Here's my comparison of the Gerber LMFII to the BK2 and why I prefer the Ka-Bar:<br /><br />- I like the pointed tip of the back of the handle on the Gerber LMFII, but the flat back of the handle on the BK2 is more practical as a tool.  The Gerber handle would be a sharper weapon and a better glass breaker, but the BK2 flat handle is better for hammering, which is what I would expect to use it more for<br /><br />- Blade thickness on both knives are right about the same, but I think I give a little bit of an advantage to the BK2.  The BK2's blade is larger from edge to spine than the LMFII though<br /><br />- The handles on the BK2 can be replaced.  This gives you options that the LMFII doesn't give you.  While I prefer the more hard rubber texture of the LMFII, I like the size and versatility of the BK2 more.  The diameter of the BK2 handle is a little larger than the LMFII as well, which I preferred more for my larger hands<br /><br />- The sheath on the BK2 is simple but sufficient.  The sheaths on both knives do the job - they hold the knife either upside down or on a belt.  Both have a pinch area on the sheath that holds the knife handle in so you can hang the sheath upside down from your gear, but I like the shape of the BK2's pinch area better.  My thumb naturally goes to the spot where you press against to get the knife to release.  The LMFII is a little more cumbersome to pull out because there's not really a thumb rest area to leverage against.  Also I actually broke one of the pinch tabs off of the sheath of one of my LMFII's which surprised me.  I was forcing it though, trying to &#34;reshape&#34; it so it would be tighter again after getting deformed from an aftermarket paracord wrap that I had put on the LMFII handle.  My own fault.  However, the LMFII sheath wins for functionality though because it does include a built-in knife sharpener that the BK2 doesn't have.<br /><br />I am convinced that a big thick survival knife is very necessary.  It could be your one and only tool to hammer, cut, pry, chop and slice with.  The BK2 and the LMF both have a great blade that has held up very well so I find both still very useful.  This BK2 just feels good in the hand, is very balanced, and the sheath is simple and does the job.  I have it hanging from the shoulder strap on my bail-out bag so it goes everywhere I need it to go.  I love this knife.cord wrap that I had put on the LMFII handle.  My own fault.

B0058Z4NR8|4.0|interesting theories, but not as easy to read as Jared Diamond's Collapse.<br />I'm native spanish speaker, and advanced english reader. This book wasn't easy reading.
B009YU6FJM|5.0|I enjoyed the Deftones previous album Diamond Eyes, but I enjoy more songs from this one.  They shifted back to a grittier collection of songs, with 3 tracks in particular that I have enjoyed over and over.  Great mix of effects, chunky guitar, and the vocal pitch I always expect from the Deftones.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Enjoyed this one most. A love story with a twist.  Usually only read mysteries and thrillers but loved these books.
B005GRTNVE|5.0|Nice and well done show with IL DIVO. These four guys can sing up a storm, and they do it effortlessly and charmingly.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Really enjoyed all of the books.  Didn't know what to expect but glad I picked them up and started reading. Very erotic but not obscene.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|My insight about the American Experience or experiment has been made much clearer by reading this political history of the late 19th Century.
B009X01GJ2|5.0|This is the nicest case for the money that I have seen.  I added an app to keep notes, so it is handy to have on my desk at work as well as at home.  My husband bought one and after I saw it, I bought one.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I started playing this game and it's hard to stop playing. I just got my Kindle Fire HD for my birthday and I'm not a kid. Angry Birds Free was the first game that I got from Amazon. It's alot of fun to play and the longer I play the more I learn how to play the game. I'll be playing this version of Angry Birds for a long time till I get the STAR WARS Angry Birds
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Factual,  no secrets revealed,  Military should not prosecute this guy, since many of Flag and General Officers don't have any Balls, IMHO.  20 yearVet!  Bob
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Keeps me coming back for more and more and more. You have the ability to win prizes as well as loose them over and over. Requires extreme skill or very good luck. Either way, it is simple enough to play.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is the best simplest calculator I have found and it works great on my Kindle Fire HD.  I would recommend this calulator app to anyone looking for a basic calculator.
0811821846|4.0|I purchased this gift for my brother-in-law (though I was tempted to keep it for myself, haha) for Christmas this year. It arrived on time, in great shape, and will certainly be appreciated.
1593272790|5.0|My son keeps watching this book all the time. It helps to create more imagination. I love it, and should have brought much earlier.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I took this to Saudi Arabia when I visited my son.  I had time on my hands; there is little to do in Saudi Arabia. When he would go to work, I read this book daily.  It is long and captivating, so it filled my needs.  This is my first book by this author, only because I do not care for fiction, but since this was based on fact, I found it interesting.
B007EDCWHA|5.0|It was the greatest book in the history of the world . Buy it if your a directioner , remember you're making your future husband richer ;)
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I couldn't put it down.  I enjoyed all of the details of the planning and execution, but it left me wondering why George Bush couldn't have found him, and spared us from two useless costly wars.
B00AB0AXU6|3.0|It's part of the franchise allright...like a carbon was layed underneath for the last three films. The monsters are bigger, I wish the imagination was for the concept. Still entertaining in a shoot em' up zombie sort of way.....the Red Queen did it!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I enjoyed this game very much. I also liked the extras and the bonus adventure.  Thanks G5!  I always prefer their games, and this an excellent example of why.
B009A87X80|4.0|Eva is just exceptional ! Now, I would like to buy her DVD concert available in England but not in France ! I just want<br />Amazon to get it so I can purchase it ! Do something good for your customers..... Please ! I'd like so much to get that DVD.<br />Alain
0739426133|5.0|When you play the first Halo video game you know there is a back story to the whole thing. The Fall of Reach is the back story before the first Halo game. It tells how a young boy was basically kidnapped and genetically altered to become a super soldier known as Spartan 117. After his training the Spartans are badly needed as an alien race called the Covenant attacks Earth's colonies beginning with the planet of Reach. Before long 117 is the lone survivor of the Spartans and he together with the humans must defeat the Covenant or the species is doomed to extinction. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves the games and wants to know how the Master Chief came about.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I have to admit that this game is very addictive, and fun!!!  I can't put the game down once I get started!!
0525952926|5.0|This book accomplished my expectations, it's a great continuation of the saga started with &#34;The Fall of the Giants.&#34; Thrilling, touching, very pleasant to read with details on many historic and political facts.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|This is one of my favorite books and I had preordered the movie after i saw it in theaters. And a few days after it came out on sale I already had the dvd. Amazon's delivery's are fast and very reliable, and I was able to track my order
160094048X|5.0|If my girls could give this book 10 stars, they would. I have made many, many recipes from this cookbook and every single one has been good!! How often can you say that?!?!  The bar cookie recipes are amazing (especially the pecan), the drop cookie recipes are easy, different and delicious (Mexican Chocolate Snickerdoodles - oh yeah).  And for me (a Celiac vegan) - the gluten-free flour recipe provided in the beginning has changed my life - YUM. A gluten-free flour that actually tastes good and works in \\"regular\\" recipes.  And my kids LOVE bringing vegan cookies to parties and having the tray disappear before anything else.<br /><br />Definitely worth buying this little book!
B00005AXKF|5.0|I was surprised to even find this movie as they dont sell it anymore.  I first got one in German by mistake.  I will be buying again and recommend it.
B007ONSLLQ|4.0|I was only familiar with the songs played on the radio, but the rest of the album is no disappointment!!  I appreciate the vocals the most, and am just having trouble getting the files to play anywhere else besides my computer......
B0007KTBIU|5.0|i was really surprised at how many there were to chose from.  I am very happy with my purchase.  I'll be buying again.
1449410243|5.0|I giggled a lot, I must say.  Haven't read it all yet-- saving it for later!!!  Clever and humorous, and amusing graphics.
0545128285|5.0|i love this book for my harry potter collection.  glad I have it. i would definitely recommend it to everyone.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I have had the Kindle Reader for PC and occasionally used it, not very much.<br />I recently received a 7&#34; Android enabled Tablet and downloaded the Kindle Reader for Android.  It is a perfect fit, allowing me to read books in my library easily.<br />The device sync feature has made my reading on my PC's easier to do too!<br />A Home Run Hit for me!
B00632HWOG|3.0|This is a usable app if you have Yahoo mail but there are a lot better apps for mail out there.  It is nice that it notifies you when you get new mail and the notification tells you who its from and the subject which most don't do but it doesn't make up for the simplicity of the rest of the app.
B0041OT9W6|5.0|Confined for two years in a &#34;no exit&#34; apartment with 7 other people make for an accelerated adolescence. Anne has only her diary to help her through a number of teenage milestones.  She was restricted in everyway with only an occasional view of the free blue sky.  Read it with Eli Wiesel's Night and you have a gender-balanced view for teens into the horrors of the Holocaust.
B003UD7JEE|5.0|will watch over and over, I will get season two and three, great acting and nitkita is not bad to look at either
0739378341|5.0|.  I couldn't put it down.  It kept me on the edge of my chair all the time.  There were some issues that I felt were left unanswered but during the last few pages, everything came together!!
B009FZFONO|5.0|I love watching The Walking Dead. This was an outstanding episode too.  Rent or buy - you won't be disappointed!
B009IRVSVQ|4.0|The title says it all really.  Kid has serious talent and seems concerned about making sincere music for his fans.  Gorilla btw is quite an interesting song, while Moonshine remains my favorite.
B001U3Y5XE|5.0|This was purchased as a Christmas gift for my grandson that is totally engrossed in LEGOs. He and his brother and mother have played much since he received it.
B005LAIISA|5.0|I order this for my son for a x-mas present from santa so I have not watched it yet. can't wait to sit down and watch it with him
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|You know those books that leave you with a hangover for days on end? The kind that just bunch you in the gut and leave you as whole new person? Yeah, that's how I'm feeling this morning after reading Hopeless. Hands down the best book I've read all year, and most definitely in my all time favorite top 5 books, EVER. Colleen Hoover amazed me with Slammed and Point of Retreat, and completely solidified her mastermind talents in Hopeless. I can't wait to read more of her books!
B00A757EFW|1.0|Awful. Difficult to mauver pac man. Stick to playing pac man in an arcade or on a game system..way more fun.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Cool but when is the new update it takes for ever for one to come in. Great game buy  the way.
B0017VT5E8|5.0|This movie is just one of those Cinderella movies that make you feel good! Time and time again. The music, the story, the acting, the one liners &#34;Yo Adrian&#34;. All those memorable, timeless moments.
B00AE2LJVS|5.0|I rented this movie not really know what it would be about. It ended up being really good and I watched it a couple times during my rental period. Later I was raving about it to my buddy and when he came over, I rented it again. I really wish I would've just purchased it instead of spending $10 renting it twice (still cheaper I know). I definitely recommend this movie if you're into Moonshining, western-ish type movies or if you just like the actors. I even liked the bad guy.
0446580848|5.0|The book is being given as a Christmas gift..I'm sure it is excellent. My son-in-law  reads this author all the time
0345803507|5.0|We all know how addicting the first two installments were. Well this is a must read to finish the story.
0385535147|5.0|This book is being given as a Christmas gift. However; we know that it will be a very good book. John Grisham always provides excellent reads...
B009NQKPUW|4.0|Really enjoyed the movie, cant wait to see it in 3d on our TV at home! Good story to prequel the Alien series
B007HACDLK|5.0|Typical Vince Flynn novel...Outstanding..Mitch Rapp at his best...Now all we have to do is wait on the next one--soon we hope
1451627289|5.0|What can you say about Stephen King? I love his books. I just finished reading this one and it did not disappoint!
B008YZXYY2|5.0|Well, Corey added some Slipknot to the Stone Sour mix....and this is the first Stone Sour album that I like all the way through.  Very good!
B0063GORYU|5.0|Finally, a solitaire game that I can win once in a while. I love this game and highly recommend it!
B003JBI2KM|4.0|I had heard of this book but decided to sample a few others before I went with it. In the end though, this is the book you want to start with. It wont' give you everything, but it'll get you going in the right direction and you'll be able to patch up your knowledge in the areas that matter to you with other sources.<br /><br />Much of the beer brewing literature is technical and has a decidedly pessimistic tone (as in, if you do this, it's wrong; if you do that, it'll fail; you must do X and Y). Beer is not my first culinary adventure or my first into the world of things that require culturing microbes. If the procedures to make the stuff were so incredibly rigid, we never would have discovered it in the first place. So what I like about Papazian's book is his carefree attitude: just try something, and if it's not perfect, it'll be better the next time.<br /><br />That's basically what you need when you start brewing, and Papazian's book stays decidedly on target.
B0086700CM|5.0|THIS IS AWESOME!!!!!!I LOVE IT make sure u make good choices like going on the wood bridge and try to jump far enough to get over the trees and gaps
B008TMA1LY|4.0|I am a mom of two boys and like to get girly things for myself. This game fits the bill! It fun and easy to learn. Love being able to buy other furniture and decorations for the cafe, or to purchase and upgrade extra workers.
B004J64QSI|5.0|The performance was extraordinary -- especially when the past casts joined in at the end. Even if you are going to see the movie, you should watch this video.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Great updates and suggestions for safety.  The information is spot on accurate.  More people need to use this service .  Thanks.
B006K2WXOI|5.0|A must for anyone with children! Love the pop-up text. Great for a polar express party or a fun Christmas.
B008FSCNTK|4.0|We are fans! Nice sound, good vocals, not quite as enjoyable as some of the earlier albums. Four stars on this one.
B00A6I87UQ|1.0|Obviously the paper version of the Pocket Sky Atlas is a great tool based on the many good reviews here.  The problem is on the Kindle version there is no night mode...it would have been nice to know before purchasing. The star charts are displayed as an image with a brilliant white background.  Not good if you are thinking of using this under the stars.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|G5 did it again! amazingly creepy and engaging. love adventure/HOG games and this is one of the best.played on my KF ...fast download and NO glitches. I highley recommend this game.
B000I9YX06|5.0|one still needs to read asimov, but excellent stand-alone.  sci-fi and truth, a very fine tool to advance critical thinking.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I hated this book.  The story was horrible and the characters were detestible.  You felt for Nick then you felt for Amy, but both are horrible people!
B00AB0AXU6|2.0|Wow... just wow is all I can say, I never thought the Resident Evil movie could turn into such a utter pile of crap, my main issue was with the characters in general. Let's talk about Alice and the deaf kid, (warning there will be spoilers so if you really want to watch this crap then don't read further.) First of all let me start by saying there is no hearing impaired person I know of that can speak that good so that bugged me from the gate, second I don't by the actress cares at all for the kid in the least not to mention there was no character development at all. The kid could have been killed off at any point and I would not have cared less, the sad thing is that goes for every last person in this movie, you just don't care about the characters in the least (at least I couldn't) and I found it hard to get into it because of that. They over used the slow motion early early on in the movie as well and that bugged me. Not to mention the story line was something you would expect from a fourth grader writing a fan fic... just horrid. All in all save you money and don't bother, I mean if you can get if for a buck maybe but if you rent it like I did and pay five then there's a good chance you're going to feel ripped off.
B008Z9YLV2|1.0|Hunger games. Boring, predictable, formulaic, pretentious. I now understand that it was a teen novel, but even considering that it was relentlessly dull.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|The best deal thus far from Amazon ***** the sound of music limited edition Blu-ray DVD set for the low special price was an outstanding bargain. All that was included in the set just the DVD disc elsewhere would have been more thanks Amazon you are Amazing !!
B005GRTNVE|5.0|We are Il Divo fans and we kept reading that Il Divo's concert in London was special. After viewing the DVD, we agree! If you enjoy Il Divo, this DVD will be an excellent additon to your Il Divo collection!
B008S4FZHI|3.0|The plot and storyline were typical Patricia Cornwell but the quality of the ebook reproduction was extremely poor. The text layout including paraphing was often incorrect, making it difficult to follow direct speech interactions and even changes in time sequences. I was disappointed by the overall digital quality especially as it was more expensive than a hard cover version at my local store. This has been my first negative kindle experience, and I hope my last!
B00AMBM9MO|5.0|My husband and I loved it! Good movie, not for kids. Find a sitter.  Not much more to say than that.
B009ZE27US|5.0|Are people really stupid enough to think it scans your real age? The first sentence says it's a prank. LMFAO! Some people need to learn to read!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|One of the better books I've read in awhile.  This is such a PAGE-TURNER ... I'd be up 'til 3-4:00 a.m. reading because it was hard to find a place to stop and put it down.  I don't know HOW these authors come up with these amazing stories - twists, turns, details, story-lines!  This is not a book to miss reading!  Loved it.
B001706I5I|5.0|Although I love the original, this version is still just as good (just a little different) and Jim Carry makes a great Grinch!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Another of Grisham best, enjoyed reading.....I would definitely recommend this book to all readers.  Looking forward to the next one.
074356619X|5.0|Thank you,Thank you, Thank you for this wonderful stuff! Thank you Amazon, Thank you Rhonda Byrne, Thank you The Secret. My life is changing to the better now... I deserved to have great life. Thank you.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|t sounding change just as we experienced with the Beatles, and other groupes who brought their music from England, and Sweeden Great new sound's.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Love the game so far. Great physics, wonderful gravity effects, and some neat powers for the different birds. Haven't moved far enough into the game to really rate it but off to a wonderful start.
B006TLFPKO|4.0|can't wait to see the 2nd part!!!  although, that is what i thought i was buying the other day when i purchased this......
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|The original and great Angry Birds, free is just a bonus. Nothing else but Bejeweled can eat up time at this price point. Love it.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|I just got an email that you processed my order for this movie The Holiday.  I already have this DVD.  Please do not send any more!<br />I like it but one DVD is enough.
B008AUGEFC|4.0|Although I liked how the shipping was quick, the product itself was not in the best condition. It looked like it got wet and the corners were folded and creased a lot. Honestly, I would rather recommend buying it from the store.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|I don't usually like to read books over again, but this is one book, with some wonderful insight into the different paths we take in life with a fantasy twist, that I would gladly read again.
B007EW9ISM|5.0|I bought this for my husband to use.  He has Parkinson's Disease and has trouble using just his fingers.  This works great and has gotten him to use his tablet alot more,
B005EHILV4|5.0|This mixer is awesome, I couldn't get it where I live, so I bought it on Amazon, it works great!! I plugged my Shure mic, and my acoustic electric guitar to the Line In, and also my ipod to the 2track, and everything works great!! Great sound, with the right parameters, you just have to adjust a little here and there, and it will work great, so far no buzz or humm.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Good read well written story I really liked the husband and wife combinations  strong characters and a lot of action
B007HACDLK|5.0|Re: The Last Man by Vince Flynn<br /><br />This is another Great Read from Vince Flynn. His Mitch Rapp Character is another example of what we need in our CIA to keep us safe from the bad guys that Terrorize our World.
0307891372|5.0|I use it regularly.  Material is a good reference for everything skyrim, locations, quests, npc's, etc.  Out of date to some extent now as it doesn't cover Dawnguard or Hearthfire (or the upcoming DLC), but for me it is still a valuable resource.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|One of my favorite superheroes of all time and a perfect way to end the Nolan trilogy, can't wait to see who takes on the throne of batman next
0786962984|5.0|I performed my own comparison review between the new version and the older 1989 version.<br />You can see it here:<br />[...]

B007SY3CEW|5.0|You can play like a pro even if you have never played the piano before.  I have played this game over and over..just can't get enough of playing the piano..and you are graded according to how well you play. You have the chance to play the songs over and over to get a better grade..you will love this game..
B005LAII1C|5.0|Loved it when it came out in theatres and the unrated version just got better and better watched a thousand times already!!

B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Need more coins so can get further faster.so can get to next level.but as is still a fun game.doze it and have fun.
B008AT71WI|5.0|I don't often buy dvd's, blu-ray or otherwise, but when I do I buy the best. So when it came to the Little Shop of Horrors, I bought the director's cut with the awesome black ending. Buy it, you will be horrified you did!
B002EDH0FE|4.0|Sufficient action, well-acted and forthright direction. The graphic novel does not always play out well in the a/v genre...the director had a challenging task and delivered.
B00ACBN9CI|3.0|I play this game on a Kindle Fire and it runs very well on this device. I would like to have more controls that a pilot would have to manipulate to make the game more realistic. As it is (and I've just began playing it) it seems too basic, when flying the jet. The graphics a pretty good, with great shading and smoothness. I would recommend this as it is fun, entertaining and fairly difficult to be good at playing it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|this game is a lot of fun and easy to use. it is very stable and challenging but also balanced
B009LK6JS2|4.0|Nice simulation of flying an F/A-18 Hornet. I recommend it.  Don't get frustrated by it...flying an F/A-18 is suppose to be difficult.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Finished the new Colleen Hoover book \\"hopeless\\" at around 1:30 this morning ... It was fantastic!<br /><br />Just past half way I literally said out loud \\" oh s***\\" and had to read the sentence again....then had to finish.<br /><br />Colleen, you are 3 for 3! Another amazing story!
B003YL4LYI|3.0|The story is moving in circles and there are too many loose ends. I don't relish reading another 1,000 pages just to find out the story doesn't make sense. The last two books were gravely disappointing.  I didn't heed the reviews and purchased the book anyway. I regret that decision.
B00005LC1H|5.0|This is absolutely the wittiest...funniest...most brilliant comedy ever presented to the world...it's a must buy for those that enjoy a good laugh.

B00A80SHFM|5.0|I have loved Les Miserables (translates into English as Those Miseries) ever since I was a small child and saw Animaniacs spoof Those Miseries in a segment involving Rita and Runt, those silly drunks. Ergo, I knew I just had to purchase this brilliant CD although I could have just bought select songs from iTunes. However, I have just come back from Wal-Mart, which stayed open long enough so that I could be the first person on my block to own it. I listened to it on my Sony Discman as I was hitchhiking home this early morning, and man, am I ever so happy that I spent money that my future children will have to pay on this CD.<br /><br />What makes These Miseries so compelling and stirring, of course, is that it is an opera that chronicles the rise and fall of the popularity of the French kiss in 18th-century France, a story that, admittedly, has seen numerous incarnations throughout the decades, simply because a lot of people enjoy the sensual eroticism of French-kissing. I find that the score of this CD is fittingly sexy and, might I say, even a little bit naughty, to boot!<br /><br />Take the first two tracks by that New Zealander, Hugh Jackman. Both are filled with hot, spicy Latino dance beats and passion that just make me come...apart at the seams, that is. It is almost like I can literally...literally feel the amore oozing out of my Sony Discman ear buds and right into my inner ear canal. Caliente! Caliente, senorita! Even the songs by Annie Hathaway--whom we all know and respect because of her Italian boyfriend troubles (he ended up being a criminal who got caught by the law)--are pretty good, but they are naturally not as classic and praiseworthy as songs by Ke$ha, Lady Gaga or William Hung. After all, Hathaway is just an actress and not a singer, too, yet she still gives it her all, which should be commended, but only a little bit, just to be polite.<br /><br />Another highlight is the singing voice of Russell Crowe. I was pleasantly titillated to figure out that I was listening to his manly, manly voice coming through my Sony Discman ear buds. I do wonder if he has stepped away from his anti-Americanism and the fugly incident with the hotel clerk some years back in New York. I guess he must have, for he is singing his little, Kiwi heart out on this disc, and it sounds positively supple, just like his awesome Kiwi accent.<br /><br />In short, purchase this Those Miseries CD; I promise you that you will not be disappointed. If you are, I will personally give you a refund. I am a man of compassion, which is why I realize that you likely have little money in these years of the Obama presidency; after all, the unemployment rate, counting underemployed people, is like 17%. However, do steel yourself and throw caution to the wind by purchasing this CD. I guarantee that you will at least be able to use it as a nice-looking coaster.

B0076DEJMO|5.0|Red Country is a standalone novel taking place on the same world as Joe Abercrombie's five other novels (the First Law trilogy, Best Served Cold, and the Heroes).  Although the novel truly can standalone, there are a lot of references to the other novels and some of the plot twists will be less meaningful if you begin with Red Country rather than the others.  So if you're interested in Red Country, you should start, instead, with the Blade Itself, the first book of the First Law trilogy.  I should note that Red Country, like every Abercrombie novel, is bloody and contains a lot of foul language.  There's also a little bit of sex.  If these things offend you, you probably shouldn't read any of his books.<br /><br />Red Country is a western fantasy.  It tells the tale of Shy South, a farmer with a criminal past, as she pursues men who kidnapped her brother and sister.  She is accompanied at first by her step-father, Lamb, an apparently cowardly Northerner, and later joins up with a group of travelers all heading in the same direction across the desert.  The cast of characters grows to include Dab Sweet, a famed scout, and his Ghost partner (a \\"Ghost\\" is the analog of a Native American in this story), Savian, a Rebel in hiding, and Temple, fleeing a mercenary troop.  Also involved is Nicomo Cosca, who played roles in several other Abercrombie books, as he is hired by the Inquisition to hunt down Rebels.  The story also features a couple other characters from previous Abercrombie books.<br /><br />Red Country is the sixth Abercrombie book that I have read and it is by far my favorite.  Its predecessors were mostly solid four-star books (with the Heroes being a decent three-star effort).  But Red Country highlights Abercrombie's strengths and cleans up his weaknesses.  As in his previous novels, Red Country features an excellent, fascinating cast of characters who are developed brilliantly.  Shy is one of the best characters that I've ever encountered.  She's a wonderfulexample of how to develop a strong female character in a genre normally dominated by male authors and male protagonists.  Lamb, although his background is apparent to anyone who has read the previous Abercrombie novels, is very well drawn and his dialogue with Shy is fantastic - realistic and often very funny.  Although Temple's character arc was predictable as they come, he provided some of the best moments in the novel.  The side characters, such as Sweet and Savian, the Mayor and Papa Ring, are also well-developed, have interesting motives, and play realistic, entertaining roles.  Even someone like Nicomo Cosca, who I have not cared for in previous Abercrombie novels, is developed spectacularly.<br /><br />Further, Abercrombie has mastered action scenes.  Be it the fighting scenes - dirty, desperate, vicious battles - or chase scenes -breathless, exhilarating, or tense standoffs - the calm before the storm.  Abercrombie has always done action well, but he's really taken it to a new level with Red Country.  The dialogue is, as usual for Abercrombie, very good (although he strays towards over-the-top action film type dialogue).  There's a lot of humor in Red Country, typically through sarcasm, but also through funny situations.  Abercrombie also manages to blend in some truly poignant, moving moments.  While previous Abercrombie novels were fun action pulp with minimal substance, Red Country has a lot more going on beneath the surface.<br />I outlined the story above, but I would just like to add that the story was gripping from the start.  I enjoy the rare novel these days that doesn't involve enormous, cataclysmic, apocalyptic consequences.  Instead, we have a story of a young woman who just wants to save her brother and sister.  It's the biggest story in the world to her, but in the grand scheme of things it's just one small tale.  One thing that always frustrated me about fantasy novels is the apparent need of the authors to make every book a battle for the world.  There are a lot of fascinating things that happen to regular people that doesn't require an apocalypse-type event.<br /><br />Red Country is by no means a perfect novel.  There are a couple of inconsistencies (for instance, one of the characters is alternatively described as having three or four fingers on one hand, depending on which chapter you're reading).  Further, the novel was, for the most part, pretty predictable.  I've always found Abercrombie's books to be predictable, and at least I can say that Red Country was the first of his novels to provide any sort of surprise.  But the big plot twists were all pretty easy to see coming.<br /><br />Red Country deserves a 4.5 out of 5 but since Amazon doesn't permit half star reviews, it gets a well-deserved 5.  I can't remember the last time I was so thoroughly entertained by a book.  Although, as I mentioned, you should read Abercrombie's other books first (and they're all worth your time), Red Country is really special.

1439102430|1.0|This is the worst book I have read by Kathy Reichs.  I usually look forward to learning something about her work, the location or setting of the mystery and how the events discovered fill in the blanks.  Two police officers  - former lovers - have little to contribute except for snide and sarcastic comments about each other.  Just gave it up as a bad choice - I expected more from an established writer who has created page turners in the past.  Skip BONES ARE FOREVER and hope her writing has a focus if she writes another.
B0001ARCFA|2.0|I have worked in Radio and occasional music mixing throughout the years. The classic AKG design was found everywhere- radio stations, studios, on location, at home. This model, (at least one of its variants) was a fine sounding, highly respected standard in the industry(ies). Evidently, those models were made in Austria.<br /> I was hoping the now much cheaper Chinese version was basically the same except for lower labor costs being passed on, and a couple fewer accessories in the box. Nothing could be further from the truth. These are not an exceptionally good value at $66.00, let alone the $160 suggested. I don't know if they skimped on the drivers, or what's different, but these are cold, analytical, no extension at either extreme, OK midrange, fair soundstage with some detail. But poor dynamic range. They are just no fun for work OR play.  I'm baffled at the great reviews, UNLESS, like I'm thinking, this is a different animal then the model masquerading in the reviews starting sometime in 2011. If you notice, most of the fair to poor reviews were done in 2011 and later. That's when something changed. Look at the various Audio Technica, the cheaper Senns, Sonys,or Grados for under $100. ALL will beat these handily AND get your feet tapping. Use these maybe for shortwave radio?<br /><br />So- my best deduction- something happened on the way to China.....
1451620829|2.0|I expected some insights into the band's origin, rise or mechanisms, but very little time spend on anything real in between the whiny baby pouts.  A pretty honest account, but drones endlessly about \\"Gene treated me bad\\" here and \\"Paul didn't like me\\" there, all while he's treating those that love him even worse.  I feel so bad for the whiny multi-millionaire who endlessly calls himself the \\"Spoiler.\\"  Puh-leeze.  Hard read with little enjoyment from a narcissistic victim.

I have to say, I found it was a bit too &#34;out there&#34; even for a book set in the future, especially compared to the first two books in the trilogy.

He doesn't just wield steel, he is a warrior's steel.<br />He lives, he loves, he slays and he is content. He lives free in the world. A free Man, he is ruled by no one.<br />Jason Momoa embodied Conan completely.<br /><br />The scenes with Tamara (Rachel Nichols) were priceless. She arrogantly thought she could tell Conan what to do and how to do it.  Thinking she could just say \\"I'm going if you want to help, you have to come along\\" In response Conan tied her up. Even tied up she wouldn't shut up. Trying to demand he untie her. Conan just put a piece of cloth in her mouth said \\"QUIET\\"<br /><br />Long Live Conan

B0057UA486|5.0|Kubrick was a master of film making.  He knew how to get the most out of whatever he was doing. This movie is by no means a technical affair (as &#34;2001...&#34; was) and not nearly as violent as &#34;A Clockwork Orange&#34;, nor was it a &#34;black comedy&#34; like &#34;Dr. Strangelove...&#34; was. BUT... -it was a very well done &#34;historical&#34; period movie. He filmed all the low light scenes with specially built cameras, and though the story may not be interesting to some -I found it very compelling.  This is not an &#34;excitement&#34; movie. You aren't going to be holding on to the arm rests or on the edge of your seat but he relates the story very well.  I recommend this to those who love his movies and anyone who enjoys high quality films.
B000FC2KL0|5.0|Wow, what else can I say? You know the life of a rock star has to be intriguing, but he has so much depth to his soul and his story is surprisingly relatable in so many ways. I'd recommend this book to anyone who's ever experienced addiction even if you're not a Red Hot Chili Peppers fan.

1440503257|5.0|A REALLY fun book. Purchased for a serious Harry Potter fan who doubles as a household chef and she absolutely loves it! Very true to form in terms of Harry Potter themed recipes, offers great detailed instructions in the recipes, and explains the connection of each recipe to the books! A lot of the recipes are just european dishes with a Harry Potter twist and The only complaint I had was a lack of pictures for each dish, so if you've never heard of it you aren't sure what it is!
B005LAII12|1.0|NEVER BUY THIS MOVIE WITH ANY KIDS - THE STATEMENTS ARE VERY BAD FOR KIDS TO HEAR AND SEE.<br />Also - it is more for Christmas than any other religion. Save money - don't buy it or send it to yourself or a friend.<br />This is my opinion and a friend of me too.
B00000IZOR|5.0|You wouldn't know that by the name of the product, but I can assure you that it does and is both! If I hadn't had one of these as a kid, I would never have known how to use a real phone. Thank you, Fisher-Price, for the years of confident telecommunication! I couldn't have done it without you, and now I know my baby will have the same confidence.<br /><br />(Fisher-Price, is there any chance you'll develop a chatter fax machine in the future? I think kids may need to catch up with the tech of this century at some point.)<br />But seriously, love this toy. It very much reminds me of the one I had as a child. It's durable, with rounded edges for your clumsy toddler's safety :)

B009GX7IRA|4.0|Parts of it can be hokey and unrealistic, yes.  But it's a fictional TV show.  An escape.  Aside from McGee's weird voice change this season, it was very entertaining.

During his adventures, Jannon runs into some pretty extraordinary people. Luckily, Jannon is smart enough to recruit these unlikely players in solving an extraordinary puzzle. Of course, there is a secret society that doesn't necessarily want that to happen any time soon...<br /><br />This book was reminiscent of Ready Player One by Ernest Cline, but for book nerds instead of gamers. There were many references to pop culture icons such as Google and the book had instances where you felt like you were \\"in on the joke.\\" Sloan's writing made me feel like I was listening to a friend tell an amazing story. It really is a gem.<br /><br />The characters in this world were engaging and I found myself really invested in finding out what happened to them. And I really didn't expect the places this book would go, but it was a wonderful surprise!  Another awesome surprise? The cover of Mr. Penumbra's 24 Hour Bookstore GLOWS IN THE DARK!<br /><br />5 stars to Mr. Penumbra's 24 Hour Bookstore for being a wonderful and fun read

B00A80SHFM|4.0|The film version is a totally separate thing from the stage version.  That said, I'm disappointed in \\"Master of the House,\\" not so much because of the singing, but because I prefer the full on, loud, boistruous, more orchestral version.  It comes down to preference:  I love Hugh Jackman, but Colm Wilkinson will always be my Valjean.  (It's a treat that Colm is the Bishop in the film).  Amanda Seyfried's vibrato drives me bonkers.  Eddie Redmayne does well, but Michael Ball is the ultimate Marius.  Samantha Barks is superb; Anne Hathaway is devastatingly touching.  Russell Crowe is a disappointment, but nowhere near the train wreck others have said he is.  If you keep in mind it's a highlights album for the non-hardcore Les Mis fan, it's just fine and worth adding to your collection.

B0091LS07E|5.0|Well Licia says she got her locks changed.  I was very optimistic when I first saw the commercial featuring Girl On Fire!  Eventually, they ran it so much it became slightly annoying but I didn't let that keep me from being openminded.  I am glad I kept it in perspective because I am pleasantly surprised; especially, after her personal life appeared to take priority.  I am glad that she was able to channel all the energy and publicity into a worthy collection of songs that represent a turning point in her career.  Brand New Me, Fire We Make, Not Even The King & Limitless were the strongest tracks.  There were some vocal strains and the soft spoken tunes were at times difficult to understand and in someways appear like rambling.  On 101. that tirade at the end was aweful and I guess was her attempt to stretch beyond her range or show growth but it was not a complement. I am however able to look beyond that single flaw in my rating of 4.5 and will round up to a 5 star rating.  The duo with Maxwell was the best complement for the project as well as, two appearances by Emeli Sande, it was an asset for them as their styles and voices meshed.<br />In addition,  her son is quite special and I wish her and her new family all the best.  This is definitely a Great Start.

B001DBOBDW|5.0|Every song on this CD makes me want to move. It's my new house cleaning music. Such a funky, bluesy treat!
B00A757EFW|5.0|I had fun in the first few minutes. I remember playing Pac-Man along time ago. I loved it then and love it now. Runs smoothly &amp; makes laugh. My grandchildren wil love this also. Thanks for bringing it back. Makes me feel young again!!!
B008DM4OTA|5.0|this game is perfect for my 3 year old, yes it is repetitive, but he likes that.  it keeps him still when i need him to be.  its awesome
B0063IH60K|5.0|solitaire, great fun, enjoy playing, game is easy to use, wish it was as easy to get my nook books downloaded
B008MF3OEY|5.0|This cover is totally stunning. You think it looks good in the picture? It's even better for real. As other reviewers have noted, it isn't a completely secure cover, in that it doesn't click closed or anything. But if you treat your Kindle well and don't throw it around, this should be plenty secure fir average use. I love it!
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|I think this app freezes to often but it is still fun to play as long as ot rodent freeses
B006JSXYPA|5.0|This movie looks just as good at home as it did in theater.  A must for anyone into any generation of transformers
0007170874|4.0|Really enjoyed this book by a great man, too bad everyone who has taken over IBM has not been as inspirational or visionary. Guess cost cutting has gone wild & IBM is no longer needed to be a leader in anything other than shipping work overseas to bad service. A good read if you're interested in how a sub average company became great by great leadership who was truly interested in the business & cultural change rather than just costs
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Good story.  It doesn't seem to have many unconnected stories that tie together near the end of the book like the usual Clancy books.  This may be an effect of the co-author, but it's still a very good story.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|like it reat season, if you havent seen it you must must must must must must. I am zombie crazy!!!
B000FBFMZ2|3.0|Is there a science fiction writer out there who doesn't have a political ax to grind? Maybe it's the speculation about the future of humanity that forces them to drive some of their personal views miles into left field, but really, do you think that 100's of years from now they will be saying things that could be stripped from the Huffington post op. ed. pages?<br /><br />Yes we get it already, you hate religion and the religious, and you feel the individual rights are subject to the state (unless of course, it's you/your character's rights). Is it possible to write a book without forcing those hatreds down our throats?  Or do all authors feel that we're all 'morons like that, swallowing belief patterns whole', and have to be reminded of their enlightened political view whenever we do some recreational reading?<br /><br />As mentioned in the review's title, this book is clearly from a skilled writer--nice atmosphere, great pacing, no wasted exposition or slow description.  But he preserves his most hostile language of the whole book for the future Catholics of earth, using the main characters to provide some particularly barbed comments, and in the end celebrates the UN deciding to deny them the right to stay dead when they pass away. No, I'm not catholic myself, but the hatred of 'the opiate of the masses' and the reverence of the state is just to aligned with current political viewpoints to be fitting for an earth that's 300+ years away. I guess it's great if you don't get enough vitriol from today's political pundits, but for me, it seemed anachronistic.  All of this technology advancement, all of this socio-economic upheaval from the colonization of space, and yet for their political views, they refer to something that could have come from a 20th century issue of \\"The New Worker\\"? Call me a pattern-swallowing moron, but I'm getting tired of it.<br /><br />Is there a sci-fi writer out there that can separate his political views from his stories?
0525478817|3.0|I was hesitant to read this book due to it's dark nature but after seeing the great reviews I decided to go for it. I was hoping to be pleasantly surprised but I was not. I even bought this book as a gift  for someone before I read it. Oops- now I have to explain why I'm giving such a depressing story as a \\"gift\\"
B0061QD88S|5.0|I saw this in my own childhood and loved it and I still do at 59!!!!!  I am getting it because my grand children love it and I want a copy of it in my home so they can watch it....it is so sweet, no real violence, a real family movie!!!!!  My 3 yr old and 1 yr old grand daughters watch it and are mesmerized by it!
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I like that you can either view or download videos with this App.  I download about 10 good songs to my Video Library to watch when I'm off line.  Or if you want to save space you can download it as am MP3.  I've recommended to all family members with Androids and everybody gives it a thumbs up.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|We love Les Miserables anyway and this DVD is the ultimate for the music.  They did a very good job of moving the play to the concert stage.
B005LAIH4A|4.0|Cute movie. I could see some large undertones (maybe over tones) of paralleling Money hungry greedy business vs. environmentalists to an extreme, but the message isn't off.  Let's not get ridiculous here and start selling air!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|The story line kept me engaged and looking forward to bedtime which is mostly the time that I read. I would recommend it.
1435122968|5.0|Alas, this volume is not complete.  It is missing one story, &#34;In the Walls of Eryx.&#34;  Admittedly his only attempt at true science fiction, it is not needed for this collection of weird fiction.  I don't feel that this little problem is worth the loss of one star.  The product itself if beautifully done.  A solid addition to any HPL collection.<br />Also there is supposed to be a biography at the end of the volume.  My copy is missing this.  Still I am pleased with the purchase since I have over 200 books on HPL and later writers.  I am well versed in his life.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great writing!  It was a quick and easy read.  I recommend it to both men and women of all ages!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Excellent read. As riveting as hunger games. Suggest u read it if u liked the movie or the first book.
B004YXE438|5.0|I really like this app - especially that you can use your own images. That aspect really expands the options.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Love having facebook on my kindle. So easy to use and would recommend this app to anyone who enjoys facebook.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|The Avatar 3d blu ray came fast and works just like it should. I would gladly buy again. Very happy

B003Y5H5B0|5.0|i had no trouble at all receiving my purchase. it arrived on time and was exactly what i was looking for. the quality was great.
0547884591|4.0|for the price and the amount of content and entertainment you get, it's a no-brainer. however, if you are looking to become a pro chef, please understand that no amount of \\"hacking\\" can create experience or wisdom. cooking well involves experiencing cooking using all your more-than-5 senses, becoming open, creative and playful in your approach to food, and just plain cooking lots of different foods.<br /><br />the book reads like a series of blogs, articles, etc... like a glossy magazine: this is good, and entertains the eye. great design sense, which makes the huge page count very approachable.<br />this is by far the best of tim's 3 books, and i'd recommend any newbie to the ferriss-model to start with this book, and move backwards.<br /><br />regardless of the weird vortex of hype (and hyperbole) surrounding tim's approach to life, the 4 hour chef contains a lot of neat and useful tricks to use in a variety of kitchen and non-kitchen settings. like any good philosophy, behaviors in one area are applicable in other seemingly disparate areas.<br /><br />the main issue i have with tim is probably also why he is so successful - his eagerness to impress others and have others like him. many times the book comes across in a kind of \\"look what i just did while i pat myself on the back\\" sort of way, but luckily and skillfully (either tim has figured this out about himself or he has a great editor) it always veers back to skill-building and learning.<br /><br />read the book, use the tips, learn how to learn and PLEASE, don't guru-ify people who aim to help you.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is awesome because the diary of a wimpy kid books are really cool and funny. I also like that the pictures are nicely detailed and silly. If you like funny books this is the book for you !!!!!!!!!!!!
B000YHG72E|5.0|This film is both funny and endearing. It's destined to be a classic for many many years to come. Great for kids and adults. A rare combination.  Enjoy!
B009DTI3FS|5.0|I really loved it.I have about five versions of La Boheme and found this a nice change in the presentation.The setting and use of modern day venues working .The singing of course is where it all hapoens and with Anna Netrebko as Mimi how could one go wrong.If you are as I am a fan of Puccini and Netrebko then I say buy it.This the type of change Callas said needed to be done to productions so it isn't just he same old production over and over again.
B005LAIH4A|3.0|the litmus test was my 5yo son, was amused, not terribly entertained. and, the moral of big business vs conservation was a little advanced for his age
B004J4WLPU|5.0|Once I started this book, I couldn't stop reading. It is truly a wonderful novel, well written!  I would highly recommend.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I rarely write reviews for books because in all honesty I am lazy. I must for this book because it was incredible. I bought it at around 2pm and finished it at 12am. It was so worth it and I recommended it. She is just an incredible author.

B009MF56GC|4.0|could not use digital copy not for use out side of  states. had to chase up muliti region player but was worth it.
098555780X|5.0|This book was extremely helpful. My husband loved it and has made almost everything in this book. Very detailed item.
B008H6GHL0|3.0|Good RE movie better that those pos versions made here in the US.<br />I took off a star because Rebeca Chambers was not in it.<br />And another because I am getting relay, relay tired of Leon.

B007MDQW3W|5.0|Fresh new songs from Regina Spektor.  Love every single song on this CD!  If you're a fan, add it to your collection....and then see her live in concert...AMAZING!!
B009NPA3MS|5.0|Hey, I am fan from his Idol performances. My husband doesn't like this album as much as I do but I would recommend it.
B00APUYWYA|1.0|I love glee, it's usualy fresh, on the mark with its songs/danceign, but this piece of TRASH comes nowhere close to their sometimes flaky standard.<br /><br />Incoherent script, no chorigraphy, lame singing--I'm angry-- the studio exec who ok'ed this gross insult to musical drama/comedy shoud be lowered forceably onto a sharpened telephone pole set in the ground and be left to squirm!
B009KHDT0C|5.0|I am a huge fan of the original and appreciate the films devotion towards pulling small but amazing accurate touches from the TV show. Particularly Michelle Pfieffer's performance and costuming....AMAZINGLY true to original! Quirky brilliant performances by the cast and one love scene had me laughing until tears rolled down my face. Love this movie!!!! I highly recommend it.

B004GBIE3Y|5.0|A humorous but also serious look at a sensitive issue, teens and adults who suffer from depression and other mental health issues. Loved it.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|I only started playing this game to gain stars for tap zoo. Supposedly if I get to level 4 I'd get some stars. Well I played till level 35 and nothing! So I uninstalled and reinstalled and played till level 5 ....nothing again! This game sucks!
B0085RQLXK|4.0|The short version:  if you're looking for your first Aerosmith experience, don't get this; get &#34;Aerosmith's Greatest Hits&#34; from the 1970s and, above all, &#34;Pump.&#34;  If you're already even a moderate fan, though, this is well worth adding to your collection.<br /><br />Expectations were high for their first album of original material for more than a decade (though Honkin' on Bobo was more than filler).  I wouldn't say &#34;Music from Another Dimension&#34; lives up to the anticipation, but what could?  In the face of haters who think old guys can't rock, I tell you:  the band sounds fantastic.<br /><br />About half the songs--mostly the uptempo ones like &#34;Legendary Child&#34; and &#34;Lover Alot&#34;--are good loud fun in the tradition of my favorites from &#34;Just Push Play.&#34;  The ballads are fine but won't be in constant repeat in my playlist. There is one brilliant song whose many facets deserve a lot of attention:  &#34;Street Jesus.&#34;  But, on the other hand, I listened to &#34;Can't Stop Lovin' You&#34; with Carrie Underwood so you don't have to.  Call it an &#34;American Idol&#34; hangover.<br /><br />I saw Aerosmith live at Madison Square Garden about ten days after the album was released--they were terrific, but their setlist surprised me by sticking mostly to classics and not heavily profiling the new album.  It made me wonder if they also knew it wasn't their strongest work.  But one level down from their very best is still pretty darn good.
B0099114WO|5.0|Great
B00A757EFW|3.0|Love pacman. It was the first game I played. The game is just like it has always been, except now with super stiff controls. While it is nice to have Pacman on the go, I'll stick with my original copy for NES.
0545157617|5.0|My kids picked this book and I had no idea what to expect. It had a great meaning of family and perservence. I wasn't expecting to like it as much as I did and I was really rooting for stick man, no pun intended.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|just like everyone else...newsfeed not working and then yesterday..it wouldn't let me &quot;like&quot; anything. agree with all others  why is it taking so long to fix?
B0045IZW9W|5.0|This group is really great.  Their beats are so fresh, I can't help but groove when I hear them.  Ninja and Yolandi's lyrics are always great, sometimes funny, sometimes more serious, but always awesome and spot on with DJ Hi-Tek's beats.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Awsomeness serisoly awsom awsom awsomeness love this game. If you guys can find more words to call this gsme plead tell me
B008673ZAQ|5.0|What a fantastic follow up to Bared to You!  Gideon is still hotter than hot of course.  Can't wait to read the next book in the series.
B009LA1R34|5.0|I liked all but a couple of the songs on the CD.  It was well done and I enjoyed the music.
1419701533|5.0|Granddaughter loves these books. She is 10 years old.<br />Great birthday/Christmas gifts for your favorite not-so-whimpy kid.<br />We bought the whole set of 5 books.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Can be played by elementary children to teach logic but adults can enjoy the larger challenges.  I also enjoy Bridges also by Big Duck Games.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I have a different problem with this app.  Every time I try to write a comment (or type anything) it auto-corrects everything!  It will not allow acronyms, for example.  Kindle says it is not their problem and Facebook will not respond.  This is awful!!!  Also, there is NO provision for an override.  I've never seen an auto-correct that didn't provide an override.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|It's just kinda boring. Mr. Renner does a nice job, but the movie sorta drags. The plot needed to be more involved and surprising. It's not a bad movie though.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Like the game very much! I've played a few games by the &quot;designer&quot; and they all have been intriguing.  Would definitely purchase others. Can't wait for more.
B003NFM3JK|5.0|I've seen all the remakes of this movie and I gotta tell ya this is so unique, I didn't know it would be so good and it go a thumbs up from my 4 and 8 year olds as well as us oldies. The story is the same principle but the little special magic put into the mix makes it one to watch over and over again.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|love usingn  this interface. it's just like you are on your computer. handy when looking for a certain file to access.
B005IQZB14|5.0|what an amazing journey!  Very well written.  It was suggested by a friend and I'm glad I took her up on it!  I would rate more things if I didn't have to write something, and really if I didn't have to use so many words... that's how good this book is.
B000BVMAJ2|3.0|got for son for his birthday. he loved it and that was  the important thing. I think it was  bit overpriced for what you get, but in the end his joy is what matters.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|I just wanted to play an occasional game and all it wants to do is<br />SELL something.  I deleted it.

B0039TD7RC|4.0|The person who received this had been wanting it a very long time. He loves disc 1 but really dislikes disc two. He is most def not a happy camper with this CD of the strolling bones, I mean Rolling stones.
B003LPV960|4.0|Love this movie. Emma Thompson is fantastic & so is the rest of the cast. Color of the Blu Ray was disappointing though. Too yellowish green overall.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I've played the desktop version (and laptop) of Spider solitaire quite a bit and was very happy to see it for my new Kindle. It plays just like the &#34;bigger&#34; version and gave me lots of enjoyment when I should have been doing something more productive.  But that's the way it is with computer games.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book deserves to be on the top ten best list.<br />Great surprise half way through. A pleasure to read.
B007XNAOS0|5.0|On this supposedly last day of planet earth according to certain interpretations (21-12-2012), it's time to open up to a friendly voice, a kind of a softer voice than the one in Metallica on the \\"unforgiven\\" mode.<br /><br />(By the way I still like \\"Enter Sandman\\" a copy of Slayer's \\"In-a-gadda-da-vida\\" or vice versa?)<br /><br />The voice of doom, a death metal clich&eacute;. remember Lord Humungus as heard in the movie Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior(1981),the thunder of anger and aggression, the blasts of machine guns, the shouts of \\"Kil Kill\\" can yield to a warm tone singing \\"love love\\".<br /><br />The cult of ugly can stand by the side of the cult of beauty knowing that the best for one is the worst for another; categories should be used to compare not to condemn. \\"Green Home\\" is gorgeous, \\"March to the sea\\"and \\"The line between\\"<br />wallop along with peacefull interludes in remembrance of Nirvana. Quoting Linda Leseman from The Village Voice: Yellow and Green \\"trancends metal,venturing into folk and psychedelic spaces.\\"<br /><br />Please check out two french metal bands, Gojira: L'enfant sauvage and Alceste: Les voyages de l'âme for a similar taste.<br />Suppose you have a soul and you lock into it, then suppose you're alone in a crazy and brutal world. Choose your vision.<br />Yellow for the light of the sun; green for the radiance of life. Not yellow and green for the color of vomit... Be propelled into a happy state instead of one of obliteration.
B0085Z3B2Q|5.0|Just the same as described in the summary of it and had very qucik shipment.  Recommend to anyone to use.
B005VPRDAY|5.0|The lego bin arrived fast, and was in very good condition! My daughter will be filled with joy when she opens this x-mas gift! Thank you so much!
B00A757EFW|5.0|it looks like a great game to play on my kindle and it is and its enjoyable for all ages and I think its supper fun for everyone!  ={)
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love this game for all of the cute baby dragons. They're not as cute when they are adults, but that's okay. If you can't afford any of the really cool dragons, try cross-breeding two different dragons to get a really cool dragon. It's best to download this game now, because every thing is Christmas-y and covered in snow. Hint: go ahead and buy all four food farms. You may think you won't need all of them , but four is better than 1,2, or 3.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Odd, eerie, charming and strange - The kindle edition sadly does not reproduce the photos well and they really are part of the story.  I enjoyed it in spite of this handicap though
B009JBZH54|5.0|This Trilogy makes it hard to imagine Batman movies without Nolan behind the camera.  So very happy with my purchase:)
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Absolutely amazing! Finished this book in 9 hours literally could not put it down to even eat I HAD to know what was next! The end left me wanting more to see the rest of Hudson's secrets to know if they get married have kids what life will be like if they have children, because let's be honest they are messed up. I think they will make it through though be caused they are messed up in a perfect way... I could go on for hours but seriously you have to read this!
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|This is a great movie! Very fun for a night in with the family. Now we want to see the 3d
B008J34466|4.0|As expected.  New item.  I don't love all the songs, but basically a good album if you're a Pink fan.
B00AQ71FLK|2.0|I have the original order and chaos and this is far from it . its not bad but it sure isn't good. they totally drifted from the original concept.
B0011EU0NG|5.0|I have really enjoyed this movie ever since it came out so I decided to add it to my collection.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Who doesn't like Solitaire, this game will always be a classic in anyones book. I am not sure what else you can really say about it.

B000FC1HBY|5.0|I am still reading this book, and I cannot put it down. Excellent! G. Martin kept the same excitement and wonderful imagery as on the first book. Can't wait to start on the third.
B000W7JWUA|4.0|Got him this game for Christmas last year, haven't heard how he likes it. I guess he has played it.
B007C7UZIG|5.0|Get to see my accoutered and everything its just like I'm on steam on the computer!!! I definitely recommend this app!!!
B0070NSPCU|5.0|At the beginning of the story with, again, a situation of a young kid going to some kind of academy to learn his trade made me think of a \\"not again\\". That part goes relatively fast so we can get on with less run-of-the-mill storytelling.<br />The main character is great with tough decisions to make.
B000T433CO|5.0|Fun light hearted and heart warming! Love it! It will be nice to watch it anytime I want! Great actors and citing, beautiful scenery.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I liked the book a lot until I came to the ending.  DId not find it believable.  Thought of ten other endings I would have written instead.
B003K16PAU|5.0|Orwell went &#34;slumming&#34; to find out how the other half lived in Paris (5th arrondissement) and London's Limehouse district. He describes his experiences as a vagrant, hobo, and menial workman. Worth a read.
B008CLI3TE|5.0|Game of Thrones is not for everyone. If you do however like to get emotionally involved in a great story with beautiful scenery that can keep you guessing this is for you. The show is beautifully done and aesthetically pleasing. The story line is where people will start splitting. If you can't handle getting involved with the character's lives and becoming attached over long periods of time, do not watch it. You will find some people revolting, whinny, and down right disgusting, others will be honorable, good-hearted, and passionate. If you cannot watch someone you hate or love to hate someone do not watch this show. If you enjoy being submersed in the chaos of it all, it's a great gut-wrenching ride. If you haven't read the books, please note anyone can die at anytime throughout the series if you cannot handle getting attached to someone only to have them die.<br /><br />Do Not Watch IF: You cannot handle nudity, sexual content, incest, seeing a bad guy win on occasion, or homosexuality. This series is not for you.<br /><br />Problems that have been encountered with the blu-ray are that they will stop loading or discs stopping in the middle of the show. Others say the menus are little to be desired. This is for the Product not the actual show.
B000FC1RCI|5.0|I read this once or twice a year I enjoy it so much. It inspired the classic movie of the same title with Barry Fitzgerald, Walter Huston, et al. I've had it on my bookshelf for donkey's years and I've worn several editions out. Now its on my Kindle!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Do I really have to do with out the show for so long?? This is the best show on tv to date.
B001GMH8RO|1.0|I watched this film over three days , and each time I fell asleep .<br />It's the most boring film I have seen this year!<br />Normally, I wouldn't have bought this film with that title , but I was seduced by the price and good reviews .<br />For me , it was a waste of money and time .
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|The box set that I received is finally something that I can be proud and happy with AMAZON US as this time round, it comes properly SECURED package without any sort of damages to the box set (as compared to the first initial set that weren't properly package for delivery. A case of too little to none protection whatsoever).<br /><br />Now for the movie, this Blu ray remastered film is obsolutely gorgeous for a 60's musical flick and the audio was fine and dandy (what do you expect with a 60's musical anyway?!) The extras are pretty interesting especially the interview done by Julie Andrew with the real Maria !!!<br /><br />A must have for anyone that appreciate good family oriented musical. Highly recommended.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|I burned out on JRPGs a while back. Don't get me wrong, loved Final Fantasy, Chrono Trigger, Wild Arms, etc... but the grinding kills me when I go to replay them. This is fresh and enjoyable to me. I have never played any Persona game before!<br /><br />It has a heavy emphasis on story and activities instead of grinding for levels. Playing on Normal, I only had to grind once to get some levels to beat one boss. Difficulty ranges from Very Easy to Hardcore.<br /><br />Slow start to the game, but still interesting enough for me to keep wanting to play. Talking about like 60-90 minutes to get the story going somewhere.<br /><br />The story is intriguing with elements of mystery and murder, with a little bit of a modern Alice in Wonderland feel since you fall down a rabbit hole.<br /><br />Time limits are in place to save people from certain doom. If you fail, you can reset 7 days back on the game's calendar or just reload a save.<br /><br />Environment is sandboxy but not entirely open world. You can explore specific areas of the city and talk to whoever you want. Build relationships with other characters to increase the abilities of both you and them.<br /><br />If you die in battle, the difficulty you have chosen will decide whether you can restart a battle, a floor of a dungeon, or just be dead forever and need to reload.<br /><br />The music is really well done and the voice acting dubbing is not irritating. Anime cutscenes are good.<br /><br />I believe you can log anywhere from 60-100 hours in this game depending on how fast you go through the days and if you listen to all of the voice acting.<br /><br />Seriously, one of the best darn JRPGs I have played in a long time!
B00571F26Y|5.0|I have known for years that I am more satisfied eating the contents of a big old fashioned hamburger WITHOUT the bun than if I eat two WITH the bun.  People always look at me in disbelief when I say it.  NICE to have confirmation from Dr.Davis.<br /><br />What I learned about all the other health destruction from modern wheat is no less than astounding!  With all the bone on bone joint replacements that are the trend today, it might benefit these folks to know that eliminating wheat from their diets might stop the destruction of cartilage and prevent the second or third (or more?) joint replacement!<br /><br />While tiresome in its expressiveness, everyone would benefit from reading this book.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|I received this as a free app of the day. some levels were a little challenging. but overall. fairly easy to do. I would recommend this. It is good size game 20 levels
B004J64QSI|5.0|My husband and I LOVE this version of Les Mis--Alfie Boe has the most incredible voice and his performance here is superb!<br />I bought this as a last minute Christmas gift and am eagerly awaiting it's arrival. I haven't been as impressed with other voices ..think this is the best collaboration out there.
B0063IH60K|3.0|I love the game, but hate the provider.  Mobility Wire appears to feel the need to require me to \\"skip\\" their latest offering in able for me to play a set.  I know, buy it and it's ad free.  But why should I pay to play a card game, even if it's virtual.
B00AMBK6J2|3.0|I was expecting it to be funnier.  Especially with all the hype behind it.  Seen funnier this year. Just ok.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|It has once again sucked me in with the updates and new scenarios.  Only complaint is that on one set the first two scenarios are new, but the balance are merely the originals tacked in with my scores.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I can't begin to count the hours my son has logged playing this game in create and survival modes.  It is almost like a journal as he creates items and worlds that relate to current interests and events of his life.
B007N5YIUS|1.0|Amazon listed this game on Kindle Fire list.  But this game is for Android devices only.  Kindle Fire is not Android.  So can't really say I hate the game since I'm unable to even try it.
B000P0J0D8|5.0|great loved it gave it to my son it was a gift ,...he loved it,,what else can i say ty
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I play this games almost every day.  Got some updates that make it a new experience.  Waiting for more updates.  But the ads are getting in my way.
B009KHDT0C|3.0|confusing and sort of blah, until the very end.  you never know where this is going or where the story line came from or why!
B005HSL626|1.0|Senseless time-suck.  Might be ok for 6 or 7 year old.  Can't even lay claim to educational game.  At least Angry Birds and Stupid Zombies teach a bit about geometry and physics.
B0034G4P4O|4.0|Very cute and well drawn/played, if your a fan of Indian Jones and/or How To Train Your Dragon you will like this movie. It's a story like Indiana but has the same look and feel of Dragon, if your a BBC fan you will recognize voices. Enjoy the thrill ride and story line, i look forward to the next one (as the left room for another) :)
B0064TVQ5E|1.0|Thought it would be like the preloaded PC version.  No way no how.  Extraordinarily confusing.  Didn't like the patterns or multiple sets on the page.
B005LAIH4A|3.0|Not by far my favorite- even my favorite dr. seuss, it's a gift for 5 year old daughter. However the moral of the story is important, that you need to take care of your world and that it only takes one person to destroy or save the world.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|This book is too much to take at once. And it compliments to 4 hour body. So far I am cooking one breakfast dish & one lunch and dinner dish. But I really like how I can make really good tasting dishes at home at very low cost. Cost being running cost(food cost) & initial cost(equipment cost). Most people don't realize that how cheap & hassle free it is to cook great food at home. But my suggestion is don't just read it all at once. Read a little and make food or learn something. Love this book.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|It has nice graffics and plenty of challenges.  Rovio should come out with more free games like this one and their others.
B00005OOQ5|5.0|I love all of the Cirque du Soleil DVD's, even the documentaries. These people just plain amaze me. I am in awe of them and I will watch all of my Cirque DVD's many, many times.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I would recommend this app for anyone that does file maintenance.  It is easy to use and allows you to even access servers and web files.
B0086DBE62|4.0|Not pretentious. Just a nice funny movie that's well presented and a good twist on an old classic. A great cast too.
B008RTE09S|5.0|The film we Beatles fans all know well...restored and remastered audio in 5.1. A bunch of bonus features...even 4 hidden easter eggs that make this all you need. I gained much more respect for this film and understand why Steven Spielberg uses this film as a must-see for people wanted to get involved in films. You gotta have it! It's the bloody Beatles!
0142410705|2.0|this was the second book by john green i read. the good thing was that it only took about half a day to finish. i can hardly remember the last book i read that was such a breeze. besides the fact that it's intended for a young adult audience, the easy to read quality obviously have something to do with green's ability to control the flow of a narrative as well. his is a very clean style and gently nudges you to continue even if you're not in love with it right away. i never did fall in love with it, but it's commendable that i was at least persuaded to finish. i can't say what it was but it just wasn't enough.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I love the Jack Reacher books and this one did not disappoint!  Lee Child is a great story teller, his stories have such depth to them.  I am ready for the next book!!!
0684824906|1.0|Bought book for my husband who is interested in Lincoln but not into politics.  Book was returned as a result.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|i really like the fast charger. it saves a lot of time and i love it that i dont have to worry about the cord being in the way or not being able to use my kindle while it is charging. really good investment.
031603973X|4.0|I take my grandchildren to see the production every year.  Now we have this wonder book to enjoy ALL year!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I don't even know where to begin with this review considering that every single piece of this novel was pure perfection.<br /><br />The characters and the way they developed in this story were perfect. I felt completely invested in them right from the beginning.<br /><br />The romance was perfectly paced and heartwarming without ever seeming cheesy or juvenile.<br /><br />As with the author's other two books, the dialogue was witty, original and makes you hope that someday you will be fortunate enough to meet Colleen Hoover in person and see if she speaks with the same level of intelligence and humor that her characters do.<br /><br />And lastly, the plot... To say that this story includes twists and turns that keep you breathless is an understatement. The emotional turmoil Sky and Holder go through is heartbreaking and yet instead of feeling pain and grief for them all you feel is compassion, love and a deep desire to wrap your arms around them and give them a huge, healing hug.<br /><br />I could go on forever about this story but fortunately I am the reader and not the wordsmith. Thankfully for all of us Colleen Hoover is the best of the best in that department.<br /><br />5 huge stars and right to my all time favorites bookshelf
B0084U0IEG|3.0|Sweet tooth. Somewhat boring at times. I liked the ending though. Not really a book that made me happy to sit down and read.
B0009PTXTK|4.0|The horse is a Christmas gift for my granddaughter.  I thought the horse was very detailed and sturdy.  Sturdy is important, since my granddaughter is 3!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This is by far the most fun game of the series so far. Do not hesitate at all to get this. It is Awesome!!!! Be prepared to be addicted.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|I bought Sons of Anarchy: Season One as a Christmas present for our son-in-law, who loves this show.  I'm sure it will be one of his favorites!
B0076DELIG|5.0|I can't get enough of Harry Bosch.  I am going to be so sad when I am finished with the book.  So far it keeps you interested.  I have not read one bad book of Michael Connelly's yet.
B000K4WPCC|5.0|It arrived early, It's in great condition and i'm very happy with it. It's one of my favorite movie's i'm glad i own it.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Have read almost all of the Harry Bosch books and found this one interesting, different story line..easy enjoyable reading.<br />Look forward to the next book in the series.
B000X2H8G4|5.0|I choose 5 star because of the clarity of sound pick up. It seems to collect all sound around you and gather them all in the middle of your head. If you have difficulty hearing, get one of this and you will see the difference. Adjust the volume that suits your hearing though because an annoying hisssss would blur the sounds you want to hear if set to very high volume. When adjusted to the right volume, you get the best result. It might be bulky but the sound quality overwhelms the negative side of its size. I bought one for my father, who already has difficulty hearing. He enjoys it because he loves watching TV and want to be able to join casual conversation with those around him.
0395389496|3.0|I got this especially for my 8 year old who is \\"borderline\\" about believing in Santa. We watch the movie all the time. The 25th anniversary edition appealed to me so I ordered it last minute for Christmas. I received it today and the bow sticker on the sleeve was peeling, plus the \\"keepsake\\" ornament is cardboard!
B002ZG99TA|5.0|Denzel has been in a submarine movie, train movie, airplane movie ... What is next? If you love excitement, this movie is for you. Gripping.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|I liked the movie and might buy it.Would watch again.might watch it again soon.Likedthe actores was a good movie<br />like
B0098VYKSA|3.0|The characters just don't make you care. No chemistry between Snow White and the Huntsman. The Queen was the best acted of them all.
0770433782|5.0|Every page of this book is breathtaking. I was an avid reader/drooler of Style Me Pretty as a bride years ago and this book does not disappoint. Fresh weddings, ideas, styles and inspiration galore. Bravo SMP!
B004PR71JC|5.0|This is a very family friendly movie, and I would recommend it. I have watched it a few times with my granddaughter.
B005EHILV4|5.0|Works as expected and the set up was simple once I figured out I need to download ASIO driver.  Sound quality seems pretty good so far.  Definitely satisfied with this purchase.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I do love it!  and its cute how they tell the story of star wars too. Also love the new ways that they use new powers from the star wars movies. dmb.
B006ZCWU5K|5.0|What a fabulous collection of songs.  I really like the overall theme & the music is fantastic.  Great album to follow up Working on a Dream.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|I had to give up on Amazon streaming and use Comcast to see the whole movie which is very funny, Too bad Amazon streaming is so unreliable.
8866130923|5.0|I love my Moleskine planner. It is beautiful and so elegant. I love that the weekly planning is on the left side and the right side is all lined. I have been wanting a planner like this for a long time. I don't know how I never knew that Moleskine offered a planner like this before!! I also really like the monthly feature, in the very beginning they have columns from January to December 2013, and then January to December 2014, with the days numbered. This is perfect for my writing goals, since I want to keep track of how much I write everyday next year. It is such a snazzy planner. It is heavy duty and fits perfectly in my purse. I would recommend it to anyone!
B002RVZV9K|3.0|I say could have been because I saw the whole thing and more in bits and pieces on Youtube.<br />Had I looked further I could have reviewed the actual full length video as well before purchasing.<br />It's kind of nice to have just for the purpose of sharing but there was a lot of scenes left out of the video that one can view on Youtube and for that reason I gave it 3 stars.
0345357116|4.0|Got this for my dad for Christmas. It came 3 days sooner than stated. It was in great shape, but not perfect. Corners/edges were a little damaged, but nothing more than handling from a good 1 or 2 reads.
B00622B3MY|1.0|This movie opens with violent scenes including guns and fighting and that should have been a sign to me that this movie wasn't going to be good. The whole movie included all the things I really didn't want my 2 1/2 year old watching. All the wholesome fun that I loved with Cars was gone with this move. Mater was this stupid goon who they all laughed at, not a good way to teach kids about friends. Lightning McQueen was a jerk! There was very little actual racing as the whole plot centered around some convoluted plot that was above the heads of most of their target audience (alternative fuel? are you kidding me?). This movie is terrible on so many fronts. Tomorrow it's going to Goodwill.
B008GIDZHS|5.0|maravilloso volver a la infancia, se dieron muchas veces las peliculas de superman, una maravilla recordar viejos tiempos. se muy bien
B009HEJXFS|5.0|I was smiling before the movie even started. Will smith is always his best in every movie he plays. He is always true to his character.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|excelente excelente excelente excelente excelente excelente excelente excelente excelente excelente excelente excelente excelente excelente excelente excelente excelente excelente excelente excelente excelente excelente excelente excelente excelente excelente muy bueno todo me encanto rapido
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Absolutely hilarious and I could not stop reading. Loved every minute and now feel the need to re-watch every episode of 30 Rock.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The plots are great each episode have you guessing what is coming next. One of the best that is out there keep up the great work we could not ask for anything better for this season. So many of us correspond at work it is one of the highlights that goes on at work the discussions we have in regards to this tv show, thank you again for giving us a trill and understanding what the public is seeking.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Enjoy seeing Harry in solving the cold cases and the involvement of his daughter.<br />Hard to put down at times.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Rod Stewart has really grown-up from the 70's and 80's of my youth!  This is a really nice Christmas album and I paid less than half the price I would have at WalMart!  Thanks!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This is a great book.  I could hardly put it down.  I can't wait until the next one comes out.  Hate I have to wait until May for that one.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I don't allow many video games at home, but this is sure a life saver in the doctor's office, at a meeting, or other less than ideal environments where a child needs to be seen and not heard.  It would be nice if I did't ever have to place my son in such a situation, but that's just the way it is.
B006TLFPKO|4.0|I liked it better than all of the other Twilight movies. A lot more action and definately better acting. Cannot wait to see the finale.
B009VSW15Y|2.0|I'm not at all tech savvy so I loved how easy this was to install and use.  However, the pictures are terrible--grainy, bad lighting, etc. and of course it is backwards.  So basically, all you can do is take unflattering pictures of yourself.  No thanks!
B002SJIO4A|4.0|Blomkamp's darkly comic, intelligent satire is also hugely entertaining and contains a tour-de-force performance from the unknown lead Sharlto Copley. Although the allegory is thinly veiled, and the logic somewhat flawed, it still packs a significant punch. The movie deals with themes we're all familiar with but adds a freshness to the mix by placing a stranded alien race at the heart of the matter. There's lots of gore, lots of profanity, lots of energy, and lots of humour. And the message is thoughtfully constructed: the lead character's dramatic and poignant epiphany is all the more believable because of his conflicted viewpoint. It's also worth mentioning the effects, which are impressive given the apparently modest budget. Excellent and worthy of 4.5/5.
B004WGGQPQ|3.0|...which isn't bad considering the cost.  Also, I don't have the guilt of &#34;using electronics to babysit my children&#34; as this is completely is a completely open ended activity.  It is basically just a way to draw and doodle without wasting a bunch of paper.
B009V3KKXY|4.0|I am a beginner in the realm of paracord tying. I have only tied the covers stitch or Solomon as j.d. refers to it. This book opened up much more in the way of variety. The illustrations in the book are fantastic and make it easier to tie the knots!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Dark....but a great read. I was unable to put it down after I started the series. I look forward to future work.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Great app glad to have it. The price was right and have  no complaints. I would<br />Recommend it to my friends as well as my relatives.  Thanks!
B005LAIIPS|4.0|I watched this movie twice on blue ray because it is a little hard to follow.  Jeremy Renner plays Aaron Cross, training in Alaska as part of a clandestine CIA program, the same one which spawned Jason Bourne.  He imbues his characer with more depth than would be expected.  Rachel Weitz plays Dr. Marta Shearing, a scientist in the same program.<br /><br />Aaron  narrowly escapes assassination by unknown forces.  Dr. Shearing becomes involved when when one of her colleagues turns into a madman, killing all the doctors in their lab except her.<br /><br />Thus begins an adventure which ultimately take Marta and Aaron to the Philippines.<br /><br />Although confusing, \\"The Bourne Legacy\\" is never boring.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Glad to see Jack Sr. back in the White House, Jack JR, saving the world and the Rest Clark, Chaves all doing well.  Cannot wait for the next one to come out.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|We really enjoy the laughter from Sheldon, Penny, Leonard, Raj, and Howard and the rest after a long day.  Have seasons 1 through 4...looking for more in the future.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I do not like this new updated FB! I would like to see all of my friends posting! plz fix it!
B008JGSM6G|2.0|I was really expecting a lot more out of this.  I think I played for maybe five minutes and got incredibly bored with it.
B000YJ6736|5.0|pclever storey difficult to write about ,he carries it off.His sytle is impeccable.it is a fantastic storey about sexual encounter
B009SCR7RU|5.0|The last of a four-part series invoking themes of the seasons and problem solving through curiosity and friendship, Secret of the Wings is a favorite of my four year-old twins, who have also loved the other three.  This is not your mother's (or father's) helpless Disney princess waiting for her Prince Charming to come save her.

B008JFUUIA|2.0|The trailer was great...most trailers are. They find all the best parts, put them together and then you want to see the movie. Sadly, you know from the first five minutes how this movie is going to go. There are no big surprises here and the movie just doesn't work. I wanted to like this movie...really I did.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Fun to play for entire family. It's easy.<br />Good, fun, easy, suitable family and small kids, old people, colorful display. Love it.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Love this show. The charaters just keep getting better. The storyline keeps getting more interesting all the time. It was a fantastic purchase.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|This app needs a lot of work, I can't see more than 10  posts at a time. I don't really use it because you can't do much!
B0083SBMBM|5.0|The best superhero movie ever. The one liners are great. This was fun for the whole family, we watch it repeatly.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|I enjoyed this movie.  However, compared to the book, it just doesn't measure up.  The book reads seamlessly with regard to real history and the made up and the pictures just make the book.  This can't be captured in the movie.  But if you like vampire movies, I am sure you will enjoy this movie...I do
B000FC1HBY|5.0|The arc of Martins characters is rich and complex, flaws, warts and all means you rarely can predict what any of them is going to do next. Lots of action, in battles and &#34;elsewhere&#34; but, you don't have to like swords and sorcery to get into this tale.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Easy to play. It takes awhile to buildup forces but there is plenty to do while you wait. Careful with your badges, they are hard to get and easy to lose
B001EBV0NU|5.0|If taken seriously, even as a comedy, Mars Attacks has to be one of the worst movies ever made!  If taken as a complete farce, it is very funny.  If you drink, it is better to drink before you watch this movie.  If you are sober (or the least bit serious), you should avoid this movie at all costs!  The cast is amazing!  It is also shocking to realize how great actors can look like idiots when they are given terrible lines.  My suggestion is that this is good for a late night, after party viewing with close friends and family (who are a little crazy).
B001KZI7FO|5.0|My daughter was entranced by rhe bell when I gave it to her at 5 years old. We still have the bell and she cherishes it. We listen to the music every year and the book on cd is nice to hear too.
B009ZE27US|4.0|I really enjoy it&hellip;, so does my family.Bit the thing people don't understand is it's NOT suppose to be real results it's fun so SHUTUP AND ENJOY IT!!!!!!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game was very adventurous and had a lot of mini games. Great graphics too! I highly recommend this game to anyone.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|fun to play. kids enjoy it as much as I do. love the old atari style games. hope to see updates soon.!!!
0743270754|4.0|The idea of emphasizing the rivals in Lincoln's cabinet is different from anything else I've read about that period.  However, Goodwin uses up too many pages on the socializing in Washington..especially with Kate Chase. 757 pages is is a big bite, and some trimming tto the identified issue would have been appreciated.
0425264351|5.0|I've been working my way through the series and have enjoyed them all.  This one grabs you from the FIRST SENTENCE.  Good fast read!
B0065CCM76|5.0|This is an excellent album for fans of Bob Seger and The SilverBullet Band. It does not have ALL of his hits,but NO compilation has all of an artist. If there are others you,you can buy those as singles.
B00843TZJ2|3.0|I saw a clip of this DVD/CD package.  Being a long time CSN and Stills fan, I bought it.  Stills still has his chops on his guitar.  Yes I agree with many that his voice isn't what it once was.  Time, and bad choices have taken their toll on his voice.<br /><br />Graham Nash tries to do his best with vocals but I find his voice too over the top.  It's too nasally and whiney to me.<br />But this is why you have 4 other people there to help with vocals.  The Band was tight for sure.<br /><br />I see that Crosby had to have his son along for the ride.  James Raymond is a fine musician in his own right of course.  But he needs to step into his own limelight.<br />In closing I know that this whole affair /DVD are produced by Nash and that is why his vocals overtake every ones.<br /><br />Nash knows that had it not been for Crosby and Nash, he would have been still been singing Carrie Ann at some oldies show<br /><br />Peace
B007THA4FI|2.0|The Casual Vacancy.  I would have enjoyed it much more without the profanity!  The story was a bit weak and long and it just didn't hold my interest.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I cannot say enough good things about this girl.  She has breathed life into a violin lover with her energy and talent.
034580404X|5.0|Bought the trilogy as a present but decided to read it myself. Very well written and a series that is destined for the film. I loved book one and two the most but read the third to complete the series.
B0042J6VUS|5.0|I like this tripod good quality and fit for iphone 4 and hold it very well I recomnded this product for who like take pictures by smartphone
B00447G29S|5.0|This is an excellent movie to watch during the Xmas Holiday Season for the whole family.  The 3D is not extraordinary but it was fun enough for all of us.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|It was an easy read, especially on a rainy day.  I enjoyed the fact that both characters had their own insecurities.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I love Mahjong so I wanted to try this one, it is a challange to do this one but worth it.  You have to work alittle bit harder for this one but well worth it.<br />Enjoy its fun.
B00000J2PH|5.0|Carole King came out with Tapestry and I listened to every song on it over and over. When I served in the Army we were buying Turn-Tables and listening to vinyl LPs  and over the years moving all over the world things were lost or grew legs and walked off. Today I still listen to all the greats like Carole King, James Taylor, Carly Simon and a host of others as well.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Love this game so easy and so much fun.<br />Try it you will love it. You will not want to stop playing.
141659521X|5.0|Loved the book.  Fast moving.  I was not disappointed.  Interesting plot and characters with lots of twists and turns and intrigue.
B007BVOEPI|3.0|I love these books and Sean Bean so I couldn't wait to watch this show. I like the whole story but it is a bit too graphic for me, and certainly not appropriate for kids.
B00AE2I4WK|5.0|Awesome dancing!  It makes you want to dance and it has a good story to go with all that dancing.
0307591549|5.0|Simply put, a  great book the more I read the happier I became and it's to everyone's advantage to read...
B001QWBM62|5.0|I loved the quality of the recording and of the Mics.<br />I totally recommend it!<br /><br />It is portable. You don´t need to carry lots of equipment just jo make a good recording.
0399157565|1.0|I bought this assuming this would be a usually solid Cornwell book. Wrong! What a boring, tedious mess. Way too much useless detail. Never really focused on the actual crime. Hey Kay - divorce the bum already, or maybe you need a shrink. Also tiresome to constantly read about her perfect home, needless detail on what she eats. I could go on - just don't waste your money on this turkey.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I love the Harry Bosch series.  I always enjoys reading about Harry's private life as well as his professional one.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|I read this on a Kindle. Very interesting setup and I hope there is a series to follow. I also hope Sanderson will speed up the Stormlight series, the first book was a fantastic read.
B0083XFFWO|5.0|As I expected, I'm very satisfied<br /><br />I use it, it is very comfortable and light, I recommend<br /><br />excellent buy<br /><br />Regards
B007L3BMGA|2.0|Sex : explicit.  Remainder: soppy.  Can´t believe a multimillionaire and a graduate would correspond by e-mails in the way they did.
B007SGM084|5.0|I ABSOLUTELY LOVED these books! I love Christian and his controlling/domineering ways! I also LOVED Ana! At first I was very afraid for her, but then I enjoyed Christian's protectiveness of her and it was ALL good from there on! I loved their emails back and forth to each other, it was fun and funny. I enjoyed how the story developed giving insight to Christian's behavior. All of the characters had enough info about them to make them important to the story. I love the way the story was written, it just flowed so naturally! I hated that it ended. I HOPE that there will be MORE books on Christian and Ana. PLEASE Mrs. James.....like Ana I want MORE!!!
B008M721MS|4.0|it is very nice and vearly easy to use .glad i got one. i recommand it to any one. cant wait to get more things on it
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I love this app I had it for my Ipod and it was so fun and the Christmas edition and the 1st version and it was awesome the one thing that I don't like is that I wish it had more people. On my Ipod I have all the Toca Boca apps I hope that Toca Boca will spread. :D
B004SBQGHS|5.0|there is a free one so get that one I love it so much so get it free please. /
B000SXLL8O|2.0|Like Coldplay, but maybe only their hits. This album was cool but it wasnt for me. Maybe after a while it will grow on me
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is awesome. it is so much fun. it is so addicting. I only wish that the characters had more energy
B00A3DZ61W|4.0|Love the new abilities that these crazy birds can do. The levels are great. One of the best Angry birds that has come out so far. Don't like that they have the additional levels at an extra charge but I guess the developers have to pay the bills.<br /><br />One thing that I don't like is that Amazon is slow at releasing updates for this. It was days before I got the new Hoth levels. Amazon really needs to push out these updates at a quicker pace.
0894803123|5.0|neat book. good recipes inside. a must for the home made ice cream maker in the house. go for it.
B004Q9TYWQ|5.0|I loved this book. It literally had me laughing out loud. I was afraid there would be a lot of the same stuff  I had seen on the website, but it wasn't. This is a must read.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I like the storyline a lot! I like how the characters are built as the story goes through. Lastly, I recommend this to all hopeless romantic people because once again after fifty shades of grey Christian grey will capture your heart. Butterflies all over again! Can't wait for freed!
B0076DCT2G|1.0|Very disappointing......all the other De Mille books were great...this one was long, boring, poor storyline and not worth the read
B008AK8FHM|5.0|WELL WRITTEN,  UNBIASED, AND SEPARATED  FROM A SIMPLE RELIGEOUS VIEWPOINT . BELIEVABLE AND WELL EVALUATED FROM A MEDICAL PERSPECTIVE. A FIRST PERSON EXPERIENCE.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Great games for my daughter to play to keep her busy. I enjoy playing the games with her. Its always &quot;Mommy! get me more points! &quot;
B00AMBLDEE|3.0|I like the Jason Bourne movies. Great actors! Plot seems to be the same. Expected more. Just okay, glad I didn't purchase.
B000NA1OXY|5.0|I love Avril's music now my daughter is loving it.  The shipped fast and the price was perfect.  Love listening to her
B00280LYHS|5.0|This book was absolutely awesome . I loved the other books,And this one is even better . Annabeth and Percy prevail their true feelings , and Percy is asked to be a God , awesome 100 stars
B009FZFONO|5.0|This is a great season.  I didn't think I was going to like a tv series about a zombie Apocalypse but its rather entertaining if you have a strong stomach.
B006LSZECO|5.0|yGot used to the story constantly switching back and forward in time but with that conquered it was a great story. I had seen Gone Girl listed in the Kindle store for a long time but didn't buy it till I got the Kansas U. alumni magazine and saw a featured article about Gillian Flynn and her 3 ..novels. Now, I'm reading her second or third mystery, both of which preceded Gone Girl. All three are a bit nostalgic for me because I grew up in Johnson County in Eastern KS and my great grand father homesteaded in Ottawa County KS at a little bitty town called Delphos, north of Minneapolis, KS, where my Dad, a Kansas City Urologist and four siblings were raised. Grandfather, W.R. Brown had been a state Senator and rancher from Pottawattomie County. Sorry, I digress. Loved all three.<br />More nostalgia for me in the third novel because it's centered in a Mo. bootheel town near Hayti. During the depression and extensive drouth in KS in the early 30's, W.R. Brown shipped his cattle to Sikeston, Mo. because he learned that there were waste piles of cottonseed hulls that the cattle could digest. Later, back in KS, he shipped in Cottonseed Cake for his Hereford and Angus cattle. But I digress.
B0050PYNO4|5.0|Movies awesome! Who doesn't love Simon Pegg and Nick Frost? Great deal for the holidays. Perfect gift! Very very funny!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This one has a legal background without the (sometimes tedious) courtroom detail.  High intrigue makes you actually pulling for criminal activity.
B009A9EQL6|4.0|Not so sure if this is the old days, but it is definitley much better than Just Push Play , and there are some really good songs...............Street Jesus is awesome , and there are typical ballads , the extra CD with the three songs .........well they should have one song and it should have been on the regular CD Sunny Side Of Love.....Joe Perry should not perform any lead vocals on the regular CD! Overall i would say on a scale of 1- 10 it is a 7.
B0093H8H8I|5.0|This processor is currently installed into a HTPC machine.  I am using the onboard video to display 1080p content without any hiccups.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I laughed... I cried... it kept me wanting more.... all in all great book and I just purchased the second book lol
B00634GHJA|2.0|It's always mal-functioned ever since I downloaded it.  It provides very limited instructon so I never figure out how to use it.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|Very funny, look for additional little laughs on boxes and in the  background . A must see! Not for children!!
B009GESJH2|5.0|this is a great xmas stocking stuffer gift for my family. everyone loves Kid Rock music and it is a great gift idea.
1439130833|5.0|I absolutely LOVE the daily teachings.  I am able to start out each day with some inspirational thoughts.  I would recommend this to anyone.
B005GG0MIS|4.0|The Presidents Club  provide a unique view of how current and previous Presidents interact. I would recommend for readers that have an interest in US history.
1582701709|5.0|This is a must have book for anyone that focuses on staying positive and having control over your life!  Would also make a great gift for family and friends.
1449410243|5.0|I read this series online all of the time. It's the same as the internet cartoons but is a great coffee table book or gift for cat lovers.
B00AJRQLTI|3.0|I haven't seen the movie yet, so I can't judge how it plays on screen, but I can't say that the innovative recording process delivered a good soundtrack. The vocals often sound distant and tinny, and don't produce an immediate emotional response. The orchestration sounds \\"layered on\\" and never meshes with the vocals- it's all too clear that they were recorded at different times. I have a feeling given a couple of months a top-notch producer could create an album from these recordings that's twice as good. This sounds a bit like someone was sitting in a theater where the movie was playing and recorded it on a hand-held mike.<br /><br />As for the performance, Russell Crowe is pretty awful, and wrecks some of the most powerful and moving moments in the show. Sasha Baron Cohen sings with a French accent when no-one else does, and underplays the song, when it really needs the opposite.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman is clearly the main attraction, everyone else is serviceable.
B000NK7JYW|5.0|I had this album a long time ago when it was first released. I wanted an LP because the backmasking is easier to manipulate in this format. That, and I just like hearing it again.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I finished reading this about five days ago.  It's the kind of writing where scenes and dialogue tend to pop into your mind at odd moments and get you to thinking about the characters and the predicament they're in.  Seldom does a book have this effect on me.  I won't bother describing the world that Wool is set in.  For me, the possibility of such a thing happening is...well...haunting!  I've read a lot of dystopic works, including Margaret Atwood.  This one is possibly even more onerous than hers.  Shot through the story are themes in effect today, not the least of which is a small group able to control a much larger and probably much more deserving group.  A truly excellent read!
B0041KVW2K|5.0|Being able to play any of the Beatles' LP's at any time of my choosing, and on a new turntable. Priceless. 'Nuff said...
B009HQ9UHC|2.0|The game may be reasonably good (I suspect the non free version is good) but is constantly interrupted by advertizements many of which are videos.
B007Q0OV6Q|5.0|Bought this for 5 and 7 year old.<br />I bought 2011 and 2012.<br />We eneded up opening only 2011 this year.<br />Next year they will both get one.<br />They were patient to wait for each day to open a surprise.<br />Took turns building it .<br />Pricy but it's worth considering how many days they will play with it.<br />I am kind of curious to see what they will do with it after Christmas.<br />I could not be happier with this purchase. Great packaging.
B009LH1Y1W|4.0|After last season, this one holds together.  The producers are clearly winding down the story, but it's well done and well acted.
B004NNUZ5K|5.0|I learned more in the first 2 days of reading this book than the last several years of casual mixing. The step by step guidelines for setting balance alone is worth the price of the book. Using the methods presented here suddunly my mixes have more depth, clarity and sound much more professional. Great read!
B008602KQI|5.0|The first time I saw this movie, it was really disturbing. The second time, I appreciated the originality of the story and the drama it produces. Riveting!
0446554995|5.0|I love the introduction of twin sons. Pendergast novels have always been about the oddities/challenges of the Pendergast family and how Aloysius deals with them, learns from them, learns things about himself from them, etc. This is an enthusiastic addition to that theme.
B007Q0OV6Q|4.0|Didn't like that they upped the price this year but its helped get my six year old out of bed every morning for the last month - perfect Pre-Christmas gift for any kid who loves legos
B0017QSZW6|5.0|Everything was delivered in a timely manner and great condition...I am very well pleased and will purchase from them again! Thanks. Jonathan Rhys Myer is adorable...love love love this show!
B000YHG72E|5.0|Elf..starring Will Ferrell has become a Christmas favorite!! one of the newer classics! Our family loves watching it ,,it's very funny!!
B000RF7XYO|5.0|Elizaneth is a great look into a tumultuous time period. There is some artistic license ( the putting on the stone makeup in kind of weird, but it's a movie) the costumes are rich. The characters are real and the story is easy to follow.
B004K583KA|5.0|This is five star, because all of the recordings are nice interpretations, and some are as good as it gets.  I studied with Rilling for 10 seasons at the Oregon Bach Festival, and he was an absolute master of the Bach Cantatas.  Some of these are very early recordings, and he changed considerably in recordings done much later, but they are still serviceable.  For the price, these can't be beat.  They are slightly more romantic than the overly stylistic/authentic recordings of Harnoncourt and Gardiner, but a lot more like we listen in today's performances, if anyone is brave enough to present them. All in all, a best buy.
B0076DELIG|4.0|although this book was not up to connelly's usual quality, it was still a better than average read, and i will buy his next book.
B00015N56U|1.0|When I received the DVD, I couldn't get it to play on any of my 3 DVD players.<br />A message came up that said unable to play in this region.  I thought that was<br />weird.<br />So, I contacted the supplier, and they said \\"This item is region 2 (you can see this in the item title).\\" \\"It can only be<br />played on an all region player.\\" I wonder why they would sell such a DVD in the USA, if it doesn't use any devices we sell here.<br />I have never come across that in all of my 72 years. Even if I had seen this, I still wouldn't have know what it meant??<br />I hope they will give me satisfaction.  I am waiting for some kind of exchange or something?
B001RTSPVY|5.0|Very entertaining show!  Sad to see the effects of the world of Meth.  I would definitely recommend this show to friends!
B00AHSINKO|4.0|Brave to tackle a concern of aging adults and younger ones too who get too much into a routine and take each other for granted.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Very entertaining show!  Sad to see the effects of the world of Meth.  I would definitely recommend this show to friends!
B007ZI06FE|4.0|I loved this one however. The take on vampires is interesting and I look forward to more. Even the over the top sex wasn't particularly distracting since it was near the end of the book, and did totally make sense.
B00AMBH70S|2.0|Sadly, this movies is missing Matt Damon, a reasonable script and focus on movie making mot violet chases.  Having enjoyed the quality of the first three movies, I was disappointed by a shallow, predictable film.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|I got a $5 gift card from Amazon for the trial of Amazon Prime. So I decided to use it on this movie. 3 words: Money Well Spent. This movie is action packed, has very funny scenes, and a great plot! I recommend you to either rent it or buy it! You'll Love it. 5 STARS *****
B004SH40BQ|5.0|This thing works great on my iPod classic.  Sucks the battery pretty hard, but that's to be expected.  I get somewhere in the neighborhood of 8 hours on a fully charged classic.  I love that I don't need to charge this transmitter.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This movie has quickly become one of my favorites! It's quirky and a little disturbing (aren't all comedies a bit?) and just a joy to watch over and over!
B0043ZDFEQ|5.0|I can not pick a favorite song......well I love Runaway Baby. I love Marry YOU.<br />Grenade and Just the Way You are.<br />Great buy!<br />Marie
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Wonder is an amazing book. R.G Palacio shows the world through the eyes of a boy with a gene mix in his up, face different . She shows how. Though children may be cruel, they come together to help someone in a time of need. Wonder lives up to its name; it is wonderful.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I love Bruno Mars.....each CD gets better and better.  Locked out of Heaven is my favorite but I am sure I love the other songs just as much.<br />Marie
0312117337|5.0|The cards are beautiful and very deep and lyrical in nature.  Osho is a bit different in interpretation but I moved easily into it going by my own intuition and I like the way the book has several ways of looking at each card.  It's a well-made deck and after two years, it is still in mint condition, despite the fact i use it almost every day.  Take a deep breath and listen to your heart speak.  These cards will assist you.
0143039431|5.0|So nice to be able to buy this book at a discounted price. It was a paperback, and fitted my needs

B005VPRDAY|5.0|The price for the logos was great.  i really like it.  The item was received before the scheduled delivery date.  My niece is enjoying her gift. I like the item that I received. It was just as it was described.  i would recommended this seller if you are thinking about purchasing from them.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This game is great. It's gotten slightly too easy for me lately though. I've built up 10,000 coins, so I don't know that I'll ever have to wait for the coins to replenish again.
0345528581|5.0|This book for an amature (me) was just what I was looking for to be able to do exercises and strength training at home with no special equipment to buy. Lots of diagrams and good explanations of how to do exercises.
B008CJ0KEM|4.0|The show itself gets 5 stars. I love it. The blu-ray gets less mainly because of the picture quality. Sometimes it was crystal clear and stellar. Sometimes it was muddy and full of artifacts.<br /><br />The special features are pretty thin too. Fans are mainly buying this one because of the show itself, but don't go into expecting awesome stuff, because you'll be disappointed.
B0083GR6Y6|5.0|This is a fantastic existentialist movie clothed in an action thriller. I highly recommend it provided that you are willing to think about its themes.  If you're just looking for a mindless action flick then you may be disappointed.
B004EPYZQC|5.0|I love all the movies and did not know what I can add to my hubby's Christmas Stocking--I purchased this movie for my husband loves fast cars--I can't wait to see this movie again--
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|So far so good. Love these type of games and this one is very well made and interesting. My only problem so far was when I purchased the app, for some reason it would not show as purchased, nor would it let me successfully tap the already paid area. However, uninstalling and reinstalling fixed that.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|I always enjoy Kathy Reichs' books.  I find them fascinating with all the detail and the various characters.  Buy it!
B002G1YPH0|5.0|This keeps my cpu at a perfect temperature. For it's price I would suggest this to everyone that has a computer.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|I love all of Patricia Cornwell's books.  They are very well written and always interesting.  Lots of scientific details and interesting characters.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Great book for high school and college kids. Couldn't put the book down once I started. Easy read and recommended!
B0066WJLU6|3.0|not a very bright light but usable i guess if  needed to see when the light go out would help
B001TKK3O8|5.0|Fracture is stupendous, and Hopkins' excellence has no limits : a study in contrast of a devious soul and a honest, unrelenting one. Enjoyed it , wish Hopkins did more such work.
B000LPS4BG|5.0|I can watch this movie more then 10 times and i'll never get bore.....<br />Blueray is the best way to watch movies like this.
B00000DLV1|5.0|I am a mutant with 3 thumbs ,and this is1 of the best sounding live cds I have ever heard in my life... ..3 thumbs up!!!
143353083X|5.0|This study bible is great. The narratives and the explanations before each book really helps the reader understand what they are about to read. The notes at the bottom of the page really helps also. All in all this book is a good side reference to have in addition to a regular bible.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|A prequel to the Alien series???  Not even near the same league.  I guess it answers where the Creatures came from - sorta; but, it creates many more questions and leaves them unanswered.  The cast did a credible job; but, they didn't have much of a story or script to work with.  In short, I didn't find this movie appealing as a standalone or prequel.  As a fan of the Alien series, I'm sorta sorry that I watched it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|If you're into post Apocalyptic reading, or even if you aren't, this book will give you plenty to think about after reading it.  Well written and a real page turner.
B000HKW7E0|1.0|It would have been okay had Clark been at least a faithful man to his wife. The main character fabricates that he is divorced when he meets a girl at the lingerie shop? A Santa-Clark imagines himself seeing the girl naked as he dreams about the family pool? That makes the man not funny, but clearly treacherous. I found the man to be abominable and the movie to be the same. The lack of fundamental morality undermines the value of this movie, especially as a \\"family movie.\\"
B004J4WKTW|5.0|To the. Enter the mystical magical tent for the deeply engrossing of star crossed lovers and ill fated competitors. The prose was so compelling you simply can't  put it down
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|I found this movie to be unpleasant all the way through. And so I must admit the story's effectiveness. Aside from ridiculous character names like Peeta and Katniss, I was mostly convinced of the nightmare world portrayed here. I don't take away any message of hope, courage, dignity, and humanity that the number one review suggests is evident in this film. No, there's not a frame of this movie that isn't either the darkest of jokes or utterly hopeless and sad. Nothing good can come of the story's premise. It makes me wonder why there's supposedly courage and dignity when adults play war games, because there certainly isn't any of that when children are forced to. Part of me is disgusted by the ideas portrayed here, and then I'm reminded that this extreme version of our world holds a deep, dark truth that truly scares me.
B007FLHW3K|5.0|After first having seen the lights at a SIGGRAPH conference a few years ago, they have been on my want list but nothing I could ever justify with the little amount of time I spend riding my bike.<br /><br />Now that my husband rides his bike to and from work on a daily basis, I surprised him with a pair of the wheel lights.  HE LOVES THEM!  And I love that he is more visible to crazy LA drivers.<br /><br />They were easy to install, appeared to be well made and rugged, and he's been using them for a few weeks now and hasn't had to change batteries yet.<br /><br />Thanks so much!
B008602KQI|5.0|I was very impressed by the acting and the director's outstanding choices for how to bring this book to life. It was outstanding and the added features: interviews and background were also very well done.
0740745271|5.0|Beyond 3-D Love it.  I don't like wearing reading glasses.  I hope to improve my vision and enjoy the hidden pictures within a picture.
B009186JYI|5.0|I am the Stones Authority. Cool film. Thank you Andrew Loog Oldham and Allen Klein. Thanks for preserving this all these years. I know that it has been out in various forms befre, but it is now generally available for everyone, not just aficionados who'd pay stupid money to see anything &#34;Stones&#34;. Great footage of the guys that is nicely restored. I like also that it is a peek behind the scenes of one of their small tours. We are not in L.A., London or New York. We are in Ireland. And I think that you get to see an authentic look at what touring bands of the early 60's experienced.  Small and oddball venues, with not much staging for fans who were there as much to see this still relatively new &#34;spectacle&#34; called Rock and Roll, as they were to see the band themselves. Certainly new for those Irish kids, that is for sure. It is also nice to get a couple of moments where we see Mick and Keith hashing out a couple of songs that would later make their appearance on a record, such as &#34;Sitting On a Fence&#34;. One of my favorites. The film has a very strange vibe all the way through, but it is a valuable record of this band as they are breaking out in '65. A record of not just the band, but also of the age and the place. A wonderful time capsule - nearly 50 years ago. And you can also see that they are a very good band, a tight outfit. They can play. Given the limitations of the technology and audience expectations of that time period the audio is all in all not that bad. And the interviews - of which I wish there was more to them - are very good. English schooling of the period certainly paid off in general, because you notice that they can actually form and speak ideas. They weren't just a bunch of yobs. And Jagger is a sharp cat. Even then. As the films ends he speaks what will be remembered as his all time greatest quote - as far as I am concerned. &#34;There is no secret to our success. It is all rather obvious&#34;. And obviously one of the best outfits to have ever done it. Their potential greatness clear to see from the beginning, if you know what to look for.
B004SIP8SY|5.0|Huge fan of anything Quentin touches, so I had to make sure and purchase this on blu-ray since my dvd copy has been misplaced. Shipping was super fast as well, thank you.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Works as expected. A useful app to see what networks are around you, as well as seeing how much competition your own access points must deal with.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I had Hunger Games on my kindle for awhile at the insistence of my daughter and granddaughter.  I finally decided to read it because they kept wanting to know what I thought about it and I wanted to quiet the heckling.  I started reading it one morning, got about 50 pages into it and immediately ordered the second and third books in the series.  Although this is a book supposedly aimed at young adults, it is an idea that could have been explored by some of the my favorite science fiction authors (Isaac Asimov is one of my favorites) and I found it to be not only a plausible scenario but also a possible one in light of some of the things going on in the world today.  The characters are believable, sympathetic, hateful and believable.  After all, human nature tends not to change, no matter what their world becomes.
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|A nostalgic by-the-number JPRG designed as though from the 16-bit era.<br /><br />3 main characters: a fast sword wielding hero, a mighty glacier golem and a squishy sorceress. There are other playable characters, but I'm 15 hours in and I haven't been able to use any of them for longer than a scenario at a time. A pity really. I hope they will form an uber-party by the endgame.<br /><br />It's pretty grind-friendly, with a &#34;tablet&#34; skill system: each character starts with a certain number of skillsets to learn and more to find/buy as the game progresses. Skills you learn are retained even when you switch tablets. The pity is that of course the guest characters have different skillsets and default stats than the main party and you don't play with them long enough to make it worthwhile to grind them up. (Except, I hope, in the endgame.)<br /><br />Graphics and music are serviceable for 16-bit standards. Colorful enough and they do the job, but nothing cutting edge or especially memorable.<br /><br />Touch-to-move controls work well enough except in two situations: maps where exits are near the Status or Map buttons (upper left and right corners respectively) and to get the airship to change heights. The first is just occasionally annoying, but the latter always makes me dive into settings to temporarily change it to virtual control pad. The problem is that to &#34;use&#34; the airship, you have to stand on it and then touch exactly that tile again, and there is almost no wiggle room in interpretation. And if you're trying to board near a landmark, expect to enter the landmark every time.<br /><br />Story is pretty standard. There are a few entertaining parts/characters, but it's not especially bad or good writing.<br /><br />Bottom line: This game is what it is: a formula JRPG. You would probably like this if you like JRPGs, and you probably won't if you don't.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|As I noted in my review of Catching Fire, the premise of this entire series is one you can see happening in light of current events, although hopefully far in the future.  The books are well written and pull you into the plot which continues through all three books  The story is one you might want to see continue in except that this book tied up the loose ends and gave hope for a better future for the characters who ensnared your imagination at the very beginning of the Hunger Games. I'm looking forward to exploring other books written by Suzanne Collins.

B006DRVFRQ|5.0|You'd think with Android under them that Google really ought to have better mobile sites, but whatever. This is better than the mobile webapp of Google Reader.

0547884591|5.0|I am a workaholic and dedicate too much of my time to the company I work for. Reading Tim's book makes you realize what the meaning of life is: experience. Tim inspires us to experience and to get out there. This book teaches cooking, but more importantly it teaches a pace of life, learning, and what to look forward to if you just learn to live.<br /><br />I STRONGLY recommend this book to anyone who cares about living fulfilled and breaking away from what can seem like a monotonous life.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|(1st gen Kindle Fire.)<br /><br />First thing I noticed was that it renders PDFs in much higher quality than Amazon's default reader, especially text in single page view. It's the difference between reading a page at once and having to zoom in and scroll.
B004TTHLBE|2.0|I was terribly disappointed.  &#34;Neverwhere,&#34; by the same author, was the &#34;One Book/One Chicago&#34; recommended by Mayor Daley a few years ago.  I loved it and thought I would enjoy &#34;American Gods.&#34;  A great concept but the narrative moves way too slowly and there is none of the sparkling dialogue or character development that made &#34;Neverwhere&#34; so enjoyable.  I was also disappointed in Gaiman's introduction to &#34;Gods.&#34;  Very unseemly, indirectly insulting anyone who criticized it.  Shame on you&#60; Neil.

B0099TJ4YQ|4.0|This is a good one to have on in the background for a Christmas party. How can you go wrong with JT?
B007SGM084|5.0|A friend of mine recommended these books to me and I'm so glad they did. I really enjoyed reading them. I even fell a little in love with Christian myself. We all need some of that passion in our lives. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|Love this show.
B00A3DZ61W|1.0|I downloaded this app and so far I can only play it for 3 minutes at a time before the screen goes black and I have to reboot my phone.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Best Batman movie in a long time.  Can't wait to see what they are going to follow up with next concerning this series.
B00005NWM3|5.0|I love nickelback and the price was AMAZING!! arrived on time and had no issues with it what so ever.
B000ATQYT2|1.0|I will be returning my Blu Ray copy of The Muppet Christmas Carol because my favorite scene, \\"When Love is Gone\\" is gone. The scene has been deleted.  Bad move...ruined it all for me. I will be purchasing a lesser expensive version with less quality to have the entire movie in tact.
B0055PMJMW|5.0|I can always count on a Harry Bosch story to give me my fill of mystery, along with good characterization and lots of action.  This threesome didn't let me down.
B009SQRC9E|5.0|Arthur Christmas is an instant classic!! Both the kids and adults loved it, and we'll watch it for years to come!
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|This is one in the series.  I ordered it via digital for the kindle.  My grandson is 7 and loves these books.  There are small paragraphs and then a picture.  Thus about 3 pictures and paragraphs on a page.  I am not always thrilled with some of the moral ideas, but we read and talk about it.  the reason is the thinking of the boy is more middle school than age 7.  But the reading level is age 7-8.  I figure anything that gets him to read is good.  He wants to sit and read these.  I would like to see more books with small paragraphs and pictures.  A good start to reading chapter books.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Season 3 was the bomb....cant wait for the next season<br />If you like zombie movies  this is the mother of all mothers....it really good.
B0086700CM|5.0|Kids even as young as Age 5 6 7 will enjoy this game.  My grandson loves it and plays it all the time while we are riding in the car.
B001NHNG64|5.0|I was turned on to the Reacher series by an old high school classmate from 30 years ago.  After all this time he still knows a good read.  I have been up ridiculous hours in the night reading simply because I can't put them down.  Great reads  and, as a voracious reader myself, I highly recommend them.
B008C1O8CA|5.0|It's SO good to finally have the old Green Day back! Although, by the \\"old Green Day\\", I mean the Nimrod/Warning era Green Day, not the Kerplunk/Dookie Green Day. But STILL this is such a breath of fresh air after 21st Century Breakdown, which in my opinion was my LEAST favorite album of theirs. I thought American Idiot was very good, but after that they decided to do ANOTHER rock opera and it was bleh.. sounded like left-overs. Not an album I can listen to from beginning to end. Uno!, Dos!, and Tre! are miles ahead. It's so good to hear they've finally gone back to basics.
B005JR3Y5W|5.0|My husband and I love Zoe and think she is funny and quirky, but we weren't sure how she would be portrayed on a show.<br />Her personality is the same as if you see her in an interview. It's like she isn't even acting.<br />Love the show.
B005DOJ68K|5.0|It is the best of CCR all of their greatest are included. You can't beat the price $2.99 for the whole album.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I love Harry Bosh and will tell everyone to read it. I can't put them down once I start to read one.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|My first kindle book purchase! Can't put it down! It's very well written and draws the reader into the mystery
B008R9QAY6|4.0|great singing and historically interesting. I'm a huge baroque opera fan especially the Handel operas so this rarity was most welcome.
B005K17RU0|5.0|thank you for the free weather app. it is great to know what kind of day to expect with the weather!
B009GEEMLY|5.0|The hulk was my favorite, the rest was alright.  Best movie out so far this year.  I am tired of typing...
B0039TD7RC|2.0|I wish I had read the bad reviews about this product before buying it.  Sadly, it's another victim of the Loudness War.
0790729350|5.0|Everyone should own this, it really shows what Woodstock was. It shows it in different perspectives & it looks amazing. I love this dvd, its one of my favorites & I will keep it forever. & I'll try to influence others to watch it with me. I recommend this product to any1 who has any interest in the era
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I did not put this book down until it was done. This was an amazing story. Sky such a strong person and Holder so passionate. I cried and published. Colleen you did it again. Thank you
B003Y4TSQQ|5.0|This was 1 of the items I was worried about not getting here til after Christmas, the lastest arrival date Amazon gave me was Jan 4th. It arrived yesterday, December 20th! The cd is not for me so I don't know the condition of the disk itself just yet, but it arrived in great condition, there wasn't anything wrong with the outside packaging & the cd was intact. I am very happy that this arrived so quickly!
B0036S4CTS|3.0|First of all why is it $10 to buy for the Kindle when you can buy it used for $.01? But I digress...as noted the book tells the story of two characters on the same day each year, sometimes together and sometimes not.  She drove me nuts because she is so whiney and passive aggressive.  He is a slacker who life has just kind of worked out for.  Eventually she rises and he falls and they are able to meet as equals and that is when the story gets good but it was a long time coming to get there.  Wish I liked it more but not a waste of time...
B009WO7NQO|5.0|The purchase was for my 6 year old. He loves this game. The levels start out easily enough to learn the new birds. The game has great themes for each level. Well worth the purchase price.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|What a wonderful classic. Seen several cinematic versions of this tale, but am so glad I picked up the book.
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|Worth seeing. Don't know how the lead character in this survived so many traumatic incidents and still lived for many more years.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|It is a very good action movie, with witty interactions between the characters. The movie is accessible, with little need to know the back story of the superheros to be able to follow along with the plot, and it is visually stunning.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|She likes it but says the stages have too many quests to complete before you can advance to the next level. She enjoys sitting for short time periods playing this game
B007NZDES0|5.0|It is SADE.  Every knows SADE as good listening music... The product arrived on time and brand new in shrink wrap.
B0000VCZKW|5.0|I bought this for my daughter forChristmas who watches it. Every time it's on TV. She's going to lobe the DVD!
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Easy to download.  I'm still reading the book, but the process is great.  I'll continue to order this way in the future.
1451695195|5.0|theme of this book fits very well with my view of life.  i haven't finished the book yet, but i sure am enjoying it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  It slowly reveals the circumstances that the characters live in and why they are in the silo.  It was a little slow in the middle but was a great story overall.  There were several surprises that I did not expect.
B0099114WO|3.0|As much as I like Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones, I didn't really like this movie all that much.  I thought it sort of dragged and I really didn't find it funny.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I bought it for my niece we played for about  hours last Saturday. We had a great time buying houses and the different animals
B0085YNML2|4.0|An easy non-frustrating, non-violent little game. Go back to previouse levels and improve your score. Great to kll a few minutes with, and easy to put away until later. I would recommend it.
B000O8OTNC|3.0|This little guy is best suited for quick field touch-up work. I've found it invaluable for ultralight backpacking, where the Smith Pocket Pal's svelte 0.8 ounces make it a great alternative to a 2 pound waterstone.<br /><br />Around the shop, however, you'd be much better suited to just use a waterstone, whetstone, etc.
B008469DGY|5.0|Great game that I am enjoying all the time. Interesting and challenging way to pass your spare time. Thanks AmaOn!
0375703764|4.0|HoL isn't for everyone, let me start there.  However as someone who is a fan of both experimental fiction and experimental horror, I found this book to be a refreshing change from most of the mass produced books out there.<br /><br />My one hesitation with it (and the reason I don't give it five stars) actually has to do with the quality of the binding.  I have had to buy this book 3 times as each time within the first reading the pages begin to loosen from the spine and fall out.  This is a book that would benefit, I think, from a decent electronic rendering.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft its an amazing game but will it ever be the free app of the day? ????????? or was it already....
B001N1DPDE|4.0|This is a great knife if you are looking for a big work-horse. It's very heavy and I have 100% confidence it will stand up to any test. I added a loop of parachord for a wrist strap just long enough that I can hold on to the very end of the pommel for good chopping action. I chopped some 2\\" caliper branches with extreme ease and shaped a spear. The edge is still as sharp as it was out-of-the-box.<br />The scales are fairly smooth and I could see that slippage may be an issue when wet but with the tight wrist strap I'm confident it won't be a problem.<br />A friend of mine wrapped his scales with parachord which looks great and feels great in the hand. But you need good size hands to really appreciate this.<br />I am unhappy with one aspect and that is the belt loop attached to the sheath. The 2nd time out in the woods the clasp ripped out of the belt loop. It was floppy to begin with and now it's just useless. The sheath itself is great and fits very snug but the belt loop is not durable. There are some good fixes that can be found on the internet but it's a shame they produced such a great heavy-duty knife and then skimped on the belt loop and clasp. Not very happy with this.<br />Also, pay attention to the recomendations from Kabar in the box... Keep the knife stored in the paper sheath and also keep it oiled. The steel and alloys used in this knife are a really good choice for the intended use but it is very suseptable to rust if you don't care for it correctly.<br />It's a great knife!
1455519006|5.0|A superb craftsman... Baldacci's \\"The Innocent\\" involves, threatens, and captures readers' attention, from the first page to the final entries. To truly care about those within the story requires wordsmithing at the highest, and Baldacci manages to accomplish such a feat. His best work, to date, and his other titles are certainly worthy, as well.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Dam I love this movie, I cannot wait for the next one. Love every twist they do with this series. What will happen next, who will be added to the line up? I'm guessing......
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love this book<br /><br />Bcbxbchxhsb heh w she have Khrushchev hfhdhdhfjfhfhfhhf JFK bond the way of doing this is not responsible for the way of doing
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Great movie super value. We need Batman in the world toy. Can't wait for the Man of Steel to come out.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Loved this book. Hard to put down! It was interesting and provocative. The ending really makes you think and you want to talk to someone who has read it.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|My recommendation everyone watch the other Marvel movies before this one. I was lost at some parts. Other than that... Very good.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I like being able to customize everything about each alarm, including the alarm itself, which I assign songs to.  I'm really able to remember the reason for the alarm, whether it's paint drying or grass growing!
B002ZCY7PU|5.0|A well written, funny and superbly acted and directed series. I recommend it to anyone who likes slapstick comedy and fun word play coupled with solid action. Plus, Sarah kicks ass.
0452289963|5.0|I find myself having to re-read certain pages over and over again to get my brain to understand what he is saying.  I think that is more about me than Tolle.  I love this book.
B003R0MF5I|5.0|I really enjoyed Chuck. The acting, the directing, the writing was all wonderful. This season was great with the exploration of relationships between all the characters.
1878424319|5.0|The writer has a uniquie style of writing that sometimes can feel like a series of long run on sentences.  The simple message however, can prove difficult to live!
B0002VFXFE|3.0|It seems to be performing adequately for my application. I had very little problem getting it out of the tube, but maybe a slightly different formulation would make that easier.
B000FC13E0|3.0|I read this novel because my son read it and like it.  The plot is clever, and has some interesting science, but the writing style is labored and not very elegant
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great series.  Seemed very realistic for the era.  Amazing how the domestic issues that occurred then continue today.  I would recommend to anyone who enjoys history and family drama.  Can't wait for season 3!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I ADORE Slammed and Point of Retreat so I was in doubt that this stand alone could be better.....<br /><br />Boy, was I WRONG!!! Colleen Hoover's writing and story lines just keep getting better.  There are more twist, turns and surprises than should be legally allowed for one book but each leaves you wanting more.  There are parts of the book that will make you cry, gasp out loud and laugh with the characters.  Her form of writing and her humor surpass that of many others before her and will continue to captivate you in Hopeless!<br /><br />The Story of Sky and Holder...the betrayal, the secrets and OMG moments will keep you hooked from the very first page.  Prepare to follow in love with the characters as you did Will and Layken in the Slammed series.  You will root for their characters, supporting them through some of life's greatest challenges.<br /><br />This is an AMAZING story....Not one of the cookie cutter stories that tend to be floating around these days...but a story about real life situations that bring attention to things that happen around us without people knowing all the time. Not your everyday boy meets girl book for sure!<br /><br />Keep the books coming Colleen Hoover! You've got superior talent over some of the competitors and I look forward to the books ahead!  Thanks for sharing your ideas and passion for writing with the world!
B00AMBH70S|4.0|This was the first time I have used Amazon for a movie rental, so My 4 stars is more about the movie than the sevice. I was disapointed with the small letterbox display and not being able to go full screen. This may have been part my fault, since I am unfamillar with the service, but the actual viewing area was vey small inside the browser window, I have a computer nooked up to my LCD TV. There were no drop outs durring viewing and picture quality was very good. I recieved the rental for free with a purchase, so the lack of control over the screen size was ok for what I paid, but I don't think I could justify paying the goning rate for this rental consideing the size of the actual movie window. It did not even go completely from side to side.
B007GE2H3G|4.0|And this came close. It owes a lot to the books with the references and plot points it takes, but - while the sequences are exciting - it over complicates the original artwork.
B00005RDRO|5.0|This movie is so funny!  So many of the actors in it have since passed, so it's great to be able to see some serious stage and screen actors play in a campy comedy!  One-liners and quick wit make this movie a must have!
B009JBZH54|5.0|An outstanding value on 3 excellent movies.  Picture and sound are excellent on all 3, as you would expect from movies made in the technological era.  Highly recommended!
B000056BOR|5.0|I purchased this DVD to replace the DVD that I lost about 8 years ago.  This movie is hilarious and it arrived in great condition and quickly.
B005LAIHY0|3.0|An okay sci-fi thriller.  I would rate this about 3½ stars actually.  Worth watching, but only one to own if you get it for a bargain price.
B009O2XY12|3.0|Good &#34;Dr. Office, need to kill time&#34; game. The higher levels are a little frustrating and I think too hard.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|A fun, exciting movie with the added benefit of blu-ray quality picture and sound.  I don't have 3D capability yet, but wanted to get this one in that format for when I do.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|If you've read either of Colleen Hoovers other books then you know she's an excellent story teller.  Hopeless just further proves that this lady has talent!  I was hooked on Hopeless from the first paragraph.  I thought I had the story figured out about half way through.  Boy, was I wrong.  Instead I got smacked upside the head with a twist I didn't see coming.  It made my brain freeze, my heart skip a beat and gave me goosebumps.  I couldn't put the book down.  I had to know how it ended.  And the hits still kept coming.  But the whole time, the characters felt real.  The story didn't seem fake or contrived.  It all felt like it fit together and was something that could have happened in real life.  And the ending was perfectly imperfect... just like real life.<br /><br />I give this book 5 stars because it deserves it.  I hope we get to see more of Sky and Holder and what their future comes to be...
B003H6KRIE|5.0|I won't review the movies, other than to say they are fantastic.  The blu-ray's have excellent picture and sound, so that makes them that much more enjoyable.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I LOVED reading all 3 of the Fifty Shades books. If you haven't read then you should. A must read.
B008602KQI|5.0|... even better book!  Love the blu-ray.  I have a big, awesome TV, and I really enjoy using it to it's fullest capabilities, which is what blu-ray is all about.
6305265666|5.0|I love this movie.  It's one of the few romances I have no problems with.  A Cinderalla a woman can be proud of.  I can't wait to share it with my girls.
B004K3R4XO|5.0|I received the product quickly and in perfect shape. I was really happy with the service and would do it again.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|I am so sad the the Maze Runner trilogy is done. They were by far some of my most favorite books. The balance between suspense, romance, action, and some horror is so well done it should intrigue most book fans. I love that it challenged my mind, but wasn't over done. I didn't have to spend all day with my head in a dictionary to get through one sentence. I more then love this trilogy.
1433502410|5.0|The English Standard Version is very akin to the NIV in that both are written in plain and theologically -correct language that conveys a non-denominational approach.<br />The Study portion clarifies and expands on individual verses and then summaries so that the reader can better aid his/she study process.  The study guide lives up to its name, it is a wonderful supporting resource to the study of God's word.<br />The ESV Study Bible is an excellent book for both the new Bible reader as well as the scholar.<br />In that it is a combination Bible and Study Guide, It's a big book, therefore, a desk book.<br />What a great resource!
B009GESJH2|4.0|This is a solid kid rock cd from front to back. He has gone totally southern rock, eliminating the tired forced hip hop element, love how he always shows the love for his hometown area in a couple songs.
B005HSG3VK|2.0|The base is flimsy and does not provide consistent support for the Kindle Fire.<br />The trifold set up has no mechanism to lock it into place.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|This is a great movie with suspense , action and excitement.<br />I am glad it was available to watch online.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Toward the bottom the items turn to a gray list. Why.<br />need more words, easy to install, fast and I needed something
B009VB9VKY|3.0|Movie was just okay. I wasn't able to get into the storyline. It got a little boring halfway through. Instant stream quality was great though.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Great movie which puts your imagination to expand its limits, definitely it merits to be seen and tasted!<br />Have a nice watching!
B007V65R54|5.0|The writer makes the arcane and tedious siene of statistical forecasting lively and informative by relating the science to real world forecasting the any reader would be familar with.
B001EJJO7Q|1.0|How dare you call this band metal. Maybe back in the day but not todays standards!<br />Only good use for this record is to play frisbee with and that's it.
B008QMMEOE|5.0|My grandson really enjoyed doing the puzzles on this game.  He wanted to get more money out of his piggy bank to purchase more puzzles to go with the game.
034580404X|5.0|The books were of excellent reading pleasure-very good! I will be recomending these to others to read! I enjoyed them all!
B0073ODRKG|5.0|Very good selection of Madonna albums at a great price.  The first four albums, Madonna, Like a Virgin, True Blue and Like A Prayer, have been remastered with additional remixes of songs from the record added to each of the four.  The one complaint is that no liner notes from any of the 18 albums is included.
B001KVZ6HK|1.0|i HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO SEE IT BECAUSE IT WON'T PLAY ON MY 3D BLUE RAY. THIS IS THE FIRST BAD PRODUCT I HAVE ORDERED FROM AMAZON. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS LOSER.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|This was the best game I have played!!  It was easy to understand, functioned well and very challanging.  I have started over several times and played it over and over again.  Well worth the money....
B00AMBM9MO|3.0|I thought I read a review by Roger Ebert that this was a really good film, but I just never got that same feeling. Mark was a nice enough guy, and Ted was absurdly crass, but I just kept thinking that their hijinks were more sad than funny. I mean, who could jeopardize their relationship by leaving a party to go to another party and expect to not be caught? The humor was more silly than genuinely funny is what it boils down to, and the relationship was as unrealistic as the talking bear.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I was hoping for the trilogy to be released in a gift set and it finally did. Didn't think twice and pre ordered it. Packaging is great and is bundled with a mini vision of the Art of Making Dark Knight Trilogy. I have the big version of the book as well, hence I found the mini version a trouble waste for those who owned it. Nevertheless, it makes an interesting read for my 11 year old son who has become a huge fan of the trilogy as well.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This is an easy to read book that gave a little insight into the life of a seal in Iraq.  Thank you to the men and women that serve in our military!
B00A23MVHA|4.0|It's a very funny movie but extremely vulgar; don't bring the kids. The humor is right out of Family Guy, which I enjoy. I would have given it five stars if they didn't curse so much.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|This was more of a Bruce Wayne movie than Batman, but it was a good movie that I really enjoyed watching.
B008Y7BE7E|4.0|It was a tad more comical than I like for a zombie movie but overall it was good. Walking Dead is way better.
B004IQMXD4|2.0|I've been a Stevie Nicks/Fleetwood Mac fan since the 4th grade in 1978 so it pains me to write this.  In short, this album is boring and over-produced. No one brought her songs alive like Lindsey Buckingham. Trite lyrics, amateurish rhymes, hackneyed themes, and quite frankly, the songs are just too long.  Stevie, you are 60-something years old, instead of writing about \\"romances\\", could you get a decent boyfriend for once and have a \\"relationship\\"?  Sorry, two stars for sentimentality's sake only. I'll listen to \\"Bella Donna\\", \\"The Wild Heart\\" or \\"Rock a Little\\" any day.  It's going back and I agree with another reviewer that it is very annoying that she keeps taking snippets from old song lyrics and inserting them into new songs, like her old fans wouldn't notice ?!?  \\"No one walks away from this battle\\"-\\"Battle of the Dragon\\" back in the 80's!
B00932ANQM|3.0|It's okay I guess. It was either this or watch reruns with my girlfried so I chose this. I wouldn't pay to watch this.
B0087HT36U|5.0|I love this  game could use some hints, but that might take some fun out it<br />Would like to see more levels ,Solid 5 stars
B008476HBM|5.0|And I've read it more than once! One of my absolute favorite books ever, such a WONDERFUL story with great characters! Definately worth the read over and over again
B00AMBH70S|3.0|It could have had more action but it wasn't a bad movie.  I like the new actor in it, it had action but I understand it needed to build the plot up and let you understand the character. Not bad just wan't my favorite but I'd watch it again.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|I know some say it's hard to read and understand which could be true. But after you get used to the way they speak the book is INCREDIBLE! My absolute most favorite book ever! I love this book! Such a sad but beautiful and touching story.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was so touching.  It had the right amount of suspense and action.  It made me want to keep reading to find out what was going to happen next.  The twist at the end makes the whole book worth while!
B008D28HYS|5.0|Great game to play. Challenging and fun. Fun for whole family. Great brain game. Addicting. Logic any reasoning game. Nice variety and increased difficulty.
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|A great office program. I use it all the time on my converted Kindle Fire. Very similar in nature to Microsoft Office.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Slammed fans will not be disappointed. This story succeeds so movingly, you don't have to be a CH fan or a young adult to appreciate it. In fact, the altruism and innocence embedded in the characterization is the book's most charming element. The H/h are the very essence of everything good that can come out of a terrible situation and your heart will bleed with compassion for them.<br /><br />The story effectively preserves the virtues and hopes of these sentimentally-strong characters, at the same time delivering a plot with so much damn backbone, you end up feeling punched in the gut with its dramatic power.<br /><br />The narration is delicate but precise. As it unfolds, you'll try to piece things together with difficulty. The anticipation is engrossing as you contemplate fate, chance, and the interwoven lives of everyone involved.<br /><br />Bottom line: This book is flawless. You won't just live it. You'll hopelessly love it.<br /><br />Note: This YA novel has three sex scenes and some might consider the subject matter and tone a bit darker than the Slammed series.
B009LK6JS2|1.0|Lousy interface, not realistic, the program crashed on it's own many times. Would not recommend it to anyone or any serious gamer.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This book was very intruiging, and I enjoyed it very much. I would reccommend this book to anyone.  it's very informed.<br /><br />JAB
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|A really enjoyable read, better and<br />more descriptive than the movie... just finishing the first book and looking<br />fwd to the next as I know it can only<br />get better.
B002N4DZ4Y|2.0|It's too bad this performance suffers from such a poor recording. Callas is wonderful, as usual, and deserves better sound in a recording.
B009E3EY4M|5.0|One word sums it up EXCELLENT ! The best rock'n'roll band ever. If you like Led Zeppelin you will like this.
1401941893|5.0|It has a beautiful message, and while other people think it's repetitive, I think she shows us how to apply the same message to every aspect of our lives. I love every part of the book, very inspiring.
0446554995|2.0|I wanted to really like this book, but I just couldn't. I was happy that Pendergast was going to be solving murders in New York with Vinnie. At least that is the impression I had reading the synopsis on the back of book..but alas that isn't really what happened. I won't go into specifics but I am sorely disappointed with the two authors and the direction they have taken with Pendergast. The last two books bored me but I keep on trying/hoping.<br /><br />This book was about 4 CDs too long. I am tired of 30 word sentences describing the sidewalk. I really don't care. The two side plots didn't have a single thing to do with the main story and shouldn't have been included. I think they were just trying to fill pages.<br /><br />But the WORST OF ALL... I began to dislike Agent Pendergast and couldn't believe the stupid things he did and the deaths he caused. It just didn't ring true for the old Pendergast. There was another \\"situation\\" that just didn't ring true, but I won't spoil it for others.<br /><br />PLEASE....TAKE PENDERGAST BACK TO THE BEGINNING. WRITE A BOOK LIKE STILL LIFE WITH CROWS OR EVEN RELIC. Those are the stories that have kept me buying audiobooks all these years. I may have read my last Preston/Child work.
B000F6YW0S|5.0|Without question, perhaps THE gold standard for the lute suites on guitar. The only player I've heard rival this is of course Barrueco, and if Su Meng continues... But this recording is a milestone in classical guitar history.
0817439390|4.0|Easy to follow, full of tips and tricks for mastering how to properly expose an image. Bryan Peterson. He makes things easy to understand for all levels. It is very insightful and easy to read for beginners like me. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in photography.
0553328255|5.0|...to make \\"I am Birdy Edwards!\\" the most shocking and thrilling moment in fiction. I've been reading these stories for most of my life, and never tire of them.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I have just finished this incredible story and my heart and head are so full, I really don't know where to begin. First, this is a story that makes you think and feel, and yes \\"Live\\". It needs to be read without knowing too much about the subject matter, so that you can really feel the story and that is what I did. I loved every aspect of the characters; along with the wit and maturity that was shown throughout this journey by each one of them. I have read both Slammed and Point of Retreat and loved them both. This story has the same intensity of love in the story of Sky and Holder, and draws you in so that you are truly vested in their future. Once you read this book, you will know that there is absolutely nothing \\"hopeless\\" about this couple. I don't know if Colleen is planning on any additional installments in this tell, but I have high hopes for this couple and the future that they have together. I would love to know more. WOW, just WOW!
0761171703|5.0|Beautiful people doing beautiful things!<br />This book demonstrates interesting settings with creative backgrounds showing dancers and their talents off stage and on
B008OOYALE|4.0|good game. the only problem is when you spend coins for a patch of expansion and then you have to spend even more coins on removing each and every scrub and it takes so much time removing them.
B00005N5S5|5.0|Terminator with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton is a classic.  It is kind of dated but it's worth watching so you know what's going on when you watch T-2 Judgment Day next.
B007TK77QE|5.0|Brilliantly penned account of small town life and politics. The teenage children of the main protagonists steal the show with their own interactional politics with their parents and fellows.
B001VLBDD0|5.0|Terminator and T-2 are classics.  T-2 is by far the better of the two.  I love the humor in this movie although it is rather violent.  It's a good story and is my favorite of this series. I think there are four now.The others are ok but this one is the best of the four.  Great sound!
B002GHIPYI|2.0|I first bought this headphones so i can show my best friend that Beats aren't the greatest thing out there and they are way overpriced. Sad to stay I wasn't able to show him that as the day I was gonna do it the whole right earbud fell off from the headband.<br /><br />When I first got the package I saw that it was really just wrap around some plastic and the cardboard holding it had placed an indentetion on the earbuds. I then notice that the Right earbud connection wasn't really correctly attached. I should of taken a picture but they are already been return.<br /><br />When I first try them on they sounded very good. Great bass and treble but the sound leaked. I was planning to use them on a rooted Galaxy Nexus with Beats Audio sound improvement and I could really hear the different from my regular earbuds.<br /><br />I have a big head and glasses but overall they didn't bother me after a long listen. I know this is a mix review but the headphones have great sound but the build quality is not great. I plan to save some money and buy me some Audio Technica.
B000VNMMWA|5.0|I was extremely satisfied with this purchase (not in a sexual way). the condition of the package was very nice, and all 3 discs provided many hours of entertainment for my companions and I. my girlfriend didn't much care for the movie, but she doesn't have the greatest taste in film. she likes shows like HIMYM and Glee and stuff like that, but apparently she doesn't like the English comedy. she didn't like shaun of the dead either. so unless its made in America or has Ewan McGregor in it, its not worth her time. but we fooled around a bit while watching it, so I was very happy I bought it.
B003L77GH4|5.0|I had heard about the Vampire Diaries but had never actually seen it before. When I was bored and wanted to watch something i decided to check out the vampire diaries and after the first episode i was hooked. I don't know much about the show since i started watching the 4th season and haven't seen any of the other seasons but from what i can tell the other seasons are just as good. I ordered season 1 and 2 and i'm still waiting for them to arrive. I literally can not stop thinking about this show that is how good it is. Its filled with drama, love, suspense, and action and it just draws the viewers in. I hope that as the show goes on the episodes get even better and i hope to see more of Elena and Damon!!!<br /><br />P.S. Go Delena!!!
B0076DELIG|4.0|I have read and enjoyed all the Harry Bosch books.  As usual this is a good dective story to read but it's not one of the best.  I would still recommend it for all Harry Bosch fans.
B007FG9LIE|3.0|One really wonders what is going on,and it leads you to keep on reading to see where it goes.<br /><br />I think the ending is lurking about mid-point, and the end is not a big surprise.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Heard a lot about it and I wanted to try it. Maybe with more practice I will get better and then it will be easier to win
B009O2XY12|2.0|This is not like the bubble game I'm used to.  Also, every time I turn around the game is wanting me to purchase, purchase, purchase.  I would not recommend this game to anyone.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|I loved all the Bourne movies, but this one was just ok. Something was missing in the story line, or it was just too long of a story for me.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|First of all, its about time a female was the hero. And she was not a sissy hero. I ahve read the other 2 books and am ambivelent about the 2nd book but the 3rd had me crying like a baby on the last 10 pages or so (don't want to spoil it, but watch for the cat at the end)
B00A6N7BS0|3.0|This movie was good at times and just ok at times. The story dragged at certain points in the movie. Overall I enjoyed it, Pulp Fiction style to the movie, not as heavy, but similar...
B00030DEQE|5.0|It meets the requirement for my software.  Installs easily.  No problem at all.  I have purchase several of these and have not had a problem.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|It was recommended by a friend.  After I added it to my tablet I shared with co-workers.  My two grand daughter really get a kick from it.
B004WDRT1Y|5.0|I loved this movie as a kid, and picked it up on a whim when it went on sale. Glad to own this fantastic BD release.
B0063IH60K|4.0|My husband thinks it's a bit too easy but he's enjoying it, he uses a stylus.  Good entertainment for him
B00917IQFY|5.0|This album captures the initial spirit of this band: excellent instrumentation covering a strong collection of new songs that will bring folks back to the &#34;Howling Wind/Heat Treatment&#34; days of this band. The basic R&B style is there and it's a refreshing feel. Graham Parker still writes sharp, insightful lyrics and the Rumours outstanding musical gifts takes this record to a Grammy level of achievement.
0062202081|5.0|First of all I am a huge fan of the Biebs! I got this from my best friend for Christmas and it was really good! I read it in less than a day because it was as if Justin was telling you a story. He poured his heart into this book and I really loved how you could feel his passion for what he does. He couldn't be more greatful for the oppritunity he has and you could really tell where his heart is by reading this. Whether or not you personally are a fan I think everyone should read this book because you will at least gain respect for him because you will know his story a bit better. This book was funny, sad, and inspiring and I would definately recommend it to everyone and I will be reading it over and over! Well done Justin, you nailed it!
B009LHWEKW|4.0|I bought it; I watched it; I liked it. The end.<br />Apparently nine more words are required for me to be able to give it 4 stars. I feel manipulated.
0756697875|5.0|I bought this for my 9 year old brother and I was very impressed with it! It shipped super quick and the graphics were AWESOME! It totally went above and beyond my expectations and it tells you about all the DC superheros not only Batman. It came with a free lego too so that was a bonus! I was just so impressed and he absolutely loved it so since my lil guy is happy, I'm more than happy:) Big sis nailed it!
0061733199|5.0|This survival manual is packed full of useful and often overlooked survival strategies.  My 11 year old can't put it down.  I might have to add it to our homeschool curriculum just to get through all of its valuable information.  It arrived in two days in excellent condition.  I highly recommend it.
B007OWRBJK|2.0|The ego of this &#34;artist&#34; is unbelievable.  According to Townshend, he was the only true contributor the the Who's success.  The rest just a bunch of yabos.  He loves telling you about all the charities he worked for and all the creative projects he worked on.  What really disappointed me was his whining about concern for money all the while traveling on the Concorde and paying for a sting of mistresses to fly on the Concorde or live in his flats.  He claimed to be a family man but blew off a wonderful relationship with his wife by philandering and staying away for blocks of time by his own choosing.  All the hedonistic excesses of a rock star reflected in this poor excuse for an autobiography.  Love the Who; can't stand the guitar player after reading this.
B00846REIS|5.0|Oh my this was a great book.  Yes some say it is just like 50 Shades of grey, but honestly I think this plot and love story is so much better than 50 shades of grey.  I hope all works out for them in the end.  She really did have a crapy child hood thanks to her step brother.  But her best friends Cary sure helps her out alot and she does the same for him.
0525425764|5.0|This is the 3rd book in the series and my 11 year old has loved them all!  We hope the series continues...  My son is 12 now...waiting for the next in the series.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I just loved this book.  I can't wait til the 3rd one comes out next year.  Wish it was this month, but too many people didn't like it when it came out on Kindle before the actual book.  So much happens to them with past and present comes to play a major role Must read
B00A0SJWQU|3.0|I liked this as an action movie, but I didn't think it was a very good movie.  The acting was only ok.  I prefer the Arnold version better.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|love this show, scary, good cast and great plot.  why am i required to write a certain amount of words.. thats stupid.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|I enjoyed this movie as an action film, but I didn't think it was as good as the original Bourne Identity series.
B004AHNIGM|5.0|Loved His new sound and can see he loves singing it, my fav cd , wore it out already n
B000002O51|5.0|Great collection of Boston songs not often heard. Especially &#34;We're Ready&#34; and &#34;Cool The Engines&#34;. A must have for true Boston fans. You won't be sorry.
B003HTPHSQ|5.0|Easy to buy this and pointed me to more music liked, . . . Put this in my top ten
0545265355|5.0|I got this set for a friend of mine for Christmas. She saw the movie, but did not read the books yet. She absolutely loved it, so I decided to buy it for myself as well. The books have nice brand new smell. Paper is of average quality (does not look bleached white, but feels solid). Good size print that is easy to read. Great content, of course!
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|My boys beg to play it all the time. My husband seems to enjoy it too as it is somewhat challenging.
B00AE2J5HI|1.0|Not a very deep plot.  Nothing but one boring scene after another just to get to the next scene of over the top gore and gratuitous violence.  Some people might think the tough guy posturing by the actors was cool but I was not impressed.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|It worked great and allowed me to connect it to my computer which makes my life so much easier. Thanks
B005RAO0GS|5.0|Powerful voice and lyrics. Great album. I really enjoy it and recommend to anyone that is a fan of female vocalists.
B008MEM24S|5.0|PURCHASED THIS GAME FOR MY SON TO PLAY ON HIS NABI 2 AND BECAME HOOKED ON IT MYSELF. REALLY FUN, JUST LIKE WHERES MY WATER WITH MORE RECOGNIZABLE CHARACTERS.
B00005JPKE|5.0|My husband has a teaching degree in history and of course loves history. We have the Flags of our Fathers DVD and thought this would be nice to own also
B0058EBNAO|5.0|This is a great intuitive weather display.  It tells you what you need to know as soon as you look at the main screen.
B006WQLH7G|4.0|No problems with this at all! But I wish it wud help my device run faster! I like avast over any other app!
B001NLKT60|4.0|I was afraid that after The Girl With the Dragon Tatoo that the author would have a hard time following up with that book.  I assumed wrong.<br /><br />Good Read, Good Characterization, Great Plot.
B009FZHYKU|3.0|So we've seen there are other groups out there surviving, all of them doing it more in Shane's style than Rick's. I think this gives us a taste of what Season 3 under Shane would have been like, only Shane could never keep his cool like the Govenor.
B005LAIHPE|4.0|The director REALLY messed up by not featuring the veterans in the awards ceremony.  Good action, good premise, fun!  Worth seeing for the Missouri scenes, but they really owed them a bit more kudos at the end it just petered out with a stupid marriage proposal.
B008YZXYY2|5.0|This is a great album. The songs are awesome, the lyrics are deep and meaningful, and the album flows really well. At first, only a few songs caught my attention, but once I sat down really *listened* to the songs, they all are wonderful.<br /><br />Can't wait for Part Two!
B008D4AKYQ|5.0|So, I don't feel compelled to write many reviews, especially not 5 star ones, but I really think this album deserved it.<br /><br />Stumbled across BBT on a Prog Mag sample disc, and found myself just playing Judas Unrepentant over and over again, so bought the CD. It did not disappoint. Favorites include The First Rebreather and A Boy In Darkness.<br /><br />As a long time prog fan (Genesis, Yes, ELP... Porcupine Tree, IQ) this album appeals for the depth of complexity and feeling in the compositions, the excellent musicianship, the broad use of brass and string instruments, and the excellent production values. If you like those bands, long song formats, something other than guitars and bass, lyrics about something besides sex and drugs, and very moving songs, I think you will like this.<br /><br />From the banjo and 'round' song format in Uncle Jack, to the jazzy, melancholy trumpet and trombone duet in Summoned By Bells, the exuberance of Judas Unrepentant, the sad and stirring strings in Boy In Darkness... Mellotron! Flute! Soaring vocal harmonies! Prog at its best!<br /><br />Incidentally, after hearing this I bought the previous CD The Underfall Yard and it is also excellent. I look forward to Electric English Part II, and to further exploring BBT's back catalogue.
B001GWK2MC|5.0|It arrived a couple days early. haven't opened it yet its a christmas gift. Will give update after christmas. giggdy
B006VFLIYK|4.0|I was surprised; it had been a while since I'd read a Baldacci book and this was very different and much better written than previous books.  The plot flowed quickly and kept me reading, although the body count rose at an alarming rate.  I like a hero who knows what he is doing and doesn't get played by a plot device any experienced reader can see through.  In this case, our hero was just a step or two behind me, but that didn't really take away from the story.  The young heroine was a bit too street savvy, but not annoyingly so.  I actually came back to see if there were any more Will Robie books in the collection; I hope there will be.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|\\"I'm vertical running! I'm vertical running!\\" Okay the Aca joke was run through and I normally do not enjoy musical type movies but... Oh. My. Heck. This was amazing. The music was incredible and beautifully sang. The humor was hilarious. And there was just enough romance. There are a few dirty jokes and the main character is obnoxiously rude sometimes but other than that it was a cute story. I don't normally hand out five stars but this was almost 'perfect' for me. You don't have to own it but I DEFINITELY recommend checking it out. I liked this movie so much, I found myself rewinding all the music parts. \\"Nailed it.\\" -fat Amy
B004TI5N38|4.0|I love Jack Reacher and I was a little worried about the reviews saying that this was basically a Reacher clone.  Yes, there are a few too many similarities between Puller and Reacher, although Puller is written to be just a little more human than Reacher.  But this is a well written book with good flow and well-developed characters...actually better, I think, than the Camel Club series.  The plot towards the end was a little too fantastic, but I didn't mind because I was well into it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It stays on even when I'm not using it. I would force stop and the program would turn itself back on. I just uninstalled it. I can view my bible thru my Kindle app.<br /><br />UPDATED REVIEW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! - The previous review was for the app on another tablet. I re-installed the app on my new tablet Aug. 2013 and I use it every day. I like the bible study plans that range from a week to a year. I set reminders to alert me to read my daily readings between certain hours so the app isn't constantly reminding me. I think this was an added feature, since I don't remember it being on the app that I downloaded in Nov 2012. If you're dedicated to reading the word everyday this is the app to use. I'm glad I gave the app another chance. The best decision I've made in a minute. :)
B009CPJHY4|3.0|DVD was sent to sister for Xmas; haven't seen it yet myself!  Have to wait for her response after holidays!
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I love it. My patterns are in PDF format and I can now take them with me with no problem.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Always a nice CD to pull out at Christmas time, my wife loves this guy and she says it is 5 stars so 5 stars it is.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Great Job Tim!  After reading the 4HWW and 4HB this was a natural selection for me.  Love the various recipes and the advice on hacking just about anything.
B00846F1YW|2.0|Game does crash after chapter 13 even after uninstall. Who can you contact?<br />To solve this problem or did I just lose the money?
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book kept my interestall the way thru, although the last quarter got stranger and stranger.  I ended up hating the main character Amy.
B0067EKY9K|5.0|&#34;Salmon Fishing in the Yemen&#34; is one of the best movies I have ever had the pleasure of seeing!!!!!!!!!!<br />I cannot say enough good stuff about this movie!  it was funny, feel good, romantic. hopeful, interesting, great<br />casting, beautiful photography and wonderful, believable content.  Call me crazy but I've seen it 8 times so far!!<br />I've recommended it to dozens of people; all who have come back and thanked me whole heartedly!
B002MFX0RQ|5.0|Harvey is a rare beast - an invisible rabbit called a &#34;pooka&#34;. In the movie one of the characters looks up the term in the dictionary and finds it defined as  &#34;A mischiveous spirit in animal form, always very large. (He) appears here and there, now and then, to this one and that one. (He is) Very fond of rumpots, crackpots, and how are you Mr. Wilson?&#34; Harvey and his best friend, Elwood P. Dowd (Jimmy Stewart) spend their days pleasantly and harmlessly enjoying themselves, generally over a martini (or often several). Unfortunately, Elwood is the only one who actually can see Harvey, making those around him doubt his sanity. Because of this, his family plans to have him committed. In the course of this undertaking, however, Harvey and Elwood, simply by being themselves, reveal to the family, their friends, and even the staff at the hospital what really constitutes a happy and fulfilling life.<br /><br />Harvey also is a rare beast because it is a spectacularly funny comedy without a hint of sexual, exploitive, or &#34;toilet&#34; humor. It is sprinkled with classic lines that become even funnier every time you hear them (&#34;Doctor, I've wrestled with reality for thirty-five years and I'm happy to say that I finally won out over it.&#34;) By the end of the movie the viewer actually comes to envy Elwood, and wish for a Harvey of their own. For those of us who do, &#34;...miracles are leaning on lampposts at Fifth and Fairfax&#34;.<br /><br />P.S. A dozen years ago, my future wife and I began dating because we both had seen (and fallen in love with) this movie. Since that time our bond to the movie as well as to each other has only grown stronger.
B000YHG72E|5.0|We loved this movie because it was funny and it personally reminds me of a family gathering we had last year at Christmas.  It's a movie for everyone!
B005ZMUWWY|5.0|I can only hold a few movies on my iPad, and this made the list. I recommend this for the kids on long trips.
B000002A46|5.0|My mom loves this CD and I got it for a GREAT deal off of Amazon. She lost her copy a while back and has been playing it NONSTOP all evening and night. She will probably play it up through New Years. I recommend!
B009SJ3GUK|1.0|this season was awful I liked last season much better. the idea of season 2 was good but didn't like the direction they took with it
B0051MKMNC|5.0|I love this movie because I love every rags to ritches story and many of us can relate to be stuck in a rut.
B003JTHWJQ|4.0|The God Delusion covers all the ground and arguments against a persistant myth, but it's too wordy and repetitive.  BUT ALL THAT SAID, I RECOMMEND IT, just be prepared to have an idea hammered to death!  Dawkins other books &#34;Magic of Reality&#34; also constantly promotes has &#34;HIS AGENDA&#34; while giving simple explanations of the wonders of reality.  Haven't read any other books, but if you have time, they are good reads.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|My friend turned me on to this book and I didn't read it for several months... I wish I hadn't waited. It will change how you think about running and eating. Christopher Mcdougall is a talented writer that intertwines facts, history and fascinating tales into an inspiring book.
B000YHG72E|5.0|I love Buddy the adopted Christmas-Elf -- a truly sweet and innocent character brought to life by the comedy genius of Will Ferrell. This movie will make you laugh and feel all warm and fuzzy inside as Buddy, seemingly the worst elf in the North Pole, finds his talent in bringing Christmas Spirit to his newly found family in New York City.
B008LV8TSU|5.0|This book is very entertaining. It's a great read if your brain needs a break from everyday life. I would definitely recommend it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love these books! Getting ready to buy the third in the trilogy and complete my set.  I recommend these books to everybody!
B000VDUWMC|3.0|The author takes an interesting approach to human history. It makes some good sense. It could be considered a racial approach to history.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love these books! Getting ready to buy the third in the trilogy and complete my set.  I recommend these books to everybody!
B001ANYDAO|4.0|This is good info. Good for advising schools and next generation planning. Asp to encourage diligence in chosen career of younger people.
B009O2XY12|5.0|This is fun and easy, my toddlers love it!!! I highly recommend this game if you want mindless entertainment for anyone.
B001AG52AG|5.0|I loved the movie, gives you hoppe, faith to keep fighting for your dreams, no matter what. thanks so much!!!!!  Lilian
B009GED3HS|4.0|This will definately have me waiting for season 9. Although the Barney/Robin relationship issue drags a bit, there are some especially memorable episodes.  Hopefully Ted will finally get to meet their mother already!
1401937519|5.0|This book is very special.  I have loaned to my friend and she agrees with me that the book is actually awesome.
B000VLE3GA|5.0|Can't believe that the songs I've been listening to since i was 10 yrs old would still be a hit now that I am 52 yrs old. Beyond compare to any rock band nowadays.  Led Zep is timeless, classic. Even their latest 2007 concert, nothing has changed. I wish i can listen & see them perform live.
1577314808|5.0|This book is very good, and has lots of useful information.  It is hard to put it down when I need to get something else done.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Enjoy playing Solitaire and will tell friends and family that it is a great game to play and very relaxing
B0083SBM7Q|5.0|Marvel's The Avengers Blue Ray/DVD Combo in DVD Packaging.  Great deal on this .  Love the super heroes, lots of action & Iron Man is great.
B002I0J5FG|5.0|Ico is not a great game. It is annoying really. Critics will call it artsy and other junk but honestly it is just catering to a princess that can't do a thing herself.<br /><br />Shadow of the Colossus, however, is an amazing game that deserves to be played by all. Giants, climbing them, stabbing them in their eyes. What more could one want?
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I had a hard time deciding whether or not to read this book because I couldn't stand the idea of children killing each other for entertainment. I finally caved and I'm so glad I did because the book was so much more than that, a definite Must Read!!!
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|Well written, unexpected. It makes you imagine the lives of each character. I always enjoy reading Jodi Picoult`s books especially My sister's keeper...
B008B68IV8|5.0|This Ghoulia is really gorgeous. I guess she is bringing her A game for her trip to Scaris. I really like the hair on this doll. It is a nice change from the regular Ghoulia style of \\"long in the back with a bang roll in front\\". The face paint on this doll is also gorgeous. I like the dark red lip, and it looks like blue eyemakeup under her glasses. I don't recall ghoulia ever wearing this color shadow before. My only complaint is that yet again Mattel has given us NO STAND with the doll. All my other dolls are on display on a bookshelf. I have been forced to buy doll stands to put these on and it bugs me that they don't match the monster high stands I already have. Oh, and no hairbrush either. Most people already have brushes they can use from other dolls, but still, just be forewarned....
B000JQUMPI|5.0|Little Women is a classic written by Louisa May Alcott about four sisters and their mother during the Civil war. I have loved this book since I was in 4th grade and continue to love it now.....I won't say how many years later. It's a great read, great descriptions of the morals and manners of the area. I would highly recommend.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|It was really great! And blew my mind watching these guys at their age being able to still jam in such a mature way.They let their music come thru! Excellent!!
B00AMBM9MO|1.0|Wish I could get my money back.<br />Trash mouth Language dumb plot.<br />Miss leading advertisement.<br />Would never recommend it to anyone.
B009K0P10K|5.0|Revenge...this is a great series. I enjoyed watching this. It had many threads that it kept you on the edge.<br />Revenge
0061122416|5.0|A coworker of mine recommended this book and I absolutely loved it. I has a great story that reveals  wonderful messages throughout the book. It is very well written as well which makes it incredibly easy to delve into.
B009LREA1S|5.0|What you would expect. Great effects, Bane is awesome, and it maintains the dark side of the previous movies with Bale. Excellent overall movie.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|It is for a Christmas gift that he requested so I know he is going to love getting it now.
B009NQKXYK|3.0|But not in my top 10 for all time movies. Interesting and plot really isn't terrible but not Oscar worthy either.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|City of bones follows a girl who gets entrapped into a world that she didn't know existed; a world full of Demons and Angels...including werewolves, vampires....etc.  A very creative endeavor which I enjoyed immensly.
1451673442|5.0|You'd think that Rhonda Byrne can't possibly top herself and yet here she is again.  Rhonda helps you to believe in yourself and how to move forward with your humdrum life and turn it into spectacular!!!  Thank you Rhonda!!  Oh by the way, great delivery, and excellent condition of book.  Thank you!!
B0035FQ1UU|5.0|Yup, this movie is terrible.  In fact, it's so bad it's good.  Really enjoyably bad.  A great movie to watch with a group.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I gave (Reflected in you) 5 stars because when I can't put a book down it deserves 5 stars! I loved to I love how the story played out for Gabriel and Eva. I found myself hurrying home so I could continue my reading. Excellent read, I reccomend it!
B00AECGQF2|1.0|ok ps kindle fire users do not buy it wont instal so dumb and i paid full price which is now up to a dollar 99
B009B50QOU|5.0|The only thing weird about this album is, it swears more then like the last 5 albums combined. And the swearing is mostly the f*** word. Still a awesome green day album
B008645YH6|5.0|Marina & the Diamonds are my new favorite artist! Marina has such a unique voice and nearly all her songs have a special meaning behind the music.
B00908DDZM|5.0|I am thoroughly pleased with this purchase. The production and lyrics are both Grade A. I rarely buy albums, but feel the need to support independent artists. Go get it!
B0063IH60K|3.0|It was ok and fun to play, but I got bored with it, deleted it and found other games to play
159448385X|1.0|I bought this as a gift since I love the book. The corners of the books were bent. I was so disappointed.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Love the Reacher series.  From the first one to the last so far, there's great page turning adventure!  There's some fairly violent parts in the series but...Reacher always wins!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This is a little bit predictable but an easy, fun read!  I loved the characters!  They were endearing - especially Megan.  I liked the Vegas setting...the book actually reminded me a lot of the movie &#34;What Happens In Vegas...&#34;  Connor (the lead male) was also a good character, struggling with his emotions and wanting a wife with no emotions involved.  I only gave it 4 stars because it was predictable.  If you are looking for a relaxing, funny read then this is it!
B004P8JPS6|5.0|Another awesome Reacher story and had the bonus with it which was great!  The Reacher novels are wild and adventurous.
B005LAIISA|4.0|Its funny!  But, my all time favorite is still Dawn of the Dinasaurs.  My babies loved it, and that makes me happy.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|Really like this accessory - gives you the ability to put all your pictures on your IPAD from you camera with ease.
B009HQ9UHC|2.0|Recently the ads have overrun this app. Ads interrupting every play make it useless now. Deleted it from my kindle. Ads aside, the game is really fun.
B0043RSK3K|3.0|I AM AN OLDER WOMAN, HAVING LIVED FOR A VERY LONG TIME, I REMEMBER IN THE FIRST GRADE WE HELD ELECTIONS FOR PRESIDENT AND I VOTED FOR EISENHOWER.  MILITARY MEN HAVE A TOP NOTCH INTEGRITY AND I TRUST THEM EVEN THEN.  I FOUND THE PREMISE OF THE BOOK TO BE INTRIGUING.  DOES HISTORY GET POLISHED AND CLEANED UP FOR CONSUMPTION  TO THE LATER GENERATIONS.  IS THE TRUTH NOT THE WHOLE STORY AS TOLD IN OUR SCHOOL BOOKS.  I HAVE YET TO COMPLETE THE ENTIRE BOOK, BUT I LIKE THE REAL UNVARNISHED TRUTH RATHER THAN A POLISHED UP HALF TRUTH. BORN NEAR THE BEGINNING OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR I HAVE SEEN NEWS AND EVENTS UNFOLD AND I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A STUDENT OF HISTORY.  SO I WILL CONTINUE TO SEARCH FOR THE ANSWERS IN THIS SERIES OF TV DOCUMENTARIES AND THE BOOK.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|I was lucky enough to see a screening the end of November. This movie is amazing and the Highlights are a great sprinkling of the show.  Director Tom Hooper said at the screening that there would be no Les Miserables without Hugh Jackman and I agree.  Hugh Jackman's voice is incredible and Russell Crowe embodies Javert.  Samantha Barks has played Eponine on the West End also and sings like an angel.  Anne Hathaway is good as Fantine (although her interpretation to me is a little too angry - it still is a great version of the song).  Eddie Redmayne was a surprise and an impressive one. He has a wonderful voice.  Amanda Seyfried sings sweetly as Cosette.<br />If you are at all interested in the movie then by this (and then buy the full version when that undoubtedly comes out too).
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I WATCH THIS SHOW ON TV AND STARTED BY COLLECTING THE FIRST SEASON.  I FIND IT SUSPENSEFUL AND INTERESTING, YOU NEVER REALLY KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT EACH EPISODE. CARRIE IS A HEROINE WITH PROBLEMS, SHE HAS SO MANY LEVELS, I FEEL FOR HER AND ENJOY THE CHARACTER'S INTERACTIONS. WORTH WATCHING IN RE-RUNS OR JUST BUY THE SERIES AND SET DOWN ON A WEEKEND AND INDULGE YOURSELF.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Everything was shipped very fast. Loved the heat sink and fitted perfectly in my pc. Keeps my pc very cool and have nothing against it.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|ENJOY WATCHING AND CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEW SEASON. IT IS BEAUTIFUL, WELL ACTED AND VERY MUCH A QUALITY DRAMA IN THE PBS/ENGLISH  TRADITION
B0006SSOHM|5.0|I love these movies. I can watch them over and over again without being bored! I highly highly recommended it!
B000MNP2KI|5.0|Great action! I love the movie. I can watch them over and over again without being bored! I highly highly recommended it!
0767817486|1.0|Extremely inaccurate representation of a country! People who have some awareness and information about the other nations will know what I mean after watching the movie!

B00AHXIC50|5.0|I don't think I am in the age range for the targeted audience for this cd.  :)  However, I absolutely loved every cut on this cd.  It is the first time I have purchased any Bruno Mars' music.  I don't think it will be my last.  My favorite songs were probably &#34;When I Was Your Man&#34;, &#34;If I Knew&#34; and &#34;Young Girls&#34;.  But, the other songs are winners, too--loved &#34;Gorilla&#34;.  I'll leave it to others who may be more knowledgeable about the minutia of making music to go into detail about this album. (Oops, cd--I'm showing my age again. Actually I downloaded the mp3.) All I can say is, I know what I like and this is definitely it.  Buy this--you won't regret it .  If you don't want to hear the &#34;f&#34; word on a couple of songs, don't buy the Explicit version.  Mr. Mars, you have a new fan.
141659521X|5.0|A year is too long to wait for Vince Flynn's next one. I Read it in 2 days. Great read!
B0064T6LV8|4.0|Graphics are realy realy good and the play is very realistic would recomend this to any one that likes pinball
B00125WAWS|4.0|I enjoyed this movie.  I like the fact that there was no cursing, or heavy sexual content; just a good movie; good content..  you don't have to trash up a movie to make it good
B00936A0ZW|5.0|Simply stunning effort from Paul and Emi. Paul is again showing them all how it is done with his guitar mastery, but I was also blown away by Emi's keyboard work. Keep it up!
B007ZI06FE|5.0|I have not read a book in ages that I have found new, exciting and fresh. This books contains it all with a combination of supernatural, romance and adventure. It is set in a gritty place called Whitechapel where no one dares to walk as it's ruled by a gang that never loses a fight. Honoria Todd lives in this town and calls it home as she struggles to make a life out of nothing. When the head of the gang Blade takes an interest in her, her life gets turned upside and inside out where lust, love and fear combine.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Once again Jack Teacher leads the reader through a spellbinding tale full of intricate twists and turns.  A very enjoyable read!
B0000714BP|5.0|This movie has been my favorite since a child! love the comedy and the acting of Swayze, snipes, and leguazamo.  Great cast and even better story!
0316010669|5.0|I just started reading the book and it has started so WELL.  Very easy to read and sucks you in immediately. would definitely recommend!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this app shows you any and every detail you may need to know. If this is having problems on your device- its your device not the app.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Really good to see a funny comedy in a book to get kids who are not big on reading, read!
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is a great app but needs to be just like the PC version. Other than that, it is great.
B005FJ7DOM|4.0|this movie laid down some great effects for such  a low budget flick. It managed to keep the gritty post vampire plague situation going well. Obviously it couldn't go into cities due to budget constrants but they cleverly made a point of saying that it was too dangerous to go into those areas anyway!. They stick to the backroads and fight plaguepires. I didn't think the movie should have called the cult group christians though. They were a group of right wing  nuts who kill people and such. THey don't act like real christians at all. They are a nasty cult like david koreshs looneys or the solar temple psychos etc. The acting is good and there's a small role for kelly migillis. She is much older now but she was the  beautiful star of the 1980's who was in top gun. This show however is a good one for it's budget in spite of the extra unneeded villians of the brotherhood. I can't imagine any group being organized that fast after such a disaster. It never happened that way in the past , and yes the world has basically collapsed and most people died a few times, like the end of the classical world or the end of the bronze age. It took centuries of recovery to gain larger areas of control. Anyways the movie is good low budget movie and it uses the natural senery to it's advantage. the blu ray has extra features and it is a very good one in clarity as this is a new movie.
B008M721MS|5.0|Love Skype! Speak with my family and friends all the time. Can't wait to use it on my Kindle! Now I'm attempting to set up my Kindle and I'm finding it's not all that user friendly!
B005K0HDGE|3.0|Good read, a little long but the research put into is great,even though I don't agree with King 's views of what happened or of the time and place
B009ERK1T0|5.0|I have listened to these guys since the onset of Nu-Metal. Thankfully Deftones barely ever fit that category. Koi No Yokan is so atmospheric and layered with so much texture you can't really categorize this album. Shoegazer?? Post rock?? Alt metal?? Yes, yes, and yes. Swerve City opens up and as one the more aggressive songs along with Leathers. Chino seems to have left his pioneering screamo back Around The Fur. Romantic Dreams has a great build up to its chorus and Tempest, the lead off single is excellent. I personally love this whole disc from front to back. Chino has excellent vocal range and Stephen Carpenter has really honed his chops with his signature 8-string ESP. Abe Cunningham is a great stick man as usual. Sergio Vega is showing why he is with the.band. Delgado adds.just the right amount of ambience. Note:.I edited this review after the passing of Chi Cheng. Great bass player and will be missed.
B006JSXYPA|5.0|I didn't have any problem with this it item. The box had the correct size and I received the item ontime
B00A3CVFMM|4.0|The only reason it's not 5 stars for me is the lack of the &#34;That's what Bilbo Baggins hates&#34; and no recording of the dwarves singing the full Lonely Mountain song. Otherwise this soundtrack is gorgeous and puts you right back in Middle Earth.
B00913DPW2|5.0|Very thought provoking.  I had to really work at this one and it was a lot of fun.  When I completed it I really wanted to play it again to find a couple of things that I missed but it wouldn't let me replay.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|As you may or may not know this book about way more than just cooking.  I'm currently using it's setup for learning Spanish and some ASL.<br /><br />If you have any inclination to be a life long learner, this is a must read book.
B0055Q5F36|1.0|i have the samsung galaxy s ii.  i ordered the CASE for the SAMSUMG GALAXY S ii.  the case will not fit.  the camera hole is turned the opposite way. i believe this product is not real, it is not an otterbox.
B005O7PXNS|5.0|Castle (and Beckett) just keep getting better and better.  Season four ends where it all has been headed - with the two stars finally coming together.  Love this show....
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I don't even know where to start.  I really didn't think it was possible for Colleen to top \\"slammed\\", but this book did it.  In fact, I'm going to say it.  This was the best book I have read all year.  Everyone needs to read this book.  I was captivated by the third page.  I couldn't put it down from the time I started until the time I finished at 2 AM last night.  The dialogue was absolutely amazing.  Holder was perfect.  Sky was perfect.  They were perfect for each other.  The subject matter was heavy at many points, but I also laughed and smiled throughout the book. I absolutely loved the banter back and forth between Sky and Holder - especially the text messages.  I think I laughed out loud (lol! - loved the fact she had no idea what that meant) during many of those exchanges. The plot wasn't predictable.  I thought I had it figured out, but I definitely didn't.  I love it when a book throws me for a loop!<br /><br />I have said before that I would read anything that Colleen Hoover writes, and now I am going to change that to I HAVE to read everything that Colleen write, and as soon as it is available!  Her writing is beautiful.  Everything Holder said in this book was absolutely exquisite - if I was a highlighting type person, I think my entire book would be highlighted.  After writing this review, I just want to go back and read it again.  Please, if you read one thing this year (or next year as this one is quickly ending) pick this book up and read it.  You will not regret it.
B004UJTG6Q|1.0|This book is not a book I can say I enjoyed. I had to read it for my high school English III class. The grammar is terrible, and the book doesn't really seem to have much of a point. It's just the story of a trouble-making country boy and his shenanigans. There is no great moral truth to be found here, no interesting story. It is a very dry and boring book, and I do not understand how it has come to be considered a classic. I think it is a terrible book.
B00009MGQL|2.0|A few decent JB licks, but the idiotic vocalizations are so distracting as to be an impediment to the whole work.  Thinking about editing out the singers.  I only wish they'd provide master copies to the customer so you could import the songs into Audacity and mute the vocals.  THEN it would be a decent listen.  Not Beck's best by FAR but if you could cut out the overly-precious Saffron, et. al. then it would be OK.
0062082353|5.0|Based on a true story of a Nave Seal sniper with more documented kills than any other military sniper in history.  Highly recommend if you enjoy military reading.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I am not much of a television viewer.....but.....WOW!  I am so glad my brother and sister-in-law got me started on Downton Abbey.  I will only be watching on DVD because it is more complete and I don't have to stop after just one hour.  Incredible production!  Dame Maggie Smith is perfection!  Entire cast is perfect for their parts.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|Bought this for a Holiday White Elephant gift, went over very well! Everything came on time and in original packaging! Very happy with my experience!
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|The Joker is what makes this movie A++++++++++.  As the movie progress there's more and more action.  Batman and Joker puts each other to the ultimate test.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Have read all Vince Flynn books and they were all great right up to the Last Man.  Looking forward to new book.
B00AE2J5HI|3.0|Movie has a great cast, however, the script could have been better for the actors.  Did not fulfill their potential as a whole.  Guy Pearce had the best role as the antagonist in the story.  Period piece was valuable to highlight the moonshine stills during Prohibition and how everyone from the gangsters to local law enforcement were fighting for a piece of the action.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|I really enjoy this app:) some people say is junk but actually is very fun if u can get into it plz no more bad reviews plus this app is made by gameloft and gameloft makes the best apps also get N.O.V.A. 3!
B002VPE1WK|4.0|I received this bag for free with my Canon T3i purchase. Months back I was looking into this bag to purchase but ended up going with the Canon bag. Now that I have both bags, I must say that this Amazon brand one greatly exceeded my expectations.<br /><br />I ended up giving it to a friend with an SLR and kept the Canon as my personal bag... mainly because all my equipment was comfortably stored away.<br /><br />Any-who, I'd recommend this bag, especially for the price.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|First off Colleen Hoover you are a Queen and deserve a crown!<br /><br />This book was an emotional roller coaster from page one.  But I lived it...and LOVED IT.<br />Towards the end I needed so many chapter breaks it wasn't even funny.  I needed drugs and alcohol and a paper bag. My stomach was in knots as the story revealed itself.  There was so many twist and turns and so many OH MY GOD shocking moments that blew me out the water.<br /><br />It will be a book that will be with me FOREVER.  The story, the feeling, the emotions.  My god it was brilliantly perfect!<br /><br />The book is pretty much yellow b/c I've highlighted everything...Every word was my favorite.  Every line was my favorite.  Every paragraph was my favorite.<br /><br />Bravo<br />Standing applause<br />You rocked it!!!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|the perfect next step for  angry birds fans, great way to pass time. these guys really do a great job w/ their games
B004ZNACA6|5.0|very good way to get all the songs in one stop shopping, will need  to get cases to protect cds
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love this game. I have hours of fun. Game loads well. Would suggest this game to others to play. Always will love this game.
0316056863|2.0|This book disappointed me because of the language and the sick humor.<br /><br />  I read the large print version and was appalled by the author's mention on page 214 of \\"sexy child murders in Miami\\".  Then the author repeated the same phrase on page 241.  How can one use the word \\"sexy\\" to modify/describe child murders?  The news media was full of the sad news from Newtown, Connecticut while I was reading this book.<br /><br />  The author is a great commedienne on television, but my opinion is based on watching her only on network channels.  Her impression of Sarah Palin was extremely good, and her facial expressions and timing show her talent for comedy.<br /><br />  Do publishers today require an author to assault their writing with f-bombs?  There are many readers who do NOT like that kind of language.
B000VUCIZE|4.0|I would have liked to give this book five stars but could not because I felt that he was not quite fair or objective about the Moslem World. Still, his presentation about the irrational positions taken in general by organized religion seems to me to be quite valid. I wish he were able to be more compassionate. Still, I do recommend this book to anyone who wants to see a world governed by reason.
B0076DELIG|4.0|I've read the entire Harry Bosch series and this book does not disappoint.  It's been a while, and maybe it's me but the whole tone seemed a bit more mellow, although Harry is still a dog with a bone.  The only thing that jarred was his seemingly perfect daughter Maddy; I am not looking forward to the possibility of having her join forces with Dad.  Other than that, a good read for anyone who knows the series.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Good writing, good acting, and good directing makes everything work perfectly with a pacing to be envied in this pinnacle of Marvel match up movies. CGI Hulk wasn't the best actor on the screen and &#34;Puny God&#34;, wasn't the best line in the film but the scene development and delivery sure made that moment the most memorable and hilarious of the film. I loved it.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game, both me and my 5 year old son are completely addicted to it and play it all the time. The biggest problem with the game is the glitch that keeps randomely resetting my account!! My high score stays but everything else is gone- all coins, all missions, all power-ups, all charecters bought, all completely GONE! It's done that 3 times now and I'm really getting sick of starting over from the beginning every time. Would be a perfect game if not for the glitch :(
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|The acting is incredible and it borrows horror elements from other series and movies, including music. Most of what you see is based on true stories but then fictionalized.
B000FC0ZEO|5.0|Enjoyed it.  It was a good ending to the set of three books,  It also tied the Liveship books in to the story
B0002E5O9G|3.0|Not sure if this is the original CD the cover looks suspicious.  I bought it for a gift so did not open it.
B005LJETYI|3.0|Premise was cool, but got pretty muddled pretty fast. Read like a rushed translation of an anime movie. Maybe that's the point...
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Prehaps the best game of all time,  Jetpack Joyride is up on the pedestal  with Angry Birds,  Doodle Jump,  Where's My Water?, and Fruit Ninja!
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|The plot was totally stupid.  The profanity didn't help to make it funny.  No, I wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy.
B008YW5RH2|5.0|Not too easy but not too hard! :-)<br />Can Play all four Grand Slams -- Austrailian Open ~ French Open ~ Wimbledon Championships ~ U.S. Open<br />Can be Isner,  Serena,  Fed,  and the Djoker + many more!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|this game is so addicting.  thought I would give it a try when I saw it. so glad I did!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Great app.  This app provides the user with a ton of stats to help determine battery health and remaining charge (for all types of usage).
B0042U94UQ|5.0|great movie, I love this I bought it for my grandchildren for christmas to put in their stockings stuffer yeah
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I have played Mahjong on my computer for years.  It is great to have it on my Kindle Fire.  It is a game you just want to keep on playing for hours.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|A little slow at the beginning, but the last third kept me up all night!  very much worth the read.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love playing spider.  This is a great game.  I would recommend it to everyone.  Once you start playing this game you won't want to put it down.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|This app is for real gamers some of the games I just don't get... but helps me by pass time when I'm really bored somewhere.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who would like insight to how well organized  and professional the Seals are.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Great story.  Grisham at his best. Awesome story and plot. That is why he is one of my favorite authors
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is a fun game and it is hard to stop playing it.  I rated it 5 stars and would recommend to everyone.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I bought this over Thanksgiving to entertain myself whilst with friend's family.  It was a good distraction, and better than I expected to be!  I ran my Kindle out of battery, and wanted more!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|This game is too much fun.  It is very hard to stop playing it.  Everyone should love playing this game.
B005KPDAN4|5.0|I love House.  One of my all time favorites!  It's a shame that it's over, but if you've not seen them all finish them!  They wrapped the series up so well.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I watched this movie with my daughter and husband and we all really enjoyed it. One of the best animated movies that I have ever watched. Not only is it lots of fun but it has a wonderful message for young girls. Every family should watch this movie!
B008764ZQ4|5.0|Great soundtrack for a great show.  Truly enjoyed the movie, and I was so excited to find that the actors/actresses sang these songs.  Often you find soundtracks that weren't even a part of the show.  This one is a great one!
B000FA5SMK|5.0|Plum Island Adventure  A marvelous tle of intrigue and misdirection.  A hard to love hero.  Gripping!  Can't put it down.. Bravo!
B008B68IUY|5.0|We had never seen this in the store.  My daughter loves Monster High, Paris, and Purple so I got it for her for Christmas.  Not a terrible price (I got it for $25), considering you can't find Draculaura's car for under $50 right now.  She is going to flip :)
B00AB0AXU6|4.0|This movie draws on a lot of the past movies with not a lot of new original script. Alice is basically stuck in game world after being captured. There really isn't a lot of new script in this movie. Just like the Underworld movies they add a child to this sequel. There is also a new creature to fight who looks like the source of these zombie people much like the Alien and Predator series. The guy with the big hammer returns briefly but that's just a few minutes of the movie. I was really hoping for a better sequel. In any case, makes a good rental but unless your collecting for the trilogy then you could pass. Hopefully, the next one will be better tying it all together because this movie was more like a filler. It might have been better to just make a 3 hour movie and put everything together (past, present and future) so it can make sense.This is a must rent before buy movie. This movie is more like 3 1/2 stars on the 5 scale.
B005XLN97M|4.0|Great smaller barbie house, got on a lightning deal for $20 so perfect price.  As will all Barbie stuff, plasticky and overpriced if you are paying full price.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Continued a great tradition with new birds, scenes, and challenges. Absorbing and fun experience. I am looking forward to more levels and new characters.
B005K17RU0|3.0|It's ok.  The app force closes at times, and the weather is not always accurate.  At least I can get an idea of if it is raining or not.  Sometimes.
B008JAG2AA|1.0|probably one of the worst sequels i've ever seen, and that includes the straight to video american pie movies. it was nice to have all the original characters back but without a storyline beyond 'remember the time' story, it simply amounts to 2 hours i'll never get back.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Does what it is supposed to do. I love that it has dual settings. Also a nice feature is how it counts down in hrs and min the time left before your alarm will sound off.
B009X01FJS|3.0|Well, I have to say I am pretty disappointed in this cover. I used a coupon for it so I don't want to return it and pay even more for a different case. $55? For a CASE? Jeez. So my first problem with this case....the price. The leather quality is good, but it's simply not worth that. Unfortunately with a new product you are limited on cases for a while.<br /><br />Biggest problem: the viewing angles. Even at the widest angle, I find it barely tolerable to watch movies, or anything really, on the Fire. My biggest use for a standing case is on an airplane or at a table, where the screen is fairly close to my body. I wish the case tilted more to give a better angle. It is ok in portrait view, but in landscape? Forget about it. I have a case on my Motorola Xoom that allows a much better viewing angle and it much more comfortable to watch things on.<br /><br />Second problem: It's thick. VERY thick, and heavy. It nearly doubles the weight of the Fire. Yes, it does seem like it will protect very well, but the cover is just a little too padded for me. I feel like I have a giant first-gen device in my bag instead of a svelte new Kindle Fire HD.<br /><br />Third problem: The ports/the magnet for auto screen off. When in the default position, the ports to charge it are covered up but the case so it must be open to charge. \\"But WAIT!\\" you are thinking. \\"Read the other reviews!\\" you are saying. \\"The case turns around! The holster turns 180 degrees!\\" Yes, it does turn around so you can access the ports, and that's awesome. But there is a HUGE, HUGE problem (gaping hole, Marware!) The magnets in the case are only oriented to work for auto on/off when the Fire is turned in the default \\"correct\\" position! So I have to constantly turn my Fire around and around, or choose what is more important....charging or auto on/off.<br /><br />Marware, I did not pay $55 for this case with the expectation of it being anything other than perfect. Such a gaping hole in something so simple (addingmagnets to two positions so auto on/off works all the time) is a huge oversight. The poor viewing angle is a part of the design, and so is the weight of the cover. It's obviously not the right one for me. But is there anything better? The Amazon case is a bit strange and doesn't sit up well for viewing. The Otterbox case is insanely expensive and heavy. The Marware MicroShell is nice and thin, but only has one viewing angle and no auto/on off. The Belkin and Crown cases have an ugly bezel cover. The only one with any potential is the Marware Vibe. I may order that one to try it out, but then I will be disappointed to lose the revolving feature.<br /><br />Too bad, Marware. An expensive case that still doesn't hit the mark. I'm disappointed I wasted a coupon on this.
