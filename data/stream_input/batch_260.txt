B000069HKH|5.0|His music/songs/voice are inspiring and several of them got stuck in my head. All of them are worth a listen. Compared to what I listened to like Creed, Nickelback, Puddle of Mudd, Incubus etc., Bruce Springsteen has the best voice/lyrics/songs. Calming on a relaxing day whether I am sad, having a bad day, positive on life in general, or whatever mood I'm in. I preferred investing in the cd than downloading the music.
0061020710|5.0|Pratchett creates a world, a planet, which is a disc, unlike our globe. And a disc, as we know, has an end, an Edge. So what happens when you reach this Rim? The universe continues, but this planet ends--in a Rimfall (a waterfall) that falls over the edge of the planet into space. Obviously few have ventured over the Edge. This discworld, then, has to be supported somehow, it doesn't just float; it is held up by four gigantic elephants, who in turn stand on Great A'Tuin the Turtle, with sea-sized eyes and a brain as big as a city, who swims slowly through the interstellar gulf, to where, many intelligent people on the disc are trying to find out. And one of the biggest puzzles about this turtle is its gender--nobody yet knows. But they're trying to discover this by sending out spaceships over the Edge.<br />If all that sounds too absurd to stomach, the story isn't. As you read, you discover this world, and learn the rules (which are rather few in number), for example, that Death Himself comes to claim a wizard, instead of sending one of his subordinates like He does for other lower people. And our main character is a wizard, 'sort of,' since he was chucked out his school of magic for stealing one of the great spells. His name is Rincewind. And there's the tourist, Twoflower from a different world, with his Luggage which follows him anywhere and everywhere with its 'hundreds of legs.' <br />This first book is the adventure of Twoflower with poor Rincewind taking him around for a daily wage of 1 Rhinu (an unimaginably big sum for anyone in Ankh-Morpork, leave alone an expelled wizard). Of course, not even many more Rhinus a day would have tempted the wizard to this adventure had he known the dangers and close shaves with Death that it involved!<br />The book opens up your brain to new ways of thinking and makes you laugh out loud with Pratchett's terrific sense of humour. It seems there are twenty-five more books in the series. I think I'm going to read quite a few ofthose.
B00005O3VC|5.0|Each time I watch that movie these new jokes COme out at me each time I see it. Hidden treasures a little over rated but worth it. Go out and buy it now.
B000063US7|5.0|Despite the unbelievable price that Amazon wants, the quality of the DVD is amazing and Genesis did a fabulous job with this tour.  The big screens are unbelievable and state of the art as usual. ... Amazon, you seriously need to fix your pricing!
B00005JKDR|5.0|Perfect for parents who want to sit thru their kids' movies without throwing up. A visual and aural treat for everyone. Visit a world where monsters are just as scared of kids, and are just trying to keep the lights on in their world by eliciting screams from the little ones. clocks in at a brief 1:25, but has nearly three hours of special features. You people who want to be critical of this movie and others of its kind should go soak your heads-you watch too many movies, and it's getting to you. Find another hobby.
B000001EHS|4.0|All I can say is that, even after owning this for several years, this is still one of my favorite compilation albums by one of my all time favorite bands.  Just about every one of these songs is a classic.  I would have given it a 5 star rating had it not been for the inclusion of a couple of really lousy songs, &quot;When Love &amp; Hate Collide&quot; and &quot;Miss You In A Heartbeat&quot;, but the rest of them are first rate songs.
0064407667|1.0|As a teacher, I have read this for a book group run in my district.  Normally I look forward to reading these books.  I was frankly disgusted from beginning to end.  From the moment the parents burn to death in their house, to the irritatingly intrusive explanations of words, I was completely turned off.  I was further disturbed to see the sexual overtones of the cousin, assigned to raise the children, devise a plan to marry the oldest girl (still a young teen) for their fortune.  When the plan is foiled the cousin steals the youngest and threatens to drop her from a great height!  I looked on [online store] to find out why kids liked it and was completely confounded by the amount of adults who thought this book clever!  I hope parents read this review.  It has too many mature themes for 4th graders and is too young for teens.  I can't see in what age group this fits.  I have an open mind when it comes to books, but I implore you to choose something else to read!
0375703764|5.0|Mark Danielewski's HOUSE OF LEAVES is, without a doubt, a singularly odd & purely Post Modernist literary construction; its narrative framed several times over in the most disconcerting manner, its matter of subject demented. Satirizing - among many other targets - academia, the literary canon, pop culture & even ITSELF at times, HOUSE OF LEAVES is a genre defiant work of genius which refuses to be categorized. I can't understand what audience it could have been crafted for - I searched all over for Oprah's label but couldn't find it - & can only assume that it was written with no specific audience in mind at all. How could there have been? There's no central story, no true protagonist in any definitive sense of the word, & no happy ending. The character of Zampano is dead when we meet him, Johnny is on his way, and Navidson, though not dead, comes out of the thing more mangled than even Bronte's Rochester at the end of JANE EYRE. No, the larger lessons of HOUSE OF LEAVES lie in the fact that its story, or rather, stories - are accessible to all, even if we can't exactly relate to all the technicalities involved. Even the densest reader cannot help but be drawn along for the ride, & acutely feel each & every one of the dips & turns the narrators of the novel feel.<br />Much ado is made over the shapes of different poems & how clever their creators are. George Bernard Shaw spaces out a few words in HEARTBREAK HOUSE for emphasis & the world goes mad. Danielewski arranges his words to tease, frustrate - to communicate the experiences his characters are experiencing. To take us out of the theater & make us active participators in the act. Under Daniewlewski's masterful manipulation, as I read, I sunk ever more into his text, falling when he wanted me to, my eyes narrowing in on passages as ordered to or skittering nervously across the page looking for a word that wasn't where it was supposed to be. I generally clip through novels at a very fast rate, yet the way the text was arranged kept me from flying through the story. Instead, I was forced to go as fast or slow as Danielewski wished, often having to twist the book or myself to get to the next word, nearly doubling myself over as I flipped through pages with one word on them, sometimes even further contorting myself to read things printed upside down or backwards. There came a time when, save for page numbers, I wasn't sure whether I held the book upside or down! Before this novel, I never thought there would BE a time when I would have to wonder. Words printed in claustrophobic little boxes had me breathing shallowly & then sighing in relief when the box widened out. Though only the word 'house' was blue, I began seeing traces of the color throughout the text, on other words, & I'd stare at them a few seconds, blink, & then wait until they readjusted to their proper black & white.<br />HOUSE OF LEAVES is a powerful work which effects you while you're reading it, but more importantly, its lessons & piquancy stay with you even after you've turned the last page. A must read which begs inclusion in every library.
B00005JKHP|5.0|I love the Star Trek: The Motion Picture Director's Edition DVD! I was really late in getting this DVD movie because I didn't have enough money to buy it when it first came out last year. But when I purchased it at Blockbuster, I was amazed by the enhanced version of this old film. Star Trek The Motion Picture DVD Disc 1 has some very impressive enhanced special effects. the Conmentary is by Robert Wise and Text Commentary is by Micheal Okuda! This movie is just as good now as it was in 1979!  The Disc 2 features some additional material related to the movie. It has doctumentaries, additional and deleted scenes, story board archives, T V spots and Movie trailers. Disc 2 also has an &quot;Enterprise&quot; promo on it. This is a wonderful Star Trek DVD to add to your collection!  Buy it! Highest Possible Reccomendation!
0380977788|3.0|Coraline is a misunderstood and ignored girl, who's parents are preoccupied with computers and recipes, and who's neighbors unfailingly call her \\"Caroline\\" despite her corrections.  Strange dreams and messages from her neighbors mouse circus hint at a coming change.  And in the fashion of Wonderland and My Neighbor Totoro Coraline stumbles across a doorway to another flat in her building, which leads, not to cute fuzzy creatures or wonderland, but to a parallel world with a second set of parents and neighbors, all distinguishable by the black buttons sewn over their eyes.<BR>Opening the door gives Coraline's parallel \\"other\\" mother the opportunity to kidnap her real parents.  Coraline challenges her \\"other\\" mother to a game in which Coraline has to find her parents, as well as the souls of three children trapped in the parallel world.<BR>The imagery is frightening and imaginative, and Gaiman, not surprisingly, is fantastic at beautiful dream like sequences that sort of transcend conventional plot.  The things happening in this parallel world are beautifully absurd and confusing, and fully appropriate for this story.<BR>Those being his strengths, there is one major weakness.  One quality I always look for in a good childrens book is an author that doesn't talk down at children.  As in, the language is not obviously simplified.  Unfortunately some fantastically imaginitive stories tend to lay everything out far to easily, and explain everything fully.  In Coraline the climax of the story is fantastic, despite the reader knowing the thoughts of every character.  Coraline's plot is well seen and easy to understand given her actions alone, making further description and explanation extraneous.<BR>This is not just a problem in the end of the book, but throughout thoughts and feelings are clearly marked and defined, and despite popular belief, children don't need these things pointed out.<BR>What remains despite all that is still a really great and scary story, and a fun read.  Well worth a look if you're in for a good children's scary story.
0380977788|5.0|Coraline was the third book I read by Neil Gaiman, not counting his groundbreaking Sandman comic book series, and it's the one that sold me on his status as one of the best emerging writers around.  Without spoiling anything by giving away details, Gaiman has written a book that reminds us that there were things behind closet doors and such when we were young that we simply have forgotten were there.  Some of the best prose writers are those who can set a scene and create vivid images without taking thousands of pages to do it, and Coraline makes use of every word.  At the end of the day, Coraline reminds us that we haven't banished the creepy things from our childhood closets, we've just buried them as best we can.  No author I know of is better at describing the world between waking and sleeping than Gaiman, and  Coraline proves he knows plenty of innovative ways of going about it.
B000067CPX|5.0|The greatest thing music can do for us is grow with us.  For those of us who have shared memories with these bands that have been around for the past 20-25 years, the maturing of our musical tastes is as inevitable as growing older.  How wonderful it is to have artists in our lives like Santana, U2, and now the Red Hot Chili Peppers who grow along with us.  BY THE WAY is by far the most mature album RHCP has ever produced, and like us they have all gone through a lot of growing pains to get here.
B00005RYL2|5.0|This, the first movie of the whole Highlander saga is one of my favourite movies simply because of it's originality and style. True, the Highlander franchise is knocked quite a bit because of the ridiculous and confusing sequels, along with a rather contradictory tv series. However, no one can say that the idea of Highlander is a copy of something else(i.e a copy of something more successful), it definetely stands on it's own. I just think that things messed up more and more after every sequel, they simply didn't continue after each other like they should have and the arrival of the tv series probably made things worse rather than better. Though I can't comment too much on the series, the fact is that Connor Macleod(Christopher Lambert) was apparently the last immortal, he was the one and he claimed the prize. Then theres another Macleod and much more immortals around in the series. I know there are sometimes different laws for movie tv spin-offs, but it just didn't help that the movie's sequels seemed to have their own laws as well i.e H2 being set in the future and immortals being aliens,H3 being set in the present again and the latest one only having a slight connection with the original movie, totally ignoring 2 and 3 and bringing the tv series cast along for the ride. Though at the end of the day, they all simply ignore each other, thus causing a lot of head scratching for the viewer. Therefore, my point is that they should have left Highlander as a stand alone movie, without any sequels or any tv series. In my opinion, the first movie is unique and probably would have been much more unique had it been left alone. True it is a rather dated feature film now, but I can't help thinking that this movie would have been much more respected and even more popular had it been left at one movie and without all the silly, confusing sequels. The producers should have followed their well known catchphrase, THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE!
0316666343|1.0|My perception of a book is to somehow enrich experience during and after the process of reading. I felt robbed of every moment spent to finish the book for the sake of finishing it. I found her characters flat, the plot typical, and the sub-plots Charles Dickens at best. Moreover, there were moments when the writing made me cringe and embarrassed for the writer. I realize this is a harsh criticsm but I felt annoyed at the loss of time spent reading this book. The only thing lovely about this book, indeed, are its bones, that is, the catchy cover.
B00006AG5N|5.0|Well, you all know what Elvis sounds like.  (\\"I don't sound like nobody.\\")  The variety of styles, the hugely impressive voice, the sparks of creativity and originality, the groundbreaking music.  Most potential buyers, I would guess, want to know how the sound is of the music they know so well.  It's superb, the best I've ever heard.  It puts the boxed sets and the ... \\"50 Worldwide Gold Hits\\" to shame.  Truly fine sound.  So, if you're an Elvis fan, I'd say get this even if you have all these songs (and you don't, because of that clever remix version at the end).  You might be surprised at just how clear the sound is.  It's like hearing them all over again.  Highly recommended.
B000063DGC|5.0|The Ozzy Osbourne Randy Rhodes TRIBUTE CD rocks!  The tracks have been digitaly remastered and sound so good on modern audio equipment.  It is sad to think of what Ozzy's place in rock would be if he and Rhodes could have recorded 5-10 more albums in the last 15 years...  Ozzy has done well for himself with one or two quality albums (No More Tears and Ozzmossis) are really the only solid studio releases since Diary of a Madman...<br />...<br />It is a good CD though... ...
B000002MP2|4.0|Dookie is one of the best Green Day CD's ever made! My favorite songs on it are: Basket Case and F.O.D.  GET THIS NOW!!!
B00003W8NM|5.0|I say this because this movie is really really good and there isn't any other movie like it. This movie is 99% perfect. The only minor flaw is the very end, it's kinda unrealistic. You'll kow what I mean when you see it. And the movie is making a good point. Brad Pitt, Edward Norton, and Helena Bonham Carter are perfect for their roles. This movie is in at least the top 3 of my own personal best movie list. I don't wan't to ruin anything about the movie so i won't say anything else.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|It's definitely one of the best animated features of all time. I mean it was nominated for a Best Picture Oscar that it really deserved! An Enchanting tale, catchy songs, magnificent scenes, and a whole line of lovable timeless characters. Also one of Disney's biggest box-office hits, Beauty and the Beast is loved by both children and adults. Just like \\"Snow white and the 7 dwarfs\\" it deserves to be in all-time great lists and just like \\"The Lion King\\" it deserves to be a top 10 Box-Office Hit! Thing is this feature is even better on Imax. Imagine a 3-D (almost Monsters Inc. type) Beauty and the Beast film. The whole saga is made to fall in love with. If you don't enjoy the story, you'll enjoy the songs at least. If you hate the songs you'll love the characters- and so on! It's like the classical Disney cartoons- funny but moving. It's sad but at the same time suspenseful. Beauty and the Beast is definitely one of my all-time favourite films. Boy can the singers sing! And the OST LP? Boy-just listen to Celine Dion's serene voice in the title track! Words fail me (in the good way). It's timeless- it's a perfect masterpiece. If you loved the Lion King, you'll love this. It's a treat to watch it again on the big screen! Even with all the computerized animated features collecting big bucks at the Box-office- Beauty and the Beast stands high above all others. <br />    The story revolves around a cold-hearted prince who refuses to help a fairy disguised as an old woman. As a result the fairy turns the prince into an ugly beast lost forever in his 'magical' castle where the rose petals count the days until he finally dies unless someone can fall in love with him as a beast. Then the story starts with Belle- a sweet lovable character that loves to read and sing. The film introduces all the characters as they show Belle's father arriving at the Beast's castle for help and Belle going on a 'mission' to save her dear old daddy. This isn't a spoiler so I won't tell you the rest! In short the main question is, can Belle actually fall in love in the ruthless Beast?<br />    It's worth the purchase because it's a magnificent musical, a spectacular show, it has comedic characters, and it's overall a fantastic feature!
B00005JL3A|3.0|Torn. Yes, this is how I was left feeling when the move came to a close. Let me explain:<br />  I was filled with much anticipation & excitement hearing of<br />this action-packed/sci-fi starring two female roles: Milla Jovovich & my new found favorite, Michelle Rodriguez(Girlfight). I have followed Milla's early modeling career back when she graced the covers of Nov & Dec '89 issues of Seventeen Mag up until her movie career. She has played a variety of charectors far from her 'model persona'. But to put her in a flimsy red dress & black leather boots to fight off something capable of destroying mankind? It strays away from her role as Alice, a strong member of a covert security team which she specializes in<br />hand-to-hand combat, not to mention martial arts skills assured to leave any 'livingdead' DEAD. I'm sure they thought a slight peep of her thighs would keep our attention. What they don't realise it's those rediculous decisions that make a film flop. Milla took what she was given & did the best she could: to [beat down]& look cute.<br />  Then there's Michelle Rodriguez. She rightfully is dressed the part of a commando. 1st class to be exact. No frills and she does not need any. She has a certain mystique and charisma that no lipstick or fancy wardrobe could come close to.<br />  Although I believe the script was poorly written and we, the audience, were not fully introduced to the charectors as individuals, I truly feel the actors put all they could in this film.<br />  Oh yeah, it scared the hell outta me, and the soundtrack was great. The fight scenes left me at the edge of my seat.<br />Maybe someday we can have it all in an action or sci-fi: great writing, well rounded plot, interesting charectors, & most of all, leading ladies getting the job done and takin' names later.
B00006AG5N|5.0|This is a terrific CD.  31 of Presley's greatest hits are included on this collection.  The sound is crisp and pure and the selection of songs is really great.  Everything from his early stuff (Hound Dog, Don't Be Cruel) to his hits in the early 70's (Burning Love, In the Ghetto) is included.  A great example of his gospel prowess, Crying in the Chapel, made the list as did his last #1 hit from this past summer, A Little Less Conversation, which reached hit status after Nike included it in a soccer commercial last year. It is the 31st song on the CD. The songs were re-mastered and you can hear it on this disc.  The sound is wonderful with Elvis sounding as good as he ever did.  The thing to remember about Presley is not his string of films in the 60's- most of which don't deserve remembering- but his great voice and the power he could bring to a song.  He is responsible for moving rock and roll smack into the middle of America.  The cuts on this album are representative of his career and though one could argue here and there about some songs that were missed, it still is a great addition to anyone's collection who is an Elvis fan, or just a fan of rock and roll.  This CD, much like the Beatles 30 collection, belongs in everyone's music library.
B00003CXAY|5.0|Although some people are quick to point out that the MGM version of Koyaanisqatsi is improperly matted to 1.85:1, who really cares? If you are a fan of the 'qatsi films, then you are well aware that they have been out of print (unavailable to the public for purchase or even rental) for a LONG time. I have long been trying to obtain a bootleg, or even laserdisc copy of the films. On ebay they usually went for upwards of $100 a copy. When I heard that MGM was releasing the films on DVD, I was estatic, and after watching them at home on my TV, I am even more happy.<br />Koyaanisqatsi is a love-hate film; you either love it, or hate it. For me, the brillance of Koyaanisqatsi comes in the juxtaposition of it's imagery and film score. The imagery is stunning: beautiful yet disturbing at times. The filmmaker Godfrey Reggio gives the viewer imagery and lets them make their own decisions about \\"what it means.\\" This renders Koyannisqatsi a film where the viewer is quite active. If you do not like to think, or do not like abstractions you will most definitely not enjoy these films. If you enjoy thinking, and want to watch an experimental film that will leave you thinking for weeks, if not months afterwards, I can't recommend this film more.
0060392886|5.0|This book is one of those that you just can not put down because you are so excited to read what crazy thing they did next.  I love this book!!!
B00003CXI1|3.0|Casting: A+<BR>Set Design: A<BR>Special Effects: B<BR>Story Adaptation: C+<br />My problem with this movie is that it's far too rigidly literal to the books, and hence it suffers as a film (even though the book is wonderful). It's well-documented that Miss Rowling had a very strong presence during the making of the movie, and I do think that Chris Columbus, a competent director, let himself be intimidated and stifled by it. There's virtually no trace of his creative hand that's visible in the film. I could practically hear the pages of the book being read verbatim. &quot;And then they went here, and then they did this, and then this happens...&quot;<br />On the good side, the actors are really excellent and everything looks exactly right. The special effects were not up to par on a film costing this much money. It's actually a pretty good movie, I just wish the filmmakers had taken a few liberties in order to make it better. As a children's movie, it probably gets four to five stars, as I'm sure they will love it. But I have to be honest and review it from my own adult perspective. There's at least a few more movies to go, so here's hoping they get it right next time!
B00003CXDD|4.0|Great movie.  It was way ahead of its time, it still stands up today.  Great story and effects.  The DVD, along with its other features, has the best behind the scenes making-of video I have ever seen.  It really showed how Lucas works with his directors.
0743216458|1.0|I'll hand it to Ambrose....this is a pretty good book. I don't think a hundred books about small units of the 101st and 82nd could really ever get me there, but \\"Band of Brothers\\" is a decent attempt. A semi-personal account such as this is pretty entertaining, but for a gut feel of what it is like up close, read Donald Burgett's excellent set or my personal favorite, the unparalleled \\"Those Devils In Baggy Pants\\" by the late Ross S. Carter.
B00003CXXP|1.0|This was a train wreck of a movie.  It started ok, was visualy stunning, and then it just went South.  And having gone south I know now why so little lives in Antarctica.  It is 3 hours of my life I want back.  Aside from some really neat visuals, decent acting, and good directing the story left everything to be desired.  And as bad as the middle part of the movie was, the ending made me want to take back my DVD player.  Not only did I feel cheated, slack-jawed, and wonder what kind of substance the great S.S. was taking when he thought that end was a good idea, I felt down right dirty.  In short, extreamly slow meandering plot with a confusing, &quot;pull this out from where the sun don't shine because I have no idea how to wrap this up&quot; ending.
B000005HLV|3.0|A confession: I'm an old guy (I'm 35) who's been into the underground metal scene since the early '80's, and to me &quot;black metal&quot; was Bathory, Celtic Frost, Hellhammer...that kinda thing. It's only in the last couple of years that I've really gotten into the northern European bands (although I've ALWAYS worshipped Bathory), and while I've generally been blown away by almost everything I've experienced so far (Emperor, early Burzum, Enslaved, Immortal, etc.), frankly, I just cannot bring myself to take Mayhem seriously.<br />Try as I might, I simply can't help but believe that this band's revered status is based solely on their notorious reputation and history, which to me often reads like a really bad movie script. Because when viewed objectively, 'De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas' offers nothing particularly special. While the music is brutally sick, fast, and heavy, it's nothing you haven't heard done much better by other bands to follow in their wake, and the absolutely silly vocals are so bad as to be borderline unlistenable...like a talentless drunk at the bar on karaoke night. Don't get me wrong, this isn't really a bad album per se, I just don't think it's a very good representation of what modern black metal has to offer.<br />I'm sure many black metal aficionados would argue that this disc demands inclusion in your collection for it's historical value alone...I would simply counter that by saying that I buy albums based on their merits and not their reputation. If you're a relative neophyte to this genre, I really would not recommend you starting off here.
B000063UR2|3.0|It's always been a bit campy, but then what fantasy isn't.  It is still fun, Tim Curry's &quot;Dark&quot; is still one of my favorite villians of all time (next to Darth Vader, Hannible Lector), and being able to see the director's was great( seeing it on TV and then on video I always was waiting for seens that I'd seen before, but weren't.  The director's cut had them all and more).
B00006AFUR|5.0|This is a fantastic CD.  I find hints of Queensryche everywhere while listening to it.  There was obviously a LOT of time and care taken into this CD.  You won't be dissapointed!
B00005V3Z4|2.0|I can't say I loved, or even liked this movie right after I saw it.  In my book it committed the cardinal sin of movies and dragged.  Right in the middle it just seemed to be going slower than a dead snail on a salted sidewalk.  It was extremely creative and imaginative, and defiantly one of those movies you will be discussing with friends after seeing it.  The end really threw me.  I didn't see it coming at all.  Worth seeing, but not worth owning.  And if you made it to the end, I would defiantly watch parts of it with the commentary on.  It was really worth it to hear the makers of the film talk about their work, especial the last few scenes.
B00006AFUR|5.0|I have to say, I just bought this disk, after seeing the band live, and I am totally hooked.  Heavy and melodic, poetic and proud.  What an amazing album.  I definately think anyone who likes tool, deftones, incubus, or any other band in that genre should get this record.  Each listen gets better as more and more of the craftsmanship shows through.  Truely a great piece of art!
B000031WD9|4.0|A classic teen movie from the '90s.  It's funny, poignant, and most of all entertaining.  I like the extra stuff in the unedited version, and the DVD has some good features and deleted scenes you may want to check out.
0441003257|5.0|Good omens is a book where everything in it isa satire.  It makes fun of Arrmageden, heaven hell and even witchhunts and prophency. this book is an example of Terry Pratchet's satirical writing style.
B000002KGT|5.0|This was the peak for FM. Coming just after the self-titled Fleetwood Mac album (also a great album)this pretty much placed FM at the top of the pop heap. I remember there were so many hits from it and it just a best-seller forever. It still sounds fresh. Unfortunately, the CD made from it sounds pretty bad - squashed and muffled, not at all like the vinyl. It is good to see there is a DVD version but for those of us who still listen to CDs, there really should be a remastered version. It is a crime that there isn't a better choice.
B000002KY8|5.0|Prince, fresh off of the critical disapointment of '81's \\"Constrovesy\\", returned in 1982 with a double LP that not only remains one of his best albums but blew the lid off of everyone (right before his massive hit \\"Purple Rain\\") while breaking him out of the R&B ghetto while he still retained his funk roots(in fact, he went deeper into them on this album).<br />\\"1999\\" opens with the instantly familiar title track with it's strident sythnizers and mawkish guitar scrathes. There have to be about only two people in the world who haven't heard this song! The classic chrous, \\"2000 zero zero over oops out of time/ So I'm gonna party like it's 1999\\" never ages! Originally sung by Prince, Lisa Coleman, and Revolutionist Dez Dickerson( the now-classic version is broken by their vocals), maybe mistake the song for funky Cold War commentary. WRONG!! If you REALLY listen to the lyrics, you'll see that the song is a slick little ode to having sex during the face of nuclear war (\\"I got a lion in my pocket/ And baby I'm ready to roar!\\"). Never before has sex talk sounded so funky! :-) Many also believe that if played backwards, this song has an Satanic message.<br />\\"1999\\", like Prince's prior work at the time has a strong sexual awareness, strong sexual ambiugity, and vauge religious overtones.
B000055Y0X|5.0|This is a great comedy, despite being simple and short.  Its genius is the fact that it starts out serious.  The first real joke of the film doesn't come for about 15 minutes in.  But then the jokes just keep coming and by the end it becomes so absurd, you know you are watching a great black comedy.<br />I last saw this 4 years ago and when I saw it again tonite I was surprised by what I'd forgotten.  I remembered Dr. Strangelove being a major character, but he's only in like 2 scenes.  And yet he steals them both, that's how astonishing a performer Peter Sellers is.<br />Although at times it may feel Mel Brooks-ish, the director is the legendary Stanley Kubrick and he shows it with reoccuring sexual undertones and brilliant satire.<br />A great film that will purify your bodily fluids.
B000001FI7|5.0|Portishead's 1994 debut, &quot;Dummy&quot;, is a timeless album that swings from mood to mood(from heartbreakingly dark to teary eyed to slightly optimistic). And implies many styles( rock, jazz, soul, hip hop, gospel, classical) while keeping it consistent and gaspingly beautiful. &quot;Dummy&quot; doesn't even sound like it was recorded in ANY era. It's ahead of it's time while keeping a effective film-noir quality. <br />The surprise hit &quot;Sour Times&quot; (&quot;No body loves me/ It's true&quot;) stills sounds relevant as it did when first released with it's tense delicacy. From the most accessible cut &quot;It Could Be Sweet&quot; to the quaint &quot;Numb&quot;(sampled by R&amp;B singer Ginuwine on his 1996 single &quot;G Thang&quot;) to the lithing morose state of &quot;Roads&quot; to the seductive &quot;It's A Fire&quot;, every song on &quot;Dummy&quot; is just enwraps you. Every song is beautiful and enticing. No filler or duds. <br />With Beth Gibbons' soft, delicate vocals (reminisit of Dido meets Sade) and Geoff Barrow's genius (he first got some shine producing Neneh Cherry's underrated classic &quot;Somedays&quot; on N's &quot;Homebrew&quot; project two years prior to this album's release),<BR>&quot;Dummy&quot; proves that it's one of the most influential albums of all-time. &quot;Glory Box&quot; has been heard in several films with it's Issac Hayes sample and slow strings and dozens of Portishead imitators and acts influenced by the group emerged. This album has been duplicated so many times. One of the best albums of the 1990s and one of the best debuts of all-time as well. Timeless (it could have been recorded this year, it's so relevant) and without peer (OK, maybe Esthero and Everything But The Girl!-since both are as high standing as these guys).<BR>You'll be in a new multilayered, multicolored world when you put this disc in. Out of this universe.
B0000648WZ|1.0|If the screenplay was actually an adaptation of Heinlein's book (which won the Hugo award) then this movie might have been quite a bit better.<br />The movie ended up being nothing more than a mixture of some deleted soap opera scenes interlaced with a script. Try reading the book and you will see how the story improves when all of these scenes are removed.
B00003CXAE|1.0|Paramount made us wait for this gem of a movie, boy did they make us wait.  Let me first start out by saying how much I love this all time classic, absolutely no dispute about that.  But I'm afraid the DVD is an almost unbelievably poor transfer - from virtually the first second you will notice huge levels of grain on the picture.  For me it's just too distracting and made me eject the disc within the first five minutes.  The 5.1 soundtrack, what I heard of it, was OK - but again it didn't have the punch I was expecting.  I guess for movie like this I was expecting Paramount to pull out all the stops, this HAS NOT happened.  I'll stick with my old LaserDisc, very, very disappointing.
B000002WMH|5.0|I got this while doing a major study on the life of Elvis Presley last year. I never read so many books on one person before. I found him to be a very fascinating subject.I even went out and bought a video player just to see his movies and documentaries on his life (we have no tv), and then I wanted a collection of his 50's music, because to me, that was the real Elvis. This is what you gotta have, if you want it all from the very beginning, all of what he did in the 50's. I listened to it from strictly an ''educational'' viewpoint, and am amazed and impressed with the vocal talent he had. To be honest, I feel the subject matter of many of the songs to be a bit silly, but then  I find most modern music to be lacking in values and good taste. The songs I do appreciate on here are the spirituals. And I like his songs from the film Love Me Tender, esp. ''We're Gonna Move''. I think Elvis could have done great as a folksinger too.  The songs from the films &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot; and &quot;King Creole&quot; are good too.If you like Elvis and are unsure of what exactly to get from the 100's of CD choices that are out there, just simplify the whole matter and get this set. You won't be disappointed. This IS Elvis.

B00006F7S4|5.0|It's true this is unlike any of Beck's previous CDs, but that's not a bad thing.  Beck has once again shown that he has the versatility and talent to cross over different musical boundaries.  Sea Change will catch you by surprise.  At first you think, &quot;this is not what I was hoping for&quot;, but you will end up realizing this is much more than you could have ever imagined. This CD demonstrates straight ahead songwriting coupled with pure and simple musical instrumentation: very calming and relaxing.  Highly recommended.  The more I listen the more I realize how great this CD really is.
B000002H97|5.0|This is a master piece of the metallica's music, you can feel the power of the album when you play \\"Enter Sadman\\" and listen the heavy songs like \\"Sad But True\\", \\"Don't Tread on Me\\", \\"Through the Never\\" and \\"Of Wolf and Man\\"; or you can listen the slow and melodic songs with a fantastic guitars like \\"Nothing else Matters\\" and \\"The Unforgiven\\". You can enjoy all the songs and feel the music and the instruments (The bass of \\"My friend Of Misery\\" awesome)... all the metallica's fans needs this album.
6305546789|5.0|John Carpenter is among one of the best screenwriters for horror to date. He has written and directed hits such as \\"Escape From New York\\", \\"The Thing\\", and \\"The Fog.\\" But none of these even compare to his masterpiece \\"Halloween.\\" This was one of the first slasher movies ever written and still remains as the best to date. This film uses suspence instead of gore and that really makes a diffrent. So many modern horror films use blood and gore to create tension and build up scares, but end out coming off just bloody. \\"Halloween,\\" has very little gore and maintains the highest intensity that a horror film could provide. Carpenter's camera work and atmosphere are so great here. Very few horror films have that aspect today. \\"Scream,\\" which was very good, is one of the best modern day horror films, but doesn't even compare to this. This is on a whole other level. A must for any film fan, and even if you're not, you should definitly check this one out.
0380973650|5.0|As with everything of Gaiman's that i've read, this book was just plain good damn't.  The unfamiliarity of the different gods in the story was a bit daunting, but I knew enough to get by.  It captured me right from the first chapter and made me want to finish it as quickly as time could allow. Try it, you'll like it.
B00004Z459|5.0|Linkin Park is, in essence, the boyband of modern rock.  Their lyrics are clean, without any swearing or offensive phrases, their music is clean (this is definately not metal, people), and their sound truly is hybrid of pop, rock and industrial electronica.  Their most popular song is clearly 'In The End,' an epic and almost romantic single that has launched their careers.  But listeners will be pleased to find that 'Hybrid Theory' is more than a vehicle for their hit single, and is in itself an excellent and high-quality CD well worth the money, with top-notch writing and mixing.  Though it can be argued that many of Linkin Park's songs sound the same, it's a good sound, so maybe that's not such a bad thing.<BR>Note: If you can, purchase the import, as it has the song 'My December,' quite possibly Linkin Park's most beautiful track ('My December' was omitted from the US edition).
B000067J24|1.0|Other reviewers have outlined the plot, such as it is. A majority of this movie consists of close up shots of Penelope Cruz which can be duplicated by simply staring at her photograph. The plot is time worn. Although Ms. Cruz's character is supposed to be one of a confident woman who is intelligent enough to do quite well on her own, her choices in men indicate no such intelligence and would suggest all that women want in life is to be in the arms of a man. I was still waiting for the movie to develop into something when the credits began to roll. Don't waste your money. If you really want to see it, rent before you buy.
B000069CWE|5.0|I liked 'Hybrid Theory' a lot.  When I heard that 'Reanimation' was merely 'HT' remixed, I was extremely sad, as I had been looking forward to a follow-up album.<BR>Then I heard 'Reanimation.'<BR>And realized it's a new breed of Linkin Park.<BR>Completely sliced, diced and blended through high-tech mixing equipment and resung  by many of rock and hip-hops top dogs, 'Reanimation' is a darker, meaner, more idustrial look at the pop-ish 'HT.'  While some of the songs stick fairly close to their roots ('Points of Authority' and 'With You' spring to mind), others take entirely new paths, and 'In The End,' you've got an almost entirely new spin on Linkin Park's music that is well worth the price of admission.  'My December', 'One Step Closer', 'Crawling' and 'Runaway' stand out as the cream of the crop, while 'In The End' almost seems ruined in its new hip-hop style.  However, fans of Linkin Park will appreciate the refreshed style, even if it is the same music.  So if you're looking for a 'Cure For the Itch,' 'Reanimation' is just what the doctor ordered.<BR>NOTE: 'My December' alone is possibly the best remix in the history of music.  Never before have I heard a track remixed somehow maintain ALL of the best elements of the original, and yet gain something even more with the remix.  Be sure to check it out.
6305265666|5.0|Very often \\"realistic fantasy stories\\" flop like dying fish. \\"Ever After\\" is one of the few exceptions, a sparkling tale about Cinderella in a semi-historic setting, with an outstanding cast, strong script, and a delightful love story. What's a fairy tale without magic? It's \\"Ever After.\\"<br />Danielle (Drew Barrymore) is a young girl raised alone by her father, who encourages his daughter's intelligence, curiosity and strong will. But her life takes a tragic turn when her father marries a haughty social-climber Baroness Rodmilla De Ghent (Angelica Houston), and brings her and her two daughters Marguerite and Jacqueline (Megan Dodds and Melanie Lynskey) to live with Danielle. He dies tragically of a heart attack, leaving his daughter alone with his widow. Years later, Danielle is treated like one of the servants, with whom she is a loyal friend. Her only relics of her past life are a pair of shoes and a beautiful dress left by her mother.<br />When one of the servants is imprisoned falsely for theft, Danielle goes to try to save him. And there, she bumps into the young Prince Henry, who is being pressured by his stuffy parents to marry -- and Rodmilla is targeting him as a potential mate for one of her daughters. But Henry falls in love with Danielle -- her intelligence, her political knowledge, her love of fun, her bravery, and her strength.As Danielle and the prince grow closer, the scheming of her stepmother threatens to destroy their relationship.<br />The director knows the right way to mix comedy and drama in a way that seems entirely plausible. When Henry \\"dumps\\" the Spanish princess, or when he wakes his parents with all sorts of bright plans, the audience laughs out of affectionate amusement. You like or dislike the characters exactly as the director wants you to. And he apparently knows that magic is less in plot elements than in the atmosphere -- though the setting is medieval France, there is the sort of bright, ornate look to the castle and clothes that you see in fairy tales. (The only exception is the painfully-90s gown and sparkling makeup that Danielle wears at the climax. This is medieval France, not the Butterfly prom!) The script is full of funny or tense moments, and the frequent uses of Sir Thomas More's \\"Utopia\\" add an extra dimension of realism. And, in perhaps the most brilliant move in this film, one of the stepsisters is not \\"wicked.\\" Rather the chubby, not-as-pretty but good-natured Jacqueline adds a silent ally to Danielle and prevents Jacqueline and Marguerite from turning, essentially, into one character.<br />Drew Barrymore is exquisite as Danielle, putting on Danielle's intelligence, wit and strength with ease and believability. Thankfully Danielle is never turned into a feminist in the usual sense of the word; she is unafraid to show that she is every inch a man's equal, but the movie doesn't bash viewers with that theme. Dougray Scott is equally good as Henry, mixing pride and confusion, sweetness and boredom into a very believable young prince. Anjelica Huston is almost hammily enjoyable as Rodmilla; Dodds and Lynskey are even better as her daughters. And even Leonardo da Vinci (Patrick Godfrey) makes an appearance to help smooth out the course of true love.<br />This is a family movie in the best sense of the word. The plotline and scripting are clever enough for adults to enjoy thoroughly, but there is nothing that the kids can't watch. So get everyone together and watch this enchanting retelling.t you see in fairy tales. (The only exception is the painfully-90s gown and sparkling makeup that Danielle wears at the climax.

B000068TPN|5.0|I know alot of people who fought in the Vietnam War, on the ground and in the air.  This movie was the best I have ever seen, from the eyes of those who were on the ground or in the air (helicopter).  I think it did not get the rave reviews because it shows the truth, straight forward.  And lots of time the truth isn't politically correct and people don't want to admit it.  I was speachless at the end.  I had to sit for a while before getting up.  This movie should be seen by all who bad mouth what took place in Vietnam and didn't welcome back those who came home.  They just don't get it.  They don't know.  This movie shows you.
B00006F7IM|1.0|I LOVE this film... since it's initial release, it has been one of my &quot;guilty pleasure&quot; VHS tapes. Now that the DVD has finally arrived after several years of waiting, I feel as though I've been taken. In the first place, this film is OBVIOUSLY CROPPED from the 4x3 format to make it look as though it's widescreen. This is NOT the theatrical &quot;widescreen&quot; release. Check out the opening scenes where the Indian's futility is told via a series of newspaper headlines of the times. Most of the headlines have the upper halves of the letters CHOPPED OFF! This is SHAMEFUL! The DVD's producers have actually given us LESS than the VHS tape. Second, there are NO, NONE, ZERO extras on this DVD. What exactly were we waiting all this time for?<br />Anybody out there who waited as I did for all this time for this DVD is in for a big letdown.
0684833395|5.0|Can a writer create a classic work based on insanity?  Can the way in which war is conducted be considered insane?  Can insanity be fun?  If you dare say yes to these questions, then you'll enjoy this classic novel, seemingly written from the inside out.<br />Writers often find the notion of flashback difficult, and if anything, Joseph L. Heller has endeared himself to us all by teaching us how to turn that dilemma into part and parcel in this masterpiece that is the Catch 22.

0316666343|4.0|Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold was a terrific book! I can honestly say that it was very different, which made it so good. Besides the first chapter, where Sebold provides a descriptive view of Suzie Salmon's rape and death, the book is mostly a serious book of love, tragedy, escape, hope and future. I was on my toes near the middle of the book. The suspense factor kicked in when Lindsey Salmon breaks in to her sister's suspected killer's house to steal evidence, only to find him returning home early. I recommend this book to anyone who is sick of the same old novels, and need a nice change of pace.

B00003CXAE|5.0|Well, like many of you I have waited a long time for &quot;Grease&quot; to be released on DVD and letterboxed to boot!  Although I only viewed this disc once...upon watching it I had the full 5.1 surround going on, I noticed that in some sections of the film the sound would drop off and in some places it sounded muffled.  How sad.  Now, this can probably be explained away in many ways, but I know that my surround system is fine and my DVD player is working great so you can elminate those options.  I have DVDs of foreign B-horror movies that sound better than this.  Could it be the disc? Maybe?  But I've never bought one yet with this problem and I have 280.  Could it be Paramount yet again doing a lack luster job in their production.  They've put so many of their movies out on DVD that aren't 5.1, maybe they really don't know how to encode their films into 5.1 or don't care if they do it properly.  There could be many reasons why this happened, but it is a sight for sore eyes to see Grease with a least a decent anamorphic transfer and on a disc that I won't wear out from too many viewings.  Now, let's hope this doesn't happen to Flashdance.
0316666343|4.0|Overall I found this book to be a very good read.  It was well written, entertaining, engaging, and occasionally thought provoking.  While at the very beginning it seems as though it is going to be a bit of a murder mystery, having you wonder if the girl's killer will be caught or not, by the time you get to the end of the book you realize that what you got instead is an in depth picture of a family working to heal the worst of wounds.  Where this book succeeds the most is in presenting the characters as real people providing a model of how it might be possible to come to terms with an occurrence which is surely every family's worst nightmare.<br />The only area in which this book didn't quite work for me was in the picture of heaven itself, and the elements where events go from realistic to fantastic.  Everyone's picture of the after-life is surely different, so the mileage of others may vary.  However, I would have preferred this story avoided blurring the line between life and death.  I didn't mind that the narrator was speaking from heaven, but the instances where she becomes apparent in the living world struck me as forced and contrived. It doesn't really add much to the story, and I found that it draws into question the ability of a family to heal such devastation without a little ghostly help.  <br />All told though, a good story.  Worth the time.  Uplifting and enheartening.  Good for a distraction and a boost.
B00006F7S4|1.0|This is Beck's lowest point as a lyric writer and musician.<BR>It's clear that the music and tone is about a failed relationship. Beck should have been able to mine this period of his life for some depth like many musicians before him but he can only cough up cliches like \\"you're dead to me now\\".  <br />Beck as a confessional singer/songwriter doesn't cut it. Compare this music to someone like Suzanne Vega's \\"Songs in Red and Gray\\" from last year which created great poetry out of her failed marriage. Compare this music to early Neil Young, whose song's like \\"Heart of Gold\\" or \\"Don't let it Bring you Down\\" cover the same region of the heart.<br />Perhaps in time he may be able to pull some depth out of his private pain, but in this cd he tries for the spirt of Dylan and ends up sounding like Gordon Lightfoot.

071198042X|2.0|This book could easily have been condensed to 1/4 of the pages.  Each event or memory written about goes on and on, and on... - impatient readers beware.<br />While the author does a great job of providing every little detail, it is amazing to believe that he could remember everything in this much living colour, and doubtful that at the time he carried around a notebook to record everything happening around him.<br />Generally the writing is poor to midland at best and it is obvious the author is not a professional writer.  The book also could have been organised a bit better, for it is not chronological, nor are chapter headings or topics given.<br />The reader will sense that the author wrote this book out of memory for his friend, Freddie Mercury, rather than out of primary interest in the royalties.  Overall, this book is for only the most fanatical of Queen fans and for those supremely interested in Freddie Mercury.
B00006F83Y|4.0|I haven't dug into the Kyuss vaults yet, but I did enjoy QOTSA's Rated R CD, on the strength of their single 'The Lost Art of Keeping A Secret' and various Sabbathy grooves like 'Better Living Through Chemistry'.  I suspected that QOTSA's new CD would be a worthwhile purchase, and it is.  The scary parts are scarier, the loud parts are louder, and Dave Grohl on drums definitely adds a much more intricate sonic layer over Rated R.  I personally prefer the louder tunes on this CD, such as opener 'Millionaire', the staccato 'The Sky Is Fallin', the minute-and-a-half purging of cusses entitled 'Six Shooter' and the absolutely revelatory 'A Song For The Deaf'.  Also quite awesome are the bouncy yet sinister 'No One Knows', the flat-out \\"rawk\\" of 'God Is On The Radio' (this is for you, Black Sabbath fans), and the lyrically goofy but musically delightful 'Mosquito Song', courtesy of Dean Ween.  Also noteworthy is the little 8-bit Nintendo-style electronica found by rewinding the CD at the beginning of track 1.  It's remarkably [un-important], but it's neat to know that its there.  Still, there are a couple songs that should have been left off the CD.  These would be 'Go With The Flow' and 'Another Love Song', both of which sound like the tailored, watered-down radio-fodder they satirically condemn on various interludes on the CD.  These threaten to break the momentum, but for every forgettable tune, there are 5 or 6 can't-miss tracks that display incredible energy and relentless creativity.  Thumbs up.

B00005JKDR|5.0|The movie is great...whoever came up with the story line has quite the imagination.  My nephew (11 years old) loves this movie and so does my neice (7 years old).  The DVD has 2 discs.  One has the movie in wide screen or full screen.  It also has the out takes like the other Pixar movies have had.  The 2nd disc has the &quot;extra's&quot; including short animations &quot;Mike's New Car&quot; and 2 others (can't remember the names).  It also has games that can be played right on the dvd player with the remote.  It has a CD/ROM section that I have not investigated.  There are two sections labeled &quot;for humans only&quot; and &quot;for monsters only&quot; on the 2nd disc also which has the play that Mike monster talks about in the actual movie.  There is also a music video and sneek peeks at new movies coming out for Disney in theatres and for sale.  This is a great addition to your collection and is well worth the price for all the extra's that are on the 2 disc set.

B00003CXAE|4.0|Today, I went out to the local video store and purchased GREASE on DVD at a very low price and yours truly is now delighted to own this long awaited film on DVD.<br />I was delighted and disappointed by the films release on DVD.   First off, this film is just a rehash of the 1998 VHS release which was the disappointment.  ....<br />Despite the disappointments, there are many delightful things to say about the DVD release.    I love the packaging.   This film is available in Widescreen (2.35:1) and Full Screen (1.33:1) editions...   This film is packaged like a book (like the Panic Room) with the disc inside with a GREASE Songbook, which I though was a real hoot.  I have always wanted the lyrics to all ot most of the songs from the film....<br />With this film being finally available on DVD, the menu board and scene selction and audio options are quite basic.   The film on Widescreen or Fullscreen are presented in top notch sound and picture quality with not much dirt or dust to be found.   The sound could have been better cause it was a bit loud and scratchy at times when it didn't need to be.   There are cast and cast interviews originally contained in the 1998 VHS release and of course, the theatrical trailer which was exciting to watch.<br />In conclusion, GREASE is greatly welcomed on DVD with its great packaging and available feautures but this DVD deserved much more extra feautures than what was put in here.   Otherwise, run out and get your copy of GREASE today.<br />GREASE is forever the word !!!
B000068IEU|4.0|I must admit that I purchased this DVD based on the film's infamous reputation and place in the history of horror.  Having seen it, I am glad to have it in my collection but still have mixed feelings about it--and understand that most of the public would probably hate it.  A low-budget film filled with inappropriate music, inappropriate comic interludes, and performances ranging from decent to disgusting: this packs none of the terrifying punch its contemporaries (Texas Chainsaw Massacre) and doesn't quite get as sick as some of its immediate descendants (I Spit On Your Grave).  Still, it definitely pushed many boundaries--for its day.<br />The DVD itself is wonderful, the film restored to its full uncut version, a funny commentary track, deleted scenes, several trailers, and an excellent making-of documentary which finds most of the original cast being interviewed.
B00006IX0R|4.0|The Cranberries started out the early nineties as one of pop's most promising musical units, thanks in large part to their knack for melodic dream pop and Dolores O'Riordan's Sinead-like wail.  Somewhere along the way, however, they seemed to stray from their initial path, with their music becoming increasingly riddled with overt political commentary(which, when lyricized by O'Riordan, was almost always laughable)and musically even sounding occasionally like just another corporate rock band, the only difference being the screaming banshee lead singer.  But, when they were good, they were very good--'Linger' remains their shining moment, but they still managed several small jewels among the otherwise overbaked rubbish that often littered their studio sets.  Both 'Dreams' and the hard-rocking 'Zombie' rate among their best--and they must have thought so too, considering as how they remade both later under the titles 'Analyse' and 'Hollywood', respectively. That aside, there's little to complain about here--this is a strong retrospective that actually does everyone the favor of wading through their spotty studio sets and placing all their essential music front and center on one disc.  Highly recommended.
B00005JKJA|5.0|Mulholland Drive was one of the most polarizing films of 2001, not surprising considering that it came from one of the most polarizing directors ever--David Lynch.  Lynch has made a career of strange films, with quirky characters, non-linear plots, violent and/or psychosexual imagery, and themes which invite ever interpretation under the sun--that is, unless the viewer simply dismisses it as \\"too weird.\\"  With such a history behind him, Lynch's latest film seems nothing if not a natural progression from its predecessors.  <br />The plot can be summarized in only a few sentences, but the paths the characters (and their seeming alter-egos) take could fill up a book.  Many viewers have said that multiple viewings have still not cleared away the cobwebs of their confusion.  However, I was quite surprised to find that even after seeing it once, I felt like I \\"got\\" most of it.  I feel simultaneously lucky--and fearful that my interpretation was incorrect.  Consequently, I will be returning for several more viewings.<br />Kudos must go to Lynch's masterful direction, the beautiful cinematography (curiously, shot in 1.85 rather than 2.35 like, say, Blue Velvet), the music, and the great acting.  And even if the story confuses the heck out of you, you can still enjoy the two hot girls.
B00006AFUR|5.0|THis cd is definately one to buy.  This band really captures your attention.  They have such AWESOME guitar riffs that just make you sit back and have your tongue hang out of your mouth.  it is simply awesome.
B00006G8K0|5.0|I've changed my opinion of this product, after a second viewing.<br />I thank Warner Bros. for releasing Horror of Dracula on DVD.   It's about time.  Those of us hungry for Hammer Horror films have been waiting for this for a long time.  And we wait with baited breath for the other titles liscensed to Warners.  <br />This is generally thought of as the closest film version of Bram Stoker's original novel.  Though it does not follow the novel by the letter, it keeps the spirit of the novel, and adds some heroic flavor that was much needed since the Univeral version released some thirty-five years before.  Warner has released it in anamorphic widescreen, and in stereo. I don't think \\"Horror\\" has ever looked this good on any previous release.  I do think it's a shame that Warner did the bare minimum of extras.  They still don't seem to appreciate the money making potential of Hammer Horror film fans world-wide.  I don't know why the early-on announced collaboration with Christopher Lee didn't pan out, perhaps he was too busy.  These days he's been in the public eye more than I can recall in decades.<br />The extras are as close to non-existant as possible without being invisible. What is offered is barely more than rehashed, already known trivia to the Hammer Horror fan, and more than likely to the general public who's ever happened across an article about Hammer Studios.  And apparently, whomever was put in charge of the dvd cover art, didn't do the research before putting together the art for the back cover (they made the same mistake for the newly released \\"Curse of Frankenstein\\", which sports a scene from \\"The Mummy\\" on the back cover), which includes a scene from another Hammer Horror film that is most definately not \\"Horror of Dracula\\".   I suppose that's nit-picking.  <br />The truly unfortunate thing is, I like Warner Bros. They've given us tons of wonderful films over the decades; anything from dark mystery films with Bogart to way out sci-fi adventures suchas Outland or THEM. But many of us who study film, and have grown up loving certain themes and stories presented in films, such as the good against evil portrayed in films like \\"Horror of Dracula\\", are willing and waiting to hand over money for a wonderful product meant for us. It's just taking so long for them to understand this.<br />There was a wonderful opportunity here for a satisfying exhange between provider (Warners) and consumer (the fans, us), that somehow got a little muddled.<br />Still, to have this movie in it's original widescreen format, from a source print that is definately better than any previous release, makes it a must buy.  I don't think you'll be disappointed.  And once again, with a huge company like Warner Bros., money talks.  If sales for this release do well, we may see some of the other Hammer titles they hold, like \\"Taste the Blood of Dracula\\", or \\"Dracula Has Risen From the Grave\\".
B00003CXI1|3.0|You can read the rest of the reviews here regarding the film itself, which I found to be quite a bit of fun.  However, the DVD extras leave something to be desired, since there is no way to quickly view the behind-the-scenes portions of the DVD.  Instead, you are forced to play the games included on the DVD in order to view the deleted or extra material.  It ends up to be incredibly clumsy and cumbersome.  Why the makers of this DVD did not separate the games from the extras is beyond me.  In frustration I never got to see the additional materials, which I feel are one of the main reasons for purchasing a DVD copy over a VHS one.<br />However, the DVD version will always have better picture and sound, and from that alone I reccomend the DVD.
B00005JLEU|5.0|The movie combines elements of SO many different cultures, from traditional japanese, to greek myth. The attention to detail is such that you find yourself sucked in, as a silent watcher, and wishing somehow that you could be there. It is a movie for everyone...every age, every gender, doesn't matter.  Just see it, and judge for yourself.<br />The story (briefly) follows a young girl, who has to adapt to a complete change in life when she wanders into a world of spirits and witches and magic, and finds herself without her parents and only one, very confusing, friend.
B000008GEF|5.0|by Suckerfly.<br />I've decided to rewrite my original review of `Living In The Material World', feeling that I didn't do the album or the writer justice.<br />I discovered the Beatles finding the `Let It Be' album my uncle had left behind at our house. Looking at the cover, I knew who Paul and Ringo were, but not the other two. This was when I was 7 years old.<br />In 1976, I bought my first album. George Harrison's 33 1/3 was my purchase. The reasons Harrison became the person in The Beatles who appealed to me most, or became my `favourite' I cannot really understand myself. And even though `Dear One' was a song written in devotion to Krishna, at 9 years old I had no concept of what he was writing about, I just knew it was one of my favourite songs to listen to. Harrison's spiritual leanings actually got me to check out religion and what it was saying to the masses, and by the time I was 11 I knew everything I needed to know about organised Western religion that needs knowing. My understanding of Hindu, Buddhist, Muslim and Hebrew religions came later.<br />In saying this, a few of Harrison's albums did not immediately grab my attention being of `unconscious mind'. These were Extra Texture, Somewhere In England and Living In The Material World. The immediacy of `All Things Must Pass', '33 1/3', `George Harrison' and `Dark Horse' had a fan in me, but these other albums I didn't quite grasp what was going on. Now that I am older, and maybe a bit wiser, `Living In The Material World' hits me far deeper and emotionally than that of my younger self. I now realise, it is probably Harrison's truest testament of faith in a harsh world. In large, it is a stronger album lyrically and spiritually than `All Things Must Pass', and in it you truly see a glimpse of the man himself. His thoughts, his failings, and his hopes. You could probably ask me why I don't see the same things in Lennon's `Plastic Ono Band'. The answer wouldn't be easy, but I know somewhere in there I'd have to say some of Lennon's `thoughts' rang false or hypocritical to me then, and now.<br />`Material World' is a themed piece. What used to be side one explores the material, the immediate, the physical sensations and ego. The second side is the spiritual and devotional. The beauty of the second side is that the devotional songs are mostly ambiguous in lyric, so that they translate into being songs about love to anyone, not just Krishna, or God. This is true throughout most of Harrison's spiritual songs like the aforementioned `Dear One' or `That Is All'. These are just as easily songs to a lover as they are to a God, and `That Is All' I would love to hear covered by someone, ANYONE, even Mariah Carey, because its melody and sentiment is beautiful to say the least. Side 2 is a masterpiece on its own with `Be Here Now', `The Day the World Gets Round', `That Is All' and `Try Some Buy Some'. They didn't enchant me as much when I was a kid, but now I see they are 4 of the best songs he ever wrote.<br />The album opens with the single `Give Me Love (Give Me Peace On Earth)', which reached number 1 in May 1973 (5 months later he would hit number 1 again with `Photograph', written with Ringo Starr).<br />It's main lyric,`Give me love, give me peace on earth, give me light, give me life, keep me free from birth, give me hope, help me cope, with this heavy load, trying to touch and reach you with heart and soul' is a heartfelt request, that I think everyone at one time has asked in their life, whether they believe in God or not. `Free from birth' just means, keep me from repeating this cycle over and over again, that I gain enlightenment in this lifetime and not have to return. It's a gentle song, with some great instrumentation. `Sue Me Sue You Blues' concentrates on The Beatles legal hassles, and shows off Harrison's slide guitar playing and acerbic wit. `The Light That Has Lighted the World' comments on people's perceptions of YOU, or in this case Harrison, but it can applyto every person in the world. It is a song of hope, while others around you see fit to deprive you of such. The obvious single potential of `Don't Let Me Wait Too Long' has not escaped many ears, but I feel Harrison was trying to lie low in 1973. He had a busy and tumultuous time since 1970, so the release of a second single from `Material World' was probably not foremost in his mind.<br />There are people who agree with themselves that Lennon & McCartney were of better voice than Harrison, that they displayed a certain confidence in their singing that Harrison did not have. Now obviously, confidence can come when you have many sycophants telling you you're great, but I've noticed that the confident singer also relies on tricks of the trade, and theatrics to bring across their message. Harrison is an emotive singer, what he sings he means, and I think this carries a far more emotional weight than those who sing with a confidence that can carry a multitude of genres. No more so than on Harrison's `Who Can See It'. This is a beautifully sung piece of work, and his falsetto is soulful and heartbreaking. The lyric, `I only ask that what I feel should not be denied me now. As it's been earned, and I have seen my life belongs to me. My love belongs to who can see it.' Is so poignant, I don't think anyone could sing it better. It is totally Harrison's. The title track closes the physical world set. A wonderful album in whole. 5 stars +.y to every person in the world. It is a song of hope, while others around you see fit to deprive you of such.

B00005OAIE|1.0|I don't normally write negative reviews, but come on people! This clown was influenced by Stevie Ray Vaughan? Funny, I don't recall Stevie Ray Vaughan aiming his music straight at yuppies and preppies, or singing songs with laughably overwrought titles like \\"Your Body is a Wonderland.\\" I mean, I'm not just another mainstream hater, but this guy is so bland and inoffensive he makes the Dave Matthews Band look like Slayer!  Life for most of us is mundane enough, I don't really think we need music like this to make it even more so. Get a Queens of the Stone Age album for Pete's sake.
B000002UEB|2.0|First of all, I think the phrase \\"heavy metal\\" is being thrown around too loosely on some of these other reviews.  Queensyrche is not heavy metal--it's barely even metal in the first place, let alone heavy!  Also, this album is not a cross between metal and Pink Floyd, this album is a cross between Pink Floyd and Foreigner.<br />There is great focus in this album.  The transitions between songs are smooth, and there is a definite story that flows through the music.  But, the music itself is just not exciting enough to back up the lyrics.  If a band is going to sing about \\"burning the White House down,\\" then they had better back that up with a more aggressive sound.  Another thing about the lyrics:  if you are a conservative individual who actually trusts the government (like me, I suppose), then the lyrics will not thrill you.  <br />Again, I'm going to say the music just wasn't good enough to make the crappy liberal lyrics a moot point; Megadeth's \\"Rust in Peace\\" is an example of how incredible music conquers all--no matter what your individual political opinion.  I recommend that album if you don't already have it.  In fact, I think I'm going to listen to that album now.  Maybe it will cheer me up; I'm so depressed after buying a CD that belongs in Al Gore's music collection--it's almost as boring as him.
B000002J1U|5.0|After Zeppelin released the II album, a basically rock-blues-heavy-driven record, it would be hard to guess what the intrepid Page would set up next. And they delivered this magnific album. Combining the mellowness of Tangerine and That´s the Way with the agressiveness of Out on the Tiles and Immigrant Song, including the raw folk-stylish Bron-Yr-Aur Stomp and Hat´s off to (Roy) Harper, this album is a must-have to all rock/blues fans.<br />The acoustic tones undoubtedly are more present, and this record may be considered a full class about alternate tunings for guitar, exploring lots of alternatives for guitar players around the world. Some surprises are included throughout the album, such as Since I´ve been loving you, that breaks with the vibe present in the rest of the album. Hat´s off... finalizes the album with one of the craziests slide blues ever. Plant´s vocal is in full shape, but John Paul and Bonzo are sometimes kept in the background, but it doesn´t make this album any worse, as they had shown their full potential in the predecessor album.
B00005B36H|5.0|Even though the members of the band itself probably belong in a mental institution their music is very good and this has to be their best album yet. Songs such as the Patient, Ticks and Leeches, and Lateralus keep you glued to the CD player for a long time listening to the tracks over and over. Highly recommended.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|A brilliant work of storytelling which immerses the viewer into the life of a man with a severe memory problem, called anterograde memory loss. He cannot make any new memories since the accident which left his wife dead, and he can only remember 15 minutes at a time. <BR>The Nolan team creates a world which allows the viewer to sympathize with the difficulties of the man, not only living with a memory problem, but also with the unrealized revenge of his wife's murder. <BR>The disorientating method of the presentation of the movie sequences allows the viewer to experience first hand the challenges he faces. It also ingeniously places the viewer into the mind of the the main character, because the viewer only learns the plot at 15 fifteen minute intervals. Not only does the viewer feel disorientated in fifteen minute parcels, the movie moves from the end backwards to the beginning. I have never seen a movie that has been capable of showing the end and then worked its way backward to the beginning without giving away the plot until the very end. <BR>This is a truly ingenious movie with rich characters, superb acting, and directorial excellence. I recommend it to anyone with high expectations for a movie.
630439845X|5.0|This is the best film. And the music is so nice. If you play piano your self this is the one too see.

B000066NW0|5.0|I really think that Avril is going to a Sucessful Carrer a head of her. The album is so sweet and I like the way she writes about her feelings and whats happened in her life. I've seen her live and i think that she sounds better live then on the radio. In my opinon I think this album is great and you should go pick it up because she can sing and can play guitar.
B00003CXA4|5.0|.<BR>You probably already have a basic idea of who Gandhi was, and that this film won scads of awards.  You may even have seen the movie when it came out in the theatres.  Well, it is time you saw it again!  It's an appreciative script, wonderfully shot, and excellently portrayed.  It conveys the basic tenets of Gandhi's philosphy, and demonstrates the roots of the political schisms that exist today.  (Not just re India & Pakistan, but also the imapct of hardliners and what they can cause - - very relevant to Northern Ireland & Israel.)<br />The scope, given its three hours, is broad enough to start well before India, with Gandhi's early efforts against racist regulations in South Africa and the sacrifices implied by peaceful resistance.  The film brings in Gandhi's failures, successes, idealism, and compromises.  It also shows his human weaknesses.  (I don't agree with others that the portrait is completely saintly.)<br />The performances are wonderfully understated, not just from Ben Kingsley, but also form the entire cast.  And casting was wonderful, not just for the major parts but also the minor ones - - there is a scene late in the movie where a bereaving father visits Gandhi, and the actor who plays him (in even this small role) is just terrific.<br />One small complaint regarding the DVD.  They haven't indexed the scenes as well as they could have.  The scene index directly after the \\"intermission\\" is after a subsequent, important scene.  Thus, if you split your viewing across two nights (it's a three hour movie, so you might), it's not easy to pick up just after the intermission (you either skip the following scene, or have to watch all of the scene before the intermission).  It would have been just as easy for them to cut the index so that an index appears -immediately- after the intermission.
0894803123|4.0|It makes good ice cream with my Cuisinart maker. Follow the instructions and its easy. They aren't kidding when they say &quot;generous&quot; quart, either. Use at least a 1.5 quart machine!<br />One note - they do not recommend artificial sweeteners at all. I am a low-carb guy, and I substituted Splenda in every recipe I tried so far. The results were great. B and J don't recommend it, but I do. It works fine and tastes great.
B00006F83Y|4.0|I wrote this band off at first based on their repetitive drug joke single \\"feel good hit of the summer\\" from a few years ago, but after hearing the excellent \\"no one knows\\" and finding out none other than Dave Grohl was manning the drum kit, I found it [inexpensive] and decided to give it a chance. And while nothing else quite has the same ability to kick ... and stick in your head at the same time as that single, the rest of the album mostly consists of some expertly pulled off black sabbath inspired stoner metal with a nice mixture of pummelling riffs and melodicism. The only major flaw is a few bits of self indulgence that seems to occasionally undermine the record. Possibly inspired by The Who Sell Out, between most of the songs are bits of satirical radio DJ banter from various different \\"stations\\". While these do raise a chuckle from time to time (the hyperactive spanish announcer impression is hillariously spot on), they ultimately start to grate at about the second listen, if not halfway through the first. There's a few other gags on the album too, like making the first minute and a half of the album almost convince you that you accidentally bought an IDM album recorded entirely underwater, but these are less prevalent and therefor a bit less bothersome.
B00006FXB6|4.0|Having said that....this album sounds like a cross between Nirvana's &quot;Nevermind&quot; and The Masters Of Reality album &quot;Sunrise On The Sufferbus&quot;.   Personnally I would have loved a few more fuzzed up guitar licks and solos, but the Johnny Ramone in me  said &quot;Forget About It!&quot;.   But still.. rock is guitar so hence the four stars instead of five.
B00004W510|5.0|There are 3 albums that, when I hear them, instantly put me in the frame of mind for the season of fall.<br />Those albums are \\"Astral Weeks,\\" \\"Rubber Soul,\\" and \\"The Band.\\"<br />That doesn't mean that I only listen to those records during the fall.  But I first heard each of them in late October and something about their music conjures up an autumn frame of mind for me.<br />The first band album, \\"Music From Big Pink,\\" contained new songs written by Bob Dylan, during a time when Dylan -- recuperating from his \\"motorcycle accident\\" -- hadn't released anything for some time.  That selling point got The Band in the door, but \\"The Band\\" proved that had plenty of their own musical ammunition to unload.  Robbie Robertson wrote or co-wrote all twelve songs and there really isn't a bad one in the bunch.<br />And the musicianship is excellent here.  The mesh of Rick Danko's vocals and the horns on \\"Unfaithful Servent\\" are moving in ways that only the best pop music can be; and Richard Manuel's soft but strong tenor, coupled with Levon Helm's harmonies on \\"Whispering Pines,\\" is literally capable of twisting something inside my gut.  <br />The role of producer and engineer John Simon shouldn't be downplayed, either.  Though he wasn't an official member of the Band, he also played tuba, horn, keyboards and the peck horn and had a lot to do with the sound of the music.<br />This is an finely-tuned album created by road-seasoned professionals, but there's also a looseness and a feeling of a pick-up game.  That kind of duality flows through the whole thing: it has songs about the Civil War, unions, sailors, flat-footing, slaves, crops... and yet it was recorded primarily in the cabana by the pool at a Beverly Hills mansion once owned by Sammy Davis, Jr.<br />What it all adds up to is the perfect music for a drive through the country, an afternoon of leaf raking, or a really festive pre-Thanksgiving party.  <br />It's a true classic.
B00000I924|5.0|I didn't like this album at first becuase of all the electronic sampling that most of the songs had going on.  After listening to Engines of Creation by Joe Satriani which is another amazing electronic/guitar album, I gave Who Else! another spin.  Right then and there it suddenly dawned on me how awesome this album is.  Two songs really jump out me on this album, Brush with the Blues and What Mamma Said.  Highly reccomended from a guitar enthusist.
B000002JPA|5.0|Definitively, a master piece from one of the most successful bands in the progressive rock world. If you are entering the prog. rock world, this is an excelent head start.  Once you listen IAW you will have to buy all DT collection, Guaranteed.
6305313687|2.0|Let me first state that I gave the movie two stars because, despite the leftist political message, there is also a humanitarian message.  It is also an entertaining movie as well.<br />What I simply despise about this movie is the pure emotional fear mongering tactics employed in order to underscore the legitimate arguments made by racists in the movie.  To avoid going off into an extended rant about this, something that will not be productive at all, I will cite but one example (no, I do not feel it is a spoiler).<br />The dinner scene was quite telling, for me, as far as the intended political message of the film.  Here you have a house headed by an undeniable racist, hosting a dinner with his racist girlfriend, his sister, his brother, his mother, and his mother's Jewish friend whom she appears to be perusing an intimate relationship with.  Through the course of the dinner, the topic of the Rodney King trial and subsequent riots comes up.  Norton's character makes simple and straightforward legitimate arguments.  The teacher puts forth an argument that riots are simply an emotional expression of rage.  Logically Norton's character is going to put forth a contrary argument.  Listen to it.  No racist language contained whatsoever.  He states that riots are no more than \\"opportunism at its worse\\" and \\"it's a bunch of people grabbing any excuse they can find to loot a store, nothing more\\".  Is that point refuted?  Not overtly...  the fact that this character is a racist automatically means that there is no bearing to what he is saying.  Abraham Lincoln himself was a \\"racist\\" by the most pure definition of the word, does that in any way underscore his legitimate argument that the slaves were people, an therefore entitled to the same natural rights as free white men?  Of course not.  If we were stuck on such emotional pleas instead of looking at the merits of arguments, slavery would still exist in this nation.<br />Next Norton's character goes on to discredit their arguments by stating, \\"What you're doing is taking one thing and calling it something else, you know, alleviating the responsibility these people have for their own actions.\\"  Is that a racist argument?  I thought the individual responsibility and liberty was a main tenant of the theory of natural rights, the very theory upon which our nation was founded.  Is that a radical and racist argument as well?  Apparently, since the man making it has, as the Amazon.com review pointed out, swastikas tattooed on his body.  As he's making his rational arguments, the only reply anyone has to say is, \\"Look who's talking here, mister junior KKK.\\"  After that he goes on to beat his family.  So anyone who holds these completely rational views about the issue is a racist who enjoys beating his family?  That's what those who made this video would like you to believe in order to detract from those legitimate arguments.<br />Come on, people.  This is leftist fear mongering at its worse.  Sure, they make a good point about how racism is much like a cycle, but they did nowhere near enough to show the other side of the story.  What about how \\"leaders\\" in the black community are fighting to establish racial preferences in our law?  Hey, you know what, I have a dream too, and it's the same dream that Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. once had.  I too \\"have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: `We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal.'\\"  I too dream that when I have children, they \\"will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. I have a dream today.\\"  Truth is that dream is being undermined more today, not by white racists, but by progressive liberals and \\"leaders\\" in the black community, people who are actively trying to institute a system of racial preference in our laws.  How can the preaching of personal responsibility by Norton's character be racist, but the active attempts of a popular movement to institute racial preferences in our laws be any different?<br />The message given during the climax (I cannot go into detail for fear of spoiling the movie) is a great message, and I agree 100%.  I just wish that instead of them perpetuating this myth that the only threat to just racial equality in America is white racists, they'd have explored the -overt- racist nature of black \\"leaders\\" in this nation.  Leaders recognized by the media and lavished praise.  The difference between white racists and black racists is that white racists are stuck in trailer parks because they're white trash, black racists like Louis Farrakhan and Jesse Jackson are wealthy and well renown because they know how to exploit emotional sentiment well.<br />American History X is a good movie nevertheless, but do not allow yourself to be distracted from truth as a result of purely emotional liberal fear mongering.  Tread lightly.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Firstly, let me say that this is one of the most controversial movies to come out in a while, not because of the subject of the content, but the quality. I personally adored this movie. Ewan McGregor (in my opinion one of the best actors of his generation) and Nicole Kidman (who before this I had grossly underrated) are right on target. The chemistry between them is electric, as is the rest of the film.<br />Though the Moulin Rouge is more of a dark, hellish place than an actual night club, it pulses with life, color and excitement. The world that Baz Lurhmann created is unimagineable, and the music is woven into the movie with flare and style. The soundtrack has everything from a heart-wrenching original song to an out-of-the-blue rendition of \\"Smells like Teen Spirit\\". <br />The supporting players also delivered top notch performances, Jim Broadbent as the electrifying Harold Zidler, John Leguizamo as the endearing, odd Toulouse Lautrec and Richard Roxburgh as the extraordinarly evil and weak Duke.<br />Overall, I thought Moulin Rouge was \\"spectacular spectacular,\\" beautifully done, fantastic characters (if not a few too many cliches) and acting at its best. This movie is like a chocolate/ lemon cake with rasberries on top: rich, spirited and deep red.
B0000542D2|4.0|I sure am glad I raised my 14, 11, and 6 year old children right! Musically, their tastes range from Nirvana to Gaelic Storm to The Moody Blues to Glenn Miller to Bill Monroe to Jimmy Eat World and on and on. But just ask them who their favorite group of all time is and they'll let you know without hesitation that it's The Beatles. So it was with great anticipation that we all sat down in front of the telly and watched A Hard Day's Night tonight. I purposely have not watched this movie in years because I knew that one day it would be out on DVD, and that time is here and now. In glorious black and white John, George, Paul and Ringo burst onto the screen with all of their music and mayhem that was Beatlemania. No need to repeat what this flick is about - that's been done on countless other reviews - but I will say that the  picture quality is phenomenal, the sound is so-so (especially on Can't Buy Me Love - like it came off of a vinyl bootleg record), and the extra's are fair. I particularly love the Liverpudlian accents and humor - and there IS loads of humor. George, the \\"quiet Beatle,\\" especially, comes off hilarious in his dead pan comedic style. The story line is very basic, but holds the viewer throughout. To me, this movie is better and funnier now than when I first saw it on television back in the early '70's. (Imagine how even better this movie will be when my 2 year old is a teen!). The reason why I gave this movie a 4 is because of the sound and extra's. Could've been better. But the movie itself is absolutely GREAT!<br /><br />To the younger viewers (and listeners)of this movie and Beatles music in general: remember this about this band - for their time, absolutely no one could compare with them. When looking at music charts of the Beatle era, for instance, you will notice that the other top selling songs of the day were so far behind what the Beatles were doing. While Ricky Nelson was singing \\"For You,\\" the Beatles were belting \\"It Won't Be Long.\\" While the Newbeats were singing \\"Bread and Butter,\\" the Beatles were cranking out \\"Tell Me Why.\\" Now, don't get me wrong, I like the above mentioned non-Beatle tunes, but when you compare other songs of the period to what the Beatles were doing, well, there is just no comparing, especially in the late 1965 through the 1967 period. (\\"Rain\\" was on the same chart as \\"Lil Red Riding Hood\\" by Sam the Sham. Talk about night versus day when it comes to musicianship and lyrics!).<br />I think it can be safely said that virtually all pop and rock music (aside from techno or rap) that came out after 1964 had a Beatle influence to some extent, from Frank Sinatra to Classical to even Country. That's quite an accomplishment. Even 'A Hard Day's Night' had a major influence on rock and roll movies and TV shows - just ask the Monkees.<br />Anyhow, check out this great flick and see the beginnings of a phenomena that still shines as brightly today as it did nearly 40 (!) years ago.Newbeats were singing \\"Bread and Butter,\\" the Beatles were cranking out \\"Tell Me Why.\\" Now, don't get me wrong, I like the above mentioned non-Beatle tunes, but when you compare other songs of the period to what the Beatles were doing, well, there is just no comparing, especially in the late 1965 through the 1967 period.

B000068OCS|5.0|If we sent this film to another solar system, and an intelligent species found it and watched (and heard) it, that civilization would have a very clear concept of what our planet and what modern human beings are all about without any exchange of spoken or written language. That is how simply and profoundly this film communicates its portrait of our world. I first saw it as a rental in the 80s; my Dad somehow thought it was a science fiction film. But as we watched it, we were absolutely mystified and awed. Yes, its message is obvious, but seeing this film one is confronted with the beauty of our world and the horrific excess of human civilization in a unique way. The Philip Glass score is wonderful and highly appropriate (I enjoyed his music in this setting far more than I ever did on its own), and the time-lapse sequences, particularly toward the end, are dizzying and bewildering. While one is struck by how dated many of the images of American society are - looking back on the early eighties - and one is aware that many environmental abuses have since been tamed somewhat, one also realizes that little has changed fundamentally in the past two decades, and that many things the film depicts merely hint at developments which are now seemingly insurmountable problems. A monumental film, and I look foward to the third part of the trilogy, \\"Naqoyqatsi,\\" coming to theaters in October 2002.
B0000542D2|5.0|This is pure joy, happiness, humor, innocence as well as cutting humor. My lord how I miss the Beatles and how amazing they were. It was sooo cool to watch this with my 15 year old son. That was aboout the age when I first saw this movie in the movies and I remember not being able to hear a word with the girls screaming. So natural and had such a improvisational look.<br />THANK YOU Miramax for reviving this classic for history's sake. The picture quality was fantastic and to hear those songs in stereo was fantastic. How on earth did these 4 guys from Liverpool change so much of our culture. Please, let there be some people who can be as amazing and transcending as the Beatles come again !!<br />That old man should have won the best supporting actor. Ringo was soooo funny. George ... well.<br />Tried to explain to my son that how their look was considered so anti-establishment, and controversial. They look so neat !!<br />I did cry a litle after, for the genius of the writing, the renevating of the classic and how sad, sad that George and John aren't here anymore.
B000068TPN|4.0|We Were Soldiers is a movie about the Vietnam Conflict that shows the first major engagement between US soldiers and the North Vietnamese Regulars.  The movie does an excellent job potraying the events of the first skirmish of the Ia Drang battle in 1965.  There are a few shortfalls though.  I have never been to Vietnam, or seen the real Ia Drang Valley, but Vietnam portrayed in this movie looks like California to me.  I was also dismayed at the Hollywood style ending of the movie.  I beleive that the screenwriter, who also happens to be the director, should have stayed true to the book.  The entire Battle of Ia Drang was over 35 days, whereas the movie only shows us the first three days.  Thus, the viewer gets a falsified sense of victory out of the movie.  Consequently, the movie is a good war movie; I would put it in my top 5 favorite war movies.
B00005B1W5|5.0|I saw this DVD for the first time last night and was sorry I waited so long that it seemed like a \\"time travel\\" experience (it was produced in 1997). This DVD not only has Taj Mahal and Forbidden City concerts on it, but it has added bonuses of an entire length documentary related to how the concerts came about, the musicians feelings about visiting China and India, and a separate interview segment with Yanni who shares his incredible home studio with the viewers. (Viewers please note:  The documentary, \\"No Boundries or Borders\\" so very well done, is located on the menu that comes up at the end of the concert's credits and is not found on the main opening menu.)<br />The quality of this DVD is superior to Yanni's previous Acropolis DVD (I recommend video only for that one). The DVD is an absolute jewel. The musicians, who were handpicked by Yanni from all over the world, are simply magnificant! I especially enjoyed \\"Dance with a Stranger,\\" \\"Love is All\\" and \\"Niki Nana.\\"  The female vocalists are supurb. It is a very exciting concert that flashes back and forth between China and India's audiences.  The music is so dramatic, that you'd expect to hear it in an Oscar winning movie!<br />This DVD is a piece of world history. It is the best value I've ever seen in a DVD. The documentary alone is worth the price of this DVD! Yanni made history with these performances and you will never find another DVD like this one -- ever! The man is a miracle, plain and simple.  I'm waiting for Yanni's next performance on Mars, the moon - who knows what idea he'll come up with next.
B0000542D1|5.0|although that helps too. Everyone's sugar-coated view of The Beatles was manifested in this movie. The boys were in their 20's when this was filmed, yet they playfully romp through this film like energetic 16 year olds. Of course, the most fascinating part of the film is the music--which is lip synched by the Beatles on film yet compensated for by the wonderful photography and shots of their faces. Each Beatle's personality was taken and exaggerated to the point of caricature for the sake of humor, yet the Liverpudlian wit was not at all an imagined element of The Beatles.<br />Ringo Starr was hailed as the &quot;next Charlie Chaplin&quot; for his role in the film. Indeed, he was a natural on film but so were Paul's wide-eyed innocent glances, John's rascally smirks, and George's deadpan quips.<br />A true classic.
B000000W5P|5.0|Some Girls was originally released June 9, 1978, it went to #1 in the US and #2 in the UK. This is their best selling album ever (>8,000,000 copies to date). Although the Stones seemed to be on somewhat of a female bashing kick (and certainly aroused intense ire among feminist groups) with their billboards for Black and Blue and the album cover for some Girls (which produced lawsuits and a revised cover), the sessions for Some Girls were the most productive the Band would ever have and saved the Stones from oblivion. The album included not only the superhit Miss You (their first #1 hit in 7 years), but Beast Of Burden (Keith's tender last love song to Anita Pallenberg), When The Whip Comes Down, Shattered, Before They Make Me Run, Respectable, and Just My Imagination. Most people know the music, so in my reviews I try to give you data on the sessions and interesting facts connected with the songs and the album. Here we go:<br />Interesting notes include:<BR>.....the most famous story about Some Girls concerns the cut-out cover which originally had images of Lucille Ball, Raquel Welch, Farrah Fawcett, and Sophia Loren, all of whom threatened legal action, causing a revised cover to be released (both the original and revised covers from the original vinyl album are easily available on e-bay and in vinyl shops)<BR>.....the original album cover was issued in 3 different color variations<BR>.....Keith argued (and won) to have Start It Up removed from the album because he was afraid he had copied the main riff from the radio (it turned out it was his own licks he had heard)<BR>.....when asked by a reporter why the name Some Girls had been chosen, Keith replied, \\"Because we can't remember their (freak)ing names!\\"<BR>.....the first Stones disco mix was made by Bob Clearmountain from a tape of Miss You<br />The sessions for Some Girls were the most productive the Stones would ever have. They started in Paris Oct 10, 1977 and ended Mar 2, 1978 with final mixing at Atlantic Studios in New York Mar 15-31, 1978. The sessions were:<BR>Oct 10 - Dec 21, 1977 at Pathe Marconi/EMI Studios in Paris<BR>.....Miss You (Mick on guitar)<BR>.....When The Whip Comes Down (Mick on guitar)<BR>.....Just My Imagination (Mick on guitar)<BR>.....Some Girls (Sugar Blue on harmonica, Keith on bass & acoustic, Ron on acoustic, Mick on guitar, Bill Wyman on synthesizer)<BR>.....Lies (Mick on guitar)<BR>.....Far Away Eyes (Mick & Keith on piano, Ron on pedal steel)<BR>.....Respectable (Mick on guitar)<BR>.....Beast Of Burden<BR>.....Shattered (Ron on bass, pedal steel, and lead guitar)<BR>Jan 5 - Mar 2, 1978 at Pathe Marconi/EMI Studios in Paris<BR>.....Before They Make Me Run<br />Everything Is Turning To Gold was also recorded (it was released as a B side and special collections track).<br />Tracks from these sessions that were never released included the famous Claudine (which was never released because it was sure to cause litigation from Claudine Longet after she was reprieved from killing her boyfriend), plus Everlasting Is My Love, Covered In Bruises, Indian Girl, Misty Roads, Jah Is Not Dead, We Had It All, Fiji Gin, I Can't Help It, Do You Think I Care, The Way She Held Me Tight, I Need You, Let's Go Steady, Petrol, No Spare Parts, You Win Again, It's A Lie, It's All Wrong, Never Let Her Go, Never Make You Cry, Not The Way To Go, Biscuit Blues, Disco Music, When You're Gone, Angeline.<br />This information comes from \\"It's Only Rock And Roll: The Ultimate Guide To The Rolling Stones\\" by Karnbach and Bernson and from my own collection.
B00006AFUR|5.0|30 Seconds To Mars is without a doubt the best new band I have heard for the past few years.  With a futuristic twist and just the right touch of 80's synth, these musicians have tapped into somewhat forgeign territory for the music industry.

With the opening synth crescendo of \\"Capricorn\\", you begin a journey of self-transformation, alienation, unity and sexual appetite.  Thirty Seconds To Mars will take your hand and guide you through their world up until the last track, \\"Year Zero\\".  The entire album grasps your mind and senses instantly and guides you to foreign destinations and new worlds.  When the album is over you find yourself as you always were, never having left where you began.  But with Thirty Seconds To Mars you'll be asking yourself 'Or did I?'  Make one of the best purchases you can this year.  Pick up a copy of 30 Seconds To Mars and let yourself go.  Take the journey.  Welcome To The Universe.

B000022TSY|5.0|With a low budget and an inspired mind, Hopper and Fonda created a movie which is all raw talent, youth,and freedom. A  philosophical/psychadelic script (nominated for an academy award) describes precisely a unique part of modern society with nothing on their mind, but aspiration for creating a better future. Whether they are right or wrong, the film is an interesting document about America at the time of crisis, and the wishes of man to be released from cables of time and age.
0060194995|5.0|I'm not sure how much point there is to another review of \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\", since it's already well established as an American classic.  But here's my own take on it.<br />The quick plot summary is that a Black man, Tom Robinson, has been falsely accused of raping a white woman in Alabama in the 1930's.  Atticus (and like most people, I can think of Atticus only as Gregory Peck) is a lawyer who has been appointed by the court to represent the defendant.  The story revolves around how Atticus, his family, and his friends deal with the racial hatreds and other social conflicts that result from his participation in the case.<br />It's hard to imagine how a book can be any more perfect than this one.  On every basis - plot, setting, characterizations - it is a smashing success.  But I suppose if there is one thing that stands out over everything else in the book, it is the wonderful (and not so wonderful) people who populate its pages.<br />The story is told through the eyes of Atticus's little daughter, Jean Louise (nicknamed \\"Scout\\"), who is probably the most realistically appealing child in any novel I have ever read.  Lee doesn't over-romanticize the wisdom of a child, as many authors do.  Any parent, or anyone who has experience with children, knows that children are NOT unspoiled creatures, free from the prejudices and selfishness that have to be taught by adults.  Scout and her older brother Jem are completely natural characters, recognizable to all of us who remember our own childhoods.  But because of the circumstances into which they are thrown, the two of them emerge as nothing short of heroic figures.<br />But there are so many other memorable characters that it seems impossible that this novel could be only 323 pages long.  There is Scout and Jem's annual summertime friend, Dill.  There is the family maid and de facto female head of household, Calpurnia.  There is the painfully naive and judgmental Miss Caroline, a recent graduate from ed school whois assigned to teach Scout's first-grade class.  There is Boo Radley, the town's mysterious recluse.  There is the \\"white trash\\" family that started all the trouble with their accusation of rape.  Above all, there is Atticus himself, a figure of towering integrity, love, and loyalty.<br />As wonderful as the book is all the way through, I must call special attention to Chapter 15, where the eight-year-old Scout, with simple love and unconscious courage, tames a gang of thugs who have assembled at the local jail to lynch Tom Robinson.  (Classical music lovers who read this book might think of the chapter as a literary equivalent of the famous second movement of Beethoven's Fourth Piano Concerto.)  In my entire reading life, which covers more than fifty years and thousands of books, I have never read a more moving passage than this one.<br />It is inconceivable that a writer who could create so many memorable characters in so few pages would have confined herself to this one novel as her lifetime output.  But she did.<br />So how good is this book?  I used to have three all-time favorite novels (Tom Jones, And Ladies of the Club, and Lonesome Dove).  Now I have four.

B000069AUI|5.0|...I'd have to say that this is an overall better album than Parachutes, but they are both two of my favorite albums. However, A Rush Of Blood To The Head is much heavier than Parachutes (Politik comes to mind...) and it looks as though Coldplay has matured since 2000 and their lyrics seem more emotional and meaningful. When I first saw the video for \\"In My Place\\" and when I heard it on the radio, I knew that this album was going to be great. And I was right, because on this album, there are no tracks that you need to skip, there's no filler, no cliches, no repeat sounds. Since every song is good, it's hard to pick out the stand out tracks, but I'll just name a few. First, there's no ignoring \\"Politik\\" with its rising piano/guitar/bass/drum crecendoes then the slow voice parts. It's definitely not one to go unnoticed. \\"The Scientist\\" is another excellent track. It starts of as a slow piano ballad but rises into the whole band playing. \\"Warning Sign\\" is another great full-band song where Chris Martin's singing is really good. The title track and \\"Amsterdam\\" are also very, very good and emotional songs. Anyway, if you were turned off by the [slow] \\"Yellow\\" (which has now become one of my personal favorites), don't hesitate to by this album because this is very accessible. I highly, highly recommend buying this.
1402532903|5.0|I was first drawn to read this book because of a review that appeared in the Minneapolis Star Tribune. The subject matter piqued my curiousity. And the author's handling of the subject matter gripped me and I found myself thinking about the book while I was at work and I couldn't wait 'til I got home so that I could continue reading. I highly recommend it. It is an easy read, but that does not mean that the book is of light material. It is heavy and deals with a lot of emotions and a lot of issues that come up after a tragedy such as this - the rape and murder of a children - and the apparent injustice that so often prevails. Whether one believes in a life hereafter or not, I think this book sets one to thinking....
B000069I1H|4.0|This was an interesting comedy that looks at how the media can overwhelm fighting crime.  Deniro and Murphy are joined together to make a action-packed crime fighting television show that follows the pair on actual crimes and investigations.  Eddie Murphy was very entertaining as usual and it was fun to see Robert Deniro take his well known 'serious side' and try to loosen up.  Eddie Murphy in this movie tries to play to the camera while Robert Deniro can't stand being filmed or being on television which makes for a conflicting dual which puts the fun into this movie.  I was impressed with this movie and liked the appearance from William Shatner which I thought made the movie even more funny!  This movie never drags and there are many laughs that await you!

B00000JMOF|4.0|Frankenstein had life before this the second filmed version of Mary Shelley's novel (the first was a lost silent film). Originally Robert Florey was slated to direct and a young screenwriter by the name of John Huston had a hand in the early screenplay. Bela Lugosi was offered the role and it was announced as his follow up to Dracula. All of this, of course, never happened. Lugosi chose not to do the film and Florey moved along with him to his next project.<br />Stage director James Whale had just made his first feature film and chose Boris Karloff to play the monster. He cast Karloff after making a number of sketches of the actor's face in the role. Two careers were born along with the Monster. John Balderston's adaption plays fast and loose with the source material but it works. Jack Pierce's make up for Karloff was astounding for its time rivaling the best work of Lon Chaney.<br />The film is a bit stiff and static but then so were many early talkies. The sound cameras were too cumbersome to move around a lot. Still, the photography and Whale's direction are both strong. It's clear, though, that Whale is still a little unsure of himself as a director as the film is packed with dialog (much of it unnecessary). Performances are uniformly excellent with Dwight Frye notable for his scenery chewing as the hunchbacked assistant to Dr. Frankenstein. Colin Clive plays Frankenstein as a jittery, nervous high strung individual (much like Clive himself no doubt).<br />The extras are great on the DVD. The commentary is always interesting and provides much insight into the era (including the difficulties when the film was reissued. The Hays Commission dictated that the film be edited prior to re-release eliminating the sequence between the Monster and the little girl at the well). Frankenstein isn't Whale or Karloff's best film but clearly one of their most important.
B000002MJC|5.0|This album has such a unique and amazing sound to it.  You can tell that each sound created in this album benefits the feel and the art of each song.  Each song is a web that is spun to create a dark and deceitful poem.  As a writer of poetry, this album has hit my soul more than any other album I have ever listened to.  I would urge anyone who has an opened mind, to explore Depeche Mode.  They have expanded my mind musically and poetically.  European music is a breed of its own.  One really has to get into that vibe to understand where the music is coming from and where it is going.
B000035Z3K|3.0|Taking liberties with Stoker's novel, John L. Balderston's adaption of Dracula works best during the opening sequence. Changing around the characters a bit, Browning's film has Renfield show up at the Castle. The character of Jonathan Harker never leaves England. It takes some of the dramatic edge off the material although it makes it a bit more surprising.<br />I grew up watching this film along with the classic cavalcade of stars that played the roles in Universal's films. Lugosi does a credible job considering that he learned his lines phonetically and had never spoken English before. Browning's film captures the eerie atmosphere of Stoker's novel at the beginning before becoming a stage bound snoozer. The rest of the film lacks the spark of imagination that is apparent in the early scenes.<br />In many respects, the Spanish version is superior. Using the same sets and shot at the same time (although it was shot at night and during breaks in the shooting of the english version). The direction is crisp, tight and the visuals have all the flair missing from Browning's film version. The performances are quite good given the time the film was made (1931). There are a few scenes that are as static looking as Browning's film but, on the whole, the Spanish Dracula is a treat.<br />The extras that come with this DVD do much to enlighten the circumstances under which these films were made. Ironically, Lugosi was typecast with his very first talkie (he had appeared in a couple of American silent films before this)and yet he only played the role one other time (in Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein over two decades later). He did play a vampire in Browning's tepid mystery Mark of the Vampire. Lugosi would eventually appear in the follow up role of Frakenstein's Monster that he turned down after this film. Actually, it's better that Lugosi didn't appear in Frankenstein; Robert Florey was to direct and it differed quite a bit from James Whale's classic film. Ironically, if Lugosi hadn't passed on the role Boris Karloff's career wouldn't have surpassed Lugosi's.Lugosi hadn't passed on the role Boris Karloff's career wouldn't have surpassed Lugosi's.

B000002I53|5.0|there aren't many artists who have produced five-star albums that are not among their best work, but that can sincerely be said for trane's 1961 offering, 'My Favorite Things'. whereas it pales slightly compared to the obvious peaks in 'a love supreme' (one of the most astonishing albums - in any pop genre - ever made), 'ascension', and 'giant steps', what was intended originally as a low-key covers record emerges as a marvelous, exploratory work that towers over the best that the rest of the jazz world had on offer at the time.<br />the album is split into two, mostly musically symetrical, sides. each side features a searching improvisation first followed by a significantly more straightforward ballad statement. to say nothing of trane's playing, both sides feature some of mccoy tyner's most distinctive, emotive, percussive and technically majestic playing. this album reflects well on the entire quartet, though bassist steve davis is a less interesting , less melodically adventurous player than jimmy garrison, the man who would become most associated with trane on the double bass. he keeps a good pulse though.<br />side one starts off with the title track, which came to be something of a signature tune. it's unsurprising, given the quality of this number; trane brilliantly shakes the song free of its show-tune origins and turns it into an emotionally complex, alternately brooding and celebratory raga-waltz. the arrangement wrings the most out of the E major - E minor dynamic shifts throughout the song. much of roger mcguinn (the byrds)'s playing style is accounted for in trane's definitive soprano sax runs here. tyner shines too, but it is trane's exultant playing on the extended fade that sells this album still. a suitable moment to catch one's breath follows in the form of a gorgeous but conventional take on 'ev'ry time we say goodbye'. an unusually lush and sensitive performance, it should have been released as a single. the arrangement isnt much different fromthe original, with trane's soprano taking the place of the vocal, but there is a nice solo by tyner and some interesting modal melodic variations here and there.<br />side two begins with the careening, wildly dissonant take on 'summertime'. this take is primarily a showcase for some transcendent work by the rhythm section, although trane and tyner both showcase extended, angular soloing on the album's most radical statement. the finale, 'but not for me', is a potent modal swinger similar to the uptempo numbers on herbie hancock's 'maiden voyage' (an amazing disc, itself more than three years away from release at the time of this album's bow).<br />all in all, this was one of the first great albums of the 1960s and makes a beautuful introduction to trane's somewhat more accessible side to the curious, as well as reaping quick, tremendous emotional and musical dividends to those already converted.

0198534469|5.0|I have recently finished reading this book cover-to-cover and, in spite of having worked<br />in mathematical physics for 40 years, feel compelled to gush like a teenager. It is mighty<br />therapy for a generation raised on conciseness, abstruseness, abstraction and Bourbaki.<br />Possibly one cause for this sorry state of affairs (there are others, but I'm in a generous mood!)<br />is the vast mass of knowledge that has to  be mastered by modern devotees.  But, like any fashion, this<br />one has taken on a life of its own. A friend who works at MIT recently showed a book to a young post-doc,<br />claiming it was a \\"friendly\\" introduction to such-and-such. Without even glancing at the evidence, the<br />hot-shot replied that if it was all that friendly, it couldn't possibly be any good!<br />Needham takes you back to an earlier sensibility, naive and profound in equal measure,<br />tackling problems leisurely with nothing but your own intuition and a few simple facts<br />from geometry. Following his guidance, you understand the solution several times from<br />different angles and come out with that intoxicating feeling of \\"owning\\" the entire<br />thing, not as a means to an end (publishing, accolades, ...) but as a thing of beauty. It's<br />hard to believe, but early masters like Newton actually managed to understand vast and<br />complex fields of science in this very tactile way. That art, largely lost, has been revived<br />lately by a select few including Needham and Chandrasekhar (Newton's Principia for the<br />Common Reader, Clarendon Press, 1997). I've made a complete mess of my copy: margin notes,<br />sketches, ... and probably a few drool marks. Let's hope this starts a movement. If there is a way<br />to save American math education, this has got to be it! Thanks, Tristan.
B00006AG5N|5.0|Elvis is still with us! This is a terrific remix and Elvis sounds better than ever! No one sounds like Elvis and it's great to hear &quot;The King&quot; even after all these years.These 30 songs,plus one remix,are exceptional. This will intorduce &quot;The King&quot; to an entire new generation of fans. Well done RCA/BMG.
0553579908|5.0|&quot;A Clash of Kings&quot; keeps going where Martin's other book &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; left off. This book, like his others, has plenty of action, intrigue, adventure to keep any fantasy fan hooked. Martin does a wonderful job bringing us to terms with the characters that he has created. His unique character-based chapters don't take away from the story at all, they only succeed in planting the action right infront of the reader.<br />There are now four kings buying for the rulership of the kingdoms. Stannis, Renley, Joffrey, and Robb Stark. All of them want what the others have. But to make matters more exciting, the blood of the old rulers is returning. Dany, Mother of Dragons, is returning to reclaim her rightful place on the throne. The kingdoms seem to be in chaos, who will come out on top. While &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; seemed more of a precurser to future events. This book actually brings those events to life. Armies meet, kings fall, there is no end to the action. <br />&quot;A Clash of Kings&quot; succeeds in bringing together real life emotions, with everyday horrors. This book moves the epic story along, and some things are solved, while other problems are just beginning. Who will come out on top? What of the problems in the North? And what about those words that should freeze the blood of the battling kings... &quot;Winter is coming...&quot;
6305265666|5.0|What can I say...I've watched this movie over a dozen times and could watch it a dozen more!  It is that beautiful!  As well as being funny and touching.  This film has wonderful actors and actresses.  The scenes are gorgeous.  The story, well, its not your basic 'Cinderella' story.  Danielle, (Drew Barrymore) is the ultimate 'Cinderella.'  The 'evil step-sisters' are also different from the norm.  One is nice and the other is actually prettier than 'Cinderella.'  The Prince, well he is a bit of a new sort as well.  He's searching for something more then looks! He's looking for what 'Danielle' (Barrymore) has...brains, passion for life, strong will and confidence.   The evil stepmother is just that, evil.  Nothing different there, but I find this version to be fresh, original and wonderful!  I highly recommend this film to everyone,  families, romantics, everyone!  Five stars isn't enough!  This movie will, for 'Ever After,' be one of my top 10 favorites. :)
B000002UJQ|5.0|This is a weird CD. Any person who has stuck with punk music and Britney SPears will not like it at first. Some songs have a psychotic feel (climbing up the walls, paranoid android), and others are almost impossible to listen to at first (fitter,healthier). But in the end, they have the most powerful message in music ever. The message is displayed clearly in no suprises, another song that's not immediatly catchy. You'll have to figure out the message yourself, but it's important for this day and age. <BR>I love every single song on this album, but they're not backround music. I've also listened to Pink Floyd, but I don't see the simularities. There's no crazy guitar parts in Floyd, and the messages are a little too outright for my taste, not to say that<BR>Pink FLoyd isn't a great band. Buy this CD. You'll regret it if you don't.
B00005214X|5.0|Paul wrote the most commercial post-Beatles songs, John the most artistic, and Ringo sang the most humorous.  George?  He always meant it the most.  You know where you stand with George Harrison's music.  He sang with his heart on his sleeve and a crooked smile on his face.  Triumphant rhythm guitar and some fantastic solos.  This is one of the finest albums ever recorded.
B0000020C4|5.0|Finally, a good Eponine. Unlike many other performers, Lea Salonga gives what is for me a pleasing portrayal of Eponine. She manages to avoid the usual sulkiness and whining tone that many actresses seem to adopt with this character. Just wonderful!
B00005OWEG|5.0|I love this movie.  It's weird.  It grabs the back of your brain and it won't let go.<br />It has quite the same effect as Conrad's &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;.<br />So to that end, Cappola brings a trip up the African Congo into the 20th century with a US Navy river boat in Viet Nam.<br />The restored scenes add quite alot to the movie, but the price paid is in seat time.  This is a l-o-n-g movie and not many people will sit through it.  But, as &quot;Gandi&quot; and &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; demonstrate, a good story takes time to tell.
B00005OAIE|5.0|John Mayer's debut album is a breath of fresh air.  His voice has an honest huskiness that hides no pretenses and amplifies the sincerity in his lyrics.  The music itself is one-of-a-kind.  It is relaxing melodies and is emotionally-charged at just the right times.  His lyrics also offer us some surprisingly wise insights with a youthful perspective.  And their imagery is full-bodied.  I would absolutely melt if someone had written &quot;Your Body is a Wonderland&quot; for me.  <br />Mayer is clearly an up and rising balladeer for the new generation.  Each song on this album is a keeper!
B00006JDVV|5.0|I found the movie wonderful.  Saw it 4 times at the movies, and would have seen it more if it had stayed longer.  It had a moment or two where you questioned the garden field being a long distance away.  It had good strong actors and the director knew what he wanted.  I rate this a 10.
B00005QG9J|2.0|If you want this cd, i owuldnt argrue with your opinion or anything, but if you're reading this, i would recommend with a passion tht you dont take the time or money needed to buy this. I mean really. In my opinion, theyve odne anything but matured since the early days. I'm a S.C.I.E.N.C.E. fan basically, and after that i could perosnally live without this band or thier brothers audiovent. Warning and Nice to know you were the ony songs on the album i ever really liked. Break away from the mainstream and listen to filter or something
B00003CXAE|1.0|I was very disappointed in the process used to transfer to DVD.  The print that was transferred to the DVD appears to be somewhat faded and dirty.  However I was most disappointed with how grainy the movie is, I have seen movies that twice as old and older that had better transfers.  One other note; for some reason in all of the shots that were in the soda shop they having digitally blurred out the Coca-Cola logo in signs and menu boards.  This is distracting!
B00005JKHP|5.0|I like this movie much more than the movie I saw in the theater in 1979.<br />It makes more sense.  It looks better.<br />It is still not very good Star Trek.<br />And so I am giving it a 5 Star rating only because it fills in a part of the archaeological record of Star Trek, not because it is an inherently good film.<br />Call me low brow, but Robert Wise erred when he decreed that Star Trek, The Motion Picture was a &quot;MOOVIE&quot; and not a television episode.<br />I wanted the old music.  I wanted the old sets.  I wanted the old action.  I wanted excitement.<br />STTMP was a boring movie, ponderous in its irrelevancy.<br />But without this, there would be nothing else.
B000069AUI|3.0|When British band Coldplay first burst onto the American music scene in 2000 with their hit &quot;Yellow&quot;, entertainment critics hyped them up to be one of the worlds greatest bands. I didn't belive the hype until I bought the incredible album Parachutes. With their smooth, mellow brand of rock music lacing each track of the album, it was clear that I had become addicted to the music. Of course I bought the second album A Rush of Blood to the Head with anticipation of it being just as stunning as the first; only to be left in disappointment.<br />Don't get me wrong, the album is still very good and well written, but nothing on here can really touch the material presented on their debut, besides the album's best track &quot;In My Place&quot;. The album, like the first, is very heavy on the ballads, but unlike the first not all of them are good. &quot;The Scientist&quot; is a fantastic track, but songs like &quot;Daylight&quot; &amp; &quot;Green Eyes&quot; just didn't tickle my fancy. The hard rock on &quot;Politik&quot; is hopefully not a new trend of their music, because its highly unwelcomed. I found myself getting into &quot;Warning Sign&quot; &amp; &quot;Clocks&quot; respectively. I didn't much care for &quot;Whisper&quot; (which sounded like something the Hives would have done), but I like how the album was finished with &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot; &amp; &quot;Amsterdam&quot;.<br />Overall, Coldplay did an OK job, but just not what I was expecting. Maybe I was expecting to much out of the album and thats why I was disappointed, however fans of the first album &amp; new fans alike will enjoy the music on here. With beautiful lyrics about love, life and political issues laced with an amazing band Coldplay is not going anywhere anytime soon and its exciting when I think about the levels this band will reach in the future. Trust me, do not sleep on this band, they WILL be legends.
B00004XONN|5.0|This is great electronica, and half the world can appreciate it. I like kid a, everything in its rigth place, how to disapear completely, and the national anthem. My fourth grade art teahcer, yea,kinda odd, was a radiohead fan. I listened to radiohead night after night on the internet trying to find out why he liked it, then, boom. Radiohead was my favourite band. The first and best radiohead song i liked was the national anthem. The whole album is good, so rockers, country fans, seventies fans, whatever, buy it
B000002RXS|3.0|As much as a Callas fan that I am, I find this set, callas worst recording. She portrays the character incredibly good as always, but here I could here her vocal decline in those years. Its really a pity she didt made a recording of Carmen earlier in her wonderful carrer.<BR>The passages are really awfull I dont like to say this as a Callas fan that I am, but she really disapointed me vocaly in this Carmen. <BR>Gedda is one of the bests Don Jose I ever heard, really great and passionate and with a wonderful pronunciation.<BR>Massard really didnt convinced me as Escamillo, I think he could do better than this.<BR>The best things in this recording are Pretre conducting wonderfully, I think is the best conductor of Carmen I ever heard and Guiot who really made me almost cry at Micaelas aria.<BR>I can undestrand those who put 5 stars t this set, because Callas really acts with her voice and shows us why she was considered the best singing actess opera had, but for me here she cant disimulate her vocal decline by acting.<BR>There are better versions like de los Angeles, Gedda, Beecham or Troyanos, Domingo, Solti
0446530573|5.0|Allen Rucker has captured the Sopranos perfectly and the recipes are delicious.  You can really imagine each character in the book talking to Arite Bucco or writing their own section.   Tony's tips for controlling the heat on the grill are hilarious!  And Bobby Bacala's thoughts on dessert are equally funny. <br />But on top of this being a great book for any Sopranos fan, it is a great Italian cookbook on its own.  I cook Italian food all the time and I've already tested many of the recipes...and they are great!<br />Whether a Sopranos fan or a lover of Italian food, this book is a must for you!
B000069CWE|5.0|in my opinion... this is one kick ... cd! ... reanimation is just simply showing what Linkin Park is capable of, I think they aimed more for a hip hop crowd with this cd, Well anyways, this is an awsome cd! if your a real fan of Linkin Park, u dont wanna miss out on Reanimation.
B00005B4GU|4.0|The album amnesiac isnt your typical album. Its a classic album. Even the cover booklet is great. It features odd pitures and strange qoutes, both from the cd and not. It starts with &quot;Pakced like sardines in a crushd tin box&quot; which is a quite somple intro. It has some kind of harmonic or keyboard osund in the background as Thom says'I've been losing my mind, get off my case, get off my case' over and over. Then the catchy piano ballad &quot;The pyramid song&quot; which is quite emotional. Then the techno song &quot;Pulk/Pull revolving doors&quot; which finds radiohead giving a 'phat' beat and Thom using an odd vocal effect. &quot;You and whose army&quot; is a slow song with a kind of annoying, upbeat chorus, but i like the song. &quot;I might be wrong&quot; has a good repeated riff and vocals that can be kind of annoying. &quot;Knives out&quot; is a good song, i cant really describe it but its quite relaxing. Not that its boring or anything but I have fallen asleep listening to it and been woken by my parents like a track later. &quot;Morning bell/amnesiac&quot; is a re-make of a song from KID A. I really dont think too much of the new version. I also really dislike &quot;Dollars and cents&quot; with a passion. Then the filler song &quot;hunting bears&quot; whihc is just some odd guitar riff. Then Then the good, piano ladden &quot;Like spinning plates&quot; and &quot;Life in a glasshouse&quot; end the cd. I'd strongly recommend it to country fans, 70's fans, soft rock fans, atmosphere fans, or Metalheads like myself. But i wouldnt recomend it to a rap or rap rock fan. They wouldnt appreciate it for what it is. Basically its a great cd. Im not sure if its my favourite radiohead, but its still a great cd, screw favourites.
B00005RY7X|1.0|Wow, this is so cool. Especially because I hate all other music. All other music is whiny nu-metal, and anything with emotion is stupid. I think these guys have skills. Gotta love how every track sounds the same, and how the drumming never changes in any song (bass-snare-bass-snare-bass-snare). I can't wait until Andrew goes home one night and blows his brains out just like Kurt Cobain did. Only then will I get a party started.
0316666343|1.0|This book starts out extremely interesting and leads you to believe she will be able to help her family through the tough times.  The story was extremely disappointing and goes on and on without approaching the real subject.  I found the ending aggrevating and not worth my time of the entire read.  The publicity this book has had is ridiculous and people who actually read this book in it's entirety  I believe would feel the same.  This is one book I would recommend not believing in all the hype.  I bought it before it became so recommended and am still in awe at the push to sell this book.
0684869713|2.0|I am halfway through reading The Fountainhead and will probably stop reading it since I am so disappointed.<br />Given Rand's popularity, I was somehow expecting to step into an unexplored intellectual territory but I was mistaken. So far, The Fountainhead has been intellectually and philosophically unrewarding. The writing is not so bright either and I see no literary value in The Fountainhead.
B00005NWM3|4.0|It's a really good cd and i was attached to it until my brother broke it. It has some great riffs. The great riffs of just for, where do i hide, and never again will inspire you to purchase this. I would listen to the samples, but the average person, unless your not into rock, or if your into deth metal and stuff, could buy it and relate to my opinion
B00005Y6YB|5.0|Based upon the Pulitzer Prize winning novel, Lonesome Dove is the best adapted novel of all time for any screen.  I personally despise seeing any film based upon a novel that I have read due to the inconsistencies between the novel and the screen version.  Lonesome Dove, the novel, not only captures the spirit of the old west better than any other novel I have ever read, but the mini-series nearly follows the novel page for page.  <br />What makes the screen version so much better is the fact that the acting is first rate.  Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones  legitimized their casting with first rate performances.  Their roles were originally written for John Wayne and James Stewart, but I don't think that the performances of those actors could have equaled Duvall and Jones.  Diane Lane had the perfect demeanor for the beautiful but esteemless prostitute who is forever to be abandoned.  Robert Urich, the eternal good guy was perfect as the scheming weak-willed former Ranger.  I'm not certain how Lonesome Dove faired at the Emmy's, but it certainly should have won in every category for which it was eligible.<br />If you want to see a well acted tale of the old west in which the time period is legitimately portrayed, see Lonesome Dove.  If you don't want to be disappointed by a film that was adapted from a novel you have read, see Lonesome Dove.  There is no aspect of this film that takes away or attempts to enhance the novel from which it was adapted.  Do yourself a favor and see Lonesome Dove.
B000069AUI|3.0|After five minutes of playing name that influence with any band, you'll either keep listening to the CD or slag it endlessly.  With Coldplay's latest, I'm honour-bound to do neither, although I'm pleased that it's not the world-beater, all-conquering LP that the music rags have all championed it to be.<br />I for one, enjoy when a band kills the population the right way; with an album that stays in your collection longer than it takes for the pawn shop down the street to close down.  As it is, \\"A Rush of Blood...\\" will prove frustrating to those coming down off the high of 'Parachutes', but it's a decent holding action for the band.<br />That is, until they release their next one, which will be crucial.<br />There isn't a single tune that beats anything off their debut LP, and while it's not as over-produced as 'Parachutes', it's a little too pedestrian in its ambition to succeed for me to give it more than 3 stars.
B00005T30L|4.0|I kept putting off seeing this movie as the people who were recommending it to me liked so many \\"Hollywood product\\" type movies that seemed to be nothing but formulaic teen comedies.  When I finally saw it, I was impressed with it as I had been with few movies in the last year. The acting was perfect, the comedy fresh and edgy, the script an intelligent and sincere approach to the theme - not the usual annoying end-product  of marketing that Hollywood excels at vomiting out. As the film nears its end, it becomes a heart-filled story of maturing and growth. Enjoyable, funny, touching.
B00005JKJA|4.0|I knew before I watched this film that you either hated it or loved it, thought it confusing or brilliant, therefore I went in watching this with an open mind and... I loved it!<br />&quot;A love story in the city of dreams&quot; so the tagline goes.  Ha Ha.  David Lynch does have a sense of humor.<br />I was compelled with the story and Rita and Betty and the Director (Justin Theroux).  I wanted to know how all three of these people fit together and then came the blue box and everything shifted.  Wow!  Then I realized how everything fit together.  If you love movies with a little more intelligence in them, I highly recommend MULHOLLAND DRIVE.<br />My one gripe was that I wished a little bit more of the Diane and Camilla story were fleshed out more because I felt that Camilla was a little too cruel to Diane.  I wanted to understand why Diane would be involved with such a cold-hearted woman and why Diane would spend the first half of the film... well... I won't give anything away.<br />This one is a keeper.
B00005YTFG|1.0|Moulin Rouge is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  It is very long and very boring.  The movie bombards you with recycled old songs, bright colors, and frantic movements.  The movie can bombard you all it wants, but it can't make you care.  There is nothing to care about in this movie.  The characters are less than one-dimensional.  The writing is silly and predictable.  The direction is absolutely horrible.  The camera keeps jumping all over the place.
B00005JKJA|4.0|I cannot stop thinking about this movie.  After watching the movie, my first reaction was, \\"Um...What the heck just happened here???\\".  A co-worker even said to me, \\"The director of this movie should issue a formal apology to all who watched it!\\"  It was only after I watched it a second time, discussed every nuance over with a friend & other co-worker, and then purchased this movie that I came to understand it....to a point.  I still cannot, with confidence, say that I understand the blue box, or the Silencio part.  I have my theories, but they remain just that...theories.<br />If you want to simply sit on your couch and be fed a storyline with a nice beginning, middle and ending, then you will be disappointed.  Only by carefully examining reality, and the characters actions and motives can you understand what happens throughout this movie...in a retroactive way.  This is a great conversation piece because it is chock full of meaning and symbolism.<br />The only problem I have is with the DVD itself.  There are no chapters in this movie...only one long movie, as if you're playing a tape.  I think the director did this in order to make it as difficult as possible to figure this movie out.  But it is still quite annoying nonetheless.  Thus....4 stars.  It upsets me because I LOVE the part in Silencio where the woman sings a Spanish version of \\"Crying\\" (it's spine-tingling), and this part is toward the end.<br />This is not the type of movie that will leave you hanging.  Everything is there...you just have to figure it out.<br />I recommend this movie highly.
B0000027RL|5.0|&quot;Ten&quot; is obviously one of the most widely known and influencial albums of the grunge era (early nineties).  That aside, &quot;Ten&quot; is a lyrically intense and energetic album that doesn't fail to ensure a fullfilled listening experience.  Eddie Vedder delievers powerfull vocals over the top of the tremorring guitars of Stone Gossard and Mike McCreedy, and the bass of Jeff Ament.<br />Songs like &quot;Even Flow&quot;, &quot;Alive&quot;, &quot;Black&quot;, and &quot;Jeremy&quot; are historic rock staples, but only accounting for those four would be only a fragment of the rock.  Pearl Jam delivers a strong openning with &quot;Once&quot;, which introduces the mood for the rest of the album.  &quot;Even Flow&quot; and &quot;Why Go&quot; are fast-paced and hard-hitting.  Slowing down the moementum, &quot;Black&quot; focuses on pain dealing with love.  &quot;Jeremy&quot;, which is based on a true story, talks about a child who commits suicide in front of his class.  &quot;Oceans&quot; is soft and thoughtful.  The intensity of the album is boosted back up except in a darker with &quot;Porch&quot;, &quot;Garden&quot;, and &quot;Deep&quot;.  Finally, the album ends with Eddie Vedder spiritually talking to his passed-away father in &quot;Release&quot;.<br />This album is definitely a classic and a must for any grunge fan.  &quot;Ten&quot; was just the start of a string of Pearl Jam creativity of musical genius.  Newer albums are lyrically and instrumentally more complex, yet they have never achieved the stardom of &quot;Ten&quot;
B00006IU73|5.0|Whether you grew up listening to the fluid, multi-layered harmonies of The Beach Boys; the ever-changing, multi-passaged songs of Pink Floyd; Or the heavy, pre-metal sounds of King Crimson, you're sure to love this album.<br />From the opening guitar sequence on 'Blackest Eyes', you know you're in for a ride that won't let up and won't let down. Even when the songs take a sharp turn after just a few notes, going from a heavy thrash guitar riff to a melodic acoustic piece, you can't help but be carried along with it. The transitions are so fluid that neither the ear nor the mind will be complaining.<br />On songs like 'Trains,' the progressive nature of Steven Wilson's brainchild shine. The layer-upon-layer of acoustic guitars; The floating vocals; The harmonies, it's all there. Whether for the progressive purist or the casual listener, songs with such diversity and every-day appeal can't help but please both.<br />Perhaps taking a cue from the lessons that 'Lightbulb Sun,' Porcupine Tree's 1999 pop-experiment, the band seems content in taking their almost odd schemes to heart and embracing them for all their worth. Whether it be the almost unheard of rhyming system that vocalist/guitarist Steven Wilson has developed; The unorthodox bass style that Colin Edwin has developed that follows no root-note-only rules; Or the extremely detailed, please-your-ears style that new drummer Gavin Harrison has shown, the band is truly in top form.<br />Without becoming pretentious, the songs demand your attention from the get-go. Whether taking you for a thrill-ride of past metal glories on 'Gravity Eyelids,' telling you stories about an overly controlled life gone wrong on 'The Creator Has A Mastertape,' or speaking out against the many troubles of modern life (such as lack of privacy) on 'Strip The Soul,' this album will leave you thoroughly exhausted after listening.<br />All for the better, your ears and mind will thank you. Truly an album that can please anyone of any demeanor, you will not be disappointed after taking a good -listen- to this album. Not content to be just background music, it screams for more, and it's sound flows from the heart with a passion that is rarely felt on albums anymore. After taking a good listen to this and understanding all the -many- points the band has to say, you'll feel transformed. If not by the intricate lyrics and vocals, then by the amazing music that has been put forth by a truly talented band.<br />If you aren't truly invigorated after listening, then strip the soul indeed.<br />Enjoy.
B000002H72|5.0|This album is one of the pixies best.  It's one of the rare cd's or records (if your cool enough to have it on vinyl) that you can listen to the whole way through.  Black Francis' vocals are amazing as well is Kim Deal's backup.  I wish she sang more, but I guess that's what her side band is for.  If you like good music you should buy it...
B0000028UK|4.0|I've saved this PJ studio album as my last to review.  Why?  I'm pretty conflicted about this one.  When PJ first came out with &quot;Ten&quot;, I was listening but I wasn't hooked, didn't really believe the hype.  Then &quot;Vs.&quot; came out and I wore it out in my Discman sitting outside a tent in the desert of Egypt.  There was fury and anger aplenty and the album cover sums it up with a trapped sheep biting his way through the fence that boxes him in.  This was the band's statement at the pains of newfound popularity, but Vs. still yielded some radio friendly hits in &quot;Daughter&quot; and &quot;Elderly Woman...&quot; and &quot;Dissident&quot; helping to launch the CD to record setting quickest release sales.<br />So where's the confliction you may ask?  I don't feel like the band found their voice as yet.  In fact when I go back and listen to PJ CD's, this is the one I least often turn to.  Maybe I wore it out with over listening, but I don't think that's it.  I don't think the album as a whole has weathered well.  It's too straight-forward and doesn't allow the band to branch out, experiment, and find their unique contribution to the modernity of rock today.  With their third album, &quot;Vitalogy&quot; the band exorcised its demons and shrugged off the shackles of popularity leaving them truly finding their sound with their least-selling but best work, &quot;No Code.&quot;<br />&quot;Vs.&quot; looking back on it has some pretty remarkable tunes.  &quot;Go&quot; and &quot;Animal&quot; are as good of a 1-2 punch as rock-n-roll provides, but the true gem here is &quot;Rearview Mirror.&quot;  It stands up there with all time great &quot;car escape&quot; songs along with Rush's &quot;Red Barchetta,&quot; Bruce Springsteen's &quot;Thunder Road.&quot;  Though, this album as a whole hasn't aged as well as the rest of PJ's, this track is timeless.  Starting with a simple repetitive solo riff, the song builds and speaks volumes of movement, driving, escape.  By the end Vedder is screaming, &quot;Saw things so much clearer once you're in my rearview mirror.&quot;  The same shades that were drawn earlier in &quot;Daughter&quot; are now raised as Vedder takes us for a cathartic drive.<br />The album is good, but the band is not yet all they can be, all they will become.  Get &quot;No Code&quot; or &quot;Yield.&quot;  If you are new to PJ, go ahead and get &quot;Ten.&quot;  But if you are a fan, don't go on me and don't go without &quot;Vs.&quot;end Vedder is screaming, &quot;Saw things so much clearer once you're in my rearview mirror.&quot;  The same shades that were drawn earlier in &quot;Daughter&quot; are now raised as Vedder takes us for a cathartic drive.<br />The album is good, but the band is not yet all they can be, all they will become.  Get &quot;No Code&quot; or &quot;Yield.&quot;  If you are new to PJ, go ahead and get &quot;Ten.&quot;  But if you are a fan, don't go on me and don't go without &quot;Vs.&quot;
B0000029DD|5.0|Nearly ten years after it was released, Jeff Buckley's first and only official release, Grace retains its power and nearly mystical quality.  Grace is perhaps the best album of the nineties in terms of sheer power.  Even the most talented group of the grunge movement, Nirvana failed to deliver an album this musically interesting, lyrically accomplished, and just downright incendiary.<br />Sadly, this was Buckley's only official release, save \\"Sketches,\\" a double disc which captured Buckley's sessions for his second album.  His career was cut short short due to a drowning accident that left him dead at age 31.  Particularly tragic is that Buckley's father, the equally prolific Tim Buckley died young as well and haunted Jeff throughout his short life.  For further insight into both men, the book \\"Dream Brother\\" by David Browne is particularly knowledgeable and well-researched.  <br />It might be easy to remember the handsome, staggeringly charismatic, and tragically fatalistic Buckley as an iconoclastic figure of Rock `N' Roll; the Kurt Cobain who never was.  But the music Buckley left behind is far more dominant than any iconoclastic quality he had.  <br />Jeff Buckley left the musical world with a collection of 10 moody, spirited, brutally honest, even touching reflections on love, spirituality, and most chillingly, given his tragic fate, mortality.  The title track is particularly lugubrious, with Buckley ruminating over the appeal of death: \\"And the rain is falling/I believe my time has come/It reminds me of the pain/I might leave behind.\\"<br />Many have described Buckley's voice as \\"angelic.\\"  Perhaps this description can be attributed to his lack of natural limitations.  The uniqueness of his multi-octave range was simply otherworldly; in fact, no note was out of reach for Buckley.  He was a singer in the true sense of using voice as a handsome instrument, capable of achieving heights few have ventured to since.<br />If there is Buckley had it was juggling manydifferent genres into one cohesive flow of songs.  Buckley's voice handles the shifts beautifully, granting each song an appropriate, confident tone, be it metal (\\"Eternal Life\\") acid rock (\\"Dream Brother\\") choir music (\\"Corpus Christi Carol\\") or jazz (\\"Lilac Wine\\").<br />In virtually every category, Buckley proves his talent; as a guitarist, lyricist, melody-smith, and vocalist.  Grace is a brilliant album, bold, effervescent, and endlessly enlightening.  Buckley lives on.
0393317552|2.0|The plainly stated premise for this book is that there must be some reason provided, other than race, for the disparities we continue to see in the standard of living of various human populations.  And we learn that it is guns, germs and steel that allowed some people to conquer others and not the other way around.  Said guns, germs and steel having come into their possession first through having been luckier in where their ancestors happened to be living.  Sounds reasonable at first.<br />But having been conquered is not reason enough to give up on a good standard of living, and possession of guns, germs and steel is apparently not enough to guarantee a good standard of living either.  Since everyone has guns, germs and steel now, do they not?  And the French have been conquered at least every hundred years or so and continue to live like, well, western Europeans, so it is not merely being conquered that is enough explanation either.<br />So just what is it?  And I'll agree that it is not race.  Perhaps it is that some people simply won't accept the personal responsibility that would be required to get their act together, en masse, and well, quite frankly we can't force them to.  First of all it wouldn't work, this forcing them to.  Second of all, it would take too much time, this forcing them to.  What we are left with is, of course, their own personal responsibility to do it themselves or suffer the consequences.<br />Once we get past the fact that Jared Diamond tells us that watching TV causes brain damage and makes western children stupider then New Guineans, rather than TV being an ideal medium for enhanced learning.  Well, he's just mad because someone insulted his race and wants revenge on the matter, that's all, right?<br />Because if we take him on his word, we must look at our children with wonder because of how well they can function despite the \\"irreversible mental stunting associated with reduced childhood stimulation\\" caused by their TV watching.  Wealso must feel very sorry for how more backwards the New Guineans might become should they ever get TV's.  But we hope that in this part of the book only, he's not a complete idiot but still just rightfully infuriated at racists and that since this is just the introduction, that this must be only the editorial portion of the book and not an indication of a similarly biased book to follow.<br />He makes a lot out of plants that are domesticatable and those that are wild.  By definition the difference between domestic and wild implies that someone spent some time doing the domesticating.<br />While it is an appealing idea that some ancient primitives just happened to live near perfectly good grains such as in western Europe, well what about the Neanderthals?  Their fossil evidence now clearly indicates that they did not ingest any grains.  Were they blind?<br />And one must immediately ask, is the same wild relative of the grain plant ever found in America as western Europe?  A question he does not even address, taking it as a given.<br />But the whole idea is absurd!  All over the world, plants were domesticated, corn, wheat, rice, ad infinitum.  Are we to believe that domesticating wheat is so much easier than domesticating rice or corn that a 10,000 year advantage was gained?<br />Or the fact that wheat is now grown in Africa is proof that you cannot domesticate any African plants rather than that it was simply easier to bring some wheat seed with you, rather than start all over again from scratch?  Not because there are no plants that couldn't be domesticated, something different then corn, wheat or rice, but that rather that once their neighbors had already done it that it simply wasn't necessary to reinvent the wheel?<br />But what difference does it make anyway?  Europeans are not white because they are of a different species, they are white because of the perpetual lack of sunlight in the northern climes, particularly during the winter months and not only thatbut they have cloud covered springs, falls and summers too.<br />If two brothers, who both had the same mother, but each had different fathers of the same race, and one turned out to have invented a gun, and the other turned out to have been a shifty though intelligent bum.  Then perhaps by Jared Diamond's example, the shifty one should write a book why his excuse for being a shifty bum is not in any way genetic, and at the same time smear his brother's reputation at every possible opportunity.<br />I will admit that this book is fascinating in that he puts everything in terms of race.  So you can see not only which civilizations prevailed but also whose race bred with whose.  Unfortunately, he compiled these parts of the book from other people's historical works, although his one saving grace is that this was done rather well, since it makes an interesting read when compiled by virtue of race.<br />His facts then should be read with interest, but his opinions and conclusions with a grain of salt.<br />If you simply replaced every occurrence of contempt for eurocentrics with praise, and every occurrence of praise for New Guineans with contempt, and every instance of \\"luckier\\" with \\"smarter\\", then you would have the perfect book for the Reich mark to distribute to all newly married German couples along with their mandatory copies of Mein Kampf!<br />In regards to your theories, why do you even care, Herr Diamond?
B000069CWE|5.0|Alright alright i can understand why all u peoplez hate this cd... wait no i cant. I think linkin park is the only group i kno who can get away with taking an awesum song , and make it completely different and still come out with a hit. In my  opinion they had maybe one , at most 2 songs that didnt come out completely cool, so all u who keep comin on here and writin bad reviews why dont u just get ova it and go write a review for somthin else cuz i kno all u linkin park fans are gettin sick and tired of this....

B00005Q4CS|3.0|Requiem for a Dream doesn't so much try to convey the actual experience of being high (unlike Trainspotting) as much as it tries to show the different circumstances four addicts entangle themselves in as a result of their addiction. <br />Director Darren Aronofsky (of Pi fame) tries to distinguish his drug-themed movie from the pack by presenting the most gruesome, disturbing images possible of characters doing horrendous things to maintain their addictions.  <BR>As shocking and effective as many of these scenes are, Requiem for a Dream's ultimate failure is that its characters wind up secondary to the graphic imagery.  <br />Particularly hackneyed is the manner in which each character makes their dissent into hell.  Each downfall is categorized by the character's most obvious traits.  For instance, Mrs. Goldfarb (Ellen Burnstyn in a commanding body suit) has a frumpy plump appearance, so her downfall is connected to diet pills and losing that weight.  Marion (a brave Jennifer Connelly) is an attractive young woman, thus her vice relates to her sexuality (prostitution and bondage).  By this point, we realize that Marlon Wayans's character, according to Aronofsky's twisted formula, must have a downfall involving racism (by Confederate yokels no less!).  It's all a little silly to digest that every character's distinguishing quality is also related to their demise.  Something with a little more imagination would have worked just fine. <BR>   <BR>Surprisingly, no actual scenes depict the druggies getting high.  Five second jump cuts of dilated pupils, cocaine being snorted up a dollar bill, and the whirring of opening a pill container represent the act of using, which to Arofosky's credit, is an inventive and creative choice to avoid the familiar feel of other drug movies.  Essentially the drug addiction is portrayed less luridly than the sexual abuse which Marion endures, again ringing this film less relevant to drugs and more relevant to something which I haven't yetdecided; perhaps the buttons filmmakers can push to show the vulgarities of human nature.  Aronofsky's vision, while intriguing is quite unclear in purpose.<BR>  <BR>Contrary to what some admirers of the film have urged, I feel Requiem for a Dream would be a useless movie to show to teenagers in an attempt to dissuade them from potential drug use.  Essentially the main characters' reactions to their drug use are incredibly unrealistic.  And since the reaction vs. the experience is singularly what this movie considers, showing this film would serve little purpose to teenagers other than to present us with preposterous circumstances which the average teen (and person) would, most likely, find impossible to relate to.  Though a far inferior film, Traffic gives a more realistic depiction of young people being addicted to drugs (and a real yet balanced view of addiction that teens can relate to more easily).
B000065V3M|5.0|This film's 1994 release went largely unnoticed and scandalously unappreciated, except for Martin Landau's Oscar for his uncanny portrayal of Bela Lugosi. And that is a shame, because &quot;Ed Wood&quot; is Tim Burton's affectionate and well-done tribute to the man behind such movies as the immortal &quot;Plan 9 From Outer Space.&quot; Enthusiastic about moviemaking and wearing women's clothing, Wood never let an almost complete lack of talent get in his way, and it shows in his work. Who else would have a trademark confusion of day vs. night? Wood's movies are so amazingly bad they're often hilarious, and Burton was careful to let that part of Wood's life shine through.<br />Buena Vista is reportedly working on a long-overdue DVD version of &quot;Ed Wood,&quot; with lots of behind-the-scenes material. What would make it perfect if it were to include the three original Wood movies whose productions are depicted in the film: &quot;Glen or Glenda,&quot; &quot;Bride of the Monster&quot; and &quot;Plan 9&quot; itself. Hopefully, they will appear in this release or a later one.
B00006AG5N|4.0|Where is &quot;Always On My Mind&quot; on this compilation?..not too many better Elvis songs than that.  I recommend a compilation released in 1996 called &quot;The Essential Collection- 28 Timeless Classics&quot;.  It has excellent sound as well, can't see this album being any better. &quot;Essentials&quot; was numbered, and possibly was for a limited time so I am not sure to its availability.
B000023VR6|5.0|Forget the futurism of the title. Dre's always been a nostalgic sort, and 2001 provides a glimpse back to the glories of 1992's The Chronic. He's an ornery codger, too, though, and 2001 is a rap achievement of another sort - one where flying bullets cut through the dopey haze of aging memory. <BR>\\"I've seen them come / I've watched them go,\\" remembers Dre on the opening \\"The Watcher.\\" The original gangsta is now the original guru, imparting wisdom from his ranch somewhere in the smoggy mists of the Hollywood hills. It's a home built on pragmatism: the majority of that wisdom advises using Dre on your next album. This time around, the producer introduces a new persona to the rap game: the godfather too old to bang, and too wary to hand over his empire. It's not easy being an elder statesman. Like a reigning gunslinger, everyone wants to duel. And like any legend, Dre's in danger of being forgotten. Over skittering beats and Psycho-strings, he moans, \\"When my last CD was out, you weren't bumpin' me.\\"<br />Filled with ultra-violent fantasies warmed up by NWA's epoch-defining debut Straight Outta Compton, The Chronic was true manna from the 'hood. In it, Dre discovered a fresh voice in the half-croon of partner in crime Snoop Dogg. He also appropriated the sound of a thousand summers - P-Funk's full bass and organ frenzy. The old dog has new tricks for 2001, although on the evidence of its cinematic loops, most of them were road-tested by Wu Tang's RZA. Only \\"Let's Get High\\" revisits the Chevy-shuddering of yesteryear.<br />It's the perfect soundscape for the simmering paranoia that is L.A. at night. Dre walks its mean streets as a prophet carrying a massive persecution complex. While preaching monogamy on \\"F*ck You,\\" and revisiting South Central on \\"Still Dre,\\" his is still the wrath of God - burning down homes, setting off car bombs and threatening gangsta holocausts. His guest stars - among them Snoop and Nate Dogg - come to the party armed. <br />The Dre of 2001 isa Sam Peckinpah cowboy, an older man in a world that grew up without him. Can he change? On the concluding \\"The Message,\\" the answer is definitely maybe. With Mary J. Blige singing behind him, Dre mourns his dead brother. \\"I'm only half the man I was,\\" he rues, \\"I realize I ain't no gangsta.\\" Until the next episode, of course ...
B00004U8H4|5.0|Whether we know it or not, many of us have co-workers who are just like Patrick Bateman.  On the outside they exude confidence, style, and success, and they know exactly what to say and when to say it.  But on the inside lurks a fragmented soul ready to snap at any given moment.  Welsh actor Christian Bale, in one of the best performances you will ever see, brings to life Patrick Bateman, the Wall Street yuppie who works at Pierce & Pierce by day and is a serial killer by night.  In adapting the controversial and unpleasant book by Bret Easton Ellis, director Mary Harron purges much of the violence and misogyny that made the novel one of the most despised and misunderstood pieces of literature in the last 20 years.  What remains is the book's twisted sense of humor.  This isn't a slasher film but rather a clever satire on the yuppie lifestyle of the late 1980s.  Speaking in a pitch-perfect American accent that recalls a game-show host, Bale perfectly embodies his character physically and emotionally.  His performance makes you simultaneously laugh at, pity, and fear Bateman.  Jared Leto is also good in his brief role as Paul Allen (in the book it's Paul Owen; why his name is changed in the film, I don't know); Chloë Sevigny also stands out as Patrick's timid assistant, and Reese Witherspoon shines as his clueless and self-absorbed fiancee.  This is the unedited version, which has a few additional flashes of nudity in one of the sex scenes.  The difference is so minimal, you'd hardly notice it, showing how uptight the MPAA can get when it comes to editing films.  Nonetheless, \\"American Psycho\\" is a disturbing but clever film that was one of the best of 2000.  It comes highly recommended.
B0000541AM|5.0|Ok so what if some of the gangs look like refugees from the Rock Horror Picture Show? <br />This movie is manages to be violent and just fun at the same time, this seems to be a hard trick for movies to pull off nowadays.  <br />Overall-Great movie, kinda reminds me of New Jack City meets Mad Max.  If you want a good action flick get this one.  Its just a shame we don't seem much more of many of these actors.
B00005JKDR|5.0|The World of monsters is powered by children's screams and Sully (John Goodman) is the top scarer of them all.  Sully is aided by an one-eyed monster called Mike (Billy Crystal).  If a human child (or any item owned by a human child) enters the world of monsters, 23-19 is yelled and the CDA comes along and takes care of it.  A good and funny movie!
B00005Y1MT|5.0|I found out about this by simply seeing it is a local music store. As I regret to say, I didn't buy the album when I saw it. I just looked at it and thought &quot;What a cool looking cover!&quot; At that point in time I just starting to get into Marillion, so I neglected to buy it. I finally ordered this album online, and needless to say I am happy I did. This album is beautiful and emotional. It is a challenge to listen to if you have a patience level of -30. As Marillion keyboardist Mark Kelly said &quot;You must listen to this album in its' entirity. It's not a sound bite record with a collection of nice little ditties.&quot; This album is dark and symphonic. One of the single most emotional albums I have ever heard. Oh...and Steve Rothery (Marillion's guitarist) shocked the hell out of me with his virtuosity. Wow!
B00005U8EM|5.0|Phill Conners (Bill Muary) is a TV wheaterman that is assigned to cover the Groundhog Day holiday.  He is self-centered and doesn't much like Groundhog Day.  He goes through the first time being nasty and downright rude to everybody.  He goes to sleep, glad that the day is over.......or is it?<br />  He awakes to find that its Groundhog Day again and the same things happen also, people say the same things, nothing ever changes except Phill Conners.  He kills himself serveal times and different ways, but he can't escape from the time warp. It's always Groundhog Day.<br />  Finally, he does things right: he helps people, save a kid's life (the kid had never thanked him), saved Buster from choking on a steak and be all round nice guy and bingo, he's out of the time warp.  One of the best romantic comedies out there.
1577311523|5.0|I received the Power of Now and Present Moment Awareness as a gift several months ago.  The recommendation was to read Present Moment Awareness (by shannon duncan) first, and then to read The Power of Now.  <br />Present Moment Awareness was an awesome, very real world account of what it means to be present and peaceful, and a very eye opening look at how often we (I) live mired in fantasies and suffering.<br />The Power of Now then not only built upon the tools that Present Moment Awareness had given me, but showed the great possibilities open to me as I grow in my ability to stay present.<br />Honestly, this combination of books moved and empowered me in a way that no other book(s) have ever been able to do.<br />I will be giving both of these as gifts this holiday season to everyone I care about.  I highly recommend that you give yourself and anyone you love the same.
0805066349|5.0|I just finished Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee.  I'm astonished and disgusted.  I can't believe this topic is not covered better in school.  We spend all this time on the Civil War and then gloss over the native american wars.  I'm fairly disgusted with the federal government right now.<br />The native americans were astonishing people.  Think what they could have taught us.  It is very sad to know the fate of their great leaders, either assassination or death by mental defeat.  They were incredibly smart men.  You would have thought that some of our religious leaders would have been more brave and active in quelling the genocide.  This is very recent history for us, it occurred in my backyard here in Colorado, and yet it does not seem to be on our conscience.  <br />This is a great book.  I would recommend it to anyone.
B000003S0P|5.0|Sinister, swirling, stormy, _Red_ is the final album in the King Crimson lineup featuring Robert Fripp, Bill Bruford, and John Wetton. The band would break up after this release and not reappear for many years (see _Discipline_). While many 70s progressive rock releases sound dated today, _Red_'s brilliance is absolutely perdurable and still sounds vital and fresh. The same remains true with almost everything the band has done.<br />The instrumental title track is ominous and knotty, a prismatic miasma of jagged guitar and oceanic stringed instruments. \\"Fallen Angel\\" is Rock a la Crimson, one of their most 'ordinary' songs , but it is still edgy, moody, and a bit sad. Angular guitar lines screech along the tasty rhythmic grooves on \\"One More Red Nightmare\\", and by the end you are floating in spasmodic jazzy dissonance (saxophone!!! Rrroaw!). The awesome improv \\"Providence\\" begins like evil chamber music, and grows into nothing less than delirious sonic poetry. \\"Starless\\" is the album's masterpiece, opening on a mellotron's euphonious sussuration. This builds with foreboding texture on Fripp's pus-dripping guitar figure, then finally mutating into a ferocious mega-jam. When it all dies down, the finale deliquesces so precariously, so desperately. (If you don't like the one-note solo, you are unmetal.) This is a landmark progressive rock song, where composition and musicianship are all amazing. The remastered version sounds really good too.<br />Two bands basically define \\"progressive\\" for me. One of them is King Crimson. _Red_ remains (to me) one of their most essential and perfect albums, and if you don't own it you belong in the ghetto.
0064471837|5.0|I was at the bookstore, just bored because there hadn't been a real good fantasy book for a long time that I'd liked. I looked at it, and couldn't find -anything- on it that told me what it was about, but I still convinced my mum to buy it for me. I got home and read it to bits... I LOVE it. After that I began going on blind faith about books that looked really interesting. But I recommend this book to all my friends, -especial- the next of the series, Lirael.<br />Sabriel is about a very grown up child who has been living protected in Ancelstierre when she's suddenly laid up with the responsibility of her fathers bells and sword. With a few words that answers none of her questions, she decides to venture into the Old Kindom to search for him. Being chased by a great Evil, she knows there is more to the reason of his disappearance, but she knows barely anything of the Old Kingdom. Being even less informed of Old Kindom history, she tries to find answers to its confusing past, but there is little anyone can tell her for a spell binding the tongue, keeping the past locked safely away.
0671027344|5.0|This is the best book I've read in awhile. I especially like it because the setting is 1992; the same time I was in high school. It deals with a lot of issues, such as drug use and homosexuality. A worth-while read.
B00005RYLE|5.0|This movie is surely the best ever made, in my opinion. It's scary, gore... This movie will never be forgotten, because it's different from everything. Even its sequels don't get near it. Yes, I'm talking about The Evil Dead....<br />In this DVD, there are many extras, the best ones. There are exclusive extras, such as a documentary by Bruce Campbell (the actor who plays Ash, the main character in the trilogy), called Fanalysis. It's not an Evil Dead-only documentary, it tells things about fans, who they are, how far can they go. So the documentary shows many fans (from Star Wars, Star Trek, Xena...) in conventions... There's a participation of Sam Raimi's brother, Ted Raimi in this documentary also. The best documentary in my opinion is \\"Discovering the Evil Dead\\", because it tells the history about the movie, it tells things about how the censorship was, how it was released... You MUST see this documentary!<BR>There are Commentaries (well, they are the same from the Elite Entertainment edition DVD) of Bruce Campbell and another one with Rob Tapert (the producer) and Sam Raimi (the director). There are some rare behind-the-scenes footage (same from Elite Entertainment DVD), many pictures (not only from Elite Entertainment DVD), TV trailers, the trailer, bios of Bruce Campbell, Rob Tapert, Sam Raimi. It's a widescreen version (Evil Dead was never released in Widescreen format, until this DVD), it's closed-captioned. And there are much more extras.<br />Wait, this is the DVD, I didn't say anything about the awesome package yet. Well, I would buy this edition even without the DVD, because the book is really worthy. It's almost the same Necronomicon (Book Of The Dead) that appears in the movie. There are some pages of the book in the movie which doesn't appear in the DVD Necronomicon. And there's also some difference between them, because in the movie, you can't read what is written in the pages, but in the DVD Necronomicon, you can! And it's not hard! The book has thesame drawings from the movie, and there's a GREAT booklet in the book, also...<br />There are really no words to describe it. PLUS, a few years from now, it will be really hard to find, so it will be really expensive. But don't worry about it. You won't even think about selling yours.
0316666343|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I got it a few days ago, and was almost jumping with the anticipation of reading it. Sebold does an amazing job of making the book very realistic in it's description of rape, murder, and the aftermath, but still manages to stay whimsical in the words of 14-year old Susie, who is in her heaven. I am not religious and do not believe in heaven, but this possibility seems very probable. I wish that it had ended differently, but that's just the fairy-tale part of me -- in real life, things don't always turn out the way we want, as we are told repeatedly in the book. So true.
B0000542D2|4.0|First of all, why does ... list this movie as \\"A Hard Day's Night ~ John Lennon\\"?  There were three other Beatles, after all, and the Beatles were the trailblazers in not having a \\"lead\\" personality.<br />I was really looking forward to receiving this DVD, primarily because it was advertised prior to release as including \\"The Running, Jumping, & Standing Still Film.\\" This is one of Richard Lester's earlier works, in which I understand you can see a lot of the visual style which became a part of \\"A Hard Day's Night.\\"  So what happened to it?  Miramax has given us a two-disc set with lots and lots of interviews with everybody connected with the movie.  They all tell us what great guys the Beatles were, how talented, etc., but it gets a bit repetitious.  Also, \\"You Can't Do That,\\" the filmed performance that didn't make the final cut of the movie, isn't here.  Nor is the \\"baby carriage\\" interview, or footage of the film's premieres.<br />All in all, a disappointing DVD package of one of the great all-time classics.
0151008116|5.0|This book was incredible - a wonderful character in Pi, a great adventure story on the surface with so many other levels.  A book to go back to and live with long after the last page is read.  A readers dream.
B0000508U6|2.0|I expected more substance from an album with the rave reviews and awards.  Instrumental accompaniment is worth 2 stars and honorable mention but simple sing-song melodies with simplistic lyrics don't hold my attention.  Comparisons to Radiohead are appropriate because I can't figure out what the attraction is with them either.
B000068PQ0|5.0|I had started to wonder whether 2002 would go down as being one of the worst years for music. Sure, there were the Wilco, Bruce Springsteen and Norah Jones albums, but the edge was really missing. I was still looking for something NEW. A friend told me about the Flaming Lips album when it was released, but I was skeptical. After all, their minor hit &quot;vaseline&quot; a few years ago was way up on my list of most annoying songs of all time. My reservations were unwarranted. This album in fantastic from start to finish.
B00005JKDR|4.0|As I have no children of my own, I must admit I love kids movies.  I buy them all the time, possibly I'm trying to recapture my childhood.  Well this movie certainly accomplished that.  It was cute, funny, delightful etc.  With a nice smattering of &quot;grown-up&quot; humor, so parents won't lose their minds after little Billy asks to watch it for the 100th time.  Being a Pixar film the animation was top notch, spectacular really.  Very life like while still maintaining that charm animated films have.  The voice acting was perfect, and very suited to the characters, and by using recognizable voices, it succeeded in humanizing the monsters further.<br />The story, while predictable was well written.  The script flawless.  The bad guys were very bad, but at the same time like any good villian you can sympathize with them.  This is a great movie for children and grown up children like myself.  Buy it.  Rent it. Just see it.
B0000542D2|4.0|First up, the picture looks fantastic. Just like it did back in '64. Black blacks and white whites, the glare of that hot spotlight on Paul during \\"And I Love Her\\" into the cool shadow is transferred beautifully. And the extras, there are tons of them, from Richard Lester on down. View them complete or incorporated into the documentary on the making of the film. However, none of The Beatles partake in any of the supplements of this landmark film. George Martin gives a brief rundown, song by song, of the score.(His remarks on \\"And I Love Her\\" a song I would have thought to be completely up his alley, was a particular surprise.) But his honesty, ultimately, is most welcome. But  not having any of the guys on camera or tape, gives the DVD another level of mythical satus, that in the end works in its favor. They're forever young, like James Dean, and Beatlemania can be revisited without the glare of your own age, or the suriving members, hitting you in the face on the way in or out.Some caveats though. The film is presented in its original aspect ratio, always a plus in my book. However, this is a rare example that works against the film. In the extras, clips from the film are shown full frame and the images are more involving as such. You're able to step inside the movie, immerse yourself and be totally involved. The easy solution would be to have both versions available on the same disc, a very common practice today. But that's not done here. For such a deluxe packaging, it's mystifying. And how about that packaging? Instead of the wonderful poster used in the UK, or the exitement of the one sheet used here in America, there's this bland, boring packaging that you have to look at closely to identify it as having anything to do with A HARD DAY'S NIGHT or The Beatles. There's an interview with the actress who had a scene with Paul on his excursion (each Beatle had one,which pointed out Ringo's lack of one) but it was cut before the film's premiere and sadly does not seem to exist. Only stills remain. Didn't they film \\"You Can't Do That\\" for the concert sequence? Richard Lester talks about cutting a number there, but doesn't say which one. I expected the extras to include \\"I'll Cry Instead\\" but that's not here either. Now to the big one, the sound. A HARD DAY'S NIGHT despite the talent involved, was a low budget quickie (Post production was a few weeks!!!!!) and the sound was always a problem. With the thick Liverpudlian accents and the rapid, and I do mean rapid dialogue (HIS GIRL FRIDAY plays like an Ingmar Bergman film after this) it always took at least three viewings to catch all the dialogue.And while the sound quality of the songs was always of a higher standard than the dialogue soundtrack, somehow the technicians got it good enough so that it blended to a whole. Here however the songs so obviously come from another sound source that you're thrown out of the picture when they start up. Also, even more disturbing, the high frequencies are rolled off, leaving the songs, with a bigger bottom end than  top. To somebody's ears I guess this sounded good. Cleaner, more polished, perhaps. But I've never heard these songs sound like this, not even when I'd fool around with my equalizer while listening to the soundtrack. It takes away from the excitement of the score. I had expected something different from the sound, something on the order of the YELLOW SUBMARINE remix actually. But not this! While my memory of the film may not be exact, I know you didn't hear the complete fade out of the title song in the opening credits, I thought I remembered a bit of it being played as it blended with screams of the railway station girls,while the producing and directing credits are shown. Here the song ends abruptly as soon as John stops singing. It jarred me as being not correct, so I was on the \\"lookout\\" for any sound deviations after that. I'm all for cleaning up old soundtracks, some of these films can become pretty noisy in their old age,but you can go too far and wind up shaving off the \\"sound of the room\\" as is constantly being done with older films by people who are being paid to know better. This isn't really a problem here, but I'd rather have a small amount of \\"noise\\" on the soundtrack as opposed to that \\"dead quiet\\" soundtrack that removes frequencies from the film track so that it's aurally as quiet as films being made today. I'm \\"only\\" a consumer and I'm not supposed to know better. But I do. Five-star movie. Four-star DVD.but you can go too far and wind up shaving off the \\"sound of the room\\" as is constantly being done with older films by people who are being paid to know better.

B00005NTN5|4.0|\\"Bound\\" surprises the viewer from start to finish with plot twist upon turn - it's a great movie. It'll grab your attention right from the start with two passionate scenes between Jennifer Tilly & Gina Gershon, and then things really get rolling. <br />Joey Pants (as folks seem to call him in the biz) plays a middle-managment gangster who borders on the pathetic; his attitude is definitely much bigger than he is. After a collection operation gone a bit awry, Violet (Tilly) and Corky (Gershon) hatch a plan to make off with more than two million dollars of the mafia's money. The plan is simple enough, but naturally is doesn't go off exactly as planned; blood is shed, there's a lot of running around and screaming, cover-up is laid upon cover-up, and some pruning shears come into play more than once. <br />This is great film noir, and everyone is cast perfectly. The brothers do an excellent job of direction, with novel angles and shooting methods (you wouldn't expect anything less from these guys, would you?) They also employ some classic film noir sequences that work perfectly. It should hold your attention throughout, very enjoyably.
B00000GUZP|5.0|Nobody less than Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards (Chic) produced this solo album for Debbie Harry (Blondie leadsinger).Kookoo is full of Urban Funk Rock. Every track is very well done. Originally recorded in 1981, but now and here in the 21st century it has grown to a masterpiece for me !! The album sounds like if it's recorded very recently. <br />\\"Inner city Spillover\\",the beautiful Jazz ballad \\"Now I know, you know\\", \\"The Jam was moving\\", the masterpiece \\"Chrome\\",\\"Military Rap\\" and \\"Under arrest\\" are real stand outs. \\"Oasis\\" is a delicious dance song.<br />If you think the Chic productions are 80's music, well not this one !! Debbie's Kookoo dethtrones Diana Ross's \\"Up Side Down\\" almost 25 years later!!!
B00006AW2O|5.0|I bought this album brand new,in mono,  in 1964 when I was 12. Like another reviewer, Russell Scott, I played it until the grooves wore out. I used to lay in the dark, on the floor of my bedroom, with my ear against the speaker of my father's portable Emerson, and I memorized every lick, every pause and every breath of this amazing and astounding album. Over the years, I've purchased several replacements, including the phoney-baloney &quot;stereo&quot; vinyl and one CD. Now, all these years later it appears on the market as an SACD (whatever THAT is - or hopes to be) and asks me to buy it AGAIN.<br />Well, I'm happy to report that I have and that it was WORTH EVERY PENNY! Somebody finally found the work tapes and mixed REAL STEREO to 6 of the tracks - and what a revelation they are! Around and Around, Confessin' the Blues (which features, IMO, the best vocal of Jagger's career), the exquisite and sublime, but annoying MESS of Empty Heart, It's All Over Now, 2120 South Michigan (with an extended surprise), and If You Need Me are presented the way they SHOULD have been 38 years ago.<br />Only (the single version of) Time Is On My Side, Good Times,Bad Times, Under The Boardwalk, Congratulations (which has always been a favorite of more people I've known than I can count, and is still spelled wrong on the cover), Grown Up Wrong and Suzie Q are in mono.<br />I can't help but wonder why, if these tracks are available in stereo NOW,  weren't they originally? Why was London Records compelled to LIE about it with their &quot;Electronically Rechannelled&quot; garbage?<br />I suppose I should count my blessings and be happy with 6 out of 12, but I can't help being suspicious that in another 38 years the others will surface &quot;after an exhaustive search&quot;, of course, and I'll be too DEAD to care.<br />Only a big handful of British Invasion albums really MATTERED to me and &quot;12X5&quot; has always been, and will ever be, NUMBER ONE. <BR>I offer a 'thank you', in smallcase, to those who were responsible for this release. Better late than never, I guess.
B00005OM4Q|5.0|This DVD has left my utterly speechless. It is so good, the extra's so in-line with the movie, the menues so fitting, and the commentary so entertaining that I can't say enough good things about it. But let's start with the movie itself.<br />There are two version of the movie included here. The original &quot;theatrical&quot; release, which is roughly 2 hours, and the &quot;bootlegged&quot; extended release, shown here for the first time. This version of the movie adds 40 minutes worth of scenes. Both versions are excellent, but since the &quot;bootlegged&quot; release (or &quot;untitled&quot;, as it's called) is simply more of what made the original so good, the same comments can more or less be applied to both. Note that the &quot;Untitled&quot; version is ultimately far superior, but if you haven't seen either you will be just as well off (if not better off, for that matter) watching the shorter version first.<br />It would be easy to describe Almost Famous as a time-piece, &quot;a movie about Rock and Roll&quot;. And while it certainly is that (a movie about Rock and Roll), the connotations that come with such a description would limit the emotional power of this film drastically. It is just as easily a movie about family, a movie about love, a movie about money, and a movie about music in general. What ties this all together is, for lack of a better word, &quot;magic&quot;. Sure, I could go in and analyze what makes this &quot;magic&quot;: the cinematography (by mastermind John Toll) that makes a movie about Rock and Roll seem like a historical epic. The aching music, compiled (and at times even scored) by director Cameron Crowe and his wife. The innocent yet extremely subtle acting. Sets and costumes that are so good you quickly forget you are watching a movie. This &quot;magic&quot; is demonstrated in any number of emotional scenes; it is what ties the movie together, holds it on-course, helps it maintain it's vision. <br />In one of the best composed scenesin the movie, the band has just talked to a new manager who wants them to hire him. He represents everything that was going wrong with Rock &amp; Roll in the early 70's (and indeed still today): bands loosing touch with thier fans/roots, sacrificing art for money, popularity over content. After he leaves, there is an uncomfortable silence. Finally the drummer says, &quot;I miss him already&quot;. The scene cuts to Penny Lane, our main &quot;groupie&quot; in the tale, dancing over the stadium of what was but a night before a concert all. In the background we hear Cat Stevens achingly singing &quot;The Wind&quot;. The magic and energy of the concert that is now gone, part of the past, can still be felt in the air. Penny literally dances with it. The contrast between the band selling out and Penny, thier biggest fan, basking in the bliss of what makes music so powerful, is moving beyond words. Even if you have never had any interest in rock (or music, for that matter), you will still be appreciate how real some of these scenes are. Cameron Crowes eye for detail is at times frightning.<br />The extras on the DVD are really nice, and since half the fun is discovering them yourself I'll leave that to you. The commentary is worth noting, however. It is between Cameron and his mother, Alice. It is easily the warmest Commentary I have ever heard. <br />In short, this is highly worth the price. In my opinion really a standard for how DVD's aught to be made.
B00005QG9J|5.0|Incubus' Morning View is by far, my favorite cd...besides being my fave band. I never get tired of listening to it. My fave song on the cd is Warning ; usually, i have to listen to a song at least 3 times to know if i like it; but with Warning, was different, I fell in love with the song the first time I heard it. Other songs I recommend from the cd are: Circles, 11 AM and Nice to know you. Every song is good. A lot of feeling in all of the songs....songs about love and about hate...also about lessons.  I highly recommend Morning View.
B00003CX95|5.0|Braveheart is a tremendous movie. It has been compared to \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\", and rightly so: In terms of visual scale it is incredible both in scope and detail. Also like \\"Lawrence\\" it doesn't let go of the viewer until the very end. While perhaps the acting isn't as tight and well-tuned as it is in the older epic, that works to it's advantage. Some of the scenes in Braveheart are so masterfully composed that they exceed, in my opinion, anything Lean managed to bring across. Of course it works both ways, and while Braveheart is perhaps more passionate then \\"Lawrence\\" it certainly isn't nearly as subtle. But I'd argue that it equals it, on certain levels.<br />Braveheart isn't about historical accuracy. It's about myth. Think about the film-makers being story-tellers, sitting around a fire, telling you a tale. You can believe as much (or as little) of it as you like. The strength of the tale remains regardless. As such think of Braveheart as being a piece of Scottish myth. William Wallace, the tales main charachter, isn't a leader to be historicaly scrutinized and critiqued. He's a heroe to be cherished. The power and versatility of myth is such that we can cherish entities regardless of thier authenticity, or for that matter existence. One need look no further then the Bible for proof. Myth is something that is very much a part of the human condition, and yet so much of it is lacking in the Western world that when it comes along it is a shocking reminder of how good it can be. Both the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy by J.R.R Tolkien and \\"Star Wars\\" by George Lucas are perfect examples of how hungry the West is for Myth. While many critics make the false assumption that Braveheart is a \\"historical drama\\", it is merely continuing this tradtion of ancient story-telling.<br />Much credit must be given to Cinematographer John Toll for the general look of the film. Scenes are shot with an epic thrust. Toll puts us in the midst of this epic conflict, while at the same timekeeping things in perspective. Some of the shots in this movie resemble Renaissance paintings in thier composition, so well crafted is the camera-work. The music is equally important. From the wailing of bagpipes over rumbling war-drums, to the sad theme of love lost, the musical themes in Braveheart are both Scottish in style and yet something more. Much like the theme from \\"Lawrence\\" they embody so much. Music fulfilling it's role to the fullest.<br />The result of all the different elements that went into this movie is something that trancends words. The most I can say is that this movie embodies so much of the ancient Celtic myth and lengend that we hear whispers of everywhere we go. It throws us into a world that is different and yet eerily familiar. <br />The DVD package is certainly good, it's just not excellent. For a movie this epic, especially considering that it won an Academy Award for Best picture (which tends to warrant fleshed out DVD packages), I'm surprised it didn't get a better treatment. The visual and audio quality is decent, but certainly not exceptional, which it really aught to be. The extras emphasize quality over quantity. The short documentary is informing, but it is obvious that it is only scratching the surface of a much bigger picture. The commentary track IS very good, but it slightly minimalistic in it's approach. It often seems as if Gibson is as engrossed in the movie was we are, and stops for a few minutes at a time to watch the movie without much comment. This is nice, but I would have liked a more active commentary with John Toll in the mix talking about the more technical aspects. While I can gaurantee that a beefed up version will eventually hit the scene, you probably have a good few years to wait until that day. Until then this DVD is excellent, if for nothing else then the movie itself.
B000068TPN|1.0|We Were Soldiers is nothing more than a post-9-11 feel good movie with a predictable theme casting America as the international good guy fighting for peace and freedom.  It portrays the battle of the Ia Drang as a stunning American victory when in fact the battle highlights serious deficiencies in our tactics that ultimately led to our defeat in Vietnam.  You won't see scenes of soldiers burning down villages with Zippos and clearing free-fire zones, or of helicopter gunships firing indiscriminately into the jungle.  This film conveniently ignores all the controversy, turmoil, and painful images that spring to mind at the mere mention of Vietnam.<br />The actual filmmaking is as laudable as its content.  The setting is supposed to be in Vietnam, but the film editors failed to crop out the many oak trees dotting the background.  The characters -- all of whom manage to remain relatively clean and dry in what should be sweltering equatorial heat -- are nothing more than a series of stereotypes along the lines of an old John Wayne movie.  In one scene a soldier tells Mel Gibson that he spent time in the Peace Corps building homes for orphans in Africa and that he hopes he won't make any new orphans in Vietnam.  The two then kneel and pray together.<br />While the movie is worth renting to see how silly the dialogue and acting is, don't expect a war movie that portrays men in a desperate fight for survival among chaos and destruction.  Instead see Blackhawk Down, Saving Private Ryan, Platoon, or Apocalypse Now.  On the other hand, if you're looking for a movie to justify America acting on behalf of colonial ideals to maintain our hegemony over the Third World, We Were Soldiers at least makes the attempt.

0140544518|5.0|I'm STILL chuckling after buying this book and reading it before gifting it to my nephew Greg, 11, and Kayla, 7. And,. as with other books by Jon Scieszka, the huge problem is: I want this book for MYSELF.<br /><br />The bottom line is that in his version, wonderfully illstrated by Lane Smith, the Three Little Pigs is the ultimate story of SPIN CONTROL. This time, unlike in a zillion other versions, the wolf is telling HIS side of the story -- what REALLY happened. And to hear him tell his story (with all of the familiar elements and a delicious economy of words) it's all a terrible mistunderstanding about his allergy, his desire not to waste food, and distortions by the press.<br />None of this gives any of this away, since the genius of this is not only in the conception, but in the TELLING of the story. Don't consider this just a book for kids. You can EASILY gift it to friends, relatives, favorite (and unfavorite) politicians and members of the media. It's the perfect late 20th-early-21st century retelling of the story, with the wolf as the poor misunderstood victim (of the police, the media, and his health  etc). Just like the old Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoons, this works on two levels so the adults will be as delighted as the kids by this story -- which could easily have run as one of Mad Magazine's better pieces.<br />Get it for the kids, read it for yourself...and get ready to realize what a great gift this would be for adults of any political persuasions. LOVED IT so much...I hate to give this to the kids! Kids of ALL ages will love this story, whether you read it to them or they read it themselves (so will the kids under 40 years old).
B00006J3WH|5.0|This CD is truly inspired.  Granted, I love all things Buffy - except maybe for Riley - and most things Angel - save Cordelia - but &quot;Once More, With Feeling&quot; is truly a brilliant episode, and the soundtrack is no different.  Especially when one takes into consideration that it was not written by a musician, nor performed by singers.  These &quot;amateurs&quot; are incredibly professional.  Amber and Giles (Amber Benson and Anthony Stewart Head) are truly talented, as is Spike (James Marsters).  Sarah Michelle Gellar does surprisingly well, and deserves praise for simply electing to DO it, rather than having it dubbed.  All in all, I am very happy with the finished product.
B00006IU73|5.0|Aural landscapes of imaginary places abound on this brilliant soundscape.  Steve Wilson has reached a pinnacle on this, the bands first major studio recording.  \\"Blackest Eyes\\" opens and it is very strong.  Great intro,powerful harmonies, searing guitars.  Its got it all.  The songs move seemlesly, with alternate heavy and accoustic turns.  This is the dream stuff of Fripp, Floyd, Manzanera, Bolin incarnate, fully realized and dramatically performed. \\"In Abstenia\\" harkens back to the early days of metal and progressive, when the whole package took your mind to faraway places.  Many, many highlights:  \\"The Sound of Muzak\\", \\"Heartattack in a Lay By\\" and the outstanding \\"Gravity Eyelids\\". One play and \\"In Abstenia\\" will remain in your player for a long time. As creator, Mr. Wilson has indeed created a mastertape.
0316666343|4.0|If you are thinking of getting this book, please do! Its very moving and fun to read. It brings up all kinds of emotions, but greatest of all, it confuses you. How can Susie not be terribly sad? How can she sit and watch her killer get away! Not oh so satisfying in the happy ending department...what you want to happen most doesn't. But very good anyways.
B00006J3WH|5.0|Usually when a t.v. show tries to do a musical episode I cringe, and I have to admit when I first heard Buffy was going to do one I had my reservations.  Joss has pulled off a lot of things in the Buffyverse before but I wasn't sure if he could carry this off.  Boy was I wrong.  Once More With Feeling ended up being one of the best Buffy episodes ever.  I was so impressed with the cast.  Everything was perfectly executed.  This album is a must for every Buffy fan and even if you don't watch the show you'll still be able to enjoy a very well made cd full of great songs, with standouts being Under Your Spell, Rest in Peace, Walk Through the Fire, Something to Sing About, and Where Do We Go From Here.
B000002OAZ|5.0|When you take Howlin' Wolf-one of the greatest Chicago bluesmen ever-and put him together with Eric Clapton, Bill Wyman, Charlie Watts and Steve Winwood, what do you get? You get one exciting blues album. I read somewhere that blues purists don't like this album, but I know from listening to it that this is pure, electric, energetic, rockin' blues.<br /> The album starts off strong; the first thing you hear is Clapton's beautiful slide guitar riff on &quot;Rockin' Daddy.&quot; On this track, we have Phil Upchurch on bass, Winwood on piano, The Wolf's long time lead guitarist Hubert Sumlin on rhythm guitar, Charlie Watts on drums, and The Wolf himself singing the vocals in his famous growling stlyle. We hear a wonderful solo from Clapton, who plays off the melody of the tune beautifully. <br /> Ringo plays drums on &quot;I Ain't Superstitious&quot; and the results are awesome. With a horn section (Joe Miller, Jordan Sandke, Dennis Lansing) holding the roots of the chords, and Clapton playing a slide riff to back The Wolf's vocals, we get a truly great jam.<br />  The rest of the album is as exciting has the first two songs. We hear Jeffrey M. Carp's soulful harp on &quot;Sittin' On Top Of The World,&quot; and The Wolf's vocals are just as astounding. Clapton adds another creative solo, again playing off the beautiful melody of the song. Later in the album, we hear the amusing Willie Dixon tune &quot;Built For Comfort&quot; in which the horn section mentioned before adds its unique touch. &quot;Highway 49&quot; is one of the highlights of the album, with classic guitar riffs and The Wolf's soulful, bluesy singing. You get the feeling that no one could sing this song like The Wolf. Basically, when buying blues, you can't go wrong with Howlin' Wolf. Overall, this album is excellent. It is a beautiful display of classic blues performed by an all-star cast.
B00005KFUM|5.0|I've had it. NO MORE RADIOHEAD COMPARISONS. Just because a band is British doesn't mean they &quot;sound a bit like Radiohead.&quot; Muse have infinitely more energy and talent than any whining Thom Yorke. New Born is one of the most earth shattering things ever produced, and Feeling Good is jazzy subtelty mixed with perfect Muse near-headache-rock. This album is a huge burst of energy to British music, and I would like to say that I like pretty much every British band... except Radiohead. So let's just say that Muse are better, great, fab and this album proves it.
B000069HK2|5.0|This band blends hardcore with little touches of punk and some emo and they sound real good doing it too. &quot;A Box Full Of Sharp Objects&quot; is such an awesome song. It appeals to lovers of hardcore, punk, and metal. Everyone should download it now! All their other songs are good too. Their poppy one &quot;The Taste Of Ink&quot; had to grow on me a little but now I like it alot as well. Make sure not to miss this if you like Thrice, AFI, From Autumn To Ashes, or Poison The Well. This is a great new band that hopefully commercialism won't ruin.
B000062XM3|5.0|First glance... surely it's a dumb Brad Pitt movie, lots of action, lots of Brad... surely.<BR>   No. Once I was convinced to watch it, I was pleased to see Edward Norton was involved. I remember watching Primal Fear and hating it, but Edward Norton's performance was awe-inspiring. Here he is doing it again.<BR>   I'll break the film down. The visuals. A good to look at film, with tons of speedy direction from David Fincher (the guy who brought us Seven... for which we should be very thankful) with lots of cutting and some hefty decent special effects. The story. A work of genius, what begins as a simple little action thing develops into themes of terrorism, hatred of society and ultimately insanity. It really is a smart film, with tons of decent dialogue and a truly knock-you-off-your-feet ending, which you will have the hardest time guessing. <BR>   But the best thing about the film is the two lead performances. Edwards Norton's paranoid, exhausted narration is fantastic to listen to, and it's wonderful to have a film centre around such a neurotic guy. Brad Pitt is fabulous as Tyler, literally a personification of rebellion and freedom.<BR>   It's a work of genius, a visual treat, and a mind-bender if you're not paying attention... so do yourself a favour and listen to what's going on. It'll be worth it.
B000002MX7|5.0|A talent of the stature of Miss Khan should not be dishonored in this fashion! One of the century's most distinctive soulful voices is represented in this compilation of tunes, ranging from her \\"Rufus\\" days to her remarkable solo career. A \\"greatest hits\\" collection such as this one deserves a price twice this much.<br />But, at this bargain price, this disc should be \\"flying off the shelves\\".<br />I will never understand the American music-buying public.<br />EMINEM sells more????<br />Where are our ears???
B00001MXXH|5.0|Ferris Bueller's Day Off is one of my favorite movies of all time.  I think that Matthew Broderick is a very talented actor, and is very funny in this movie.  I also think that Alan Ruck and Mia Sara are perfect for their role.  Ferris Bueller's Day Off is a movie that you can watch over and over and still laugh out loud.
B00005LB50|2.0|See, the thing about demos &amp; outtakes is they are rough drafts or works in progress which make nice filler or bonus material. That said, buy the 3 individual CDs. They've been nicely remastered &amp; reasonably priced. The 1st album even has the mono version of the album included(preferred by the band members) along with the stereo format. If this had contained all 3 albums in their entirety plus the extended version of &quot;Bluebird&quot;, this could've been a 5 star comp. Then, a third or 4th disc could've been tacked on to please the diehards.
B000002KBH|5.0|I first heard this as an LP as a child from my parent's music collection.<br />I now own this CD as an adult and still never tire of it.  Whenever I'm a little tense from work or just from this planet's complications in general, I play American Beauty, sing with it, and....well, I'm just fine!<br />Who needs counselors or priests when you have this great album?
B00005OAA6|4.0|Welll Welllll Wellllllllll!  After reading all of your reviews, I decided to buy this album.  I am very glad I did... I got it last week, and I haven't stopped playing the CD yet!  The album starts off with a nice hit, entitled \\"Not Such An Innocent Girl\\", which you would never imagine even a Spice Girl singing...  It reminds me of Jennifer Lopez's \\"If You Had My Love\\"... Which are two great songs.  My favorite track would have to be \\"Midnight Fantasy\\"...  it is a fast-pace sord of romance song.  Like Melanie B's \\"Hot\\", this is a great CD you should pick up.  If you looked at Victoria in the Spice Girls before, and you saw absolutely nothing in this, this will absolutely blow your mind, and have you saying \\"WOW!\\" over and over again.  Buy this CD... It's awesome and you will not be dissapointed!!!
B000002KBH|5.0|I first heard this as an LP as a child from my parent's music collection.<br />I now own this CD as an adult and still never tire of it.  Whenever I'm a little tense from work or just from this planet's complications in general, I play American Beauty, sing with it, and....well, I'm just fine!<br />Who needs counselors or priests when you have this great album?
B00005JKLZ|1.0|...to get my wasted time back from watching this film!  What a huge disappointment.  Normally, I'm quite laid back with my reviews, but having seen the original version of this film with Rod Taylor, I was uneasily awaiting the release of this version.  Bypassing the fact that Guy Pearce nowhere near fits the lead role, I also found the history and fleshing out of the plot to be greatly lacking.  Had I not seen the original, I'd have been lost for the lack of plot.  In addition to a poor plot, there are many logical holes in the story that are ridiculously overlooked, as if the audience is too dumb to catch on.  The DVD itself is pretty poorly set up.  The bonus features only include ONE deleted scene, barely-there special-effects featurettes, and NO behind-the-scenes specials.  Too bad this movie is such a flop--I was looking forward to owning it, but definitely will not add it to my collection now.
B00006IUL7|3.0|This film is a good showcase for the director of \\"Momento,\\" but that doesn't hide the fact that this is another Hollywood retelling of a superior foreign film. I wish I was being cynical, but the faults of this picture are too obvious. This shouldn't have been a star vehicle. Yes, Robin Williams is effective, but you still watch this thinking \\"Wow, this is Robin Willaims.\\" Second, the moral ambiguity and psychological complexity of the original is gone or smoothed over. You know in this one who is good and who is evil, and there is poetic justice for all. I didn't really care to see 1997's haunting thriller become another suspense movie which doesn't give its audience enough credit. I will say that I did enjoy it overall, and will probably purchase this disc. It can sit right next to my copy of the original \\"Insomnia.\\" But while this one is just good, the original is great. Watch and compare.
0790749815|5.0|There's nothing like seeing that movie for the first time.You'll probably wonder about the story,but you'll be entertained and certainly won't be bored.No other HITCHCOCK movie can match this one in terms of sheer entertainment.Suspense,comedy relief and unexpected things happening from real one to the end.I still remember the thrill of watching it for the very first time at the CONCORDIA UNIVERSITY's repertory theater.HITCHCOCK's direction,LEHMAN's script and HERRMANN's music blend perfectly.Among my favorite scenes:MASON slapping LANDAU because he missed his assignment;MARIE SAINT's quiet beauty in her love scenes with GRANT;the classic cropdusting sequence;the anxiety of watching GRANT getting away from the mansion etc.This is ALFRED HITCHCOCK'S greatest movie of all time.

B000068CNX|5.0|I loved the Second Season Of Friends. To me it was the season that you have to own. Everyday, I have to watch the whole season because I am just so obsessed with this show! If there was one thing to say to the cutomers, I would say,\\"BUY IT!\\"
B000069HK2|5.0|I heard &quot;A Box Full of Sharp Objects&quot; on the radio and went and bought the album 20 minutes later--it's been a long time since a single song made me do that, probably some Superdrag or Get Up Kids album.  This album doesn't really sound like emo-core to me...  More like hardcore with a few old-school Jimmy Eat World moments.  Actually, maybe that's what emo-core is supposed to sound like.  At any rate, this album rocks and the band should be pretty damn proud that their debut is this good.  Definitely a new fan.

0790729725|2.0|NOTE:  THE TWO STARS IS FOR THE DVD, NOT THE MOVIE.  THE MOVIE DESERVES 5 STARS.<br />Yes, this review doesn't really concern the movie.  Just know that \\"Goodfellas\\" is one of my favorite Mafia movies.  Everything about the movie is superb, and it deserves 5 stars all the way.  So please, DO NOT THINK THAT THIS REVIEW IS ATTACKING THE MOVIE, because it's not.<br />What this review IS attacking is this terrible DVD.  I didn't know I was buying a smaller version of a laserdisk.  Why does the movie have to be on two sides???  I don't get it.  Yeah, it might be a long movie, but they were able to fit \\"Casino\\" all on one side.  So what's up with that?<br />There better be a special or collector's edition coming out soon, because this movie needs one bad.  Not just because it's a classic and a masterpiece, but because it needs to be on ONE side!  When I buy a DVD, I expect just that.<br />Other than the movie being on both sides, the DVD really lacks in special features, the picture quality is so-so, and the sound could've been improved in some parts.<br />Again, \\"Goodfellas\\" is a masterpiece in my mind, and it deserves 5 stars.  But the DVD is just awful.  In fact, calling the DVD \\"awful\\" is being too polite.<br />Warner Bros.:  Come out with a special edition, for crying out-loud!!!<br />If you love this movie, don't get the DVD.  Just get it on VHS and wait until a better version comes out.  TRUST ME on this one.  Unless they have updated the movie and placed it all on one side.  If that's the case, please let me know and I will have to re-buy it.<br />I will write a real review for the movie in the VHS section sometime soon.<br />Again, the low rating is for the DVD; NOT the film.
B000002J1B|5.0|Being a huge fan of Yes, and loving the Yes Album, Close to the Edge, Fragile and others, Relayer is one that for some reason took me a while to warm to, I liked it but over the years, I absolutely love this album of only 3 songs.  This has to be Yes at their most jazziest and almost some fusion.  Patrick Moraz definately influenced this album.  The title track sounds for a moment like something from the Tales album, then something explodes and captures every bit of your attention.  Gates starts off with a very catchy quiet intro and vocal part and takes you into an intense battle like theme with Keys and guitars exploding all over the place. This is the hardest Yes has sounded. The end part of Gates is titled Soon and is such a beautiful ending to a classic Yes masterpiece.  Sound Chaser has is a frenzy of delight with Steve Howe's guitar and keys again going wild, this is a definate showcase for Steve Howe's guitar madness.  Chris Squire puts in great bass parts and Jon is at his best.    Once you have absorbed the first two tunes, To Be Over ends  with the most beautiful song I feel of Yes's entire output.  To be Over feautures very melodic keys from Patrick Moraz and great guitar and one of he best vocal performances ever for Jon.  If you are not moved to tears by this song, nothing will move you.  If you passed this one by or thought you did not enjoy it as much as the other Yes albums years ago, try again, you will be stunned and lost for words.
0446678430|4.0|Rich Dad Series<BR>Retire Young, Retire Rich by Robert Kiyosaki<br />This book is more updated for this economy and has some interesting points in it.  The main thing is to change your concept of what is possible.  I have heard this saying many times, if you believe it is possible, then it will be possible for you.  Next, he suggests that we get as much knowledge in the real estate rental business as possible.  Take courses, read, and look at hundreds of houses.  I would also suggest calling people who are advertising their homes in the paper, and ask them what response they are getting.  I firmly believe that having some money in real estate is great.  I don't think it is as passive as he says it is, but if you get great tenants, then it will be a lot better on your life.  I know from my experience I was paying my landlords mortgage on both houses with my rent.  He had almost no expenses on my part.  I don't think real estate market will zoom up in the Bay Area in the next few years, in fact, I think it will go down.  But, I do believe over the long run, this area will pick up.  Robert says to make sure the house is cashflow positive as soon as you buy it.  Don't hope for apprieciation to make it profitable.  I like that idea.  Also, he says, it is much better to buy in a down market than an up market.  During the up market, learn the market well enough so that you can spot bargains.  He did not say much about buying foreclosures.  I guess if you have a good enough real estate agent, then he or she will be able to find some good deals for you.   <br />He talked about investments.  I did not agree with him on options - they are risky and most people lose on them.  If you really know what you are doing you can make money, but very few do.  <br />I did like that he says you should ask yourself what lifestyle do you want to live when you retire.  I feel that I would love to have $500k annual income when I retire.  That will let me live the lifestyle I desire to live.<br />I highly agree that I need to have friends that have a bigger dream in their life.  I need to hang around people that are going to make it in life, not ones that want to barely hang on.  I have met very few in my age group who really have that attitude, and he says that these people are harder to find, but keep searching.  <br />The main idea I got out of this book is that it is possible for anyone to become financial independent if they really make it a goal and work intelligently towards it.  I feel the real estate market will take a dive in the next year or so in the Bay Area, and I will be prepared to get some bargains and make some money.<br />Beware of the sales stuff in this book.  He is trying to sell his other books which I think are great.
B000051VWW|2.0|Sade has been out of the loop for 8 years...and it shows on this CD.The only song that got my attention was &quot;Immigrant&quot;.<BR>&quot;Lover's rock&quot; was unmoving and whiny.The whole cd sounded bland,<BR>uncaptivating,depressing, and uninspired...like it was rushed to be put out there for the fans to feast on.Yuck! What a dissapointment!and a waste of money.&quot;Stronger than pride&quot; was my best Sade album by far,This one doesn't even measure up!
B00005JK99|5.0|I've seen the reviews of this from other people, and although all positive, they don't seem to get it, maybe their percept-o-meter is broken.  This movie hilariously lampoons one of those legendary stories that all countries have and most people believe to be true.  They show the rediculous nature of royalty, and I certainly never perceived the peasants he encountered as communists. (Nor do they make themselves out to be that way).  Here are these people, working their land, and all of a sudden the \\"King\\" comes along.  They want to know who made him King?  Why, the lady of the lake, of course.  They're supposed to believe he has some devine power given to him by some aquatic tart?  That scene is clearly about how people will get along fine if just left alone, we don't need any self or otherwise appointed regents to come along and save us from ourselves.  I seriously doubt the human race survived over a million years without such dictators by accident.  The movie shows the lengths that people will go to get people to believe things that simply aren't true.  Hence, the scene about the \\"witch\\".  I love the holy hand grenade scene, where the priest figure reads of a sacred book with bible-like prose with instructions on how to detonate the holy hand grenade.  Is this not a perfect metaphor for how religious zealoutry often breeds violence and, look at Palestine, explosions?  Keep your percept-o-meter on high with this movie, because it's not just hilarious, it's perfect dogmatic satire.  It's sort of an illustration of what stories and legends would have us believe, if only we were so stupid to fall for it.  The cast of Monty Python were comic geniuses.

B0000028RR|5.0|The music is great, and adds a wonderful BACKGROUND for the real purpose behind Zack De La Rocha's vision.  I will never, as long as I live, forget the first time I saw my friend's RATM video.  Something woke up in the back of my head that had been lulled to sleep by mainstream media and government training camps(schools).  I think \\"Bullet In The Head\\" is my favorite track because it allowed me to see propaganda for what it is.  Now we fly American flags made by political slaves in communist China..is life to f-in weird or what?  The things that are said on this album will make the righteous man wake from his slumber and seek the truth, as I've been doing ever since that night I was introduced to Rage.  The ironic thing is that my friend likes Rage because of their sound, as so many here appear to.  That sound, though great, has nothing to do with it.  The music is a vehicle for Zack to wake you up, the shake the structure up.  If it wasn't for Rage, I'd be like most people, going to a job I hate, not understanding AT ALL how this government works, and acting like Christopher Columbus discovered an uninhabited land here.  They [took] the land, the government is indeed corrupt, and my fear in saying so has been removed by knowing it's my duty as a human being to reject evil in all it's forms.  So, embrace the truth, buy this CD, get some good books not written as disinformation, and FREE YOUR MIND.
B000067CPX|3.0|If you are looking for the power or speed of TRHC, you're going to be disappointed. If you're looking for a more mature and creative product then this one is for you. Personally, while I can respect this as a creative work, it's not what I expect to hear when I listen to the Red Hot Chili Peppers. <br />I remember several critics complaining about One Hot Minute back in 1995, about how that album was not what they expected and how it somehow lacked the same style that propelled the band to fame. While I defended One Hot Minute, I can't defend By the Way; this album sounds too much like a collection of B-side songs. There is a certain \\"sound\\" that this bad has come to be known for and this album fails to deliver it outside of the title song \\"By the Way\\". In fact if you are expecting more songs of that nature, you're going to be sadly disappointed. <br />Maybe the boys in the bad are slowing down with age or want to show a more creative and mature side of their music. What they are achieving is alienation of their fan base with this album.
B000063S6Z|5.0|After September 11 i had been expecting a new wave of artistic growth from artists but nearly a year later i have witnessed none of it except possibly on television commercials but i do believe Moby has hit the nail on the head here with 18.From the first track which completely caught me by suprise and echoed a calling to a new generation, a masterpiece for a new generation now lets hope other artists follow suit. This may be the best post Sept. 11 Album i have heard.It echoes all the things i used to love about POP music that have died.
B00006J3WH|5.0|I've always loved this show and this episode has 2 be the best ever! I have a question though. Are they going to bring it out in the box sets or by itself?
B00006F7S4|1.0|I bought this CD without the benefit of hearing it first on a listening station.  The last CD I purchased by Beck was Odelay. I had read two great reviews of Sea Change in usually reputable magazines, and, since I liked Odelay, assumed I would also like this.  Either my taste in music has changed or this CD is just downright boring.  I've listened to it three times now and can't see where all those great reviews are coming from. Are musicians so lacking in innovation these days that Rolling Stone would rave about something this lightweight?
0316666343|4.0|This was a very thought-provoking book. At first glance the book seems to be about her murder and the man who killed her and how she was killed, but then it grows into something different. It is more about how her family comes to term with her death over the passage of weeks and months and years. It's about new beginnings and saying goodbye.<BR> I quite liked this book. I think it gives the reader a lot of things to think about. Whether or not your idea of what heaven is like concurs with the author (mine doesn't), telling the story from the point of view of someone who has died is quite interesting.
B000001ESJ|5.0|Just before the bulging excesses of 'Hemispheres', and having just shrugged off the anchor of traditional hard rock on '2112', \\"A Farewell to Kings\\" is Rush's most explosive, beautiful, heartfelt and dramatic album.  Its as close to the nature and power of the band Rush as one can get out of any of their albums. <br />Beginning with the title track, three things are jarringly apparent:  (1) Alex Lifeson has bloomed into a true virtuoso guitar player, (2) lyrically the band matured to the point where imagery and allegory seamlessly join with appropriate musical backdrops, and (3) Neil Peart's drums become \\"instruments\\" rather than mere things to pound on.<br />The second song, Xanadu, recalls the story by Samuel T. Coleridge and his hallucinations on Kubla Khan's pleasure dome.  Rush pays close attention to the small details such as the ending riff with the xylophone, and the sounds of nature at the top of the song.  Like the rest of the album, this song should be listened to on all levels to glimpse how each arrangement works in perfect balance with the others.<br />Closer to the Heart is a classic by any definition.  Its a Rush benchmark in songwriting and proved to the doubters that Rush obviously could write neatly packaged songs, they simply chose not to most of the time.<br />Cinderella Man is an underrated song and perhaps, one of their finest.  The bridge section (much like the one in the title track) is a patented Rush song-within-a-song, and shows nice bass work by Geddy.  Lyrically and musically, this is challenging song for the listener and rewards on many levels.<br />Madrigal is a clean, simple ballad again displaying Rush's ability to be effective on any level.  The fretless bass line carries the song over almost indetectable drums and a shimmering guitar.  <br />Cygnus X-1, simply put, is the most powerful of any Rush song, ever.  Its downright frightening, and conveys the terror of space exploration.  Taking an appropriate page from Don Quixote, thespaceship \\"Rocinante\\" sets out with high hopes and the music is raw, energetic and suddenly met with dread.  The resulting spiral of the music crescendos along with absolutely savage drumwork and vocals.  <br />This albums proves that Rush was, for a moment, the most terrifying, talented, subtle and sublime bands to decend on the barren late-70s musical landscape.  Its no wonder during that time they were met with some resistance.  Like throwing a computer to a bunch of cavemen, people just weren't ready.
B00000K19E|5.0|Sure, I'd heard of it when it came out; with all the hype surrounding that movie, you'd have to have been somewhere near the South Pole not to have heard of it.  And there were many comments at the time about how fresh and new and inspirational the movie was - but having then seen a few sequences which consisted of nothing more than some seemingly pointless kung-fu stuff mixed with cool special effects, I decided this movie was not for me.  Shame...  Then I realized that it was playing on television last night, so I decided to sit down and watch it, on the fervent recommendation of a friend of mine.  <br />Wow.  That's all I could think of when the end credits were playing.  Quite apart from the fact that most of the fight sequences were totally cheesy (not helped by the &quot;Men In Black&quot; style outfits they were all wearing) and were so obviously computer generated, the basic premise for the story was something totally new to me.  The old 'save mankind from disaster' idea was given a totally new spin here, and some very interesting and thought provocative questions came to my mind as I watched the movie - like for example, given the miserable truth of the 'real' world, why would any person want to be 'freed' ?  Personally, I think I would rather have remained enslaved and stayed in the Matrix... as one of the characters says, &quot;ignorance is bliss&quot;.  <br />On another note, the acting surprised me a lot.  I wasn't sure what to expect from a cast led by Keanu Reeves, but the actors were all very fine.  Laurence Fishburne, Hugo Weaving and Carrie-Ann Moss in particular should be highly commended for their performances, and Reeves himself did a good job of portraying the rather enigmatic Neo.  <br />And when all that's considered, one can easily forgive the nearly constant use of special effects - after all, they do add a remarkable atmosphere to the movie, and a little candy for the eyes and ears never hurt anybody.  <br />Overall, an extremely pleasantsurprise, infinitely superior to the usual blow 'em up action movies around today.
B00004Z459|5.0|This is one of my most favorite CDs ever.Every song on here is good,well except for Cure For The Itch.The best song on this CD is Papercut.It just rules.If you don't have this CD,then you should buy it.You will love it.Also check out One Step Closer and Crawling.<br />Peace Out.
B00006F7S4|5.0|Beck is an artists artist, the kind of singer-songwriter that on one record, he writes folk songs, and on the next he does James Brownish funk-rock. He is one of the most essentric songwriters of all time. He has his own style of putting music with lyrics. <BR>He can't do anything wrong musically, because you don't know what he's going to do next. That is why I give Beck so much respect, is because he is not afarid to make a complete 180 on every record.
B000068OCS|5.0|The issue with the aspect ratio of the MGM DVDs of KOYAANISQATSI and POWAQQATSI has come up here and on the Amazon website, among other places.  As a producer and technical advisor on the third Qatsi film, while I was not directly involved in the process of manufacturing these DVDs, I was well aware of the decision-making behind that process. I can say definitively that the 1:1.85 aspect ratio (letter-boxed) on the MGM DVDs accurately reflects the author's intentions and reproduces the original theatrical aspect ratio of the projected films.<br />KOYAANISQATSI and POWAQQATSI were both principally photographed in the 1980s, when widescreen television was a vague idea somewhere off in the future and a large picture tube was 27\\" across.  While conceived as theatrical features, both films were shot with consideration of possible television broadcast, which at that time was almost exclusively full-frame 1:1.33 (4x3). The alternative to \\"protecting\\" for 4x3 by composing the image to work well in full frame would have been to \\"pan and scan\\" the widescreen image when transferred to videotape for home video release and TV broadcast.<br />I am sure that anyone who has seen KOYAANISQATSI and POWAQQATSI would agree the pan and scan approach would have yielded a ludicrous result for these films: for this reason when the films have been broadcast they are presented in  the full \\"academy\\" aperture of 4x3, showing _more_of the original film frame than was shown in the theater.   And when video transfers of the films were made prior to the MGM DVD they were also made 1:1.33. This reflected the conventional practice at the time, when very few films were transferred to video wide-screen. <br />However in the past few years there has been a markedly increased interest in wide-screen home video and the the technical means to display wide-screen video adequately in the home has become commonplace, arising chiefly from the popularity of larger displays.  Reflecting this new environment the decision was taken now  to release the films on DVD in their original 1:1.85 aspect ratio.  I repeat that this image is exactly as originally intended by the director, Godfrey Reggio and the cinematographers.<br />I don't mean to imply that the 4x3 image in earlier transfers is somehow \\"invalid\\".  I think this way of watching the films is very interesting.<BR>It is a mark of how carefully crafted were these films that both ratios work very well. However, in no sense is the viewer of the MGM DVDs \\"losing\\" something by watching the films as they are shown as a motion picture, at 1.85, anymore than the audience was \\"missing something\\" watching the premier of KOYAANISQATSI at Radio City Music Hall in 1983. <br />Joe Beirne<BR>Producer, NAQOYQATSI
B00006AG5N|4.0|I am no fan of Elvis, but I have enjoyed his music when I've heard it. Elv1s 30 #1 Hits is a very good cd for non-fans like myself that just wanted to have a compliation of the King's ouevre. However, I was disappointed that Viva Las Vegas &amp; Blue Suede Shoes were not included. I don't know if they ever reached number one, but they could have been included as bonus tracks. Other than that, it's a pretty good collection.
B00006690F|5.0|His words fuel passion, anger and laughter in one listen. <BR>Eminem is a modern day folk musician.  I believe that rap comes from the same home where folk music was born... the streets.  Eminem brings rap music to its highest level.  As a songwriter he is on the same level as Bruce Springsteen, Michael Stipe or Bob Dylan.  He's that good and The Eminem Show is leaps and bound better than his last CD.  Is this guy going to slow down?  <br />\\"White America\\" is chilling when you hear the words he is saying to the older generation.  The anger in his voice only underlines the urgency of his message.<br />\\"Without Me\\" is MTV Em.  This is one he threw out to satisfy the label & MTV.  Funny stuff, great video.<br />\\"Cleanin Out My Closet\\" - Dear Mom, I'm over you.  <br />A few examples of The Eminem show.  Buy this CD and undersyand that this isn't a man of novelty.

However, I was disappointed that Viva Las Vegas &amp; Blue Suede Shoes were not included. I don't know if they ever reached number one, but they could have been included as bonus tracks. Other than that, it's a pretty good collection.

0385474547|5.0|Chinua Achebe's \\"Things Fall Apart\\" is the story of a man who watches helplessly as his community, quite literally, falls apart.  It takes place, presumably, in Nigeria in the nineteenth century, and the community it portrays is an Ibo clan who live in a group of nine villages collectively called Umuofia.  The protagonist is a man named Okonkwo, as noble a figure as any in literature because he is strong, brave, loyal to his family and his community, respectful of the ways of his ancestors, and strictly adheres to a personal code of honor, which in some ways is a corrective response to his own father's lazy, unprincipled lifestyle.<br />Like most in Umuofia, Okonkwo makes his living as a yam farmer, and he has built a large compound in which he lives with his three wives and numerous children, the most prominent of whom are his oldest son Nwoye and his favorite daughter Ezinma.  Since the Ibo clan is, like most societies throughout the world, a cult of masculinity, anything related to strength or honor is considered manly, and anything related to weakness or irresolution is considered womanly; so Okonkwo regrets that Ezinma, whom he loves and respects more than any of his other children, was not born male.<br />The novel is balanced between sketches of daily life in the villages and three major events that shape Okonkwo's character.  The first event is Okonkwo's adoption of a boy named Ikemefuna from a nearby village as part of a retribution for a crime committed by a resident of that village on a resident of Okonkwo's.  After living three years with Okonkwo's family, Ikemefuna becomes a good friend to Nwoye; but the village elders have decreed a sad fate for the boy, and Okonkwo has no choice but to help carry it out.  The second event is when, at a funeral for a village elder, Okonkwo's gun accidentally explodes and kills a boy; according to tribal law, Okonkwo and his family are banished from Umuofia for seven years and relocate to his mother's native village.<br/>The third event is the arrival in Nigeria of white missionaries from the Church of England.  They begin to transform Ibo society by building churches, schools, and hospitals, and establishing an Anglican government and legal system.  Part of their success is due to their ability to convince the Ibos of the sovereignty of the Christian God, and many Ibos convert.  When Okonkwo returns to Umuofia after his exile and learns that this new religion is supplanting the ancestral traditions, he is disgusted by the weak will of his clansmen and especially his own son Nwoye, who has defected to the Church and taken the name Isaac.  This event has a larger, pan-African significance, in which Okonkwo becomes a symbol of resistance to the encroachment of Europeanization.<br />\\"Things Fall Apart\\" is a short and simple novel, but it masterfully contains, within a uniquely African context, its protagonist's whole philosophy towards life and reason for being.  Whether Okonkwo's actions are to be applauded is left for the individual reader to decide, but there is no mystery about why he does them.  He is nothing if not a man of convictions, and he is willing to die for them, even by his own hand.
6305882592|5.0|This movie was made quite a few years before I was born and I would never have known about it if not for AMC's constant rotation. I admit that the macabre humor perplexed me at first, but the superb cast pulls it off wonderfully. Vivian Pickles, who plays Harold's blissfully clueless mom, is so funny that she could've stolen the movie from the two title characters if she had appeared in more scenes. One of the movie's funniest moments is when she signs Harold up for a dating service and then tells him, \\"They screen out the fat and the ugly, so obviously this is a firm of high standards.\\" All the other great things about 'Harold & Maude' have already been said by the other reviewers. I'm glad that this film is so beloved by so many people. It's a great legacy for Colin Higgins, who wrote such a beautiful book in 1970. Sadly, he passed away in 1988.
B00003CWTI|1.0|Too long.  Too much crying.  And why does every character in this movie have some deep, dark secret from his/her childhood?  BORING!
6304907648|5.0|I've debated over writing a review of this movie simply becase words cannot express how fascinating and brilliant it is.  The plot is seemingly simple:  Sigourney Weaver portrays Dr. Helen Hudson, a retired but brilliant criminal psychiatrist, who is a step ahead of the police in solving a recent rash of murders by a serial killer. Two detectives, played by Dermot Mulroney and the deceptively simple Holly Hunter, lure Hudson back into the fold to aid the police in stopping this killer.  If only it was that simple.  That it's not is what makes this movie great.  Hudson's brilliance is eclipsed by her pill-popping nature and her alcoholism.  She's also agoraphobic, in that she hasn't left her house in 13 months, when she was attacked by the last serial killer she was responsible for incarcerating. Now aided by Hudson, the cops search for a killer who is copycatting murders made famous decades earlier by Son of Sam, the Hillside Stranglers, and the Boston Strangler.  William McNamara is chilling as the psychopath in that he embodies the basic profile of all serial killers.  He's young, handsome, charming, affable and evil to the core.  Just when you think it's all resolved, the final scene is the most shocking of all.
0060989157|5.0|I've read exactly two rock biographies - this one and \\"Walk This Way: The Autobiography of Aerosmith\\".  The second one took me about a year to finish, this one took me all of a week.  I'll let you guess which one I found more interesting.<br />There's very little discussion here about the making of their albums or the stories behind the songs.  It's pretty much all the stuff of tabloid legend - sex, drugs, and rock n' roll, with heavy emphasis on the sex and drugs.  Some of their backstage exploits make Led Zeppelin look like a bunch of choir boys.  <br />Even their respective marriages to women both famous and not are oddly downplayed.  Vince Neil suddenly has a wife and child part way through the book before you even knew what was happening.  You find out later that it was actually his second child and that his first was born when he was only 16 (neither one of these kids are his daughter Skylar, whose tragic death at the age of 4 is discussed in detail in easily the most moving part of the book).  Tommy Lee covers his meeting, dating, and marrying Heather Locklear in one chapter, then pretty mcuh avoids the topic altogether until his divorce (which he sums up in about two pages).  The sections devoted to Pamela Anderson are understandably more in depth, but only because he devotes a whole chapter to his stint in jail for spousal abuse.  <br />Overall, a lurid tale of rock n' roll excess.  It's a wonder these guys are still standing, and that they haven't been riddled with every conceiveable STD known to man (who knows, they probably are).  Despite all this, my favorite line in the book was Tommy Lee saying how he wished they could've toured with artists like Iggy Pop and Husker Du \\"instead of cheese metal bands like Warrant and Whitesnake\\".  Yeah, as if \\"Home Sweet Home\\", \\"Girls Girls Girls\\" or \\"Without You\\" could be considered such edgy, thought-provoking material on a different plain from either of those bands.  I love the Crue, and I also like Warrant and Whitesnake, and I certainly don't consider the Crue's music to be all that much removed from the \\"cheese metal\\" glut that they helped create.
B00005QHPQ|4.0|that Iglesias is basically selling sex.  And there's nothing wrong with that.  After all, the man IS sexy.  The songs are decent and mesh well with his slightly above-average voice.  There's nothing new here.  Just some nice pop fluff.  Iglesias isn't a bad singer, but he fails to emotionally involve me in his music.  It's almost as he's trying TOO hard to show you how passionate he is.  Unfortunately, that resonates throughout the CD...all the songs sound the same.
B000002IP1|2.0|After the absolutely top-notch \\"No Jacket Required\\", it was inevitable that Phil Collins' follow-up would be a letdown.  And it's not that \\"...But Seriously\\" is a bad album, just BORING.  The word of the day here is \\"ballads\\".  Songs vary from moody ballads (\\"That's Just The Way It Is\\", \\"Another Day In Paradise\\"), standard fare heartfelt ballads (\\"Do You Remember?\\", \\"I Wish It Would Rain Down\\", \\"Father To Son\\"), slow groove ballads that transition to slightly-heavy ballads (\\"All Of My Life\\") and ambitious epic ballads (\\"Colours\\").  Elsewhere you find more upbeat, jazz-or-latin influenced numbers (\\"Heat On The Street\\", \\"Saturday Night And Sunday Morning\\", \\"Find A Way To My Heart\\").  All are BORING.    <br />A couple of the more rocking tunes, \\"Hang In Long Enough\\"and \\"Something Happened On The Way To Heaven\\" save this album from being a complete yawner, but both are cut from the same cloth as the far superior \\"Sussudio\\" from \\"No Jacket Required\\".  All of tunes here are admirable compositions and performances, and if you're a diehard PC fan, this'll scratch your itch.  If your tastes lean more toward his work with Genesis or rock music with a bit more of an edge, this album is just plain flat out BORING.
B00004XOWM|2.0|...Hoping to get to that climax, Limp Bizkit quickly pulled out \\"Chocolate Starfish and the Hotdog Flavored Water\\". Not only that, they had the nerve to come out with two premieres at the same time, \\"Rollin\\" and \\"My Generation\\". \\"Rollin\\", however, has got to be one of the more catchier songs...<BR>  Just because of \\"Rollin\\", MTV made high praise of the whole album rather than the song. They had made the album title seem easier so say than hokey pokey. It was quite an idea to put the original and remix songs of \\"Rollin\\", since they'd seem like the only good songs on the album when you summarize it.<BR>The other songs seemed as if even a person with an IQ of 60 were able to write.<BR> Without the intro or outro, the whole album talks about the same exact message. Obviously, that message is \\"us against them\\" or \\"nobody likes me\\" and they seem to just act at that for recignition. Another thing it overuses is cursing. By the time your done listening to the whole thing, hearing somebody yell ... is about as decent as hearing a hummed melody. Such an excellent example is the first song that kicks in, or the next, the one after that, and all of them untill the end.<BR> ...The only message you do get from \\"Hotdog\\" is that it is the most desperate slap at an enemy artist untill Nas made his desperate comback against Jay-Z on \\"StillMatic\\".<BR> ...You've gotta take sympathy to know that this album came from quick action, but it seems that Bizkit is trying to make you think that this is all them, and peoles with good musical taste would definitely take a pass on that.
B0000057C5|5.0|Personaly I think this is the best cd ever! It is the best out of all three of Rammstein's cd's. The best song ever in the world is on this track. It is called Engel (Angel) it has the best guitars ever. If you like this band I recommend Megaherz, Schweisser, and In Extremo. But my favorite out of all of them is Rammstein. Rammstein has nice hard guittars , but not as annoying and consistent as Slipknots. Tills voice sounds great and dark and the drums are awsome, and the keyboard is amazing. Everybody at my high school likes em.
6304907648|5.0|Copycat is a very good 'Cop vs. Killer' -Thriller. A suspensful plot with many twists and the actors and actresses are great: Sigourney Weaver(Alien 1-4) is born for this role. Holly Hunter(The Piano) is amazing, too. The ending keeps you on the edge of your seat. If you enjoyed 'The Silence Of The Lambs', 'Seven', 'Kiss The Girls', 'The Bone Collector' or 'Dressed To Kill' I HIGHLY recommend this masterpiece.
6305428042|5.0|I absolutely love this movie and must have literally seen it 100 times.  It's about 3 witches that come back to life for one night after 300 years.  In order to survive past dawn, they must suck the lives out of the children (not like a vampire though) using a potion from their much prized book of spells.  But the past 300 years have brought on many changes for them that they have to overcome in order to get the book back from 3 kids to make the potion that makes the children susceptible to having the life sucked out of them.  In the end all, good overcomes evil.
B00003CXSP|5.0|This movie is totally amazing. Outstanding. I think the book was bad, but the movie is, better more entertaining. Hannibal was nominated for 3 Academy Awards. yes, I think so.
B000068CNY|5.0|i just recently bought this item and i think it is so great!!<BR>Even if this is the last season for them we will always have the memories on vhs or dvd.  this is one of my favorite shows along with sex and the city of which i also have seasons1-3 (but that's another review), I recommend this to anyone who is a fan, collecter or true FRIEND
B00003CXSP|5.0|The Silence of the Lambs was better, but this one is great, too. The story is suspensful with twists, Anthony Hopkins is great. Julianne Moore is not as good as Jodie Foster, but she's still a great actress. The ending keeps you in the edge of your seat. I highly recommend this movie.
0316666343|3.0|I am always intrigued by novels that have reviews ranging from \\"this is the best book I've ever read to this is the worst thing ever\\".  I would place this book somewhere firmly in the middle, certainly not the worst I've read, and most assuredly not the best.  The premise is certainly fascinating, when we meet our narrator Susie she is talking to us from heaven after her murder.  Susie looks down on her family's ordeal after her murder, and follows the life of her killer as well.  I did have some problems with the lack of emotion displayed by Susie.  I know she's dead and perhaps that's what happens but dead or alive a narrator needs some feeling,and Susie sure didn't have much.  Case in point,about the worst thing she can say about her murderer is \\"that man has no shame\\".  One would expect a slightly more emotional response when discussing one's killer you would think.  Like many other reviewers I did give a groan when Susie inhabits the body of her friend for a romp with her old love (yikes!)  So overall not a bad book, I think it could have been better but worth a read if the premise interests you.

B000002MJ0|5.0|I would have to say I prefer this album to &quot;Loveless.&quot;  The guitars don't fill up the speakers here as much as on that album, but there's still plenty of lush guitar noize to savour.  It must be the unrestrained rocking-out which matches the dream pop that I really love - especially on the second side (beginning with &quot;Feed Me With Your Kiss&quot;).  That side really JAMS in a gleeful kind of way - gives me a great feeling.  &quot;Sueisfine&quot; is pretty trippy and I swear they're really saying 'Suicide' which is a twisted thing to repeat over and over.  &quot;Several Girls Galore&quot; is kinda darker and sensual with bassier drums to match the seductive female vocals.  &quot;Nothing Much To Lose&quot; is another highlight with absolutely spastic drums that do something different each time they cut loose.  This song is one of several that takes dramatic turns, leading the listener to surprisingly different places - a bit like 2 or 3 songs in 1.  <br />Side 1 has some real gems on it as well, but I'm not too crazy about the slower songs &quot;Lose My Breath&quot; and &quot;No More Sorry.&quot;  They're not great musically; they're quite a bit atonal in fact. However, I've gotten more used to them in time.  &quot;All I Need&quot; is another slow one which might take some getting used to, but its brilliance shines through with its V.U. pulse and shimmering guitar backdrop.  To be honest, Kevin Shields doesn't have the strongest vocal quality, but I dig it none-the-less.  These minor drawbacks aren't nearly enough to deny this album the 5 star rating it deserves.
B00003CXSP|5.0|HANNIBAL IS THE BEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN. SUPERB THE SCENES AND JULIANNE MOORE IS HOT. WAIT TILL SUMMER: RED DRAGON IS WATCHING YOU!
0316776963|4.0|\\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" is Sedaris' fourth collection of stories.  This book contains some hilarious moments in \\"You Can't Kill the Rooster\\" about his brother, Paul, and \\"Jesus Shaves\\" about French lessons.  There are plenty of laugh-out-loud moments in this book.  If you've enjoyed David's other offerings, \\"MTPOD\\" is for you.
B00005JKG7|5.0|This movie was very cool. Love it. Worth buying. Hey it's John Carpenter, and if it was made before 1990, heck, you know it'll be good. It's scary, and has zombies in it. See it, see it, and see it.
0345441184|4.0|With this book, I found that it moved along effortlessly from the viewpoint of Igraine, through to Viviane, then Morgaine and Morgause, leaving me at the end with an impressively wide perspective of the events of about 50 years.  At the end I found that, although I could not remember the journey, I knew where I'd been.  This is an amazing book for anyone interested in King Arthur and the knights of the round table.  If you were a fan of Tamora Pierce when you were younger, this is also for you.
B000059T1E|5.0|This review is for that hard-corps Traffic fan who doesn't know whether two additional songs is worth buying the album again. I debated, having owned &quot;John Barleycorn&quot; for so long and finding it hard to picture new songs entering arguably their best album.  However, how could anyone settle for an incomplete collection?! &quot;I Just Want you to Know&quot; elaborates on the theme from Empty Pages, and breaks down into a really groovy jam with harmonizing vocals. &quot;Sittin' Here&quot; is a bit indulgent of Winwood's softer side, but adds a new finish to the album that is refreshing. Of course, it makes it wonder whether there were just these two songs worthy of being added, or are they dragging out this remastered phase.
0805062971|5.0|I don't remember the last time I was so impressed by a book.  I have to admit, I still haven't seen the movie, and although I've heard that it's every bit as good as the book, I'm still a bit cautious, because I don't want to spoil the feeling I got after reading this.<br />It's the most twisted story I've ever read, and yet it was never hard to follow.  I made the mistake of beginning to read it in the company of other people, and about 6 times per page I stopped to read bits out, trying to show them how incredible even the first few pages were.  I had a really hard time putting it down.<br />When you pick this book up, be prepared to be challenged.  This book is filled with ideas - scary, intimidating, and at times downright insane, but you'll think twice about your actions and the actions of others after you've finished.  &quot;Fight Club&quot; moves on from one big event onto the next, even bigger one, on a scale that seems immesurable at times.  Some parts are shocking, and create a completely different narrating character than the one you find in most contemporary novels.  You get the feeling that he isn't quite balanced right from the beginning, and you move onto new heights of doubt and, for lack of a better word, weirdness.<br />If you haven't seen the movie, you have to read this book before you see the movie.  I always find that the way a book unravels a plot like this one is better than the way a movie can, although, I've heard that the movie does a really good job as well.  But if you HAVE seen the movie - READ THIS ANYWAY!!  There are parts in the book that you won't find in the movie, guaranteed.  And they are just as important as anything else.  Palahniuk is a master with the written word.
B00000IWVS|5.0|I first experienced Martha Argerich in a piano trio concert at Carnegie Hall earlier this year, and since then I have been intrigued by her work. This CD offers some amazing performances of Chopin that definitely hold the listener's attention and express the emotion and power behind Chopin's music. Though I am not a huge fan of Chopin, I definitely think this CD is an excellent introduction to his music, particularly as Argerich relates so well the power, brilliance, and majesty of his music.
B000002LCK|5.0|One of the high points of a generation, this be-all and end-all of its genre is a must for any new-wave-esque collection. In this world of endless, artistically inept hip-hop, this is a nice escape back to the golden age of 'alternative' before the baby boomers turned alternative into a deluge of mainstream, il-talented young-boy bands. The creativity, talent, and skill of New Order and their Substance album is exceptional.
B000068TPN|2.0|Synopsis: We Were Soldiers tells the story of the first large-scale battle between U.S. forces and North Vietnamese, November 14-16, 1965, in the Central Highlands of Vietnam. The fight was also the first test of our Army's brand new \\"air mobile\\" tactical doctrine, which would become a signature of U.S. troop deployment in Vietnam. Lt. Colonel Hal Moore and 450 men of the 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment (George Custer's old outfit), were inserted by helicopter into the Ia Drang Valley, where Army Intelligence suspected that North Vietnamese Army (NVA) units were headquartered. What Moore and his men didn't know, but were about to find out, was that several NVA divisions - numbering thousands of troops - were waiting for them in the Chu Pong Massif overlooking the Ia Drang. After three days of constant, fierce fighting and severe attrition to both sides, the North Vietnamese broke off the engagement and left the field to the Americans. <br />The movie follows Hal Moore (Mel Gibson), as he prepares his green troops for Vietnam, then chronicles their bloody struggle at Landing Zone X-Ray in the Ia Drang. It also highlights the effect of the struggle on the families left behind, including Moore's wife Julie (Madeleine Stowe) and children. <br />The Good: We Were Soldiers benefits from the talents of such likeable stars as Greg Kinnear, Sam Elliot, Barry Pepper, and of course Mel Gibson. It also devotes some time to the North Vietnamese view of the battle, which is unique and welcome. <br />The Bad: An instructive comparison can be drawn between We Were Soldiers and Ridley Scott's Black Hawk Down. Both are based on true stories of Americans who faced battles against long odds and prevailed through skill and courage. Whereas Black Hawk Down hews very close to its unflinchingly objective source material, though, We Were Soldiers pulls out all the stops to manipulate our feelings. Randall Wallace, who shanked one last year with Pearl Harbor, errs even more grievously this time with a cheesy script and heavy-handed direction. His players are good, but they can't save this one. Shame on Wallace for failing to do justice to Hal Moore and Joe Galloway's moving yet unsentimental account of the battle. <br />The Bottom Line: The Vietnam War has produced a remarkable crop of great films. We Were Soldiers is not one of them. Read the book instead.
B00005JLF5|5.0|I think the 2 hour premier episode of DS9 is one of the best films ever made.  What more can I say?<br />I don't understand why many hardcore trekkies did not like this series, but then again, I don't understand hardcore trekkies.
B000069HK2|4.0|This cd is definately a breath of freash air in a stale nu metal world.  Highly original while still completely capable of being un offensive or too over the top.

B00006F7S4|5.0|Listening to the most recent work from Beck inevitably brings Pink Floyd and Velvet Underground, to mind; in particular one of Floyd's most psychodelic albums, &quot;More&quot;, and Velvet Underground's self titled album. However, Beck goes beyond just refrying music from the sixties. He incorporates elements of contemporary prog rock, which give the twelve songs that make up &quot;Sea Change&quot; the unmistakable seal of being ahead of their time once more, even if they -in a sense- constitute a revival of the psychedelic works from times past.<br />If you take the album, it's VERY difficult to say which song is better than the other. You should listen to it all as a whole and enjoy the fact that Beck came back with a more downbeat (sadder, if you may) album, much like Duncan Sheik would (of course, maintaing the distance between the artists). Yes, it is one blue album, that confirms once more that Beck is in perfect tune with the times: these difficult times from which we have a hard time finding a way out.
B00003CXAY|5.0|I just watched this movie tonight for the first time in years and it was GREAT!! The music as well as all of the cinematography was very well done! I had forgotten about some of the music segments that are in the movie but do not appear on the cd soundtrack to my knowledge.<BR>The sound was really awesome too! I was blown away by the opening segment!<br />A must have for any art film or Philip Glass fan!
B00003CWL6|5.0|That word could sum up my first experience of this movie. I remember that for the first time in my cinephile life, I was litterally floored, unable to stand up from my seat. Everything in this movie was perfect, from the soundtrack, to the actor's play (Kevin Spacey offers his best in this moving drama of a not so normal, not so static life), but what really stuck me was twofold. First, the director had evidently the exact same vision of beauty that I had, everything visual in there was an artful masterpiece of color and beauty. Second, this vision of beauty was also the same poetically. The scene with the flying bag, and the memorable ending monologue are scenes that brought tears to my dumbstruck eyes. This movie profoundly affected me, and I know I had been changed when I exited the theatre for the first (but far from last) time. The DVD captures this masterpiece as best as a not-viewed-in-theatres support can, and this is a movie that should be in everyone's DVDtheque.
0679721037|3.0|When I read the book Hirsoshima I was a bit dissapointed. I was given a Language Arts Project, which I had to read a novel and do twenty entries. I chose Hiroshima, because I thought i would be able to learn more about history and what not. I learned more about history, yes, but the book in itself was quite dumb in my opinion. The book is about when we (America) dropped the Atomic bomb on Japan. It tells the story of six Japanese people, and what they had to do to survive throughout the \\"war\\". Having six people, however, made the book very hard to follow. John Hersey (the author of the book) had to switch stories every three or four paragraphs, so that got pretty annoying and hard to follow. If your are looking for a book to read for a history project, this is one I would reccomend. If you are looking for a book to read just for the sake of a good book, this is one that is good, but hard to follow. Not recommended. By me anyway. Thank you for reading this reveiw, I hope this helped you with your decision of the book.             Mitch Smucker
B00006BTCA|5.0|Just when I was sick of listening to the same [music], this album comes out and the first time I listened to it, I ended up listening to it all day on repeat. What's this? Dark beautiful melodies, vocals that cut through you, a driving rhythm that makes you want to jump up and down until you rip the headphone plug out...this is the best album I have heard since Kid A. It has a great 80's feel to it and combines apsects of many bands I love, already mentioned here, to create a sound which is indescribable. The album is dense and melodic, the lyrics are cryptic and catchy, with random strokes of brilliance, but the rhythm is what brings it all together.<BR>\\"I can't pretend I need to defend some part of me from you\\" <BR>\\"we'll collect those lonely parts and set them down<BR>you come here to me<BR>she says she thinks her loves a pony<BR>my love's subliminal\\". <br />I found myself waking up in the middle of the night with the melodies of the songs in my head, I can't get them out of my mind. I guess I've been addicted to this album since I first heard the melody from the first track and I still get chills when I listen to this album. If you like the smiths, talking heads and other great 80's bands, I think you'll love this album, and also appreciate the moderness it brings to the sound, will still retaining a 80's feeling. So quit reading the reviews and go buy it, just be careful you don't get addicted to listening to it.
B00005T30L|1.0|this movie was so bad that my girlfriend revoked my renting privileges.  we both usually like lesser known comedies but couldn't get into this one at all.  the art class scenes were amusing, but that's about it.  we kept waiting for more, and it just wasn't there.

B00003CXXJ|5.0|This was one of the best animated films I have seen in a long time.  Mike Myers does the voice of shrek brilliantly and I thought Eddie Murphy was excellent as donkey.  The jokes are new and plentiful and the storyline is a work of art.  Cameron Diaz does the voice of the lovely princess Fiona who Shrek, with a little help (and hindrance) from donkey, has to save in order to get rid of all the fairytale creatures that have moved into shrek's swamp.  The sub characters are also brilliant, one of my favourite being the gingerbread man.  Also, the kareoke piece at the end of the film (after the credits) was hilarious.  Watch it; it's one of the best films you'll see this year.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|I mean that the acting and plot are tragically bad and the singing evokes a gag response that will make you wish you hadn't eaten the fish for dinner.  <br />It is hilarious that THIS movie was so popular.  This movie is positive proof that the ONLY things important in selling movies to people nowadays are a couple of well-knowns, a large budget, and a seedy reputation.  <br />Personally, I'd take great writing and raw talent over big names and hype any day.
B00006AG5N|5.0|Oh my God! I was expecting better sound based on what I'd read on the net and other places. But I never expected this: the hype turned out to be fact. Listen to \\"Suspicious Minds\\", \\"Burning Love\\" or \\"Return To Sender\\" and compare them to the previous versions. I'd been in the midst of making myself a disc of favorite Elvis songs and I was waiting for 30 #1 Hits to be released. Now that I can hear these new songs along side the other Elvis songs, the other songs sound weak and muddy.    It would be wonderful if RCA would re-release the recent Suspicious Minds CD remastered the same way. Even better yet, make it SACD or DVD-Audio!     Elvis music sounds fresh, new and exciting again. By all means, get this CD.
B0000542D2|5.0|A Hard Days Night brings back all the wonderful memories of my teenage years in England, going wild for any sign of the Beatkes whether it be live or on the TV.  Buying their records as soon as they came out, dancing to their music at the Palais De Danse or Colmans dance hall.  I think we are so overloaded with modern technical \\"stuff\\" that we may review this flick in the wrong light instead of letting it bring back the youth in us.  I love it as I love all the Beatles music, films etc. but then coming from England I am biased.  They didn't have to be great actors, it was the moment that we loved and lived. &lt;...
B000002KXV|5.0|It's as if Fagen wrote a novel and put it to music.  The images are so clear.  I wasn't a young man growing up in the late 50's, in the northeast, but I feel I know just what he was going through.   <br />It's amazing his evocation of a youthful time--as powerful as that, for example, of the songs of Brian Wilson.<br />Fagen captures perfectly the feeling of a young adult when he sings: &quot;what a beautiful world this will be; what a glorious time to be free.&quot;  Didn't we all feel a bit of that at a certain age?  <br />The opening chords of &quot;I.G.Y.&quot; are like a soundtrack to a movie.  &quot;New Frontier&quot; is certainly a dance tune to stand with any. Although &quot;Nightfly&quot; is a pop album, Fagen gives us a good measure of jazz chords and alternate time signatures.  A touch of sophistication, perhaps.  In any event, it's a classic.
B000065V41|5.0|Disney and Henson have really got it right with The Muppet Christmas Carol DVD. <br />The DVD has a stunning menu with a newly-recorded introduction and hilarious sarcastic navigational advice from Kermit. The menu begins with a Dikendian snowy scene of rooftops which then pans to a snow encrusted CGI window inside a fire-lit Victorian house. Here the new sound and video footage of Kermit in yuletide attire plays over the animated menu of snow falling. After some time, Kermit plays hide and seek whilst he waits, impatiently, for you to select your choice.<br />With a swoop of CGI animation, the Special Features are on another menu, which has also music and newly recorded Kermit puppetry and a roaring Yuletide fire. Here you will find the extras - a wonderful and entertaining `Behind the Scenes' with Rizzo and Gonzo, `Audio Commentary' Option, `Christmas Around the World' feature and a `unique' on the set extra! Amazing!<br />The menus are true to the magic of Christmas, Disney and The Muppets! This is one Disney release you'll love - real thought and imagination have gone into the production and it shows. It's a Christmas DVD gem - alas, in 1.33:1 but in glorious 5.1 DD Surround which is noticable.
B000067CPX|5.0|When I first listened to &quot;By the Way,&quot; I did not quite know what to think about it.  It was different from &quot;Californication&quot;, which was my favorite album.  Then I listened again and I fell in love with the entire CD.  The Red Hot Chili Peppers surprised me yet again with an amazing cd.  I immediatley fell in love with &quot;The Zephyr Song&quot; and &quot;On Mercury&quot;.  As I listen on, the songs keep getting better and better.  I strongly recommend this CD to any rock fan.
0684803356|3.0|Hemmingway paints an interesting picture of guerilla activity on behalf of the Republic during the Spanish Civil War and offers convincing insight into what motivates a soldier--particularly one who isn't even a native of Spain. <br />But, like most of the &quot;great&quot; American male writers of the 20th century, his grip on love and women is loose at best. The &quot;girl&quot; Maria who wins his heart at first sight is barely 19, &quot;moves like a colt&quot; and repeatedly vows to please him in every way--&quot;I will wash the socks for thee, and fix thy supper,&quot; etc., etc.--as soon as this pesky war is over with. <br />Yes, yes, Pilar is a strong female character with an interesting past and clearly defined motives. But she's not worthy of being loved because she is no longer young and never was beautiful. Hemmingway even puts the words into her own mouth.<br />Perhaps Hemmingway was trying to be too ambitious by throwing a love story into this book--either he was too lazy to make it very believable, or he really didn't understand love or women anyway (his personal life might attest to this). In any case, perhaps he should've just stuck with the war in this novel.<br />I much preferred the interesting relationship depicted in &quot;The Sun Also Rises.&quot;
B000002J1U|5.0|To appease you Zeppelin fans who prefer their harder side, &quot;Since I've Been Loving You,&quot; is the most moving blues jam they ever did, and possibly the most emotional of any blues jam. Plant's vocals scream it all, along with Page's solos, Jones' organs, and Bonham's drumming. I loved &quot;Tangerine,&quot; &quot;Gallows Pole,&quot; and &quot;That's The Way.&quot; &quot;Immigrant Song&quot; rocks too. Not a bad Zeppelin album at all. Perhaps, it's one of their best, though it's a very tough choice for me. I dunno why people worship ZOSO so much but criticize this one. Acquired taste I guess.
B00006BTCA|5.0|I won't rehash what positives have been already said about this release, but suffice it to say that this year has spawned some serious rock, whatever the subgenre.  Interpol's 'Turn On The Bright Lights'; The Church 'After Everything Now This'; The Flaming Lips 'Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots', and Rush 'Vapor Trails' are standouts for 2002!
B000002J0B|5.0|Bye bye blues-rock and folk songs. I thinK Zeppelin knew that they played the format they did on their previous 4 records to death, so being the smart men they were, they went in a new direction. <BR><br />The Song Remains The Same - Great opener, with bad lyrics (not that they were great lyricists anywyas, most of them were kock offs of blues standards anyhow), and Plant's vocals seemed to be wearing thin due to belting out his voice for 4 years and the ridiculous amount of drugs he and his bandmates were fond of. (4/5)<BR><br />The Rain Song - The prettiest Zeppelin song over. Kicks Stairway straight in the rear end!!!! It even has soem decent lyrics too! John Paul Jones' mellotron and piano arrangements rivaled those of Rick Wakeman of Yes on this album! 5/5<BR><br />Over The Hills and Far Away - Always enjoyed the riffs on this song. 5/5 <BR><br />The Crunge - John Bonham does an excellent job switching from the complez time signatures, but Plant's vocals are bad here, so are the lyrics, and whatever that synth thing Jones does. 2/5 <BR><br />Dancing Days - Contains one of the best riffs Zeppelin ever did, and one of the strangest too, in a very weird and hard-rocking way. Eastern-influenced?? Probably. (5/5) <BR><br />D'Yer Maker - An attempt on reggae that actually works!!! (Some disagree on this one though). (4/5) <BR><br />No Quarter - Zeppelin's finest song to date!!! The synth-bass solo-type thing with the piano in the middle keeps me up for days at a time. And Plant's vocals are totally dreary on this song! (5/5) <BR><br />The Ocean - Besides Plant's screeching, it's just another Zeppelinr rocker that's awesome. I even dug the a capella part (5/5). <BR><br />Overall, Zeppelin's newer sound worked for them, and they created another rock classic. Those who dislike this and miss out on No Quarter and The Rain Song.. I pity thee.
B00006F7S4|5.0|We all know that breaking up is hard to do. Somewhere between listening to Bob Dylan's prolific Blood on the Tracks, Joy Division's beautiful \\"Love Will Tear Us Apart\\" and Jeff Buckley's heartbreaking \\"Last Goodbye\\", I think we get the point that breaking up is a real melancholic deal.  So it's little surprise that Beck's new album, Sea Change, reportedly about the break up between him and his longtime girlfriend, is about as cheery as an empty house in the dead of winter.  That's not to say that it's not a superb album; Sea Change is Beck's greatest album since his classic Odelay.<BR>  The album starts off with the forlorn lullaby \\"The Golden Age\\" in which he admits \\"These days\ I hardly get by\ I don't even try\\".  Beck hasn't been this open since 1998's sarcastically damper Mutations, and the only song on that record to reach this kind of emotional grab was the solemn \\"Nobody's Fault but My Own\\".  96's Odelay and 99's Midnite Vultures were fantastic, but songs like \\"Milk and Honey\\", \\"The New Pollution\\" and \\"Hollywood Freaks\\" offered up little for emotional resonance.  Sea Change offers up only emotion, and it's the grim type.  \\"Paper Tiger\\" rides on a wavy bass line and has orchestras floating in and out of the background while Beck mumbles \\"There's no road back to you\\".  The music gets a little more cheerful on \\"Lost Cause\\" but with its chanting chorus of \\"Baby, I'm a Lost Cause\\", it doesn't stray too far.  But all the funky, happy rhythms that Beck has made in his career can outweigh the utter glacier chill of the heart wrenching \\"Lonesome Tears\\".  Beck howls under a maze of orchestras at the chorus \\"How could this love/Ever changing/Never change the way I feel\\" in a voice that would make the reaper sob.  The song is haunting and sits itself right next to your heart.  The entire album hits a spot in the listener's gut where it won't come loose.  In a world of mostly forgettable and redundant music, Sea Change is a gem, even if the edges cut.
B00005OAIE|5.0|But it's not Dave Matthews Band.<br />This guy has a style all his own.  Every song on here is worth listening to.  It's great to see that good, solid songwriting, with well-crafted melodies and lyrics, isn't dead yet.  &quot;No Such Thing&quot; and &quot;Your Body is a Wonderland&quot; are terrific songs (and if the latter doesn't put you in the mood for making love with the one you're with, nothing will--it's an incredible tune), but so, too, are the other ones on here.  Go ahead, buy it for &quot;Wonderland,&quot; but listen to the entire CD.  You'll be hooked.
B000065SCT|4.0|This movie is an incredible animation great for the whole family.  Mr. Potato Head gave an outstanding performance.
B00004WG2X|5.0|This is a wonderfully filmed version of the classic Pride &amp; Prejudice. The screenplay was written by the witty Fay Weldon and follows the original story much more accurately than the A&amp;E schmozzle. I've already worn out one set of tapes...!
B000068QVN|4.0|&quot;Live The 1971 Tour&quot; was the first disk issued to kick off the new Grand Funk Railroad remastering project.  The set contains live trio versions of songs from the 1971 tour.  The set contains material from various venues including their famous Shea Stadium concert in New York City.  The sound quality is rather raw but passable for the this time period.  The disk was issued without overdubs as evidenced by the tuning problems in &quot;Are You Ready&quot; and &quot;Paranoid&quot;. The set contains 11 tracks the same number as the &quot;Live Album&quot; from the 1970 tour. However, the 1971 disk contains great live versions of the medley &quot;I'm Your Captain/Closer To Home/Hooked On Love/Get It Together, a ultra heavy version of the Rolling Stones' &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot; and &quot;Footstompin' Music&quot;, while the 1970 live set contains &quot;In Need&quot;, &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; and &quot;Mean Mistreater&quot; and &quot;Mark Says Alright&quot; instead.  Personally, I favor the set list on the 1971 set. The 1971 set hits its stride near the end with long barnstorming versions of the Animals' &quot;Inside Looking Out&quot; and &quot;Into The Sun&quot; which along with &quot;T.N.U.C&quot; also appear on the live disk from 1970.  The version of &quot;T.N.U.C&quot; included here clocking in at over 15 minutes lasts too long perhaps but it is an example of the jamming that some the bands of the early seventies favored in concert.  In summary, while not essential I enjoyed this disk more than the &quot;Live Album&quot; from 1970&quot; and despite some tuning problems it shows the excitement that Grand Funk Railroad was capable of generating in concert.  I hope the new remasters will contain some more live unissued cuts as bonus tracks.
B00005JLF5|5.0|Deep Space Nine meshes very well with the Next Generation and Voyager Series, sharing the same fictional universe and some characters.  The plot has some metaphysical/supernatural aspects that might not appeal to hard-science fiction fans, but I think that this part of the story is skillfully integregated.<br />I would would buy this series if the studio put it out on DVD.  Then I wouldn't have to stay up until midnight to see reruns on UPN.
B00005JLF5|5.0|Decades from now, DS9 will undoubtedly be considered one of Trek's finest achievements. But be warned -- this is not your grandmother's Trek. It's dark, it's political, it's very realistic, and after seeing it you won't be the same person. <br />Newcomers to the series should be warned. DS9 is made up of many ongoing storylines. Unlike The Next Generation, you can't buy just one season of DVD's and expect to really understand what the show is all about. Doing ths would be like taking one chapter out of the Bible and then proclaiming that you understand what the Bible is. It doesn't work that way. You must see DS9 in its entirety and IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER before you can really appreciate how much of an achievement it is. Some episodes can be understood individually as \\"stand-alones,\\" but most of them involve ongoing themes and storylines that provide a backdrop and a context for what is going on. Basically, I would suggest that you either get the whole series, or save your money and watch it on TNN when they start showing it. <br />Seasons 1 and 2 are a little slow at first, but don't give up. Both seasons have some classic episodes which play an important role in the development of the series and its characters. But when you hit the Season 2 finale \\"The Jem'Hadar\\" prepare for a side of Star Trek you never thought you'd see. <br />That's all I have to say. <br />Walk with the prophets. And remember:<br />Niners aren't linear; we're everywhere!
B000035Z1Z|4.0|Don't listen to the review above given by amazon.com..or chosen by amazon.com to represent this movie.  This is a fun, light-hearted, comedy that can be watched over and over again.  I enjoy this...It is one of the only \\"chick-flick movies\\" that I'd watch if I happened to surf to it on TBS or whatever.<br />The performance by Meg Ryan is very good...as always...and Kevin Kline is also fun, although I did find his accent a little annoying at times.  I really enjoy watching this movie.  I guess its kind of addictive.<br />For DVD fanatics...the disc is not packed full of special features, the sound isn't amazing, the picture quality is average (for DVDs), but the story is fun.<br />Besides...this is a cheap DVD to own...and well worth the 15 bucks to watch it on rainy days.
B000069AUI|4.0|For anyone who has herd Coldplay's first ablumn and wondering weather to get the second one, U won't be disapointed!! Right from the opening track Politik you'll be completely sumberged in ther incredible sounds, feelings and immaculate lyrics whick Coldplay have captured. The second track In My Place is already a hit in many countries which is a fresh studio cut for any of u fans down here in Aus who herd it at The Big Day Out a few year back. Track four is the most immaculate peice on the cd. The lyrics would be enough to send any brocken heart running back to the phone. The Scientist features Chris on his poiano singing his heart out which only brings to mind the similarities between this and the hit off there first albumn trouble. After that the Albumn takes a much need lift, and brings the up-tempo numbers like daylight, which are finely mixed to create an energy of empathy with fun loving. This is one to get and play as you like, anytime, any mood, it'll take U there!!!<BR>Can't wait to hear \\"The Scientist\\" in the charts. Its a sure fire single, and the boys should be ... if they don't release it!!
B0000640VN|4.0|Meg Ryan is really the only reason I went ahead and rented this movie as she is a true gem.  Turns out the story is really enchanting and romantic, and well almost completely believable.  I must say that was an interesting way to get rid of the character who brought Leopold back by dropping him down an elevator chute.  I found Hugh Jackman to be excellent in this role, truly charming, though sometimes it is over the top.  I'm referring to the scene on the rooftop, violin and all...okay, maybe not over the top for the true gentleman Leopold is..but I can see male viewers rolling their eyes at this scene as female viewers say &quot;why don't you do that for me?&quot;<br />All in all, it was a terrific film with a fantastic script.  It had me daydreaming again.
B00005T30L|5.0|This movie will appeal to artists, writers, thinkers and other \\"square pegs\\" who at one time or another felt completely disenfranchised with the world at large.<br />The story involves two displaced teens inhabiting that zone between high school, college, or that slacker, $7.00 an hour job. That zone where you have to face the music and decide who you really are, what you want to be, and how you are going to get there. In other words, do you capitulate amd do the safe thing by listening to everybody else? Or do you face the consequences of potentially screwing up by just being yourself. (The odds, as we know, are stacked against being yourself.)<br />It took me a while to \\"get\\" this movie since the environment itself plays a \\"character\\".  That is to say, convienece stores, cell-block apartment buildings, trendy coffee shops, the local movieplex, and even an adult store. Subsequently the environment becomes this constraining factor in all of these people's lives thus illustrating how our environment shapes us.<br />Thora Birch's performance is flawless as was all of the other actors. Her wardrobe is awesome. (Every outfit she wore from head to toe must of cost a thousand bucks but it looked like you could put it together from a thrift shop.) But then again, Thora Birch is definately not hard to look at!!!<br />The music was good, lot's of blues and silly pop. ... <br />The dialog is intelligent, though the story is not your standard issue plot. This is not a \\"two-dogs-but-only-one-bone\\" type of story line. The story is about choices and consequences and how the environment itself has a say in it.<br />Another neat point is that the daughter of R. Crumb, the counter culture comic book guy did all of the artwork in the lead character's sketchbook.  (She draws a lot like her dad.)<br />It's worth owning, for sure!
0792165020|1.0|Pretentious, slow moving, and unbelievable. I felt embarrassed for Matt Damon throughout this entire film.  He cannot turn in a convincing performance to save his life.  How the other characters in the film couldn't see through Mr. Ripley's shallowness is surreal.  This astonishment totally subverts the audience's ability to suspend disbelief and begins to sink this tawdry film almost from the first reel.  The most excruciatingly dull film experience I've had in a long time.
B00005R23Z|5.0|I rate this film excellent! I do not know if it proves that we have a soul as others suggest, but it does present some very good ideas about the future. After all, \\"science fiction is not the future, it's a twisted view of the present.\\" If you like this be sure to grab the soundtrack as well, which is impeccable at recreating the scenes you see in the movie.<br />The quality of the symbolism in this movie is unmatched in any other movie I've seen before. The producers and directors did a great job with this, and it is the perfect chance for a great story to shine through.<br />As an idea, this movie excels in all aspects. All in all, fascinating camera work and excellent locales. One particular scene will leave you blown away.<br />Science fiction used to be called \\"science romantic\\" for good reason. I've found that all science fiction tends to involve a typical romance of some kind, whether it be a love for the future or a sexual relationship, but mostly it's a love and passion for new ideas that can truly change the world around you. This film does not stray from that. Even if you've seen clips of that one genetic-related scene shown on Charlie Rose 4 times, this film won't disappoint.
6305781427|5.0|I was very excited to discover Acropolis on DVD. I used to have the video and a smaller television. I now have a 43 inch television and stereo system and was expecting to step into the picture to experience that evening with Yanni.<br />I love this concert -- have seen it many times on VHS years ago. I totally understand their acoustic problems involved, and that DVD's weren't in existence back when this concert took place. Regardless, I regret to say that they should NOT have released this on DVD unless they could overcome these sound and picture quality problems. The Tribute DVD is superior to this one in terms of its professinal, high quality production.
B00005O3VC|4.0|A clever comedy starring the troupe from \\"Monty Python\\".<br />Graham Chapman stars as King Arthur in the quest for the Holy Grail. Follow the farce as they meet horny women, the rescue from the tower, the bridge of death & the killer rabbit.<br />So grab your coconut shells and gallop along with the troupe.<br />Includes funny animations by Gilliam.
B00003CXAY|2.0|Finally, the first two movies of the Qatsi-Trilogy are available on DVD. Since the movies are an individually different experience (hypnotic and mind-boggling for one, dull and boring for others) I won't try to explain the content.<BR>The DVD Version is 16:9 enhanced which is, in fact, a mutilation of the original 4:3 picture. The cover states \\"as seen in theaters\\", but I have seen it in theaters many times and never saw it vertically chopped like this. Essential parts of the picture are missing, all this just to please people, who like<BR>their 16:9 TV-screens filled. What is the point in omitting vertical information just to enhance the resolution of the cropped picture? You can see in almost every frame that there is something wrong, not fitting quite well. This is simply because the camerapeople certainly filmed most of the footage in 4:3, not with modern widescreen-lunacy in mind. I don't really enjoy the DVD's, I rather put in the VHS copy of Koyaanisqatsi made from Laserdisc or the german DVD-version of Powaqqatsi, which is in the correct non-cropped aspect ratio. 16:9 enhancement is fine when done on widescreen movies, but not this time.<BR>5 stars for the movies, 2 stars for the DVD's.
6305127638|5.0|Truly the BEST STTNG film of all time in which Picard must tackle his arch-enemy the Borg who have traveled back in time to prevent the birth of Starfleet.
B000002LCU|5.0|Cloud 9 was a return to form for George Harrison.  Many of his All Star Friends-Eric Clapton, Elton John, Ringo Starr, Jim Keltner, and Jeff Lynne are featured here.  All these tracks are so spunky and upbeat with catchy hooks galore. Maybe not as spiritually focued as All Things Must Pass but certainly all these songs are of high quality. And they fit very well with the style of the day. A top 10 Beatle Solo Record for sure.
B00006F7S4|5.0|If this does not win best album of the year, then there is something sincerely wrong with modern music and its fans.  There hasn't been music this earnest, sincere, and beautiful since before I was born.  Yes, Beck is sad, miserable, it sounds like, but this album transcends emotion.  This album is so great, it makes me feel good, despite its down-tempo arrangements and depressing subject matter.  It's enlivening just to hear an album this great.  Stand-out tracks include &quot;The Golden Age&quot;, &quot;Paper Tiger&quot;, &quot;Lonesome Tears&quot; [my personal favorite], and &quot;Sunday Sun&quot;.<br />Hype aside, you will regret not buying this album.  In a week or so when everybody starts to talk about Sea Change and its greatness, you'll feel silly for not running out for it before Gideon Yago or Kurt Loder or whoever tells you to.
B00006F7S4|5.0|I dont' even follow Beck but I love this disc.... If you liked this one, you should try out Nick Drake, Leonard Cohen and PULP,... AND lest we forget the great Scott Walker. Being down never sounded so good!
B00006J3WH|5.0|A great episode, a great CD. Bonus, the suite from Hush. I didn't realize how haunting it was, better than a lot of stuff in big budget movies.
B00006F7S4|1.0|Despite the Aladdin Sane cover this is the worst Mac Davis record ever.
0380820846|4.0|Julia Quinn's Fourth &quot;Bridgerton&quot; Novel is a grate read. If ypu have read the Duke &amp; I, The Viscount who Loved Me and An Offer from a Gentleman, you are sure to enjoy this novel. Great laughs and fun, although not as good as &quot;The Viscount who Loved Me&quot;.
0553381709|5.0|I couldn't give any of the books in this trilogy less than 5 stars.  I was introduced into the world of fantasy by Wheel of Time, but after reading R.R. Martin's books I don't think I could return to such one-dimensional characters.  George handles his characters with such great detail that each and every one of them (even the bad guys) is a rounded human being in your eyes.  He also weaves magic into his world so subtly it becomes perfectly plausible as reality.  I can't wait for the fourth book!
B00003CXCT|4.0|For me, this is still the most convincing star wars movie.  Its plot progression flows very naturally, and there is very little dialog that feels artificial to me.  I can watch this movie over and over, and it is still entertaining every time even after all these years.  <br />It's true that the acting in this movie is pretty bad by the likes Harrison Ford and Mark Hamill, but Alec Guiness, Peter Cushing, and James Earl Jones give superb performances IMO.<br />I'm one who prefers the Special Edition release vs. the old version, but I hope Lucas will release both on DVD.
0571202284|5.0|This book is jam-packed with information and inspiration.  The author is an intimidatingly good animator who will make most of us wish we could draw half as well as he does, and he has worked with some legendary figures.  His feature films, including WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT?, have been landmarks in recent animation history.<br />The book focuses mainly on the most basic movements of animated human and humanoid figures.  Mr Williams has the vast experience to speak authoritatively of the easiest mistakes to make, as well as ways to make your own work sparkle.  His own drawing is always fabulous, even when at its most simple.<br />Any animator in any field will find this book hugely useful.  And ..., it is a real bargain!
0140185232|4.0|(This review is written largely in reaction to certain reviews here on Amazon.com.) Like others here, I too enjoyed The Razor's Edge very much. As one who is drawn to explore the mysteries within (or without, or wherever one happens to feel that they are located) I personally found it thrilling to feel that I was bonding with the main character, Larry, and to hear him say things that might have come from my own mouth. Maugham's narrative voice (I have read none of his other work) has its pros and cons, like anything one cares to name, and although at times a bit tedious \\"I must interrupt myself to make it plain that I am not attempting here to give anything in the nature of a description of the philosophical system known as Vedanta...\\" it was never a great distraction. Characters in a well-written book (and Maugham is himself one here) have their own peculiar ways of speaking, like it or not. It is clear to the reader now, 60 years after the writing of the book, that Maugham comes from his time and place. Deal with it.<br /><br />What makes the book interesting are the variety of themes: love and romance, what is important and unimportant in life, spirituality and mysticism... The main draw is Larry, as was intended, but - except for Elliot in my case - the reader also cares about and is interested in the other major characters. Larry is not only unusual, but mysterious. His cool aloofness, combined with his goodness, makes one wonder what he's up to. Realizing how insignificant the opinions of others are, he doesn't care what people think about him, but the reader certainly can't help thinking about him. I found the character of Elliot less interesting than his page count called for; to me, his life was, as the narrator describes it, silly and useless, so I had to be patient at times when he was center stage.<br /><br />One thing I found Maugham did quite well is to be fair to his characters. Take Larry: when Larry finally discusses his wanderings and his search for meaning, although Maugham disagrees with much of what he says (as he also does with certain ways or opinions of other of his characters) he does not stack the deck or create a straw man by representing Larry's point of view poorly, and his own well, ensuring his own opinion to be the \\"winner.\\" In fact, I read Larry's story and found fault with many of the narrator's own objections and comments. In most cases, writers aren't able to be so honest as Maugham has been here.<br /><br />Maugham wasn't perfect, as is no one. He does use \\"sweet\\" to describe Larry more than a few times, but that is not the extent of his descriptive phraseology for him at all. And after describing Isabel early on in chapter 6 at some length, he ruins his own efforts with a clumsy and needless summation \\"She was in short sexually a very attractive young woman.\\" However, I prefer to recognize such things in their proper context: every piece of art that one cares to name, no matter whether it is a book, a painting or a piece of music, is likely to be the favorite of one person and the most hated of another. Looking at the book as a whole, if you like it you can't fault it too much for what are in your opinion only minor errors after all. Readers should not make the mistake of reading as editors. The job of the editor is to be picky so that the publisher can say that someone made the effort. The job of the reader of a novel is, at the very least, like that of a good dancer paired with another of lesser skill: to attempt to lead the book in a way so that one enjoys the read as best one can.<br /><br />On the idea that \\"there was no plot\\" in the book, or that it was \\"only peripherally about Larry's search for meaning\\": Many readers make the mistake of thinking that the point of reading novels is simply to find out what happens. \\"What's it about?\\" they want to know, as if it were as easy as asking for directions to the nearest McDonalds. What about subtlety? Even a literature student should appreciate that. Even so, Maugham has written a book that does, in fact, feature a plot, which is the unfolding mystery of the events of and surrounding Larry's adult life. That some elements are closer to and some farther from his life doesn't mean that Maugham has just offered a \\"snapshot\\" of life with no point or direction. Perhaps the comment from another reader is simply the result of having read too many simple books that are nothing more than paper television.
0375410341|4.0|Ignore the four stars.  I don't know how to rate this book. I finished it and put it down a week ago, and it still hasn't put me down. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I can't say I was spooked by the spooky parts, but it keeps echoing and reverberating and suggesting new ways of looking at itself. A single review can hardly scratch the surface.<br />Ostensibly it's \\"about\\" an orphaned California slacker named Johnny Truant, who discovers a trunkful of notes in the apartment of a blind, ominously dead recluse named Zampano. The notes are for a commentary on a film documentary called The Navidson Record. The documentary records photojournalist Will Navidson's attempts to explore an expandable, collapsible, freakily infinite hallway that appears in his suburban Virginia home. Navidson's *h*o*u*s*e* (read that as blue text, please) is a heart of darkness, terrifying in its otherness, its vast inexplicability, its emptiness, its death-in-life.  <br />Truant soon discovers that the *h*o*u*s*e*, the documentary, and Navidson himself don't seem to exist in (his and the novel's) real world. But as he obsesses over the notes and the horrors they examine, he finds his own reality, or his own mind, disintegrating into ash. His breakdown leads to a nightmarish and quite likely spurious denoument, and finally to the publication by Johnny's faceless editors of the book before us.<br />All this, including the details of Navidson's polar expeditions into inner space, reads along quite naturally, even though the book sends you hopping from text to footnote to spiralling footnotes nested several levels deep, and through typographic games that sometimes make the reader feel like he's attending a taffy pull, starring as the taffy. I often found these tricks irritating or boring, but that didn't mean I was ever capable of laying the book aside.<br />If the prose style - actually the two prose styles, the self dramatizing, sometimes slangy and sometimes lushly lyrical, voice of JohhnyTruant, and the dryly academic semiotician's voice of Zampano, with its dryly sardonic footnotes mocking every convention of \\"critical theory\\" - is nothing to write home about, it's always appropriate to the character delivering it. The massive display of erudition (Danielewski has not merely read Heidegger and Derrida, he has them thoroughly scoped out, and builds their ideas deeply into the warp and woof of his novel) is bound to strike some readers as dreary showing off. But he doesn't just drop names. He makes use of them: he makes his Latin tags and mythological allusions and postmodern cliches bounce off one another, enlarging alarmingly the mental space inhabited by the text. There must be a hundred different ways to think about Danielewski's artifact, a hundred paths into the labyrinth, and at every turning he generously sets up signposts to help willing readers get lost among them.<br />To follow one main clew: \\"*H*o*u*s*e* of Leaves\\" is a book about text, and how text and reality construct one another. The climax of each of the two main stories (and it just may take many readings to figure out how many other stories are camouflaged within them) involves an act of book burning. At the very center of Navidson's life is a still photo, one which won him a Pulitzer Prize - and though Navidson is fictional, the photo and its Pulitzer are real. At the center of Truant's obsessions is a mental movie of the moment a labyrinth of scars was traced across his chest and arms, making a text of his body. So notes of anonymous \\"editors\\" wrap around Truant's notes, which wrap around Zampano's notes, which wrap around Zampano's text, which wraps around Navidson's documentary, which wraps around a devastating photograph that really exists in the real reader's world - which wraps around the book. Where in the world or out of it is the center of this elaborate onion?<br />At one point in the documentary, Navidson speculates that the *h*o*u*s*e* is God. Danielewski isn't explicit, but that offhand remark is probably meant to call to mind the classic image of God in American literature, the fearful blankness, the whiteness, of Ahab's whale. Nicolas of Cusa once defined God as \\"a circle whose center is everywhere and whose circumference is nowhere.\\" In this volume, Danielewski has attempted to construct a circularly layered piece of literature which meets those specifications. And I can't swear that he hasn't succeeded. <br />Once you've followed the twists and turns of all the unheimlich maneuvers in \\"*H*o*u*s*e* of Leaves\\", where will you come out? Probably not where I did. As a work of literature, it may be worth anything from two stars to six. But as a work of echoing acoustic architecture, I'd have to say it's without parallel.
B00006AG5N|5.0|&quot;ELV1S 30 #1 Hits&quot; is one of those CDs which really doesn't require sound samples. Instead of buying a bunch of old CDs which are poor compilations of great songs and weak songs, we get Elvis' best stuff.<br />My favorites are here: In the Ghetto, Crying in the Chapel, Burning Love, Heartbreak Hotel.<br />This a terrific album to play in the car while driving down Rt. 66, or to the mall, or to pop in during a party.<br />I don't know what the reason is for the substitute songs. Maybe a contractual thing?<br />Elvis has stood the test of time, and this is a very worthy addition to any fan of 50s and 60s music. Why did RCA wait this long?<br />I fully recommend &quot;ELV1S 30 #1 Hits.&quot; Pick up some Chuck Berry while you're at it.<br />Anthony Trendl
B00006J3WH|4.0|If you like the TV show, \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer,\\" then you'll LOVE this CD - the classic musical episode from the 2001-2002 season.<br />The songs range from ultra-campy, i.e. Anya's \\"Theory\\" that bunny-rabbits are the root of all evil (\\"...and what's with all the carrots - what do they need such good eye-sight for anyway?!\\"), to romantic, i.e. Tara's stunningly pristine love song, \\"Under Your Spell\\" (which could be a genuine hit if radio were actually cool), to rockin', i.e. \\"Rest in Peace,\\" Spike's kiss-off to Buffy (\\"...stop visiting my grave!\\").<br />But the real hoot is hearing the cast members voices:  Tara, Anya and Giles are truly amazing; Buffy, Spike and Xander are surprisingly good; and Willow... well, she tries her best.  But what really sells the whole thing is their sheer convition and emotion, hence the title:  \\"Once More, with Feeling.\\"<br />The last few tracks are ochrestral scores from previous episodes, and they are epic:  scary, serene, and suspensful - often within the same piece.<br />Absolutely worth buying if you're a Buffy fan... and even if you're not!
B0000668IF|2.0|I bought this CD right when it came out and I was very disappointed.  This is, in fact, Play Part 2.  There is nothing fresh here and the played out melodies heard on &quot;Play&quot; get quite old here.  This album may work for those of you who haven't heard the critically acclaimed &quot;Play&quot; because it takes the same formula and basically kills it when comparing the two albums.  The first single &quot;We Are All Made of Stars&quot; does budge and it does work on certain levels, but it isn't anything to rave about.  The appearance of Sinead O'Connor on another track on the album isn't that magnificent either.  My recommendation is to definately get &quot;Play&quot; (if you don't already have it) and forget that this CD was ever made.
B0000542D2|5.0|I agree with other reviewers that the DVD packaging leaves a bit to be desired (at least why not a more durable plastic slipcase?).  Except for that minor gripe, this is a highly recommended ultimate version of a classic movie.  Although of course there is a storyline, A HARD DAY'S NIGHT plays more like an irreverent, art-exaggerates-life documentary, balancing timeless music with fast-paced, witty off-stage interplay that hasn't grown stale with the passage of decades.<br />I noticed that the 5.1 mix is used only for the music; the dialogue portions are center-speaker only (the audio transitions are smooth, though).  I suppose some will quibble that because of this you are no longer watching the original theatrical release, but it adds dramatic effect to go from mono to 5.1 for the music, so I'd consider it an improvement.  There is an excellent documentary to fill out disc one; disc two is full of interviews--albeit not with any Beatles--that provide interesting anecdotes, but will probably not warrant many repeat viewings except by Beatle fans (but since you are getting two DVDs for the price of one, think of it as a free bonus disc).
B00006JSGQ|4.0|.....stands it's own among the current crop. My favourite song is 'Devil Baby'. Sounds something off a Nick Drake album, except ofcourse for the extra instruments.
B00003CXC6|5.0|Rashomon is quite simply an amazing piece of filmmaking. Kurosawa was nothing less than a master at his craft. At a technical viewpoint it is an amazing film, the same story is told in 4 different ways by 4 different characters, each of them trying to paint themselves in the best possible light. The camerawork is also amazing, notice for example the shots when a character is walking through the woods in the beginning, there is no dialogue, the sequence is long, there are amazing shots of the sun through the trees, the camera movement is flawless. Notice also how he plants his camera in the prison sequences, a la 'Ozu' (low level steadishots) and how the camera can barely stay still in the woods sequences. The beginning of the film in the apocalyptic storm is overpowering in its effect. The dialogue and acting are also pitchperfect. Notice how actors in Kurosawa films always seem to be screaming their dialogue or laughing in an over the top manner, Kurosawa wasn't aiming for realism (like Ozu does), he's out to make a point and he does it so well, that it shows in how well his films have crossed over to western audiences. This is the first japanese film that was widely seen by american audiences and won the academy award for foreign film, not to mention introducing the great Toshiro Mifune to cinema and beginning arguably the best filmmaking pair ever (not counting Scorsese/DeNiro) with Kurosawa/Mifune, which would go on and make lots of films together. Also the tremendous impact this film has had on the film infustry alone is enough to consider it a classic. Even so, it's ability to move audiences of all nationalities and through the decades, speaks very well of how Kurosawa handled his themes. In it's 90 min. of running time, this film tells you more about human nature than most any film will, it has all the richness that reading a good book might give you, and it is cinematically amazing. If you like this film, I recommend 'Seven Samurai' for Kurosawa or 'Tokyo Story' for more great Japanese cinema. A solid 9.8 out of 10!
B00004I9VE|5.0|One of the top-selling albums of all time with a slew of top 40 hits, &quot;Thriller&quot; made a huge impact on the recording industry.  This SACD version shows impeccable sound with surprising warmth.  The big discovery is that almost all of the instruments are digital, something which is very clear on all the cuts...there is a very distinctive digital 'sound'.  Yet this is still a very well-recorded album (most probably thanks to production by Quincy Jones) and every song is a delight.  Fans of acoustic/natural instruments may actually be disappointed by the overwhelming digital character, but the impressive orchestrations and overall powerful sound has never been better.  <br />My usual experience in having better quality recordings of older music is that I notice the inherent flaws of the original recordings more clearly (along with better clarity), but in every SACD I have listened to so far, I am blown away by just how well-recorded the music was, how musical it actually is...even now.  The same goes for &quot;Thriller&quot;.
B00006F7S4|3.0|First of all I'm making clear that i give this album only 3 stars being fully aware that it's one of those albums that you cant objectively rate..Someone else might give 5 stars and it would be perfectly reasonable.<BR>    The fact that Beck appears with a different, melancholic persona in &quot;Sea change&quot; isn't really all that surprising.<BR>    Beck fans know very well that almost all of Beck's LPs have been very diverse and quite different from each other.<BR>    Now, when it comes to this, to me at least, it was a pleasant surprise. Beck proves that he can deliver a &quot;downer&quot; the way it should be delivered. There's tons of melancholy and sadness here, and Beck gives some beautiful performances, as he goes through a streak of heavily emotional ballads.<BR>   &quot;Lost cause&quot; the 5th track is a tremendous song as is the very first one &quot;Golden age&quot;...<BR>    And while anyone being in the same mood as the famous sample-trickster will be very well served here, others might see it differently.<BR>   I personally liked the album a lot, but, as i was listening to it i thought it started &quot;dragging&quot; towards the last songs, the last 3-4 tracks started &quot;dissapearing&quot; music-wise as they had not much musical inspiration.<BR>    Yes the lyrics are for the most part ranging from great to decent but the mood is repetitive and this hurts the album.<BR>    &quot;Sea change&quot; will please the Beck loyal...Others, who might be only discovering Beck now, might find this boring.<BR>    And interestingly, noone might be wrong..
B000003S09|5.0|this may be one of the best cd,s of it,s kind if you get sick of all the stuff you hear every day on your radio put this cd on sit back and relax !
0793509602|5.0|Once again, Troy Stetina has written an awsome guitar book. Metal Lead Guitar skips the small stuff that most guitarists already know and goes straight to the techniques you need! And, this is the first book that I have seen with a section for learning to use the wammy bar! This book is slightly challenging, so I do not reccommend this if you are new to guitar, but if you have the basics down and hopefully a little more, BUY THIS BOOK! You will fall in love with it!
0316666343|4.0|Alice Sebold's talent shines through in &quot;The Lovely Bones.&quot; Susie's voice is powerful. Her version of heaven allows readers to visualize the journey of our souls in the after-life. The various characters in the story are people we can easily identify with. Each family member dealt with the tragedy differently, and the author did an excellent job detailing their emotions. My only gripe has to do with Susie's reunion with Ray. The technique seemed right out of the movie &quot;Ghost,&quot; with Susie in the role of Sam (Patrick Swayze).<br />Bill Lee, author (&quot;Chinese Playground&quot;)
6300216039|3.0|I will say that this is the best cinematic rendition of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; that I have seen.  It does little, if any, justice to Shakespeare, however.  A number of lines and even scenes have been cut, scenes which gave the story its true depth (for example, when we are first introduced to Romeo in the play, he is weeping and lamenting his lost love Rosaline; in the movie he only provides some brief thoughts on love, with no particular despair).  This is only a superficial story of love, worthy of more comparison to &quot;Titanic&quot; than to Shakespeare's masterpiece.  The acting is fair to good, the scenery is marvelous, but the editing of the script (and Zeffirelli's poor interpretation) leave little to comtemplation.  Shakespeare's play is not some simplistic, sappy tale of tragic love; it is a multi-layered study in life, providing us with great insights and truths.  If you want the best movie version, then buy this one, but if you want to know what &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; is really all about, attend a live, full-length performance (or at least read the play itself).
B00004RFFS|4.0|Compaired with Queen of the Damned (2001), Interview is certainly a far superior representation of Anne Rice's brilliant creation. This movie follows the novel fairly well. A few details have been changed as with any interputation of a book. For example the ending is more &quot;Hollywoood&quot;. Casting was good with the exception of a slight age problem having Antonio Banderas play the eternal 17-year old, Armand. Tom Cruise did a decent job of bringing Lestat &quot;to life&quot;. Overall I think most Rice fans will be pretty satisfied with this movie.

B000068TSI|5.0|We Were Soldiers released in 2002 is based on the factual events that occurred in Vietnam in 1965.  The writer/director Randall Wallace captures all sides of war in this movie.  Mel Gibson portrays Lt. Colonel Hal Moore who is in charge of 395 U.S. Air Calvary men who are being shipped to Vietnam.  He is the leader of the 7th Calvary, the same Calvary number as Custard.  Madeline Stowe plays his wife who has to face her own challenges while he is out to war.  This film is based in Vietnam where these men are involved in a new type of war involving helicopters.   It illustrates what the U.S. Air Calvary, the Vietnamese Army, and what these soldiers' wives are going through during this battle.  This movie shows Lt. Colonel Hal Moore as a father figure who has much religious faith. <br />The U.S. Air Calvary must go against all odds of being outnumbered by the Vietnam soldiers.  This movie was very intense and focused as much on the individuals in the battle as the battle itself.  It portrays the courage that all of these characters had.  Madeline Stowe had the horrendous task of informing the soldiers' wives of their death.  She knew that her own telegram could be coming, but she still went on day after day delivering them.  This movie even had a group of men lost, against all odds they found ways to survive surrounded by enemies.  <br />This movie was very graphic and would not be recommended for young viewers.  It would make any person want to go out and join the army.  These soldiers were faced with many odds and like many times the government doesn't want to let on how intense things really were over there when this battle was happening.
0345440900|4.0|This book had many helpful topics and advice that is usually hard to find. Tracy answered many questions I had and taught me how to really listen to my childs cries. I learned through a very FLEXIBLE schedule what my child needed, and he in return knew what to expect: nap, feed, or wake. He is now 8 months old and a very happy little boy. It was very helpful! However, as with many books, you may not agree to everything she offers. Take the advice that applies to you and your family and leave the rest. I've noticed some readers who take these books to heart, word for word (OWENSMAMMA in particular) and I would advise to never do that in any area of your own life. I read in OWENSMAMMA's reviews that she did not like any of the more popular books on baby rearing. That is her perogotive. However, you could be a little nicer towards people who do not raise your children in the same manner as you. We do not feel sorry for your children. We do not put your techniques down. These books are not evil, they are intended to use as a guide, not a bible. Take it with a grain of salt.
0201633612|5.0|Design Patterns<BR>This book is a classic computer science text. This is probably the one computer book that every computer programmer and software developer should read. It will definately have an immediate impact on the code you write. Unlike most computer books, which have a shelf measured in months, this book has lasted the test of time, and will likely be relavent for many years. (At least as long as object-oriented programming languages are used!)<BR>This book uses C++ and Smalltalk to code the examples, but don't worry about that. There are plenty of books that are basically &quot;rewrites&quot; of this book using Java or other langauges, but it doesn't matter what language your programming. I recommend this book over any other patterns book because these guys invented the subject. The patters can be programmed in any language, and you don't have to be a C++ or Smalltalk expert to understand them.

I wanted to see some peace out of this situation and saw none.<BR>Good read but not Great. Salute.

B00006AG5N|5.0|Well, it's finally here -- the ultimate Elvis greatest hits collection.  And it has something for everyone.  For longtime Elvis fans who already have most or all of the songs on this album, the remastering on this CD makes the songs sound brand-new, fuller, fresher and much more vibrant.  For new fans of the King there could be no better place to start with his music than &quot;30 #1 Hits&quot;.  They're all here -- &quot;Hound Dog&quot;, &quot;Suspicious Minds&quot;, &quot;Don't Be Cruel&quot;, &quot;Love Me Tender&quot;, and even the new worldwide #1 smash remix by JXL, &quot;A Little Less Conversation&quot;.  This is the ultimate greatest hits package by the best-selling musical artist of all time.  Whether you are a long-time fan of the King or someone just getting into his music, you owe it to yourself to get this CD.  It's like getting three whole discs for the price of one -- 31 great songs, and ALL of them #1 hits.  Yes, folks, Elvis is back in the building, and this new CD is proof that the #1 ARTIST OF THE 20TH CENTURY will still be THE MAN well into the 21st.
B000065U1N|5.0|This is by far one of my favorite movies of all time.  This movie depicts things that alot of people really don't know all that much about.   I remember I was 12 when this happened, so when it came out in theaters that was a first for me.  I thought this movie displayed the courage and honor that these men had for themselves, the man next to them and their country.   I think the most moving part of the whole scene was when Ryan Shughart and Gary Gordan - The two Delta Force snipers that went down by themselves to try and save Mike Durant.  These two men went down to try to save him by themselves, knowing they were going to die.  I can't imagine what that must have felt like.  Knowing that you were going to leave your wife and children behind to try and save the man next to you.  I would like to believe that I would be able to do the same - know I was going to die and do it anyways.  That will be burned in my brain forever.  I don't know what else I can say about this movie.  It is scary to watch a movie like this and know that what I am watching really happened.  But I feel I have been honored to bare witness to what really happened in Somali that day.

B000063S6Z|5.0|Moby has changed so much from his early techno, and yet remains the same. Both of which are fortunate for music fans. 18, more mellow and subdued than his previous album, Play, continues Moby's musical expansion across various genres. Only one song, &quot;Jam for the Ladies,&quot; comes close to his 'bodyrock' grooves that dominate his earlier music, but don't think that he has abandoned techno beats. This album alternates between steady-beat, instrumentalized songs with minimal vocals (the majority, in fact) to full lyrical songs like &quot;We Are All Made of Stars,&quot; with a few purely instrumental, sweet songs like &quot;18.&quot; Moby brings in several guest singers to this album, especially female, and employs gospel or blues-like lyrical lines into the majority of songs, such as &quot;In This World&quot; and &quot;One of These Mornings.&quot; My personal fav's include &quot;We Are All Made of Stars,&quot; &quot;Extreme Ways,&quot; and &quot;Signs of Love&quot;; another standout song is the purely vocal &quot;Great Escape.&quot;<br />The entire album works very well together, progressing from song to song in a dreamy lanscape reminiscent of the cover art. Those expecting a high-tempo, lively album must be aware of this, and be warned that with this mentality some of the songs may start to blend together in a sort of mush. However, those who prefer Moby's later music, and enjoyed Play, will probably also enjoy this album, although of course I can't gaurantee this. If you're new to Moby, I highly recommend this album, but might first suggest Play to get a wider variety of tempos and styles. Still, 18 succeeds in giving Moby another boost in his musical career, and remains one of my favorite albums.

078401213X|5.0|Pi was what a film should be...inspiring. Pi is a cinematic blend of philosophy, mathematics, and humanity, that leaves its viewer questioning everything. I read several reviews that said things like, `A man searching for Pi, how boring.' or, `...too repetitive.' Obviously these reviewers missed the point. Pi is not simply about a man looking for a number, it is about a man looking for the key to the universe. I have always been interested in chaos theory, and when I read the full title of this film (Pi: Faith In Chaos) I was eager to watch it. It did not disappoint.

B000067G3C|4.0|SPEED    (USA - 1994)    Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)  Theatrical soundtracks: Dolby Digital / DTS    That rarity in modern American cinema - a high concept bubblegum movie which lives up to its own hype and doesn't insult the audience's intelligence - the film offers a three-act scenario (elevator, bus and subway) in which a ruthless terrorist (Dennis Hopper) pits his considerable bomb-making skills against the local SWAT team's finest agents, led by a pumped-up Keanu Reeves (whose career was subsequently launched into orbit, reaching iconic status in the ultra-popular MATRIX series). In one of the commentaries provided for the DVD version, producer Mark Gordon (SAVING PRIVATE RYAN) and writer Graham Yost (BROKEN ARROW) cheerfully acknowledge the film's one-dimensional characters and obvious plot-holes whilst celebrating the ultra-slick production values and breathtaking action sequences.     And it IS slick: Debut director Jan de Bont (an erstwhile cinematographer, usually associated with Paul Verhoeven) has marshalled a note-perfect creative team on both sides of the camera, turning Yost's modest screenplay into a super-charged thrill-machine, photographed (by Andrzej Bartkowiak) and edited (by John Wright) to perfection, and augmented by some of the best stuntwork and visual effects that money can buy. The cast is dependable and solid: Reeves and Hopper make a formidable virtue of their opposing characters, and leading lady Sandra Bullock 'makes cute' in a career-making performance, while Jeff Daniels (DUMB & DUMBER) and Joe Morton (THE BROTHER FROM ANOTHER PLANET) offer strong support in crucial secondary roles.     NB. To date, no one involved in the production has addressed the narrative parallels between SPEED and the Japanese thriller THE BULLET TRAIN (1975), in which a terrorist bomb is primed to explode on board a packed commuter train if it falls below a certain speed. It's possible that SPEED was written and produced in complete ignorance of theearlier film, but the two scenarios share uncomfortable similarities.
B000066NW0|4.0|Sure the artist herself may have received a lot of backlash but that doesn't stop me from liking her music. If you liked Michelle Branch and Venessa Carlton you will most likely love this! If that wasn't enough she plays the guitar on her songs and \\"co-writes\\" them as it says in the CD. Go Avril .
B00000K19E|5.0|The matrix is definitely one the of the best movies I have ever seen.  The action was amazing, the plot magnificent, and the characters were well suited to their parts and their acting was stupendous.  However there is a lot more to this movie than meets the eye.<BR>Several days ago when I was watching the movie I was surprised how the story-line of the movie parallels that of the bible.  First of all is Neo who would resemble Jesus.  Neo is born in the fake world,  is \\"re-born\\" by 'morpheus', and through his death and resurrection is able to overcome the matrix and defeat the AGENTS(the devil) finalize what he is.  Morpheus is like John the Baptist who is in a sense \\"preparing the way for the ONE\\".  Another similarity I found was the old matrix and EDEN.  The old matrix was a perfect place but humans rejected it and were then forced to work and toil for the rest of their lives in misery and pain.  I think it is also ironic how Neo kills the main AGENT in the end of the movie.  The agent dies with his arms spread out in mockery of Jesus on the cross.  <BR>I've heard of many other parallels within Christianity and many other religions as well.  It just makes you wonder if it was all a giant fluke or if the producer and storywriters of the matrix had something deeper in mind. Just keep that in mind the next time you watch it.  Maybe you'll find some other parallels as well.

1400031354|5.0|Two people review:<br />Hers -  This is my first McCall Smith book, and I have hurriedly gone out and bought the other two of the series focusing on The Number 1 Ladies' Detective Agency.  The reason is simple: this was a wonderful book!  It is entertaining, charming, enlightnening.  It taught me lots about customs and manners of Botswana. It described the climate, the flora, the preoccupations of common, regular people. And it reminded me of the universality of human experiences.  All of this with a good sense of humor.  I don't remember another book in the recent past that delighted me to the extent of a perpetual smile while in the process of reading. Five stars and fireworks! <br />His--This reminded me forcibly of Tony Hillerman's gentle detective stories, in which his hero has to negotiate between local and ancient customs and the newer and more aggressive manners of the prevailing society in the US.  The formal narrative voice and the formal manner of treating persons both announce that the human creature is to be honored and revered, even if he is slightly disreputable.  The emphasis upon morality and ethics in the detective trade is refreshing for those jaded by the commercially driven culture which reveres the bottom line. The entire novel, with its apparently naive point of view about those norms taken for granted in the Northern hemisphere, seems refreshing in its innocence and its enduring wisdom.  I loved it!
B00000K19E|5.0|I watched the Matrix and found some really interesting parallels between the Matrix and some of the stories in the bible.  I'm not saying the Matrix is a Christian movie but I had some important scenes in it that were very close to what happened in the bible.  Such as, the ones that I found most amazing were how Neo is like Jesus.  Throughout the movie he was referred to as \\"the one\\" and he had come to \\"save\\" the world.  In the beginning one of the characters actually said, \\"You're my savior, my own personal Jesus Christ\\".  What I found really interesting was how Neo had gotten shot but came back to life and saw the world in such different eyes, it was the same when Jesus dies on the cross and he had also came back to life when he had risen.  Maybe this is all a coincident but the movie parallels with other people in the bible as well. Such as Morpheus is like John the Baptist, they both have come to prepare the way for the messiah which is Neo/Jesus.  They were both mistaken as to being the actual saviors but they insisted that \\"the on\\" will be so much better and be able to do things you couldn't imagine!  This movie got me thinking about things that I never would when watching this type of movie.  It was excellent, and even though people interpret it differently, for me it was the above and for others it may be the action, with or without my interpretation it was an awesome movie!
0140143505|5.0|Two people review:<br />HERS: This is a nostalgic book, set in most part during the years immediately following WWII. It is also an epistolary documentary. In the 20+ years of correspondence between a New Yorker and an English book seller an entire portait of an era is depicted. Not only the small details of daily rationings in England, or the American's employment ups and downs; but also the manners and restrained etiquette of years past. Below the surface of these formal letters, outwardly dealing with the passion for books is an underlying void of words never written but well inderstood: a platonic love affair among people who care for books. The personalities and values of the letter writers is marvelously displayed through innuendos, reticences, outright indignation, passion and despair more often than not only alluded to. It is a masterful portrait of an era, of a relationship and of the art of letter wrting!<br />HIS: Perfectly delightful, every page. It all works because of understatement, warranted by an assumed relationship through the love of books. So what doesn't get said doesn't need to be said, for people of like minds. Like lovers. Yet the two correspondents never met.
B00000K19E|5.0|In the film the Matrix, there is an amazing amount of parallels between this film and the story of Jesus in the Bible.  The most obvious is that Neo represents Jesus.  There are many things that happen to Neo that are similar to events that happend to Jesus.  The first is that when Neo is rescued from the Matrix and he is in a membrane filled with water, similar to the womb that a baby spends the first 9 months of its life in.  The action of Neo breaking out and sliding down a tube into the 'real world' is similar to a baby being born, which represents the spiritual rebirth of a person when the accept Christ as their personal Lord and Saviour.  Another event that parallels Jesus' training in the desert, being tempted by Satan is Neo's training against Morpheus in the kung-fu program, preparing the One to do His job.  Two other events that parallel occurances in Jesus' life happen near the end of the film, where Neo is shot and killed but then resurrected by the love of Trinity, just as the Trinity's love brings Jesus back from the dead.  The final one is right at the end of the movie, when Neo flies up into the air.  This is similar to JEsus' ascension into Heaven, and the beginning of the new way of life for Christians.  Other characters that parallel Bible characters are: Morpheus, who represents John the Baptist in that He is preparing the way for the One; Cypher, who, like Judas the betrayer, betrays the Saviour to the enemy; and the Oracle, who can represent any of the prophets from the Old Testament who foretold Jesus' coming.  I think that anyone who enjoys this film, Christian or not, should read the gospels in the Bible just so they can see the amazing amount of similarities between the two very different stories.
B00005JKLZ|2.0|Bad movie, weak plot, lots of plot inconsistencies. Very poorly done. The original was much better. This DVD is not a keeper.
B00005YW4H|5.0|My boyfriend brought this CD over for me to listen to.  Now I'm going to have to get my own copy because he wants it back.<br />I brought it to work have been listening to it for two days straight.  With most CD's I fast forward to my favorite songs and skip the rest.  I can't do that with this one.  I love them all!  I am an instant fan and can't wait for Norah's next creation.
B00006J3WH|4.0|If you've already seen the episode that this soundtrack represents, then you already know it's excellent. Stop dithering, and buy it.<br />If you're not already familiar, this is better than you think. Much better, in fact. It's more of Andrew Lloyd Weber type of production, and should appeal to fans of &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot; or &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;. <br />Anthony Stewart Head, James Marsters, and Amber Benson all have featured songs, as does guest star, Hinton Battle. They are all excellent, and their songs are representative of their skills. The rest of the cast provide solid performances. In particular, Sarah Michelle Gellar shows considerably more musical talent than you'd expect.<br />My only gripe is that these are studio recordings, without any of the overlapping dialogue. Whereas that greatly improves &quot;The Parking Ticket&quot; and &quot;Where Do We Go From Here?&quot;, it does take something from &quot;Going through the Motions&quot;. The largest disappointment comes in the form &quot;What You Feel&quot;, where some vital, and very entertaining dialogue is omitted. Hearing this without Michelle &quot;Dawn&quot; Trachtenberg's adorable litlle &quot;Yeah-huh&quot;, is like listening to Sinatra's version of &quot;Send in the Clowns&quot; without his poignant introduction.

0316666343|5.0|This is a great story. Totally different from what I usually read. Held my interest until I finished in 1 day. It's an easy read, spellbinding.
6304712936|5.0|First off, to really appreciate this version of &quot;Amadeus&quot;, it must be kept in mind that this was actually the original cut of &quot;Amadeus&quot;. If you don't believe me, ask Roger Ebert.<br />With that in mind, it is easy to set this film apart from other directors cuts, because you are seeing an original vision, not one created for profit. And not to fix any problems. It's simply another way to look at the material. It stands next to it's original version as an equal, not to replace it. <br />This version is terrific. It's a little darker, a little longer, and somewhat more complex. Though not for the family, adults and older teens will no doubt enjoy the added complexity of the film.<br />If this version had been released in 1984, it's a wonder if the film would reach the same audience it did back then. It's more the same than it is different, but I don't think it would have been as universal. Still, it's great to see a different light on a firmiliar face, and it's a grand old film. Not flawed in any way.
B00006DEF9|4.0|The undisputed, best musical of all time with a boyishly charming Gene Kelly at the helm. With witty banter, romance in Gene's eye and a playful Donald Olsen, there isn't much not to love about this classic MGM film. <br />The only reason I hesitated to buy this special edition was because I already had the last DVD version which is a fairly clean print. The new 2002 restoration is even more gorgeous and one really has to squint to catch any remaining specks. I haven't had a chance to compare the two DVD versions in detail, but the special edition also seems to make the hues much richer and brighter.<br />As for the extras, well, the documentaries tell the film's backstory and it's neat to see clips from movies where the Arthur Freed songs were originally used. The one with Bing Crosby, for example, is quite amusing. I would have liked to see more outtakes and scenes that hit the cutting room floor. There must be more than the one they included of Debbie Reynolds singing 'You Are My Lucky Star.' Also, with so many different interviews stitched together, the audio commentary track leaves something to be desired. While it's nice to hear from the likes of Cyd Charisse, Debbie Reynolds, Don Olsen, Co-Director Stanley Donen and the scriptwriters, it's a little disconcerting too, because it's evident they were all recorded separately. Sometimes the commentary doesn't match up with the scenes, as would be the case if only the director were commenting, for example.  Also, rather than hear others talk about Debbie Reynolds' struggles as a novice dancer on the film, it would have been more appropriate to hear Reynolds herself on the audio track commenting on Gene Kelly's reputation as a task master and her difficulties learning the dances. <br />All in all, Warner Brothers added lots of extras for the special 50th anniversary edition and were careful to explain many of the allusions to previous films made within the movie. Gene Kelly would probably be happy that one of his signature films has endured time so well. If you haven't seen it yet, I also recommend that 'Anatomy of a Dancer' documentary that PBS did on Gene. It's pretty comprehensive and it's a fun look at his life.
0553106635|5.0|Martin's style of writing and descriptivness make you feel as if you're in the book beside the characters. He makes you love the caharacters and care for them, or hate them bitterly. Definetly one of the best. Words can not form the anticipation of the fourth installment, A Feast for crows. <BR>Being merely 13 years of age it was hard to keep up with the wide quantity and style of characters... surely my elders faced the same difficulty.. but it adds to the effectiveness. This story is based on a history so rich and people so different it almost seems that Westeros (the main land in the A song of Ice and Fire series) is an actual peice of land on Earth. <BR>I'd have to say I like the characters Sansa, Arya, Sandor and Brienne... mostly because they're having conflicts with themselves and the outcome is so inevitable and fruitful you'll cheer for them or even cry. Some aren't so positive about Sansa and ponder if she'll ever become wise but I like her because I pity her yet am like her... she is interesting and probably Martin's formation of the &quot;average, fairy-tale blinded little girl&quot; but his addition of a charater of such being was a wise choice. Then there's Arya, the rebel who shows a side of compassion.. she in that way is like me as well.. I'd say I'm composed of the parts of Sansa and Arya who are so different yet alike... And then there's Brienne of Tarth who's ending may be what she least expects.. And my all-time favourite male Sandor Clegane AKA the hound. Nobody understands him and underneath his cover he wants the same as every decent person; to be loved. <BR>I highly recommend this book to any fantasy-lover like myself... the tragedies and commotions are the perfect ingredients that conjur up a romance/adventure/action book that sits atop the high shelf of the greatest fantasy books....

B00003CXAE|4.0|Grease was probably one of the last significant live action musicals.  Despite the recent success of Moulin Rouge, there is little to suggest that this genre will be making any sort of comeback.  Whatever the factors that killed the musical, Grease was not one of them:  this was a fun movie when it came out and continues to be fun nowadays.  (My guess is that that other late seventies musical, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, bears a greater responsibility for the faltering of the genre.)<br />Like any musical, success at first hinges on the music, and this one has some great tunes.  Secondly, however, it must have a good story, and this one, simple as it is, suffices:  the tale of Danny and Sandy, two high-school students in love despite their obvious differences, is just enough to keep things moving.<br />There are flaws: the flow of time is inconsistent; it seems to take place over a few weeks, but it actually winds up taking a whole school year.  Also, Sandy's transformation in the end from saintly to slutty in an effort to win Danny, while possibly necessary from a plot standpoint, is also more than a little sexist...I don't demand political correctness out of movies, but this \\"lesson\\" does stand out as a bit demeaning.  <br />These are quibbles, however, and overall, this is a good movie. Although I have watched this movie maybe four times, the last time before getting this DVD was maybe twenty years ago.  A couple of decades of life can change a perspective of a film, but I was delighted to see that I still liked this one.
6304510861|5.0|Lost Highway is a great movie. It starts with a saxophone player and he and his wife getting broken into and videotaped while they sleep. This saxaphone player is then arrested for the murder of his wife. In prison he morphes into Pete Dayton, an auto-mechanic who has an affair with a mobster's mistress. That's, more or less, the basic outline.<BR> I loved this movie. It was VERY creepy and totally mindboggling, 2 things typically found in a Lynch film. The 2 things that really stuck with me were the dark, gloomy, shadowy atmosphere, and of course robert blake as the \\"mystery man\\". It also really sticks with you because your constantly thinking about it, trying to contemplate it. The great thing about Lynch is that his films don't have a definitive meaning. He obviously had his own meaning, but your supposed to have your own thoughts and your own interpretation.<BR> All in all, this is a beautiful film. I would strongly reccomend it to any REAL film fan. Very thought-provoking, so go and rent it. NOW!!!!<br />LOST HIGHWAY (1997)<BR>DIRECTED BY DAVID LYNCH<BR>STARRING BILL PULLMAN, PATRICIA ARQUETTE, BALTHAZAR GETTY, AND ROBERT BLAKE<BR>RATED R FOR VIOLENCE, NUDITY, SEXUALITY, AND LANGUAGE
6304712936|5.0|Rather than make a movie about a simple and petty jealousy, Milos Forman has instead made a movie concerned with how a pious man can lose his faith.  How this happens takes the viewer into the world of the eighteenth century and into the mind of Antonio Salieri, as he assumes Mozart to be the incarnation of God in the realm of music.  But if he loves music more than the licentious and disreputable Mozart, what does that say about God?
B00005QZ7U|1.0|One of the most moronic movies I have ever seen.  Actually to be fair, it may have gotten better after the first 20 minutes.   I wouldn't know, because I turned it off at that point.  I just couldn't stomach any more than that.
B00004Y6NP|4.0|One of the strangest twists of fate in music history is the reason as to why this album is remembered.  More often than not associated to its lighter moments - an opinion influenced by hit singles &quot;Money For Nothing&quot; and &quot;Walk Of Life&quot;.  <br />However, this album is much like its cover's border trim: blue.  Bordering on sombre, it's an album filled with cynicism (&quot;Money For Nothing&quot;) and loneliness (&quot;So Far Away&quot;). <br />In 1985 Dire Straits were at the height of their powers as this album shows.  They had been oft-criticised in the past for their loyalty to their roots but their gutsy determination ensured they didn't give in.  That determination remained with this recording yet high-tech studio wizardry was thrown into the mix and the outcome was one of the finest production jobs to date.  <BR>They also took full advantage of CDs longer time limits and produced longer, fuller songs (the full version of &quot;Money For Nothing&quot; clocks in at over eight minutes).<br />Mark Knopfler really hit his peak during this time too. His guitar work was amazing as were his lyrics and vocals - you can really feel the heartache when he sings &quot;Brother In Arms&quot;. <br />Overall, this is a great album that has become synonymous with an entire generation. Many bands can claim to be the sound of the times, but not of a generation.  With the release of this remarkable LP it was Mark Knopfler 1, Vinyl 0.
B000001E29|5.0|I was always of the opinion that Tom's years at Island Records were his most ingenius (though this year's double release of \\"Alice\\" and \\"Blood Money\\" quite possibly changed all that), and I have always disagreed with the folks (well-intentioned though they may be) that say \\"Bone Machine\\" was the last \\"true\\" Tom Waits album before the release of \\"Mule Variations.\\"  I personally see Tom all over this album.  Granted, I did not have the privelege of actually seeing a stage production of \\"The Black Rider,\\" and the only things I know about the plot I got from the liner notes.  Still, I think something in this play must have touched Tom's soul in a profound way.  To chart this album on the Waits map, I'd put it about halfway between his wild and ambitious late-80s project \\"Franks Wild Years\\" and his just-released tearfully touching opus \\"Alice.\\"  It is, of course, no coincidence that those two albums were also the results of theatric endeavours.  Still, \\"The Black Rider\\" is unique in that the story itself was not a product of Waits's imagination, yet he seems to relate to it almost as if it were.  \\"November,\\" \\"That's the Way,\\" and \\"Briar and the Rose\\" lend touches of real beauty to this album.  \\"Briar and the Rose\\" especially would not seem out of place on \\"Alice,\\" while \\"Just the Right Bullets\\" and \\"Crossroads\\" seem to let you in on what Tom really thinks about the whole mess.  The instrumentals on this are cacophonous even for Waits, which may or may not turn you on, depending on taste.  Of course, no Waits album would be complete without the glitz of the carnival scene making an appearance in some form.  We get this on the opening track, with Tom giving his own rendition of barker patter.  (Real Waits listeners will no doubt notice within this opening track an incarnation of the freak who makes an appearance on \\"Alice\\" as none other than Tabletop Joe.)  All in all, most people will say this album is not for introductory listeners.  I say that depends on what you're looking for in Tom Waits.  If you're looking for his genius in all its freakishly beautiful glory, you'll find few purer concentrations than right here.
B00005U8EM|5.0|The second DVD release of Harold Ramis's GROUNDHOG DAY does justice to such a brilliantly clever comedy taken from a simple yet superb premise. Bill Murray is at his best here, showcasing his perfect comedic timing par excellence. Leaning more towards a rom-com than straight laugh-out-loud comedy, this nontheless is the pinnacle of both Ramis and Murray's career. Nothing else has come close to the wit and genius that pervades every scene throughout the running time. Sarcastic sourpuss weatherman Phil Conners goes to the small town of Punxsutawney to report on the Groundhog festival, and wakes up the next day to Sonny and Cher's &quot;I got you babe&quot;. However he starts to get concerned when everything repeats on itself ad infinitum. The key to the cleverness is that it's never explained how Phil gets stuck in his one-man timewarp, and critics and curios of the film point out that throughout his self-discovery and dispatching numerous clock radios, that it's possible that Phil has been stuck in groundhog day for years. But aside from fascinting ponderings, the film lends itself surprisingly well to the comedic fore. The extent that Phil goes to to woo his weather reporter companion Rita (Andie McDowell) provides some great gags. Screenwriter Danny Rubin's sharp back-and-forth dialouge is another key element to what makes this one of the timeless comedies.<br />The DVD extras are impressive, with the doco &quot;The Weight Of Time&quot; being the highlight, with insightful thoughts from the director and writers. You also get a dry commentary from Harold Ramis, trailers and talent profiles. The DVD digital transfer is top-notch, with sound and picture quality 10 out of 10. A must-buy DVD for Murray and comedy fans alike.
B00006FDCD|4.0|The problem with taking Stephen King out of the pages and translating him to the screen is that so much detail is often lost, costing the viewer the feel that was drawn from the actual novel. That all changes with \\"It\\"! Amazingly enough, a TV mini-series captured the best two facets of the novel: the evil of Pennywise the Clown (won't give away too much here), and the ability of a group of children, who dub themselves \\"The Loser's Club\\", to bond together in friendship with the common purpose of ending a killing machine that's been feasting upon their little Maine town for ages & ages.<br />The best part of this movie was Tim Curry, hands down. He played Pennywise in a campy fashion, but when Pennywise needed to be evil and ghastly....oh, brother, was Curry right on the money. Puts shivers down your spine. This is one that my children avoid at all costs because the nightmares aren't worth it to them.... but YOU'LL love it! Excellent horror story......well presented.

6305433909|1.0|While the content of this movie may indeed by harmless, it is also hopelessly predictable and boring.  I don't think it would have been possible for the producers to have stuffed one more tired-out cliche into this movie.  The only reason I kept watching after the first 1/2 hour was to hear the singing, and in the end I'm sorry I did.  Save two hours of your life and don't bother with this mind-numbing film.

Brigadoon is a town in Scotland that comes to life just once every 100 years.  Gene Kelly and Van Johnson are Jeff and Tommy, hunters who get lost and are looking for some food and a place to stay.  Then they see Brigadoon.  Van Johnson was just hilarious as Jeff, the cynical guy who just can't bring himself to believe that all this craziness is really taking place.  Gene Kelly portrays Tommy, a guy who falls in love with Fiona (brilliantly portrayed by Cyd Charisse).  He has to make a decision at the end of the day, whether he wants to go back to New York and leave Fiona and Brigadoon behind forever, or stay with Fiona and leave New York forever.  A difficult decision for anyone to have to make.  Just a wonderful romance with some beautiful dance routines.  Go to the movie store and buy it.  If you like romance/musicals, you won't be disappointed.
B00006F7S4|2.0|Overall, this is an O.K. effort by Mr. Hansen.  It comes off (after one listening) to be a bit overproduced.  Goodrich is a fan of (heavy) compression and in these beautifully written songs, it wreaks utter havoc (for other examples of this see 'Pavement's Terror Twilight').  This could have been a powerful masterpiece that would stand the test of time.  But unfortunately we are cursed with all the miscellaneous \\"studio bells and whistles\\".  Beck is and will always be a low-fi artist.  Please accept this.
B000069AUI|5.0|After my lukewarm feelings about their first CD, Parachutes, I wasn't too excited about the release of disk#2 from Coldplay.  So I kept in touch with what other Amazon people here were writing about it, and there seemed to be such an overwhelming amount of love for this disk.  So I went to the record store and listed to some of it at the booth...and ended up taking it home!<br />This is one of those disks whose songs are not immediately accessible to you.  Though something about the different songs stick in your mind, and beg you to listen again, and again, and on and on until you find yourself kind of obsessed with the disk.  The charm and beauty come out later on, just as it did with this.<br />This is definately up there for best rock album of 2002; if you're sick of that metal/rap [stuff] on the radio, then check this out.<br />POLITIK draws you in with it's thrashing guitars and almost-hypnotic bridge about 3 minutes into the song; IN MY PLACE is haunting and beautiful that makes you think about love or longing for someone; CLOCKS is immediately lovable and exquisite (again, with a hypnotically beautiful bridge in the midst of the song); GREEN EYES is a hard song to like at first but then it gets deep and lovable; and A RUSH OF BLOOD TO THE HEAD (song) is kinda Jim-Morrison/folkie eerie and dreamy.  Oh and the rest of the songs are fantastic also!<br />This CD will be a turning point of influence to your musical interests for a long time to come...enjoy it!
B00005M91K|5.0|I saw this film in its original 70mm glory before I had any idea what it was.  Not knowing anything about made it all the more spectacular.  All I was told is 'you gotta see it'.<br />It is a symbiosis of sound and sight in a truly unique synthesis.  One without the other leaves one with a sense of absence.  Yet the two together are perfect. Michael Stearns provides a soundscape that buoys music from around the world.  Add to this stunning scenery and fascinating people both at play and at work from around the world and you've got a delight for the senses.  You really do just have to see it.  <br />Personally I have to watch it when I'm alone as most people I know simply think the movie to be a bit odd as it is not your traditional 'movie'.  Yet it is so much more than a documentary or some kind of advertisement for the Sierra Club or something.  It is truly something to be experienced.<br />Now for the bad news.  The picture quality on the DVD is spectacular, so too the songs.  However, there are some moments of rather loud static in between the songs.  It sounded to me at first like the wind or part of the film but then I realized it's not.  It sounds like tape hiss (and I know for certain that it isn't my sound system).  Perhaps bad transfer or a bad original, I don't know, but it is almost, though not quite, distracting enough to put a damper on it.  <br />So five stars for the film and the music, four (even three) on the DVD.
0425170349|4.0|This was the first time I have ever read a Tom Clancy novel.  I know some of you are probably asking why I chose this one to start with.  Well the answer is simple.  I didn't want to read a Jack Ryan book, and this one deals with John Clark.  I'm sure I would have had a deeper understanding of some of the other characters who are in the book if I read some of Clancy's other books first, but I really enjoyed this novel.  <br />I put off reading Tom Clancy because I'm not usually a fan of the most popular authors (King, Grisham, Patterson, ect.).  However after some prodding I broke down and read Rainbow Six.  It was great.  I am a big fan of action movies, and that is exactly how this book read.  There are 5 big action sequences, with minor action scenes, like training, thrown in for good measure.  And when bullets and testosterone are not flying, there are some pretty good character moments.  Having never read a Clancy novel before I now feel that I know John Clark and Domingo &quot;Ding&quot; Chavez pretty well.  <br />Some people argue that the book doesn't really get going until the end, but I beg to differ.  I like the lead up the climax.  I liked the espionage that was going on.  <br />All in all I would highly recommend this book.  It is well worth the time put into it.  Plus it has an ending that I just was not expecting, and that is always a plus.
B000002UDB|5.0|The original packaging for this album was terrific, and included a 24 page colour booklet and cover that seemed to be a companion to the Sgt Pepper gatefold sleeve and inclusions. It inspired the crazy Rutles record cover, with its joke song titles, such as Tragical History Tour and its hilarious interviews with Mick Jagger and Paul Simon, and the story of the parody band The Rutles.<br />So the poor quality of the CD leaflet is all the more noticeable.<br />But there are many terrific songs included on the CD. John Lennon's Strawberry Fields Forever and I Am the Walrus are still interesting, thirty five years after they were originally released. I recommend you also listen to the versions of these songs in the Beatles second Anthology CD, which gives some insight into how they were created.<br />Other favourite tracks include<br />Magical Mystery Tour<br />The Fool On the Hill<br />Penny Lane<br />and<br />All You Need Is Love
B000069AUI|3.0|I very much enjoyed most of the music on this CD. They use their influences tastefully. Unfortunately for the band, when it came time to drop lyrics into the mix, they appeared to be creatively exhausted: e.g. the forced rhymes on Green Eyes &quot;Honey you are a rock/Upon which I stand/And I came here to talk/I hope you understand...&quot; Or, more pabulum from the same song: &quot;I could never go on without you&quot; Thick. How many times have you heard that line, in how many imbecilic pop cheeze puffs? Or &quot;until I fill all your hearts desire,&quot; or &quot;tell me something worth fighting for&quot; or &quot;And I know the mistakes that I've made&quot; or &quot;disappear without a trace.&quot; Beaten senseless by overuse. How about the unmitigated cornball crassness of &quot;When am I gonna see that pretty face again.&quot; That wouldn't even fly in a love letter without irony, it feels so hackneyed and disingenuous. And the &quot;honey&quot; this and the &quot;oh yeah, oh yeah&quot; that... Oh yeah? Oh no. All so gratuitous and lazy. Back to school, kids. Maybe the next CD will be more evenly inventive? For this listener, Coldplay's sophomor effort rings sophomoric indeed.
B000003TAW|5.0|This album defined Weezer and rock music for a generation of young fans.  This album is full of original and creative songs that make you want to get up and belt them out.  This is definitely a must have for any fan of rock music.
B000002C1W|5.0|Just because Roger Waters wanted to take all the toys home and play with them himself doesn't mean that the other boys had to let him.  I've liked some of Waters' work a lot, seen the man perform solo, and he seems to be a nice chap.  But he should have done &quot;Radio K.A.O.S.&quot; to get his solo needs out of his system, and then went back to the band.  <br />This album can hold it's head up high as a great Pink Floyd album, Waters or no Waters.  It's no &quot;Wall&quot;, but at least we don't have to hear another album of Roger complaining about his mother.  There are a few musical interludes (&quot;New Machine&quot;) that don't particulary grab me, but &quot;Animals&quot; had a lot more dry moments, in my opinion.  Overall there are songs and concepts here that are as good as anything the band every did. <br />Ya got yer high and mighty concepts like the other albums, but with this album I actually think I can figure them out.  I'm going to take &quot;Learning to Fly&quot; literally and just enjoy the song.  While &quot;The Dogs of War&quot; is obvious, a much more earnest effort is &quot;On the Turning Away&quot;.  The lyrics &quot;Is it only a dream that there'll be no more turning away&quot; is as cryptic as I need to get.  OK, so &quot;Sorrow&quot; slips into some old habits as we meet the guy who talks to rivers, but I can listen to the drumming on that song all day.  <br />Too bad we didn't get a lot more albums this good.

079284131X|5.0|Everyone has that one horror movie that freaked them out as a child. For me, Child's Play is that one movie. Of course, it didn't help that I shared the same name and age as the main character when I first saw this movie. I spent my entire childhood avoiding anything \\"Chucky\\" related (even his beach-house appearance on MTV to promote Child's Play 3 was too much for me) because he simply freaked me out. But today, it is one of my favorite films and I enjoy it to the fullest everytime I watch it. The story revolves around a 6 year old boy named Andy (Alex Vincent), who wants a Good Guy doll for his birthday (Good Guy dolls talk and \\"react\\" to humans to a certain extent). The problem is, his mother Karen (Catherine Hicks) is strapped for cash and can't afford one of these dolls. When she finds a peddler in an alley willing to let one of the Good Guys go for thirty bucks, she gladly takes home little Chucky, not knowing what she really paid for. The minute Chucky comes home, strange things start to happen, TV's turn on, footsteps are heard often and people go through windows. Andy insists to everyone that the reason for these occurences is that his doll is harboring the soul of the famous Lakeshore Strangler, Charles Lee Ray (a.k.a. Chucky). So naturally, like every horror movie, nobody believes him. Yes, the movie is a bit dated. The midget in the costume gag was a little too obvious at times, but the movie still sends chills down the spine. It also has a lighter side, with a little bit of black humor being tossed around, you'll find yourself laughing at really horrible things. It is also the beginning of another horror franchise with many sequels, in the tradition of Halloween, Friday the 13th and the likes. I still love this movie all these years later.  The DVD isn't really a big deal. It's in full screen format (ugh) and has a theatrical trailer included. I recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't already seen it. It really is necessary viewing.
B000053V7Q|5.0|This film shows, along with the '68 Comeback Special, Elvis on Tour, and Aloha From Hawaii, why Elvis was, and always will be the king.  In this Elvis has the energy of a hurricane all wrapped up in one incredible man.  He is lean and awesome.  His voice has this great tone about it that I think sounds better than when he started out.  The sound quality is so completely awesome and perfect that it sounds like it could have been recorded on today's modern equipment.  The picture quality is equally as impressive.  It's crystal clear, sharp, and not grainy in the least.  This DVD would convert any serious music fan into an Elvis fan, and if it doesn't - they're tone deaf.
B00005QDW1|5.0|This album is no different in greatness than any of their other superb albums they have come up with. What, they are so different because of a little reggae mixed in to only TWO of their songs on the album (Hey Baby and Underneath It All)? I think not. Besides, the reggae sounds good with those songs anyway; they belong in those songs. This album has the same signature No Doubt feel as their other masterpieces. Listen to it a few times before you put back in your collection to collect dust (or even sell it? NO!...). You should discover its greatness as yet another superb No Doubt album.
6304479689|5.0|The only major difference in Elvis' appearance between this film and 'That's The Way It Is' is that he doesn't have a tan, and his hair is longer.  Elvis is NOT heavier, and even if he is, it couldn't be by more than 5 pounds.  He is very lean in this, with a small waistline and overall striking figure.  His voice is beautiful, and I love to hear how it matured and improved over the years.  In this film, his voice is smooth, rich, and powerful.  The way he sings &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water&quot; knocks the original version right off the map.  His energy during the song &quot;Polk Salad Annie&quot; is startling, this version being markedly faster than the 1970 version.  The Stamps are spotlighted singing the moving gospel song &quot;Sweet Sweet Spirit&quot; that can move you to tears, especially seeing Elvis standing aside and admiring one of his heroes, J.D. Sumner.  &quot;I Got a Woman&quot;,&quot;Lawdy Miss Clawdy&quot;,&quot;Burning Love&quot;...this film has no shortage of rockers.  Also we get to go into the recording studio with Elvis while he records the song &quot;Separate Ways&quot;, a poignant ballad about lost love clearly selected to mirror Elvis life while he was separated from Priscilla.  We get to go backstage with Elvis and see his human side, he says &quot;I've never gotten over what they call stage fright, I go through it every show&quot;.  A long interview with Elvis was recorded to accompany some of the non musical moments, and we hear the man himself telling his story.  They flash back to 1956 and show some of Elvis' early TV appearances to great effect.  It was filmed in stereo, and plays just fine in Dolby surround.  It's energetic, exciting, and contains some great songs.  A must for any Elvis fan or fan of live concerts.
0345404475|1.0|We are told below that this \\"one of the best books ever written by man\\", comparable presumably, then, to The Odyssey, The Bible, Canterbury Tales, Hamlet, Don Quixote, Walden, Critique of Pure Reason, The Sun Also Rises, and The Unbearable Lightness of Being. Let's assume, however, out of hand, for the sake of argument, that it really is \\"one of the best books ever written by man\\": How does it compare to the best books written ever by rooster, drake, or bull (speaking of bull)? What? Was its author awarded the Nobel Prize in Quasi-literate B Science-fiction Pulp? Is this a new category? Let's assume, however, out of hand, for the sake of argument, that it really is worthy of a Nobel Prize in Quasi-literate B Science-fiction Pulp: Wouldn't you still rather read the back of your box of Fruit Loops?

B00006IU73|5.0|I have most of PT's CDs...Stupid Dream, Recordings, Signify, Lightbulb Sun, etc... While the former CD's are excellent roughly 70% of the time...this new CD is ALL fanatstic. For some wierd reason it reminds me of Trick of the Tail in atmosphere.  <BR>Where prior CD's fall short was accessibility and even flow (IMO).  From the opener Black Eyes (which I push repeat to the point of self-embarrassment) to the close...this CD just blows me away.  I thought Spock's SNOW was the pinnacle of 2002 CD's...well I stopped listening to SNOW a week ago...replaced by PT's In Absentia...incredible CD...all of it this time. Also, new drummer Gavin Harrison elevates the overall groove and kick of the band.  Great switch.
B00005JKZT|5.0|Alright, I know I'm once again breaking the rules by writing a review for the trailor instead of the movie, but in my defense I'm not the only one impatiently awaiting the next installment in the Lord of the Rings trilogy and if Amazon.com didn't want input before the movie's release, then they wouldn't have this webpage up! Anyway, if you don't find my review for the brand new trailor helpful, I hope at least that you find it interesting.<br />The brand new trailor, not yet shown in theatres, once again got my heart pumping due to the incredible amount of new scenes, new dialouge and new characters that were held within it. It's much better put together than the first trailor which was a bit clumsy and choppy (as some reviewers have noted) but this new one can be found at the official sight and I strongly advise heading down there to download it.<br />It begins much as the preview did, with Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas on the hunt for the captured Merry and Pippen - only in this one they are stopped by the Riders of Rohan and we get our first good look at Eomer who questions them on their presence suspiciously, but sends them on their way (and all of this filmed practically on my backdoor!) It moves to include shots of Merry and Pippen in the orc's imcampment and Frodo and Sam descending into the Emyn Muil who comment on their lack of direction. With all the broken Fellowship accounted for, it immediatly launches into shots of other characters.<br />Many include furthering the relationship between Aragorn and Arwen - there are many shots of them together and Elrond sternly telling Aragorn - \\"Our time here is ending. Arwen's time is ending. Let her go\\" and telling Arwen - \\"There is nothing for you here, only death.\\" There is certainly pressure on them to part ways, but Arwen quietly answers her father -\\"There is still hope,\\" even after Elrond predicts that Aragorn will not return. Purists at this point may be concerned at these extensive love scenes, none of which appear in the book, but let me explain: although there are rumours that Arwen appears at Helm's Deep, we can be fairly certain this is *not* true. Instead the elves abandon Rivendell for the Grey Havens(there is a beautiful shot of their departure in the trailor) and Arwen takes the still un-forged Shards of Narsil with her.<br />But the trailor doesn't focus solely on the love story - along with Eomer there are many scenes of Eowyn and the much anticipated Bernard Hill as King Theoden, who is being conselled by Gandalf and Aragorn to prepare for war. He is reluctant, but much of the dialouge includes talk of the Uruk-Hai and their purpose to wipe out the world of men. Theoden declares: \\"I will not risk open war!\\" and Aragorn replies: \\"Open war is upon you, whether you would risk it or not.\\" Eowyn to gets some good scenes - Theoden orders her to led the refugees from Rohan, we see her looking quite feminine at one stage and there is an intriguing scene with her and Aragorn where she asks him - \\"Who is she? The one who gave you that jewel?\\" It would seem Peter Jackson is heightening the love triangle between Aragorn, Eowyn and Arwen, though for better or worse remains to be seen.<br />And thankfully, there is more of Frodo and Sam. There was very little of them in all previous previews for the Two Towers, but here there are some very VERY amazing scenes of them struggling with Gollum and appointing him as their guide through Mordor; Frodo brandishing a sword; Frodo falling face-first to the ground (possibly fainting?) and Sam crying out that the Ring \\"is taking hold of you!\\" (P.S. thanks to the reviewers who wrote in explaining Frodo's role in the next book, but all I meant in my previous review was that there was surprising little of him in the *preview* - I assume because his journey through Mordor isn't as visually exciting as the rest of character's travels).<br />Now brace yourselves, as the last portion of the trailor picks up speed, and to incredible music flashes through scenes of: the blazing eye of Sauron atop Barad-dur; an awe-inspiring shot of the orc legions; Saruman and Wormtongue; fleeting but clear glimpses of the Wargs; an ent swooping down and lifting Merry off his feet; an oliphaunt; tantalising glimpses of Gandalf's battle with the Balrog; Shadowfax; battle sequences on horseback; Gandalf's return to the three hunters; and more of incredible battle at Helm's Deep. Track this trailor down - you won't be sorry, as it adds even more exicitement for December!<br />From the trailor - \\"The Fellowship has broken...the Power of Darkness Grows...All Will Be Sacrificed...All Will Be Lost...Unless All Unite Against Evil...\\"<br />P.S. - If your reading this AFTER the movies' release, please don't vote, as obviously this review will be obselete.hrough scenes of: the blazing eye of Sauron atop Barad-dur; an awe-inspiring shot of the orc legions; Saruman and Wormtongue; fleeting but clear glimpses of the Wargs; an ent swooping down and lifting Merry off his feet; an oliphaunt; tantalising glimpses of Gandalf's battle with the Balrog; Shadowfax; battle sequences on horseback; Gandalf's return to the three hunters; and more of incredible battle at Helm's Deep.

B00005JL1C|4.0|Cute in the sense that it rises above most teen-angst films of the era.  Boy likes girl, girl doesn't know he exists but his best friend adores him.  Mary Stuart Masterson was the right pick for the character of Watts.  Notice the kiss scene:  Masterson exhibits the perfect balance of nervous tension and school girl charm, holding back and striking at the right moment.  Mary, you should have gotten tons of work after this performance but I think you were typecasted.  At least we still have this film to cherish.  The Paramount DVD is nearly worthless; sporting only a crispy widescreen transfer without a commentary or any other extras.  That's too bad.
B0000042MY|5.0|This OST consists of 16 incredibly beautiful and deeply moving music that complemented scenes from the movie perfectly. Trevor Jones composed the first 9 tracks of the album, while Randy Edelman wrote Tracks 10 - 15 (Track 16 is a short song by the group Clannad). Both Jones and Edelman did a brilliant job on the album, although Jones's &quot;Main Title&quot; and another track, &quot;Promentory&quot; remain the most memorable numbers (and my favourites). I also like Jones's &quot;The Kiss&quot; and &quot;The Glade Part II&quot;.<br />A couple of Edelman's compositions which I find truly beautiful and outstanding are &quot;The Courier&quot; and &quot;Cora&quot;.<br />I play this soundtrack every morning before leaving for work and first thing upon returning home. The music soothes the soul and makes me think (and dream) of the movie a lot, especially of the handsome and heroic Uncas, who's my favourite character in the movie. In my mind and heart, &quot;Promentory&quot; will always be Uncas's song (it recalls vividly to the mind the poignant scene towards the end of the movie of Uncas climbing the cliffs determinedly and fearlessly in order to rescue his love, Alice).<br />How I adore the movie and its music! They will remain my favourites FOREVER.
B000068IEU|4.0|those who are familiar with this film know full well there have been so many claims as to its cut status that even as i listened to the commentary by wes craven and sean cunningham i realized i dont think even they know if this is the original film or not i guess this is the best we can expect for now i felt as if id seen more all those many years ago at the drive in and especially the end when the chainsaw attack is over ... as to a review of the film itself i can only say the best review is the ad campaign itself and to this day it still sums up this little classic exploitation gem a combination of ripoff and bad acting ---- just remember ---- its only a movie only a movie only a movie.........

Also, the creator's name is Joss (not Josh) Whedon.<br />Once More, with Feeling is one of the best hours of television I've ever seen, and remains so with repeat viewings! I'm certain the soundtrack won't disappoint.
0316666343|4.0|I read this book in one sitting, I was so hooked.  I wept continuously as I read it.  The one character who I felt was unsatisfyingly written was the mother - I never felt as if I got to grips with her.  Perhaps that is intentional?  No matter.  This is an important novel and I would urge everyone to read it.
B000066NW0|5.0|Not many people know of Avril Lavigne in the UK, but that will change very soon. With a little more radio airplay, she will become extremely popular. 'Complicated' has everyone talking, but that song is just one gem among 13. 'Let Go' is one of those albums that you just stick in and enjoy. No fiddling around making playlists or changing track.<BR>The rocky opener 'Losing Grip' isn't really a sign of things to come - a great song in itself but a slightly different variety than the next 12. Then comes 'Complicated' followed by the excellent 'Sk8er Boi', hinting of Blink 182 influences or other modern punk-rock. 'I'm with you' is a slow, soulful number; Avril shows maturity beyond her years.<BR>Its followed by 'Mobile', which could be described as pop with its catchy chorus and tune, but is still a great hit and one of my favourites. 'Unwanted' is on similar lines to 'Losing Grip' at number 6. 'Tomorrow' resembles 'I'm with you' as its a beautiful song, proving Avril has variety in her diet. 'Anything But Ordinary' is a great hit where Avril reaches high notes in yet another catchy chorus, another favourite.<BR>On the subject of favourites, 'Things I'll Never Say' is quite simply stunning. With unorthodox 'la-la-las', Avril could be mistaken for Shakira but it works a treat and this track will be huge. 'My World' is very good (no surprise there then). Yet another chorus that will buzzing around in your mind for days on end. Its followed by a completely different track in 'Nobody's Fool' where Avril attempts to rap and doesn't let herself down. At first I didn't think it worked but after numerous plays, it gains an thumbs-up. 'Too much to ask' is fantastic. It seems to be directed towards a former boyfriend and therefore, includes great passion. 'Naked' wraps things up well - another good listen. <BR>So, in a nutshell, its a wonderful album. Full of catchy choruses and enthusiastic sound. Go buy it.

B000024D4R|5.0|There is no question about it, Animals remains one of the greatest albums ever, standing as the only effective combination of progressive elements and a punk attitude. However, I have a bit of a grudge towards it as it marked the beginning of the end of Pink Floyd, serving as a predecessor to The Wall disaster,The Final Cut, and eventually lyrical mastermind Roger Waters' departure, ending the reign of the greatest bands to ever grace rock. But that isn't a reason to not love this album. <br />It was 1977, and prog rock was fading. Disco and punk were in, and Pink Floyd and other bands that were hot only two years ago were percieved as \\"dinosaurs.\\" So Pink Floyd they would adapt their sound to the times. Enter Roger Waters's prog-punk baby Animals, a brutal attack on the structure of human society, and blatant proof that whatever the Sex Pistols could do, they could do just as well.<br />Animals basically serves as a musical interpretation of (insert any George Orwell or Ray Bradbury novel here), dividing man into three fragments/opuses; Dogs (the upper/ruling class, clocking in at 17 minutes), Pigs (Three Different Ones) (the agenda pushing, morale enforcing hypocrites who stand up there with the dogs, 11 minutes), and the Sheep (who blindly follow the leader, the lean one here at 10 minutes), and bookended by the touching, beautiful, two part ballad Pigs on the Wing. (a combined 54 seconds)<br />Obviously what makes this album great is Roger Waters's slashing lyrics, making his points hit home hard. (And it's too late to lose the weight you used to need to throw around: You gotta stem the evil tide, And keep it all on the inside: Harmlessly passing your time in the grassland away, Only dimly aware of a certain unease in the air.) The album, however, hits its horrifying peak in Sheep, when Waters (thanks to some great production technique) pulls off an almost Satanic voice, and viciously attacks Christianity. However you can't win on songwriting alone, which is where David Gilmour lifts him up, (When will those two ever learn that.) with some of his finest guitar licks, at times matching Waters' darkness (all of Sheep, or the talkbox solos on Pigs), and at times combatting it. (the soothing, Boston like, licks on Dogs) And I haven't even mentioned the killer Rick Wright's killer keyboard play, or Nick Mason stable and underrated drumming. (The only member who was really down to Earth in all this.) Waters may have dominated the album, but without question this was a band effort.<br />Roger Waters would later drag Pink Floyd over the edge, with his nihilistic, egotistical, excesses, and never would be nearly as effective during his solo career. That is the one negative of Animals. It was the last great true Floyd album, (That Gilmour stuff is great, but it sure ain't Floyd.) and it led to the disasters of the next few years. (Sorry, but I am not a Wall fan.) However its status as perhaps the inventor of prog metal (and certainly the only successful prog punk album) makes it a classic, deserving of more attention. If you dig the Clash, but also have a closet love for Dream Theatre, this is your entry into the wonderful world of Pink Floyd.
038533558X|3.0|Harlan Coben's new novel, \\"Gone for Good\\" is about a man named Will Klein who is incredibly unlucky in love.  His first girlfriend, Julie, unceremoniously dumped him eleven years ago.  Shortly thereafter, Julie was raped and murdered.  The prime suspect is Will's brother, Ken, who may be dead, or else he may be a fugitive from justice.  Time passes, and Will finally finds another woman whom he loves, named Sheila.  One day, Sheila suddenly takes off, and Will has no idea why she left or where she went.<br />As the drama unfolds, we gradually learn that Will knows little or nothing about what really happened eleven years ago.  Figuring prominently in the plot are two malevolent villains, one known as the Ghost and the other a Mafia type named McGuane, both boyhood friends of Ken's. The Ghost and McGuane have agendas of their own, and they are not squeamish about destroying anyone who gets in their way.<br />\\"Gone for Good\\" ultimately does not succeed because the book is too \\"busy\\" and plot-driven.  The characters are not developed satisfactorily.  Coben works so hard trying to surprise the reader with endless twists and turns that he forgets an important element of novel writing.  A good thriller appeals not just to the mind, but also to the emotions.  \\"Gone for Good\\" is a puzzling mystery, but it is emotionally unsatisfying and it ultimately falls flat.
B000063DHL|5.0|The best Maiden record. Period. From the fantastic title-song to Alexander the Great, this Maiden album gives the listeners what they want, melodic heavy songs with a band on the top. The songs are just wonderful, the &quot;Loneliness of the lone distance runner&quot; is a superb rock song with a catchy intro and a great solo, &quot;Wasted years&quot; is both hard, fast and beautiful, in it`s own right to be so. &quot;Stranger in a strange land&quot; is a laid back, mysterious rocker with a huge deep feeling in it. In fact, I cannot find any more words to describe the songs, so I`ll leave it like this. I guess my earlier words have described the whole album pretty well. If you want to start listening to Iron Maiden, Somewhere in time is a perfect choise, the songs will get you...CAUGHT SOMEWHERE IN TIME!
B00003CXAA|1.0|Look, the movies are great. No one can argue with that.  The problem is with the quality of the DVDs in this set.  It is terrible.  Everything is so dark and shadowy you can hardly tell who is on screen.  It is actually painful to watch.  I haven't seen the other DVD releases, but I also own the Godfather EPIC (edited chronologically) on VHS and the picture quality is far superior to this DVD collection.  Same goes for the versions I've seen on cable. Some might say that this is the nature of transferring a movie filmed in the early 70's to DVD.  Listen, it seems that Coppola et al spent quite a bit of time doing interviews and voice overs for this DVD collection - they should have spent more time making sure it looked good.  It is an insult to everyone who paid 80 bucks for the thing.<br />One more thing.  It seems there is a problem with the quality of plastic used in the DVD cases.  It is much too brittle.  AFter you remove the DVD and replace it one time the part that holds the DVD in place cracks into little pieces, making the DVD fall out.  I can get a CD for 3 bucks and not have this problem.  Either someone wasn't thinking or was thinking too much.  <br />I feel like sending the thing to Coppola's winery with a dead fish inside.  The message - Francis Coppola's career swims with the fishes.
1568495110|5.0|Alex est le mal incarné.  Il tue, viole, torture sans autre forme de procès, avec un plaisir vicieux.  Il mène une vie de débauche, de soirées d'ultra-violence avec ses trois acolytes, Pierrot, Jo et Momo, jusqu'au jour où ceux-ci le trahissent.  Alex est arrêté et incarcéré relativement aux crimes qu'il a commis.  En prison, on lui propose une cure, la méthode Ludovico, qui, en quelques semaines, fera du monstre qu'était Alex, un humain fondamentalement bon.  Alex accepte immédiatement, voyant un échappatoire rapide à la prison, sans réfléchir aux conséquences d'un tel traitement.  Les résultats seront étonnants, mais Alex sera t-il le même homme?...<br /> L'Orange mécanique fait brillamment émerger toute la violence refoulée d'une société dans le personnage d'Alex.  Le livre est écrit dans un dialecte surprenant, mais ô combien efficace, nous plongeant littéralement aux côtés de Notre Humble Narrateur, Alex.  Le livre lance un débat sur les droits de l'État; peut-il se permettre de conditionner un être humain, sachant que celui-ci perdra la possibilité de faire ses propres choix?  Est-il nécessaire d'éradiquer la liberté d'agir d'un homme pour faire de lui un être moral?  Là est une des questions fondamentales du roman, qui n'est pas sans rappeler l&#8217;inquiétant 1984, écrit par George Orwell.
B00006AUIG|2.0|This movie had potential. Still frames of the Danvers hospital will send a chill up your spine. However, the story just does not create any suspense.<br />The movie has the typical formula of 95% introduction, 5% climax and ending with no middle section. No gradual building of suspense that keeps you at the edge of your seat. <br />Nothing related to the story really happens in the first 95% of the movie, and then in the last 5%, a chain of events occurs. The only problem is that most viewers probably know exactly who is behind the chain of events the minute the first event happens. So there is no \\"whodunnit\\" supspense whatsoever (watch the deleted scenes and director's commentary and you will see this is the type of suspense he was going for). The only suspense is that you are waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting for something to happen. Then it does and you know exactly who did it and why. It is like watching 3 hours of convenience store surveilence tape in anticipation of a robbery and then the thief walks in, waves to the camera, and takes off his mask.<br />The setting is awesome, the acting is pretty good, and the characters are likeable... but the story [stinks]!!!<br />Even though it is a suspense film (which are not believable to begin with, but that is the point), certain things do have to add up to for the film to have any credibility. One huge thing doesn't! Why doesn't Mike just take the tapes home instead wasting the whole work week listening to them, especially when they are trying to get the project done in one week! The movies does a pretty good job of depicting him as a bright, hard-working guy. So why, you ask, would he do something so stupid? Why? Because the sessions are creepy and the director wants to distract you from the fact that nothing is really happening. The result? The whole film seems contrived.<br />[weak].

B000000WA4|5.0|One of the best rock and roll albums ever.
B000002JSN|5.0|PHYSICAL GRAFFITI is an exciting, sprawling masterpiece which combines unreleased early songs with new ones recorded during 1974-75. The best song on the album is up for grabs, but the highlights are many, including the inspirational &quot;The Rover&quot;, &quot;In The Light&quot;, and &quot;Nightflight&quot;; the reflective &quot;Ten Years Gone&quot;; the playful &quot;Down By The Seaside&quot;; the rocking &quot;Custard Pie&quot; and &quot;Houses Of The Holy&quot;; and several others. Sure, there are a few low-grade cuts here, but that's to be expected on such an expansive album as this one. So by all means, make this one of your first Led Zeppelin purchases.
B00005B4GU|5.0|It's rare these days (well, outside of the pop genre) to get two albums from the one group in such a short period of time, but Radiohead did just that, and did a very good job of it.<br />The songs contained on this CD were recorded at the same time as those on Kid A, but rather than release a double album, they did the smart thing and released them as seperate albums. With that fact aside however, Amnesiac and Kid A certainly have a different feel. When I first bought Kid A I didn't much enjoy my first listen. Nor my second or third. I have no problem with &quot;out-there&quot; music (feel free to check out the other CDs I have reviewed...) but Kid A was just to jarring for me. I eventually got a feel for it, and it contains some outstanding tracks. Amnesiac, however, was love at first sight(listen). Where Kid A really threw you straight in to the fire, Amnesiac gently eases you along, providing more melodic songs to go with the more jagged stuff. In fact, I would say that after hearing Amnesiac, I was really better able to get in to Kid A, and I can't help but wonder how my opinion for both albums would have changed had Amnesiac been released first?<br />Regardless, this album contains some great songs, songs that no doubt will fill up a large chunk of my fave all-time radiohead songs when the band calls it a day. Knives Out, Pyramid Song, You and Whose Army?, Dollars &amp; Cents &amp; Life in a Glass House are just fantastic pieces of music that touch me in ways only Radiohead are capable of. I really can't recommend this album enough.
B000002J09|5.0|IV is the best Led Zeppelin album ever to come out. All of the songs are still played on classic-rock radio today, so discussing what one is the best is really pointless. You've got your pure-blood rockers (\\"Black Dog\\", \\"Rock & Roll\\", \\"Misty Mountain Hop\\"); cautionary anthems (\\"Stairway To Heaven\\", \\"When The Levee Breaks\\"); acoustic ballads (\\"The Battle Of Evermore\\", \\"Goin' To California\\"),and the unusual \\"Four Sticks.\\" Some people like to listen to this one really loud, but its uniqueness can only be truly appreciated at a low-to-moderate volume.
B000000993|4.0|If you are trying to get in to Tool and found Ænima and Lateralus to be a little too wierd, than this is perhaps the album for you. It has it's out there moments (disgustipated anyone?), but for the most part, it's very good, agressive rock/metal. Sober was the single, and I'm sure most have heard it at some point, but the hi-lites of the album for me are 4°, Swamp Song &amp; Flood, which all wouldn't have been too out of place on Ænima.<br />I personally rate both Ænima &amp; Lateralus above this album (I prefer the strangeness of them both, along with the longer tracks and increased sophistication of the song writting), but this is where the egg of Tool was really hatched, and it certainly hints at what is to come.
B00004X0Q0|5.0|they were hyped as the saviors of rock and roll before this whole emo trend of... whining and pop punk started selling like heroin in a methadone clinic.  they recorded one of the best albums of the new millenium and decided to break up just before they could inspire thousands of kids to rock in a new way...
B000000I02|5.0|If someone had told me that Hatfield and the North had a loose, jammy style and the songs contained on the album played out like a suite, jumping from style to style, I probably would've passed on this group. Boy, I'm glad I didn't. I purchased this after The Rotter's Club (which I also enjoyed greatly), and despite sounding even a little more loosely structured than the follow-up (I'm usually not a huge fan of music that lacks much structure), I must say I prefer this album over The Rotter's Club. I usually find that when I buy a new album and love it, I play it far too much and get burnt out from it for awhile, though this album is a definate exception. It still sounds as good now as it did the third time I listened to it (hey, it took me a few listens to get in to it!).
B000002NC4|5.0|the pretentious title isn't so pretentious after you hear it...
B00006F7S4|2.0|...By reading their own comments you would expect lower ratings. I was extremely disappointed with this album. Yeah, it's got some beautiful moments, but it is essentially the same song over and over. It certainly is sad and evokes s self-centered mood, but do we really need anyone to take us there in this day and age? \\"Lonesome Tears\\" is the most interesting, but it too falls short of creativity. I love Beck, and I hate to say it, but this album BORED ME TO DEATH. It truly appears to me that not alot of work went into this project. I can say that if you like monotony and predictable musical arrangements, this is the album for you...<BR>Go ahead all Beck-is-God followers, rate me bad, but it's not going to change the fact that this album truly is not good.
0899668380|5.0|I AM LEGEND remains an all time favorite in my library. It is the first book I read cover to cover (simply because I wanted to read)and started my love affair with reading that has continued since 1972. I bought the paperback that was released as a Tie-In to \\"The Omega Man\\" and was surprised to find that the movie had so little in common with the book.<br />This is a review for the book, SO I have to say that a recent rereading of this book left me feeling like I had read A CLASSIC. In my years, I have been in awe of Richard Mathesons imagination, growing up with his stories on the Twilight Zone/Night Gallery, his movies and books (even \\"The Beardless Warriors\\") remain in my library.<br />\\"I Am Legend\\" doesn't conjure gory images, it weaves a story that is riveting. The chapters where he finds the dog in the daylight and all that follows, still leaves me with feelings for Robert Neville that never seem to come through in so many other books, classic or otherwise.<br />I would certainly like to see it done right as a movie. I have only seen bits and pieces if the one with Vincent Price, but it isn't necessary. The impressions left by the book (always in black and white in my mind) are still quite fresh and will be years from now.
B000069HKH|1.0|This album is a waste of money. With its soppy sentimental country and western like ballads it seems a far cry from the Bruce that I expected. This style is assuredly not rock and roll--even cranking up the volume did not make it more palatable. It sounds like a cross between Neil Diamond and the Oak Ridge Boys. I want a refund!
B00005LB9O|4.0|While this cd basically just the Man Who, part II, it is still a must-buy. Travis pairs its beautiful twisting melodies with beautiful twisting lyrics and gets a beautiful twisting cd. Not only does The Invisible Band show off Fran Healy's simple but eloquent lyrical talent, but the bonus track of &quot;Ring Out the Bell&quot; cooed and written by Dougie Payne is a gorgeous song. &quot;Sing&quot; is to the point and sweet, &quot;Flowers in the Window&quot; is bright and well, flowery, &quot;Pipe Dreams&quot; articulates melancholy spirituality perfectly, &quot;Indefinitely&quot; is... I've run out of adjectives to describe this album. Just buy it.
B000002VDW|4.0|It's common and perhaps even easy for some music fans to trash Time Passages for an obvious reason:  It was the album that immediately followed Stewart's signature CD and song 'Year of the Cat,' so the collection was a bit over analyzed compared to his earlier works.  While the title track was clearly produced to hit the top 40, that shouldn't stop music fans from enjoying the rest of the CD, because it contains a number of Stewart gems.  Life in Dark Water ranks among his best.  I recently 'rediscovered' Al Stewart and even had the pleasure of seeing him play a small club before kicking off a worldwide tour.  Part of me hopes he has another big hit so others can discover just how good he is, but then there's another side of me that would like to keep him a secret to be enjoyed only by those who appreciate his folksie-rock style that has aged as fine as the wine he freely admits he enjoys.  'Year of the Cat' and 'Modern Times' are considered by many to be his best, but I'm partial to 'Past, Present and Future.'  Get them all.  You won't be disappointed.
0679777547|2.0|The Club Dumas is a mediocre detective story dressed up with literary references.  The style is by turns overwrought and predictable.  The characters, with one or two exceptions, lack any depth at all.  And mistakes appear everywhere: the narrator slips and refers to himself in the third person, a one-armed woman tears a page out of a book and rips it into tiny pieces, &quot;clausae patent&quot; is translated as &quot;they will open that which is closed,&quot; woodcuts are continually referred to as engravings, etc., etc.  I cannot recommend this.
6305137293|3.0|The way his other movies are selling right now, namely The Fog in it's Special Edition DVD should tell John Carpenter and Rick Rosenthal that a \\"special edition\\" of Halloween 2 is MUCH needed.Okay i own the \\"goodtimes\\" edition dvd and while it looks pretty good, the sound quality really leaves something to be desired for a dvd. I'm really looking forward to a special edition or a re-release version of this movie, it DOES deserve it. I love the fact this movie picks up right where the first one ended and this movie is full of classic scenes you just don't forget. As much as i love the original, i really do love the sequel. Classic lines like \\"i shot him six times\\" and do you want mayo on your sandwich? what about mustard?...are you asleep again? (in the background you see Night of the Living Dead on the TV. \\"they're coming to get you barbara\\".. How classic is that? Right ON !! This is a great halloween movie.<br />I watch this every Halloween and the holiday just isn't the same without it. I'll be looking for and waiting for a great 5.1 Dolby Digital or DTS version of this movie. A version with Commentary by Rick Rosenthal and Deleted scenes would be awesome,digitally remastered from the original print. In the meantime guess, this will just have to do.
B00003CX9S|5.0|\\"The Elephant Man,\\" director David Lynch's sophomore major film effort, seems to be groomed for greatness from the beginning.  The story of John Merrick, a horribly deformed person who lived in London in the Victorian age and became somewhat of a celebrity among medical and social circles in that time, \\"The Elephant Man\\" is many things: a historical throwback to an earlier style of filmmaking, a story of human triumph, and a film designed to tug at the heartstrings and manipulate with them.  Lynch isn't known for making \\"easy\\" films.  Even his blue-collar masterpiece \\"The Straight Story,\\" released more than 15 years after \\"The Elephant Man,\\" has a depth and complexity not found in many novels.  \\"Elephant\\" may stand as the one exception to this rule.<br />In a dank, filthy, black-and-white London, Dr. Frederick Treves (played by a much younger Anthony Hopkins before he became typecast as another, more evil Doctor) visits a carnival sideshow.  Therein, he discovers John Merrick, the Elephant Man, a person whose bone structure has been twisted so that it appears he has a tusk growing from his swollen, malformed face.  Treves recognizes Merrick as a medical curiosity, and plucks him from being a carnival exhibit to being a teaching tool for his classes.  In a fit of compassion, Treves wonders if Merrick might actually be able to understand what goes on around him, and discovers that he is correct: the Elephant Man, while deformed on the outside, has a perfectly working mind and is fully cognizant of others, language, and actions.  The rest of the movie follows Merrick as he tries to be recognized for the simple fact that he's a human being.<br />Because of this fairly straightforward treatment of a very serious subject - what does it mean to be human, and to have human rights and dignity - \\"Elephant\\" doesn't reach the same levels of depth as \\"Blue Velvet\\" or even \\"Straight Story.\\"  It's unfortunate, because Lynch is a very capable director, and it almost seems as if decisions were made not on the basis of what would make the best movie, but what would appeal to more people (and more award-shows).<br />Don't misunderstand, \\"Elephant\\" manages its subject matter with far more finesse than most other films that attempt to breach the same territory, it's simply that it had the potential to be more than it was.  The acting is wonderful, and John Hurt was literally robbed for his Oscar as Merrick - the emotional range he portrays with body language alone reflects a mastery of his craft.  As with all Lynch films, the meticulous attention to detail and cinematographical excellence are welcome qualities in a time when most movies settle for computer-rendered effects and pointing the camera at some people.<br />Rent \\"Elephant Man.\\"  As emotionally draining as this movie can be, you may want to watch it before you buy it, because it's not something you'll pop in the DVD player on a Friday night just to watch.<br />Final Grade: A-isions were made not on the basis of what would make the best movie, but what would appeal to more people (and more award-shows).<br />Don't misunderstand, \\"Elephant\\" manages its subject matter with far more finesse than most other films that attempt to breach the same territory, it's simply that it had the potential to be more than it was.

B00006J3WH|5.0|Since it's debut on our TV screens, &quot;Buffy The Vampire Slayer&quot; has had a strong following and has since developed cult status, and rightfully so.  Every season, creator Joss Whedon would bring out the best of his cast with each week's original episodes.  Sometimes humourous, sometimes terrifying and often heartbreaking.  In its 6th Season, probably the darkest season, the infamous musical episode made its appearance and has quickly become a favourite episode.  And now the wait is over, and the music from that episode has landed on its own soundtrack.  One you can play again and again.<br />All of the cast give their vocal chords a workout, and whilst they all aren't great vocalists, their voices are suited to their respective tunes.  Sarah Michelle Gellar (Buffy) shows she can hold a note on the preppy &quot;Going Through The Motions&quot; interspliced with her fighting a series of backup singing demons.  Whilst its her soulful rock/pop &quot;Something To Sing About&quot; where its her finest hour, or 4 minutes.  Occasionally her voice falls flat but the honesty, emotion and pain brought in adds up to be one of the album highlights.  On a happier note, Nicholas Brendon (Xander) and Emma Caulfield (Anya) share a jazzy duet on &quot;I'll Never Tell&quot;, where they express their love and their fear of the their relationship.  Both actors aren't the best vocalists but are having such a great time that it's hard not to sing along.  Amber Benson (Tara) shows amazing vocal skills in her whimsical love song &quot;I'm Under Your Spell&quot;.  Elsewhere Anthony Steward Head (Giles), who has already proved he has a great voice, is right at home with the rock ballad &quot;Standing&quot;.  And last but not least James Marsters (Spike) goes gothic/rock/pop on &quot;Rest In Peace&quot;, where he showcases impressive and unexpected vocals.<br />The group performances are also worth a listen, or two.  &quot;I've Got A Theory/Bunnies/If We're Together&quot; is a fun mixture allowing each actor their own part.  The rock edge of &quot;Walk Through The Fire&quot; and the sweet &quot;Where Do We Go From Here&quot; bring out the raw emotions of each character in the best way possible.<br />Overall the album is a must for any Buffy fan, and if you're not, you should check it out regardless as it holds its own as an Andrew Lloyd Weber style musical, only this one has more attitude.  GET SOME FEELING TODAY!
0316666343|4.0|The novel, unlike most stories that focuses around a murder, begins with the murder scene with a chillingly vivid description of the act.  Our story is then told from the eyes of the victim watching down on Earth from her heaven.  <br />Susie Salmon, \\"like the fish,\\" is a girl left perpetually 14, her age at her time of death.  Her tail is beautifully told.  Her voice, sometimes sounding so young and childish, sometimes wise beyond her years, is typical of her age and ads depth to her character.  <br />The story is suspenseful, enthralling and atypical of a novel involving a murder in that the killer is revealed within the first few pages of the book to the reader but not to the characters. The story is a beautiful commentary on growing up and grief.  The author breaches many touchy subjects such as teenage sexuality, religion, belief in the afterlife and the supernatural with gentle hand. <br />Expertly written and a must read.

B000066NW0|5.0|This CD is the first CD I have bought where every single song ROX!!!  I love Avril Lavigne!  And she DOES write her own songs!  In fact, she gets madwhen some1 else writes them.  I'm a total Avril fanatic!  Buy this CD, it's well worth your money!  Don't listen to any1 else!
B0000029LG|5.0|I won't spend that much time talking about Disc 1 because, let's face it, the music speaks for itself!  These are truly some of MJ's greatest hits, though I do take issue with some of the song choices.  (For instance, where is \\"Dirty Diana,\\" \\"PYT,\\" Smooth Criminal,\\" \\"Will You Be There,\\" etc.???  I guess those will be featured on HIStory, Book II?  Let's hope!)  Anyways, onto Disc 2.  Alot of people have criticized this cd as being too self-indulgent.  I admit, this is a highly personal cd with more emphasis on Michael getting his anger off his chest (as opposed to entertaining an audience).  But, given that everything that Michael had been through at that point in his career, I think he was entitled to blow off some steam.  Plus, if you can just get past the \\"there-are-no-songs-to-dance-to\\" pouting phase, you will realize that this is probably the smartest and most sophisticated album Michael Jackson has ever released.  Let's go through the tracks, shall we?<br />1) Scream - We all saw the video for this one. Instant classic!  Both Michael and Janet are blowin off steam.  Great track.<br />2) They Don't Care About Us - Even though MJ took some heat for the allegedly anti-semetic lyrics, this song is a very passionate outcry against racism, police brutality, etc., etc.  The driving rhythm is practically addictive.  You'll find yourself humming this one for hours. . . . <br />3) Stranger in Moscow - This is quite possibly the most beautiful ballad MJ has ever written.  The orchestration is flawless and the lyrics are so poignant.  (\\"Take my name and just let me be.\\")  Beautiful song!<br />4) This Time Around - Okay, this is where the angry Michael Jackson starts to get a little bit boring.  *skip*<br />5) Earth Song - Another beautiful ballad with awesome lyrics!  Though it can be easily be blown off as just another \\"humanity\\" song, it really has a pointed message about environmental justice.  Listen up!<br />6) D.S. - Okay, now this track is strictly self-indulgent.It's not even a very good song . . . but MJ is angry at \\"Dom Sheldon\\" (wink, wink) and he wants to let the world know about it . . . what are you gonna do.<br />7) Money - Lyrically, this song is fantastic!  Although Michael mostly talks through this song (or is he trying to rap?), the message behind the song makes up for the somewhat awkward vocalization.  Great track!<br />8) Come Together - In my opinion, this remake far exceeds the Beatles' original.  This song is actually reminiscent of the Michael Jackson of the \\"Bad\\" era (which makes sense, since that's when he first performed it in the Moonwalker video).  Great song, great vocals, great music!<br />9) You Are Not Alone - As much as I dislike R. Kelly and the fact that ALL of his songs sound the same, this one really grows on you.  Michael really shows off his vocals here and reminds us that he's one of the greatest singers alive!<br />10) Childhood - Though it can easily be dismissed as lame, this song is probably the best one on the cd in that it has incredibly poignant lyrics, beautiful orchestration, and excellent vocals.  I think this is the most personal song Michael Jackson has ever written - absolutely beautiful.<br />11) Tabloid Junkie - This song is incredible!  Thanks to the participation of Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis, this song has more of a \\"Janet\\" feel to it.  But, for MJ, it really works!  The lyrics, the beats, the melody . . . flawless!<br />12) 2 Bad - Not one of the best songs on the cd.  Take it or leave it.<br />13) HIStory - This song isn't really a \\"song\\" as much as it is an anthem.  I really like the way MJ interweaves snippets from historical speeches/statements with a triumphant chorus.  Great stuff!<br />14) Little Susie - This song demonstrates that if Michael ever gets sick of making cds, he would have a great career as a broadway composer!  This is a hauntingly beautiful ballad about a little girl who was murdered.  It definitely had a lot of drama to it.  Beautiful!<br />15) Smile- This is a fantastic way to end his double-disc set!  Not only is this song a tribute to one of MJ's personal heroes (Charlie Chaplin), but it also seems to encapsulate his own attitude about everything that has happened to him with regard to public scutiny, child molestation allegations, etc., etc.  Michael gives a heart-felt delivery that just brings a smile to my face, literally.

You can't put the book down at night because the ending of each chapter is a cliff-hanger.  Tip:  Don't predict the ending because you may be dissapointed!  The whole series (The Golden Compass, The Subtle Knife, and The Amber Spyglass) are must read books!!!! :)
B00005JKNF|4.0|if one looks to this movie to solve/watch some mystery then one will most probably be disappointed. however, chances are that one is looking to see how altman pulls another one out of his magic hat case in which one will be yet again handsomely rewarded.<br />to be appreciated about this movie would be the tension between people belonging to different worlds in a veritable exercise of sharing. casting, costumes, location and all the tricks of the trade are impeccably taken care of to the delight of the viewer.<br />and, in case one still wonders about the mystery of this movie, it fizzles out at the end, time by which altman had laid his (postmodern) spell on the viewer.
B000002GYR|5.0|Having a few Tom Waits albums as well as the newer cd Mule Variations which I feel is his number 2 best album, Closing Time is definately his number one masterpiece. This album has a way of taking you away, maybe to a lonely time, maybe to a bar twenty years ago, maybe having you remember thoughts you may have forget about. I try to find emotions in music and that sets it apart from the others. Tom's voice was not at it's scratchy harsh tones yet(even though I love that also) and was his earliest recording. Some of the highlights are; <BR> Ol 55 starts the album off on a winning note, no the Eagles did not write this, Tom did. You heard it but have not heard it yet unless you have this one. The next song, I hope I don't fall in love with you will get to you, a somber tuneful song that keeps you in the mood of this album's theme, an amazing song. Lonely is a highlight and while listening you can feel the lonesome mood of Tom and experience it for yourself through this song. Grapefruit Moon is also a highlight and keeping with the lonely theme, \\"Grapefruit Moon, One Star Shining\\", sheer poetry. If you have not experienced early Tom Waits, this is a must. It is one of those albums that no matter what genre of music you enjoy will get to you and stay with you forever.
B0000640VO|3.0|this is not your typical french movie; it offers an updated approach. the movie slowly builds an allegory (through several smaller ones) without rewarding the viewer for all the time spent....unless one who cares about naive games, about building a 'greater sense' around quotidian and minuscule occurences--case in which is not that bad movie altogether.

B00005JKDR|4.0|This movie is a technological marvel. Pixar uses computer animation to create a movie that is both enjoyable and interesting.<br />Many people were once afraid of (or still are) monsters in the closet, but what if the monsters were more scared of us than we were of them? What if they were just doing their job?<br />The movie is sure to entertain and delight viewers of all ages, and the DVD quality is very good. I am not so impressed by the special features. I would've expected more on a two DVD set, although there are a few really neat things on the second disc.<br />Overall, I would definitely take a look at Monsters, Inc.
0792845730|4.0|A good science-fiction film does not have to be pure escapism.  A good science-fiction film doesn't have to create new worlds about which we dream.  Instead, good sci-fi takes what is scientifically possible and takes our world to the next step.  Watching this film again after many years, I see that it still stands to the test of time.<br />Peter Weller is Robocop just as Robocop is Officer Murphy.  We know that they are separate entities, but we can not look at one without thinking of the other.  This is one of the main premises of the movie, what makes us who we are.  Robocop is told that he is simply Robocop and is given his order, but he finds that his identity is not dependent on the mechanical body or the feelings.  <br />You can't think of this movie without the background.  This is what makes it great.  The little things the director and writers add to help make the setting make this real.  By far the funniest dig on our culture is the advertisement for the car with low mileage.<br />I would recommend seeing this movie.
006092988X|5.0|I read A Tree Grows in Brooklyn when I was about 12 years old, and have had reason to return to it as an adult.  I recommend that adults who loved this book as a child return to it.  The story of Francie Nolan and her family will most likely have a different, and interesting effect on the reader.  Francie is a bright young girl growing up in a poor, but hardworking family in Brooklyn in 1912.  Although her life is a constant struggle for money, she still manages to eke out much joy.  The novel, which does not really have a plot, is rather a collection of vignettes about Francie's life.  While so much of her life appeared to be conspiring against her success, she never, ever gave up, never gave in to defeatism.  A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is an inspiring and a sweet story, squeaky clean, one which both young teens, and their parents should enjoy.
B000067JBN|3.0|I rented this movie only out of curiosity, I heard the bad reviews that it received but still I wanted to see it.  Like everyone else I enjoyed the beginning and thought maybe they were wrong.  But then a third of the movie went by (I also notice had a  running time of 96 minutes!) and I started to wonder.  I felt like some of it had been accidently left on the cutting room floor, mistakenly not edited back in.  At times it felt like the script was beening written as they went, without much thought to previous scenes.<br />I too feel as though it was rushed, if only another 30 to 45 minutes were added it would have been much better and maybe several things could have been answered in that time. I think I will rent the other one just to see what I have missed.
B00005JLKB|5.0|I was very skeptical when I heard that The WB network was coming out with a show called Smallville,mostly because I grew up with Chirstopher Reeve as Clark Kent/Superman and Gene Hackman as Lex Luther.Well,I wasn't skeptical anymore after watching the last three epsoides of season one.All the actors play their roles so well that the characters they play are so believable.I really enjoyed the fact that the actress who played Lana Lang in the film Superman 3,Annette O'Toole plays Clark's mother.With great plotlines and believable charactors,Smallville is one of my favourite shows on the WB,the other one being Dawson's Creek.The city where I live,Langley BC is just a minute away from where they film Smallville called Cloverdale.A really fun and entertaining show,I recommend any fans of Superman watch Smallville,you won't be dissapointed
6305127638|5.0|This is far and away the best Star Trek movie.  What I liked best about it is the ultimately very positive and hopeful future that it envisions for humanity.  &quot;Disease and war, within 50 years, they'll all be gone.&quot;  YES!  And the movie ultimately explains how this will come to pass, in an entirely believable way that is consistent with &quot;Star Trek history.&quot;  Too bad they had to throw in another world war first...<br />I thought that the acting by all of the main characters was pretty good--some of their best.  Great direction by Jonathan Frakes.
B000007MVL|5.0|The first song of Kate's that I ever heard was Babooshka, I was about 8 at the time. My older sister used to play this song for me and I thought it was quite a funny song.  We used to sing to Kate's songs in the bedroom that we shared together growing up.  I am grateful to my sister for introducing me to such beautiful and moving music.  I am now 32 and I still love Kate Bush so much.  I have not one friend who listens to her, and my fiance cannot stand her voice. It's the music that I play when I want to feel better, when I'm lonely, when I'm having a bath. I just wanted people to know how much this music moves me.  I would have to say that my all time favorite song is 'The Warm Room', on this album. This song is so sensuous and sweet, sung with such feeling. I just can't say enough good about Kate Bush. Those who have never listened to her, just give it one mellow afternoon of listening. I can't see how anyone could not fall in love with this music.

B000002IWQ|4.0|COUNTERPARTS seemed to come out of nowhere when it was released almost ten (!) years ago. I have always enjoyed the mid-70's to early 80's output by Rush, but thru the rest of the 80's and early 90's (with the exception of a few songs) I found much of their material to be quite average and forgettable. By 1993 I had little to do with them outside of occasionally spinning EXIT: STAGE LEFT. I found PRESTO and ROLL THE BONES to be unremarkable to say the least. I guess I got tired of what seemed to me to be half-efforts. <br />My friends and I have come to refer to this as the \\"Rush Syndrome\\"; a band with this disorder seems to be able to forge an album on which only a third to one half of the songs are interesting-they seem like 'works in progress', not yet completed. While COUNTERPARTS did not totally escape this formula, it is one of the best Rush albums of the last 15 years and should be remembered as one of the peaks of their later years.<br />COUNTERPARTS feels alive-the mix is nice and full and the songs are very 'present'. There is nothing worse than a poorly recorded power-trio where the thinness of the arrangments is painfully obvious. Here, the band sounds tight and well-rounded. \\"Animate\\" is a great opener. I bought the album on the strength of \\"Stick It Out\\" and \\"Cut to the Chase\\", songs on which Rush sounds as if they have been re-invigorated or received a blood transfusion. These songs are driving and energetic. It's hard not to tap your feet along and nod your head.<br />There are some other good songs here as well, and a couple of forgettable ones. Over all, this is a strong effort and a return to form of sorts for the band that used to put out pounding tunes like \\"YYZ\\" and \\"La Villa Strangiato.\\" Nice work guys.<br />Recommended.
B00006690G|3.0|Yes, I loved the \\"Eminem Show,\\" at first which was a tight disc with many mature beats and clever lyrics. But I realized with all the screaming-dissing [especially dissing, may I add] and other stuff on this album doesn't make Mr. Mathers 'a lyrical genuis.' Yes, he's a great lyricist--<BR>But if you realize those things don't mix up with pleasurable tunes like the first legendary tale \\"Without Me,\\" the current tale of his hard relation with his mother, and \\"Hailie's Song,\\" which will never be a single no matter what. Other guilty pleasures--\\"Business,\\" and \\"Sing for the Moment,\\" still don't mix in. The annoying self-congratulating hard \\"White America,\\" may make listeners fall asleep in their bed. But what makes you want this album?<BR>Probably the guilty pleasures-<BR>-<BR>like tracks \\"Business,\\" (which has an awesome beat similar to P. Diddy's I Need A Girl 2) \\"Without Me,\\" \\"Sing for The Moment,\\" \\"Hailie's Song,\\" the unattactive \\"Superman,\\" \\"Hailie's Song,\\" and \\"My Dad's Gone Crazy.\\" <br />...

B00005JKED|5.0|I almost turned this dvd down as a rental because I did not want to see another \\"good cop goes bad\\" flick...I am glad I rented it !By now, it is no secret that Denzel's character Alonzo is bad to the bone and rotten to the core all the way from the start of the film. We are only given very subtle background hints as to his character's so called \\"reasons\\" for his fall from grace.Yet, it is never quite clear as to what the actual event was that pushed him over the edge or if it was a culmination of events...<br /> The acting performances were absolutely outstanding and stunning !Ethan Hawke's performance deserves high praise;he was perfect for his role. He had that young, \\"wet behind the ears\\" thing going for him.He was very credible and looked the part. But his chracter also demonstrated that strength and honor should not be judged by physical appearances or on one's age alone ! In one day Hawke's rookie character goes from being naive to... well, getting his...popped in a figurative manner. The difference one day in the life of a rookie drug/undercover enforcement officer will make after \\"learning\\" the ropes from Alonzo will probably make him rethink his next career choice or move !<br />I can now fully understand why Washington received the Oscar...I have never felt so much disgust and contempt for an onscreen law enforcement character gone bad...way bad as I did for this one ! Who said the Oscar for Best Actor can only go to those who played the role of good guy.<br /> The story is gritty and compelling and shows the world that even certain heroes that uphold the law are still human and fallible...this not excusing the fact that a choice ultimately has to be made of whether choosing good or evil and upholding one's own accountability for immoral/illegal actions (there is no \\"gray area\\"...as so many of us would like to believe)! This film is even more involving when the viewer has family members or friends in law enforcement as I do !!!...
B00006DEFA|1.0|I just recently bought this DVD because a.) Amedeus is one of my all time favorite films; and b.) Because the first DVD that was released seemed to me to be a bit lackluster. I already own the first DVD release and I was appaled at the lack of quality of this 'Directors Cut' version. <br />First off, the OLD version looks better! The new DVD I bought is so contrast-y that whenever there is a lot of white or lighter areas on the screen, all of the detail gets washed out. No amount of picture adjustments fixed the problem. <br />At first I thought this could be the result of my cheap DVD player and old TV, but of all of my DVD's (I have about 70, many of them special editions, remastered director's cuts, etc...) the Amedeus director's cut is the ONLY one to have a problem. <br />Just to be sure, I popped in the old Amedeus DVD and it looked much better!<br />The second problem I have with this release is that the 'Director's Cut' version is not at all an improvement. I know that there are always people who prefer the theatrical releases to the director's, but I usually enjoy the extra footage/plot development. In this case, most of the added scenes at best weaken the overal effect of the movie; worst case- they're just terrible scenes with terrible dialogue. <br />The best thing I can say for this DVD is that it's given me a greater appreciation for the cheaper theatrical release of Amedeus. <br />Don't buy this DVD.  <BR>Save a few bucks.<BR>Buy a better version.
0062502182|5.0|I don't know why it took me this long to discover this book, but I think it's wonderful. Furthermore, if it isn't already, I think that \\"The Alchemist\\" should be required reading in high school English Literature. Everyone can learn so much from this. I loved this book because there are so many life lessons in this simple story of a young man's journey to find his treasure, to fulfill his \\"personal legend.\\" Written here are so many different philosophies by how one chooses to live his life.<br />The descriptions of the desert are beautiful. As are the references to nature and its power, its ability to teach us and how we should respect nature. As opposed to the ocean, or the forest, the desert was a wonderful backdrop to this story.<br />Paulo Coelho speaks of marveling at the beauty all around us, but never forgetting what brought us to the point of appreciating that beauty. He reminds us of how children are so honest, open, and most authentic. Children would be the only ones who know what their dreams are. Yet as children grow, they become concerned with doing \\"what others think they should do,\\" and ultimately live according to someone else's rules, and sacrificing their own dreams.<br />Another habit we lose as we grow, is listening to our hearts. Coelho illustrates so convincingly the importance of knowing yourself, and listening to your heart, thus the answers always reveal themselves to you, be it through your heart, or signs from the world around you.<br />Similar to Homer's \\"Odyssey,\\" Santiago met many characters throughout his journey, all of whom offered something special. I have to say, however, that I really enjoyed The Englishman the most. I think this section of the novel was the most humorous as well. I thought it was funny how the Englishman and Santiago were both essentially working to fulfill their personal legends. The Englishman, however, completely missed the point of his search. He often contradicted himself, never hearing subtle signs around him. He was easily irritable, impatient, focused on texts and formulas, rather than learning from the more intangible concepts. His goal was to learn alchemy literally; turning lead into gold. He was frustrated with the fact that Santiago couldn't understand the scientific complexities of alchemy, whereas \\"the boy\\" was turning out to be the true alchemist, by way of listening to his heart, and the world around him. It was a hilarious parallel actually!<br />Also, I think it's interesting how the author always referred to Santiago as \\"the boy,\\" a student of life, always learning. The character of \\"the Englishman\\" also made me wonder if he was a political reference, citing the English rule of many African territories? Could he have been a satirical reference to \\"the imperialist who was unappreciative of the beauty of the world outside his home?\\" He was described as the educated and knowledgeable one, yet in fact there was so much that he did not know! It seemed like a nice juxtaposition: The Englishman's conquering of the mystery behind alchemy vs. the imperialist quest to conquer more unknown land. However, I should remind myself that all but a few of the characters were nameless. My interpretation is that names were unimportant because the story, the journey, was meant to be applied to every person in the world. But that's another facet I like about \\"The Alchemist.\\" It's open to all sorts of interpretation!<br />It's about evolving from within, moving from ordinary to extraordinary. It's about having the faith in oneself and faith in the world to evolve! The objective is to strive to become better than what we are, and then everything around us will become better, because everything in the world is connected, or \\"one.\\" In a time when we are used to instant-gratification through technology, we've forgotten, or don't even consider the language of the world, the soul of the world, the unspoken language of love and omens. It's so easy to get caught up with the day-to-dayactivities of our lives, \\"The Alchemist\\" is a nice reminder that we, too, can fulfill our personal legends.<br />This novel is so profound, so completely positive, and so very kharmic. It can be applied to pretty much every facet of life! What's even better about it is that it's not hiding behind some lofty, complicated, epic of a novel. It's just a simple story. I highly recommend finding the time to read it all in one sitting. It's only 167 pages so it's not that difficult a task to accomplish!y activities of our lives, \\"The Alchemist\\" is a nice reminder that we, too, can fulfill our personal legends.<br />This novel is so profound, so completely positive, and so very kharmic.

B000002UAR|5.0|What can be written about The Beatles that hasn't already been said? The greatest and most popular band in music history, pioneers in the studio, The Beatles were one of the most innovative and influential bands ever. &quot;Revolver&quot; was a big turning point in their career. Recorded at a time when the group had stopped touring to concentrate more on their work in the studio, The Beatles used new techniques and ideas to produce one of the greatest rock'n'roll albums ever made. <br />  The album starts with Harrison's &quot;Taxman.&quot; It is an excellent song, and it shows his superb abilities as a songwriter, which hadn't been previously used very much in the band. McCartney plays the fuzzy guitar solo. The next song, Paul's &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot; is a beautiful ballad complete with  soaring strings. Lennon's songs on the album include &quot;I'm Only Sleeping,&quot; the clever &quot;Doctor Robert&quot; and the finale &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows,&quot; a journey into the psychedelic mind using innovative studio techniques including a backwards guitar solo. Ringo sings the inventive &quot;Yellow Submarine.&quot; Harrison's Indian music-inspired &quot;Love You To&quot; is another highlight of the album. This album truly shows the great minds The Beatles had.
0316666343|5.0|Although the subject matter of this book is hard to take (the murder of a child), Sebold does an incredible job of creating a Heaven where the deceased are still an active part of the living.  This book was beautifully written and very creative in its approach to the afterlife.
0671510991|5.0|Henry Kissinger is many things, that is for sure.  But one thing he definitely is, is a brilliant elucidator of history.  In this book, published in 1994, Kissinger sets before himself nothing less than the task of reviewing the entire history of western diplomacy from the Peace of Westphalia, which ended the bloody Thirty Years War and essentially established the idea of the modern nation state to the Post Cold War order, just emerging as this book went to press.<br />One can disagree with Kissinger over some of the conclusions he reaches yet fully appreciate his grasp of the complexity of the relationship between states.  Kissinger describes, in considerable detail, the changing and evolving relationship between the states of Europe and the changing and evolving American role.  The book begins with a chapter describing the competing approaches of Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson to American foreign policy.  Roosevelt was a classic believer in \\"Raison Detate\\" a French term meaning pursuit of state interest.  Wilson promoted a universal policy based on morality.  As Kissinger demonstrates, every American administration since Wilson has pursued some form of Wilsonian diplomacy based on American exceptionalism.  Prior to Roosevelt, the United States stood almost completely aloof from the diplomacy of the Old World, confining itself to pursuing a Europe free Western Hemisphere and trade relations.<br />Kissinger demonstrates how the aftermath of the Napoleonic wars led to a new international order in Europe based on the balance of power.  The whole purpose behind the \\"concert of Europe\\" system was to ensure that no state became too powerful.  Kissinger looks at the differences of each of the European powers and how they pursued their interests and how this pursuit ultimately led to disaster in the twentieth century.  Britain tried to stand apart from European alliances, seeing its interests in having the world's most powerful navy and ensuring that no European land power became too dominant.  As Kissinger shows, morality never entered into the equation.  Britain went to war with France when Napoleon became too powerful and later clashed with the other powers for the same reason.  France, stunted after the defeat of Napoleon engaged in a policy designed to regain its influence as the dominant land power of Europe, a policy it pursues to this day according to Kissinger.  Russia is shown to be expansionist to its core and Kissinger argues convincingly that Soviet designs on Eastern Europe were simply an extension of Tsarist policy.  Germany, once unified in 1870 by the machinations of Bismarck was ultimately bound to run afoul of both Britain and France due to its potential strength and size.  Indeed, it was Germany's emergence as a unified and powerful nationalist force that made the tragedies of the 20th century inevitable.  Skillful and complex diplomacy by Bismarck staved off the coming catastrophe, his unwise successors and the myopic Kaiser who fired him were unable to pursue, or even understand, Bismarck's dual strategy of increasing German influence while maintaining the balance of power.<br />Kissinger is clearly at his best when describing the breakdown of the complicated alliance system that led to the catastrophe of the First World War.  He also is adept at explaining the flaws inherent in the treaty of Versailles that made World War II inevitable.  Finally, the book arrives at the aftermath of  the War, when the United States, with its disdain for balance of power diplomacy and its determination to halt Soviet/communist aggression, became the major player on the world scene.  Whichever the administration, all viewed the Cold War, not as an assertion of American national interest but as the promotion of international morality.  As Kissinger shows, this is the hallmark of American diplomacy.<br />Since Kissinger himself was a major player on the world scene during the years from 1969 through 1976 and so his discussion of this era requires a delicate balancing act and may engender controversy.  I feel that, on the whole, Kissinger avoids being overly defensive as he describes and defends the policy of the Nixon administration.  Others may feel his views as stated in this book might not fully coincide with his actions as the chief foreign policy architect of the Nixon and Ford administrations.  When it comes to Vietnam, Kissinger makes a strong case that Nixon was a victim of a national situation that was beyond his control.  He argues convincingly that Hanoi itself is responsible for extending the war to Cambodia.  He ignores, however, the illegal action the Nixon administration took by lying to Congress.  Nevertheless, this is a book on statecraft not a memoir of Nixon's Vietnam policy so these lapses are forgivable.  Kissinger shows quite convincingly, the many obstacles laid by Hanoi and the American Left to reaching a settlement in Vietnam.  In the end, of course, the settlement reached broke down after a mere two years and so the United States was utterly defeated.  This demands an answer to the question of whether the United States gained anything by refusing to abandon the effort in 1968 when Kissinger claims the administration knew South Vietnam's survival was virtually impossible.  Kissinger also defends the Nixon's administration's policy of detente while giving fair time to detente's detractors.  He winds up the book with a look at the end of the Cold War, the collapse of the Soviet Union and the emergence of a new world order.  He presciently closes the book by stating that it is not yet clear whether the next international challenge will come from a strengthening China or militant Islam.  <br /> Henry Kissinger is a polarizing figure disdained by many.  The hard left views him as a war criminal.  The right views him as alternatively a defeatist or an international chess player, lacking the morality they demand in American foreign policy.  One thing that is beyond denial, however, is that he is a brilliant historian and teacher of the nuances of international diplomacy.  Any fair minded person will relish his book.

I was hooked immediately even though the book was just incredibly sad I couldn't tear myself away and stayed up teary eyed until 1 AM to read it in one sitting.  The story, the characters, the situation(s) were all compelling and developed with such detail it makes your heart ache. The only reason I don't give it Five Stars is that the subject matter is so hard to deal with and although I found some solace, overall it didn't leave me feeing better at the end.  I highly recommend the book if you want/need the outlet that reading a modern day tragedy will bring.

B00006IU73|4.0|In the first few moments of Porcupine Tree's major label debut, I found myself afraid that the band had forsaken its traditional sound for something else.  But \\"Blackest Eyes\\" quickly settled into more familiar territory.  The rest of In Absentia followed.<br />Similar to previous efforts, Stupid Dream and Lightbulb Sun, In Absentia showcases the songwriting ability and musical talents of Steve Wilson and crew.  The music is atmospheric with soaring guitars, excellent bass and keyboard work, and huge drums.  As usual, vocal harmonies are plentiful.<br />There is a slightly harder edge to some of the songs and a greater sense of whimsy in a few instances but these elements add to, not distract from, the overall focus of the album.  All-in-all, this is another great album from Porcupine Tree.
B000050XEI|1.0|I'am probably going to get about 20 non helpful votes for this review,but I just want to tell you the truth,if you die-hard Enya fans think you can handle it.This type of music called New Age is the most absolute worst type of music out there.It is nothing more than boring sound,sometimes boring sounds with humming type singing that is more impossible to understand than most Death Metal lyrics.Enya is a perfect example of boring sounds mixed with humming type singing.The songs on this CD,just like on any other New Age CD,can very easily put you to sleep.These songs are lame,boring,and totally useless.If you are looking for true female talent,check out Khia's new single My Neck My Back(uncenscored version).Most of you will vote this review not helpful,but I am just telling nothing but the truth.
B00006IX0R|5.0|A good starting point for anyone who enjoys the Cranberries tracks that they have heard on the radio.  If you listen to the entire cd, you will most likely find that you become a fan of the band.  If you can, rent the dvd &quot;Live In Paris&quot;, an excellent performance.  Then you will appreciate the talent level of the artist in this band.  You will most likely wind up looking to aquire the artist entire collection of work.
B00005JL96|5.0|Here we have one of the funniest, most creative and original, and genuinely emotional animated films that has EVER been created, and this pretentious \\"Watchman-on-the-Wall\\" person has the nerve to put it down for elements that don't even figure into it.  \\"Lilo & Stitch\\" is the only movie I have ever seen that makes me cry literally from beginning to end; half the time because it's just that charming and funny, and the other half the time because the themes of love, loyalty, and family are SO beautifully and tenderly conveyed.  Right from the film's opening credits sequence you will surely have tears in your eyes from the sheer beauty of the Hawaiian musical numbers and the open affection of the filmmakers for the Hawaiian culture.  On a character note, Lilo has perhaps more depth than any animated character I've ever seen.  Her eccentricities and emotional baggage make her, by turns, delightfully charming and totally heartbreaking.  Stitch is, hands-down, the most original and entertaining animated character I have EVER seen, and so long as he is on the screen, I am having the BEST time with all of his fantastically wonderful random movements and noises.  \\"Lilo & Stitch\\" also deserves kudos for having the courage to be so modern in its handling of such important real-life issues as broken familes and Departments of Child Welfare.  This is an absolutely brilliant and deeply moving little film that deserves FAR better than the lazy, cheesy direct-to-video sequel and TV series that are already in the works, and my only wish at this point is that Disney would treat their finest properties with enough reverence and respect to give them the better-thought-out *theatrical* sequel treatment they so strongly deserve.  I may not pay much attention to the forthcoming direct-to-video \\"Stitch: The Movie,\\" but \\"Lilo & Stitch\\" is one movie that I personally cannot WAIT to add to my personal DVD collection... it has entertained and moved me more thoroughly than any other movie I have had the privelige of seeing this year!  Happy viewing, one and all!!
B00000064G|5.0|Have you seen that Volkswagon commercial where those college looking co-eds look like their going on a road trip at night, and then lay on the roof of their car and look up at the stars. Well if you have, you probably did , or didn't now that Nick Drake's 'Pink Moon' was playing in the background. 'Pink Moon' was Drake's last album; originally forgotten by  mainstream music fans, is now a testament to what a true artist is. <br />You could listen to this recording 1000 times in a row and not get tired of it, and probably hear something different everytime. The album itself is a melancholy, moody, sort of naive triumph. <br />Although Drake's premature death of an overdose of antidepressants took down a genius in his prime, we still have his great recordings; such as 'Pink Moon', and just wonder, what if.

0316153826|4.0|The second in the Bosch series is not one of my favorites by Mr. Connelly, and I think it's because, to me, it's too easily figured out, so the element of surprise is not present.  I also found some of the dialogue a little more wooden than usual, and once again, Harry falls in love at first sight.<br />However, those things aside, Connelly thrusts Harry into a labyrinth of deception, greed, murder, leading him across the border to Mexico.<br />Bosch is certainly to be admired in his pursuit of justice at the risk of his own job.  Sometimes, it's frustrating for me that Harry seems to focus on nothing but his desires and his wishes.  He doesn't seem happy with his job, so why does he stay in it?  Wouldn't he be better off as a private investigator.  He has no friends, and it's because he's such a lone wolf.<br />Now that I've sounded off about that, I will continue to finish the Bosch series, as Connelly is a skillful writer.  This just isn't one of my favorites.<br />RECOMMENDED, THOUGH.
0385505833|4.0|This story reminded me very much of \\"The Vinyl Cafe\\" by Stuart McLean, with a somewhat normal family suddenly in the midst of an unusual situation with funny undertones.<br />A nice young couple sees off their only child who is leaving to join the Peace Corps in Peru for two years. The father, a tax accountant, starts thinking of the upcoming holidays, with all the money and stress that go along with it. Realising what Christmas costs, he and hid wife decide to skip Christmas this year and go off on a cruise instead.<br />The story revolves around the preparations for the trip, but mostly at the incredulousness of everyone in their neighbourhood who can't believe someone can actually skip over Christmas. And then they receive an unexpected phone call on Christmas Eve...<br />A very quick read, just the thing to get you (not) started on your holiday shopping this year.

B000002U9Y|5.0|This album is the Floyd's second greatest creation(their greatest being &quot;Piper&quot;). More heavily influenced by Syd than most people think, this album is The Pink Floyd when they were truly experimental and pcycadelic. It is a work by a band not afraid to venture a little beyond the realms of normal human experience.
6305428522|5.0|Although not a reason this movie is so good, I would like to begin by stating that as a graduate of Ouachita Baptist University of Arkadelphia, Arkansas, I believe this is the only movie ever made that mentions Arkadelphia. And not just once, but twice!<br />There are many, many reasons this movie succeeds so marvelously, but I would like to focus on three.<br />First, this movie benefits from an exceedingly fine cast. Not merely the leads, but many of the lesser roles are filled with extremely good actors and actresses. While Ralph Fiennes, John Tuturro, and Rob Morrow all shine in the leads, lesser parts are filled with people like David Paymer, Hank Azaria, Mira Sorvino, and Martin Scorsese. I was especially impressed by the always superb but underutilized Paul Scofield (who won the Oscar portraying Thomas More in A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS). He seems the very embodiment of the man of reason, erudition, and courtesy portraying Mark van Doren, and his pain upon learning his beloved son has lost his teaching position at Columbia is one of the great poignant moments in the film. Look very carefully at the scene where several attractive coeds interrupt Ralph Fiennes and Rob Morrow and you will spot Calista Flockhart (a.k.a. Ally McBeal).<br />A second reason this film succeeds so well is its tremendous period feel. The movie looks and feels like the late 1950s at every second. QUIZ SHOW does a great job of [pulling] you in and giving you an almost tangible sense of time and place.<br />Finally, the movie is easily one of the most accurate historical films I have ever seen, although drama is never sacrificed for the mere sake of being accurate. If one has done any reading about the scandals or perhaps if one remembers the events, the film constantly impresses with the amount of accurate detail it contains. Too often when watching a movie dealing with historical events, one can become irritated of the events are inaccurately portrayed. For instance, although LAWRENCE OF ARABIA is a truly great movie, Peter O'Toole was nearly a foot taller than the real T. E. Lawrence, which is a huge problem, since Lawrence's self-consciousness about his short stature was a major factor in his self-image. There are no such moments such as this in QUIZ SHOW.<br />But if you watch, or rewatch, this film, please note those references to Arkadelphia! My undergraduate hometown!ABIA is a truly great movie, Peter O'Toole was nearly a foot taller than the real T. E.

B000069AUI|2.0|Fans of Coldplay (and there are now many) ask why the band doesn't get the free reign to take themselves as seriously as Radiohead do.  There are two main reasons for this.  First off, Radiohead did the whole New Age male Britpop thing first, and as such they get away with more than they probably should (and with Amnesiac, maybe way more).  Only Radiohead gets to be Radiohead, regardless of whether or not that's fair.  Second, and more importantly, is that Radiohead has proven in the past that they can absolutely, without a doubt, rock your face off.  This is something Coldplay has never done.  While songs like \\"High and Dry\\" and \\"Fake Plastic Trees\\" served as Radiohead's launching pad to explore new sounds, Chris Martin and his band have used the approach of those songs as their overall sonic blueprint.  It's pretty, to be sure.  But they seem capable of so much more.<br />So it's really a matter of taste that will determine if A Rush of Blood to the Head is your cup of tea.  Its filled with some downright lovely songs, from the opening drone of \\"Politik\\" and down through \\"Amsterdam.\\"  All the songs are expertly produced, and it easily tops the soul-crushing earnestness of Coldplay's last effort, Parachutes.  Still, this album has the feeling of a buildup to something that never happens.  Somehow, Coldplay manage to be quiet even when they're playing at their loudest.  The band never cuts loose, and the spotless production ends up betraying them as a result.  Because something begins to dawn on you as you listen to A Rush of Blood to the Head: Coldplay have never written a real, live ROCK song.  They seem more like modern balladeers, creating these lovely, sensitive pieces that are too cold to be accessible.  Bands write great ballads as the occasional step down from their hard rocking ways, but Coldplay have nothing to step down from.  They only seem to exist in first gear, and that's the problem with A Rush of Blood to the Head.  By the time you get to \\"Clocks\\" and \\"Daylight,\\" two wonderful, more optimistic songs right in the middle of the album lineup, you expect Coldplay to continue building up to something more.  But they don't.  They shift back down to songs like \\"A Whisper,\\" a song that's, well, a whisper.  It's like Martin and Co. are struggling to hold their emotions in check when they should be letting it all hang out.  And the end result is a mild dissatisfaction on the part of the listener.  It seems the name Coldplay is too fitting, because this is a band that can be difficult to warm up to.<br />But again, it's all a matter of taste.  If you're looking for a mellow, quiet album that won't bother you, then this is for you.  But fans of bigger, louder rock will need more than what Coldplay is willing to give right now.  Maybe if you slip the boys a beer or two, they'd be more willing to get their hands dirty.  <br />(Note: If you're looking for bands with Coldplay's ballad skills but some extra guitar juice, try Ash or Doves.  Their new albums outdo this latest Coldplay effort.)

B00005N7Z1|5.0|Robocop works on every level.<br />As satire, it really hits the mark. Unfortunately, because it mainly satirizies American media, movies and society in general (and self-criticism tends to go over our heads), this film was dismissed as a mere \\"blockbuster\\" in it's day, and halloween costume fodder. But it's so much easier to \\"get it\\" now, isn't it? <br />As a black comedy, it really hits the mark. I first saw this when I was 8 years old and I don't think I even cracked a smile. Now I \\"get\\" Verhoeven's sense of humor. Baby food, toxic waste guy, \\"I'll buy that for a dollar!\\", ED-209 falling down the stairs, morons shooting up cars with ridiculously oversized guns...<br />As an action flick, it really hits the mark. There's action and lots of it and most of it is brilliantly scripted. The final showdown at the steel mill is one of the most palpably exciting, well-scripted and thrilling sequences ever filmed. No, I'm not exaggerating. <br />As drama, it also hits the mark. Even though we find out about Murphy mostly in brief flashbacks and the first 10 minutes of the film, we are given enough to sympathize with the character, as he's getting \\"crucified\\", after he's \\"resurrected\\" and when he's pacing back and fourth and glances at the sleeping Lewis knowing full well he can never \\"have\\" her.<br />Notice the cleverest damn product placement in the history of cinema. Take that, Gerber Baby!<br />15 years, two sequels, dozens of imitation \\"cyborg\\" movies, thousands of products and halloween costumes later and Robocop still shines.
0790725657|5.0|This movie is a favorite of mine, my daughters, my mothers, my sisters, my nephews, and my best friend. It is very charming and can teach even the youngest child about kindness and creativity. That it is what is inside that counts, that you can survive anything if you believe in yourself. In this movie, Sara's mind is a very powerful thing. This movie is funny, sad, and inspirational. This is my second copy, we wore out the first.
0060934719|5.0|Having read a couple of Neil Gaiman's previous novels, I wasn't sure about picking up Stardust---I've always admired his writing, but I'm not into the horrific---but I'm very glad I did. It's a quieter fantasy, intricate, charming (in the old sense), resonant with intimations of myth and legend, striking some very deep chords of memory---or something like memory. Eerie. Odd. Numinous. It reminds me somewhat of Peter Beagle's The Last Unicorn, in its austere, antique simplicity of plot combined with unexpected and unclich&eacute;d twists of magic.<br />A deceptively-simple tale: in early Victorian days, a young man has a brief-but-life-turning experience at the once-every- nine-years Market at the town of Wall,which is one of the very last places in this world where the realm of Faerie can be accessed. Many years later his son makes his own way to Faerie, pursuing a fallen star and a secret destiny.<br />And it all comes down to: just simply wonderful, full of wonders,  and some of it quite funny, commenting on Victorian mores and the endlessly-rehashed genre of the fairy story itself. I prefer the regular novel to the graphic novel, myself, because I like to make up the story's pictures in my own head...
6304346107|5.0|The 1980's and 1990's produced a number of outstanding movie and TV productions of books by Jane Austen, but this is my favorite adaptation of any Jane Austen novel.  All of the main characters are appealing and well cast. The story line from the novel, and the dialogue from the novel, are followed closely.  The generally upbeat tone of the book, which is much of its charm, is preserved.  It's hard to say how this was all accomplished in a 2-hour movie, while in the case of other productions of other Jane Austen novels, a mini-series did not seem enough to do the book justice.  <br />I saw this production of Emma with minor expectations, having heard nothing about it.  Evidently the abundance of Jane Austen adaptations - including 3 or 4 of Emma alone within the span of a few years - kept this one from becoming well known.  It would be nice to see this one released to theatres again should there be a return of the same type of interest in Jane Austen productions that was seen in the 1990's.
B000002H97|5.0|This album demonstrates the darker emotions of mankind with good, devastating effect.  In contrast to previous productions from Metallica, this one is mature, controlled and tightly structured.  Their melancholy chords and tones produce very good artistic effect.  The signature driving sound of the rhythm and lead guitars are there, but they place them in a proper musical structure instead of the previous technical displays of virtuosity like And Justice For All; this is true artwork.  For the fresh ear not accustomed to the rough guitars, it might take two or three listenings to get used to it.  Once one understands the music, one can fully understand the messages within with piercing effect.  In most of the songs, there is brewing of powerful emotions similar to frustration; then there are the climatic explosions of this pent up energy into musical form.  There is anger, frustration, bitterness, loneliness, and stubborn defiance.  All these emotions brew for a while, and then explode.  There is an undercurrent of religion in this album: it appears that the darker side of some faith was pierced, the illusions are gone, and the light turned to darkness.<br />Enter Sandman is a song about nightmares.  In the background, there are always rumblings of horror.  There are explosions throughout the song with the effect of terror.  Holier Than Thou appears to me a shout against the hypocrisy of certain people with religious pretensions.  The words are very good and the rhythm drives very fast and violent.  The Unforgiven will probably serve as this album's best song.  It is the story of a child entering life that is subdued as a \\"whipping boy\\" and bitterly learns the rules of those around him.  He never got the chance to \\"shine\\" like he was born to do; he will never see what \\"could have been\\" had he been allowed to \\"shine.\\"  He now looks at others who subdued him and tells them that they are \\"Unforgiven.\\"  Wherever I May Roam is the song of a person constantly on the go.  He is a savvy fellow, tough, defiant, and fiercely independent of society or anyone else.  He has a lust for the road - a lust for traveling to seemingly dark places in a dark world.  Nothing Else Matters is a smooth, slow, and very melancholy song.  A young man is disgusted with the world.  He cannot trust anyone.  Now he vows to trust in himself alone, and nothing else matters.  Of Wolf And Man is a comparison of men with wolves.  There is the lust for the independence of the wild, the lust for danger, the lust for roaming the earth.  When listening to this one, I sometimes feel like it is an expression of the old American Indians and their love of hunting and being in the wild.  That wild world is dark, though, as the song demonstrates.  The God That Failed demonstrates the shattering of innocent illusions of the various \\"gods\\" everyone has.  Their most poetic line is, \\"The healing hand held back by the deepened nail.\\"  This line sends shudders down my spine every time I hear it.  Those are some of the highlights.<br />This is probably the best Hard Rock album ever produced.  The chords are there, the dark emotions are there, and the talent is there.  I am not sure these guys knew how good this album was when they produced it.  It has been 11 years since its release, and it is hard to get tired of it.  This album casts a magical spell on people.

0425163407|3.0|This is a somewhat interesting, Dr. Kay Scarpetta mystery, replete with its usual attention to forensic detail, as well as a myriad of subplots. Though not her best novel, it still manages to entertain the reader.<br /><br />Once again, Dr. Scarpetta, Chief Medical Examiner, finds herself on the hunt for a serial killer, when the body of an elderly, dismembered woman is discovered in a Virginia landfill. Moreover, a mutated, high tech, variant small pox virus appears to be on the loose, and Dr. Scarpetta finds herself receiving taunting emails from the alleged killer, signing as \\"deadoc\\". Couple all this with an overly ambitious and unscrupulous law enforcement agent named Percy Ring who arrests an obviously innocent man for the elderly woman's death, and the reader has an intriguing mystery to unravel.<br /><br />Homicide Detective Pete Marino is pivotol to the success of this book. His relationship and repartee with Dr. Scarpetta contribute to many of the book's highlights, and it is he who gives dimension to the book, as he is simply a wonderful, down to earth character. Dr. Scarpetta's relationship with FBI Agent Wesley Benton is less memorable, as he is on the periphery of the story, for the most part, though in the end he provides closure for the torch Dr. Scarpetta was carrying for her ex-lover, Mark.<br /><br />The only real fly in the ointment, however, is the continued appearance of Dr. Scarpetta's niece, Lucy, who is an obnoxious character. In the real world, Lucy would not be allowed to hold the position of responsibility that she does in the book, due to her compete immaturity. She is a loose cannon waitng to misfire at any moment. It flies in the face of her professionalism that Dr. Scarpetta seems unable to fathom this, but blood is thicker than water.<br /><br />The ending is somewhat surprising, though in retrospect, the clues are, in fact, there for the reader to discern the identity of the killer. The problem is that the resolution occurs almost too abruptly, as if the author had only a limited number of pages in which to wrap it all up. While the book moves somewhat slowly for the most part, the last few chapters move at lightning speed. A better editing job may have helped make this book into a more cohesive, better written mystery. Still, Kay Scarpetta fans will find something to enjoy in this offering.oo abruptly, as if the author had only a limited number of pages in which to wrap it all up.

0446608955|5.0|It was as if someone had reached down to the depths of my heart and made me feel. Let me tell you, very few books have ever any impact on me as this one had. The classic tale of two teens falling in love and at the last moment loseing to a fatal accedent. Nicholas Sparks has truly captured what it ment to fall in love. I'm only 15 and when i see love that's all i can picture. A perfect soulmate for the rest of your life. But the understandings of reality in this book showed me that there is not always teh happy ending. It was a book that you loved and hated at the same time. i recently bought it for my friend. He explained to me that his feelings and they were the exact feelings i felt. This is one of the greatest novels i've ever read. I read a book a week and this one will always be with me. I think reading this book even made me mature alittle. i'm highyl recommend it.

B000023VR6|5.0|First off, let me just say that Dr. Dre is the God of all Rap.  Without him, the genre of music as we know it, would be nothing.  With that said, it should be obvious that this CD will blow you away.  From its opening to closing seconds, 2001 delivers PURE beats, and HARDCORE lyrics.  This CD just keeps on going, and if you are any kind of rap fan at all, you wont even THINK about pressing the skip button.  My personal favorite tracks are &quot;Still D.R.E,&quot; and &quot;Bang Bang.&quot;  If you have never bought a Dre CD before, get this one.  You will not be dissappointed.
B00005B6NC|4.0|PITCH BLACK is a rare horror movie which defies the horror formula. As is essential with most creature features, although PITCH BLACK is not about the creatures, you're always wondering and speculating about the deaths of the characters: choosing which ones look like prime meat and which ones you're rooting for. PITCH BLACK throws those expectations out the window, until the very last death, which is shocking in its choice. David Twohy certainly makes us think twice about trusting our expectations. Another formula contraption is also thrown out the window as most horror films seem to make victims out of its black characters, but again, PITCH BLACK defies convention with its fine performance by Keith David (from REQUIEM FOR A DREAM).<br />Twohy creates a barren landscape for which the characters to live and die. Massive skeletons like those of mammoths litter the desert, which is blinding during the day, but when the eclipse plunges everything into darkness, the darkness itself becomes a character, and Twohy is adept at manipulating it. When the creatures do appear, ashen and skeleton-looking themselves, the effect is gripping.<br />A few characters hold surprises: Cole Hauser's addicted cop, the little \\"boy\\" who wears a great disguise. I love the interaction between Vin Diesel and the androgynous head-shaved \\"boy.\\" You can already see where I'm going with this one. Radha Mitchell's performance is affecting, but Vin Diesel steals the show, long before he got the deal to drive fast cars in THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS or play superspy in XXX. He's charismatic, smarmy, bombastic, vulnerable, manipulative, and hateful sometimes, but you keep rooting for him.<br />In the end, I was disappointed by one character's death, but that is to say, I wasn't expecting it, and my jaw dropped when it happened, but anything that foregoes the typical formula, made fun of by such movies like SCARY MOVIE, is fine by me.
B000002UWF|5.0|Louis Prima and his rollicking crew of wife, Keely Smith, Saxaphonist Sam Butera and the Witnesses were the number one act in Vegas in the late 1950s.  This is high energy, humorous music in a style of...well...Dixieland jazz with an Italian accent?  <br />Some of the songs start out slow and tender, but they don't stay that way.  Prima's gravel voice and trumpet and Butera's saxophone quickly convert all tunes into hard-driving swing.  Cherokee-Irish Keely Smith has a sweet simple voice and her duets with Louis on songs like &quot;That Ol' Black Magic&quot; are outstanding. <br />This is music that's gotta make you a little happier than you are.  Missing on this CD, however, is one of Louis's best numbers: the show-stopper from Disney's animated movie, &quot;The Jungle Book.&quot;  And Keely's solo &quot;The Sunny Side of the Street&quot;-- in my humble opinion, the best ever rendition of this song -- isn't here either.  Too bad, but nothing is ever perfect.

This is slow, lifeless and lacking any punch. Whats with the symphony junk on this album? This never works. But beyond that, there arent any interesting songs. Ok, I'll say there are 3 decent tracks but on a stronger album, they'd be filler at best. Maybe Beck feels dull and lifeless these days and if thats the case, he's succeeded in putting it in song. It doesnt make for an interesting listen though.

However, this is really scarcely an issue, because in this case the good outweighs the bad to such an extent that one has to make a conscious effort to remember that the latter even exists.  Track after brilliant track, there is an absolute embarrassment of riches here.  'Time' and 'Hang Down Your Head' are perhaps Waits' best ballads; 'Clap Hands,' 'Jockey Full of Bourbon,' and 'Diamonds and Gold' are pitch-perfect examples of the twistedly evocative, surreal Waits song; and for all-out exultant dementia, it doesn't get much better than 'Cemetary Polka,' 'Tango 'Til They're Sore,' and the magnificent title track.  And that's just for starters.<br />I do apologize for using so many superlatives here, but the fact is, this is one of the all-time greats.  It may take a while for newcomers to acclimate themselves to Waits' inimitable style, but once you have, it seems almost inconceivable that you will not be filled with the desire to own everything the man's ever recorded.  Or perhaps that's just me.  Still, twenty-some CDs later, I don't regret a minute of it.  Rain Dogs is, to use a too-shopworn but nonetheless entirely applicable phrase, a must-buy.
B000002UJQ|5.0|People try to make perfect albums, but this one hits the nail on the head. Not one note is out of place, and all of the songs are classics. Everyone else here named all the good things about this album, so I can't say anything that others haven't, so I'm just adding to the praise that Radiohead deserves. This is the &quot;classic album&quot; of this generation if this one has any. My personal favorite is Kid A, but when it comes to this album, this is a very close 2nd, but I relate more to the alienation of Kid A than this. Everyone should give this at least 5 stars.
B000068TPN|5.0|I really wasn't sure what to expect with Mel Gibson playing this type of role.  I should have known better.  Mel Gibson's portrayal of Hal Moore is absolutely the best.  He shows that in order to be a true leader you must put your men first and always have their best interests at heart.  Moore/Gibson shows that he truly cared for his men and contrary to a &quot;by the book&quot; leader, he took a very personal interest in getting them all home.  They were his responsibility and he made sure that he was the first person in harms way and the last person to get to safety.  <BR>     Kind of funny...in a way this is a love story, not about the kind of love between a man and a woman but rather about the love comrades in arms have for each other, the kind of love only they can truly understand.  Warriors don't fight for flags or countries, or ideals...they fight for their buddies.  Worth every penny.
B000000HTK|5.0|A masterpiece of epic proportions.  This band was something else.  Peter Hammill is a lyrical genius.  Only Peter Gabriel can compare in that regard.  This album is dark yet soothing, crushing yet uplifting.  Captivating at every moment.  All the way to the brilliant ending.  Complex music, complex lyrics...excellent playing...very inspired sounding...<BR>All of the instruments sound great.  The percussion is is especially fantastic.<BR>It still blows me away.  Ten years after I first heard it, its allure hasn't diminished a bit.  Incredible.  I'd give it 1000 stars if I could.<BR>Powerful stuff!
B00000099Y|5.0|Each Tool album is better than the one before, and Aenima is no exception. Tool fans will love the luring lull of Maynard's voice as it drags them into complex rhythyms. These guys are true masters of music on all levels. Metal heads, alternative junkies, and fans of music genius alike will love this CD, love its hard-driving songs and its pensive, guilty lyrics. And bonus points for the hologram!
0694003611|5.0|Every baby should have this book! It's got the rhythm and repetition that babies love. It is a great way to say Good Night to the day and move on to bedtime. It helped me create a very nice bedtime routine (...). What's best about this book is that I enjoy reading to my baby every night. Very pleasant!
B00006J3T4|4.0|Mark Knopfler's latest CD is a folksy foray into his seemingly undending love of music with American roots.  It opens with the boldly rugged \\"Why Aye Man\\", a spirited documentary-in-song on the plight of North-Eastern European refugees traveling to Germany for work.  The heady seriousness of this opening piece is enough to propel the record forward through lighter, more poetic songs, like \\"Devil Baby\\", \\"A Place Where We Used To Live\\", \\"You Don't Know You're Born\\", and the title track.  <br />    Knopfler keeps his classy acoustic guitar skills alive throughout the CD, though they are aimed at expressing a working class sentiment.  This is complimented by lyrics like \\"You don't want no stand-by pair/'cos these'll take the wear and tear/made to take good care of you/for that trip by road or rail\\" But while the earthy mood and calloused theme are refreshing, I can't help but yearn for more of what Mr. Knopfler is famous for: classic electric guitar playing.  \\"Coyote\\" gives a rare sample of this talent, but not enough to feed hungry ears.  \\"The Ragpicker's Dream\\" is certainly not for enthusiasts of Knopfler's firey finger-picking.  But it is for those who enjoy a good story in a song.<BR>                         - B. Molinelli
B000069CWE|4.0|Juding by the title is not what captured my attention for this album. I figured (as many others did), wow a re-mix, just a cheap effortless way for Linkin Park to exploit their fame and stall off the release of their next album while making some more bank. Then I downloaded the re-mix of One Step Closer...the urine dripped onto the floor after having wet myself from the sheer musical innovation applied to the song. It was a perfect blend of guitar laced techno with the original lyrics and vocals with sublime uprisings of the original melody. In short the song felt like and sounded like musical genious. <BR>        I then continued to download more of the songs found on the album until I deemed it \\"buyworthy\\" (which it certainly is). In fact I have come to find these surprisingly original re-mixes in more cases than not better than the originals; now perhaps that is because Linkin park has become SOOOOOO over played within the recent years past, but any how I found this album to be worth the money and this is somming from a guy whos support and interest for the Linkin Park sound was waning to the point of non existence. If anything you will find the sound a refreshing break from the mainstream sound that Linkin Park has become a part of. Just listen.
0451450523|5.0|The movie for this book has been my favorite as far back as I can remember, and when I found the book at a used book store one day, I HAD to buy it.  One of the things that shocked me the most was how similar the story was to the movie.  Except for a small part left out because the kids to watch the movie wouldn't probably understand it, the book and movie were almost exactly the same.  As I read the book, I could hear the characters from the movie speaking.  <br />This book is great in its attention to the little details that actually put you in a world where unicorns must exist.  The way the author describes everything is so vivid and exact that you can see everything clearly and you can actually believe that in a place like that, unicorns must exist.  Though it is a tale of the human spirit and emotions, etc., what I find to be really wonderful is the way the story lifts your spirits.  It's an absolutely beautiful book, and the movie captures that very well.  I'm looking forward to the new movie, but I'm not sure if it'll work as well, though I have heard that they did get some of the original voices to play parts in the movie.  <BR>Join with me and petition to get the DVD released in Canada.
0783229526|3.0|The main thought that kept occurring to me while watching &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot; was: IS there ANY movie that could translate Hunter S. Thompson's book to the screen in a satisfying way?<br />And I don't think there is.  It's also just as difficult to re-create an acid trip on film.  And Terry Gilliam tries very hard to accomplish both of these impossible tasks. (is it any wonder that Gilliam's has been trying for YEARS to film &quot;Don Quixote&quot; for???).  <br />Gilliam throws EVERYTHING into the mix.  He starts with the kitchen sink and then moves into the basement and the garage.  And as a result, the movie is polarizing: people are either going to love it or hate it.  From scene to scene, my opinion goes up and down.  But the bottom line is -- as long as there are bongs, dormrooms and undergraduates: Pink Floyd will never stop selling albums and this movie will always have an audience.  <br />For a Hunter Thompson fan, there are things to love in this film.  It looks incredible: bright and shiny as a new red shark, with a production design that must've taken an army to assemble.<BR>And Johnny Depp and Benecio Del Toro completely nail their roles.  They BECOME Ralph Steadman's illustrations with performances that go all the way and then some -- at times, watching this movie was literally like seeing the images from the book projected directly on-screen.  Although it's a bit funny that Johnny Depp tries so hard to recreate Thompson's sprawling crab-like walk -- Thompson walks like that because he's 6'4 and long-legged... and Depp is, well, less strapping. That's a quibble, of course; Benecio Del Toro put on 60 pounds for this part, but Depp can't exactly gain height -- he did shave his head, though.<br />On the other hand, the movie is too all over the place to be completely successful.  The tone changes drastically on a regular basis, plunging from screwball comedy to somber message to disgusting regurgitation to sly social commentary to vicious anger, then moving off in another dozen different directions.  By the time Raoul Duke flashes back to San Francisco in the 60's (and the Youngbloods are hauled out to provide their oft-used historical/musical cue with &quot;Get Together&quot;), you will believe a movie can have 120 different personalities in just under 2 hours.  <br />Which is not to say I don't like this film.  You can't love it, but it's hard to completely dislike, and I find myself dropping it into my player every six months or so and skipping to favorite scenes (the wild, confusing opening; the Circus Circus fiasco; the elevator stand-off).  Personally, I always thought that, instead of making &quot;Natural Born Killers,&quot; Oliver Stone should've tackled Las Vegas (using the same cinematic techniques and Kelsey Grammar as Raoul Duke, but saying that always makes people look at me funny) but Stone didn't do it (and probably would've made an equally problematic movie) so this is the film that was made.  It may leak noxious fluids onto my carpet whenever it's on my TV, but... it has a certain charm, nonetheless.
B000003BEV|3.0|Their Satanic Majesties Request was released on Dec 8, 1967, for the first time simultaneously in both the UK and US and with the same tracks.  This issue is from the Stones ABCKO catalog (which includes all the early Decca/London material).<br />There are a number of interesting things about the album:<BR>.....the title is a parody of the \\"Her Britannic Majesty requests\\" on British passports<BR>.....it was the 1st album to use a 3D photograph (by Michael Cooper, shot in Mt. Vernon, NY)<BR>.....Lennon & McCartney sang backup on \\"Sing This Altogether\\"<BR>.....Jagger wrote \\"2000 Light Years From Home\\" in his cell at Brixton Prison<BR>.....We Love You and Dandelion were on the acetate but were removed just before pressing began<BR>.....the album received the worst reviews of any Stones album and is still considered by many to be their poorest work<br />My opinion matches Bill Wyman's......there are 30 seconds of Bill snoring during the sessions between In Another Land and 2000 Man.<br />ABCKO acquired the Stones' catalog after Allen Klein became their manager in 1965.  The resulting legal battles produced releases that the Stones opposed (they took out full page adds asking fans not to buy them), including the controversial Metamorphosis releases (which are now available on CD for the 1st time ever).  But the sad fact is that the Stones lost control of their great early material.<br />The tracks were recorded between May and Sep 1967 at Olympic Studios, London as follows:<BR>May 18, 1967<BR>.....She's A Rainbow<BR>Jun 8, 1967<BR>.....Citadel<BR>Jul 7-22, 1967<BR>.....In Another Land<BR>.....Sing This Altogether<BR>.....Sing This Altogether (See What Happens)<BR>.....The Lantern<BR>.....On With The Show<BR>Aug 10-30, Sep 1-7, 1967<BR>.....Gomper<BR>.....2000 Light Years From Home<BR>.....2000 Man<br />This information comes from \\"It's Only Rock And Roll: The Ultimate Guide To The Rolling Stones\\" by Karnbach and Bernson and from my own collection.
B00006J3WH|5.0|This cd is awesome. All the lyrics are in here, which is great. There are scenes in the episode where songs are cut, or overlapped, and all that is gone on this sondtrack. It's the complete song, an it sounds better because they got rid of the little action sounds. There is the best song on here, and it is called, &quot;Sacrifice.&quot; This is the song, it was used in the season finale of the fifth season. It's when Buffy sacrifces herself to save Dawn, and the world. The simple piano notes leave an impression, and it reminds you of how great Buffy is. Get this Album!!
0743201140|4.0|The strength of the book is that it puts you on the track of knowing yourself. It helps you understand the basic inclinations, the unique perspective that makes you who you are. These are general indications of how your mind functions and how these talents or instincts can be converted to strengths to create synergy in your life.<br />But these &quot;significant themes&quot;, as the authors refer to them are not the complete answer. Firstly, I believe, going by the nuances of feelings and tendencies that humans possess, it is partially appropriate, if not incorrect, to categorize their strengths in such a fashion. To really understand one's strengths in fine detail and to use them, one must go through some finer observation over a period of time. Also, though there are discussions in the book about successful people being where they are due to their strengths, there ought to be some discussion about the process of honing  individual talents too.
B00005JKDQ|4.0|Here is a fun animated feature sure to appeal to the kid in us all. Furry Sully and his one-eyed friend Mike work at Monsters Inc, a company devoted to scaring the lving daylights out of humans. One day a little girl named Boo manages to enter their world through her closet, and it is up to Mike and Sully to find the correct door in the factory to return her home. The only problem is Sully finds himself becoming very attached to her. Features terrific voice performances by Billy Crystal as Mike and John Goodman as Sully, some of it may be a bit scary for very young kids, but MONSTERS INC is perfect family entertainment, with humor that will appeal to adults as well.
B00005UW7V|3.0|It was supposed to be Stanley Kubrick's lifetime achievement, his masterwork.  Steven Spielberg took over after the legendary director died in 1999.  &quot;A.I.-Artificial Intelligence&quot; is a visually stunning but somehow tasteless film.<BR>The story is basically a futuristic Pinnochio.  The film follows David (Haley Joel Osment) a robot programmed to give and receive love.  After his human family abandons him, David sets out to discover who he really is.  He meets Gigolo Joe (Jude Law),a fellow robot, and they travel to the &quot;end of the earth&quot;--actually a flooded Manhattan--where David will hopefully find out his meaning in life.<BR>The film is heaven to the eyes, as I stated earlier, but it lacks something.  Director Spielberg does a marlvelous job, but the ending it too warm-hearted to be considered good.  The score by John Williams and the special effects are excellent.  <BR>In all, &quot;A.I.-Artificial Intelligence&quot; is worth buying.  It's an interesting look into the possible future, and certainly its story will dazzle children and adults alike.
0553106635|5.0|Yes!  I agree ASoIaF is better than The Lord of the Rings.  I've read LoR and ASoIaF twice each.  Martin has created a detailed, rich world full of history and tradition that rivals the LoR.  And what I like best is that he does not make his characters invincible and is not afraid to let them die.  The only problem is that I can't wait for the next book and all others pale in comparison.
B000066NW0|2.0|The answer should be obvious. A two-letter word: NO. In a previous review I wrongfully stated how Avril was a breath of fresh air. Since then, I came to my senses of how bad her music is. There's no ifs ands of buts, it's just BAD!! Her punk image is misunderstood & has sadly fooled the majority of teens in America. Let me weep. Meanwhile, I'll get to the songs. As you can see, I gave this album two stars rather than one. Why? you may ask. Read on. I'll get to the \\"punk image\\" later. Oh, and before little Avril fans scroll down & immediantly vote me \\"no\\", hear me out. I know what I'm talking about, & I have my reasons.<br />\\"Let Go\\" starts out with an (not good but) average hard-rock track called \\"Losing Grip\\". It has some catchy guitars and good lyrics so, I'll say it's sub-par. Next is the vastly boring, drawling, tiresome, repetitive, OVERPLAYED (I could describe it in 100 words, but if I had to choose one I'd choose that) 1st single \\"Complicated\\". There's nothing very interesting about it except for the \\"catchy at first listen, then you're hooked\\" and the fact that it's a fun summer song, I guess. But nothing more and very forgettable with it's 3rd grade lyrics (\\"You try to be cool/You look like a fool to me\\"--Avril are you talking about yourself?). Now, comes the absolute PIT of the album, the miserable 2nd single \\"Sk8er Boi\\". The track is strangely spelled, as a part of Avril's never ending quest to be \\"cool\\" or different. Hmmmmmm. Anyway, the whole track is pretty wack. The lyrics are even more stupid and juvenile than \\"Complicated\\". (\\"We are in love/Haven't you heard?/How we rock each other's world!\\") It has obnoxious, self-centered lyrics and annoying guitars. It couldn't be worse. Moving on to the soft-rock song called \\"I'm With You\\". It has deeper lyrics, that at least have meaning. You can tell this is mostly professionally crafted. Again, not great, but tolerable. <BR>Tracks 5 & 6 (\\"Mobile\\" and \\"Unwanted\\") are just too onoxious, I won't bother. Again, here we have soft rock with \\"Tomorrow\\". Prob my fav off the album. The rest is just horrible, with the annoying contradicting-myself tracks (\\"Nobody's Fool\\" and \\"Anything But Ordinary\\") and the exception of \\"My World\\" which is easy for me to relate to. The rest is just bad. Sorry.<br />Now, I'm going to make this quick, because no one wants to hear me drawl on. Her image is fake. TOTALLY COMPLETELY 100% FAKE. Again, sorry, it's the truth. All of it. The fake tatoos, ties, bad hair, sideways baseball caps. Oh, and she doesn't play guitar. Her band does. She's sadly misunderstood. I'm out!<br />I gave this two stars. It deserves 1 & 1/2. One, for the tracks I like (\\"Tomorrow\\", \\"I'm With You\\", \\"Losing Grip\\", & \\"My World\\".) The other half for the help she did in trying co-write her tracks. Maybe, just maybe, in the midst of all the mayhem she posses a slim amount of talent.
B00006J3WH|5.0|Joss Whedon is amazing!  How he wrote the lyrics and the music for all of these songs, I will never know.  He truly deserved an Emmy for that episode.<br />If you're a fan of Buffy, this cd is a must-have.  If you're not a fan of Buffy, pick it up anyway...it's very enjoyable!  The songs range from hard rock to zippy show tunes.<br />They lyrics are funny and the singing really amazed me!  Who knew that Spike(James Marsters), Tara(Amber Benson), and Anya(Emma Caulfield) could sing so well?!  Giles(Anthony Stewart Head)was a given as he had sung before.<br />Why do bunnies &quot;need such good eyesight, anyway&quot;?  hmmm...
B00006J3WH|5.0|Obviously, this CD isn't for everyone. It's meant for fans of the show and/or people who appreciate musicals. Anyone who enjoys this sort of thing, however, will not be disappointed. The songs are very catchy and the lyrics are often amusing. Aside from the musical's songs, there are also some scores at the end from other critically acclaimed episodes and they're excellent as well. You can see the scenes playing out as you listen to them. The cover art alone is almost worth buying the CD. This is something \\"Buffy\\" fans must own. As usual, Joss Whedon has given us another excellent piece of work.
B00003CXI1|5.0|Finally a movie that shows in a great way the story of a so sold book....<BR>I like very much the whole saga so that I waited for this movie since i began reading: well i'm waiting for the second now. <BR>I advise the DVD not to the kids only(you can also read the books to your kids etc) , cause it's a story that makes you dream and it's, in my opinion, a very nice escape to everyday's life....

B00006JIAF|5.0|I went ahead and bought this limited edition 2-pack. Since I don't have MTV2, and therefore never get to see these videos, I figured it was a good deal. And I'm glad I got it! The videos look even better on DVD, and the two performances from MTV's $2 Bill show are nice to have. So buy this special edition release and pass your original CD on to someone who doesn't have it yet!
B00004T9UH|4.0|Excellent music, lyrics and feel to the songs - one problem: POORLY edited. This is not a real clean version - words such as \\"f@ggot\\", \\"b!tch\\" and even \\"pi$$\\" and \\"$hit\\" are left in.<br />Excellent songs let down by a bad job at making a clean version.
B0000025RI|5.0|My favourite album in my collection, Thriller is, in my opinion, Jackson's best ever contribution. Beat It is a brilliant song and Billie Jean is smooth. Wanna Be Startin' Somethin' is a very catchy song that's almost irressistable to dance to. Plus, softer tunes like Human Nature and The Girl is Mine add more flavour and appeal to the album. This is the biggest selling album of all time, with various songs off this album still played in nightclubs, some twenty years after their initial release! Thriller album is the best!
B000056V73|5.0|This movie is a must to view more than once--there are nuances that might be missed with the first viewing.  Though the subject is set decades ago, Almost Famous has a fresh, 21st century slant to it.  The scene in the plane is just too hilarious to describe!
0060930187|5.0|Although I don't relate to this book as much as I thought I would, I honestly thought it was mind blowing. Sylvia Plath's story gripped me so much that at points i cried whilst reading it. Normally when i finish reading a book I am very opinionated about it, but this one leaves me speechless, I just don't know what to think. I've never read anything quite like it. It wonderfully describes the slow yet sudden descent into depression
B000002KOJ|5.0|I've often said that The Beatles were the geniuses of rock, but it was more of a collective genius with George Martin included. They fed off of each other's individual muse. Joni Mitchell, however, is a genius that stands on her own. Her music and lyrics meld into a seamless, living, breathing whole - taking on a magical essence that's greater than the sum of its parts. And those parts are some of the most brilliantly advanced and artful musings you will find in popular music.<br />\\"Clouds\\" (1969) is a fabulous collection of songs, and one of my favorite albums. It begins with \\"Tin Angel,\\" about someone (Joni?) with memories of a past love who finds another with a soul as sad as her own. The verses are in a minor mode, so minor-infused they're practically mournful. When she gets to the last line of each chorus, \\"I found someone to love today,\\" her minor guitar chords still amble, even right through the word \\"love,\\" but finally resolve to major as she sings \\"to-day\\" (and even then there seems to be some hesitation as the chord smiles briefly). The song is pure magic. \\"Chelsea Morning\\" awakens us out of the gloom with a burst of sunlight - rhythmically bright, filled with hope and anticipation:<br />\\"Woke up, it was a Chelsea morning, and the first thing that I knew<br />There was milk and toast and honey and a bowl of oranges, too<br />And the sun poured in like butterscotch and stuck to all my  SENSES<br />Oh, won't you stay<br />We'll put on the day<br />And we'll talk in present TENSES\\"<br />How can I not be moved? The entire album seduces me. Her meaningful lyrics are veritable stories one can become lost in, filled with thought-provoking relevance. The music supports her storytelling, bursting with sensual richness. The sound of her voice alone makes me swoon. I can only describe her vocal harmonies on \\"The Gallery\\" as heavenly. On \\"Songs To Aging Children Come,\\" her lyrics, melodies and chords all soar to celestial heights while the rhythms of her guitar keep the whole thing anchored. One could depict this - like much of the album - as at once both cosmic and earthy. Her unaccompanied vocal on \\"The Fiddle and the Drum\\" can give me a lump in my throat, but that's no matter, since the concluding \\"Both Sides, Now\\" (which ranks among the most intoxicatingly gorgeous songs I know), is a song that can reduce me to tears.<br />Joni Mitchell is a genius in the truest sense of the word. She is an artist of the highest order. Words often elude me when attempting to describe what I feel when I listen to her music. She reaches deep inside of me - and I'm never quite the same after listening to one of her albums. If you are new to Joni Mitchell, I suggest starting with \\"Clouds\\" or \\"Song to a Seagull.\\" Get to know her through these two, then continue on.<br />Cheers,<br />Murrayhing anchored.

0767835255|5.0|Air Force One was release in 1997.  The approximate run time is 124 minutes.<BR>Harrison Ford, Glen Close, Gary Oldman, and Wendy Crewson star in this radiant production.<BR>Directed by Wolfgang Petersen.<BR>Color<BR>Genre - Drama<br />The President of the USA goes to Moscow and gives a stirring speech outlining the USA's new \\"Zero-tolerance\\" policy with respect to terrorism.  On the flight home, terrorists take over Air Force One (the President's official indestructible plane) and take the passengers including his wife and daughter hostage. The terrorists plan to execute one hostage every half-hour unless/until their demands are met. However, the President is a former Medal of Honor winner, so the terrorists are in for a surprise.  He manages to deploy the escape pod empty.  After searching through luggage to locate his cell phone, he calls the White House.  The operator does not believe the president is calling so he convinces her to trace the call.  This is a hilarious scene.  While receiving instruction as to how to connect wires to release fuel, the battery on the cellular phone goes dead.  The terrorists kill people with the speaker on so that the other hostages can hear.  It is very nerve wrecking and keeps you on the end of your seat.  After managing to get in the room where his staff is, he discovers the terrorist have his wife and daughter with them.  He has an idea but in order for the hostages to be able to parachute off he must communicate to the White House to lower the altitude to 15,000 when refueling.  One of his staff suggests sending a fax since fax lines are separate from the phone lines and could easily be overlooked.  Not sure as to whether or not the message was communicated, the hostages prepare to parachute off of the plane.  Once the terrorists realize what is happened, they capture the president and put a gun to his daughter's head.  Suspense fills the air; you can hardly stand to watch.  He starts counting, 1...2, and the president can'tstand it anymore.  He gives in to the terrorist and calls to request the release of the General.  The terrorist admits he lied and does not plan to release the president nor his family.  You see the look on Harrison Ford's face, and know he is not only mad but not going to put up with this.  While being tortured and beaten, the president manages to pick up a piece of glass to use to free himself.  He recovers Air Force One just in time to stop the release of the General.  Not only does he not have a pilot to fly the plane but also due to the damage to the engines Air Force One is not able to land.  The rescue mission begins with a cable connecting from one plane to the other.  His family is safe but there is only time for one more person. The question is will the president escape or will the American on Russia's side interfere?  This is a must see movie.

B00005JKNF|3.0|I like period pieces, however I found this one confusing, slow, and tedious. If it were not for the find performances of Maggie Smith, Kelley MacDonald, and Helen Mirran, this film would've wasted my time. A British game of Clue gets caught up in its own dialogue. As the movie explains difference between the classes. I must be missing something.
B0000640SA|4.0|This movie is still one of the most creative movies I've ever seen and the DVD is great to own. I just wish the menus were not so damn misleading and confusing. Sure, they might be fun the first time but not after that.<br />If you liked the movie you really need to own this version of it!
B000066NW0|5.0|This is one album you can count on to bring quality.  Unlike the typical album, this one has 13 great songs.  It shows with already two songs in play on the radio.  I can't beliee this girl has so much insight into life.
B00006F7S4|4.0|I'm not a Beck fan.  I've never owned an album of his.  But I heard somewhere that Beck was working with my favorite band Radiohead's producer Nigel Godrich(sp?) so I thought I'd check it out.  I was blown away by what I heard.  Not to say that a Radiohead fan is guaranteed to like it, but it is damn good.
B0000542D2|1.0|This is one of my top ten favorite movies of all time.  I have been waiting since last summer when I relived this classic in the theater for this release.  What a shame the result is the biggest train wreck of a DVD to come out in the last five years.  Here are the problems as you will notice them:<br />1.  The cover is stupid.  It looks like a variation on Let it Be wrapped in tin foil.  Don't mess with a clssic...<br />2.  The \\"extras\\":  two discs and no outtakes, commercials, trailers?  ...didn't there you used to be a great little collage thing w/ \\"Things we said today\\" on the VHS tape that played right before the credits start?  I loved that thing and yet its nowhere to be found here.  I haven't watched the interviews yet so I can't comment on what is actually here.<br />3.  The sound:  Too much bass in the 5.1 remixes of the songs.  Why no option for a stereo mix or the origanl mono?  The dialouge sounds great but the music made me adjust my sub.<br />The transfer is great...
B000067DNC|4.0|These DVD's are great.  The only thing they don't have is sufficient extra material.  There are only 2 interviews and other little snippits, but that's it.  Compared to the European DVD's these are practically bare bones versions.  Also, there is no subtitles for English which I miss.
B0000009S3|5.0|I bought this album only after I was surprised to find two of it's peices in my &quot;Real Book&quot; (The &quot;Real Book&quot; is a book that gathered together hundreds of Jazz standards-A standard is a jazz classic- and is known, and probably used, by jazz musicians.). It was my first Zappa expirience, and I loved it. Of course I've learned how to play the standards. The fact that they are in the book means that someone, somewhere, the mysterious figure that edit the &quot;Real Book&quot;, found that this music is serious and good enough to be considered a jazz classic. I agree. The two peices- The great &quot;Peaches En Regilla&quot; and the very very cool &quot;Son of Mr. Green Genes&quot; are truly good peices of music. The album is fun to listen to, and, if you are a musician, fun to play.
B000069AUI|4.0|Everyone talks about how hard it was going to be for them to live up to Parachutes.  I think they managed to do that.  The album is good and has some great tracks like Politik, Clocks, Green Eyes.  But I don't really feel they went anywhere new.  Perhaps the vocals are a little less moaning and crying, but I'd be more interested if they'd challenged themselves a bit more.  That said i give this album 4 stars.  Buy it.
B00005YW4H|4.0|When I heard the first release,(Don't know why) I was absolutly amazed. Then I learned Norah was a 22 year-old piano major from Texas. What?!!   Every time I listen to this awesome collection of music, I'm see myself in a comfortable, smokey piano bar watching a breathtaking talent singing about the same way I feel. Norah is a tell it like it is, natural entertainer, who has a gift for soothing the mind and soul. The arrangment is fluid, a bit redundant, but if you want to be relaxed, and listen to an angel tell her tale, get this cd. Norah, like fine wine, will only get better with age. I'd love to see her live. I believe she would show us her true prowess, free to play and sing how she sees fit. She gets my vote for this year's best new TRUE talent.
B00000IQW0|4.0|I also remember watching the original 3 hour (with commercials) pilot episode - which had been interrupted by news of a peace treaty being signed - in late 1978. I already had models of the Colonial Viper and the Cylons' fighter. Although the materials on the DVD suggest otherwise, this DVD is the movie version which was released one year later in Sensurround. I remember seeing the movie AFTER the series had started. (The DVD states the movie became the pilot.) I have never seen any video release of the complete pilot. It's always been this movie version. The pilot is now only shown as a three part episode in reruns. It would be nice to see more of the series on DVD. <br />It's been years since I've seen the complete pilot, but I'm guessing about 20 minutes might have been cut to make the movie version. The scene that stands out the most is Jane Seymour's character actually giving a TV news report. In the movie, you simply see her holding a microphone looking for her son. The DVD extras mention her character being a reporter, but unless you see that microphone, you'd have no clue what her career was before the Cylon attack. <br />The story begins with a peace treaty about to be signed between the human colonies and the Cylons. (Until just now, I never thought about the plot and the fact a real treaty was signed during the original broadcast.) The promise of peace is used to lure the humans into a trap - destroying most of the colonies and all but two Battlestars. (The second Battlestar pops up in a later episode in the TV series.) The survivors get together and begin a journey to where they believe an additional human colony exists. ...so they head for Earth. <br />The special effects are almost as good as those of the original Star Wars. (Dykstra was involved with both.) The story is well written. However, in some ways, it looks like it was made for TV. Many of the places look like sets - the brightly lit casino, the mines. The design of the Cylon warriors is great. The Cylons themselves (like the leader) aren't as impressive. The term &quot;Cylon&quot; is used to describe the lizard-like race as well as their robotic warriors. <br />Stu Philips' music is above average. It's better than his music for Buck Rogers in the 25th Century. It's not on the level of John Williams, but it's still enjoyable. I do have the LP of the soundtrack. <br />Battlestar Galactica was a great series I enjoyed when I was 9, and this movie does bring back memories. Until Universal releases more of the series, this is all we have on DVD. Besides the more famous stars like Lorne Greene and Jane Seymour, we also have Dirk Benedict who would later star in The A-Team.
B00005QY5Y|2.0|As a huge fan of his previous record, &quot;Heartbreaker&quot;, I found &quot;Gold&quot; to be a big disappointment.  It seems as though Adams is trying to wow us with his prolific songwriting,  but I think we would rather hear better songs than lots.  The edgy excitement and soulful, raw emotion of &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; are not evident on this record.  It sounds like too many music biz producers got together to make a homogenous, easily digested alt/pop record.  Nothing new, exciting or interesting here.  But it will probably sell well and get him on MTV, and it sounds like that's what he is after.
6305546789|5.0|It's true what they say about the original, it's always better then the sequels which is very true. Halloween is the most original, scary, real-life horror movie of our time. The plot about the baby sitter and all her friends being stalked and killed on halloween night is the most scary I've ever heard of. Jamie Lee Curtis is great as the young Laurie Strode,and Donald Pleasence is great as the ultra-obsessed Sam Lomis. Michael Myers will go down as the scariest villian of all time.
B00006DEFA|5.0|When I first saw Amadeus in the fall of 1984, I was mesmerized by it. It was one of those rare instances where the director had seemed to capture magic on film. So I went back and saw it again. And again, and again. Fourteen times in all, before it was pulled off the big screen and relegated to the awful, colorless, washed-out, pan-n-scan VHS tape we had to make due with for the next decade. Still I didn't mind. I watched that tape so many times, I finally wore it out. Something definitely went right with \\"Amadeus\\": the perfect blend of the best people in every department, from the best music ever composed, to the superb acting from all players, the great script, costuming, right down to craft service, I would imagine. Of course, when I heard the \\"Director's Cut\\" was out in theaters, I went immediately. I don't know what happened, but the print I saw was dirty and scratched, with several bad splices, and the sound was so loud, I had a splitting headache by the one-hour mark. Also, having seen the original cut so many times, I found the restored footage to be very jarring, and thought it interrupted the pacing. Needless to say, I only saw that cut once on the big screen. However, I just finished watching the new DVD, and I must say all my misgivings are gone. The clarity of the picture and the incredible soundtrack just blew me away. For some reason, the new inserts appear more seemless here (or maybe I knew when to expect them), and some of them actually improve the film. Constanze's character is allowed to develop in these added scenes, making her more sympathetic and more real. By contrast, Salieri is even more despicable than before. Several bits of dialogue tacked on to existing scenes could have been left out since they add little to the film aside from length, but adding the new footage does absolutely nothing to diminish the magic of this truly great film. It's got a couple really nice extras, too: a \\"making of\\" featurette, and a commentary track (which, if I'm not mistaken, is actually portions of the laser disc commentary with some new bits added--someone may prove me wrong on that, but I think I'm right.) And unlike the laser disc or the previous DVD, you don't have to flip it over in the middle! Believe me, don't bother renting this DVD; you'll want to own it. Anyone who hasn't seen Amadeus, and thinks that a three-hour drama about two composers from the eighteenth century might be boring, is in for a pleasant surprise when they see this DVD. At times hilarious, at others poignant, and always filled with the music of Mozart, this movie is fun and entertaining from start to finish, and looks, sounds, and feels brand new--surely not 18 years old. I give it my highest recommendation!'m not mistaken, is actually portions of the laser disc commentary with some new bits added--someone may prove me wrong on that, but I think I'm right.)

B000002IP1|4.0|Sometimes in life, there is a album that really speaks out about the times in our society. From the worlds of Grunge, to the early cases of MTV in the front of our minds, with music videos from Madonna and Billy Idol. Then, there are some of the other albums, that let the music speak for itself. In that case, Phil Collins proved that case with his entire solo career, and his career with Genesis.<br />His 1989 album, But Seriously.., is still one of the most simple and understanding albums I've ever heard. The music from this album, is just as strong as you could expect. Each song tells a different story either about love, or about a important issue in society. That case came with Phil's mega-hit, Another Day In Paradise, which was #1 for four weeks on the charts. That would be one of five Top 40 songs Collins would earn from this album. Other songs like, Do You Remember?, Something Happened On The Way To Heaven, and All Of My Life, still showcase that state in the front of mind.<br />While many people don't think of Phil Collins music today, it will always remain in the hearts of millions of serious fans, that prove that the music speaks for itself, and speaks of a generation of the time as well.
B00001QGPR|3.0|Bowie's problem these days is he can't get used to getting on in life. Still siring children, squiring super models, becoming the internet and, all the while, purporting to retaining footing on the leading edge of the artistic world (mates with Moby, you know), all this in his fifties ... it isn't a modus operandi I'd follow to retain my dignity if I were him.<br />But, with a pleasing showing at Glastonbury last year, and now this record and (to an extent) the more recent Heathen, maybe the signs are there that Bowie's finally preparing to reach for the pipe and slippers.<br />Not before time.<br />Finally, a record with no complicated double-album length concept art murders to tax your credulity (per 1. Outside); no drum machines played back at 78 rpm to have you groping for the Tylenol (per Earthling); no peroxided quiffs, china girls, red shoes, glass spiders, screaming lord Byrons, hobgoblin kings, pet shop boys remixes - nothing like that. Just updated middle rock, contemporarily produced nice tunes and lyrics of a nostalgic bent. The nearest thing I can put it to is the more straightforward (and hence less interesting) parts of The Buddha of Suburbia.<br />And that's exactly the problem. It just isn't all that interesting. Despite what the papers said, it is not Hunky Dory (nothing like it, in fact) and, unless you lock yourself in, it'll be over before you realise it and you'll have wandered off to do something round the house, or started reading the paper, it's that engaging.<br />Basically, it's cafe music. That's quite an indictment, so I qualify it by saying it would be a *nice* cafe, one sophisticated enough to deliberately not own the Gypsy Kings or Simply Red, but still cafe music all the same.<br />Sorry, David.
B00006J3WH|5.0|I have to say as a Buffy Fan for the past 7 years, I was happily shocked and enthralled by the episode of OMWF... And now to have a copy on CD is really incredible... The show's quirky humor coupled with Joss' lyrical talent for conveying every emotion his characters feel, bring this catchy musical to life.  All the cast members put themselves out there and shine; giving their 100% to an art form that is difficult to say the least.  Songs are poignant, funny, and dramatic.  Some stand outs are- well the whole darn thing.  I love all the major songs-  cast, crew, and Joss deserve more than just a round of applause.  It's a shame this episode didn't get the emmy it deserves.  The added perks of the instrumentals are really great- brings you back to those haunting moments in &quot;Hush,&quot; &quot;The Gift,&quot; and &quot;Restless.&quot;  Owning this cd is essential, if you are a true Buffy Fan.  Great Fun, Great Work, Incredible Talent!!
B00004ZAV3|4.0|A few among the hundreds of reviews posted about this disc have been downright obtuse, particularly those wondering why particular Beatle favorites didn't make the cut. (Duh! The title is &quot;1.&quot; So if it wasn't a #1 hit on either the U.S. or U.K. pop charts, it's not included in this collection. End of story--and yeah, I've got a few dozen favorites of my own that aren't on this disc.) However, I have to side with some of the folks who acknowledge that the presentation is not the greatest, even if some of the songs in this collection are. The remastering can be a bit harsh and unforgiving, depending on the tolerances of your equipment; I've decided that the whole set sounds best on a good-quality portable player with better-quality headphones, rather than higher-rez components. (There's a splice in &quot;She Loves You&quot; which is pretty nasty.) It's a pity that they decided to go with the &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; soundtrack mix of &quot;All You Need is Love,&quot; which sounds a little wimpy (and fades out about 10 seconds sooner) compared to the mix contained on the &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; LP (and the original single). And yes it is, it's true that the all-hits format doesn't always show the Fab Four at their most inspired. Liner notes with a little more historical information would've been a help, too.<br />But... it's 79 minutes of The Beatles in better-sounding digital remasters than the terrible mid-'80s transfers which I hope will soon be retired in favor of a complete refurbishment, a la the Stones catalog on ABKCO. Especially for those who weren't around to hear it first-hand (I'm 42 now, so &quot;Love Me Do&quot; WAS a little before my time, or at least predated my ability to comprehend what I was hearing,) this set does illustrate the band's progress over the amazingly brief eight-year span of its existence. And you know that can't be bad.
B00006AFUR|5.0|I first saw 30 Seconds to Mars at an Incubus concert.  At first a bunch of people were still wandering around the surronding concert area when 30STM showed up (not many people were interested in the opening band).  After they started playing however, everyone flocked to their seats because they realized that these guys were good.  As another reviewer wrote, they are the real thing.  I came back from the concert and realized that 30STM had just started playing on the radio that day.  Believe me, they are gonna hit off big.  You should buy this CD while it's still [cheap].
0790729725|5.0|Okay this movie has to be one of thee best mafia/gangster/mob movies ever besides Scarface and The Godfather I & II. I'm 16 years old and I love this movie to death. To the kid who was 12/13 or whatever, first of all you should expect that this movie is gonna be somewhat violent with Pesci in it(not that Pesci goes around killing in all of his movies) and if Deniro is in it than you know something is gonna happen(something always does when Deniro is around) but also the rating i mean it was rated R...i mean they dont put the ratings on there just to have em on there so u should have known it was going to be violent....and i do agree that the movie was at its low point when Liotta was on dope but still that also made it a strong point cause that kinda thing happened to hoods but yet no one talks about it.....all in all this is a good movie
B00000I07P|4.0|Slippery When Wet is the album that made Bon Jovi household names throughout the world. Album contains 2 number ones (Bad Name and Prayer), and a top ten smash (Wanted-which is the best song on the album). Other highlights include Wild in the Streets, Let it Rock and Raise Your Hands. Though their most successful albums, not their best.
B00006IU73|5.0|For those who don't have a clue what Porcupine Tree is or sounds like, I'm not really going to try and explain, cause you can read the Amazon review.  I've listened to some Porcupine Tree before, simply due to the fact that their singer/songwriter/who knows what else Steven Wilson produced Opeth's Blackwater Park in 2001.  I'd heard \\"Signify\\" and \\"Stupid Dream\\" before this one, and I wasn't too terribly impressed with them.  Signify just didn't really interest me, and Stupid Dream was extremely pleasant and some of the songs were catchy, but it just sounded like a Radiohead clone with some old prog thrown in for good measure.  \\"Stupid Dream\\" was good enough to make me buy this one, and the fact that I'd heard there were some Opeth influences thrown into the mix and also the 10 dollar cost of it also helped my decision.  Anyway, the first time I listened to this cd, I was just blown away by how good it was.  It is a lot harder-edged than Stupid Dream, and there is more song variety.  The Opeth influences aren't TOO obvious, but they are there...the opening distorted riff on \\"Blackest Eyes\\" has an Opeth sound to it (distortion tone wise, at least), and \\"Gravity Eyelids\\" definitely has a \\"The Drapery Falls\\" feeling to it.  The entire album is just excellent, though, with the exception of \\"Strip The Soul.\\"  That song reminds me of \\"Stinkfist\\" by Tool for some reason...it sounds like Tool meets Nine Inch Nails with Scott Weiland doing that megaphone thing for the vocals.  Bad stuff, I think.  I'm sad to see that it's apparently the first single (or at least the video that's included on the multimedia portion of the cd is for a shortened version of it), because I just don't think it's very good.  Maybe the general public would be more impressed by it than anything else off this cd, I'm not sure.  \\"Trains\\" is probably my favorite song, it sort of reminds me of Alice in Chains for some reason, but I'm not sure why.  It's just a really great song and that's pretty much all there is to it.  It's acoustic based, and a lot more organic than most of their music has been in the past.  The songs are mostly very diverse, as well, which is something their last albums seemed to lack (in my opinion). \\"Lips of Ashes\\" is another favorite...it reminds me of Pat Metheny for some reason.  It's very foreign sounding, and very beautiful and haunting.   Basically all the songs are a highlight in some way or another, besides STRIP THE SOUL.  This cd is just very, very highly recommended by me, and if you're into radiohead or progressive rock or even melodic metal you will probably love this.  My other favorite bands are like Opeth, Dark Tranquillity, and Novembre, and I still ate this up...it definitely has wide-reaching appeal.  BUY IT or you'll regret it forever.  If you don't like it, well...you're probably beyond help and deserved to lose the 12 bucks.
B00004Y6Q5|5.0|As you can see below, I already wrote a review for this soundtrack.  However, after seeing both One Hour Photo and the trailer for Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, I had to make a short addition to what I already said.  Mainly, the main theme from this soundtrack (which pops up in almost every track, including Summer Overture, Winter Overture, and perhaps best in Lux Aeterna) is used in BOTH of these movies.  Perhaps that is the biggest compliment that can be given to Clint Mansell and the Kronos Quartet.  How often is it that a score is so brilliant that it is used in two films (one of which is part of the biggest epic trilogy in history) only two years after the original movie it was written for comes out?  That has never happened.  <br />This is the most emotionally powerful score in history.  Peter Jackson knows this, John Williams knows this, anyone who has heard it cannot fail to know this.  You need this music.

B00003CY6M|4.0|When I first saw &quot;Serendipity,&quot; I thought it was a bit skinny.  It lacked depth even for a movie about something pretty ephemeral.  Now, after seeing the directors's commentary and viewing the deleted scenes, I have a pretty good impression of why I felt that way. I believe they started out to make one kind of movie and lost faith in it and turned it into something else.  Instead of a fun, quirky, new ageish film centered on multiple coincidences, they came up with a hodge podge of disconnected ideas including Eugene Levy, Buck Henry and reshoots of the first three scenes in the movie.  I really think it's a shame they couldn't have gone with, and perhaps expanded on their original idea rather than throwing a life preserver out for random comedy, hoping to make the movie funnier.  John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale are terrific in this movie.  The chemistry between them is outstanding.  The movie could have been really good.  As is, it's okay.  The DVD lets us know what we missed.
B00006ADFL|5.0|As we all know, \\"Heavenly Creatures\\" is a brilliant and chilling film. Having said that, I am here to describe the extra ten minutes in this 'uncut' version of the film. Let me first say this: this is not uncut in a ratings-board-controversy sense of the word. This cut of the film is not any more sexually or violently graphic than the original cut. What, then, makes up the new 10 minutes? Not very much. A little more dialogue here, a newly restored subplot there...it's essentially \\"Heavenly Creatures\\" as you already know it, except for with a few trite deleted scenes thrown in. This is still the preferable DVD of this film to own, as it is in widescreen, but the changes to the film will be mildly unnerving to the long-time fan.
B00006DEFA|5.0|This Director's Cut is such a welcome surprise.<br />In 1984 I was hesitant to see this film. Being a historical drama, set in 18th Century cities and costumes, you would think it would be a chatty, dry, and uninspired (not to mention that you might expect everyone to speak in British accents). Amadeus is none of those things. It is an inspired film of intelligence, probing psychological depth, and gripping darkness.<br />I finally saw this film on VHS in 1994, a whole decade after the theatrical release, after all the hype had dissolved.<br />I have been a music student since I was six years old. I've always been such an eclectic person, listening to everything from rock to classical, and absorbing myself in the lives of the great composers (Bach, Mozart, etc.) No other life in musical history is as mysterious as Mozart's, and this film brings his life... well.... back to life.<br />Even with this Director's Cut, you must understand this is a work that is hard to classify as fact or fiction. While we all know Mozart died from a rheumatic fever, after his death rumors **DID** spread of a poisoning by Salieri. The rumor was even believed by Mozart's wife Constanze (accounts of this societal gossip is found in many books of Mozart's biography). Also, when the real-life Antonio Salieri was an old man, he was confined to an asylum, convinced that he did commit the murder (also a prooved biographical fact). This is a fact that seems to remain overlooked. Needless to say, the tale, Amadeus, is only rooted in the rantings of a paranoid, schizophrenic old man, rather than a true-to-life retelling of Mozart's road to his early death. But it does paint the picture of 18th Century Vienna \\"tabloid gossip\\" of Mozart's mysterious downfall.<br />If you do your research, you'll find out about the truth about Mozart's death, who was there at his side, who completed that Requiem Mass, etc. But the movie, is still a treasure. The plot is brilliant, blending fact and fiction (the word\\"fiction\\" is a little iffy) and exemplifies the ongoing debate of the popularly mediocre to the \\"different\\" genius, underestimated and underappreciated during his own time.<br />There is enough fact in this film to call it a historical account (e.g. Mozart's struggle with the Archbishop, domestic tension between Conztanze and her father-in-law, the banning of ballet dancing, Marie Antoinette's growing fear of her people, etc.)<br />Visually, this movie scores a 100% in overall artistic appeal. Filmed in the Czech Republic, you see palaces and streets that have remained unchanged since the time Mozart was alive. Too bad Mozart's native Salzburg and Vienna have visually changed so much over the past couple of centuries. The beautifully preserved Nostitz Theater in the film is even the same theater where Mozart premiered his opera Il Don Giovanni in 1789, arguably the best opera yet written. This opera (and many others) are represented in the film, carefully and masterfully choreographed by Twyla Tharp who tried, very succesfully, to recapture the dances of the 18th Century. Even the opera sets are believably \\"classical.\\" Amadeus is cerainly a treat for the eyes, as well as the ears and mind. <br />The opera house in film where Mozart premiers \\"Die Zauberflote\\" (the famous \\"fainting scene\\") is actually just a masterful reconstruction of an 18th Century theatre built on the LARGEST SOUNDSTAGE IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC. It certainly had a magical outcome.<br />This is not one of those costume films where the actors sound British. The actors speak in North American dilect (with the exception of the actors that play the \\"Court people\\" of course) maximizing the American-viewer appeal. The reason for the different dialects, the producers say, is because in 18th Century Europe, many dialects of one language were prevalent: \\"A West German would never be able to understand an East German.\\" <br />Everything in the film looks just perfect: from the number of candles in the chandeliers, to the wigs, to the music, to the way the people talk. Also, Don't miss the \\"Amadeus: Director's Cut\\" with an additional 20 minutes of original scenes that were cut in 1984. It was in theaters and the DVD should be out soon. It helps make the cause of the feud between Constanze Mozart and Antonio Salieri more lucid. Plus other scenes where the financially ruined Mozart stops a piano lesson-gone-wrong, and then beggs the student's father, a nobleman, for money. Also, the opera sequences are lengthened...The film is a classic.<br />Also note that there is also a Special Edition of this release where you do NOT have to flip to the other side.  It comes with a bonus disc including a documentary on the Making of Amadeus.

038533348X|5.0|My favorite quote from Cat's Cradle by Jonah, our somewhat humble Hoosier narrator.  It is just one among many quotes that you will be itching to write down while reading Vonnegut's blackly fatalistic, yet humorous take on the madness of humanity.  After having read other dystopian, apocalyptic masterpieces such as Brave New World, Fahrenheit 451, and 1984, Cat's Cradle was a break from the monotony that not only makes you laugh, but also makes you think.
B0000542D2|3.0|While I love this movie in any form, I was disappointed from the LACK of any materials we have come to expect from recent dvd's- no theatrical trailer, outtakes, deleted scenes, etc. The interview disc is good, if a little long-winded, but it doesn't make up for the missing materials featuring the band and not everyone around them. I took the inclusion of such materials for granted. My mistake.
0375751513|4.0|Oscar Wilde makes for an enjoyable read with his incessant and undeniable penchant for dry and cutting wit.  He asks the reader to ponder the unsymbiotic dichotomy of beauty and goodness.  Can one possess both while maintaining a clear conscience?<br />As for the irrepressible and intrepidly narcissistic Dorian Gray, \\"I admit that I think that it is better to be beautiful than to be good.\\" The Picture of Dorian Gray is a short work of literature that I read in one day. However, its brevity is due to Wilde's publisher purposefully omitting material at the time that was deemed vile and unprintable. This causes some holes in the story - references made to the many sins Dorian committed along the way to others were left unanswered upon finishing the book. More than a little frustrating. Having said that, I was pleasantly surprised with the Gothic, sordid, and dark themes that Wilde so aptly transcribes. Wilde amuses us with the copious amounts of witty quotable lines from Lord Henry such as, \\"The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it.\\"<br />I found myself writing down clever witticisms constantly as I read the book.  A good read if for nothing else than the unsurpassed wit of Oscar Wilde.
B00003CXPJ|3.0|Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller) is the number one male model in the world and he is a personification of daftness and vanity.  He is exactly what Mugatu (Will Ferrell) wants for his new mission, which is to brainwash someone to assassinate Malaysia's Prime Minister.  Zoolander is a film that actively flirts with the audience through its intentionally dim-witted comments by Zoolander and his colleagues.  The film brings the audience an absurdity that raises above almost everything that has been accomplished before Zoolander.  In the end, everyone should know the description for daftness and vanity.
0385334206|5.0|Vonnegut packs an unforgettable punch in The Breakfast of Champions.  It's a punch that will knock you on your side and make you laugh, but also one that will knock you on your head and make you think.  Vonnegut begs us to have awareness - &quot;the unwavering band of light&quot; that separates us from conformist &quot;fully programmed robots&quot; that comprise the mundane world around us.  Through his wacky, fun, &amp; always zany ride through Midland City, Vonnegut dares us to open our minds to an undiscovered world that few of us seldom visit.  As Vonnegut's alter ego, The Creator of the Universe, so aptly states, &quot;Let others bring order to chaos.  I would bring chaos to order, instead, which I think I have done.&quot;<br />Bravo!
B00005JKNC|5.0|Peter Appleton (Jim Carrey) is a man who is happy with life as he lives it in Hollywood as an up and coming screenwriter.  He is nonchalant about the world until the day he becomes black listed as a communist sympathizer.  This results in him losing everything in his life including his girlfriend.  Peter ends up at a local bar where he gets drunk while pondering his hopeless situation and later leaves to go for a drive along the coast.  The drive ends with a crash and amnesia when he wakes up nearby a small idyllic coastal town.  Majestic is an upbeat drama about friendship, film, love, moral issues, memories, and much more that will entertain and charm the audience.
B00005JKG9|4.0|This is a great film. Unfortunately the DVD version is not the great set it could be.  It is a two disc set but the extras are weak.  The good news is though that the movie is terrific.  Everything about this movie from the writing to the cast works, and works perfectly. This has not just one Willy Loman, but a bunch. The trials of four sad salesmen of dubious real estate and their manager (brilliantly played by Kevin Spacey) are detailed in this wonderful film. Based on David Mamet's own Broadway play, it feels like a play with its simple sets and its intense screenplay. Ed Harris, Jack Lemmon, and Al Pacino are all great in this film, along with a powerful appearance by Alec Baldwin. This is America, the great hustle for a buck story. What will men be driven to do when their backs are against the wall. Thee are no heroes in this movie, but anyone who sees this film becomes a winner. This is a movie worth owning and belongs on any list of essential movies. With better extras I would have given the disc set five stars. The movie, however, is still worth owning.
6304806418|2.0|Really, this DVD looks like a direct laser disc transfer.  I watched this in theaters so I had expected a certain &quot;look&quot;.  Just wasn't there.  Now I have quite a number of DVDs and I know about calibrating the monitor.  This one threw off my settings.  The songs, I think, sound better in stereo.  They sound unnatural in multichannel.<br />There is also the dearth of extras in the DVD.  Not even of the &quot;cast and crew&quot; type.<br />This movie on its own is watchable and collectible enough that it needs a better DVD.
0312265859|1.0|A big disappointment.  I own all Stephany Plum books. I loved the first three. It was downhill since. I am returning this one to the store. It simply is not worth the money.

B000002KHH|5.0|Before the original kings of heavy metal, Black Sabbath, suffered a Ramones-like fate (obscured by the bands who ripped them off), they were stunning the late sixties-early seventies musical wasteland of Beatles bubblegum pop with their industrial guitar-driven swirl of reality. As if their self-titled debut wasn't enough to establish Black Sabbath as an innovative act, 1970's &quot;Paranoid&quot; confirms this with a vengeance.<br />It may be true that, if &quot;Paranoid&quot; had been recorded twenty years later by one of today's less-redeeming metal acts, it would be nothing special. And maybe that's one of the reasons this eight-song album is so fresh--Black Sabbath displays their raw yet tightly arranged wall of hard sound, setting the stage for the metal acts to come (how unfortunate the acts that followed were so bland). Although tracks like 'Hand Of Doom,' 'Rat Salad' and the brilliantly chilling 'Electric Funeral' may appear quite tame by today's standards, they are actually conceptually original and very redeeming musically--when compared to today's offerings, but especially to the radio-friendly pop of Sabbath's day. Tunes about war ('Luke's Wall'), madness (the title track) and the descent into delusion of a dope fiend ('Fairies Wear Boots') are made perfect with burgeoning madman Ozzy Osbourne's maniacal voice, guitar hero Tony Iommi's skill, and the dark rhythms of Geezer Butler and Bill Ward. And of course, there's also the tranquil journey of 'Planet Caravan,' balanced by the infamous guitar riffs of 'Iron Man.'<br />Maybe it is for the better that Black Sabbath was overshadowed by the countless unredeeming metal acts that followed their example--after all, at least it's made us appreciate the brave originality of &quot;Paranoid&quot; even more than we would had it been released today.

B000068OCS|5.0|I love pushing peoples buttons, but I very much *dislike* spreading misinformation. Since my post of September 16, questioning the 1.85:1 aspect ratio of the new MGM DVD release of Koyaanisqatsi, a few people have written in to either contradict me or uphold me. Over the weekend, I sent an e-mail to the Institute for Regional Education in Santa Fe, requesting a first-hand clarification of the matter. I received a reply bright and early this morning (Sept. 30), e-signed by Joe Beirne, Producer, Naqoyqatsi. His reply won't award the blue ribbon in this debate to any one person, but each of us will receive a piece of it to take home. I summarize:<br />1) Koyaanisqatsi was always intended by director Godfrey Reggio, and the cinematographers, to be shown theatrically in 1.85:1 widescreen. This was the way it was shown at its premiere in 1983 at Radio City Music Hall, New York City.<br />2) The decision to create a 1.33:1 Academy aperture (4:3) version was made at the time of the *first telecast* on the grounds that a pan-and-scan approach would yield ludicrous results to the film on typical home sets of the time. Fortunately, the way Koyaanisqatsi was shot, they were able to \\"open up\\" the picture to full-television-screen size 4:3 (1.33:1), and every subsequent home video version was brought out employing that particular ratio.<br />3) With the improvements made in television sets in recent years, chiefly the rise in popularity of widescreen sets and the ability to display widescreen films adequately in the home, the decision was made this time around to take advantage of the new technology and bring out Koyaanisqatsi (and Powaqqatsi) in the aspect ratio in which they were meant to be viewed theatrically in the first place.<br />4) Which is the \\"correct\\" version? On that matter I will let Mr. Beirne himself speak: <br />\\"I don't mean to imply that the 4x3 image in earlier transfers is somehow 'invalid'. I think this way of watching the films is very interesting. It is amark of how carefully crafted were these films that both ratios work very well. However, in no sense is the viewer of the MGM DVDs 'losing' something by watching the films as they are shown as a motion picture, at 1.85, anymore than the audience was 'missing something' watching the premier of KOYAANISQATSI at Radio City Music Hall in 1983.\\"<br />I *hope* that settles this debate? BOTH home video versions of Koyaanisqatsi have the blessing the IRE as being equally valid. One last word from Mr. Beirne:<br />\\"PS The Private issue DVD is no longer available, sorry.\\"<br />(My own PS and \\"last word\\" - I still prefer Koyaanisqatsi in 4:3)
B00006IU73|5.0|PT has very quickly become one of my favorite current bands. I still don't understand why they aren't huge. Beautiful vocals, psychedelic guitar, rich textures, solid arrangements, interesting lyrics, catchy tunes, all wrapped in a very contemporary package. This album is a bit heavier than previous ones, and I am not complaining.  After listening to it more I had to bring it up to five stars!
B000002J09|5.0|...The inclusion of stairway to heaven alone leaves this album at perfection. Since that song is one of the greatest ever written. But then throw in something like black dog, with an amazing guitar line by Page. More amazingly, is that anyone who thinks Plants vocals aren't up to par, SHOULD NOT BE LISTENING TO THIS ALBUM. His vocals are amazing for rock n roll and Led Zeppelin is by far in no way, shape or form, underrated. Go buy this album and listen to one of the best bands in rock n roll history. Finally, there comes a point where ignorance is shown in some of these reviews, take the majorities word on it.
B00006AG5N|5.0|This is such an amazing collection. I was surprised when I found out it was coming out as a single disc. New Elvis fans should start right here! Those who have heard it all before should definitely buy this disc. The fifties tracks sound brilliant. The sixties and seventies tracks have been remixed and sound AWESOME. I've never heard all the nuances in Elvis' singing in &quot;She's Not You&quot; until now. &quot;In The Ghetto&quot; sounds like you're hearing it for the first time. &quot;Burning Love&quot; rocks like you've always wanted it to. Even the 1977 #1 &quot;Way Down&quot; is heard in a much brighter light with the new remix. I could go on and on. Do yourself a favor and buy this album now. If you are new to this music your life will never be the same. If you have been listening to Elvis for years, kick back and let an old friend take you to the heights of vocal ecstasy. I have all the previous reissues of this music as well as all the original records. Believe me, this one is well worth it.<br />Now let's go over a few things from a curiosity standpoint. I don't understand why we have alternate takes of &quot;A Fool Such As I&quot; and &quot;The Wonder Of You&quot;. I believe this must have been a mistake since there is no mention of such in the liner notes. Also if you listen closely to the end of &quot;Hound Dog&quot; there is an audio click. This is not in the master tape. Was this a defect in the mastering process that nobody noticed? If these things are to be corrected on future pressings than this pressing will definitely become more valuable. Finally where is &quot;I Want You, I Need You, I Love You&quot;? This great record was proudly included on RCA's 1987 release &quot;The Number One Hits&quot;. Also on RCA's &quot;The Top Ten Hits&quot; it is listed as having reached number one. Were they wrong then or are they wrong now? Who knows. I suppose that historians can debate for years to come what songs actually made it to number one as there were several different charts used at the time. The bottom line is that Elvis Presley the artist was #1 then, is #1 now (sorry, Kelly Clarkson) and will forever be #1. The legend continues to grow.
B0000542D2|5.0|The most fun 88 minutes in cinematic history.  The Fabs at their fab-best.  The video quality is terrific, the sound fantastic.  All of the add-on stuff is interesting, more or less (the tailor's son??).  One nit - why no outtakes?  There had to be many wonderful moments of missed lines and general cutting up, if not entire scenes deleted for one reason or another (You Can't Do That, for one).  No matter.  Get it.  And frequently gather 'round the telly for a giggle.
B00006J3WH|5.0|This is one amazing CD. Despite the slightly sub-par singing voices of some of the cast, this CD is great. Nicholas Brendon is particularly notable as a guy who clearly can't sing, but manages to sound at least decent when he needs to. And funny, of course.<br />I just love every track on this CD. 'Nuff said.
B000001EKX|4.0|This album serves as a perfect companion piece for Kiss' self-titled debut album.  The band themselves have complained that the production quality of the overall sound may have been too over-driven, but I think this only adds to the character of the material.  One song, \\"Let Me Go, Rock and Roll\\", is a Kiss classic and is, in my opinion, a better song than the band's signature tune, \\"Rock and Roll All Night\\".  It's a very straight-forward rock number in the style of Chuck Berry, but with a decidedly bolder edge.  Lead guitarist Ace Frehley stepped up to the plate on this album, contributing the aggressive \\"Parasite\\", a prophetic precursor to music of bands like Anthrax and Red Hot Chili Peppers - a full twenty years prior.  While another Frehley song, the plodding \\"Strange Ways\\", may tax your patience, a rare collaboration with guitarist/singer Paul Stanley, \\"Comin' Home\\", is a melodic treat.  The song brings to mind what may have happened had Motown signed hard rock bands.  Bassist/singer Gene Simmons brought in many interesting and entertaining songs, including \\"All the Way\\", which has the most infectious chorus on the album.  His unconventional ballad, \\"Goin' Blind\\", with it's bizarre imagery (\\"Little lady, can't you see?  There is nothing more for you and I.  I'm ninety-three and you're sixteen, and I think I'm going blind.\\"), is the album's standout oddity, but in a strangely compelling way.  Simmons carries through his stream-of-consciousness style of lyricism - an inventive style last featured on this very album - on the powerful \\"Watchin' You\\" (\\"Limping as you do, I'm watching you.  And you don't really know, just watching me.\\").  The witchy groove of the song's rythmic structure is a perfect match for these unusual - if voyeuristic - lyrics.  On another note, the eccentric packaging, replete with Japanese imagery on the front cover and a \\"mask\\" combining elements of the band's makeup, suggest much of the atmosphere contained in the music.  Photos of each band member in curious poses add to the intrigue, with Stanley and drummer Peter Criss posing with scantily-clad women, Frehley perched upon a table of electronic gadgets like a mad scientist on a coffee break and Simmons breathing fire with a studded goblet in one hand - each in rarely used costumes.  The union of this packaging and music is about as \\"artsy\\" as one could expect from this band in '74, which is ironic.  Considering how visually stunning the band was, one would expect such experimental graphic design throughout it's career, but this is not the case.  At any rate, it's the music that matters and this album is a great listen - most especially for Kiss fans, but also for anyone with a taste for something different.  With few low points (the aforementioned \\"Strange Ways\\", \\"Mainline\\" and \\"Got to Choose\\"), \\"Hotter Than Hell\\" goes with the debut album \\"Kiss\\" like peanut butter and jelly.  They both taste better when served together.
B00000JZI9|4.0|This movie was made as a tribute to the old westerns of the late forties and fifties, an update to a romantic adventure genre that no longer exists. It is in equal parts, drama, romance, comedy, and western yarn. The plot is more a fixture to allow all of the detours than a serious mind-grabber. All of the actors are good, and one gets the feeling that good will indeed triumph over the evil bad guys pretty handily fairly early in the movie. Directed by Lawrence Kasdan (The Big Chill), the film has a wonderful sense of self-awareness, and the good guys are also quite cool (like the \\"Big Chill\\" crew, no doubt), and display a disarming self-deprecating sense of good humor throughout that while making the film much more enjoyable, makes it more than a little less substantial. Enough said.<br />The cinematography is worth the price of the DVD alone. Shot in the haunting stillness of the New Mexico desert, it could be used as a travelogue for the state.  The color-drenched vistas and forboding browns and golds of the dusty plains add immeasurably to the feel of the film, which is as authentic a remake of the old John Ford or John Wayne type western as I think anyone could make in the last half of the 20th century.  The cast is exemplary, and all of the principals, including Kevein Costner, Danny Glover, Kevin Kline, and Scott Glenn are terrific here. So is John Cleese (of Monty Python fame) and a string of strong supporting actors.  The horseplay is admirable, the gunplay seemingly realistic, and the bad guy body count high but not terribly bloody. Great stuff for a rainy Sunday afternoon! Ride away, partner, this one's mine. Enjoy!

0783233477|5.0|A film that faces the issue of death head-on does not sound like a very appetizing or appealing subject for Hollywood to bring the big budget approach to, yet in this wonderful remake of an older black and white classic, \\"Death Takes A Holiday\\" Director Martin Brest does exactly that, serving up both Sir Anthony Hopkins as the befuddled and yet self-important mortal suddenly confronted with the knowledge of his own imminent demise, and a winsome Brad Pitt as Death himself.  Of course, the lovely daughter that Hopkins has in tow attracts Pitt's character, and Death takes a little sojourn to get to know more about life in general and this family in particular.<br /><br />This is a thoughtful exploration of the fact of Death, its effect on us, and the way in which so many of us are in active denial of both its massive consequences and its finality.  Indeed, most of us live our own days as if we were immortal, building up estates and relationships as though to last forever. Yet for us, forever cannot be achieved, at least not on this particular mortal plain.  It is precisely in our denial, however, that we come closest to understanding what death really means, both for us in particular and for those meaningful others that surround us. It is this curious fact that the director spends his time so beautifully in exploring, albeit with some classic Hollywood twists and turns in the plot to show us that under the right set of circumstances, perhaps Death may be bargained with, after all.<br /><br />Both Hopkins and Pitt do a wonderful job here, as does the lovely young actress, Claire Forlani.  The sets are used to great effect, and the more than three-hour length of the movie transpires without one really noticing how much time has elapsed, a mark of an entertaining film.  This is a quite thoughtful film, and one that requires a lot of introspection and careful attention. It is not for the faint of heart, and I don't think it will be of particular appeal to younger viewers, who very often are active denial regarding their own mortality and are unlikely to appreciate the thoughtful discussion they would discover here. This is a great movie, and one I would heartily recommend for those filmgoers mature enough to appreciate it.

B00003CXBK|5.0|To those in the know, Hayao Miyazaki is more than just a master of anime (Japanese animation), he is a truly great artist who transcends cultural and genre boundaries to explore universal themes with surprising depth and subtlety.  Those who appreciate drawn art (comics, animation) but are unfamiliar with Miyazaki, you are in for a real treat!  For those who don't &quot;get&quot; the medium, no amount of gushing will persuade--your loss, but know this: Miyazaki infuses all of his work with the soul of a poet and his work can often be quite moving.<br />Like much of his other work, Princess Mononoke is for older children and adults, not for unsuspecting toddlers.  The themes explored are dark and disturbing--and highly relevant to these times.  There is violence depicted.  But in an age dominated by Disney pap and a veritable wasteland of inane TV cartoons, Princess Mononoke is a refreshing alternative boasting gorgeous character animation, spectacular background art, and a storyline of substance that will reward the attentive viewer with inspiring stimulation of heart, mind, and soul.

6304493681|2.0|Let's face it, this anime is beautiful. But instead of deciding to tell Masamune Shirow's epic story in a series of films, the producers decided to pack hundreds of pages of manga into a 2 hour feature with slick production values. <br />What's even worse is that Shirow's characters are drawn and animated by other people! His great artistic style is not at all present here. If you have ever seen the &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot; PlayStation game, you've seen Ghost in the Shell as animated by Masamune Shirow. That is what this film should have looked like.<br />Roger Ebert and James Cameron gave this film two thumbs up, but it's doubtful they read the source manga. If they did they would say the film is the equivalent of trying to grasp the meaning of the Bible in a 10 page synopsis. <br />The plot of this Anime falls terribly short. I've read the entire manga and what the film presents is the prologue, and the last two chapters hastily slapped together. If you are an anime/manga fan, I urge you to spend the money on the manga and not this DVD.
B00005Q3TZ|5.0|This was alot better than the original.  For the most part it remained the same...until the attack on Pearl Harbor.  Then it began to get very R rated.

6304698682|3.0|The next paragraphs may make it sound like I don't like this movie, because it's predictable - quite the contrary! This is the absolutely classic western story line: Band of hapless miners/farmers/ranchers/shopkeepers/insert-your-favorite-group-here is being harassed by the local big-shot bully, who is generally making their lives miserable and difficult. Loner-type hero rides into town/camp/the ranch, and helps out a main character that's about to get the snot beaten out of him/her. Instantly, The Lone Stranger is elevated to an almost hero-like status, and the miners/townspeople/what-have-you convince him to stay and help them out. Despite the fact that he has no vested interest in these folks, they touch something deep within him, and he knows it's the right thing to do, so he stays.<br />With somewhat of a heavy hand, it is insinuated that this man is more than he seems - in this case, a preacher with a deadly aim, great fighting skills, and possibly checkered past. Still, he helps miners in their plight against the rich miner who's trying to drive them off of their legal claims, as the miner takes ever more violent strides in his quest. Not only is he evil because of trying to drive off The Decent Folk, but he uses terribly destructive methods to mine for the gold; he yields more ore more quickly, but the area left in his wake is completely destroyed. Of course, at least one of the good miners falls victim to the rich bloke, further steeling everyone's resolve; it's not just A Principle involved, now. <br />During the course of the film, naturally, the female characters fall in love with the preacher (who has no name, though you're not surprised by that, are you?) but he's just not a man to be had. Why, he's a loner, and he'll always be moving on from place to place, perhaps trying to escape his misdeeds of the past, perhaps trying to reconcile the two halves of himself, perhaps just enjoying a wandering lifestyle. Ah, the romantic West! The final confrontationcomes, comprising of a really amusing shootout with 6 corrupt deputies, and then, finally, the preacher confronts his old nemesis, a corrupt marshall. <BR>Still, despite the fact that this is indeed one of America's oldest stories, it's an entertaining movie. Even though you are absolutely certain of what's going to happen, the ride is still a good one. Sometimes, there's comfort to be found in stories we know - hence the rich oral tradition of many cultures, retelling the same story over and over, even though everyone knows how it goes, many sit completely enraptured through it. A story need not be new to be good.<br />Young Clint Eastwood is great as the preacher (and as the producer/director,) and Michael Moriarty does a wonderful job as well. This is a must-see western, simply for the sake of seeing this particular story well-told.

Their goal was to make an album of strained beauty, looking down at us from outer space, a pristine piece of detatched longing.  And in that goal, they achieved perfection, in my humble opinion.  However, you might take a listen and say \\"..., it doesn't sound like Sunday Bloody Sunday...\\" and that's okay.  It's your loss, not mine.<br />much love,<BR>mike porkchops

B00006AG5N|5.0|This is the ultimate CD valentine to -- and CD primer on -- Elvis Presley. Masterfully produced and beautifully remastered, it's a MUST for Elvis fans, anyone who wants to hear a \\"hunk 'o burning\\" Elvis at his best (and occasionally NOT-so-best), and for those discovering Elvis after being turned on by the JKL A Little Less Conversation remix. I recently bought this CD and listened to it repeatedly while on a 1000 mile drive. The biggest compliment I can give  it is: each time I've wanted to listen to it AGAIN.. and each time I discovered something different (from a song or a version of a song I had not heard) or heard a song differently (the remastering is topnotch).<br />  The catchy advertising campaign slogan (which is on the CD cover) says \\"Before Anyone Did Anything, Elvis Did Everything\\" -- and this CD shows you precisely why.<br />  This perfect Elvis-To-Go-in-a-single-CD for Elvis fans is also going to turn on a LOT of young people, even though not all tracks are stellar. Number One chart hits are not always artistic gems. But many here ARE. Why is this the CD that Elvis fans must own, new Elvis fans must get, and anyone interested in the ups and downs of show biz creativity should study? Here are a few reasons:<br />--MUSICAL DIVERSITY: From real rock (the early Hound Dog, Jailhouse Rock and wonderful late-Elvis Burning Love), to ballads (Love Me Tender, Are You Lonesome Tonight), to warmed over Italian ballads (One Night With You), to a \\"live\\" Vegas show stopper (The Wonder of You), to absolutely explosive early rock (A Big Hunk `O Love) and more -- it's all here...on ONE CD.<br />--YOU CAN TRACK ELVIS' CAREER AND CREATIVITY: Through these songs,young musicians, Elvis fans and show biz history buffs can experience the creative ups and downs in Elvis' career. Cuts from the 50s are generally  pioneering and sincere; by the 60s, during his movie-career period, some key hits were bland (a few almost embarrassing). But by the late 60s, in his comeback period, he was back doing what he wanted to do -- and at the end of his career his voice was in full bloom. You can see here how Elvis adjusted his music to each era (thus validating the recent remastering of A Little Less Conversation with modern back up, since Elvis would have used the most contemporary sounds). Despite his now cliched late-career weight gain, countless mall<br />shows, and alleged burn-out, Elvis' talent never left him, right up until the end.<br />--IT HAS SOME OF HIS BIGGEST HITS: This alone makes this CD a MUST own.<br />--YOU'LL DISCOVER SOMETHING NEW EACH TIME: Even though I am an Elvis fan I had not listened to A Big Hunk `O Love in many years. To me, this explosive (the vocal, drum, guitars and piano) and creative song was worth the price of the CD. It's also fascinating to listen to hear Elvis' early natural vocal technique evolve as the years rolled on and he worked to expand --  and display -- his technique and range. You can actually hear his voice change, as he matures.<br />--SUPERB REMASTERING: Due to 2002 state-of-the-art-remastering, Elvis has never sounded so crisp on early songs or even on later songs such as  his last real rocking hit Burning Love. Elvis fans who own other CDs WILL notice a BIG difference.<br />--EXCEPTIONAL LINER NOTES: Liner notes explain when each song was recorded, a bit of history, even Elvis' mood. Highly revealing info enhances your listening pleasure since each song has a history and a significance. Liner notes here read like a well-written and exhaustively-researched magazine article.<br />--THE CD'S LAST FOUR SONGS: When you listen to the Vegas-style The Wonder of You (1970), the rocking Burning Love (1972),  Way Down (1977, on the charts when he died), and the JKL A Little Less Conversation remix (a 1969 song recently revamped)you can't help but be blown away by the enormous talent, artistry and creativity. He may not have had teen idol-status at the end, but his talent had not diminished one iota....and theJKL remix shows that Elvis can be musically relevant -- and awe -- new generations.<br />Overall, Presley's estate, RCA, the skillful engineers, and the CD liner writers did the King proud..and the JKL remix shows that Elvis can be musically relevant -- and awe -- new generations.<br />Overall, Presley's estate, RCA, the skillful engineers, and the CD liner writers did the King proud.
B000002HH2|5.0|Everyone I encounter who knows who Bjork is either loves or hates her work...doesn't seem to be any middle ground.  If you like only traditional pop, country or other genres and want all the songs on your albums to sound the same, stay away from Bjork.<br />If, on the other hand, you get tired of songs that all sound the same and are looking for something fresh, you'll love Bjork.  It seems she is trying something specifically unique on each track.  <br />I find 'Post' slightly more innovative and interesting than 'Debut', although both CDs are great.  Of this bunch, my favs are, in order:  Possibly Maybe, Isobel, Army of Me, Cover Me, Hyper Ballad and Enjoy, so the Amazon provided clips cover only half the good ones!  The only track I didn't care for is It's Oh So Quiet.<br />Get it and listen to someone who isn't afraid to experiment!
B00005RY7X|5.0|TO Me...this Cd and music could not have come at a better time..just when some music was gettin way out of line...Now actually I listen to mostly classic rock like Genesis and Phil Collins which are my absolute favorites, and Billy Squier who in my opinion is the best rock and roller...but...yea.... todays music mostly [isn't good], except some hip-hop and alternative music, Now the alternative music is getting better like with the addition of Nickelback,Default,Staind,and ANDREW W K!!..<br />This guy Andrew Wilkes Krier, is just a totally fun and great lookin rocker...he has the energy to take a 55 story skyscraper down with just his roaring voice...this guy has talent.. While holding down many day jobs when he moved to new york he was a one man band and released \\"girls own juice\\" and \\"party til you puke\\" on bulb records.  Now i mean if that guy can do that then he must be talented and have a sense of direction..<br />This hard rocking Cd is full of hard guitar riffs, piano chords, and just flat out rock n rollin' i cant wait to buy this cd im totally stoked bout the darn thing...its great stuff...\\"party hard\\",\\"she is beautiful\\",\\"got to do it\\", and \\"ready to die\\" are my favorites<br />Andrew's Party Hard video first scared ... me. i was thinkin it was weird..then i fell in love with it.with its raw power and just his way to try something different..it is different...way different then all the other music..its just sooo FUN!!..i listen to it before my varsity soccer games to pump me up.. its just...just awesome...so do yourself a favor..and get it....<BR>You wont regret it...
B00005JKNF|5.0|I had to turn on the sub-titles the second time to catch all of the dialog, but I thought it was great. It was an interesting plot that seemed to move along well. I esp. liked the extras on the CD it was very interesting how it was filmed. Well worth watching.
B00006IUL7|5.0|This movie was excellent! Very original story with a couple of new twists compared to the original from 1997. Pacino plays such a convincing cop with problems of his own. And Williams was phenomenal, i was very surprised. How could I go without mentionning director Christopher Nolan (Memento, Following), possibly one of the best new directors of our time, or any. This entire film was crafted beautifully, the visuals of Alaska, the good storytelling, the great acting & of course the direction. This is one of my favorite movies of the year, and hopefully, it will be greatly considered when Oscar time comes around. Also see: Insomnia(1997-Criterion Collection) & One Hour Photo.
B0000027RL|5.0|Pearl Jam's debut album &quot;Ten&quot; helped bring the grunge movement to the mainstream, and in the process created a frenzy.  Album opener &quot;Once&quot; has a catchy punk-ish vibe and gets the album off to a great start, followed by smash hit radio singles (and what would be rock radio staples) &quot;Even Flow&quot;, &quot;Alive&quot;, &quot;Jeremy&quot;, and &quot;Black&quot;.  While those songs got the most attention, &quot;Garden&quot;, &quot;Why Go&quot;, &quot;Oceans&quot;, and &quot;Release&quot; are straight forward rockers that round out &quot;Ten&quot; rather nicely.  And yes, even though it is a single, my favorite song from this album is &quot;Black&quot;, it is just so heart wrenching you can hear the pain in Eddie Vedder's voice.  That alone is something that helped this album become a blockbuster smash, that is something that the bands of today in this &quot;post-grunge sensitive rock&quot; wave like Creed, Nickelback, and countless others can and will never have, the raw emotion.  &quot;Ten&quot; would go on to sell over 10 million plus copies and made Pearl Jam one of the world's most recognized bands (Vedder was even on the cover of TIME magazine), but no other album that they would ever release, even ones that were better than &quot;Ten&quot;, could never match the commercial sucess of this album.  Overrated?  Maybe, but no one can deny the impact that this landmark debut album had.
B00004Z459|2.0|Well, see, the thing that gets me, is people that like to call this music \\"metal\\" and \\"rock.\\" What this is, is a joke! It's overplayed MTV [stuff]...I mean, seriously, the music sounds like a lot of other stuff that's floating around and overall, it is just plain bad. The reason I gave it two stars is because there is one song that I somewhat care for, and that is \\"Pushing Me Away,\\" mainly because this song was different from the rest on the CD. If you want to listen to REAL rock and metal, check out some stuff by Slayer, Slipknot, Mudvayne, or In Flames.
B00005JKG7|5.0|I'd been waiting for the release of the original version of \\"The Fog\\" on DVD. I was not disappointed. After seeing it in widescreen for the first time since it's 1979 theatrical release, I will never watch this movie in full screen again. The extras are just right. A few interviews from past and present. Theatrical trailers, out takes and even an easter egg. John Carpenter knows how to make creepy movies. Scary is one thing. Blood and guts is another but this guy knows how to get the right atmosphere. That is the one thing I have always liked about Carpenter's movies. They are always dark and gloomy with just a hint of a breeze added for that extra chill. This is one of those films that is perfect for that \\"late friday night while hanging out with your girlfriend in the house\\" routine. Buy this version of 'The Fog' and ignore the useless remake. I don't care what ANYONE says, no horror collection is complete without this movie.

6305807043|5.0|You have to wonder how this one got by an industry that seems to release movies based on marketing surveys and the whatever the current political climate is.  For this is a movie unlike any other.  It takes big chances, and hits a home run, which gets it the five stars. <br />How to describe this movie without giving away too much plot is tough here.  Take a look at the box, and see the larger picture.  You see a big head with a door leading into it. First, guess who's head it is.  Next, notice that there are three people inside of it.  That should give you enough clues to pique your interest, without giving away too many details.  <br />But &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; is not the only weird thing going on here.  John Cusack plays an unemployed puppeteer (yes, he plays with puppets) who is more or less pushed into an office job by his roommate Cameron Diaz in order to contribute just a wee bit to the finances of the relationship.  Once again I'll try not to give away too much, but a day's work here involves using an elevator in a very special way, walking funny all day, and being prepared to have your co-workers seen to not here a word you say are all part of it.  <br />It is in this environment that the title action takes place.  Then, believe it or not, it gets weirder.  We see the adventures of the three that take on the title action, in different combinations.  We then get a special treat at the title character also takes place, and how it's handled is very creative.  <br />Strangely enough, everything is explained, believe it or not very clearly, although just as wierd.  The last scenes are a bit confusing, but are open to a lot of creative interpretation.  Which is only fitting, as this is one very creative, very strange, very entertaining movie.
B00005YXZH|5.0|This album was well put together.  It offers pop and underground contentions.  It flows well and the lyrics are contemplative as well as the music.
B000002UAX|4.0|The packaging of this double CD set is much better than for almost all the other Beatles albums on CD. It reflects the original packaging, and includes all the words and even some pictures which were censored [amazingly!] in the original released gramophone records.<br />There are some great songs here, and a few you would probably not want to listen to regularly.<br /><br />The album is a good showcase for the diverse songwriting talents of Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, and even includes a song Ringo wrote years before the release of the album.<br />John Lennon's best contributions:<br />Dear Prudence - a tender song with a great acoustic guitar part<br />Happiness Is A Warm Gun - a clever lyric, quirky rhythms and changing metres ... but it works!<br />I'm So Tired - expresses the feeling of sleeplessness very effectively ... makes you tired listening to it!<br />Julia - a poignant song written to John's mother, who abandoned him as a child. Albert Goldman should listen to this, and ponder his comments about John not being able to play the guitar<br />Yer Blues - a great rocky, bluesy song<br />Goodnight - John would have lampooned Paul, if he had written this soft, corny, but appropriate ending to the album!<br />Paul McCartney's best contributions:<br />Back In the USSR - a great rocky opener, including pseudo-Beach Boys' harmonies, and a great pun on Chuck Berry's Back In the USA, including the double meaning of &quot;Georgia&quot; in the line about Georgia being on my mind. [By the way, Ian Hammond, an Aussie Beatle fan, has recently pointed out that Georgia On My Mind is clearly Paul's inspiration for Yesterday.]<br />Ob-La-Di Ob-La-Da - a fun lyric and a great Jamaican-inspired musical creation<br />Martha My Dear - a great piano-based song.<br />Blackbird- one of Paul's best acoustic guitar compositions, and an interesting interplay of melody and accompaniment<br />I Will - a lovely song, with fun vocal imitation of bass guitar<br />Birthday - a terrific 12 bar blues rocker<br />Mother Nature's Son - another lovely acoustic song, with a subtle horn accompaniment<br />Helter Skelter - one of Paul's wildest songs<br />Honey Pie - a great tribute to the twenties, and John plays a terrific lead guitar solo<br />George Harrison's contributions:<br />Each Harrison song on the double set is terrific!<br />While My Guitar Gently Weeps - wonderful song, with terrific Clapton lead guitar part<br />Piggies - sardonic lyric, and great use of harpsichord<br />Long, Long, Long - beautiful, reflective song<br />Savoy Truffle - a really clever lyric about looking after your teeth, with a great use of saxophonesher Nature's Son - another lovely acoustic song, with a subtle horn accompaniment<BR>Helter Skelter - one of Paul's wildest songs<BR>Honey Pie - a great tribute to the twenties, and John plays a terrific lead guitar solo<br />George Harrison's contributions:<BR>Each Harrison song on the double set is terrific!<BR>While My Guitar Gently Weeps - wonderful song, with terrific Clapton lead guitar part<BR>Piggies - sardonic lyric, and great use of harpsichord<BR>Long, Long, Long - beautiful, reflective song<BR>Savoy Truffle - a really clever lyric about looking after your teeth, with a great use of saxophones
B00005JKDR|5.0|I anxiously awaited Monsters, Inc. I have loved everything they have done so far, and I loved this movie.<br />I must add though, that it is my least favorite of Pixars feature films, but I still give it 5 stars. The reason I like it less is that there was less character development. In Toy Story 1 and 2, and A Bug's Life, I thought the characters were deeper, richer, and I was deeply engaged in caring about how things turned out for them. With Monsters, Inc. I liked the characters, but they had little depth, so I didn't care as much what happened to them. This probably has a bit to do with the fact that the characters were Monsters, and were more 'cartoony' than other characters.<br />Also, the humor was a bit more sparse. In Pixar's previous efforts, it seemed lit every other line was filled with sharp, witty, humorous lines. In Monsters, it was a bit thinner.<br />Overall, I loved the movie. The only complaints are relative to the near perfection if its predecessors.
B00006DEF9|2.0|This movie is an absolute delight to see. The cast is tight and the music thoroughly enjoyable. It is especially fresh given today's films with dark sarcasm and anti-heros. What truely boggles the mind is the full-screen release! Was this movie originally released in a 4:3 format? I think probably not. And to see the effort that was put into restoring the soundtrack yet none was spent, seemingly, on trying to find a suitable original in the theatrical format. In this day of HDTV monitors and widescreen signals, this is unforgivable. I sincerely hope that this situation will be addressed in the future
B00005QG9J|5.0|I have to say that I had never payed enough attention to Incubus. A friend of mine told a couple of weeks ago to check out &quot;Morning View&quot;. I did ,and immediately had to buy the cd. Its one of the best albums I have bought during the last 3 years. I strongly recommend this one.
0767819594|5.0|When I first saw this movie in the Spring of '99, I expected another cheesy 90's teen movie; what I got was a twisted, manipulative, and rather clever screenplay, great acting from the four main characters, and a surprise ending, that was so unexpected that I found myself laughing in the theater (I was the only one!).  <br />Here's the situation: Sebastian Valmont (Ryan Phillippe) is a yuppie scumbag with a bad reputation that precedes him, who enjoys exploiting women sexually, his stepsister Kathryn (Sarah Michelle Gellar) is a manipulative social climber who also enjoys sexual exploitation, but is a \\"good girl\\" to everyone else but her brother.  Sebastian is sick of dating the same girls, and is looking for a real challenge.  Kathryn has just been dumped by her boyfriend (she usually does the dumping), and is looking for revenge.  Kathryn and Sebastian hatch a plan to ruin the life of her new boyfriend's squeeze, Celeste Caldwell (played hilariously by Selma Blair); on the side, Sebastian bets Kathryn that he can seduce the new headmaster's daughter, Annette Hargrove (Reese Witherspoon).  If Sebastian loses the bet, Kathryn gets his classic Jaguar roadster, if he wins, he gets to have get Kathryn in bed (anyway he wants).  <br />What follows is a hilarious string of manipulation, deceit, sex, betrayal, and eventual retribution.  This movie did not fare as well at the box office as it should have, opening against such movies as American Pie, American Beauty, and The Rage: Carrie 2.  Fortunately, it picked itself back up upon its video release.  I recommend the sequel to this movie also, as it explains the origins of Sebastian's bad reputation, and it's just more vulgar.  Gather your friends, pop some popcorn and have a great night!
0452282152|3.0|While I this book is well written and enjoyable, the story is not particularly compelling and the characters lack something. It provides an interesting picture of a young girl in Holland, but little else. Certainly not a page turner, but a solid and capable novel.
B00006FDCD|5.0|This movie always seems to scare the hell out of me. I remember watching this movie on TV, and now its on DVD. Perfect movie for your DVD collection...!!
B00005MP58|5.0|This is a great DVD set to own. The acting is great and, of course, the story is a classic. Plus, you'll want to watch Pride and Prejudice over and over again--especially if you're home sick for a day or just feel like spending a rainy winter weekend in bed. There's just something so comforting about the combination of Colin Firth and Jane Austen. I highly reccomend that you pick this DVD up.
B000069AUI|5.0|A Rush Of Blood To The Head is in my opinion the best Brit Pop Album of 2002.. Politik, the lead of tracks, has coldplay questioning political idealogy.. It may be pretencious but it's good song.. In My Place, seems to be a left over from Parachutes album but you can't simply can't get it out of your head.. The Scientist is an ultimate tear-jerker, a song about lost-love. It's the best track on the album. Clocks has the most amazing piano riff.. Coldplay almost have themselves in grunt mode in A Rush Of Blood to the Head.. It's funny to hear Chris Martin singing about Getting A Gun and Starting A War..<BR>There are also couple Hypnotic tracks (God Puts Smile Upon Your Face, Daylight, and Whisper), and folkish Green Eyes.. Over All. It's a great album..
B00006AG5N|4.0|I just got my copy ELVIS 30 #1 HITS and the sound has improved alot and sound \\"GREAT\\" but they should included ELVIS'#1 hits from the country charts and the R&B charts like \\"I WANT YOU, I NEED YOU, I LOVE YOU\\", \\"MOODY BLUE\\", \\"I FORGOT TO REMEMBER TO FORGET\\",\\"WEAR MY RING AROUND YOUR NECK\\", and so on do not get me wrong i thought the cd is great i just thought that the producers<BR>should have decided to make this a 2cd set than one.
B000002GH1|2.0|With the hugely successful movie soundtrack/single Dont You Forget About Me, Simple Minds artistic credibility had been severely dented. Many fans hoped that the Minds would, their bank balances replenished, return to the glacial sonic vistas of Sparkle in the Rain and New Gold Dream. But it was not to be. Departed bassist Derek Forbes showed just how vital he was to the Simple Minds sound. Once Upon a Time sees the band diving headlong into a quagmire of artless, watery, anthemic soul-pap. With the mainstream so firmly embraced, Simple Minds suddenly attracted hordes of new fans and a new musical direction was established. I disliked this record not only because of the thinness of the musical ideas contained within but because it somehow encapsulated the end of a golden era. Long, grey overcoats were shed in favour of hi-gloss tour jackets, and Simple Minds were suddenly an unstoppable juggernaut that Bon Jovi look like the Butthole Surfers. The pedal-to-the-metal bombast of Oh Jungleland; the cod-evangelical, reverb-up-to-11 claptrap of Sanctify Yourself; the blustering Alive and Kicking and the incomprehensible All The Things She Said all suggest that Simple Minds were  jettisoned the cool, glacial art-rock of New Gold Dream and Sparkle in the Rain in favour of a less demanding but more posturing sound (U2 have a lot to answer for). It was a great career move, of course, and by this time 80s production guru Trevor Horn was already waiting in the wings to produce their next, even more successful follow-up.
0967851408|5.0|Charles Haanel was brilliant, not only for his time, but all of his principles apply today and will continue to be a masterpiece in the future.The Master Key worked so well for the people who really applied the principles in his book, that it was banned by the Church in the 1930's.He originally wrote his 24 lessons for a group of business associates that requested he teach them what he was doing to be so successful in his business. When they found how well it worked for them, they requested he not let the general public in on their little \\"secret\\", and so, Charles only taught his methods to a select group for several years until he finally decided he should publish these principles of abundant living to anyone that would listen to the message. It didn't take long for the church to catch wind of what was going on, thereafter banning his book.That is why Haanel was not one of better known \\"New Thought\\" writers. Only after the 50th anniversary of his death, were the copyrights available to be published again. Don't miss out on a wonderful lesson for living! This is a terrific book! It can change your life.
B000066NW0|3.0|Sigh...for the past 2 summers now, intelligent managers from high profile studios have taken young women of average talent and promoted them as original, refreshing alternatives from mainstream pop--all the while insulting the intelligence of music listeners. Last summer, it was Alicia Keys, now it's Avril Lavigne. I'm truely not trying to hate on Avril, but she is NOT the anti-Britney Spears she claims to be...her complete look is totally contrived, not like the \\"old school\\" punk/grungers of the early 90's. Please, tell me what is so original and deep about lyrics like \\"He was a boy, she was a girl...\\" (from Sk8er boi--even the spelling of the name is completley contrived) As talentless as she is, at least Britney doesn't pretend to be anything more than a puppet.
B000001FI7|5.0|Will correct this mistake ASAP ;-)
B00006AG5N|5.0|I'd been looking forward to this release since I read about the extensive restoration work done on the master tapes for this release.  \\"Hard Headed Woman\\" is a revelation!  I've grown up with this song (I'm 49) and I had never heard the Jordanaires' backing so clearly and the brass is heavenly...it's like this was recorded yesterday and not 44 years ago.  I played the original single after listening to the cd.  Yes, it's the same recording, but it's like a veil has been lifted and we are transported to the room where Elvis and his band are performing.  \\"Crying in the Chapel\\" is incredible!  It's like hearing this song for the very first time.  I got goosebumps...really!  If you are a first time listener to Elvis, you might take these things for granted (not having lived with the originals).  To the long time fans who grew up listening to Elvis' music, trust me...you've NEVER hear it so good...this cd is a MUST!!!
078322737X|2.0|American Graffiti is one of my favorite films, and I was glad to get a copy of it on DVD.  I found the picture quality on this DVD edition to be stunning, but as I watched it I noticed immediately that the sound track was playing a half step sharp, putting all the songs in the film in a higher key.  Most people probably will not notice this but it was a major disappointment for me, as it will be for any other viewer who is sensitive to pitch.  Only at the end of the DVD is there any indication that the picture has been &quot;compressed,&quot; as many films seem to be that have been reissued on VHS and DVD.  Only in the accompanying documentary, where fragments of some of the songs are used, are the songs played at their normal speed.  I cannot understand why there is no information on the box cover that warns the buyer about this misrepresentation of the soundtrack, which in fact it is.  I reasonably assumed that the DVD version, labeled &quot;Collector's Edition&quot; would be a faithful reproduction of the film as it appeared in theaters, but this is not the case with regard to the sound track.  I cannot understand why this &quot;compressing,&quot; if indeed that is the cause, is applied to movies, unless it is to shorten their running time. If you are not sensitive to pitch, then you probably won't notice the fact that the songs are heard a half step sharp.  But if you are, this DVD version could be intolerable to you and a big disappointment, as it was to me.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|I've tried to watch this movie, I really have.  I guess the key to enjoying this movie is revealed in the first ten or fifteen minutes--the reference to Absinthe--you need to be high to enjoy this movie.  Well, I don't partake, so I didn't enjoy the movie. Let's just say that's two hours of my life I'll never get back.  I scored it &quot;one star&quot; because they wouldn't let me give it zero...or negative stars.<br />The music was LOUD--a hodgepodge of new and old songs. The most memorable song from the movie is a disco song from thirty years ago (there's a reason why disco is dead)that sounded way better by the original artist; derivative Nirvana (if Kurt Cobain hadn't already killed himself...)and a headache inducing &quot;'cause we can cancan&quot; that is an obnoxious beer commercial jingle now.  I guess everyone was excited over the fact that Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman could &quot;sing&quot;.  Yeah...ok....but some folks think they can &quot;act&quot; too. <br />Ewan is handsome....Nicole is pretty.  Lot's of loud music--flashing images..dancing. It's a &quot;love story&quot;.  It's one of the few movies where the &quot;extras&quot; on the DVD are way better than the movie itself. <br />People who enjoyed the movie say that those who don't &quot;just don't get it&quot;.  Yep.  I didn't get it at all.  And I'm damn proud I didn't.  (by the way--the Emperor isn't wearing any clothes!)<br />If you want to see a great musical, original music, outstanding acting, and meaningful storyline, get South Park, Bigger, Longer and Uncut.  The music is outstanding, the storyline is exceptional--everything you could want in a modern movie musical!  And you don't need to be high to enjoy/understand it.
B00005QIPH|5.0|This is the music I've been waiting for. The only &quot;hype&quot; I received was a recommendation from a friend. I have since amused myself by referencing the rabid response to The Strokes, most notably by the British press. My response to the already gathering backlash? Of course this album is derivative. All modern music, with the possible exceptions of Lou Reed's &quot;Metal Machine Music&quot; and John Cage's &quot;4'33&quot;, is derivative. Anyone who has a grasp of music history is aware of that and will understand the vast difference between deriving and copying. The Strokes aren't copying anything. There are few things I love more than listening to a band and realizing that they've spent years appreciating the same music that I appreciate. The Strokes do not sound like the 70's, which I remember well. They sound like NOW. Much criticism seems to be focused more on the personal details of The Strokes than on the music; the British press is especially eager to disparage them for having parents who aren't poor. Since the British tend to be fixated on class differences that mean little to most Americans, I'm hoping American press coverage will focus more on the music and less on irrelevant sour grapes. The music has raw rhythm and serious meat on its bones. The vocals are a masterful study in original phrasing and the lyrics are, refreshingly, not poetry. Rather than try to join in on the pigeonholing, I will instead tell you what The Strokes are not: They are not grandiose, retro, clever, punk rock, chic, lazy, studio musicians or a garage band. Don't read another word about them - just go listen to them.
B000007MVM|5.0|Few People, extremely few people have had the charisma to<br />transport themselves through time and space. Syd was aware<br />of his followers so extremely that he crossed too far over to<br />the other side. When Syd said &quot;I really love you, and I mean<br />you.&quot;, he really did mean it. He is trying to reach YOU.<br />He saw himself as a god, and quite possibly<br />he was. I mean quite possibly he tapped into the source of the<br />eternal universe that is within all of us, and that is why he<br />immediately seems familiar. This album is a testament to a<br />musical genius.
B00004T9AS|2.0|I knew that something was wrong with this album when I listened to the first track, &quot;Holy&quot;, and the words of a line in the chorus didn't seem to match what was on the lyric sheet. Then I listened more closely and realized that the singer had warped the pronunciation and scansion of the words to fit the music: &quot;Miracles, like you've ne-VER seen BE-fore!&quot; Give me a break! From a first-time artist whose native language wasn't English, I could have accepted this. But this is Mike Oldfield we're talking about! And if the music is so much more important than the lyrics, then for goodness' sake he could just stick to instrumentals. We know he's good at those.<br />If you want a good idea of what this album could have been, I suggest listening to Tony Banks' solo album &quot;Still&quot;, released at just the same time in the US. Multiple styles with male and female vocalists, an innovative blend of pop with progressive rock -- there's so much that Oldfield could have done, but he just fails to live up to his own standards on this album.<br />That said, there are a few gems on this album that make it worth dragging out from time to time, particularly with the programmable CD player. &quot;Innocent&quot; is a well-crafted pop tune that could have been a hit on US radio, if US radio stations had any taste. &quot;Hostage&quot; and &quot;Bridge to Paradise&quot; are two excellent rockers featuring Max Bacon, whose vocal work with GTR is still fondly remembered. But why was &quot;Bridge&quot; grafted onto &quot;Nothing But&quot;, a boring musical nonentity in pseudo-gospel style?<br />(Is it just me, or does Oldfield's quirky sense of humor show through on &quot;Bridge to Paradise&quot; -- I could swear that the background voices are singing &quot;Building the Brooklyn Bridge...&quot;)<br />I know that Oldfield can write a good pop-like tune without compromising his fine music. Take &quot;Moonlight Shadow&quot;, &quot;Magic Touch&quot;,&quot;Islands&quot;, oralmost all of the &quot;Discovery&quot; album. But on most of this album, he just doesn't make it all the way there.
B00006RCNW|5.0|I was first skeptical when I first heard of this show when they first were advertising it on FX as \\"Rampart\\". I remember watchig \\"X-Files: The Movie\\" and seeing this ad, then they said coming in 6 months. I was like \\"Yeah right, that won't work\\". Then about two months later more ads came on but the name had changed, and much for the better. This Emmy winning show would be named \\"The Shield\\".<br />After I watched the very first showing of the series premeir, I was completely stunned. The first episode brought so many things that normally would not work: Drama, action, violence, nudity, language, drugs, and even some Kid Rock music. Needless to say, the last four minutes were amazing. They come busting into the house perfectly rythmed with the Kid Rock music and then actually showed that guy get shot in the chest.<br />Amazing.<br />This show puts nearly every other cop/detective-related show to shame. The acting is top-notch (Chiklis got an Emmy), the action is some of the best ever done on a cable show, the conflicts between the characters is very believable, Chiklis doesn't play a hero, he has many more problems than anyone else in the show, and the story's most likely have happened before (this is NOT fiction).<br />I am very pleased this show is getting an early, Box set release, unlike many new shows like \\"The Dead Zone\\" which have started to produce DVD's that come with only 2 episodes on each disc. The re-runs were basically the only thing to hold me over the summer seasons besides Farscape. I am VERY pleased with the current winter season show line-ups, on all channels. FOX has \\"24\\", FX has \\"The Shield\\", CBS has \\"The Amazing Race\\", WB has \\"Angel\\", and NBC has \\"Fear Factor\\". This is going to be a very busy, yet very pleasing winter for TV viewers.<br />I highly recommend watching this show. I would NOT recommend kids under 13 watch it though. It IS rating TV-MA. It's just that now and then they show some really brutal and nasty things (remember the scene withthe rookie cop and the juwish guy?) That one kept me explaining to my 7 year old sister for hours....<br />My final words are: Buy the DVD, watch season 1, and get ready to see even more intense drama with season 2 starting January 7th.

While it may be possible to follow this book without haveing read the farseer series, I do not sugest it.

0792844793|5.0|Dennis Hopper is amazing as Frank, the evil trash talking lowlife. His preformance is so explosive and mind blowing that you'll find yourself quoting his lines for years after seeing this. <BR>David Lynch paints for us a surreal portrait of suburbia and it's soft, white underbelly of seedy characters, and sleazy places that only come out at night on the far side of town. It's really brilliant and just downright weird. Notable are Frank's little posse (\\"I'm Paul), Ben the Pimp and his whorehouse, and Isabella Rossalini (not the best singer in the world) perfectly portrays the abused victim. <BR>You'll never think of \\"In Dreams\\" by Roy Orbison the same way again. David Lynch was never this weird again with the expception of the incredible Mulholland Drive.
B00000K31Q|5.0|My fiance and I can't watch this flick enough!
B00005R2BG|2.0|Loved the costumes, especially the lingerie but I was not satisfied with the historical presentation of that decade, Moulin Rouge.  The music was too contemporary for that particular time, the 1890s.  I thought it would have been a drama based musical centering around the night club life.  But my expectations were not as what I predicted it to be.  This movie may have garnered the respect and high praise of the critics but to some viewers, it wasn't that great.
1558801871|5.0|I first saw this in theatres with a male companion and was impressed with the direction of the movie.  It was about a musician who was devoted to his music but took love for granted.  He had relationships with Clark and Indigo at the same time until he was busted by both women.  After being assaulted, he had to reevaluate himself not only as a musician, but as a person.  <br />I liked the movie.  Spike Lee is a good director and a driving force in the African-American cinema.  He doesn't pull any punches when it comes to racism and intraracial discrimination.  Despite how some critics pan him as being offensive and controversial, he continues to make movies that are political and social in the African-American community and outside.
B0000399WI|3.0|If I were to rate this based on the movie alone, it would get 5 stars, no contest. But the fact that the DVD is so unremarkable drags the rating down much lower than the movie deserves. Keep reading and you'll see my reasons.<br />I cannot praise the movie well enough, since it is one of my all time favorites. It tells the story of Andy Defresne (Tim Robbins), a banker who was wrongfully convicted of murder, and spent 19 years in prison for it. During his time, he befriends a pretty, but intellegent, crook (Morgan Freeman), and their bond solidifies as the years grow. Dufresne himself makes a difference in almost all the prisoner's lives, by showing that the cruelty of the prison cannot darken his will and spirit. It is an inspiring movie, it's almost hard to believe that it is based on a Stephen King story. Everything about the movie fits, the acting, the writing, and the entertainment. It is an exceptional movie.<br />Why is it that Warner decided to release this great movie in DVD devoid of quality extras. Next to one theatrical trailer, some totally uninteresting filographies, and a paper-thin photo gallery, there is nothinh else of interest beside the movie itself. There are no commentaries, no featurettes, and no insight from the filmmakers. Basically, everything you would want is not included on the DVD. But worse yet is the packaging. I don't know why Warner thinks that it's a good idea to sell DVDs in those cheap \\"Snapper\\" cased (The thin cardboard with a plastic frame that 'snaps' on the side), because it will not last long without getting dinged and scratched. As a principle, I refuse to buy movies in \\"Snapper\\" cases. This was the one exception.<br />If you already have the VHS version, the only real incentive to get the DVD is the anamorphic widescreen transfer, which gives the picture a crisp, clear look. The sound quality is also nicely kicked up, and it's a special benefit to those with surround sound, because it's the next best thing to actually being in the theatre.<br />One of the biggest qualms I have with the standard of DVDs today is that second-rate movies get the 2-disc \\"all inclusive\\" DVD treatment, while brilliant movies like \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" get the minimalist, barren treatment. I am hoping that they will release a special edition DVD sometime in the near future, because this is not the \\"definitave edition\\" of the movie. Fingers crossed.ng in the theatre. <br />One of the biggest qualms I have with the standard of DVDs today is that second-rate movies get the 2-disc \\"all inclusive\\" DVD treatment, while brilliant movies like \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" get the minimalist, barren treatment.

B000003C2U|5.0|This album is simply fantastic.  Everything on this album is damn near perfect.  Chuck's vocals are superb, his voice carries so much conviction.  Check out album highlight \\"Lack of Comprehension\\" for evidence of this.  The lyrics are very insightful, and show no holding back for the wrongs in society.  The guitar riffs and solos are magnificent, especially in Lack of Comprehension and album opener \\"Flattening of Emotions\\".  <br />Don't let the fact that Death are defunct put you off checking them out.  You need this much more than the latest cd by that band you'll be seeing next week.
B000062YAZ|2.0|Are you kidding me? <BR>Are you guys really all blind?<BR>This album stinks. This gives metal bad name. Full of blind speed, horrible and stupid lyrics, and where is diversity?<BR>This is one of the most boring cd I have ever tried. You want to enjoy real heavy but smart thrash? Try Old (yes, old) Metallica or Old Megadeth. If you just want to give a shot to Slyer, try Seasons in the abyss.<BR>All guys who says that Reign in blood is the true masterpiece, please wake up~! This cd is just for 11-year-old kids pretending to be metalheads.
B0000640VO|5.0|Wow! It's amazing to see a comedy that doesn't slip into two dimensional characters and toilet humour days (the new Austin Powers movie leaps to mind). 'Amelie' shows an intellegence and maturity in it's humour not seen in American movies, and you come out of watching this movie with a lust for life and feeling the magic of being alive. Arthouse films aren't my key area of interest, but trust me, like the Italian film 'Life Is Beautiful' you'll forget your watching a subtitled movie within five minutes.<br />A wonderful film that has no faults, and will make you laugh whilst not making fun of anyone. Every person in this has his/her own story and eccentricity, and the movie oozes richness and wealth of character.
B00006J9OT|5.0|This CD is so good, I am beginning to be believe there is some sort of subliminal messaging going on. :-)  I am a great Diana fan and just LOVE this CD.  The sound is great.  Her version of \\"Fly Me to the Moon\\" is alone worth the price of the CD.  This should quiet all those folks that have been complaining that Diana wasn't \\"jazz\\" anymore.  I have one thing to say:<br />
B00006IM9Q|5.0|This updates 1984's Best Of Blondie with 9 more songs, going all the way up to 1999's \\"Maria\\".  There are up-to-date liner notes, a few photos and song/album information for each song.  Also, the sound is better than the previous Best of.  The expanded song lineup gives listeners a chance to hear great album cuts like \\"X Offender\\" and UK charting singles like \\"Denis\\" (a cover of the 1963 Randy & The Rainbows hit called \\"Denise\\").  All in all this renders Best of Blondie useless.  All of that CD's 12 songs are on this album.  This is a superb look at Blondie's career.
6302517052|5.0|I only rated this five stars because when I was about 9 or so I watched these movies religiously... Now I am more grown up and into better movies but this was still cute but never scared me. all the movies were cute and when younger I really enjoyed them!
B00006J9OT|4.0|This single-disc live set from Diana's recent tour provides a nice balance between Krall's earlier small group tracks and her more recent orchestral recordings.  Recommended if you want this material in CD format.  However, although there are two songs here that are not included on the video version, if you have a DVD player--particularly hooked up to a surround-sound system--I'd say that the DVD is the ultimate version of this title, with two full hours of the concert, plus two promotional videoclips and rehearsal footage.

0688156819|5.0|Hi. This book was a gift to me from a friend. and when i read the poem that the book is titled after, i cried. i probably cried the first six times i read it. i passed the book around to my friends, aquaintances, and enemies. and the funny thing is? all were moved by this book. This is a short \\"review,\\" yes, but i feel that if i used too many words something would be lost from the book. god. its a humbling experience reading and letting yourself be changed by this magnum opus.
B000002KCC|5.0|In the biography \\"Shakey\\",Neil recounted the feelings he had about the death of Danny Whitten.He was embarking on a huge tour and tried to get Danny involved with disasterous results - strung out on herion and unable to play even the simplest chords on his guitar,Neil made the hard choice of letting him go,giving him 50 dollars and a plane ticket back to L.A.<br /><br />Later the next day he recieved a phone call from an L.A detective asking him about a body found with no I.D and just a slip of paper with Neils` name and number on it...Danny had o.d.`d and was dead,leaving friends to wonder why and effectively ending Crazy Horses` existince.A few months later,roadie and friend Bruce Berry met the same fate - dying out on the mainline.<br /><br />The effects of these people close to him dying would cause Neil to enter a period of alchohol and substance abuse that would eventually lead him to gather the remenants of Crazy Horse,Ben Keith and Nils Lofgren and proceed,under the guidence of producer David Briggs,to record a group of songs dealing with all the feelings of loss,regret and remorse felt by everyone involved.<br /><br />If you dismiss this disc as drunken,out of control and poorly recorded garbage,then you miss the point.The first couple of notes on piano set the ominous tone for what follows,a collection of naked and brutally direct songs miles away from anything that anybody was doing at that time.Recorded by a group of friends drinking and having a great time,basically a wake, then playing a full live set of new songs to a non-existant audience (often using first takes,flaws and all)and getting all those feelings out and onto tape make this a great album.<br /><br />Songs like Borrowed Tune,Mellow My Mind and Lookout Joe reflect the feelings of all involved and then all the sudden we hear Danny Whitten singing \\"Come on Baby Lets Go Dowtown\\" - a live song recorded by Neil and Crazy Horse during a two night,four show stand at the famous Fillmore East.<br /><br />A song about copping herion,it brings home the message and makes it crystal clear,that all drugs do is kill....nothing else.<br /><br />But even after you listen to the whole disc,the reprise of Tonights the Night ends the disc with the same song that started it off but by now the message is clear and almost hopeful,that when it comes to music or living and dying for that matter,everyone has a choice and that is when you can say that tonight is the night when you make that choice for better or for worse.An essential release full of honesty and another important piece of the Neil Young puzzle.A favorite of mine and soon to be one of yours.herion,it brings home the message and makes it crystal clear,that all drugs do is kill....nothing else. <br />But even after you listen to the whole disc,the reprise of Tonights the Night ends the disc with the same song that started it off but by now the message is clear and almost hopeful,that when it comes to music or living and dying for that matter,everyone has a choice and that is when you can say that tonight is the night when you make that choice for better or for worse.An essential release full of honesty and another important piece of the Neil Young puzzle.A favorite of mine and soon to be one of yours. <br />
081541028X|5.0|I hate reviews that alternatively gush or are entirely critical of an author's work. Such reviews could be boiled down to a simple \\"buy the book\\" or \\"don't buy the book\\". Having got that out of the way, this is the best autobiography I have ever read. Period.<br />Michael Collins has produced what should be the definitive text for any writing class and for any history class dealing with the latter half of the 20th Century. The writing is clear and concise. The technical subject matter does not overwhelm the human story. Humor is woven throughout (Collins alone in the bar telling the bartender that he's going \\"up there\\" - which earns him considerable distance from the bartender and no more drinks after the first). For someone who was literally one of the chosen few and came out on top in a competition among the \\"best of the best\\", the self-deprecating style is delightful and, quite frankly, refreshing. Nothing can be better than an important story, well told. This is it.<br />Three sad points, however. First, I am unaware that Michael Collins ever wrote another completely unique book (his second outing was a somewhat simplified version of this book). We are all poorer off as a result. Using this work as an example, I would buy a book on the pros and cons of wet socks if it was written by Michael Collins.<br />Second, while men like Michael Collins are probably still around, I am not sure that we are giving them the opportunity to show us the greatness we can achieve when we put our minds to it. This book reminds us that real heroes aren't judged on what their latest movie did at the box office or what their latest baseball contract is worth. Men like Collins signed on to risk their lives as part of a group accomplishing something that was truly exciting and worthwhile. Can any of us even name one astronaut from the latest shuttle or ISS mission (not including kid singers who want to buy a ride - or have others buy it for them)? The fact that times have changed so much from Collins' heydays is sad.<br />Third, this is the second copy of this book that I have had to purchase. Against my better judgment, I loaned my first copy to a friend (just who I can't now recall) and never saw it again. I'm telling the next guy who asks to borrow this one to go out and buy his own. I suggest you do the same.<br />And oh yeah - buy the book.
B00000K2SE|5.0|Up until this movie's release, there wasn't much to say for cyberpunk movies. Films like \\"Johnny Mnemonic,\\" \\"The Lawnmower Man,\\" \\"Hackers,\\" and \\"Menno's Mind\\" had all ventured into this subgenre of science-fiction, but none had really delved far enough into the realm and most left a disappointing after-effect. Enter the Wachowski Brothers, two talented filmmakers with a love for cyberpunk and kung-fu movies as well as philosophy and romantic themes. They got cyberpunk veteran Keanu Reeves as their main character and found a terrific supporting cast in Joe Pantoliano, Lawrence Fishburne, Cary-Anne Moss, and Hugo Weaving. Their story was a simple good-vs.-evil plot with the character Neo discovering that he is the one to bring balance to the force... er, I mean he is the one to save humanity. The plot had been seen before, but never like this. The Wachowskis combined stylized visuals with wild kung-fu and gunfights and molded a modern-day classic that has since spawned a new era in filmmaking where computers are as important as the camera. But \\"The Matrix\\" was more than just a revolutionary and visionary film, it was also a heckuva movie experience! Moviegoers flocked to this movie and were dumbfounded by the awesome action and quickly-moving storyline. Not only was the film a new step for moviemaking, it was also an incredibly good movie! The film recieved awards for its special-effects, but little was said about its plot or characters, something that is at the heart of this film. \\"The Matrix\\" is an excellent film and rates as one of the best in the past five years.
0312955006|5.0|I had read \\"Concrete Blonde\\" about a year and a half ago, not knowing it was the third book in the Harry Bosch series.  Now, I have read the first two Bosch books, and see how good a book \\"The Concrete Blonde\\" is.  Bosch is as always a well-developed and complex \\"hero\\" or \\"anithero.\\"  At least in this one, Chief Irvin seems to be a little more understanding and appreciative of Bosch.  Bosch also shows his sensitive side as he refuses to the ruin the career of a fellow cop who leaks information to the sharp lawyer, Honey Daniels.<br />The book balances the courtroom action and the new Dollmaker case with marvelous dialogue and scenarios.  It's hard to really judge Harry on what he did with the Dollmaker four years ago. Was he right?  Is he a cowboy?  Does he really like death and violence?  These questions aren't quite answered, but we still get a feeling of what Harry's gone through since this case started.  Bosch also solidifies his relationiship with Sylvia, the ex-wife of a cop who was featured in \\"Black Ice.\\"  The ending intimates more to come in this regard.<br />My favorite character in this one is \\"Hans Off\\", the administratively proficient, but criminally incompetent, lead investigator.  He is good at getting a coffee pot in the team's unit, but can't think of anything on his own.  A sharp character.  In fact, Connelly's supporting cast is always very well developed.<br />A great read, now on to the \\"The Last Coyote.\\"<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
B000069CWE|1.0|one word. this is the worst cd ever. i love hybrid theory, which is probably why i hate this cd so much. hybrid theory had just the right mix of rock and rap. this cd is all rap/hip-hop/.... this is not linkin park. why would you change something that was so great to begin with? i think linkin park are the biggest sellouts ever. don't get this cd. If you want a good cd, go out and get finch or offspring. this is not music.
B000066F6H|2.0|With all the horrible music that the industry is putting out today it is tempting to jump on anything that does not totally stink. Resist! The Hives are not a horrible band but they certainly are not on the same level as The Pixies. In an interview with Rolling Stone lead singer \\"Howlin\\", as he calls himself, is quoted as saying that he does not listen or even like a lot of music. That would explain the total lack of diversity that he shows as a singer. In a music industry that is surrouned by pre-fab boy bands and and annoying wanna be Korn childern (god knows why) this may seem like a relief but just becuase someone slaps the label Punk on themselves does not make them worthwhile. Investigate other avenues of music before succumbing to this new wave of surface punk.
B00005OAIE|5.0|This album is sure to win John Mayer the Best New Artist Grammy come next February, if not album of the year.  The reviewer for Amazon.com must be in a coma.  A Friend of mine turned me on to his music when his was an indie artist in Atlanta. His indie release 'Inside Wants Out' was a prelude to 'Room For Squares' and has just been re-released.  As for this disk, I have shared it with every person I know who has any taste in music, and they've all loved it as much as I have. The appeal of this disk knows no generational boundaries.  Equally as amazing as the craftsmanship of the songs is the integrity of the lyrics.  I'm so tired of all the garbage bands out there who, like most of the rest of society, as so busy being angst-ridden, that they mistake 3 chords and a loud drum track as music. John Mayer talks honestly about what it is to be alive. No fairy tales, but no overexageration about how tough his life is.  The thing that makes the guy stand out from the crowd is how his songs relate to the audience of twenty-something listeners who are flocking to his live shows in droves.  That, and his awesome melodies. He's grounded in reality and (oh by the way) actually possesses a music background.  The guy is a beast on the guitar and is the long awaited deliverance from the endless rubbish the record companies have been spewing for the last seven or eight years.  Buy this record, or risk spending the next ten years trying to explain why you didn't recognize this man's talent from the word go!
B00005JKJA|1.0|Before I saw this film, I honestly thought I couldn't hate a movie more than I hated Armageddon. Boy was I wrong! As bad as Armageddon is, it at least has a coherent ending. Though Lost Highway had infuriated me, The Straight Story made me forgive Lynch for indulging himself in utter absudity for it's own sake. But with Mulholland Drive, I realized that he is a lost case. Lynch has descended completely into the echo chamber of his own mind, and he's not interested in letting the rest of us in.
B00006J9OT|5.0|What an amazing recording this is. Sonic perfection as well as as musical soul......... maybe the best recorded live record i've ever heard.<br />Diana Krall has built her reputation as a musician on her live performances and now we finally get to take one home with us. She is singing so well and her piano playing gets better every time I hear her....Kudos to Diana! <br />This proves that while she is beautiful, she is most certainly a world class musician. If you have seen her live you will definately want this CD. If you haven't seen her live, what are you waiting for :) in the meantime get this CD to see what you are missing.
B00006F7S4|3.0|I slapped in this cd eagerly anticipating a fun, absurd wild ride along the lines of Odelay and Midnight Vultures. After the first track I knew that I should have never expected anything predictable from Beck. Due to my excited mood at the time, I was unmoved by this record on the first listen. But I left it the player and the next morning I listened again. This time my mood was right for this sultry and thoughtful side of Beck.  There are still rich sonic layers imbedded in this otherwise trimmed down mix of melancholy songs, and Beck once again shines as a true musical talent of our time. The cd has stayed in the player for several days now, and I am chill and yes, a bit pensive.
B0000542DJ|5.0|...<BR>As far the assasination itself, it would be stupid to ignore the facts, and the only fact necessary to realize that there was more than one shooter is the footage of the actual shooting itself. Any person with an iota of common sense can tell that the shots fired came from vastly different angles. That means more than one person and that means conspiracy. Now as for the rest of the speculations Oliver Stone indulges in, I doubt that a lot of it is factual. However, as a movie, its a masterpiece, highly ambitious and meticulously crafted.<BR>How deep a conspiracy is a matter for discussion that will endure for the ages, but there is no question that one existed.

I didn't have a good attitude towards it at first, but I got really into it after about page 20.  Although the book is about a group of rabbits and they're quest, its very hard to differentiate between the rabbits and humans.  Recomended for everyone
B00005R2BG|5.0|This movie was very strange, even before the moment a character came through the ceiling.<br />And I absolutely loved it.<br />The songs were a strange mix, but they worked perfectly.  Kidman and McGregor and the rest of the cast acted out their parts wonderfully.  This isn't a movie I'm likely to forget.

B00003CXAE|3.0|The dvd itself is highly disappointing. There are only two extras, a trailer and some lame interviews with the stars. Didi Conn is the only one who seemed to offer true insight. The words coming out everyone's mouth just didn't seem to amount to anything except they didn't know what to say.  VH1's \\"Where are they Now?\\" on \\"Grease\\" was much better.<br />There is also a songbook, inside the dvd cover.  For anyone who has ever questioned the lyrics to \\"You're the one that I want\\", here is your chance to see them in all their glory.<br />I'm sure another edition is being planned with next year being the 25th Anniversary.<br />Hopefully, for fans of the movie and fans of all those \\"extras\\", there will be a much better package.<br />One other complaint I have about this dvd is that you have to buy both editions, widescreen and full screen, to have the two options as they are not all on one dvd.  Of course, Widescreen rules! But what a gyp! I have other dvds that have this as an option.<br />I still love this movie! It's endearing to me, and It is pure fun. This is a movie I will always watch over and over so whether or not the `transfer' was well done doesn't matter because it will be worn from being used so much.
B00006AW2J|5.0|This review is for ALL the Stones reissues. My only concern with these discs was the sound of the SACD layer. All my doubts were laid to rest during the first 10 seconds of Sympathy For The Devil. If you don't allready own a SACD player by all means buy one and check-out the sound of these STUNNING reissues. Bonus tracks and extra liner notes, who needs them. By the way, these WILL play on a PC and the non-sacd layer can be burned to a CD-R.
6305736650|5.0|I avoided this film for years and years thinking it was going to be just another mushy load of love story pap, and for once I'm happy to say I was wrong, very wrong.<br />The Love story between the two main actors plays more like a sub-plot than a main story, which is off course about Nazis invading Casablanca, a lot of people seem to forget this. <br />The other thing people forget is how witty the script is, EI: when Rick is asked what his nationality is he replies \\"I am a drunkard\\", I often found myself chuckling through this movie. <br />Everything else great about this movie has been said a thousand times before and probably a thousand times better than I ever could say them, and its all true.<br />Buy it and see.
B00000119Z|4.0|I think the only reason I gave this only a 4-star rating is because a few of the songs haven't aged well. Things like the 'good wizard meets the naughty wizard' feel like a Monty Python skit. Really dumb. <br />But 90% of the fare here is excellent pysch pop, and the musicianship and performances are top shelf. Listen to Steve Howe playing guitar on the Byrds cover 'Why' and you will be amazed. Please don't let my minor negativity talk you out of purchasing this important record. Tomorrow deserve to be remembered and emulated. They were damn cool. <br />Tune in, Turn on and DROP
B00005JKG7|5.0|Incredibly atmospheric chiller from John Carpenter.Not quite as scary as it should be but this is still one of the finest horrors of recent years.I've always loved Carpenter's mastery of the Panavision frame and this beautiful disc shows off his fine compositions to brilliant effect.Great stuff.
B00003CX9Q|5.0|It's my favorite childhood movie. And know it is released again. Wow!! ...
0060090383|4.0|I had read most of Marian Keyes' other books, and this one is far and away the best of the bunch.  It's funny, absorbing, heartbreaking, and totally believable.  The reader gets to accompany Rachel on her journey towards realizing that she has a drug problem, learning the most damning information about he problem as she does, in small glimpses told by her friends or in flashbacks.  Ms. Keyes does a wonderful job with her characters and the relationships between them - the scenes between Rachel and her mom, in particular, were wrenchingly real.  My only gripe was the too-neat fairy tale ending.  But that tiny flaw is a small price to pay for what, for me, was an unexpectedly great read.
B00006HBUA|2.0|The movie is a family hit.<BR>I liked it when I saw it for the second time, but it is a little boring. My suggestion for you is to buy the dvd, because scooby is an important character. He's great, fun, and deserves a nomination for best animated..
0345360338|4.0|Penman has done it again. Her descriptions of the machinations of the King John of Magana Carta fame and the richness of her Welsh portrait make this a wonderful book. Perhaps the weakest points are the passages in which she introduces one of the major characters, John's illegitimate daugter Joanna. Here she spends too much time on the young girl's thoughts. These passages are not really preparatory to understand Joanna. STill, the book is a good read.
B00006J3T4|4.0|Mark Knopfler's third solo album (not counting his numerous film soundtracks) is his bluesiest yet.  \\"The Ragpicker's Dream\\" features 12 tracks and clocks in at almost 56 minutes.  All tracks include vocals and the backing band is top notch and features (of course) Guy Fletcher on keyboards and some nice drumwork by Chad Cromwell.  Paul Franklin adds his pedal steel mastery to three of the tracks.  The piano (played by Jim Cox who also plays organ on several of the more bluesy tracks) is more prominent than on previous solo efforts as well, and adds a jazz-like quality to several of the tracks.<br />Musically, \\"TRD\\" is steeped in the blues with hints of folk, swing, and jazz.  As for comparisons with previous work, this disc is most similar to the \\"Wag the Dog\\" soundtrack and (in some instances) Dire Straits' \\"On Every Street\\".  The focus is the music (and also the lyrics) and not so much the guitar work.  There's some crying and singing, but mostly the playing is subdued and workmanlike.  There are no hyper-emotional solos (although some of the work on \\"Devil Baby\\" comes close) like on \\"Are We in Trouble Now\\" or \\"Nobody's Got the Gun\\" from \\"Goldenheart\\".  If that's what you're looking for, you may be a tad disappointed in TRD.  If not, you'll be well-satisfied by this release.  There are a lot of bluesy numbers (\\"Why Aye Man\\", \\"Marbletown\\", and the Soggy Bottom Boys' sounding \\"Fare the Well Northumberland\\"), some jazz-inflicted tracks (\\"A Place Where We Used to Live\\") and several playful tunes (\\"Coyote\\", \\"Quality Shoe\\" and \\"Daddy's Gone to Knoxville\\").  The brilliant \\"Ragpicker's Dream\\" would've fit (musically) nicely on \\"The Princess Bride\\" soundtrack.  <br />Lyrically, TRD focuses on blue collar workers and workingclass towns.  The songs are poetic (especially \\"Ragpicker's Dream\\" and \\"Old Pigweed\\"), wistful, and often deal with working--both the land, the job, and other people.  Overall, this album is a positive continuation of \\"Sailing to Philadelphia\\" with a familiar, but more bluesy feel to it and still fewer emotional guitar solos.  Definitely Recommended.
B00006FMDA|5.0|The Beatles in 5.1 surround sound - WOW !! Hadn't seen the movie in widescreen before, either. What a presentation!! Worth every penny, even if you've bought it before. Found the interviews on disc 2 somewhat boring, though.
6304698526|4.0|This movie is the pattern for Dirty Harry and every car chase film that followed-both good and bad. The well-known car chase scene might have lost just a bit of luster over the years but remember, it was a first of its' kind in 1968. I'm old enough to remember this movie at the theater on a big screen (before the cineplex small screen devolution) and man, when the cars were jumping the hills in SF- you were there! Just ask my stomach. Watching on a small screen at home I'd recommend turning out the lights during the chase and enjoying the 7 minute rollercoaster ride. Name another movie that had a car named after it. In 2001 Ford put out a limited edition Mustang GT Bullitt, dark green fastback in homage to Steve and the \\"chase\\". I know that many movies that followed had impressive and more complex car chases but Bullit was first-name an earlier one. After Bullitt there was \\"The French Connection\\", \\"The Seven-Ups\\", \\"Dirty Mary,Crazy Larry\\", \\"Smokey and the Bandit\\", even \\"The Blues Brothers\\" and many, many more. So you can say that Bullitt created a subgenre of movies that lasted for more than a decade. Even TV got into the action (Dukes of Hazzard). Like I said -both good and bad. Now the movie storyline is great too. I've read many reviews here that say the movie moves too slow with little action. I disagree. Does \\"The Godfather\\" move too slow with little action too? The movie is done in a realistic, gritty style that has moments of explosive violence punctuating intelligent dialogue, acting and storyline-especially for 1968. Very much in the French style of film-making, as were French Connection, Dirty Harry, Laughing Policeman,The Exorcist, Atlantic City, et al. When the witness is blown away by a shot gun blast to the midsection he flys off his feet and slams into the wall-very realistic even by todays' jaded eye. No computer generated scenes here. Just good ole' special effects. Steve McQueen would be 72 if he lived but like so many other cultural icons that wasn't meant to be. Live fast, die young (well, middle-aged) and leave us with some wonderful movies.The Great Escape, Cincinnatti Kid, The Getaway, Papillon, The Thomas Crown Affair, On Any Sunday, Baby The Rain Must Fall, Junior Bonner, The Magnificent Seven, Le Mans, The Sand Pebbles, Nevada Smith, and more. Where are the Steve McQueen's of today? None of today's \\"stars\\" could be believable(laughable) in his roles. McQueen could kick any of their ... figuratively and literally. We miss you Steve!
B000000993|5.0|I remember first hearing this CD when it had not even recieved the eventually monolith airplay it would later attain. Upon the first exposure to Tool I was stunned by not only the strong guitar riffs, melodic basslines, and brooding vocals, but the overall flow of the songs, how they seemed to drift into each other and were very carefully arranged to present something utterly magnificent.<br />Intolerance opens the CD and sets the tone of what you will hear from here on in. Prison Sex follow, leading into 2 of the strongest songs here, Sober and Bottom. Bottom features a sort of spoken word by Henry Rollins that is both meaningful and disturbing, it is something that anyone who listens to it once will NEVER forget. Swamp Song is another of my favorites, it has a great pace and once again has that brooding menace that seems to reign supreme in this disc. The last song Disgustipated is experimental and somewhat bizarre, yet very captivating to me. Tool ends this on a somber yet chilling note.<br />Undertow is a brilliant undertaking and still to this day remains one of the strongest discs released in the 90's.
B00003CWL6|2.0|This is suburban life? How many books do you see in the Burnham household? The mother and the father have absolutely no interest in anything outside their jobs, i can hear people saying 'well isn't that what suburban life is like?' no, it isn't, oh well, Hollywood has misrepresented every other group in society over the years i guess we can't expect them to do any better with the middle classes. The only moment where Spacey's character touches reality is when he bemoans having to miss the James Bond marathon on tv because of his daughter's cheerleading. Come on, the mother listens to South Pacific at the dinner table, we're off in Hollywood lala land...<br />The screenplay is one of the laziest most hackneyed pieces of writing i've ever come across, veering between shallow and predictable teen soap opera and something akin to american pie. The 'at least i'm not ugly' 'yes you are, you're ugly on the inside' moment is as cheap as they come, it even brought a celebratory roar out of the audience and a few springeresque whoops. Also, the screaming of ridiculous things at the point of orgasm is as tired a joke as they come, it got the biggest laugh in the cinema. And of course the [friend] is really a virgin, and when he finds out Lester Burnham decides not to do her right there on the sofa.<br />The film could prbably get away with it if it did just declare itself to be american pie lite, but it doesn't, it makes sure you don't leave the cinema believing it to be anything other than an 'art' film by slowing the pace and holding sterile (but beautifully composed!) images for an eternity. It reminded me a bit of Zabriskie Point in that respect.<br />Irony of this movie is that the shell shocked wife and the homophobic husband next door are more endearing than the central family, that is until he turns out to be an abusive repressed self hating homosexual homocidal nazi fantasist (doh). Can't Alan Ball write an oppressive and domineering father without adding these ridiculous traits? What kind of idiocy is this? I always thought that the mindsets mocked in Woody Allen films were a myth, turns out they exist! They belong to Hollywood writers. Kids, if your father is strict PLEASE take heed of this film, check under his bed for the copy of the protocols of the elders of zion and examine your shower unit because the moment he hits you when he finds out you're involved in drugs he's not far from shooting someone dead. I'm only being as immature as the script.<br />You can argue that the scripts childish exaggerations are necesary to make the film's points hit home (what points?) and create some kind of violent dramatic finale where the protagonist is gunned down (even good american films like Affliction will resort to this, fine, because in that film it is justified) and life affirming realisations and epihanies occur. But really it's an awful lot easier to write such ridiculous characters than actually writing anything genuine and of substance. One can entertain the notion that it is a witty subversion, or a parody of sorts but the truth is its just a very weak piece of self adoring (without any concievable justification) satire with ideas above its station.  it's a smug, facile mediocre comedy that believes itself to be important, its not 'art' (or even very entertaining its so torturously slow and self impressed), it's not anything approaching the 'truth' and it sure isn't a 'wake up call' to any nation.<br />And as for the plastic bag in the breeze... Dude, deep, metaphorical. 'Look Closer', tried, nothing to see here, move along. And they reckon foreign language films are pretentious. The thanking of the plastic bag (apprarently without irony) upon the award of the oscar was truly hilarious. There was gushing, crying and hugging that somehow avoided the mockery that Halle Berry, Gwyneth Paltrow and other embarassing blubberers provoked. Only the 'Life is beautiful' 'director' and his academy award winning performance (and no i am not talking about his acting in the film) have nauseated me more, and to be honest i suspect that was more to do with the film than his live antics. Nice to see quite a few positive reviews of this film on this page resort to abusing (sometimes with name calling! oooh! others with Oscar Wilde) those that didn't find it to be the masterpiece they maintain. <br />And as for the drug dealing teen, i'm sure all of you suburbanites out there knew drug dealers when you were younger, were any of them like this guy? Did they have everything together? Were they competent and business like? Not the ones i knew, they were walking a tightrope most of the time, totally disorganized in all aspects of their life. He's been in a Psychiatric institution for a couple of years and as a result he's totally at ease with himself (?)<br />Really if it weren't for a couple of excellent comic performances this film would be utterly worthless. Mendes next film 'The Road To Perdition' with its reverent self importance, silent gun battles in torrential rain and 'carry on dillinger' second half was pretty awful too, but he's young, handsome and british with a theatrical background who pened his film career with a massive success, so he's a big talent who will be around for a long time doubtless continuing to receive mindboggling comparisons to Orson Welles for as long as his critical stock lasts (hm, apart form anything else i thought Citizen Kane was a box office flop?). Kevin Spacey has since made one of the worst films of its decade 'Ordinary Decent Criminal' and some of us have sat through the excruciating 'Pay it Forward' on vhs, does this guy need a wake up call or what? He's fast dissappearing up his own oscar. But he is critically untouchable it seems, these films didn't even register.<br />And remember... Keep watching the plastic bags!!!
1558908382|5.0|Ah...what's not to like here...you have Cusack...you have Driver...you have Cusack for a second time in the form of Joan:  John's sister...you have Aykroyd...it's all there in cinematic bliss.  Let me begin shall I?<br />Gross Pointe, I guess its somewhere in Michigan, suburbs of Detroit the Motor City, home of Rock and Roll, or at least the Detroit-ites may say so.  Minnie Driver is a cool local yokel radio announcer with her own stream-of-consciousness style.  Martin Blank, played by Cusack, is a professional killer.  Now wait right there, he's a professional killer with scruples mind you; he turns down a hit on a Greenpeace boat, so he can't be all bad.  Regardless of the profession, he has come to a place in life (it just so happens to coincide with his ten-year high school reunion) where he realizes he is a man without a rudder, without a moral compass, without a woman to love (at least one that he sees daily), and quickly losing his job satisfaction...the joy of the kill, so to speak.<br />There's everything to love in this movie.  There's dry witty humor.  There's originality in spades.  It just reflects the sad state of affairs in Hollywood that this movie tries to be everything...comedy, love, drama, violence.  Did I say violence?  Well with a professional hit man as the lead what did you expect?  Don't worry you Amazonites out there that are movie purists, the shooting and action is all tongue and cheek, all \\"they wouldn't let me make this film unless I threw in some gratuitous action\\" purity.  If this sounds like an incoherent rant, it is.  But then so is Cusack's dialogue spewing forth philosophy, spewing forth regrets and hope, spewing forth unique words and an even more unique take on life.<br />I broke in to the digital age recently by getting a DVD.  Grosse Pointe Blank, along with High Fidelity, and Pearl Jam's Single Video Theory were on the short list for first buys.  Grosse Pointe stands out (second to Pearl Jam of course...hey it's Pearl Jam) as a favorite.  It's not a work of art, though very stylishly done...it's something more: a movie to love and quote.  A movie to curl up to and claim at the office...that's my favorite.<br />It's got 80's underground playing along in the background with Siouxsie and the Banshees, The Clash, Bowie, the Violent Femmes.  If you were born in the late 60's, graduated in the mid to late 80's, the movie will take you back with some nostalgia, all the while being modern, all the while making you laugh and fall in love with Driver just as Cusack does.  What more can you ask out of a movie?  See it...you'll see.a favorite.  It's not a work of art, though very stylishly done...it's something more: a movie to love and quote.

B00003CX9Q|4.0|Where do I even start?  E.T. is probably the best movie to have ever been created. The night I saw E.T., my perspective on life was changed forever.  Before the 'T' Man (That's what I like to call my bud E.T.) I used to collect barbie dolls and watch moths mate in my windowsills. (Of course that isn't a very good way for a 47 year old man like myself to pick up women. Nights would pass, I would ponder the meaning of life as I lined up my barbies for a tea party.  I was always devastated when Ken showed up, I got so jealous.  He always stole Barbie from me. One night I set his corvette on fire to get even.  <BR>Anyway, back to 'T'.  He has inspired me so.  During the lowest times in my life when I about hit rock bottom, T lifted me up.<BR>T overcame his struggles as a young street tough from the projects.  He used to sell lemonade by the spoonful to the chimney sweepers.  If that is not enough to inspire you, there must be something wrong.  Buy ET.
B00006J3T4|5.0|I was taken somewhat by surprise by the release of this album. A big DS and MK fan, I guess I assumed that it was just way too close to STP for MK to be releasing new stuff. The increased pace of his activity has not dimmed MK's star, though; in fact, for my money, this is a far better album than STP (to give you a point of reference: GH is one of my all-time favorite albums, while I think STP is good but not great).<br />The first track (and probably only single) `Why Aye Man' is wonderfully catchy and shows off a great guitar lick that is somehow simultaneously boppy and redolent of scotland, with whose sons it is chiefly concerned.<br />Other highlights include the dark and powerful Hill Farmer's Blues, the nostalgic whimsy of A Place Where We Used To Live,<BR>the title track, and Old Pigweed. I strongly suspect that when I've been listening to the album more than one day I'll add a few more tracks to that list :-)
0316776963|5.0|I was laughing out loud so much that I couldn't read it on my way to work because other people on the train would give strange looks, it is THAT funny! He is hilarious and it helps if you've ever heard one of Mr. Sedaris' readings on NPR. It's a lot better to read this book with his voice in your head, with his intonations and sarcasms.
B00005JKBB|5.0|I really like this movie. I had to watch it a few times to catch all the action, now I watch it for the ejoyment of watching the Cat and Mouse game Redford plays with the CIA, especially with Chuck. Great action, I like the way it was filmed with the flashbacks. I'm a Redford fan and this one is worth buying.
B00006JJ2Y|4.0|I have been a Lou Reed fan for a few years now.  David Bowie<BR>got me into the Velvet Underground, as the Velvet Underground <BR>got me into Lou Reed.  The first Lou Reed album I got into was Transformer, which I consider to be his best next to Rock n' Roll animal.  Berlin is fantastic, but just doesn't equal Transformer or Animal.  Lou Reed's self-titled debut was good, but not even up to Berlin's standards.  Some fans love Reed for his raw and energetic lyrics, those fans are who would enjoy this CD.  Coming out after Street Hassle in 1978, this CD is Lou Reed's last triumph.  Bells wasn't even close to being as good artisticly.  From the first track, &quot;Sweet Jane,&quot; to the end is a comedic, riveting, and edgy experience.  The hits aren't sang with full lyrics, but the improv is what makes the album.  Way to go Reed!!  I can't give this album a '5' because it is not perfect in any way as Transformer or Animal, but a '4' is great to me.
B00003CXI1|5.0|There shouldn't be any reason that you DON'T have this DVD, if you're a fan.  There's no excuse.  If you're not, I would say its because you haven't read the books.  The movie was a bit of a imaginative letdown, but that has nothing to do with the quality of the product. Its great.
0393314804|5.0|\\"Trainspotting\\", first and best of Irvine Welsh's novels, tells a series of loosely linked stories about the gadges, radges, junkies and wide-os in Edinburgh.  <BR>This book shows what Edinburgh is really like - forget all the purple heather, the bonnie lasses, kilts, bagpipes and killing the English - this is drinking, swedging, mainlining, shagging and doing over your mates.  <BR>Written in a heavy Scots vernacular, the books blend of humour and horror provide an exhilerating experience.
B00004HYLF|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite albums. To me, this is the high water mark for this group. The musicianship is top-notch. Outside of Frank Zappa, I never heard anyone combine so many genres.  I saw them perform the whole album live in Philadelphia at the Tower, and you would have swore they used some overdubbing or some modern digital/tape tricks...Ive always loved Chick and the various incarnations of RTF, but this is the one....Im a keyboardist, so after hearing this album, I gave up trying to become a jazz/rock fusionist. I just finally realized I just could not compete with the astounding virtuosity these guys had....Oh, I went on to have a minor music career, though....Yeah, playing funk in bar bands....Right.
0060930187|4.0|Let me first say that in rating this novel, I waffled back and forth between 4 and 5 stars. I finally decidedo n 4 stars, but it could just as easily have been 5.<br />Sylvia Plath made a name for herself with her poetry and this, her only novel. She was one of the confessionalist poets, along with Anne Sexton, she studied with Robert Lowell. The Bell Jar carries her confessionalistic work into fiction. This is based pretty heavily on her life. The Bell Jar is like a Catcher in the Rye for girls. It's pretty well written, though you can tell it is an inexperienced novelist. It is a shame she killed herself so young, because not only was she a great poet, but she had such potential to become a great fiction writer. Plath successfully carries us down into insanity with her protagonist. The narration works very well in keeping the reader as disjointed as our heroin (It's similiar to One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest in that matter, only not to the extreme--and it paints a prettier and more approving picture of the mental health system of the time). We never get a good idea as to why the breakdown occurs, but as in real life, these matters are often confusing. My biggest problem with the book isn't the somewhat juvenile style of writing, but it is the ending of the novel. It seems a little to pat. We don't feel that the narrator has worked through her problems, or that her mental health should be better, it just sort of becomes better. Plath should have spent a little more time working out the ending. But it is a fine novel, one that I enjoyed.
B00005NGAL|4.0|I confess, I am i complete CATS fan.  I love the musical and have seen the video countless times. The dancing is fabulous, the singing and characters were great too. The only thing I found disappointing was that most of the songs were cut short and they took out Growltiger's scene completely, which I thought was one of the best scenes. Overall, it's still a great show to watch on video.<BR>If you have not seen CATS before, or have seen it and didn't enjoy it, I can't blame you. I didn't enjoy it the first time i watched it, but I managed to get the lyrics of the songs off the net and information about the musical, so when I understood it better, I enjoyed it more. You'd be surprised how many websites there are out there dedicated to CATS. So if you didn't enjoy it 'cause you didn't understand it, I recommend getting hold of the lyrics and plot of the musical. It helps!
0671027344|5.0|Like so many others have said, this is one of the best books I have ever read.  I have bought this book for at least three people, and everyone has loved it.

B00000BKI4|4.0|I had heard this was suppossed to be a great band but never paid much attention to them until after i heard Harmony Rockets \\"Paralyzed Mind...\\"  <BR>I was expecting a darker more sinister sound from this LP to match its excellent cover photo.<BR>So I was taken aback by the Disney'esque Fantasia sound of it all including the high childlike vocals.<BR>Now I can say it is a above average cd, I really like the first 5 songs, they really flow nicely together, but \\"The Hudson Line\\" sounds like a bad PHISH cover, it sucks.  The last song \\"Delta Bottleneck Stomp\\" is also sort of annoying, its like some RUSTED ROOT {crud}.<br />Despite these 2 songs The album overall is good.  It has an overall original sound  with some catchy tracks like \\"Opus 40\\", \\"Goddess On A Hiway\\", and some very dreamlike tracks like the first couple and \\"Funny Bird\\"<br />I would say that this is a cross between WEEN's, stoner child like humor, SPIRITUALIZED's spacy psychedelics but with its own unique pop sensibilities.<br />Go ahead and see if you like this record but don't take it as seriously as the cover photo would have you believe...

B000056VIY|3.0|I know a lot of people probably started some serious eye rolling after reading my review title, but this album is better than most people think. I'm not saying you should drop what you're doing and go pick it up, but for the most part it's worth hearing.<br />First things first: not to be funny or disrespectful toward anyone, but if you buy a Jennifer Lopez album expecting knockout vocals, you need to check yourself. It doesn't sound like she's trying as hard to please listeners on this album, but that's actually a good thing because on her first album it sounded like she was trying TOO hard. Instant standouts on this album are the simple and smooth \\"Secretly\\", as well as \\"I'm Real\\" and \\"Love Don't Cost A Thing\\". \\"Play\\" is okay, but it was co-written by Christina Milian, and if you don't like Christina's song \\"AM To PM\\" (which I don't), you may not like this.<br />All in all, I think most of these songs are worth listening to at least once (except for maybe \\"Walking On Sunshine\\" and the bumpy &quot;That's Not Me&quot;); and if not that, the songs other than the standouts I mentioned are good for background music. This album may not win Album of the Year, but it IS an improvement on her part.

Every word she writes seems to be written just for me...we are not alone!!! ... and we are loved!

0064407667|5.0|Have you ever thought you had the worst luck on the face of this planet?  You should try reading \\"The Bad Beginning\\".  The Bauldelaire children have bad luck by the fifth page, and it only goes downhill from there.  It's not all bad though, some parts are very clever and bring you hope for the children.  Lemony Snicket does a great job of bringing you into the story and making you feel like you are one of the children.  When they are happy, you are happy.  When they are sad, you are sad.  The emotions get passed around like a communion tray.  This book is a must-read! :)
B000005RFI|5.0|It sounds better than when I bought it on vinyl over 30 years ago. The remastered version of this album is superb. You ain't never heard Paranoid till you hear it here.
B00005JKNF|4.0|I have read the many reviews, good and not-so-good, and found myself laughing at the not-so-good ones.  It appears that many viewers \\"just didn't get it\\".  Altman did not make a \\"real whodonit\\" mystery movie.  He made a movie reflecting the everyday life of society in 1930's England--the upperclass or upstairs group, and the servant or downstairs group.  The murder is just another subplot in the many subplots of the film.  I found the direction seamless--the flow between showing life upstairs to that of life downstairs was invisible.  The actors portrayed their character's part to perfection.  Just look at Helen Mirren's performance and tell me you couldn't differentiate between the actor and the character.  For my money, I would have given Mirren the Oscar.  I love these types of movies that delve into character acting.  I find too few of them on today's market which produce more movies about special effects and explosions and less on character study.  I thoroughly enjoyed listening to Jeremy Northam sing and play.  I understand a couple of the songs were done \\"live\\"; that is, he did not record them first in a sound studio but rather was filmed as he sang and played.  I saw the film twice at the theatre and several more times when I bought the DVD recently.  I encourage readers to check out the commentary track done by the writer, Julian Fellowes.  His description of the movie is very revealing and interesting.  Many of the scenes were taken from 'real life' experiences, such as the opening scene.  He describes how his aunt would never let her driver attach the roof over his head on the car, even if it was raining.  He said she always wanted to preserve the rank of distinction.  Altman's commentary is a bit dry and he does not go into too much detail in many areas.  I would have given this movie 5 stars except I found the sound quality not very good on the DVD.  I had to turn up the volume quite a bit on my entertainment centre to properly hear the dialogue.  Otherthan poor sound quality, I recommend readers to review this film, especially with the commentary track by Julian Fellowes.
B00006AG5N|3.0|Elvis wasnt the true King of rock and roll - he was a lazy Redneck who didnt write his own songs and barely played guitar! All he did was shake his hips and [bottom]on TV and the movie screen and the girls went crazy. <br />Buddy Holly, Chuck Berry, Fats Domino, Carl Perkins, Roy Orbison, Johnny Cash, Little Richard and many Doo-Wop groups all wrote/co wrote thier own material and didnt make that many dumb movies. The guy was a awesome singer but as a complete talent he is totally overated in my book! I dont know why so many old ladies love him...   <br />This could have been the CD that would have converted millions of teenagers into die-hard Elvis fans. The probelem is that the brain dead compilers should have ignored what was a #1 hit and stuck to ROCK tracks and dumped most of the ballads. Songs like \\"It's Alright Mama\\" \\"My Baby Left Me\\", \\"Party\\" and \\"Little Sister\\" should have been included. Instead we get junk like \\"Wooden Heart\\" and \\"The Wonder Of You\\"... songs kids used to Backstreet and The A*Teens will think are too \\"mushy\\" and skip right over. <br />BTW The sound quality is outstanding, a huge improvement over the old RCA CD's that were released in the 80's. Those CD's had way too many tape drop-outs and noise processing.<br />As for the Remix of \\"A Little Less Conversation\\" I though it was fantastic! - I would love to see more dance mixes of classic 50's and 60's oldies. Who gives a rat's [rear end] if they are dead? - take thier vocal tracks and add a hot slammin' Hip-Hop dance beat and turn people on to who have never heard thier music before. I would love to hear more Elvis tracks remixed.
B00006FXB6|4.0|When listening to this I can't stop thinking thinking these guys are like a cross between Uriah Heep and Stone Temple Pilots.  I really like it but it seems a little too contrived (or as we used to say in the 70's - over produced).  It would be that much better if it had a rougher edge.  My favourite track is Song for the Deaf - it has one of the best lead solo breaks I have ever heard. Definitely worth buying.
B00005UEAR|5.0|First off, this whole 2-disc set kicks so much [booty]. but I cant believe how many people are dismissing the first disc. The riffs, hooks, solos, and arrangements in the first four tracks are phenominal. I dont care so much for track 5. Disc 1 is definetly the standout for me. The Great Debate has its weak moments but other than that the disc sends shivers down my spine even after countless listens. The more I hear it the more entertaining it becomes. Disc 2 is great also, but the music thats really happening is on disc 1. But then again, who am I to tell you what to like.
B00006J3WH|5.0|OK, so big suprise, the cast of Buffy can sing pretty darn good!  I don't think anybody expected Joss Whedon's musical episode from season 6 to be such a big hit.  Here in their uncut format are the songs from this epsidode.  These are the greatest songs.  They have all the wit and fun of the show.  And the bonus track of Joss Whedon and his wife singing the demo of Something to Sing About is a must have for those hardcore Buffy fans.  Pick this album up today, you won't regret it.
B00006J3WH|4.0|I taped the musical on VHS and then recorded the music on a cassette I was so desperate to have this music.  Now I have the CD I play it all the time.  I am amazed how well these actors can sing.
B00005Y228|5.0|Finally!  Dance/pop music that isn't offered on the silicone chest of an untalented teenybopper!  I had all but forgotten about Minogue until her release of \\"Can't Get You Out of My Head.\\"  Since I couldn't get it out of mine, I picked up the CD, and actually listened to it all the way through on the first spin.  I was blown away by this sexy, classy Aussie with her breathy voice and delicious beats.  It instantly became THE disc to have playing 24/7.  I soon began snatching up any of Kylie's records I could get my hands on, and they all have one defining trait.  They're all fabulous with great songs.  How many times have you bought a CD for one song and the rest was awful?  You won't find that here or on any of Minogue's previous releases.<br />Bottom line?  Fun pop, great beats and a rewarding sense of unabashed fun.  Couldn't recommend it more!
B0000640VO|5.0|This is the life of Amelie Pulain, a very normal french girl whose destiny is to try and make her friends' lives better by a series of schemes, while trying to find a meaning to her own life.<br />There are some very good scenes and the production of the movie is terrific. The story is a little bit nonsense, but it is funny, specially the part about the garden dwarf. Although we can't say the acting is terrific, the photography makes up to creat a visually spectacular movie. Audrey Tautou's face is expressive and likeable, but the girl who does Amelie as a kid steals the movie.<br />Very colorful and a light enterteinment.<br />Grade 8.5/10

0316666343|5.0|I was reluctant to read this book, given the premise, but I was hooked right away, from the first paragraph and finished it in less than two days. I couldn't put it down. While there were a couple of spots where it was hard to suspend disbelief, for the most part I found the book touching, and sometimes painful.  It was wonderfully written and I found that the characters were people I could care about. I think this is a really wonderful book.
079213690X|5.0|A sweeping historical epic, BRAVEHEART is as entertaining and riveting today as it was when first released in 1995.  Although the film contains some eyebrow-raising historical revision, Mel Gibson successfully conveys the struggle for Scottish independence from England in the late 13th Century.  Backed by the impoverished masses, William Wallace faces not only the tyranny of King Edward the Longshanks (played masterfully by Patrick McGoohan), but the spineless Scottish nobles, whose insatiable greed for land and title from the English crown spells doom for any independence movement.<br />From majestic shots of the Scottish highlands, to heartracing battle scenes, to character portrayals that draw the viewer directly into the story, BRAVEHEART is compelling, brilliant film making at its best.  Highly recommended for viewing, again and again.
B0000542D2|3.0|THEY HAVE TAKEN A PERFECTLY GREAT FILM..AND RUINED IT AGAIN..<BR>FIRST TIME..THEY TOOK OFF THE ORIGINAL SOUNTRACK AND PUT ON A DIGITAL STEREO ONE...GEE THANKS!!<BR>NOW THEY HAVE TAKEN THAT SOUNDTRACK AND RUINED THAT ONE!!!<BR>HOW??? LISTEN TO THE \\"ECHO\\" ON THE SONGS THAT ARE SUNG \\"LIVE\\" AT THE END..IS THAT NEEDED?? WHY NOT HAVE THE ORIGINAL MONO TRACK AS WELL AS THE STEREO ONE? BUT DON'T SCREW WITH IT..<BR>MAYBE A LAUGH TRACK ON HELP????
0679777547|3.0|If I had to put it down to one sentence, it would have to be \\"this should have been Umberto Eco's second novel instead of Focault's Pendulum\\". Indeed, Eco is alluded to 3 times throughout this novel, twice indirectly (\\"the professor of semiotics from Bologne\\", \\"brother William Baskerville\\"), and certainly the Dumas Club has the sort of intrigue, mystery and occult conspiracy that we tend to enjoy in Eco's work.<BR>The creation of the antiquarian bookdealing underworld is marvelous as is the book \\"The Nine Doors\\". For a while however, I was concerned that this book would have a nebulous type of ending that is more appealing to literature than genre. But in keeping with the spirit of the detection/adventure genre, the author delivers the goods.<BR>Two things make this book interesting as a mystery novel.  Firstly, two streams of plotline dovetail and momentarily seem to converge before splintering off again - unusual but fascinating. Secondly, there is more than one villain revealed (the first more fun and surprising than the second).<BR>Yet the low rating I have given is because somehow upon reaching the end you are left rather undernourished, as most of the loose ends are tied-up. It seems that the book's individual parts are greater than it's sum, to reverse a popular saying. Still, it is a joy to make the journey for which alone I would give 5 stars. 3 stars for the resolutions.<BR>By the way, I think the young mysterious and beautiful girl, understandably a literary device, smells too much of a midlife-crisis fantasy than anything else.
B00006690G|4.0|.... He changed his sound some, but tried not to take out his rebellious and witty appeal. It worked, although some might have hoped for more witty Real Slim Shady style tracks. The best thing about it is that he's gotten more mature. He doesn't use so much shock value anymore to stay cool. He still swears, of course, and the occasional song like Drips pushes it, but for the most part he's calmed down. He writes about his issues with all the women in his life, most of which he hates, and the hardships of being an insanely huge star. No more drug balads. He even sings in one song, and is more in tune than you might think even though his voice isn't suited to it. At the same time, there's some funny/crazy songs to add in variety. There's also a few \\"I'm such a great rapper\\" songs that every rapper puts on every album. There's a song with Dre and a song with D-12. All in all, there's a good variety, but no truly disurbing songs that convince you he's going to hell. White America is probably as bad as it gets, so the worst is over at the beginning. He's matured, calmed down, and basically improved. Some people are getting sick of Eminem, and they shouldn't get this, but if you're still willing to give him a chance you should defenitely pick this up.<br />Closing comments:Its slightly pathetic how even in his sweet song he talks about how he hates his wife.
0151008116|4.0|Named after a Parisian swimming pool, Piscine Molitor Patel is growing up in Pondicherry, India. When he tires of being called \\"Pissing\\" by cruel children and well-meaning teachers who mispronounce his first name, he begins calling himself \\"Pi.\\" <br />His father, head of the Pondicherry Zoo, teaches Pi and his older brother, Ravi, to respect both the power and the unpredictability of wild animals. Other life lessons follow, as young Pi experiments with religion as a Hindu, a Muslim and a Christian, in his quest to draw nigh to God. <br />When Pi is sixteen, his father sells the zoo and makes plans to move his family to Canada. His wife and two sons reluctantly join him on the Tsimtsum, the Japanese cargo ship transporting animals from the defunct zoo. <br />One night, Pi hears a noise that jolts him from his sleep. Unable to rouse Ravi, he sets off to investigate. It becomes clear that the ship is sinking, but rising water prevents Pi from warning his family. Crewmembers thrust him toward a lifeboat just before the Tsimtsum succumbs to the Pacific. <br />Orphaned and stunned, Pi drifts in the lifeboat with a huge tiger named Richard Parker, an orangutan named Orange Juice, an ugly hyena and a beautiful Zebra with a broken leg. <br />Soon after, the hyena kills the zebra and the orangutan. Richard Parker emerges from his den at the bottom of the lifeboat and kills the hyena. <br />Terrified Pi somehow establishes awkward boundaries with the tiger and is spared. As the lifeboat drifts in the blue water, Pi faces life, death and miracles - all of which bring him closer to God. <br />\\"The Life of Pi\\" is an amazing adventure written with intelligence and grit. As Pi makes his trek toward land, the reader takes an unbelievable rollercoaster ride. Martel is one of six authors shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize for Fiction 2002, the UK's best known literary award for \\"The Life of Pi.\\"
B00003CXI1|4.0|I went into this movie thinking it was going to be terrible - but I was instantly whisked away into the fantasy world of Harry Potter.  After seeing the movie, I read all the books, and am, whether I like it or not, a fan of the HP series.<br />The DVD is great - there's lots of extras that you'll enjoy finding.  I'm still discovering new bits myself!<br />If you liked the books, this is a very good representation - very true to the story.  And, it's great for adults and kids, though it might be a bit scary for very young children.
B00005AFMT|5.0|So Robert Fripp, after taking time off of music and collaborating with artists such as David Bowie and Peter Gabriel, he met a few musicians to work with and formed a band called Discipline, though eventually it became.. King Crimson. <BR><BR>The new lineup was consisted of a few well rounded musicians who worked with many groundbreaking artists. <BR><BR>First, returning to the fold with Fripp, was drummer Bill Bruford. Before joining King Crimson in late 1972, he had attained stardom with Yes. After Crimson's initial breakup in 1975, he played drums in Genesis on their first tour since Peter Gabriel had left the band in 1975, and went on to do a solo career. <BR><BR>Then the new bassist was Tony Levin. He worked on John Lennon's final solo album &quot;Double Fantasy,&quot; every Peter Gabriel before or since 1981, and artists such as Tom Waits, memebrs of Dream Theater and his own solo career. He also was an innovator at the &quot;Chapman stick&quot; an odd, bass-like, 12-stringed instrument, which is used very well in the opening song &quot;elephant talk.&quot; <BR><BR>Rounding out the line-up is Adrian Belew, fresh out of Frank Zappa's band. He too went on to a solo career, and worked with Tori Amos, Nine Inch Nails and probably a bunch of other people. He also was the group's vocalist/lyricist.<BR><BR>As for the music, it sounds like New Wave gone terribly wrong, in a pleasant way, with weird guitar lines/effects, dissonance, electronic drums, avant-garde jamming, and some pretty good instrumentals. A great album by a great band, and one of their best.Buy it for yourself. I can't explain this album.. it's that good.
0446608955|1.0|I was looking for 0 stars and could not find it. Immaturity at its irritating best.
B000002J1C|5.0|This has everything I look for in a rock record; memorable songs, great musicianship (simple, complex, doesnt matter), and something that keeps you entertained throughout the album. <BR><BR>With the addition of the reserved guitar god Steve Howe, a virtuoso in fingerpicking, Yes was complete. Rick Wakeman joined the band a year later to create the 'definitive Yes lineup,&quot; but this lineup is fantastic. <BR><BR>Jon Anderson's vocals were perfect on this album, and some of his lyrics even meant something rather than the nonsense he wrote of in later albums like &quot;Topographic Oceans.&quot; Chris Squire's bass work is awesome as usual, and Bill Bruford's drumming is something to be greatly complemented. Though he left after 2 more albums to join the avant-garde prog-rock band King Crimson, his jazz-influenced drumming was perfect for this album. Tony Kaye is no Rick Wakeman, but unlike some Wakeman stuff, he doesn't go overboard with the keys at all. He uses a simple organ, piano (the intro to &quot;A Venture&quot; has some of the greatest piano swirls ever), and Moog synthesizer.<BR><BR>And the songs are arguably the most coherent in their days as art-rock heroes (1971-1975) before they overindulged in sonic and soothing soundscapes and noodling, which wasn't bad. Songs like &quot;Yours Is No Disgrace,&quot; &quot;Starship Trooper,&quot; and &quot;Perpetual Change&quot; all have parts that fit the song perfectly, and those 3 aforementioned songs are over the 9 minute mark, but it doesn't draw out at all. <BR><BR>To me this is Yes' definitive album, and perhaps their best. Along w/ Nursery Cryme by Genesis, this ranks as the beginning to true progressive rock, and a paradigm of what most albums (prog or otherwise) should be.
B00005JKDR|5.0|I never thought an animated character could be as absolutely adorable as Boo is...as an adult, I was hooked from the moment I saw Sully's animated fur blowing back and forth as he snored.  As a parent, I just had to see Boo's eyes.  My daughter is 3 1/2 and loves this movie.  She gets a little scared at times, but the movie is done in a way that she realizes it is all in good fun.
B000003S0P|5.0|By far, the heaviest album in King Crimson's very diverse and unpredictable output, and also the last album in their initial 5 year lifespan (1969-1974). Robert Fripp had enough of the constant revolving-door lineups he had endured and got tired of the music industry itself. For someone so angry at music, he, and his bandmates (John Wetton: bass/vocals, Bill Bruford: drums, David Cross: violin, left before this album was finished) made a loud exit from the music industry. <BR><BR>The heavy opening title track is one of the best heavy metal songs ever, even though Crimson was a far cry from metal, or even hard rock. &quot;Fallen Angel,&quot; and &quot;One More Red Nightmare,&quot; also have pounding rhythms, blaring guitars/bass, and hectic vocals. It was almost like a dark, depressing and avant-garde version of Cream. &quot;Providence,&quot; is like something off of Larks Tongue In Aspic, or Starless and Bible Black, with David Cross(making his only entry on this album) playing his violin in a rather unconventional manner. The final track &quot;Starless,&quot; is eerily quiet, with a beautiful, spacey mellotron, a guitar lick by Robert Fripp that is instantly memorable, before breaking into an improvised and unbelievably loud middle section with an appearance by Ian McDonald, a former band member who left in 1970(?) and later went on to join Foreigner, on sax. Then it all comes crashing down to a loud and aggressive halt. <BR><BR>King Crimson disbaded at the end of 1974, but would later reform in 1981, when they did their odd brand of new-wave/art rock. But this stands as a great album to finish a turmoiled and unstable career.. at least for 7 years. <BR><br />Oh, and supposedly before Kurt Cobain committed suicide in 1994, he had been listening to Red a lot.
B00006G8K0|5.0|First-rate Hammer treatment of \\"Dracula\\" and literally where it all began for the famous British studio. Warner Bros. presents it finally on DVD and it looks and sounds splendid in widescreen. This shows why Christopher Lee was matchless as the undead count and Peter Cushing was the ideal choice for the unflappable Van Helsing and so many \\"sequels\\" were spawned in it's wake. Some were good but this is the real thing. Only fault---the back cover of the snap case features a shot of Stephanie Beacham from \\"Dracula A.D.-1972\\"!!! This glaringly stupid error will anger some fans and no doubt confuse those seeing this for the first time. However, the goods are fine and the music intact with that unmistakeable Hammer sound. A bloody good show all the way around. Gobble this up before it disappears from the shelves.
B000068TPN|5.0|I don't know that any movie can EVER capture a war, a battle, or a skirmish. I was never a soldier BUT this is one of the best films of i have ever seen that tried to depict the Vietnam War in all of its human-ness, humane-ness and soldier \\"spirit\\" before it all went so wrong. This is not going to be the last movie that is made about Vietnam and I don't know if any movie will be able to capture everything that was right or wrong about that war. But this was the first movie that gave me a sliver of an idea about what this war meant to the \\"real\\" soldiers that tried to fight this war and what it might have been like to be proud of what they did over there. This was also the only movie I have EVER seen that tried to show the effects of battle on the military wives and their families. <BR>Cudos to Mr. Wallace for his effort!
B00006AL1G|5.0|ok i missed this movie in theaters but i heard how it covers the history of djing and all that and its the best for showing you where scratching got started and i bought the dvd and its true this movie is BOMB!! with mixmastermike and dj qbert and all the rest.. SCRATCH is a totally amazing & informative 1&1/2hour ride.<br />but then i got to disc 2! theres a whole nother part with lessons on how to scratch from dj qbert and dj z-trip. also theres part of the WAVE TWISTERS movie and other dj footage. if theSCRATCH movie doesnt make you want to go out and buy turntables (and it will!) the 2nd disc of the dvd will!
B000009MF7|5.0|The cover photograph on this CD shows Messieurs Boulez and Zimerman beaming from ear to ear as well they might for the top ranking work they have done on these concerti. The Ravel concerti have received fine treatment on other CDs but no matter how many other interpretations you have; this CD will be a most worthy addition. Zimerman is a technical wizard receiving knowing support from Boulez and sumptuous DG sound. Highest recommendation.
B00004TWZF|1.0|A long boring movie with an annoying ending. Some of the photography was good, and seemed to have more character than the characters.<br />Avoid this movie at all costs!

0871137380|5.0|The subtitle of the book, &quot;A Story Of Modern War&quot; is what really caught my attention when I decided to purchase this book. I read Mark Bowden's excellent book shortly before the movie and then again after the movie. Mr. Bowden displayed an unbiased view that I find really hard to get when your reading war novels. I think that a modern war involves all the sides and this book is great. I think that you can read this more than once and take something from it each time. It does not matter of you are a history buff or a military general, this book will teach you about leadership and more importantly life.
0898705525|5.0|Chesterton shows us that God doesn't fit into anyone's box -- and that true faith is the most exciting & perilous thing of all. To truly believe leads us to truly live. This book is as witty as it is insightful -- and deserves to be read multiple times. It has had a profound influence on my view of God and has made the Him seem larger. A fascinating read.
B00005QK3W|5.0|Driving Rain is definitely one of Paul's best works.  However, it is an album that you need to listen to a couple of times to really appreciate it.  If you are expecting a bunch of silly love songs, this isn't the album.  It is edgy, artistic and different.  Paul's voice as always is in top form, and the instrumentation is terrific.  There are times when Paul puts out product, and you notice the difference.  I am a big time McCartney fan, to me, he is the mastermind of the Beatles, but in his solo work, there are times when you listen to something and you say, jeez, you really need to be a fan to listen to this (see Red Rose Speedway, Pipes of Peace, and Press to Play)  But there are others that are so brilliant, (Band on the Run, Tug of War, etc.) that you realize what a genius this guy is.  I don't mean to speak of the dead in a poor manner, but Linda dying and him falling in love with Heather has done wonders for him artistically.  The thing I like about this album, is that you ask yourself, could you see the other Beatles making this song?  And most of the time the answer is yes.  (For example, I can't see John and Paul krishnaing along to George's My Sweet Lord, but I can see the Beatles doing Band on the Run.)  This album works.  And the tour was just as tremendous.  I saw him in Boston, and it was the 4th time I've seen him.  The songs off this album sound great live.  His voice is still top notch and he played 6 instruments.  Hopefully, some day this guy will get his due as the greatest all around musician in rock history.
0783117523|5.0|It was so heartbreaking to witness Gia achieve wealth &amp; fame only to live a self-destructing life. She may have had carried excess baggages from the past which she couldn't unload, but her unruly lifestyle not only continuously hurt the people around her but most importantly herself, which led to her own demise.  We are not here to judge what kind of person she was &amp; what kind of life she lived.  True, the modelling world is a glamorous world...a world of make believe.  But Gia &amp; the others are real people with real problems.  They are made even more vulnerable with their fame, isolation &amp; competition. Her sad plight only proves that happiness cannot be bought nor fame can yield.
B000056HRY|5.0|EXECUTIVE DECISION by Warner Studios with a running time of 133 minutes in color starring Kurt Russell and Halle Berry receives five stars from me because of the overall package that it gives to the viewer. It has suspense, action, and drama. I think the movie was real smooth in responding to the different situations that arose on the airplane and the resources that were used to aid them. The spy cams and sleepers are great. I was on the edge of my seat the entire show. Joe Morton was great also--who could diffuse a bomb with a broken neck. Halle Berry--wonderful job--brave in the face of adversity. However, to have the whole plane saved by a piece of plastic is just funny as ever, which gives it a little comical bit. <br />The only part that was confusing was that S. Seagal was killed out very early in the show and for someone of his stature, it seemed odd. <br />Overall, I just love this movie. It is the best.
B000002LIM|5.0|When looking at it, it was such a luck that Danny Elfman was the one to write the score for Batman. No one else could have done the same thing, integrating madness, danger, heroism and darkness into one amazing package. By now, Batman`s theme song is one of the best and well known in the world, up there with James Bond, Star Wars and Indiana Jones. <BR>The Soundtrack is not to be confused with Prince`s, which only contained non-score songs, aka songs that were not the background and theme songs in the movie. THIS however, is the real thing.<BR>It is very crisp and clear, a melancholy sound that is not beaten by anything Elfman has written in later years, in fact he has never succeeded Batman. The major highlights of this score is: The Batman theme, Batman to the Rescue, Descent into Mystery, The Bat Cave, Charge of the Batmobile..and in fact, all of the tracks from there are fantastic. The album cant be compared to anything released today, it just blows away all competition. If there is another Batman Movie, I would want Danny Elfman to score it again, after all he is the only one can.<br />Recommended over anything else.
0385335482|5.0|\\"Confessions of a Shopaholic\\" by Sophie Kinsella deals with Rebecca Bloomwood who is a financial journalist writing for Successful Saving. Her main problem is that she is a compulsive shopper and because of that, she gets herself into trouble with banks, the credit card company and she even owes money to her roommate Suze. Deep in debt, Rebecca is also depressed as she feels that her life is static, with a so-so career, no boyfriend and is constantly hassled by the banks and credit card companies urging her to pay. <br />Kinsella gives a good insight into the life of a shopaholic and how a person can get into serious trouble if she/he is not cautious. Not a shopaholic myself, I always find it difficult to understand how people can get into debt just by buying clothes, or any other things. Reading this book makes me realize that this habit can be considered a disease just like alcoholism. Even though shopaholics know that it is wrong to keep buying especially since the bank letters piled up, they seemed to have no self-control. The moral of the book is that, shop but have self-control and be moderate. I highly recommend this book for all the shopaholics and non-shopaholics out there. It doesn't matter which group you belong, you'll learn something from \\"Confessions of a Shopaholic.\\" Not to mention that it is highly entertaining.
630310696X|4.0|Philadelphia, 1993, 125 minutes, directed by Jonathan Demme.  Actors and Actresses include; Tom Hanks, Denzel Washington, Antonio Banderas, Roberta Maxwell, Buzz Kilman, Karen Finley, Daniel Chapman, Mark Sorensen, Jr., Jeffrey Williamson, Charles Glenn (1), Ron Vawter, Anna Deavere Smith, Stephanie Roth, Mary Steenburgen, Lisa Talerico, Joanne Woodward, Jason Robards and more.  <br />The film takes place in 1973 in Philadelphia, PA, the city of brotherly love.  The theme of the film consists of a man with AIDS fighting for his right to work although he is disabled with debilitating disease.  <br />The plot of the film involves a man with AIDS being terminated from his position as Senior Associate with a prestigious law firm in the city of Philadelphia.  Shortly after he is promoted to Senior Associate of the law firm and given the most important case the law firm has ever received, he is terminated from his employment with the law firm.  The genre of the film is a drama.<br />I would give this film four star.  I believe the film deserves four stars because of the truth of the AIDS disease it brought forward to our society.  This was a very empowering film.  Although at the time of its release, AIDS was though of a disease you could contract by just touching a person with AIDS, this film opened up the eyes of our society by showing that AIDS is a disease just like Cancer and Heart Disease.

078401213X|4.0|This is not a movie for everyone. It must be understood but nevertheless it makes you wonder if such a thing would really be possible than life would be explained with mathematical precision. Unfortunately Because of quantum mechanics's uncertainty principle it is mostly sure not possible to come up with a predictability formula as this movie shows. Overall: VERY GOOD.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|From all of Iron Maidens records, this is probably the one I play most. The reason? Spinesending, shivering music that breaks your bones and glues them together again with Dickinsons voice.<br />It was an amazing comeback. One could not want anything else, and even though it was hard to believe, this record put every other comeback albums to shame. This is what they should sound like, melodic hard rockers, with a love for the music they write and play.<BR>It starts of with The Wicker Man, a fast rocker with a glorious chanting ending, that will make you nod your head and probably give you whiplash. It goes over to Ghost of the Navigator and Brave New World, something that sounds like a crossover between Virtua XIII and Seventh son songs, and those two songs are just two of the albums major highlights. Then we move on to Blood Brothers, a song that irritated me a bit the first times..but after listening to it on Rock in Rio, I started to like it more and more. Now I have to hear it. The STAR of the CD however, is the grandiose, wonderful, lunatic/nervous song called Dream of Mirrors. I will go so far and call this one of Maidens top 5 songs ever. It is over 9 minutes long, and on par scale with the Ancient Marineer, if not better. It starts off with this dark brooding feeling, and explodes into a superb chorus, a fantastic solo and drums that will make you wanna be a drummer. It shows Iron Maiden from a side we havent seen in over 15 years, it shows Iron Maiden as the best Heavy band out there.<br />Coming to an end, The cd takes a more relaxed style with &quot;The Thin line between love and hate&quot;, a moody song that leaves us only wanting for more.<br />To sum it up, Brave new world is one of the best heavy records since the new Century, it`s far better than Virtua and X Factor, it`s Maiden back to what we love them as, hard hitting, melodious rockers with a lust for music and a will to keep Heavy Metal Alive. And in the end, Iron Maiden is maybe the only one who can do it, and they prooved it with Brave new World. H&quot;ED&quot;S UP!
B00006IU73|5.0|On first listen it was obvious that in absentia was very much a sum of Porcupine Tree's last three studio albums, Signify, Stupid Dream and Lightbulb Sun. On all three albums there is somewhat of a theme that although never fully realized was still strong enough to justify it's own acclaim.<br />Let's break down the album.<br />Sound: absolutely stunning, although many elements from previous albums are present the glossy, cinematic sound pushes the ideas to a new level for Porcupine Tree. It can be put against any album on technical levels, let alone creative ones.<br />Idea: bleak songs, not wistful or sometimes playful, dark subject matter, inflicting pain, self loathing and an introduction into the mind of a killer have never sounded beautifully sung, even with a touch of sweetness and harmonies that remind of the Beach Boys gone to hell and playing in a band that has the intensity of a metal act when needed. It's smart, a bit seductive and overall seems like a amorphous kind of suite of songs. The &quot;official&quot; review talks about some of the songs bookending parts of the album and that does ring true although you get the sense that if Steve Wilson wasn't thematically writing he was either in one nasty mood or got incredibly lucky. I don't believe in luck on major label CDs<br />The music: when I mentioned cinematic earlier I meant it as in scope, compare your experience seeing a theater screen and the big sound system, then imagine experiencing it on a television set. It can still be a good experience but it won't be fantastic. <br />On first listen there were parts where I found myself saying, &quot;that would fit on Lightbulb Sun&quot;, or &quot;wow, that's a lot like Signify&quot; and then moments here and there would remind me of Stupid Dream....only better. And by better I mean in a tighter, more cohesive manner. There are still moments of instrumental brilliance but they are tighter and more focused. <br />Individually the songs work well but they work best as a whole. This is one of the only plus 60 minute CDs I can listen to and be involved 100%.<br />Now so far I've only hinted at the music. Ok, here goes. Reflective and pastoral sections lead into crushing riffs sounding not unlike a more mature Tool. There is drive and vigor in every song. It's like the child of Soundgarden's, Superunkown period meets classic rock with a twist of post rock experimentalism.<br />No blow by blow song reviews as this is a collection of songs meant to be heard that way and besides, this is the kind of CD that is best described in broad strokes of color and washes of sound and form. A lot of albums that attempt this fail because the actual songs are slaves to concept. Here we are dealing with songs that are smartly written, arranged dynamically and with a talented band that know how to play. I take issue with the &quot;offical&quot; review's remarks making good playing and high levels of musicianship sound like slumming. These guys are great players that play music at the level of the song. When they ocassionally stretch out they do so with great taste, something lacking in most areas of music in general and almost missing in modern rock where it almost seems it's a bad thing to be a good musician. Read what musicians who make music think, they don't solo because it's unfashionable. There are as many acts that consider NOT being able to play a virtue (and in some cases it is) as there are mile a minute players that do everything but improve upon the song. <br />You won't find blazing solos but there are some tastefully appropriate ones. You'll also hear some incredible sounds from all the players. <br />in absentia is the album of the year and most likely the first Porcupine Tree album that has significant chance of breaking through with the MTV and college radio market.<br />No matter what I write, it's worth taking a gamble even if unconvinced. The CD is selling at midline price and might possibly be a classic. That is not something I say frequently if ever in any other review I've done.
B00003CX9E|5.0|It's a great movie. If you don't understand it now try to watch later, even than some years later, with a bit more mature mind. But don't resell. The problem is that someones listen that is the best movie of all times and imagine a guaranty entertainment, like the hollywoodan industry of today, sometimes foolish. <BR>   You must to know how to appreciate this kind of movie. This is valid to other great classics too. It requires to think and consider all movie pieces. So if you don't understant, or think that's boring, you must give a second or even a later third chance to this movie.<BR>   I had a little disapointing experience when I saw this movie for the first time. I just guess what ROSEBUD means before the movie's end. There was a episode of a cartoon in the 80's that use a piece of idea of Citizen Kane in the history. It was about a ghost of a millionaire that always shout Roooussebuuuddd around the old mansion, large like a castle. In the end of the episode this ghost is seen happily enjoying his skiing board in the snow, saying Rosubud, that he was trying to find. When I was watchnig Citizen Kane I remambered this cartoon and think: THAT'S IT. So the movie's revelation wasn't a surpriese to me, unfortunately. Despite of all movie's magnificence I was \\"damaged\\" by a cartoon. Funny, isn't it?<BR>  Well, but even so the movie was great and still is each time tham I watch. So, If you don't like it so much, try to give a chance, and maybe you come to discover what really is cinema.<br />
B000001Y79|5.0|My favorite No Doubt album, and one of my favorite albums of all time, which speaks well for this album because I had always considered No Doubt just another pop band with no real talent. I gave this a listen because I'm a fan of Sublime, and had some people on the Internet tell me to give it a chance. I'm glad I did. Aside from the songs you'll hear on the radio (&quot;Just A Girl&quot;, &quot;Spiderweb&quot;, &quot;Don't Speak&quot;) this album includes many gems such as &quot;Different People&quot;, &quot;Sixteen&quot;, &quot;Sunday Morning&quot; and &quot;The Climb.&quot; This is the definitive No Doubt album, and if anyone is looking into buying anything from them this is it. Whereas &quot;Return of Saturn&quot; is especially mature and beyond some listeners ability to relate and &quot;Rock Steady&quot; is especially immature and practically an insult to the band's talent, this one is just where it should be. Somewhat playful and easy to listen to, but also expresive and interesting. Plus there's a great ska feel to this album that is somewhat lost in the others. This one is a must have.
6305807930|3.0|First of all the dvd quality is mediocre. The picture quality is barely vhs standards and the sound is dull and very flat. Now about the movie: The murdering scenes are good and the end is gripping enough especially the transformation into death. I love the soundtrack. What I do not like too much is the persistent tone of blue, red and green in every image of the movie, it make it look somewhat cheesy. Overall: DECENT.
B00000JPHD|3.0|... Words spoken by the late, great Bela Lugosi, as the evil master of the undead, during his initial meeting with the doomed Renfield (Dwight Frye) in Universal Pictures' classic 1931 screen version of Bram Stoker's famous novel, \\"Dracula\\".<br />The film opens eerily with the main title credits super-imposed over the figure of a bat set to the haunting music of Tchaikovsky's \\"Swan Lake\\".<br />As the action begins, we find the character of Renfield arriving at a small inn, nestled in the midst of the majestic Transylvanian Alps, aboard a horse-drawn carriage that has stopped in order to let its passengers off before the setting of the sun.  When Renfield announces that he has no intention of remaining at the inn overnight, but instead plans to travel onward to Castle Dracula in order to finalize a business arrangement with the Count, the villagers beg and plead with him to do otherwise explaining to Renfield that Dracula is no mortal man, but is instead a vampire!  Foolishly Renfield refuses to heed the villagers' warnings, regarding them as being nothing more than superstition, and manages to convince the now terrified coachman that it is a matter of great importance that he arrive at the castle that night.  Before departing, however, Renfield is halted by the inn keeper's wife who places a necklace with the symbol of a cross fastened to it around his neck, uttering the words, \\"For your Mother's sake\\".<br />Later, after the sun has set and the moon has risen, full and bright in the ominous night sky amidst the \\"music\\" of howling wolves, Renfield finds himself at the footsteps to the entrance of the foreboding castle, being greeted by none other than Count Dracula himself.  After sitting down for food and drink, Renfield and Dracula finalize an arrangement for the Count to leave his castle in Translyvania and move to a new home awaiting him in London.  With all business having now been attended to, the seemingly hospitable Count leads the tired Renfield to a guest bedroom and bids him good night.  However, unbeknownst to poor Renfield, it will be his last time to fall asleep as a mortal being, for later that night, a large bat flies through an open window in his room only to reveal itself as the immortal Count, ready to quench his undying thirst for human blood.<br />Several days later, a ship arrives in an English harbor, greeted by citizens horrified by the ghastly site they find onboard the vessel, the dead bodies of the ship's captain and crew drained of all blood, and a now insane Renfield laughing madly down below deck.<br />Little does the city of London realize, though, that the nightmare has only just begun, for now a danger it has never known before stalks its fog-shrowded streets at night, a danger in the form of the undead ... THE VAMPIRE DRACULA!<br />Also starring Edward Van Sloan as the evil Count's nemesis, Dr. Van Helsing, \\"Dracula\\" is a horror film classic like no other, taut with tension, mystery and suspense!
B00003CXAY|5.0|The arrival of these films in DVD format after a long and painful journey thru legal limbo is a joy to behold.  Koyaanisqatsi is truly one of the most visually stunning films of all time, but that isn't it, no far from it.  In addition to Reggio and Fricke's breathtaking visuals, one is further blessed with the genius of Philip Glass' score. The sections of the film can be hypnotic, jarring, humorous, heartbreaking, puzzling, or strange, and what one takes from the film isn't set in stone, but its guaranteed to challenge the viewer in the best sense of the term.<br />Its Sequel, Powaqqatsi is no less ambitious and no less  phenomenal, shifting to the \\"third world\\" and slowing down the visual pace of much of the film (literally).  It also features what is perhaps Philip Glass' most powerful music ever (matched in ambition and scope only by his Opera Akhnaten).<br />Words must enevitably fall short to fully describe these films though, for if a picture is worth a thousand words, these films provide thousands of pictures for us to contemplate. A Definite \\"must own\\"!!
0316776963|4.0|Funny stuff from Sedaris, a guy who's qualified to write funny stories because he's lived them, one way or another.  I have no doubt that Sedaris stretches the truth in many of his anecdotes, but that's a sign of a good storyteller (after all, anyone could be passive witness to a great many funny incidents, but that doesn't mean we'll necessarily laugh with just anybody).  When you have this much amusing material, it's no coincidence - it's skill.<br />What I loved best was Sedaris's ability to tell ordinary yet quirky stories involving everyday yet hilarious people.  He does this without talking down, settling for empty sarcasm, or self-pity.  Here is an observant narrator both full of wit and imagination and free of cumbersome pretension.  From his blunt mom and deluded dad, to his innocently cruel but deliciously virulent sister, the supporting players (the subjects, even) are likeable and familiar.
B000002H97|5.0|Okay, so many thrash-metal fans bash this album simply because it wasn't what they expected. Call these guys sellouts, inspired or whatever you want to. The bottom line is if you listen to this album without thinking, &quot;man, the only good music is extremely hard&quot; you'll probably find it's one of the best albums you've ever listened to. These days people think they need to belong to one of two extremes: the mainstream who only like what they're told to like and the underground who only like bands that get no exposure and will turn on them if they do. Why belong to either group? Judge music by what it is. &quot;Enter Sandman&quot; is a hard, but not heavy song that's thrilling to listen to. &quot;The Unforgiven&quot; is slower, but still excellent, and the same goes for &quot;Nothing Else Matters.&quot; Other highlights include &quot;Sad But True&quot; and &quot;Whever I May Roam.&quot; The only real low point is &quot;Don't Tread On Me&quot; which just doesn't seem to belong on this album. I've also heard complaints from former fans that the songs on this album aren't as long as the ones on previous albums. In my opinion, that's a plus. No matter how great a song is, if it goes too long it becomes boring. Short and sweet is how it should be. But you can't take my word for it or those of other listeners. As I've pointed out all throughout this review, this album is what it is. Take it or leave it.
0679411585|5.0|I must say that I saw this movie before I read the book.  I was concerned that the first 20 - 30% of the book would be similar to the movie with a review of the soldiers family lives, life on the base, the creation of the unit, and the training.  Not that this information is not interesting, but this book was held out as one of the better books on Vietnam combat, not base life descriptions.  I turned out to be pleased with the book in that it started out with action and never stopped.  I have read a number of books about combat and this one was one of the best I have read - ranking up there with Back Hawk Down.   From page 1 to the end there are no slow spots in the book, it is full speed the whole way.  <br />The book tells the story of two different, but related battles that took place in 1965.  They were the first major battles of the American effort in the war and they were some of the hardest fought.  The author interviewed what seams like almost everybody that made it out for the book, and he lets the soldiers use their own words so that you get a full picture of each section of the battle.   It is interesting to see how two or three different people in different locations viewed / remembered the same situations.   The one draw back to this form of story telling is that there is not a consistent author's style.  This is a minor point because Harold Moore did a wonderful job in telling the story and placing the other solders statements in the text.  Overall it is a great book that anyone interested in combat or the Vietnam War will need to read.
B000065AQU|5.0|great cd, perfect songs great riffs and gutair speed that rivals even the great Kerry King of Slayer, if you like bands that follow there own style then you must check these guys out. Also by there first cd &quot;System Of A Down&quot;. If you like those cds check out Reign In Blood by Slayer. They too have followed thereown style for close to 20 years and im sure you would love them if you like these guys
0671027344|5.0|The Perks of Being a Wallflower is one of the best and most memorible books that I have read in a long time.  The book travels through the life of Charley, a high school student, who encounters just about everything that could happen to a confuesd high schooler.  I definetly recomend this book if anyone wants to a quick read that will keep them intresetd for the whole day it takes to read it, i recomend The Perks of Being a Wallflower.
B000002UJQ|1.0|Some call Radiohead's music inaccessible. I call it intolerable. Just as people learn to live under Third World regimes, people learn to endure Radiohead. Note: endure, NOT like. Those who claim to like Radiohead are only kidding themselves. It's quite admirable, really: they've learnt to tolerate the intolerable.<br />Radiohead have gained such an enormous fan-base amongst college students precisely for this reason. Nobody else can understand their music - it's dischordant, it's headache-inducing, it's lyrics are patently meaningless. Thus, it's exclusive, it's cliquey! It's not about the music, it's about the identity they derive from listening to the music.<br />Music-lovers beware! Don't fall into the same trap! Stick well clear of this piece of glorified garbage. Any praise it has received is simply self-aggrandizement.
0060931671|4.0|~ - ~ - ~<BR> I'm pretending you know nothing about this book or the author for the sake of this review.<BR>~ - ~ - ~<BR>.....Firstly, Thomas Pyncheon is clearly a genius, and is a very powerful writer. <BR>Too bad it is almost always nearly impossible to figure out what the heck he is saying, or even worse, what the characters in his novels are doing. <BR>(And what continent are they on now?). <BR>He can make a metaphor that sends shivers down my spine about the \\"dt\\" in an equation describing a rocket's trajectory. (But I still don't know what the heck happened to Katjie!)- These complaints refer to \\"Gravity's Rainbow\\" and \\"V\\".<BR>~ - ~ - ~<BR>.....Luckily for us, \\"The Crying of Lot 49\\" is the exception, and a great book. <BR>The surface story is clear, and relatively easy to follow. Oedipa Maas finds herself appointed executrix of the estate of a wealthy former lover, in Southern California. <BR>After a series of bizarre coincidences, and meetings with what must be some of the most eccentric characters on earth, she begins to discern a series of \\"clues\\". These signs may be pointing to the existence of a vast conspiracy sweeping the city, state, and or Nation. <BR>Alternatively, they may be the manifestations of her own mental breakdown into paranoia. Or possibly an elaborate joke left behind by the deceased.<BR>~ - ~ - ~<BR>...... The beauty of this book is in how we are drawn into the web along with Oedipa, seeing the connections, pondering their meaning.... until we are certainly feeling as paranoid as she.<BR>I found this book very readable and entertaining, unlike other Pyncheon novels like \\"Gravity's Rainbow\\" which is exhausting to try to read. <BR>~ - ~ - ~<BR>..... If you've heard of Pyncheon, or just want a sample of a great 20th century writer, this is definitely the book I'd recommend. It is entertaining and satisfying, as well as thought provoking. <BR>You could listen to educated readers debate the merits of different works by Pyncheon. I suggest you not waste your time. Instead, take a look at this book.
076790382X|5.0|Bryson is so observant and clever, you won't want to stop reading. But since the book is made up of small independent essays, you can read a little at a time. British and American people will both find insight and amusement about themselves and the &quot;other side.&quot;
B00006J3WH|5.0|It took almost a year, but finally we get to listen to this awesome musical episode on CD instead of wearing out our VCR tapes. Joss Whedon did an amazing job of mixing song styles into one cohesive entity. Highlights include Amber Benson's beautiful &quot;Under Your Spell&quot; and &quot;Walk Through the Fire.&quot; Loved hearing the rest of the Parking Ticket song too.
B0000640VO|5.0|&quot;Amelie&quot; is a wondrous and whimsical movie about a shy, beautiful young woman named Amelie who emerges from her sheltered, dream-like existence into the real world.  <br />One fateful night, Amelie discovers a little keepsake box in her apartment.  This inspires her to find the owner of the box. She does find the owner.  She is so overjoyed by the owner's gratitude that she ventures out to do more good deeds for more people.  In the process, she changes peoples' lives for the better.  She also learns to trust people.  Amelie becomes a participant in life instead of only an observer as she had been.   And she eventually overcomes her fear of relationships and finds a soulmate.<br />Visually, &quot;Amelie&quot; is a marvel in filmmaking with stunning cinematography and surprising, even startling special effects that are seemlessly blended into the comedy, romance, and fantasy of the story. The quirky narration and dialogue are filled with witty and worldy observations about life in Paris and about life in general. <br />&quot;Amelie&quot; is imaginatively brought to life by the director Jean-Pierre Jeunet and by its radiant star, Audrey Tautou.  Hers is a starmaking performance.  Tautou endearingly and precisely captures the hesitant charm, fragility, ingenuity, and ultimate determination of our heroine Amelie with exceptional subtlety and grace that should have earned her at least an Academy award nomination. The movie itself deserved to win Best Foreign Picture but didn't.  Go figure.<br />By all means, buy this DVD.  You'll be enchanted and grateful for the experience of &quot;Amelie&quot;.
B00006J9OT|5.0|After spending the past few weeks listening to her other releases I own, it's apparent to me that Diana Krall's &quot;Live in Paris&quot; highlights several qualities which aren't as noticeable on the other albums. For one, her voice is fuller, huskier, and shows a greater dynamic range here than on many of her studio-recorded tracks. In addition, the more open arrangements which come with a live gig allow her jazz piano skills to shine in ways not often heard on the albums. Finally, the rhythmic variations she displays with her voice and fingers throughout the performance aren't utilized much on her earlier albums.<br />After listening through the album several times, my personal faves are &quot;The Look of Love,&quot; &quot;Maybe You'll Be There,&quot; and &quot;A Case of You.&quot; I don't care much for the version of &quot;Just the Way You Are&quot; included here. Though it's included as a bonus track, its polished smooth-jazz/pop sound doesn't fit well with the jazzy, more open and engaging tracks which precede it. <br />All in all, if you've seen Ms. Krall live (I saw her in D.C. in April) I heartily recommend this CD - it'll bring back what makes evenings with her so memorable. And if you haven't seen her live, this CD will make you want to.
B00000JCOV|1.0|This Aint music, this is just s#~t, infact its a pile of s#~t, why waste ya money on some masked nuggets screaming down the mic.<BR>go out and get some 2pac or bone thugs n harmony albums, thats real music
0930289234|3.0|I was told by a few people that this was the book to read to change my mind about comics (I am not a fan). While I can definately say that the book is very well done, I have not had an epiphany by any means. The story is solid and quite interesting. Alan Moore is clearly incredibly gifted as a comic book writer. But this just doesn't measure up to the better novel writers around today. If you are into comics, I can't see how you couldn't love this book. If you're not, give it a shot. It didn't change my mind, but it got closer than anything else I've read.
B00005OAIE|4.0|Considering how much I love this album, I was compelled to write a review after rreading amzaon's unfair review.<br />What makes this album good is the provoking guitar and overall jazzy feel of the album. <br />Yes, the lyrics are mostly just John Mayer musing about different aspects of his life, but does that mean we should get animous towards him? Not at all. <br />A very good album to have with you on a long drive or just for some good easy listening.
B00006J3T4|5.0|Finally! A rock star who understands his strengths and knows how to use them to optimal effect! This is a brilliant, exquisite dispaly of song craft, subtle and sophisticated guitar playing, sublimely wrought melodies and arrangements that will stand as a hallmark of one of the truly great writers to have emerged at the end of the seventies. 25 years on and Mark Knopfler is more in command of his considerable powers than ever before. Perhaps through his soundtracks, stint with the Notting Hill Billies, his &quot;Sailing to Philadelphia&quot; Mark has shed his money for nothing vapour lock and emerged, or better reemerged as the eminent storyteller who so finally crafted epics like &quot;Telegraph Road&quot; and &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot; and of course &quot;Sultans.&quot;<br />The genuine article, as one might say, he is Geordie through and through, and his borderlands colours wave bravely over this album of finely written stories. From the opening &quot;Way Aye Man&quot;, all full of Tyneside atmosphere and courage to the closing &quot;Old Pigweed&quot; the narrators are real people with very effecting tales to tell. Knopfler and James McMurtry share that unique ability to gain the insight of people who live close to their circumstances, like most of us do, and dissect the issues that are the crest jewel of the decisions we make in life.<br />The band on this disc is just incredible. Chad Cromwell's drumming is the absolutely perfect foil for Knopfler's guitar lines, and fellow Notting Hillman, Guy Fletcher is on board to keep things organically true to the bone. The bass lines are as dynamic as the guitar runs and when you listen to &quot;Coyote&quot;, complete with horns, it strikes you how well intelligence can swing. In some phrases, Knopfler brings to mind fellow Geordie Martin Stephenson, and perhaps it's in the Newcastle blood, the ability to swing. Certainly the pipe tunes from the tradition there roll with a sea spray you don't hear in other traditions,so it must carry over to more contemporary writers as well.<br />The waltz, &quot;Ragpicker's Dream&quot; is achingly beautiful, full of all the sentinmentality and bittersweetness of the waltzes he wrote for &quot;Local Hero&quot;. Each and every song on this collection is a gem. As my headline states, this is a subtle, sophisticated masterpiece: it swings, it waltzes, it rocks and it stands on its own merits as a statement from a consummate musiciian and insightful writer of the daily vicissitudes of life that propel us as we embrace our past, present and future. Well done, Knop. Best of the Year!
B00006AG5N|5.0|Elvis 30 #1 is the best I have heard and the extra cd &quot;ALITTLE LESS CONVERSATION&quot; just add's to it. This is why ELVIS is still the king. It deserve's to be #i all over the world.I would deffintly recommend it to everyone.
B00006ADD5|5.0|Lawrence Of Arabia is one of the biggest and grandest films ever made. Director David Lean crafted a stunning epic that tells the tale of World War I British soldier T.E. Lawrence. Lawrence joined the various desert tribes of Arabia against the Turks and the desert battle scenes are breathtaking. Peter O'Toole is amazing as Lawrence in what would be a star-making turn for him. Omar Shariff, Anthony Quinn and Alec Guinness provide strong support, but this is Mr. Lean's film through and through. His direction provides sweeping shots of the desert vistas and gives the film its big look, but he also allows the story to flow and we really get inside the complicated head of Lawrence and see his psychological foibles. The film is beautifully transferred to DVD and it brings justice to the film that had previously suffered on video transfers. The movie was a major success as it swept through the 1962 Oscars winning Best Picture and Best Director, but Mr. O'Toole lost out on what would be the first of his of his seven unsuccessful Best Actor nominations.
0679459529|2.0|An astronaut is frozen in space, picked up after five hundred, oops, make that one thousand years, and is introduced to the wonders of the future.  Honestly, I'm stunned that Clarke had the gall to steal such an idea.  All that was missing was Wilma Derring and the Draconians.<br />Unfortunately, unlike Buck's tales of derring-do, Frank Poole's wander through the 31st century is extremely laid-back, and, strangely enough, filled with lectures and sermonettes against the alleged evils of religion (delivered, ironically enough, with an almost religious fervor).  Clarke's humanist tendencies were clear enough in 2001 and 2010, but at least he had the sense not to completely and deliberately alienate a portion of his audience in those tomes.  <br />On a more positive note, I found John Glover to be an extremely competent interpreter of the written word.  If you enjoy the art of reader's theater, the audio version of the book is worth a listen--just don't pay too much for it.  <br />To take a final shot, I must point out that the story didn't really begin until the last half of the third cassette (of 4).  By that time I was almost wishing the Draconians would invade...
B00006DEF9|5.0|...that hasn't already been said about &quot;Singin' in the Rain&quot;? It's marvelously entertaining, wonderfully witty and refreshingly literate. Suffice to say, it's a must-see, even for those who are avowed musical-comedy-haters. And in the newly restored version, the sound and visuals REALLY pop.<br />Note to reviewer Jan: they didn't release a letterboxed edition, because it wasn't filmed in widescreen! &quot;Singin' in the Rain&quot; was made over a year before Twentieth Century Fox introduced the CinemaScope process and ushered in the widescreen era.
B00006DEFA|5.0|Milos Forman's Amadeus is a hugely entertaining adaptation of Peter Shaffer's play. The movie is told in flashback style from the memory of Antonio Salieri. Salieri was a successful and popular composer who was a rival of Mozart's. History has speculated on the death of Mozart and some people are of the opinion that Salieri had a hand in his death (possibly even murdered him). The film explores this angle of the legend. Salieri is consumed by his jealousy and hatred of the infantile Mozart. Mozart is a musical genius, but a wild spending and is always looking for the next good time. His operas are utterly brilliant, but are unsuccessful. He is in constant debt. Salieri concocts a plan for Mozart to compose a requiem. This work is actually planned as Mozart's own requiem. Mozart is shown as slowly going mad and at the end of the film, Salieri helps him by writing the musical score down for a very weak Mozart. The morning after Mozart and Salieri work together, Mozart is found dead and we are left speculating whether he died through natural causes or if Salieri did something to him. F. Murray Abrham is absolutely amazing as Salieri. He brings across the jealousy and hatred, but doesn't make Salieri a fiend. He has major respect for Mozart's musical talents, but doesn't understand why God would give them to such an obvious heathen. Tom Hulce is equally as good as Mozart. He plays him with a reckless abandon and in an over the top fashion that is perfectly suited for the role. The film took home the 1984 Best Picture Oscar, Mr. Forman won Best Director and Mr. Abrham beat out Mr. Hulce for Best Actor. This was a case where a tie would have been more than appropriate. The new director's cut adds 20 minutes of footage, but the real standout is the remastered sound.  The Dolby 5.1 version brings alive the sounds of Mozart in brilliant detail.
B000050XEI|5.0|Absolutely the most beautiful music I have EVER heard! Enya's music has the power to soothe your nerves so that you feel you have no problems, to the lively pieces that give you manic energy. Tracks 1 thru 3  reflect the total originality of this music goddess. Track 4 \\"Tempus Vernum\\" is a little spooky, strongly reminds you of \\"The Omen.\\" Track 8 \\"Silver Inches\\" too dreamy for words. The tracks I loved most are #10 \\"One by One\\" (read the wonderful words to this song, you'll cry)and \\"Lazy Days.\\" The pieces on this Enya CD are like a narcotic. You HAVE to keep listening to it.<BR>  My definition of genius is 1. Originality (something incredibly outstanding that you've never seen/heard before),2.Extremely High Quality (Enya never turns out junk or cliche'),3. Quantity (she's got a long future ahead of writing music. Lucky for us.) If the naysayers of this CD didn't like it, I strongly suspect they didn't listen to ALL of it. I'm glad I agreed with the lovers of this CD and bought it. Can't wait for more music from this great artist!
B000068OCS|1.0|I've seen the \\"explanations\\" put forth by the spokespeople.  They don't make sense.  If you saw the film as originally presented, or, like me, you happened to own an old home video version of this film, you'd be outraged.  The MGM/UA version of this film is hacked.  The \\"letterboxing\\" is artificial.  I could create quite a list of wonderful things you AREN'T SEEING in this DVD version because of the artificial black bars covering the top and bottom of the screen.  This can't be right.  I loved this film.  The new MGM/UA DVD is just wrong.  The single star is for this DVD version.  I wish I could give the five stars this film deserves, but I can't.  I can't watch the DVD because it ticks me off.  I'll just fire up my ol' Laserdisc and see the WHOLE film.  ...And wait for a full-screen version of the DVD to come out so I'd have to buy Koyaanisqatsi AGAIN.
B00005V9HH|4.0|Many twists in this clever suspense thriller as told by one of the usual suspects from a recent police line up. The 5 suspects are brought in on a trumped up stolen van charge and the story unfolds from there. Great acting and wonderful casting including the very talented Kevin Spacey, who alone makes this movie worth checking out. The story telling is in the vein of a Quinten Tarentino movie, but only slightly more conventional. If you like trying to figure out what is really going on and who done it, you will enjoy this one.
B000069AUI|1.0|Let me preface this by saying that I am an avid music fan, with tastes in all different genres and styles and can appreciate talent and art when i hear it. I own Parachutes and while I found some songs enjoyable and engaging, it was not and is not the masterpiece everyone says it is. It was catchy, sure, but nothing amazing. Yet I was interested in seeing what else this band could offer. I saw potential for a great progression. Unfortunately, &quot;A Rush Of Blood To The Head&quot; is an OVERPRODUCED, EMOTIONLESS mess. It tries way too hard to impress and to please. The songs are lifeless. They lack character and emotion. For those tagging this album as &quot;passionate&quot; and &quot;emotional,&quot; do yourself a favor and buy &quot;Sea Change&quot; by Beck for a truly emotional new album.<BR>One star and that's only for In My Place which is probably because it is so similar to Trouble.
B00002ZMNV|5.0|This DVD is amazing.  Even for the price it can't be beat, it features 2 sets with the SSO (san fran. symphony orchestra) and you can select different music channels ie. Band alone, Together, Symphony etc.  The sound quality is nothing short of amazing, and the video angles for some songs are a great feature.  When seeing the choice between the double CD for five bucks less than the DVD, and the fact that the DVD has full concert footage made this a very VERY sound choice.
B00003CXXJ|2.0|This movie was built up to be something it really is not and that is a kids movie. With all the bodily function jokes and sexual overtones I am surprised it got the rating it did and that people let their small children watch it. If it was billed differently, I might given it another star. It has a few good moments as a fairy tale about love and not judging the book by its cover. It has a refreshing ending but it most certainly does not live up to the hype.
B00005B36H|5.0|The New Millenium is here...and so still are we.  We live in an increasingly unnerving digtally formatted, instantly gratified world...we NEED music like this...tough, strong, and cynical. <BR>  You see, most reviews are not hitting the point. The music of Tool is all about Edge.  It's about crossing  boundaries...pushing personal limits.  I recommend the following:  Listen to Lateralus (esp. #7 &quot;Parabola&quot;,#11 &quot;Reflection&quot;, and #9 title track).....listen to &quot;classic&quot; Undertow (#'s 1, 2 and 9 spring to mind)....participate in a sport where your life sometimes hangs in the balance...surf waves bigger than you are....snowboard the deepest powder in raging storms..drop a cliff or two. Fly an acrobatic plane to it's limits...you'll get it.  Tools music can help as a catalyst to some incredible feelings/moments.  It's about tapping into the human psyche...<BR>  Oh, and anyone who likes Tool should aquaint themselves with the earlier written SF works of William Gibson..the inventer of &quot;cyberpunk&quot;. Read especially &quot;Burning Chrome&quot;, his collection of short stories.<BR>   I also recommend listening to Joe Satrianis last two works, &quot;Engines of Creation&quot;, and &quot;Strange Beautiful Music&quot;, and Tool fans may appreciate Mickey Harts (yes, of the defunct Grateful Dead) &quot;Planet Drum&quot; cd: interesting to see where our present day drum sound/rythyms have come from.<BR>   The future is tough and real and here...sorry....Backstreet Boys just don't cut it.  Go big or go home.
B000002UVZ|5.0|I'll never forget the day in 1987 when I was riding around in my friend's Mustang.  He asked if I'd ever heard of a band called REM.  &quot;No&quot; says I.  He put this tape in, and from the first moment, I was a fan.  I now own all of REM's major releases, but this is still my favorite.  There is never a weak moment on this album, which makes it hard to identify the the real standouts.  But if pressed, I still absolutely swoon everytime I hear &quot;Fall on Me&quot;, &quot;Superman&quot; and &quot;Begin the Begin&quot;.  <BR>If you have any interest in REM whatsoever, you owe it to yourself to pick up this disc.
B000003S09|5.0|To all of you who own the EG remastered 1989 \\"Definitive Edition\\" I can only say -- save the jewel case and the artwork but the disc makes a nice coaster -- so buy this 30th anniversary edition --NOW!  And to those who own the vinyl in its various forms -- save the gatefold sleeve to read the lyrics as our eyesight continues to fade. It still makes a great surface for rolling illicit substances!  Seriously, one listen to 21st Century Schizoid Man (not my favorite track by a long shot) should convince you that this time Fripp means business!  This makes the \\"definitive\\" CD sound like sludge!  I was amazed by the difference.  Prog rock may not be everyone's cup of chai but this is the pinnacle -- the touchstone.  Throw out all that Yes and Genesis and ELP and Kansas (except the first album) junk and viddy this, my droogs.  If we can put this CD in the hands of high-end audio system salesmen we will never again have to endure a test listen of Flim and the BB's over some mega-watt audio rig.  Of course there is always the risk of a blown sale with King Crimson on the demo since THIS IS TRULY SCARY STUFF!  Michael Giles' drums are truly awesome and Ian McDonald's keyboard fills are actually audible on this edition. In case you don't have the point yet -- this is truly a revelation.  Now if you'll excuse me I'm off to order the 30th anniversary editions of In the Wake of Poseidon and Lizard.  Frankly, nothing by KC after that time interests me -- in terms of prog rock, this is all you need.
B00006AG5N|1.0|Just another compilation, this one clearly designed to cash in on all the media hype over the 25th anniversary of Elvis' death.  Avoid, avoid, AVOID!
B0000024RQ|5.0|This is the heart of folk songs, good stuff, some of his best work.
B00005QZ7U|2.0|whacked out and hard to follow. In other words your wife/girlfriend will love it. Watch it while your tripping and it might be good, but sober its insanely boring.
B000006NUW|5.0|I can't put this strongly enough.  Disregard the warnings about the sound on this set.  These are original mono single mixes.  They have warmth, clarity, and punch.  The sound is natural and deeply engaging.  Best of all, they haven't been tampered with for the sake of more recent tastes.  What you get here are clear, lively, digital versions that faithfully approximate the way these singles were originally meant to sound.  This set is prized by many audiophiles and with good reason.
B00000DGUG|5.0|Alanis is for every mood: JLP; when you feel a need for honesty,  when you're frustrated with life. MTVU; when you're not really sure what you're feelin, when you want to sing along and forget bout stuff. URS; when it's time to make a new start, feel good about yourself. SFIJ is no doubt the queen of reflectedness. it's been getting me through this year! the realisation in That I would Be Good and Joining You that you can't be judged on what society sees and you have an inward value is a priceless thought. Front Row, The Couch, and I was Hoping show some typical Alanis conversations and give insight into her relationships. Being biased as a mental Alanis fan, i have to say every song is pure genius! don't miss out! get a copy ASAP!!!
B00006J9OT|4.0|I have been waiting, not too patiently for over a year for Diane's next album.  The last one, The Look of Love was somewhat disappointing for a fan like me who loves to hear Ms. Krall wail on her sohpisticated jazz piano...This one really Swings!  Starting with the first track, a hip Peggy Lee number; I Love Being Here with You,( with a mystery reference to Ray Brown).  As I listened to the beautifully engineered live <BR>recording, my mind flashed back to some of my all time favorite &quot;Live&quot; recordings such as Brubeck's Jazz Goes to College, Errol Concert's Concert in Carmel, and Ahmad Jamal Live at the Pershing.  This album will be right up there with those classics....Why?  The energy, the enthusiasm Krall and the boys bring to this CD, the obvious warmth of the audience....but MOST of all hearing Diane SWING again.  Her piano playing is a joy to hear.  The excellent back up work with some creative guitar work by Anthony Wilson, great bass work including a solo with the bow by John Clayton, and the missing drums from All for You...Really rounds out the sound for Ms. Krall.  She is a great blend of new/old sounds with a marvelous appreciation for her precedessors.  This album might also be billed as a tribute to the George Shearing Quintet.  She uses a big, FAT, great Shearing sound to great effect and even includes vibes but I found no credit for the vibe player.<br />All in all a great album...Why only 4.5 stars?  I would have liked a few more new songs!  Here's hoping Diane is hard at work on her next album...with plenty of great new solos like the best I have heard her do on Deed I Do.  I recommend you get 2 copies...one for home and one for the car...You won't want to be anywhere without easy access to Live in Paris
B00003CXAE|4.0|I won't go into the plot here, because, let's face it, if you haven't seen Grease by now, you probably won't ever see it.  And you are missing out on a really fun film.  That is the secret to this movie's popularity.  It's just plain fun!  It doesn't have a really great script, none of the performancies (with the exception of Stockard Channing) is anything above run-of-the-mill, but it's got a lot of great, catchy songs, a very likeable cast, and is just a treat to watch again and again.  I was disappointed by this DVD release though, because it's exactly the same as the laser disc, only smaller and you don't have to turn it over.  The cast interviews at the end are four years old, and this is really just a delayed release of the 20th Anniversary Edition on DVD.  And what fan of Grease needs a cheap, paper booklet of song lyrics?  Believe me, we know them all by heart.  Truly the most profitable and one of the most popular musicals ever made deserves a better DVD package.  The fans certainly deserve it too, having waited so long for this.  Boo! to Paramount for, apparently, wanting to wait and pick our pockets again some time down the road when they release the two-disc set with all the extras this movie should have.  At least it's in widescreen, which is a totally different viewing experience for anyone who hasn't seen it letterboxed or on the big screen yet.  The musical numbers have a much larger scope, with dancers and other action on the sides that had previously been cut off.  You will be surprised how many previously unseen guys are on the bleachers with Danny and the gang for \\"Summer Nights\\".  And to anyone who is planning to buy the full-frame DVD--shame on you!  You are truly missing out.
B00006J3WH|3.0|And they are Anthony Stewart Head (Giles) and Amber Benson (Tara).  When ever they sing the album sounds realy good.  However the other cast members don't fair as well.  Nicholas Brendon (Xander) and Alyson Hannigan (Willow) are probably the worst singers on the album.  Thankfully Willow does not get any real solos, and Xander has one very Broadway-like duet with Emma Caufield (Anya).  That song doesn't really require much range, and relies more on the quick pace and quick witted lyrics.  James Marsters (Spike) has his one solo that isn't bad, but also isn't very good either.  Finally there is Sarah Michelle Gellar (Buffy), she is the one who the album hinges on.  I mean, after all, she is the star of the show.  You can tell that she took some lessons, and she doesn't sound too awful.  Unfortunately she doesn't sound too great either.  She is a passable singer.  Her real talent lies in her physical performances.  On the show she is always at her best when stuff is physical.  I don't mean the fighting, although that is very good, I mean when she shows her emotions, and doesn't tell us about it.  Ms. Gellar has great facial reactions.  Her smile is wonderful, but so is her sad face (lips trembling, eyes watering, ect.).  I have always felt that it is her physical presance that makes the show special.  A great example of this is an episode in the sixth season where Buffy is turned invisable.  All I will say is that her voice acting left a lot to be desired.  But I digress, back to the CD.  Without seeing the physical actions of this episode, the dancing, I feel this CD only contains a few good songs and is for Buffy Fanatics only.  If you want a good musical CD get Guys and Dolls, or the Producers, or better yet Tommy (the Who version not the Broadway version).  My suggestion wait for the DVD, that way you'll be able so see the dancing, and most likely hear a commentary by on the episode by Joss Whedon (the show's creator).
0385505833|4.0|If you need a book to relax with in front of the TV...one which won't scare you or make it tough to sleep then this is a good candidate.  It's very funny and if you are a middle-aged average American, then you'll be able to identify with the problems neighbors can bring. It really is amazing the difficulty skipping Christmas presents and they almost manage it perfectly....almost.
B00005JL78|5.0|I watched Minority Report 3 times in theater, I may watch it even more until the DVD is released. It is first the only good picture since A.I. I disliked every movie I watched this year, only Panic Room was not too bad but Minority Report like A.I. is a greatly shot motion picture. Everything is first class in the film, music by Williams creates a suspenseful and dark future atmosphere and tension like Herrmann did in Hitchcock movies. Kaminski's colours and lights are again extraordinary like in A.I., Kahn's editing is on its top since Saving Private Ryan, but I especially liked the editing on this one since there are some scenes with such a good montage which carry a lot of suspense and power mostly because of their montage. The futuristic setting is well done but not the heart of the film. The story is really strong. Spielberg chose this time a murder story with lots of thinking in it. The only bad thing about the film is that it has some irrelevant small scenes in it. I didn't read the short story of K. Dick but I'm sure Spielberg added some humour and some more action to the film just to make sure that the film makes some box office. The Anderton's Great Escape scene in the metro escape was too much irrelevant for the story, it had nice FX in it and it was a well shot action scene but it's not going well with the mood of the movie. Spoilers ahead, not read below if you didn't see the movie yet.<BR>    I really think the best part of the film begins when Anderton and Agantha leave Rufus Riley's Cyberhouse and continues until Anderton kills Leo Crow and drops the gun. That 15 minute interval is a perfect example of filmmaking and all that time I never blinked. Every single frame in those 15 minutes is amazingly well shot and edited. After that when we hear the story of Sean by Agatha, that scene is also extraordinary. And off course the beginning of the movie with the first rescue is great and the screen fades to black with a vision of Agatha in the water. That 15 minutes is also a masterpiece on its own. <BR>    Don't get me wrong, I like every scene in the film but those 3 intervals I mention above have the perfect sequel of scenes with driving tension and no irrelevant mood-breaking action or humour in them. For example the scene when Anderton takes Agatha from the temple is also great work of editing but after the car scene comes a humour scene where Anderton picks some clothing for Agatha and the Japanese name Anderton's eyes carry makes people laugh, but I ask why? What would happen if take the scene out. We don't need critically where and how Anderton buys or steals Agatha something to wear. Those scenes are definitely mood-breakers in the middle of 2 serious scenes and I believe that they were put for the box office there. Also Anderton's escape scene after the metro exit. We really don't need that scene. He finds himself inside of a car being built and then escapes with that car to Hineman. Come on, that scene is ok in a Lost World type comedy action movie, but not in a Sciencefiction-Drama. I like action but in this movie only the main parts I'm more interested in and those are which carry the story. Rufus T. Riley's cyberhouse scene also could be more serious but not filled with humour by Rufus himself. Anyway, in general the movie is good. The best since A.I. but I like A.I. more since it had less moodbreaker scenes than this one. I hope Catch Me If You Can will feature a more serious mood than this one. And long live Spielberg. : )
B00003CXAA|5.0|The best DVD set on the market.  All 3 movies are excellent.  You will not be disappointed, and neither will anyone watching with you.
6303269842|4.0|This is a great film. retaining the character of the original television series, perhaps James Garner's second best known role after Jim Rockford. My concern that Garner had been replaced by Mel Gibson and been relegated to a mere cameo was misplaced, as by the end of the film I realised that his role was just as important. The television series from the 1950s to 1980s showed us Bret, Brent, Beau and a number of other Mavericks, but it is Garner's original which really works best. Garner has a knack of portraying a loveable rogue and even here, in his late sixties he still possesses a handsome charm.<br />But my praise of Garner doesn't mean Gibson wasn't up to the job. He is well cast, bringing a macho charm to the role and appealing to the ladies in exactly the same way as Garner. There are some good satirical scenes with the American Indians and some nice set pieces on the paddle steamer (the costumes are beautiful). Jodie Foster too acquits herself well and for one manages to rid herself of that annoying accent.<br />The story centres on Maverick's plot to attend a huge poker tournament on a riverboat and get away with all the takings. Along the way he meets challenges from Garner's character and Foster's character and a wonderful James Coburn as the Steamer's unscrupulous captain.<br />This film is funny and made with a great deal of care. one of the great western movies of the 1990s.
B00006IU73|5.0|... <br />Ok now for the review. I do believe that if PT has any chance of Breaking into the American market, it will be with this Cd. This Cd incorporates a lot of what PT is about and includes Nice Melodies, Great Instrumentation, Great Vocals, Guitars, Guitars, & Guitars. Heavy Guitars, Loud Guitars, Clean Guitars, Fuzzed Out Guitars. This is probably the \\"heaviest\\" of any PT recording overall. There's a nice blend of \\"Opeth\\" styled heavy guitar melodies that blend into very melodic passages. Guess that would be from hanging out with the Opeth guys over the last years or so. There's a few songs that challenge fusion rock bands. Check out the beginning of \\"The Creator Has a Mastertape\\". The new drummer Gavin Harrison smokes on this Cd and especially this song.<br />I have a feeling a lot of people will find this CD and think that PT is an overnight sensation. ... <br /> Get this and then find the back catalog and get them all.
B00006J3T4|5.0|I was really pleased with this album. I thought it was very different for Mark Knopfler. \\"Hill Farmer's Blues\\" is haunting and \\"Fare the Well, Northumberland\\" is also excellent, a very raw blues sound. \\"You Don't Know You're Born\\" provides the long guitar solo at the end of the song that you'll be looking for if you are a long time fan. \\"Why Aye Man\\" is a great story and \\"Devil Baby\\" is very pretty. Worth the money.
B000002MUN|5.0|You really can't go wrong with Wildflowers. The songs are all immensely strong, the playing is beautiful, and it has perhaps the most sparkling production of any record I know. I was surprised to see that Rick Rubin (he of LL Cool J, the Beastie Boys and Public Enemy!) is credited as producer. More credit to him.<br />What totally gobsmacked me was that it was released in 1994. It just doesn't feel eight years old.<br />Tom Petty has been around for a long time, and has come a long way from his origins as some sort of Floridan Suzi Quattro. This record came maybe five years after he hit the commercial stratosphere with Learning To Fly and Into The Great Wide Open, and clearly the Petty no longer feels the need to prove anything to anyone. This is a record for Tom Petty.<br />And it's a cracker: it's by turns gentle and pretty (Wildflowers), melodious (It's Good To Be King), an all-out rocker (Honey-bee), and a fine impression of Dylan (Don't Fade On Me). And these are just random highlights. The whole disc is strong, and its execution is flawless. Production is very natural indeed: hi-fi buffs will auto-excite at the tinkling acoustic guitars and warm snares - no hint of digital manipulation (which probably means its drenched in the stuff!); musos will delight in the subtle, simple clean lines of Mike Campbell, surely one of the most underrated guitar players around.<br />Nowadays Petty is an elder statesman of country rock, providing backing for Johnny Cash, and on the strength of this recording, it isn't hard to see why.
B00006J3WH|5.0|I have to say that I have been waiting for this soundtrack since the musical aired.  I taped the musical and loved it!!! It is one of the top episodes from the show...and I loved the songs, without this soundtrack...in order to hear the songs I would have to rewind and fast forward through the taped episode just to hear them...having this makes it a whole lot easier...this musical was great, it definitely had feeling like the title of the show suggests and if you have been watching the show over the years (I got hooked when I was 15...the years fly cuz now I'm 20 and still hooked..hehe), you understand and have a connection to the show and what its all about...I just can't wait to buy all the episodes on dvd...savin up the cash :)
B000021XS0|5.0|You want a good chuckle?  Read over the negative reviews of this album.  The words &quot;pretentious&quot;, &quot;lifeless&quot;, &quot;cold&quot;, &quot;mechanical&quot; and many others are repeated.  There always has to be a rebel, huh?  It seems like the &quot;cool&quot; thing to do is show how intelligent you are by praising Dream Theater.  However, it seems like a new trend has arisen that you're even &quot;cooler&quot; if you bash them(simply for the fact that everyone praises them.  And by golly, we can't have a band that EVERYONE likes now can we?).  Dream Theater are wonderful musicians and aren't afraid to let you know that they are(I sure would if I could do it, and you would too!).  What would make people happy?  If they played punk instead?  Show the world that they're really hardcore and none of that odd-timing hogwash that no one can dance to?  This album is fantastic, I don't see where people get the idea that it's all technique and no heart(you're obviously getting Dream Theater confused with Malmsteen), there's plenty of so called &quot;emotion&quot; on this album if you listen to it, I mean really listen to it, coz this kind of music you have to listen to many times to get through all of the layers.  This isn't some basic hip hop beat that you take at face value, ya know.  It's something you have to sit an absorb like a viewing of Vertigo.  So, you can really read into the nasty reviews that the so called &quot;music students&quot; (as they all proclaim they are, thus making them more qualified to analyze this album than you) spew out, or let your ears do the judging for you
B00000ADG2|5.0|Over the years, I have grown a contemptuous attitude towards the Grammys for the unspeakbaly dumb choices they often make when giving awards.  But they hit the bullseye in 1999 when Lauryn Hill made a near clean sweep for her debut &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill.&quot;  One third of the Fugees, Hill displayed her ample gifts on this modern classic of an album as producer, songwriter, singer, and rapper.  Weaving hip hop, soul, and Marley-inspired vibes, &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot; is excellent from start to finish and never falters.  It's hard to resist the catchy swing of &quot;Doo Wop,&quot; her funkified makeover of the classic &quot;Can't Take My Eyes Off You,&quot; and the chemistry between Hill and D'Angelo on &quot;Nothing Even Matters.&quot;  But Hill, I think, is most convincing when she sings her way through a broken heart, as evidenced on &quot;Ex-Factor,&quot; &quot;I Used to Love Him,&quot; and my personal favorite &quot;When it Hurts So Bad.&quot;  There are some records that pretty much escape consciousness when the music is over.  But not &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill.&quot;  Like a dwelling spirit, it haunts you after each listen until it stays imprinted in memory, the way great records often do.
B00001U0GQ|5.0|I thought this was a great movie. Everything about this movie was so wonderful. The scenery took my breath away. All the actors and actresses brought their characters to life. I've never read the book so I don't know how it pertains to the movie, but I thought the story-line was awesome. <br />It's a movie that can appeal to almost anyone(except for kids!).<BR>People who love a romance or for the people who like an action, it's definintely for you.
B000002MIF|5.0|\\"Hatful of Hollow,\\" released just months following the Smiths' towering debut, is a revered favorite among fans of this influential Manchester group.  And it's easy to see why.  On this disc, we get a handful of rare tracks and early recordings of songs pulled from their debut album.  The production may be a bit raw, but none of the potency is lost on these stellar Morrissey/Marr compositions.  The single \\"How Soon Is Now\\" captured the essence of detachment probably unlike any other song in the post-Joy Division 1980s, and its warped guitar intro by Johnny Marr is unmistakably original.  There's also the playful S&M bite of \\"Handsome Devil,\\" the self-pity of \\"Accept Yourself\\" and \\"Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now,\\" as well as the disc's closer, the excellent \\"Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want.\\"  Singer Morrissey moans through these tracks in his usual trademark monotone, while guitarist Johnny Marr provides crisp and inspired guitar-fueled melodies.  This album holds a very special place in my collection of CDs, and it's simply a vital purchase for anyone looking to start a collection of work from this legendary group.
B000001FKY|5.0|Its 1987 and again Def Leppard are working with Mutt Lange (producer).  This is the last album to feature the great late Steve &quot;steamin&quot; Clark on guitar.  Even though this album was more syth pop than guitar driven like the early material this was still a damn fine album.  I do agree with some that it was overblown in terms of production and it was more polished than pyromania.  all the songs are top notch not a bad track on here my favorites are all of them with the expection of Excitable not too keen on that one for some reason.  recommended to the max.
B000001EL3|3.0|A glossy collaboration with producer Bob Ezrin, Kiss came into the prime of their popularity with &quot;Destroyer.&quot;  A stylishly produced collection of 70's hard rock, the album is often praised by critics and fans alike.  In truth, while the production value is one of the highest of the band's career, about half of the songs on the album are really of special distinction.  The album opener, &quot;Detroit Rock City&quot;, is one of the finest songs written by Paul Stanley featuring a fairly complex arrangement and a &quot;cinematic&quot; intro filled with the sounds of a driver taking the road.  The song's climax includes the sound effects of a massive auto collision before segueing into the less interesting &quot;King of The Nighttime World.&quot;  Another Stanley composition, &quot;God of Thunder&quot; is performed by Gene Simmons and has actually become a Simmons staple in live shows.  The studio track, with it's slow serpentine rythym and the filtered voices of children at play, evokes images of Disney's &quot;Night on Bald Mountain.&quot;  On &quot;Great Expectations&quot;, Simmons' vocal doesn't really fit the blandness of the music and the inclusion of a boys choir just seems silly and odd.  &quot;Flaming Youth&quot;, on the other hand - a rare collaboration between Simmons, Stanley and guitarist Ace Frehley - is a great 70's rock song and deserved to be featured prominently in live performance but, to my knowledge, never has been.  Simmons' &quot;Sweet Pain&quot;, an homage to sadism, is pretty uninteresting.  &quot;Shout it out Loud&quot;, however, with it's call-and-response vocals and fist-in-the-air chorus, probably sounds a lot better than it has a right to.  The mega-hit from &quot;Destroyer&quot;, Peter Criss' tender &quot;Beth&quot; is just beautiful.  The song is a classic ballad and there's just no getting around the potency of it's union of words and melody.  Stanley's &quot;Do You Love Me&quot; probably best represents the overall tone of the album - It's very simple, probably over-produced, but there's enough there to keep you interested.  No Kiss fan would be without &quot;Destroyer&quot; in his or her collection, as the album represents an important turning point in the band's direction.  But based on the strength of the music alone, &quot;Destroyer&quot; gets a good, solid C-plus.
B000001DVD|5.0|1981 saw a change in Def Leppard they would be joined by producer Mutt Lange who would also go on to produce pyromania and Hysteria.  This is my personal favorite among the early def leppard releases.  I have the import cd with 2 extra tracks remixes of bringin on the heartache and me and my wine.  This is pure British rock at its finest (goes to show how important both Pete and Steve were)  Everything was top notch playing wise and singing was great as well.  The main reason I like the album is due to the fact it wasn't overproduced or polished.  I would recommend this to any hard rock fan.
B00000DQSZ|5.0|TEE is a synth masterpeice. Listening to it and comparing it to 90's techno, the sound has evolved, but their influence has ovibously stayed. Every song on the CD is masterful. I must, however, Franz Schubert to the attention of you. While a little short, it's very nice to listen to. Of course, the title track is nothing to deride. TEE is simply great music.
B000001F7R|5.0|This is truely where it began for the boys from up north.  11 tracks of pure bliss no real filler so to speak in my top 5 of all time easy.  My favorite cuts are Wasted sorrow is a woman rocks off and overture.  It is a real shame that the band completely ignore this when it comes to the live act.  Too bad there now just a pop band deserate for a hit.
B000002HH2|4.0|This album is a mix of some really great songs, and some bad ones. Army of Me, while a decent song, does not allow Bjork to use her amazingly expressive voice, which is what makes her so good. Hyperballad is the best Bjork song ever, and the song that got me hooked on her. The Modern Things is good, not incredible. It's Oh So Quiet is awesome, great change of pace. Enjoy is decent, but sounds more like a song for Homogenic or Vespertine. You've Been Flirting Again bores me to death every time, I usually skip it. Isobel rocks, good beat and melody. Possibly Maybe also rocks, and falls just short of Hyperballad for the best lyrics on the album. I miss you is an embarrasment, along with the worst Bjork music video I've ever seen. The band that kicks in at about 2:00 saves it a little. Cover me is pretty boring too. Headphones is cool if you listen to it with headphones on.<br />Overall its not the best Bjork album, but you should buy it just for Hyperballad, It's Oh So Quiet, and Isobel.
B0000542D2|4.0|When I was a kid growing up in Germany in the late 50's, I used to see a lot of British comedies in the US Army theaters; I don't know if they made it to the US.  I didn't get all of the humor, but I remember these films being uniquely humorous, particularly the &quot;Carry On&quot; series.  When I saw &quot;Hard Day's Night&quot; it reminded me of these clever black &amp; white films, which is why it is much more than a rock &amp; roll film.  The only other British rock movie I remember enjoying was the Dave Clark 5's &quot;Having a Wild Weekend&quot; which I recall having a sad ending at Mont St Michel in France.  I'm glad HDN finally made it to video.
B000002HPV|5.0|I love all the Bjork albums, but Homogenic might be my favorite and I'll tell you why. Debut and Post are more mainstream, with structured songs and techno-like beats predominating. Vespertine is towards the other end of the spectrum, with rythmically unstructured, &quot;modern&quot; songs predominating(An Echo A Stain, Sun in My Mouth). Homogenic falls in the middle. It has some songs that could very easily been on Post, and some that could have been on Vespertine. Homogenic also has the best music videos. Hunter, Joga, and All is Full of Love are some of the best videos I've seen if you can find them. I recommend finding the Strings Remix to All is Full of Love (its in the video), its at least as good as the original if not better. Joga may be the best Bjork song ever.
B00006J3WH|5.0|One of the BEST SHOWS on television. Great Sound Track.<BR>Even the other character portraits are good, but that big Sarah G head on the cover just stinks. That painter claimed a salary for that?
B00005O5JV|4.0|'Legally Blonde' surpassed everyone's expectations last year when it became one of the most successful movies of last summer, even in blockbuster season.  The story has Elle Woods (Witherspoon) as the blonde sorority girl who is dumped by her boyfriend because she's not smart enough for him.  Determined to prove him wrong she enrolls in Harvard Law School, whereupon she finds he's now engaged to Selma Blair.  But she's prepared to steal him back as well as ace her degree.<br />Okay, so the plot is a bunch of fluff that's as empty-headed as the sorority types it tries so desperately to lampoon but with Witherspoon on board it's impossible not to root for her.  It's pretty near impossible to read a review that doesn't make at least one reference to the comic genius that was Witherspoon in the biting satire 'Election', and such comic timing is on full display here.  Brimming with sexual attitude, naivity and an endearing determination Witherspoon fleshes out the role of Elle admirably.  Even with the clichéd story (you can tell right from the get-go who Elle will end up with) she keeps you watching right up until the very end.<br />Still, I don't mean to write off the rest of the people involved in the movie completely because there are plenty of good ideas and observations here.  The fact that the clique of sorority girls are, at Harvard, the underdog is a nice reversal of roles that works incredibly well.  Still, you do suspect that without Witherspoon on board this would be just another teen movie.  But as it is, 'Legally Blonde' positively bubbles with enthusiasm that you'd have to have a heart of stone not to enjoy at least some of it.
B000068TSI|4.0|If you have a desire to see a realistic portrayal of what the Vietnam War was really all about in the mid to late sixties, you need to see \\"We Were Soldiers\\". <BR>  Based on a book co-authored by Colonel Hal Moore, this movie depicts an account of the actual happenings at Landing Zone X-Ray as the United States forces, numbering 400, faced 2000 Vietnamese soldiers, as they attempted to prove the feasibility of helicopter-assisted deployment of ground troops into hostile territory.<BR>  Directed by Randall Wallace and released in 2002, this movie features Mel Gibson in the leading role as Colonel Hal Moore, Commander of his division of the 7th Cavalry. Colonel Moore's wife is portrayed by Madelaine Stowe. Sam Elliot is in a supporting role as Colonel Moore's second in command. The running time for this film is 138 minutes.<BR>  Set in various places, from the training camp to the battlefield, this film depicts the classic struggle of man against man. The plot follows the actual, although at times dramaticized, account of the happenings during the United States first encounter with the North Vietnamese in what would eventually become the Vietnam War.<BR>  I gave this movie a four star rating, because the acting seemed to be somewhat stiff, especially in the case of Mel Gibson, and to a lesser extent Sam Elliot. I am used to seeing these actors connect better with the audience. No warm fuzzies here, more down to business with the cold, hard facts. However, I don't know the gentlemen they portrayed personally, so it is possible these were accurate representations of the men involved. Only their families know for sure.<BR>  I believe this movie was more disturbing than \\"Saving Private Ryan\\", although \\"Ryan\\" probably wins the gore factor comparison. What I found to be most disturbing was the apparent expendable nature of the U.S. soldiers portrayed. When the engagement was over, I was somewhat at a loss to determine what was won, or who really won. Perhaps that is the message of this movie, no one really wins when it comes to war.
B00006J3T4|5.0|This album represents the latest step in the continued evolution of Knopfler's music, focusing more on the folk styles than his prior entries. As such, it sounds a lot closer to his brother, David Knopfler's, releases - which is not a bad thing. There is also an entry that is very reminiscent of his work with Chet Atkins, titled &quot;Daddy's Gone to Knoxville&quot;. What you won't find are hard-rock songs like &quot;Money For Nothing&quot; or &quot;Heavy Fuel&quot;, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.<br />All in all, I found it a much stronger album overall than &quot;Sailing to Philadelphia&quot; and a very strong entry in his catalog. Combining his trademark evocative lyrics with a painstaking attention to melodies and musical detail, no fan of Knopfler should let this one pass by unlistened.
B0000542D2|3.0|How disappointing!  Unlike previous releases of this movie on VHS and DVD, this one does not use the actual stereo soundtracks for the music interludes.  What you have here is enhanced mono of the songs.  I'll stick with my MPI version with stereo music, thank you.
B00003CXAE|5.0|Finally, one of cinema's all-time favorite musicals has made it to DVD! Grease - a long awaited dvd release of mine -- holds that magic that makes a film a rounded complete cinema classic.<br /> Everyone knows the story of the Rydell High group, each going through their own little quirks and some getting share that through amazing song and wonderful dance. It's awesome how director Randal Kleiser combined the main plot of Danny and Sandy with subtle subplots such as Rizzo and Kenickie (Which - in a way - are the main stars of the Broadway version), the Thunder Road ordeal, and Frenchie's dropping out of school for beauty school. The cast is an awesome group of talent. Olivia Newton-John and John Travolta as our leads are captivating with the best moves and wonderful voices. Jeff Conaway and Stockard Channing add that sufficient racy attitude into the film with their smirky one-liners and great voices. The rest of the Thunderbirds and Pink Ladies were all great assets to the film and are memorable in their own way. Especially Didi Conn and her voice. Loved the lady.<br /> Although I praise the movie highly, the DVD is a the littlest bit of a disappointment. We do get the film in anamorphic widescreen and the nifty original theatrical trailer, but there's nothing new in regards to bonus features. We get the same interviews that can be found on the 20th Anniversary special VHS edition (Which aren't bad, but I've seen it so many times). But there's nothing more than that. Warner Bros. did treat us to a nifty packaging, but the menus aren't gawkable. All in all, the DVD presentation is a fair one.<br /> Grease is a piece of cinema classic fare if there ever was one. Disagree with me? It's okay. But I know me, a fan, and tons of others agree with that statement.
B000069AUI|4.0|Armed with spiralling pianos and falsetto vocals Coldplay follow-up the huge commercial success of 'Parachutes'with a sequel for even indie giants Radiohead to envy.  Debut single 'In my place' isolates opener 'Politik' but its infectious guitar melody warrants its immediate selection.  Chris Martin's cracked vocals reach their highlight in the title track as he echos 'Honey..' before engaging upon a flowing chorus. Ultimately a piano-fuelled album, its complimented with an implicit guitar role which lifts the album's highlight 'The Scientist', an emotional portrayal of lost love which builds steadily to produce a breathtaking ballad. Coldplay have grown and with age have furthered the maturity and sophistication of their music without losing the simplistic edge which distances them from the electronica rock of rival musicians.
B00006J3WH|5.0|In November of 2001, it was official. Joss Whedon was a total genuis. Once More, With Feeling premiered on UPN to the eyes of Buffy fans and non-alike, and it made television history. Mucho thanks to Joss Whedon's brilliant writing of the lyrics, and the surprising singing talents of the cast of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. All of the songs speak in the mythos of Buffy, and are sung by its cast superbly and &quot;with feeling.&quot; Sarah Michelle Gellar's voice is soft and powerful in Going Through the Motions, Walk Through the Fire, and Something to Sing About. Nicholas Brendon and Emma Caulfield are quirky and amazing in their true Broadway number, I'll Never Tell. Amber Benson shows she has a wonderful voice in Under Your Spell whilst Anthony Stewart Head showcases his musical talent in Standing. There are many more collaborations with the whole cast which are truly listenable with no downsides. There are also little hilarious songs with cameos from producers David Greenwalt (Mustard Stain) and Marti Noxon (Parking Ticket). The orchastral scores from the episodes Hush, Restless, and The Gift were a nice addition. Especially that of The Gift. And to hear Joss Whedon and his wife sing Something to Sing About is an extra that will be enjoyed.<BR> <BR> Once More, with Feeling was critically-acclaimed and praised by everyone. It was a disgrace that the Emmy people ignored this piece (Although it did get a minor nom, it didn't win). But what really matters is that we fans know that Joss Whedon and cast's talent is really shown here.
B00005LOUQ|4.0|Its the classic tale of the hate-filled outcast who with time grows to be accepted into society.  In this instance, the Grinch, a hideous abnormality that lives off his passion for yuletide misery, is eventually persuaded from obscurity to join the Whos in their picture-perfect village.  Under the layers of leathery green skin, Jim Carrey is instantly recogniseable as he writhes and extends his facial features to the limit capturing the loveable rogue stature perfectly. Ron Howard's takes charge of the direction and provides an magical yet comprehendable depiction of the dedicated Whos as they prepare for the festivities. Its not laugh a minute entertainment but it is inventively produced and provides a credible reproduction of Dr Seuss classic childrens stories.  Hilarious in parts and cringeworthy in others, this is family fun encroaching upon the the best in DVD entertainment.
B000059TFO|5.0|I remember watching this movie in a Florida movie theater when it first came out (I was stationed at Orlando Naval Base back then). Watching the movie was an overwhelming emotional experience, and many scenes shook me to the core with their raw emotional power. Mississippi Burning is THE definitive movie about the atmosphere of racism and violence that pervaded the Civil Rights era, with its dead on accurate portrayal and recreation of a small 60's Southern town. We get to intimately know the kinds of places where 3 young men, or any individuals interested in the plight of the oppressed, might disappear or get killed in the 60's South. We understand what it was like to be Black and live in such a divided society. Most important, we know that evil racism has no logical explanation save for the fact that it is taught and learned from one generation to the next.<br />This movie has been unfairly and recklessly attacked by overeager movie critics and experts on social affairs, all of whom feel guilty about praising such an important and powerful piece of film making (they don't DARE want to be called racist for praising the film!). <br />The most common criticism is that this movie doesn't have any strong Black characters. This is absolutely false. There are several strong Black characters in this movie. There is a scene where a Black preacher gives a strong condemnation about the killings of the young men. There are several scenes with a brave young Black child, deeply religious, who somehow manages to find courage amongst his tears and fright (in one exceptional scene, he doesn't run away during a Klan disruption of a church gathering, instead, he kneels and prays). And in the most controversial and powerful scene in the entire movie, a strong Black father (father of the previously mentioned young boy), fed up with the racists, goes out into the night with a shotgun shouting that he will not take this abuse anymore.<br />The other major criticism is that the movie focuses on White characters. This is not valid. I do certainly agree that many Hollywood movies tend to center the action around White actors, even if the story is about minorities (i.e., Come See the Paradise, Windtalkers, etc. etc.) However, this is one case where it was absolutely necessary for the story to be seen through the eyes of two White FBI agents. The two White agents (Gene Hackman in one of the greatest movie performances of all time) represent the opposite spectrum of the evil Southern racists. Just as the Southerners see the world in their segregated view, the two FBI agents see the world in their enlightened and open view, and in fact they stand for many White people that not only gave their lives for the cause of Civil Rights, but made their voices heard and actions seen so that segregation would one day end. The Civil Rights era is as much a story about White Americans as it is Black Americans, so I applaud the filmmakers for being courageous about this.<br />I recently watched the DVD version and it affected me as much as when I first saw it, and I make it a point to see several times a year. There are scenes that are so heartbreaking they will leave you in tears, and moments of beauty and power so self assured that you know you are watching a masterpiece that will one day stand the test of time. This movie is required viewing for all of the youth in America today, many of whom are clueless as to the Civil Rights period (and others simply do not care).
B00005Y228|5.0|Kylie Minogue is the queen of dance of the new millenium. The combination of songs are incredible! With a beautiful body to go with the ..., sultry voice... \\"Love at first sight,\\" to me, is hands down the best dance song of the year. The video and choreography is great. The bonus tracks are awesome ( \\"Butterfly,\\" and \\"Boys\\"). If you feel alright now, get the cd and you'll get a \\"fever\\" like that!
B00006J3WH|5.0|I love, let me repeat, LOVE the Buffy musical! I've been a Buffy fan since day one, and this was absolutely one of the best hours on the show...and television! My favorite episode is The Gift,and I was so happy to see &quot;Sacrifice&quot; on this album because it's such a beautiful theme. I was not excited about the suites from Hush and Restless, but after listening to them, I am glad they are there! Restless really has a beautiful score, and Hush always makes my heart beat faster! This is just absolutely brilliant!<BR> I was very excited that they put out the soundtrack, and I am very glad I got it. It's not the same with some of the speaking parts cut out, but after seeing the show so many times, I can just put them in myself. This is an amazing soundtrack, and all of the actors on the show have such amazing talent! Definitely a must-have for Buffy fans, or anyone in general!
B00005R2M3|5.0|...Shakira really throws a 1, 2 punch with this cd...Laundry Service is a great crossover cd. \\"Whenever, wherever\\" was just a preview of what you are getting. Excellent cd. Knowing she wrote ever song is even better. She didn't even know english before this, and still delivered a great selection of music. Forget 5 stars... 10 stars are more like it.
B00004WG2X|5.0|I've seen this tape 11 times and find that it rings the truest of the three versions available.<br />What makes this production so exciting is Elizabeth Garvey.  At last someone played Elizabeth Bennett with spunk instead of archly smirking into the camera.  It's easy to see why someone like Darcy would find her so fascinating. <br />Mr. Collins character was so beautifully drawn that I kept rewinding to see what this amazing actor's technique was for redefining fatuousness.<br />Alas, David Rintoul played Darcy in such a wooden way that it was often distracting.  Where was Laurence Olivier when we needed him?<br />If you love Jane Austen, please see this version; you owe it to yourself.
B00005OM4N|5.0|What more can I say. <BR>1. \\"Slave,\\" is hands down the best song of her career. She really crossed over with this song. Neptunes did her right!!!<BR>2. \\"Overprotected\\" is nother great song. The \\"Darkchild remix\\" is way better though.<BR>3. \\"Lonely\\" is alright. She has a nice rap that goes with it.<BR>4. \\"Not a girl...\\" is the only slow song on the LP. while your dancing on the first three songs, she sure does slow it down, literally.<BR>5. \\"Boys\\" is a great funky song. Shows her sexy side. The Neptunes did it again. <BR>6. \\"Anticipating\\" has a upbeat to it. If your down, this song will cheer you up.<BR>7. \\"Cinderella\\" the worst song. has a space, Star Trek sample in it, I think.<BR>8. \\" Let me..\\" is one of the best songs on the cd. She really belts out her frustration on this song.<BR>9. \\" Boombostic Love\\" is a great song, but if you hear i well enough, I may sound like \\" most Girls\\" by Pink<BR>10. \\"That's where you take me\\" is a good club song. It has that r and b feel to it and you can dance to it.<BR>11. \\" What its like to be me\\" duet with justin timberlake is a good song. Really hard core. Those two have good chemistry.<br />The highs are \\" Slave,\\" and \\"like to be me.\\" The lows are \\" Not a girl\\" and \\"cindrella.\\" She really matures on this cd.<br />5 STARS plus 4.
B00005OAIE|5.0|It's rare to hear such a well written and \\"honest\\" ( Not sounding pop or fake) CD. John Mayer's raspy voice cuts through the backgroung guitar straight to your heart with this CD that leaves you wondering what he'll do next.
B00005R2M3|5.0|One of my favorite albums of all time! I can't think of another artist as talented as Shakira (Madonna probably, in her own way).  But if you are still thinking about buying this album, JUST DO IT!
B00006J3WH|5.0|I loved OMWF and I almost wore my tape out listening to all the songs.  With the CD, I can listen over and over without worrying about wearing out the tape!!  It's great to hear all the orchestrations and the clarity of all the voices that you can't hear on the television.  Joss and his wife's demo is great too!!!
B00005R2M3|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums of all times!  I can't think of another artist as talented as Shakira (Madonna, probably in her own way).  You have to buy this one!
B00003W8NM|4.0|Beautiful, intricate, inventive filmmaking until the climax -- when a dumb-as-a-brick ending spoils the whole thing. But still absolutely worth seeing for the knockout performances, great writing, awesome cinematography and ferocious momentum of the plot.  Skates brilliantly along the edge of reality -- until those last few minutes, when it just throws in the towel. You'll groan.  But see it anyway.
B000066F6H|1.0|You know what?  People who like all this retro mod [stuff] (which is NOT punk, not at all) should all drive off the same cliff with the rap-metal fans and the pop fans.  ARGH . . . every year since about 1993, I've said to myself, \\"No, THIS is the worst year to be a music fan.\\"  I'm proven wrong YET AGAIN this year.  It's a damn good thing there are actually still one or two bands out there making actual music.  This, however, is NOT one of those bands.  It is blasphemy to even compare this pile of ... with MC5, it's not even close.  MC5 is a classic band, untouchable in the annals of history.  Is this an [inexpensive] Rolling Stones knockoff?  Why, yes, yes, it is, and a bad [inexpensive] knock off at that.  I don't even like the Stones and I feel sorry for them right now.<br />In summary, there's never been a better time to blow up your radio.
B000002542|5.0|OK,so there is more to be said about Journey's debut album.It is not only the best release by the talented and prolific Bay Area rockers,but one of the truly great albums of 70's rock,period.<BR>From the opening notes of &quot;Of A Lifetime&quot;,until the last notes of &quot;Mystery Mountain&quot;,it was obvious to listeners that a new powerhouse of guitar based hard rock had emerged.Without slighting the other band members,it must be said that the self-titled debut displayed Neal Schon as the premier guitar player of his generation.Ross Valory was without doubt one of the finest bassist's in the land and Ansley Dunbar had his best moments on this release.Greg Rolie's vocals are warm and convincing,and are far less annoying than that later singer...um,what's his name?<BR>Well,enough of this lavish praise of the musicians,and on to the songs.<BR>&quot;Of A Lifetime&quot;,a staple of Bay Area rock radio of the time,it still has the right stuff.<BR>&quot;In The Morning Day&quot;,the swirling phased drumming blew my mind 27 years ago.Still does.<BR>&quot;Kohoutek&quot;,has more in common with Mahavishnu Orchestra than the pablum Journey would later produce.This song is simply a masterpiece.Yes,really.<BR>&quot;To Play Some Music&quot;,a song that would lay the groundwork for the guitar heavy rock that would fill the air waves for the next twenty years.They were often introduced live as &quot;The Pride Of The West Coast&quot;,and this would be the opening number of the show.See why this moniker was well deserved.<br />&quot;Topaz&quot;,seldom will you hear a better mix of jazz groove and rocking fury.I am not kidding.AMAZING bass and drums here!<BR>&quot;In My Lonely Feeling/Conversations&quot;,the high point of the album,the high point of Journey's career,in my humble opinion.<BR>A powerful bluesy start with crushing drum licks turns into a<BR>off-time jazzy jam with the most beautiful playing of both Ross Valory's and Neal Schon's career's.On a scale of one to ten,this tune is a twelve.I do not exaggerate.<BR>&quot;Mystery Mountain&quot;,the weakest song on the album.Another heavy rocker in the vein of &quot;Of A Lifetime&quot;,it still easily surpass's most of the work that would follow in later years.<BR>So...Lets review,<BR>Great talented musicians,powerful,guitar based songs,amazing performance's.<BR>Some of the best music of the era,what's not to love?
B00005J6T1|3.0|Madonna's debut is a remarkable dance album with a sound of its own, influenced by but not slavishly reflecting the dance/club styles of the early 1980s. Her voice is down in the mix but this works somehow. The best tracks include Lucky Star, Borderline, Holiday and the harder-edged Burning Up. I somehow cannot imagine that most fans of her subsequent albums would like this one very much, as it's so different from her later pop vocal style. My main complaint is the lack of variety, but the aforementioned songs do have melodic appeal.
0694003611|5.0|I have a friend who has recently become an elementary school teacher and is teaching kindergarten. She talked me into coming in to read to her class--any book(s)I wanted to bring with me.<br />My reading gig is coming up this week so this past weekend I asked my 16 year old daughter to go through her old children's books (she has 50-60 of her old favorites still on a bookshelf in her room) and she emerged with 2 or three books for the kid's but also with Goodnight Moon--which she wanted me to read to her.<br />As Miss Zoe was growing up we'd read every night and Zoe (my daughter) got to choose what we read. She'd usually pick 2 to 3 books and, for years and years, Goodnight Moon was always one of them.<br />The book itself is somewhat inexplicable--mostly it's just a silly little poem, really--but for my kids it really struck a chord. All I know is that if your sixteen year old daughter wants to curl up on the couch and have you read one of her childhood books to her, that's quite a book.<br />I always give this to friends when they have a first baby, and I have always found that a few years later they are still telling me it is their kid's favorite book.<br />So don't try to figure it out, just buy it and read it to your kids. It'll be a treasure you share for years.
B00000J2PH|4.0|This album appeared in the heyday of the sensitive singer/songwriter boom and is still a classic of the genre, like James Taylor's Sweet Baby James which preceded it. The sound is sparse, arranged with moody piano and gentle drums accompanying her intimate observations in an unassuming vocal style. The lyrics are poetic and moving, especially on You've Got A Friend and It's Too Late. But I could never properly assimilate her versions of Natural Woman and Will You Love Me Tomorrow?, since the original versions are simply better. The two new tracks are welcome additions to a pleasant listening experience. Expressive and superbly woven together, Tapestry is an enduring classic that has stood the test of time very well.
B0000542D2|3.0|My copy of A Hard Day's Night came this morning.  I was very disappointed in the sound.  I didn't know why; but a friend of mine from the great state of Georgia, David Powell who knows his stuff sent me information that made me realize why I was not so happy with it.<br />&quot;The new DVD re-release of A Hard Day's Night seems to be a controversial subject of debate on many internet forums. Let me see if I can get this right -- The movie was originally in mono. For the new DVD they've gone back to the stereo mixes of the songs to create a 5.1 surround mix. The movie's dialogue, however, is still mono, so it switches to stereo only during the featured songs. The trouble is that the DVD's 5.1 stereo mix sounds worse than the original 2 channel stereo versions of the songs. Rather than spacious, the music has evidently been compressed for this digital version. There is some talk also that certain songs, such as &quot;Can't Buy Me Love&quot;, are actually just re-processed mono rather than true stereo. <br />If all this sounds confusing -- it really is, the new DVD apparently uses the wrong aspect ratio for the picture!&quot;

B000065V41|5.0|We have loved this movie from the first time we saw it.  The music is unbelievable and a testament to the song writing talent of Paul Williams.  What we enjoy the most is you have to remind yourself that you are watching muppets.  This movie is a Christmas Eve tradition in our home and will be for years to come.
B00006BIO0|5.0|JSP has always come through in the realm of remastering essential<br />music from the pre-war era. This fact had me champing at the bit when I saw that they were preparing a release of The Complete Charley Patton. This set contains essentially the same music as is found on the first five discs of the Revenant Set.<br />All songs recorded that Cholly appears on are found in this set. The BIG difference is that \\"The Masked Marvel\\"(probably John R.T. Davies or Ted Kendall) has finally done justice remastering the existing records and has succeeded in squeezing blood from the turnip that is known as Paramount Records.(infamous for manufacturing records that sounded like sandpaper when they were brand new!) At first I was very skeptical but after listening to just a few tracks my jaw dropped. None of the ear bleeding stridency of the Revenant masters and none of that blanket over the speakers masking that I heard on the Catfish Box. The music is alive and Cholly's voice is PRESENT. Obviously, there is no cure for the physical damage that is found on some of these relics but on the remaining sides there is pure enjoyment. Along with the best Patton remastering yet, you'll get to hear Son House, Louise Johnson, and Willie Brown's historic contributions to the legendary 1930 Paramount sessions at their best too. I can't stop raving. Enjoy!!!!
B000000P11|5.0|I can't say enough about this album. It's got a signature guitar sound, 80's sound production, unique vocals, dark lyrics. It's a very memorable recording from start to finish. I remember 5 years ago when I thought it was a terrible shame that this classic wasn't available on CD. Now that it's available for you to enjoy, I strongly recommend you give it a listen.
B00005QZ7U|3.0|This is definitely one of the most individual and original movies I have ever seen, and it actually warrants multiple viewings, but only if you are truly interested in cinema. Because after three times watching this (masterpiece? mess?) I still cannot decide what I think of it.<br />There is some great work here. This is not like anything you have seen before. The editing, the set design, the photography is not for everyone, but it is what it is. You cannot really say that it is bad. He acheived exactly what he wanted to. In a world of cookie cutter films where the most mundane ideas are transformed into bland, passive entertainment, this film dares you to like it on its own terms.<br />And yet...<br />How can a film that is so dazzling to look at have the most boring dialog ever? I can understand how the story is kept simple. These kinds of films (Titanic, etc.) need to be because it is more about the emotion than the story. But, the words coming out of these actors' mouths are just plain dull. Nothing quotable. You don't ever sit around and quote Moulin Rouge. Heck, the only thing that people ever do quote is the line from &quot;Nature Boy&quot; (The only thing you'll ever learn...). <br />The film takes big missteps in several key scenes, most of all with the initial love scenes between Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman, mainly the absolutely horrible medley of love songs that they sing to each other. A moment that should take us to the next level ala Leo Dicaprio sketching Kate Winslet, but it falls flat. Kidman trying to be funny in her first scene with McGregor and later with the Duke are totally miscalculated. You just stare at the screen and wonder when the scene will end.<br />Better moments include Jim Broadbent singing &quot;Like A Virgin&quot; and the final love song with Kidman and McGregor, which actually acheives what the the entire movie tries to--a moment of magic.<br />I applaud all involved for swinging for the fences on this one. Baz Luhrman needsto hire a screenwriter who can write memorable dialogue, and believe it or not, he needs to get a better editor, so that he can excise some scenes entirely instead of just using him to cut, cut, cut.<br />An incredibly interesting film, not a big success, but also not a failure. We at least need more efforts like this.
B00006F7S4|5.0|I have to agreee with several other reviewers that the &quot;sadness&quot; of this album is NOT a defect.  It is not petty, angry, or whiny (see Fiona Apple).  It is beautiful and poignant, and it makes me feel like listening to new music again.
0375707972|5.0|The Reader<br />Sadness. Sadness permeates this beautiful little novel like a winter fog. It imperceptibly closes round the story enveloping the reader with the characters, drawing them together for what little warmth they can find. The characters themselves are not unlovable, in fact Hanna the anti-heroine and subject of the story is quite ordinary - she is a conductress with a tram company - but her secrets isolate her even from her youthful lover. <BR>The narrator, the Reader of the title, is a nameless, blameless individual who accidentally stumbles into Hanna's world one afternoon in his mid teens. The love affair which ensues follows a fairly ordinary trajectory until one day Hanna is gone, no explanation, no recrimination, only his youthful tears at his loss, but, well, he'll soon get over that. And he does. <BR>As a child of the WWII generation he enters law school and amongst his studies are the judgements of Nuremberg and the ongoing pursuit and trial of the participants from his parents generation. Hanna, of course, is part of it and his next view of her is as a defendant in a concentration camp trial. If this was an ordinary novel then it could slide at this point into the familiar rehash of confused motives and idealism with which we are all too aware. But it's not. Schlink is more thoughtful and more literary than that. He takes this as a starting point and allows Hanna's tragic story to unfold. Her former lover, her former friend, as an embryonic lawyer with a conscience, sees it as natural justice that she should be punished with a long jail sentence. He can dismiss her and march on into his new world. Except his own world is almost as messy as hers and time slowly pushes them together again. Not together enough for him to ever forgive her. Her crimes are too heinous and she has tainted him by association, but enough for him to start sending her books, novels which he has dictated onto cassettes, but cassettes only, no greetings, no enquiries, no news, only the audio books - The Reader of the title. And that is how he appeases his guilt, audio books to make her feel better, his voice because she loved him to read to her, but real communication would be going too far. <BR>It would be wrong to release the ending of the story, wrong to reveal how the gulf between the two of them is finally crossed but, as with the fog on a cold January afternoon, the dampness persists even when you come indoors. <BR>Schlink has tried, successfully, to show what it means to have your parents mistakes on your conscience but equally, how do you avoid them yourself ? The tawdry Jewess who features near the end of the novel refuses to show any signs of forgiving or of understanding, even when the Reader explains to her that Hanna could never have committed the crimes for which she was imprisoned. Hanna's crimes are passed from country to country, residing at present in Palestine, and, ominously, from generation to generation.<BR>A novel, presumably perfect in the original (I read the translation by J C B, a work of art itself), which will haunt your memory long after the book is closed.
0671027344|3.0|Charlie, the narrator of this book, has an interesting, observant writing style.  There isn't much dialog in this book, so you basically need to imagine the other characters from Charlies observations about them.  Charlie writes some really hilarious things, such as, \\"Do you know what 'masturbation' is?  I think you probably do because you're older than me.  But just in case, I will tell you.  Masturbation is when you rub your genitals until you have an orgasm.  Wow!\\"  This kind of passage is very common in \\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower.\\"  A lot of other reviewers said that Charlie comes from a typical, functional family, but I strongly disagree.  Charlie takes drugs, his Grandfather is an alcoholic, and his aunt was molested.  The thing I didn't like about this book was that it didn't have a very clear plot and the ending left a lot of things unfinished.  Charlie seems to have a very scattered train of thought, so the different letters continuesly change topics, without finishing up the previous one.  (Just so you know, this book is sort of like a diary, but instead of starting each entry with \\"Dear Diary,\\" Charlie writes, \\"Dear Friend.\\"  I wouldn't buy this,..., but check it out from your local library if you're between the ages of 15-25.
B00003CXZ1|2.0|I am a big fan of 'heroine' action movies, and so I was glad to watch this one.  Angela Jolie, stars as the pouty-lipped, heroine \\"Lara Croft.\\"<br />This is the story of Lara's discovery of a mysterious clock, hidden in the immense Croft mansion. The clock holds the key to a mystical device which is coveted by an evil cult (aren't they all?) Can Croft prevent the key from falling into the wrong hands?<br /> Angela Jolie does her best to breath life into the buxom action heroine, but it was a difficult task. The movie (loosely based upon the videogame) has a meandering action plot, (which seemed to be designed to show Jolie's figure to its best advantage) and an immense special effects budget which might feed a small third world country.<br />While not utterly terrible, in a world of 'video-game' knockoff movies such as 'mortal Kombat' , I can't honestly say that Tomb Raider had much to recommend it unless you are missing your dose of eyecandy for the week. Good for a laugh, but nothing to take to seriously. Next...!!!
B000063DHK|5.0|By this album if you don't already own it.<br />'Live after Death' is a turning point for Maiden, and music in general. It could no longer be said about Maiden that they were 'on the rise.' With this album (and tour) they cemented their status as THE central players in 1980s rock. <br />But with this distinction comes a sense of loss. I know many longtime fans who say that Maiden was never quite the same after 'Live...', and it may be true: Keyboards in 'Somewhere in Time'? I Like 'Somewhere...' but let's not forget this was the same band who dissed the synth-sound in the liner notes of 'Piece of Mind'! <br />'Live after Death' marks the consolidation of Maiden's signature form and style, which they, unfortunately, stuck rather close to in the following decade. Their utter sincerity, deadly-serious exploration of mythic and historic themes, and sheer musical virtuosity - all of which were considered assets in the 1980s - became a liability in the irony-soaked 1990s. And yet, 'Live after Death' is still charged with a sense of excitement, of 'not-quite-thereness', of playful insecurity that accompanies a band striving towards the absolute highest echelons of Rockdom. It was a Faustian bargain, however, since the band had to forever abdicate its 'outsider' status in order to achieve this. In a sense, I take the title, \\"Live After Death,' as an unintended irony. Something did indeed die after this live album.<br />I like 'Live after Death'. It's a kick in the pants, unapologetic metal album. Do you remember a time in music when a band could take pride in their craft? When they didn't have to shy away from technique? When the catchphrase of the moment wasn't 'whatever' or 'nevermind'? When people meant what they said; when absolute clairity, even in madness, was valued above all else? <br />Buy 'Live After Death' and rock hard.
B00006J3WH|3.0|The songs sound great on this cd but my only complaint is that no dialogue was used.  It would have made the songs sound more like they came from the episode if for example, the dialogue between Buffy and Spike was used before he started his song to her.  Without the dialogue, it just sounds like the different characters performing songs for no reason.  Also the dialogue between Buffy and Dawn wasn't used on the Gift score. It was nice to get more score music on the cd though. I hope that a score cd containing all of the music from all the seasons will be released soon.  Score cds have been done for the X-Files, Xena, Hercules and countless other shows.  Why not Buffy?
B000002WNP|5.0|Every generation has its idol.  One of my grandmothers was a Rudolph Valentino fan.  Some later generations had James Dean.  More recently, there is Elvis.  I purchased this collection as a gift for a very good friend who is an Elvis fan.  It is an extensive collection of his music from the peak of his career.  This is a 5 CD set with 130 tracks and includes songs such as &quot;It's Now or Never,&quot; &quot;Are You Lonesome Tonight,&quot; &quot;Fools Fall in Love,&quot; &quot;I'll Remember You,&quot; &quot;You Don't Know Me,&quot; &quot;Gentle on My Mind,&quot; &quot;Love Me Tender,&quot; and many more.  Some are alternate cuts.  The set is well boxed and makes a good gift.
B00006F7S4|5.0|Beck has ran a continuum of pop music throughout his career.  Fans will know that you never really know what to expect from the Beckster.  I bought Sea Change the day it was released, and had read 0 reviews.  Being a long time fan I was anxious to hear his ecclectic pop styles yet again.  It seems so long since I first enjoyed the beauty of Mutations and could still jam to Odelay and Vultures on a daily basis.  This album is evident of the break-up.  He pins his heart to his sleave and puts his diary to music.  It's simply a beautiful album that allows you to feel his every emotion.  You will never appreciate the beauty of his voice until you listen to this album.  I swear the song I Guess I'm Doing Fine could be the cousin of the great I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry.  This far from the most energetic album Beck has released, but it is undoubtedly his best work EVER.  The emotions and the arrangements really pay off on Sea Change.  Support Beck and buy this album, his work is worth every cent.  Much Peace To All!
B00000ILDE|4.0|Aliens is on nearly everyone's short list of all time great action films. I won't bother to rehash story line others have done it better than I would be willing to do. Instead I would like to address the prevelant notion amoung other reviewers that Aliens is a \\"Far\\" superior work than its progenitor Alien. I think this is a mistake, although an easy one to make. As similar as these two films may seem on the surface the are really quite different. We love Aliens for the same reason we love a rollercoaster. It is unrelenting action from begining to end, with Ripley and Knute providing the sweet soft filling of this treat. James Cameron described it as \\"Vietnam in space\\". As Americans we -if box office means anything- prefer action to Sci-Fi. Aliens is one of the greatest action pictures and Alien is its equal in the Sci-Fi genere. You may prefer oranges to apples but you cant prove superiority. <BR>  Mobius's and Giger's work is so apart of pop culture now. In the afterbirth of 2001 and Star Wars, Alien went its own way with its organic\industrial hybrid look we are so accustomed to seeing today. It is easy to forget how truly influential and unique Alien was and contiues to be. Yes, Cameron's action packed Aliens is the next logical step for the series to take, but he does it standing squarely on Scott's shoulders.
B000063CPL|5.0|Those of us old enough to remember, Iron Maiden was the best live metal band in the '80's.  Better than Metallica, better than Priest, better than you name it.  I lost track of Maiden about ten years ago.  They did continue to put out albums, but with different lineup configurations.  In 2000, they put out what has to be called the greatest comeback album ever in A Brave New World.  The classic lineup in place in addition to Janick Gers on guitar, this CD is a live recording of their festival show in Brazil.  Amazing.  The power and ferocity of the band is ever evident here.  Bruce Dickinson voice is fantastic.  What a range this guy has.  The triple guitar interplay between Dave Murray, Adrian Smith, and Janick Gers is a rhythmic tour de force not to mention excellent guitar solos.  Of course Steve Harris and Nicko McBrain provide the real thrust making you feel like you're being stampeded by a herd of elephants upon listening.  The other cool thing about this CD is the audience, excuse me, the small country, is chanting and screaming in unison throughout and it sends shivers down your spine.  Brave New World tracks are heavily represented, but also crucial classics like Wrathchild, The Trooper, and The Number Of The Beast are included.  I must say I was pleasantly surprised at how good songs like Sign Of The Cross and The Clansman are.  Those two songs were originally recorded during a pretty obscure time in Maiden's history with a replacement singer for the irreplaceable (sp?) Dickinson.  The point is, this is Iron Maiden, and they are one of the best metal bands on the planet.
B00005JKDR|3.0|The movie is great, but the packaging outright lies when it states that it is closed captioned. Only the movie is captioned. This is normal when there is one DVD with a few extras on it, in which case I wouldn't complain (even though I'd be disappointed.) <br />If two DVDs are included in a set, and only one is captioned, then the packaging and resellers should somehow communicate this to prospective buyers. I was really looking forward to the extras--but I can't watch them. I'd have liked to be pre-warned. I never would have bought the set if I had known.
B00006J9OT|5.0|I've been converting friends and family to Jazz for years and have been especially passionate about the music of Diana Krall. Yes, the record company has been pushing her &quot;look&quot; - but it's the talent that makes her what she is. And with this album she has finally gotten back to her roots. Small group: drums, bass, guitar, and Diana at the head of the group on Piano and vocals. The occasional appearance of Orchestration only enhances the performance rather than drag it down (which is what unfortunately happened with Diana's last album). With the crowd behind her, the strong musicians she always associates with, and the tasteful selections of music she chooses, this is a must have for Jazz fans in general, and Diana Krall fans specifically.

B000002J0P|5.0|...It is the best work that these three talented artists did together. (I never was fond of Young's transformation of the group, although D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu has many wonderful moments.)<br />Many comment on how well structured the work is. Love and war are juxtaposed, which lends a dynamic feel to the whole. Love and war are contrasted, but are also similar in that they involve conflict from which the writers wish to escape.<br />The opener, a bit pretentiously named a suite, has nice alliterative phrasing and is beautifully performed. The words might appear not to be important to the overall thematic organization of the album, but the theme is difficult love, in reaction to which the writer wants to escape.<br />\\"Marrakesh Express\\" presents one way to avoid reality, drugs. This breezy song, a rocker with a vaguely Latin beat and instrumentation, is pure escapism.<br />\\"Guinnevere\\" is corny, but it is another masterfully performed piece, and the images evoked of idyllic moments in some vaguely defined innocent past are very effectively presented. The idealized, non-existent past is an alternative to the problematic love of the first piece, but there is also an allusion to freedom, which foreshadows the call to action in protest of war.<br />\\"You Don't Have to Cry\\" is a good rocker, again about the conflict of love.<br />The raucous rocker, Pre-Road Downs, is a fun interlude that leads to the amazing \\"Wooden Ships.\\" Jefferson Airplane's version simply doesn't have the same impact in my opinion. There is an interesting political dimension to this song, the idea that human beings should attend to similarities in need, rather than war, which is unwinnable. For those who dodged the draft by moving to Canada or elsewhere, this song can't help but have an impact to this very day. When they admonish the listener to go \\"far away, where we might laugh again,\\"one is reminded of just how dark US history was 30 years ago. We see another kind of escapism in that the warm, peaceful breezes alluded to in \\"Guinnevere\\" reappear here to take us away.<br />\\"Lady of the Island\\" is sweet and lyrical, and a frankly necessary interlude after the heaviness of the previous piece. The contrast between love and war is most apparent here.<br />I still am unsure about the purpose of the alliteration in \\"Helplessly Hoping\\" but the song has the sound of a folk classic that has always been sung, a memorable and crisply harmonized song.<br />\\"Long Time Gone\\" is a nice rocker, real smooth. We are back to the present, an ugly time with \\"something going on that surely won't stand the light of day.\\" What with the current throbbing of the drums of war by another administration, many will hear the call to \\"speak out against the madness\\" and remark on how little has changed in the US over the last 30 years. A lot of us baby-boomers knew what happened and watched the ensuing generation and lots of others conveniently forget it. With regard to the contribution of this song to the overall focus of the record, confrontation with those in power is another option.<br />\\"49 Bye-Byes\\" is a great ending to a great album. The seriousness is left behind for a final love song. The bass on this song is driving, exciting. Love is imperfect, but a desirable alternative to and escape from war.ezes alluded to in \\"Guinnevere\\" reappear here to take us away. <br />\\"Lady of the Island\\" is sweet and lyrical, and a frankly necessary interlude after the heaviness of the previous piece.

0553106635|1.0|It is hard to convey the insanity of the praise for this book. This is NOT a good book. All the characters are asinine and or evil caught in a medieval world of Month Python without a shred of the humor. I am a lifelong fantasy fan and this is simply not a good book. It is NOT at the top of the genre like many people are making it out to be. That sentiment is laughable beyond measure. This book is just plain tedious at times and many of the minor characters are just fill-in fodder. And what have people been reading to praise the dialogue so? This is just plain, simple dialogue, which fits into the story but nothing great, nothing subtle, nothing witty, nothing out of the ordinary. Like the book ok lines once in a while but nothing more. There is not much of philosophy, or delving into the human condition that other fantasy can and does deliver. The world really isn't all that interesting and the lords and the banners and the plotting and honor of the houses, blah, blah after not too long. Yes I had read the first 2, yes I read this in less than 3 weeks, which is a good accomplishment, but I am giving up on the series, the book feels like that much of a betraying of the first 2 books. This is writing by connect the dots folks. There are a couple of interesting characters and a lot of mush. I really question anyone who praises this book, if they have read in the fantasy genre or much at all. Simply a fairly bad book which is a total shame after the first 2 books. Martin, quite simply, lost it. Also the plot rather then being intricate, interesting, and subtle, it is simply large, and pointless. The author clearly has no idea where he is going or why. Danerys and the dragons, the dialogue and characters surrounding it? Pointless, stupid, some of the worse writing you will ever encounter. This book would simply be another bad book, one of the worst I had ever encountered. Given what people think of it however, it is an abomination and almost grotesque given the marvelous fantasy that is out there that can give you insight into the human condition, help you find yourself, give you warmth, cheer, strength, and yes sadness as well. This book if you have any sense in your soul will simply give you a blankness and a sense of having wasted your time. The world has no resemblance to reality. Just as a world that is all lightness and goodness and laudy dah would make you want to gag and give you no insight. A world so blank and banal and mean and pointless where everyone walks around with his or her head cut off (literally and figuratively) is just as stupid and pointless to visit. If you have no insight or taste whatsoever you might think it passable or goodness forbid even good.

0316666343|2.0|When I read the blurb for The Lovely Bones, I had no idea how popular it was.  Then I bought it and read it and have no idea why it's so popular. The plot is an interesting one.  The beginning is very strong and emotional.  Yet beyond the beginning and the promising plot is really just bad writing.  The dialogue alone is laughable and made me(when I wasn't laughing) cringeing at some of the VERY sappy sentiments.  Yes this is an emotional subject matter, but that doesn't excuse lines such as \\"she seasoned her toast with her tears\\" GOD!  Who wrote this, a 16 year old?  This novel reads as though Sebold took a creative writing course and took everything that the hack that taught it told her to write, seriously. If you're interested in how a family copes with the murder of a daughter in a realistic way, I wouldn't say this is the book.  But I'm sure it will be a movie!  Hopefully the screen writer will be better than Sebold!
B00004TH7Z|5.0|People who say this sounds nothing like their old stuff, and can't even hit a key? you are crazy. Best vocals i've heard from Dickinson. Hitting any key imaginable! Perfectly! And ok, WTF is up with that britney spears chick, britney is popular from looks, the only absence there is talent in vocals and dancing. Worst dancer I've ever seen. But anyways, to most iron maiden fans, THIS album, Brave New World, IS one of the best. i Really suggest you should ge tthis, it had drum guitar and vocals that ARE THE BEST!
B00005A0RI|4.0|Este CD ha sido calificado como la mejor produccion del ao. Puede que asi sea, la verdad es un CD muy bello, con un repertorio intimo y suave, con destacadas participaciones de Gonzalo Rubalcaba, David Sanchez y Joe Lovano (inevitable es recordar al duo Getz/Gilberto).  Sin embargo creo que algunos arreglos de violin no fueron bien logrados, llegando a sonar un poco &quot;melosos&quot;.  A excepcion de eso, el CD es un buen regalo para escuchar en un dia como el de San Valentin.
0316666343|5.0|Though no book is perfect, and this one is no exception to that, I enjoyed the way Alice Sebold put the whole story inside the framework of a fantasy, beginning it in heaven. That's what makes &quot;The Lovely Bones&quot; unique. The only other book I read that does that is &quot;West Point...&quot; by Norman Thomas Remick which, take it for what it's worth, I also recommend. But, don't just go by what I say. Get the books. You won't be disappointed.
B000003TA4|5.0|Nirvana's Nevermind sounds so cliche and overplayed today because a million and one bands have ripped off their innovative sound that molded grunge and rock music for the better. The musicianship of the album isn't complicated for the mostpart, as \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" and \\"Come As You Are\\" are typical songs for the early guitarist, but the song writing and arrangements are so well done that the need for anything profound and complex is immediately thrown out. Nirvana was a band who were great at what they did, needing only their honesty and emotion to get them across, not flashy 80's solos and glam attire.<br />Kurt Cobain's guitar work, as stated, was not complex, but was interesting, new, innovative, creative, and original, as he was one of the first artists to begin using the rhythm guitar to lead the melody without the choppy leads of 80's hair metal. His chord progressions are simple and basic for a large portion of the album, but throughout the entire recording his technique stays true to form, using original flowing riffs to carry the song when he does use his instrument as a lead. Kurt Cobain's guitar style has essentially motivated and shaped how the instrument has been used since 1991 and almost all of rock's song writing processes today. In equal impressiveness alongside his guitar skill are Cobain's lyrics and his vocal stylings, which always have an underwritten sense of urgency and need in them, supporting the hurt heard in his voice. Although he did not possess one of the greatest voices in music, and still does not, he used his singing well with the music, fitting the musicianship and instrumentation perfectly.<br />Chris Novoselic's bass lines are upbeat, catchy, and just as sincere as Kurt's guitar playing, his instrument carrying a melody all of its own instead of just following the bass drum and staying in the background, once again breaking away from the rock and metal stylings of the previous decade.  Truly standout. Alongside him on the rhythm is Dave Grohl, who should've stuck with the drums instead of moving onto fronting the Foo Fighters in later years and taking up guitar duties. His drumming is solid and top notch on Nevermind, showing him at his best on the instrument he shines with.<br />Standout tracks in addition to the first six, all of which were hit singles, are \\"On A Plain\\" and \\"Something In The Way\\"'s acoustic strummings. One of the greatest albums of the 90's. You may think Nirvana is getting a bit old now and the sound too cliche, but try to listen from a perspective when all this was new to the scene and you will feel the truly groundbreaking effect on you it was meant to have.
B000002A3T|4.0|...because I sense this album gets &quot;no respect,&quot; certainly if you're to judge by the official review up there. Fisrt, I didn't think A MOMENTARY LAPSE OF REASON deserved the trashing it got. But this album really is nice. You can argue whether it's Floyd, but when Gilmour's singing it sounds like, well, a David Gilmour-vocals Pink Floyd song. And the songs ARE well written, and that DOES mean lyrically and, above all, melodically. I don't know of a more consistent record, either. It envelopes you in a somewhat cottony journey, with very good and very trademark guitar solos throughout. Rick Wright contributes a song or two that are quite on the mark. This is almost a too &quot;mature&quot; album in theme, though, and if you rely on the great tunes and play it too many times in a row it's gonna sound a tad moralistic...or something. It's very &quot;heavy.&quot; But you know it has longevity, too, and should rightfully go down as the best work Gilmour has done alone since &quot;The Narrow Way,&quot; of course an atogether different piece. He was always the Heart of Pink Floyd, and now he's simply gone further in the direction of taking Waters' place as its mind also.
B000063K2W|5.0|Probably the best movie comedy there is because it is absolutely One-Of-A-Kind. An all female cast in a movie about females in the Female Jungle. Hence the catch-phrase \\"jungle red\\" for the hot new nail color at Sydney's--the swank salon for the trendiest females--\\"jungle red\\" is the color of blood. And the \\"blood\\" flies with the fur as these gals rip each other to shreds. Unbeatable cast of pros, costumes (including a color fashion show that must be seen to be believed) and George Cukor at the helm make for one-helluva good show. The DVD is first-rate from Warner Bros. But it's the ladies that provide the entertainment here. Riotous script by Anita Loos & Jane Murfin from the Broadway play by Clare Booth Luce have the girls literally bouncing off the walls with catty dialogue and sniping about everything. A MUST see for film lovers and Rosalind Russell and Crawford fans. Only Norma Shearer hits a false note as Mary the wife done wrong. Her performance is badly dated and very stylized. But actually, it just brings the film up from \\"camp\\" to \\"high camp\\" so why quibble...note the final shot to see what I mean. Hell, this must have been camp in 1939! Just pop this in, sit back and see what acting is all about. A genuine classic and a much beloved American film on all counts.
006016848X|5.0|This book clearly explains what women need to understand about men to keep them in love with you and vise versa. It explains that you need to give the opposite sex what it needs not what you want them to have. I was amazed by how my incorrect interpretation of things in my 4 year marriage made so many matters unnecessarily frustrating. I have also been shocked by the positive response my husband has shown to my use of these methods. He is picking up his socks, he is taking out the trash, he is talking to me and doing it gladly because I now know how to ask and how to respond to make him want to. My eyes have been opened to how deeply he already loved me without me being able to appreciate it. Don't listen to the naysaying reviews.  This book is full of truth even if it isn't politically correct.
0783228457|5.0|I saw this on it's release in 1983 and whew!. Here's another good reason why some movies should not be seen under the influence of anything. I never forgot it and grabbed it on video later and then DVD. It's my personal favorite of Cronenberg's films. TV becomes a living breathing organism on it's own and cable TV pirate Max Wren (an excellent James Woods) experiences this when he tries to follow sexy talk-radio host Debbie Harry into the other world of \\"Videodrome\\"---a violent underground cable TV reality show like no other that has a strange hypnotic power. He manages to track down it's source and discovers the ultimate takeover using the \\"new flesh\\". Incredible special effects and in one scene \\"hand gun\\" takes on an all new meaning. Just watch it and judge for yourself but be aware this is an intense and graphic film.  Fascinating viewing and absolutely bizarre....it's a definite cult item. Highly recommended.
B00006J9OT|5.0|The music is as usual excellent, BUT, there are only 3 different ones that aren't on her other albums that we have.  We should have looked more closely.  The songs are longer and with more instrumentals.  Before you buy, check your other albums unless you don't care about  repeats.
0316666343|3.0|This book has been so hyped this year that I was dying (pardon the phrase) to read it. When it finally came in at my library, I started reading it that night. The first 80 pages or so are indeed gripping, but then they begin flashing forward by months and years at a time, and it feels rushed. So it's good, but not quite worth the hype.
B00005OAIE|5.0|My friends are getting sick of hearing about it, so are my colleagues.  I've been playing this CD non-stop since I bought it and have since recommended it to all of my friends.  His lyrics are insightful and mature, his guitar licks are contagious, his melodies are infectious.  &quot;City Love&quot; moved me to tears, even though it's not a sad song.<br />He subscribes to the Dave Matthews method of marketing which is to allow his fans to tape his shows.  He is also a fan of MP3 websites, describing them as the mix tape of the new millenium.  I bought his CD because his talent amazes me and he deserves my money.  You should do the same if you're so moved.
B00005JGI6|5.0|For anyone who's been paying attention knows that &quot;invisible&quot; is the last thing they have been lately, earning a massive acclain and a Brit 'home land' Award for last year's single &quot;The Man Who&quot;. Anyway, they did had a good timing to coincide &quot;The invisible band&quot; album's release with their North American tour which began this month (June '01).<br />&quot;Sing&quot; is definitely a standout track and after it's soaring and banjo-scibbled rocker appeal, you would find yourself &quot;sing, sing, singing&quot; to this tune all day long. Softrocking tunes like &quot;side&quot; and &quot;pipe dreams&quot; are totally stuffed with instrumentals and touchy feely vocals with a subtle blending of accoustic strums and electric lead lines. The new songs 'Flowers In The Window', 'Safe' and 'Dear Diary' are very passionate and powerful ballads which are simple yet melancholy melodious with perfect playing despite unimpressive sound. &quot;The Cage&quot; is classic Travis melody with great vocals on a hounting chorus. &quot;flowers in the Window&quot; is a end to end love-song while seagulls caw and oceans splash in the back.<br />All in all, Travis is again giving out the same sound which drew fans to Radiohead. And, I kinda see them as a shadow band for Radiohead. But the difference to note here is that Radiohead albums are more intense and require repeated listening while Travis's pop-rock approach is very visible. They have figured a way to get some Radiohead fans, plus more with a catchy appeal and adventurous art in their albums.
B00006HBUA|5.0|...for all the people who really want to see this movie I recommend it. When I went to see it, I did it only in protest. My son is a huge Scooby fan, and I had to take him. I went with the expectation that I was actually going to hate it. I mean only two weeks before I had seen the preview and I thought it looked stupid. Well in I go with a puss on my face, out I came with tears of laughter from my eyes. My son and I were the loudest ones laughing, that's how much I enjoyed it. I can't wait for the DVD to come out, my son is counting the days as I write. It was cute, funny and touching. One movie that I am happy to say I will let my son watch over and over. If your a Scooby Doo fan I don't think you will be disappointed.

B00005JKQZ|2.0|Well, it appears that this film made enough academy members weep and decide finally to throw an Oscar Ron Howard's way (which he truly has deserved in the past), but this film is not nearly as remarkable or memorable as these awards would suggest.  [Just read what the serious reviewers had to say at rottentomatoes.]<br />In addition to the fact that it is in essence a &quot;fictionalization&quot; of Nash's life, I found the film uneven and, gasp, even boring!  And what's worse, much to my friends' horror, I found I didn't even care about the John Nash portrayed in the film.  As portrayed he is certainly a tragic figure, but despite Howard's often over-wrought style, Crowe's Nash is not particularly noble, courageous or even likable.  I didn't feel much if anything for this man, but I know that I'm supposed to like him because that's Russell Crowe up there on the screen and that's Ron Howard directing him.  Well, rather than swallow this bland bait, I'd rather watch something meaningful.  I guess that's why I'm not an academy voter...<br />If you want to watch this as a work of fiction, and you can stomach the manipulative tenor of Howard's direction, I guess you'll like &quot;A Beautiful Mind.&quot;  If, however, you care about legitimate portrayals of historical figures, and you'd rather not have the director play on your emotions without any real substance to back it up, don't bother.  There are scores of films that are much more beautiful out there.
B00006G8LB|3.0|Ok, Spider-Man was named the summer blockbuster for 2002 and it was a great movie and more than $400 million- but does that mean it was better than Star Wars Episode II- Attack of the Clones?<br />Not a chance.<br />Spider-Man was ruined by William Dafoe as the green goblin.  Sure, the visual effects in spider-man were compelling but it was not better than Attack of the Clones.<br />Spider-Man was predictable and basically a glorified verison of the cartoon.<br />If you want to see real action and adventure- see Lord of the Rings or Attack of the Clones- both are better than Spider-Man.
0553275976|4.0|Tom Wolfe is a great writer. He uses language beautifully, develops characters extremely well, and creates good drama. I would, however, say that he is a better essayist than novelist and I would recommend The Right Stuff or The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test over this book because they are more focussed and he keeps his story together better in them. With that said though, I would highly recommend Bonfire of the Vanities. Wolfe describes the socialites, lowlifes, politicians, reporters, and other various characters who populate the New York scene and all of their particular vanities in great detail. They are believable, whether they are likable or not is really besides the point, and they come to life with their authentic dialogue and charater flaws. It is a satirical book written by a very observant author, so even those who have not been exposed to this culture is able to become caught up in it and find themselves fascinated by the whole scene. I would recommend this book to anyone who like social critiques, interesting characters, good writing, and a fast paced story.
B00005LOUQ|1.0|...Folks, I wish I were a better scribe so that I could just tell you how [bad]this movie is. I'll just sum up the plot a bit: the Grinch is the good guy and the Whos down in Whoville are the bad guys who love the commercialization of Christmas. Oh, and isn't that Who wife-swapping party a nice touch in a family picture?<br />That sound you hear is Dr. Seuss spinning in his grave...
B00003CX9E|5.0|I think its an insult to say that Citizen Kane was one of the worst movies ever made.  It is still quite an awesome achievement-cinematography, editing, art design are wonderful.  I think everyone should watch it at least once, even if you hate it afterwards, you'll still remember it.  That's what Citizen Kane really is I guess, an impression, an experience-timeless.
0312958455|4.0|...is he doesn't know when to stop being such a hard-boiled contrary son of a gun.  Even though that's the whole premise behind Harry Bosch, his flagrant disregard for his superiors and for the badge he wears sometimes makes him infuriating.  But, heck, what the heck...this is a darned good entry in the Bosch series.  It has a lot of haunting imagery and his dealings with the murder of his prostitute mother bring out a very poignant and sensitive side of Harry that he is too willing to hide.  Poor Harry...once again, he is \\"suspended\\" because he put Harvey Pounds (you'll remember him from the previous novels) head through his glass window.  Now undergoing psychiatric evaluation by a very understanding female psychiatrist, Harry decides to take his off time and investigate the 30 year old murder of his mother.  No one ever solved it, and of course you know that Harry will dig deep to find out who did it and why.  This one has plenty of surprises, including some deaths you won't believe happened, and a real twist at the end.  Women may pick up on the hidden clue better than men, as we tend not to worry about how we're dressed.  Anyway, I have to agree with a previous reviewer who found Harry's terminated romance with Sylvia somewhat disappointing.  Seemed like in the \\"Concrete Blonde,\\" Harry and Sylvia were at a reconciliation point, and now she's gone off to Venice.  What happened, Michael?  And now Harry's involved with a woman named Jazz, and he's head over heels in love with her, but I gather from the previous review, she's not mentioned in Bosch's next novel.  What gives, Michael?  Getting Harry into bed is not a requirement of these novel's excellence.  It tends to weaken Harry rather than strengthen him.  Hopefully, as I go through the series, some of these questions will be resolved.  If not, so be it.  It's still a compelling read and one that adds credence to the continuous of the Bosch series.<br />RECOMMENDED.
B00005NWM3|2.0|My first empression when listening was simply this.  Same song, different lyrics.  Almost all of these songs run the same sort of musical pattern, one that is predictable, and not at all original or groundbreaking.  The lyrics are basically sad ramblings, and in no way are close to the wording quality of Stainds lyrics.  After saying that, I will say this.  Though they do nothing new.  Do not show any &quot;musical quality&quot; besides easy drum loops, and catchy, simple chords on the guitars, ect.  They do their genre well.  Its been done before, and probibly will be done again.  But if your looking for a &quot;been there heard that&quot; veiw on rock albums, they do it well.  All this with one exception.  I really do like the last track (reason for 2 stars instead of 1)  The last track has an awesome guitar sound, one that is not used in this genre of music to much, so is in a way &quot;groundbreaking&quot;  IN SUMMARY.  They play nothing new, but they play the old decently.  Their lyrics are not thought provoking in the least.  Will prolly get close to 10 or 15 spins before boredom sets in.  (cept for the last track)
B000000OF6|3.0|This 2-disc set compiles the original British versions of &quot;Greatest Hits I &amp; II&quot;.  You do get some songs on here that aren't on the American versions (&quot;Greatest Hits&quot; &amp; &quot;Classic Queen&quot;) like &quot;Breakthru&quot;, &quot;The Invisible Man&quot;, &quot;Innuendo&quot;, &quot;It's A Hard Life&quot;, &quot;Flash's Theme&quot; and &quot;Friends Will Be Friends&quot;.  But chances are you aren't familiar with most of those songs, most of which are from Queen's synth-happy 80's period.  The American versions include &quot;Keep Yourself Alive&quot;, &quot;Stone Cold Crazy&quot;, &quot;Tie Your Mother Down&quot;, and &quot;Body Language&quot; all songs that were semi-popular on this side of the pond, and all of which (except &quot;Body Language&quot;) are extracted from Queen's more rocking golden years of 1973-1980.  Together, &quot;Classic Queen&quot; and &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; represent the ultimate Queen collection.  If you'd rather explore the songs that were more popular from Tony Blair's point of view, by all means get this (I will admit, the songs on GH I &amp; II are sequenced more chronologically then they are on the haphazardly-presented American versions).
B00006AFUR|5.0|30 Seconds to Mars' debut self-titled album is truly one of a kind. The alternative rock band gets their point across in every song through Jared Leto's rock-star voice and almost even poetic lyrics. I would definitely recommend this CD to anyone who likes alternative music - the musicianship on this album is awesome. If I could, I would give it a million stars... :-)
B00006IM9Q|5.0|Super CD collection of great tunes from Blondie, which have hardly aged at all.  Highly recommend this CD to all.  Hope it sells by the truckloads.  CD is lacking the promised two extra new tracks, which would have helped with sales.  Old record company still profiting from Blondie.  However, the Blondies get a bigger share this time due to renegotiations.  Can't wait for their new CD in early 2003.

B000066NW0|5.0|I Love this CD! I don't think anyone really cares if she's punk because she has great, down-to-the-point music. Simple as that. My favorite song is I'm with you, which is slow but awesome! You should really get this CD, it's great!
B00005QIPH|2.0|I think I echo a few reviewers when I say that I was drawn in by &quot;Last Nite&quot; which is admittedly catchy.  Or maybe it was only noteworthy because at the time, it was just about the only song on the radio that wasn't rap metal and therefore was a nice change of pace.  So after reading the ejaculations and exaltations on this site that claimed the strokes to be &quot;the saviours of rock and roll&quot; I figured I'd go buy it.<br />i've got to stop buying CDs on the strength of one song.<br />&quot;Last Nite&quot; gets old fast and there really isn't that much difference in the arragnements between that song and every other song on the CD.  It just seems like variations of the same thing: a bar chord or two strummed very quickly over a minimalist back beat with Casablancas' lazy delivery filling out the sound.  Fine if you like that sort of thing.  I've yet to listen to the whole CD because I get so fed up after the 3rd or 4th song that I have to turn it off.  I keep trying to listen, to maybe even let it grow on me, to really give it a chance before condeming it but I can't.<br />They may be a bit (at best) like the Velvet Underground but how long has it been since anyone honestly had anything new to say about them?
B000001EGA|5.0|you gotta listen to this album, of course. He did so many thinks that no one else has even dared to try and succeeded its amazing. Recording a purely autobiographical album and then seeing it become a hit is some accomplishment.<br />I can remember buying it the first day it came out. I used to have the Billboard magazine showing it number one and gold the first week of release.<br />This is a sad album for me in some ways because it marked the beginning of the end for the old, edgy, razor sharp Elton. And, it was his last album that was good from beginning to end.<br />If you can find the old vinyl with all of the inserts, get it and treasure it! I have one.

B000001DQI|5.0|Never. This album is the high-water mark of Elton's career. Sure, he sold tons of albums after this, but this brought everything together. He still had an edge on this album that declined in the next two and disappeared after &quot;Rock of the Westies.&quot;<br />The range of themes and musical styles is amazing. I can't think of any other album ever that attempted this kind of mix and succeeded. <br />This is an amazing rock/pop album. There is not a bad song in the bunch. <br />There is a new DVD on the making of GBYBR that you need to get if you want to to know something more about this album.<br />So excuse me, its seven o'clock and I wanna rock...
B00006G8K0|3.0|Can't say anything about the actual film contents and style that hasn't been said before: Christopher Lee IS the Count to me and always will be. That being said, I'm saddened by the fact that Warner was the distributor of this film. While, yes, the movie is 44 years old, I found the picture to be grainy and the mono sound? Don't get me started. Why is it that a movie like _Scars of Dracula_ on Anchor Bay is a 2 disc set and at least looks really good, and _HOD_ is treated this way with amateurish special features?! The only reason I bought this movie was for what it is, and so that hopefully one day Warner may realize that there was enough support for the DVD to warrant a re-release that does this great film justice.
B00005QIPH|5.0|It was so nie for a chnge to buy a CD on which every single song is well, a single.  I've been listening to this album CONSANTLY for months!  Seriously, it's great!

B00003CWPL|5.0|Existentialist philosophers like Derrida and Heidegger talked about a repeated theme, that humans have been \\"thrown\\" into a world where the most absurd things can happen, and that humans must create meaning (if there is any at all) from the absurdity and react to it, if possible.  \\"Eraserhead,\\" David Lynch's first feature-length film, explores this notion to its absolute extreme.  Many other Lynch films deal with the idea of ordinary people put into extraordinary circumstances, but in \\"Eraserhead\\" it is the overriding concept of the entire movie, and one that Lynch has teased to its grisly, beautiful perfection.<br />Set in a retro-future reminiscent of Lang's \\"Metropolis\\" or the worst parts of the Victorian era mingled with a post-nuclear environment, \\"Eraserhead\\" follows the perpetually-frizzy-haired Henry Spencer as he learns that his girlfriend is pregnant and is forced to marry her at her parent's request (at a dinner where the roast chickens splay themselves suggestively on the dinner table, no less).  Henry wears a look of almost constant bewilderment at having been put in this position, but it is nothing compared with the outlandishness of the rest of the movie.  Henry's apartment building appears to be abandoned, and the lights flicker on and off uncontrollably, while the woman across the hall gives him phone messages from a payphone, and the woman who lives in his radiator tells him (in song) that \\"In heaven, everything is fine.\\"  When Henry and Mary pick the baby up from the hospital, he discovers that, whatever it IS, it most certainly is NOT human.<br />Lynch has always concerned himself with bipolar contrasts, and \\"Eraserhead\\" is no exception.  While Henry pines for Heaven, it is unclear whether he is living in Hell, or simply a world gone horribly wrong.  For all the repeated imagery of copulation, reproduction, and birth, coupled with violence, it could be either, although it is clear that everything that happens is within the realm of possibility, making the latter more probable.  The film is interspersed with postmodern artistic scenes evoking violence, life, and death, and there is little conventional \\"plot\\" to speak of - simply Henry reacting to the increasingly absurd, which he never gets used to nor ever fully accepts.<br />So what is Lynch trying to do or say?  I have my suspicions, but to talk about \\"meaning\\" before the experience would ruin the whole thing.  Let's put it this way: just as Henry sits there slack-jawed and glassy-eyed at what's going on around him, so too is the audience supposed to do the same - it may be one of the best tricks any artist has ever played on his viewers.<br />All in all, \\"Eraserhead\\" will not be to everyone's tastes.  In fact, I doubt it would even appeal to those who liked other Lynch movies such as \\"Mulholland Drive\\" or \\"Blue Velvet.\\"  It is much more an art film, but you're the kind of person who goes to movies to escape, you might want to pass on \\"Eraserhead.\\"  If you like to think, especially on the existential level, see what you can make of it.<br />Final Grade: Aaking the latter more probable.

B000062YAZ|5.0|Slayer's \\"Reign in Blood\\" is easily the most intense and aggressive musical onslaught one could subject themselves to. The guitars and drums attack with inhuman ferocity. From a musician's view, the incredibly precise and technical playing adds even more intensity to an already venomous release. Listening, one can hear the massive effort Slayer put in to this release, with every track fitting perfectly.  The overall atmosphere is darker than pitch. This is a CD that you can't stop listening to. It is MANDATORY that you listen to the entire disc, from \\"Angel of Death\\" to \\"Raining Blood.\\" The bonus tracks are not necessary, but are quite good nonetheless. One minor problem I have is the lack of bass guitar sound.  The guitars and drums completely snuff it out.  Don't get me wrong, the guitar and drums are terrific, but Tom Araya is a very underrated bassist and deserves to be heard. However, despite this minor flaw, I enjoy every single song here. It is impossible to choose only a few. I listen to a wide variety of heavy music, from power metal to old-school punk to black metal, not to mention some jazz, classical, electronic, and classic rock of many sorts, and I have found nothing this intense in any genre. Any fan of metal, or good music of any form or fashion, would be very well-advised to pick this disc up. Metalheads do not deserve the term \\"metalhead\\" until this is placed in their collection. It is MANDATORY!!<br />Up the Irons!!
1573226521|5.0|Alex Garland's debut novel, \\"The Beach,\\" is possibly one of the strongest first books from a writer in the 1990s.  Published in 1996, it combines a psychological thriller, a travel story, and a portrait of why young people decide to leave home for months on end and travel around the world.  While any and all of these themes could become (and have become, in other books) clich&eacute; in a matter of pages, it is a testament to Garland's skill as a writer and as a thinker that he manages to create a book that rises above stereotypes and actually concerns itself with the characters involved, and their real-world counterparts.<br />Richard is a British student who packs his backpack and heads to Thailand, looking for adventure.  His head full of Vietnam-era stories of war and post-Vietnam era stories of untouched paradises that lie just around the next corner, he finds Thailand to be simply an extension of the overcommercialized world he left behind.  When a suicidal maniac in the hotel room next door leaves Richard a map to a beach rumored to be like Eden, he sets off with a pair of French lovers to find out if the stories are true.<br />What he discovers is a place with natural beauty, but with a society of backpackers who, like himself, are trying to escape civilization for as long as possible.  He fits in with Beach culture, but the relative isolation and his conflicts with one of the other residents eventually lead Richard to take up residence more in his mind than in the real world.  When things start to fall apart, partially because of forces Richard helped create, he struggles to hold on not only to his life, but his sanity.<br />People have compared \\"The Beach\\" to other survival-style novels like \\"Lord of the Flies,\\" and accuse it of being many things it is not.  Both are unfair.  The people at The Beach are really little more than a bunch of potsmoking rich kids whose main forms of recreation include playing the Gameboy and smoking marijuana: that is precisely Garland's point, and it is, in a way, an indictment of both the backpacker culture in general and the optimism of youth that leads kids of that age to seek utopia without leaving the civilization they claim to hate.  Garland is fully aware of the contradiction, and this is one of this main points, and one he does not shy away from.  Although many fans of the book did not like the movie, one of the things the film portrayed accurately was Richard's enormously skewed point of view: he sees the world as a place to be compared with video games and movies, because that's really all he knows.  He's a character that the reader is not supposed to like.  It makes him no less responsible for what happens, but it's an interesting look into the psychology not only behind the traveler/backpacker culture, but into the general disaffection of world youth.  Why, when we are promised that things are supposed to be a certain way, do they not turn out such?<br />Garland weaves a fantastic book with \\"The Beach,\\" and its gentle meanderings, gut-wrenching tension, and ferocious violence are worth a read or two.  Here's hoping Garland's new screenplay, \\"28 Days Later...\\", is as interesting.<br />Final Grade: A-nd's point, and it is, in a way, an indictment of both the backpacker culture in general and the optimism of youth that leads kids of that age to seek utopia without leaving the civilization they claim to hate.

B00005QAPH|5.0|If you have ever wondered what all the fuss was about regarding director Fellini & leading man, alter-ego Mastroianni, this film will resolve any doubts.  It is a superb autobiographical look at Fellini (played wonderfully by Mastroianni) by Fellini.  He sugarcoats nothing so it is a complete portrait of the artist, the man, the filmmaker.  It is peopled by the many distinctive faces that would be called Felliniesque in later years plus is shot in surreal, dreamy black and white.<br /><br />Perhaps the most complex issue is the role of women in his life plus its related issue of family.  Those hugely influenced his filmmaking even though most viewers associate him with much more avant garde issues. This film later influenced Woody Allen in making his autobiographical \\"Stardust Memories\\" and Bob Fosse in making \\"All That Jazz.\\"  The word that comes to mind about all 3 films is \\"unflinching.\\"  There is a companion film to this one that I like as well or even better, Fellini's \\"City of Women,\\" also starring Mastroianni.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B00006J9OT|5.0|I was little disappointed in the most recent studio recording that Diana made -- but this IS like hearing her live in concert. Diana's voice gets a little ragged toward the end of the concert, but the back-up swings! Give it a listen. Just The Way You Are is fabulous. Gotta love her. I think she is more than just a pretty face.
B00005JKNF|4.0|This is an early 20th century English country house murder mystery.  It is probably the last vehicle I would have ever imagined Altman interested in making as a film.  I prefer his edgier work, such as the bitingly black comedy, \\"The Player.\\"  However, Altman doesn't make bad movies and that is true here.  It is an ensemble piece, which is true of most of his work.  Everyone in it does a fine job and some of my favorite actors are here.  Scott-Thomas as the wife-aristocrat who loves the life but can barely stand her older, titled husband is just this side of total acid scorn laced with civility.<br /><br />Maggie Smith does another droll turn as the poor relative who is a worse snob and more difficult than anyone else present.  The wonderful Clive Owen is a pivotal character who increasingly piques our curiousity.  Helen Mirren seems totally unsympathetic at first but we do come to understand her character. She renders a well nuanced performance of a complex character.  Most astonishing, Jeremy Northam is an excellent singer and does a marvelous turn entertaining the house guests.  All in all, well done and entertaining, but not among my legion of absolute favorite Altman films.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B00005JKJA|1.0|I read the glowing reviews about this movie, I remember David Lynch's other works (\\"Twin Peaks\\", \\"Blue Velvet\\" and \\"Wild at Heart\\"), and since I grew up in L.A. just off Mulholland Drive, I bought the DVD despite my personal rule of never buying a DVD without seeing the movie first. **HUGE MISTAKE!**  While this film may be very artsy, the story is disjointed and just plain wierd.  Yes, I 'got it' - the plot is basically a dream sequence.  I feel like I wasted not only the money I spent on the DVD, but -more importantly- 2.5 hours of my life watching it. I have since sold this DVD. In my humble opinion, this is an awful, terrible movie. It is a complete waste of time and money. Don't bother.
B00003CXC6|5.0|One fact that isn't well known is that artists seized on this film, in the 1950s, as the most outstanding visual representation of perspective and point-of-view ever represented in the arts. Arguments raged in intellectual and arts circles about whether artists in every medium needed to address these two issues as well as Kurosowa did.  No one argues about that any longer but it is fair to say that any art work that deals with those issues was influenced by this film. The initial set-up is very simple.<br /><br />A woman is raped and her husband is murdered.  Four different characters then give their versions of what happened.  Each believes in the total accuracy of his or her version but the differences from 4 sets of eyes and ears are remarkable to behold. Japanese filmmaking was unknown in America until this film opened and in the ensuing decades we have been exposed to the high art that exists in virtually every artistic medium in Japan.  I certainly have learned an enormous amount of art just by exposure to Japanese art without ever having set foot in the country itself.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

0380789019|5.0|Mr. Gaiman really did a great job on this book. Offers smooth reading, with no chapters that you have to struggle to finish. Set in a very imaginative world, a place where dreams, nightmares and words make sense. A dark fairytale place within London.<br />Very well thought characters and enjoyable story. It figures high in my recommended list! If you haven't read it yet, and if you like some kind of different way to see the world, go for it! You won't regret it!
B00005J6SZ|5.0|I still remember getting upset in early 1985 when Casey Kasem announced that &quot;Like A Virgin&quot; was booted off the top of the billboard charts after 5 weeks by &quot;I Want to Know What Love Is&quot; by Foreigner.  Kind of ironic that I love that Foreigner song now, but when you're 10 years old and Madonna is the cat's meow, anybody that comes near her is dead meat.  Her video's for &quot;Like A Virgin&quot; and &quot;Material Girl&quot; are engraved in my brain for all eternity. They were colorful and fun to watch.  <br />Other songs on here such as &quot;Over and Over&quot; and &quot;Angel&quot; still bring back vivid memories of mid-80's pre-pre-pubescent life.  &quot;Shoo-Bee-Do&quot; is a wonderful song that has not lost it's touch after 18 years.<br />The only songs that annoy me and always did are &quot;Pretender&quot; and &quot;Stay&quot;. Not BAD songs, just not good songs either.
B000002C1W|1.0|Okay people listen here. Anyone who has ever listened to Pink Floyd before Roger  Waters left will know that their music was written to move, inspire, and enlighten the people listening to it. If you read who has written the lyrics on the Floyd albums you will see the name Roger Waters. Take a look now at the names on the so called new pink floyd albums. Those people aren't even in the band. Gilmour had to call people to get lyrics from them.I think that takes away all Pink Floyd has ever stood for. Their music ws pure and attracted a vast majority of people. Now their music is basic and blends with everything else which makes it boring and bland. They needed a strong lyrical force, and that person being Roger Waters was missing. What makes me even madder isthe fact that pink floyd still plays songs written by Roger even though they have no idea what the lyrics mean. The Wall was partially an autbiographical experience in Rogers life and Gilmour not liking him so much had no right to sing those songs as his own. Well thanks for listening and buy some quality Floyd music
B00005QG9J|5.0|There is not one song on this cd that isn't amazing. Sure, this album is softer sounding than their others, but they have expanded in a good way. If you like listening to insightful lyrics, a unique sounding vocalist, outstanding guitar and bass playing, powerful drums, creative producing, plus a talented dj, Morning View is the cd for you. I like it because it has a good feel to it and is not at all clich. This cd will put you in a good mood and is a break from all that harsh sounding rock. It will take you on a roller coaster; each song is different unlike some other band's songs that all sound the same. Well what more can I say? I admire the band for keeping true to themselves and for INTELLIGENTLY written lyrics and all around extraordinarily beautiful music.
0684833395|5.0|This is not a work of fiction but the pure essence of reality.  If you've ever been a part of a private sector organization (business), the military bureaucracy, or any federal, state of local governmental agency, then you have some, most, or all of the characteristics of some of the lunatics in this book.  Which one(s) depends on who you, in your true self, really are.  War is the setting, but this book is based on human organizational psychology.  Yossarian was the lone sane person in this story, which is usually the case in real-life.
B00000ADG2|1.0|This, like most rap, is cliche drivel. It is \\"audio entertainment\\" for people who either 1) don't like actual music 2)who don't know better. Very unlikely to stand the test of time. The hype and gushing surrounding this CD is almost unbelievable until you think \\"Hey, people liked Milli Vanilli for a while too.\\" Trendy garbage.

0553106635|5.0|George RR Martin has done it again in A STORM OF SWORDS. Here we have yet another brilliant addition to the &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; series. Everything present in &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; and &quot;A Clash of Kings&quot; once again makes a showing. The characters continue to develop new dimensions and the plot twists and turns and results in unexpected but still logical conclusions. Martin's direct and hold-nothing-back style of writing remains just as moving and effective as in the first two books. <br />If you have read &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; and &quot;A Clash of Kings&quot; already, then I probably don't even need to tell you to buy this. Do so. You will not be disappointed a bit. That is, at least until the part where you have to put A STORM OF SWORDS down...
B00005B6NC|4.0|I've been hearing lots of comments about this movie from friends of mine, so I finally decided to buy it.  Lemme tell ya, it was worth every penny!  Vin Diesel was absolutely wonderful as Riddick, the convicted murderer whose ability to see the planet's indigenous, man-eating lifeforms proves to be most helpful in getting the crash survivors around in the dark, and Radha Mitchell was great as Caroline, the surviving officer of the crashed ship ... Riddick .. escapes with (the) survivors.  It was also wonderful to see Keith David of Armageddon fame as the Muslim holy man.  I only wish he'd had a bigger role!<br />My only real gripe with Pitch Black (and one, I am sure, that is shared by lots of others everywhere) was the fact that the character played by Farscape's Claudia Black was 86'ed barely halfway through the film.  She was a real tough cookie who seemed to know what she was doing, and it just seemed so senseless that she got offed so early.  Except for that little blunder, I found Pitch Black to be very entertaining, and the behind the scenes documentary to be very informative.
0553328255|5.0|THE COMPLETE SHERLOCK HOLMES is an anthology of every Sherlock Holmes story ever written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. This single volume is an absolute treasure; it reveals to us one of the most influential and powerful characters conceived of in the history of literature. Holmes' many adventures manage to transcend the boundaries of the mystery genre and set their permanent mark on the fabric of Western society. The now cliche \\"Elementary, my dear Watson\\" reveals how both the sheer genius of Holmes and the unwavering loyalty of Watson have been forever integrated into our collective memory.<br />If you have ever read Sherlock Holmes in your life and have enjoyed it, please pick up a copy of this book. Reading it again will merely add to your enjoyment. The astounding revelations and brilliant logic of Holmes never lose their novelty. <br />If you have never read Sherlock Holmes, you have truly missed out on one of the memorable characters in English literature. I urge you to purchase this book immediately. You will not be disappointed.<br />In summary, THE COMPLETE SHERLOCK HOLMES is a must buy for those who do not already own it. I give it my highest recommendation!

B00005JKJA|5.0|&quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; is a haunting and surreal trip through the curvy streets of dreamland, on par with the expressionist masterpiece Das Cabinet de Dr. Caligari and the Dada surrealism of Le Chien Andalou.  Mulholland is not meant to be a movie completely understood but more or less felt, not in an emotional sense, but on a more intellectual level.  Like a dream, Mulholland has many interpretations, and I humbly submit mine.<br />Have you ever had a dream so beautiful and perfect that the dream begins to feel like reality.  May be it is a dream of wealth, may be one of fame, may be one of love lost, found or discovered but never conquered.  Elements of the real world start to blend into those of the dream state until it seems as though the real and the unreal have blended into one.  But it is always in the crescendo of the dream, the estacy, that the dream ends.  There is a point when you are half asleep, half awake, wanting to dream more of your utopian fantasy, but realizing that the dream is lost.  You wake up with an extreme sadness that such a perfect world is not meant for you to possess.  What you are left with is bitter reality.  May be the dream has given you a larger sense of your reality, a brief moment of clarity.  You think about your past, what might have caused you to dream this dream, what is the reality and how can the fantasy be achieved or some fragment salvaged.  But it can also fixate a deeper sense of despair if the reality and fantasy are so far apart that there is no hope for the two to meet, even in the movies.<br />In essence, this is Mulholland Drive.<br />Lynch has always been a master at showing the grimy underbelly of a seemingly perfect world (aka Blue Velvet, Twin Peaks).  There are elements of this in Mulholland Drive, in the constant majestic views of Los Angeles including the Hollywood sign (LA LA Land...the dream factory).  But they are always accompanied by a deep growling soundtrack, full of menance and foreboding.  Back room deals, strange characters or caricatures of Hollwood or underworld figures, they are all here.<br />In a more linear sense, Lynch is critiquing Hollywood, the emotionless, aging, cripple in wheelchair of a town that dictates the next big thing and then chews up and spits out the others.  Hollywood changes not only our realities but also changes the names and faces of those they make into stars and harletts, those they pay to force feed us our fantasies.<br />But in a more cubist sense, Lynch is showing us different views of who we are.  We long for the fantasy, it fulfills something empty in us all.  We are consumed by it.  What are our desires?  What have we achieved?  What do we long to achieve?  What are our desires, our fantasies and how do me meet these or how do we fail?  WHAT IS IT!!  <br />Most people will recall the audition scene, the lesbian scenes, the latin version of Roy Orbison's crying, or the quirky moments of comedy and weirdness that punctuate the film.  But I will be most haunted by the last scene in the film, with that haunting theme music, the two stars alight with innocent delight, the visual embodiment of Gloria Swanson's last line in Sunset Boulevard (where one of our protaganists ends up...or is it starts up)...&quot;I'm ready for my close-up.&quot;  Then, &quot;Silencio.&quot;<br />They are forever in their dream, their unreality together, via that dark, twisty, dangerous road that curves through the hills of Hollywood called Mulholland Drive.

B00004WG4G|5.0|American Beauty is one of the most amazing movies I have ever seen.  Kevin Spacy offers his best performance ever.  In a way the movie portrays a &quot;difunctional family&quot; that deals with issues we seem to forget about.  Annette Benning's character wants the happy home life, but is to caught up in material possesions and social stature.  Lester (Spacy) is the average working father who has nothing to lose.  Lester's outlook on life is amazing.  The movie is absolutly incredible.  It well deserved an Academy Award.  Everything, the soundtrack, dialect, actors and plot, was in perfect unison with each other.  How could anyone not love this movie.
B0000640VO|5.0|What a brilliant film. It captures so many emotions, Longing, Sadness, Joy, Passion and most of all Love. Quite a charming movie with a positive message underlying all the while!! This is a movie that should belong in everyones collection. Undoubtedly you will want to watch over and over. I believe most viewers will be able to relate to one if not more of situations and emotions that Amelie finds herself in. The soundtrack is probably the next item you will want to own because it fits the movie like hand in glove, C'est tres bien!! This movie has it all<br />Humor, Passion, Creative storyline, Music and a Great ending!!<br />And has nothing to do with that it takes place in my favorite city in the world!!!<br />  Enjoy,<br />  Paul R Harrington

B0000399WI|5.0|First off it's simply the greatest movie I have ever seen, literally.  The movie is slow but, dramatic; calm, but powerful; scary, but beautiful; nice, but sad.  Tim Robbins and Morgan Freedman are two of the greatest actors this generation has ever seen.  This was not a commercially made move, has no target audience and just feels like a classic.
0807126071|5.0|I never expected when I began reading this book that I would encounter such a hilarious and original character as Ignatius.  He is similar to Shakespeare's Falstaff, always playing, his language always new.<br />Like Falstaff, Ignatius Reilly is not an admirable character from a moral or social standpoint.  On the contrary he seems a pathetic bum, and a burden on his mother.  His medieval inclinations set him in constant contrast from the world around him.  Does his imagination isolate him from reality?  Or does it allow him to make, in his bizarre, idiosyncratic way, a genuine social criticism of American life?  Perhaps both at once.<br />While he is somewhat disgusting, he is also beautifully interesting in his individuality.  His sparkling humor is mixed with underlying sorrow and helplessness, and one dreads with him the time when he would be finally trapped by \\"reality.\\"  He is very selfish, but somehow at the same time he is a catalyst for change in the stagnant lives of others.<br />The end of this book is not what one would expect, ...  Personally I think the ending is perfect, and as happy an ending as Ignatius could hope for.
0553103547|5.0|It is easy for a fan of fantasy to be drawn to what sets the genre apart from others-the magic, the UNreality. But Martin will remind you that it's not just about the swords and sorcery but creating an entirely new world in itself, something that Tolkien started. It takes more than a unique magic system in a medeival setting to create a new world. It takes great sophistication to have the depth to make it come to life. It takes much more skill to bring the emotions of his characters out as vividly as he does and brings us to his world.<br />This is the beginning of an epic fantasy series so I won't go into the details of the specific story. It has the appropriate complexity of an epic fantasy series and then some! I will say that it is a complete book with a climax and resolution and does a very good job of 'intruduction' to the series very quickly.<br />There are two things that makes him one of my two favorite authors in all of fantasy. The first is that he is ruthless. He is not restrained by any of the rules of a normal fantasy story. I could hardly believe what he was willing to do to tell his story. I love him and I HATE him and I love him for it.<br />The other thing that sets him apart (and I suppose it's the same thing in the end) is his ability to write so fludily and drammatically. It seems to me as if writing ability is not as important in the genre of fantasy than other genres as if the creativity in magic will make up for this failing. Long ramblings and weak books are still snapped up by the fans of fantasy, digested, and lead to the next volume. Martin breaks the norm. There are no weak points in this book (well... the first chapter was a little cheesy, but it actually makes sense, honestly!) and his books only grow more exciting. He has never let me down in writing or in plot.<br />This is the best book in any fictional genre I've read in a very long time and his next two books are just as amazing. If there's any series to be addicted to, this is the one.e one.
0764113496|4.0|As an earlier reviewer quite rightly states, once the rules of verb conjugation are learnt, this books usefulness becomes more of a &quot;lazy persons russian verb conjugator&quot;.<br />However, I still purchased it, primarily because of helping me master conjugation by &quot;visualizing&quot; the tables. Russian Verb conjugation isn't Rocket science, but it's still a pain to learn.<br />If this book consisted of totally irregular verbs it would be extremely useful though and perhaps a better choice for an intermediate russian student.<br />Thus definitely recommended for a beginning serious Russian student but will be outgrown once you gain confidence.

Hollywood has been doing allot of this lately...claiming the DVD is the original uncut movie when in reality the movie was butchered by a crazed editor. It is so sad because the original MASH was so funny. Luckily I have an old VHS copy of the original film.
B00004XOWM|3.0|This was a pretty good album I thought. It had a lot of cool jams on it. However, it seems that Limp Bizkit tried to see if they could use the 'F' word as much as possible! I don't mind swearing in music, but the &quot;2 Hot Dog&quot; song said the 'F' word way too much! I call it the 'F' word song because Limp Bizkit says it atleast 60 times! But the CD is still cool though. I like Korn a little bit better. But songs like &quot;Rollin&quot; and &quot;Getcha Groove On&quot; are my favorite tracks on this CD. Not for all tastes, but good if you like this sort of thing.
B000067DNC|4.0|Stargate SG-1 is one of the best sci-fi series ever created, perhaps even one of the best TV series *Period*. Yes I know it's a bold statement, but it has merit. Season 2 is where the series really starts to take off, and lay ground work for some of the series key storylines. (Thor's Chariot, The Tok'ra, The Fifth Race, etc.) Argueably one of the best seasons, Season 2 packs a startling number of high quality episodes into one short 22 episode season. <br />Quality: 4<BR>     Almost all of the episodes are high quality, must see episodes, and those that are not are at the very least decent.<br />Video: 3 1/2<BR>     Picture quality is great, Wide Screen, very little distortion.<br />Sound: 4<BR>     Boasting Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround sound, these DVDs sound great. Crisp and life-like, the sound is superb.<br />Packaging: 5<BR>     The Box Set comes with a very attractive and useable case, each DVD is seperatly boxed with all of the information you need on the episodes, and more.<br />Special Features: 3<BR>     Perhaps the DVD's biggest weakness, is lack of special features. If Special features are what your in it for, this may not be the box set for you. All DVDs come with Promotional trailers, and 3 of 5 DVDs come with a special featurette on a cast member or Producer.<br />Overall: A Solid 4<BR>     Lack of Special features keep this Box set from getting a perfect 5, other than that this set is very very good, and I reccomend it to ANY SG-1 fan, new or veteran to the series.<br />I can't wait for season 3!!
0316666343|5.0|What a touching story!  I couldn't put it down.
B00000IPAX|1.0|im gonna be short and to the point: this cd completely ruined blink-182 for me...even if they made another record up to par with cheshire cat, i will never like them ever again
6305971099|5.0|i dont know why people constently rag this movie its 100 star entertainment i think this is a great seqeal its very scary i think it was a great idea that jamie loyd had a sycic connection with michal myers i didnt like rache getting killed early  i think they should of waited at least 30 minutes and tina was a great actor i hated that see got killed at the end of the film in the woods see should have survived.
B000002MU3|3.0|R.E.M. tried to return to rock record making once again with this release but with only partial success. After the popish sell out &quot;Out Of Time&quot; and the chamber music of &quot;Automatic For The People&quot; it had been a span of years.<BR>There are some good songs here, most notably &quot;Strange Currencies&quot; but far too often the attempts at heavy grunge style rock are clumsy and awkward.<BR>It was good to see them try again though.
B00005RHGK|3.0|Good looking but strictly average modern day monster film about two nave teens who are on the run from a gargoyle-like creature who needs to eat human body parts to regenerate tissue. Premise is smarter than the usual genre fodder, but an ultimately weak cast and sporadic direction stop this from becoming anything worthwhile. Director Salva obviously had ambition with this horror movie, which is just as uneven as his more adult film POWDER.
B000002LFU|4.0|R.E.M.'s first release on a major label shows the band to be bringing in all it's musical directions for one disc.&quot;Green&quot; was hugely successful, providing the band with it's first #1 single (&quot;Stand&quot;) as well as FM radio hits &quot;Orange Crush&quot; and &quot;Turn You Inside Out&quot;. Other tracks feature the arty scat side of Stipe's lyrics and the dreaded mandolin makes it's appearance felt here on several tracks. <BR>Largely overlooked now for unclear reasons, &quot;Green&quot; can be seen as a transitional release from the rocking, politically charged &quot;Document&quot; to the poppy disaster (but commercially successful) &quot;Out Of Time&quot;.
B0000640SA|3.0|Playing in reverse, an ex-insurance investigator (Guy Pearce) with a case of short-term memory loss tries to find the man who raped and murdered his wife, using bizarre tattoos on his body as guide of his progress. Well made and highly original semi-film noir, but dont pay too much attention to the story otherwise the plot holes really show and there are at least three conclusions. Though it was one of the most popular movies of the year. Theatrical debut for writer/director Nolan who made the 16mm black and white film THE FOLLOWING.
B000002LOE|2.0|The band's commercial breakthrough and artistic lowpoint, OOT takes too many chances, goes in too many directions and comes up short in almost all of them. R.E.M. doing rap is scary indeed. Mike Mills and Bill Berry are great backup singers behind Stipe, but make them lead vocalists and the results are dire.<BR>&quot;Belong&quot; rips off Aerosmith of all bands for it's &quot;Sweet Emotion&quot; style riff. Classical instrumentation abounds to negative effect. and Kate Pearson reaffirms herself as a vocalist best seen and not heard on the tracks where she adds to the clutter.<BR>Only the hit &quot;Losing My Religion&quot; (which is a hands-down classic), the repetative &quot;Low&quot; and &quot;Half A World Away&quot; are up to the usual standard.<BR>Unfortunately, R.E.M. would never be the same again.
B00003CY0V|2.0|Slick and savvy terrorist Travolta recruits ex-computer hacker genius(Hugh Jackman)to transfer billion dollar funds from a forgotten account. This, of course, can't be done without guns and explosions galore. Tiresome action yarn with money to burn takes a mildly intriguing notion and loads it with costly but silly stunt pieces (eg, a city bus being flown around by a helicopter). MATRIX style 360-degree slow-motion track of a hostage explosion at the start of the film is its only highlight. Halle Berry got paid a million to be seen topless for a few seconds.
B000002UW1|4.0|Commercial success comes to R.E.M. instead of the other way around. This is the breakout disc for the band containing their first bona fide hit in &quot;The One I Love&quot;. Like &quot;Life's Rich Pagent&quot;, this contains a mix of the old jangle with the new bombastic sound. The big difference here is that Stipe's vocals are brought way forward in the mix, making them clearly audible for the first time. While the band loses some power and mystique in that move, they break big commercially by it.<BR>The material is up to the usual high standard but some of the chances taken with the added brass and drum machines just plain don't work.<BR>Still, this is where the band's casual fans begin and it's really not a bad place to start.
B00003CXZ1|1.0|Sexy, trigger-happy archaeologist Lara Croft (Angelina Jolie) who likes to excavate tombs in a dare-devil fashion sets on a quest to recover ancient artefacts that have the ability to control time. This is somehow linked to the end of the world...or something. Big, dumb, Indiana Jones wannabe adventure parade (based on the video game) tries to blend confusing and tedious plot with flamboyant action yet typically fails miserably. Silly and no fun at all.
B000002MG1|3.0|Quite possibly R.E.M.'s most overrated offering. Although much better than the sell out &quot;Out Of Time&quot;, Automatic is laden with strings and orchestrations...the group can no longer rock effectively, as tracks like &quot;Ignoreland&quot; and &quot;Sidewinder&quot; can attest to (they are clubfooted and clumsy). They are far more successful on the mid-tempo, jangle tracks...many of which were hits and nearly all became R.E.M. classics. There is great material here (&quot;Find The River&quot; especially) and &quot;Nightswimming&quot; offers up one of the last Stipe scat-like poetic tracks that would be so sorely missed later on.<BR>Overall though, AFTP is a somber, slow paced disc that's far too adult in nature to be totally comfortable with.
B00005JL3A|2.0|Sexy security operative (Jovovich) wakes up one night with amnesia, then gets ambushed by a commando squad and led into an underground research facility over-run by flesh-eating zombies. More entertaining than one would expect from another video-game adaption, but the visual effects are so laughably poor and the concept so ridiculous that most die-hard horror fans will see this to be a direct rip-off of George A. Romeros zombie films. Ten points to anyone who can figure out Jovovichs characters name before the credits.
B000002LOE|2.0|The band's commercial breakthrough and artistic lowpoint, OOT takes too many chances, goes in too many directions and comes up short in almost all of them. R.E.M. doing rap is scary indeed. Mike Mills and Bill Berry are great backup singers behind Stipe, but make them lead vocalists and the results are dire.<BR>&quot;Belong&quot; rips off Aerosmith of all bands for it's &quot;Sweet Emotion&quot; style riff.

B00005JLD2|4.0|Absorbing look at the true story of three aboriginal half-casts who attempted a daring 1500 mile journey across the dangerous desert country of Australia to get home. Gripping all the way with beautiful location photography and great performances from an inexperienced cast. But the cinematography is a noticeable cheat and the children's survival could have been more thorough and better depicted.<BR>Still, the end result is a winning. Notable nods to Keneath Brannagh as the Aboriginal Rights Minister and David Gulpilil is particularly sturdy as the master tracker. One of Noyce's most ambitious films yet.
B000002UVZ|3.0|A transitional release for the band, &quot;Pagent&quot; shows the band's willingness to get commercial..but only in tenative, baby steps.<BR>New producer Don Gehman (John Cougar Melloncamp) does all he can to make the band radio friendly and maintain the air of mystery..hence big time 80's bombastic sound combined with Stipes muffled, almost hidden vocals (the Band's M.O. up to the release of &quot;Document&quot;).<BR>For the very first time, the material isn't up to the usual high standard that made the first three releases outright classics, with a quarter of the songs mearly ok but skimpy and the band's first throwaway (&quot;Underneath The Bunker&quot;) making an appearance. The notion that the band may have been short of material is reaffirmed by some of the songs which date from the band's earliest days (&quot;Just A Touch&quot;).<BR>All in all, it bridges &quot;Fables&quot; and &quot;Document&quot; nicely, but it could've been much better if it had been developed more fully.
B000002BPS|5.0|First, let me start by saying that I am a HUGE Offspring fan.  They are my favorite band, and this is my favorite album (Smash is a close #2 for me).  (Although I am a little ticked that they haven't had anything new in awhile, but I dig &quot;Defy You&quot;).  Ixnay on the Hombre is their most musical album.  There are so many different ideas in one.  The best tracks on this CD are &quot;I Choose,&quot; &quot;Amazed,&quot; &quot;All I Want,&quot; and &quot;Gone Away.&quot;<br />This album has a wide spectrum of Offspring music, songs with a ballad feel (ie: Gone Away), harder rock feel (ie: Amazed), and their traditional punk (ie: I Choose, Cool To Hate).  Plus, the Disclaimer on this CD is the best of all their CDs.  Every song on this album is awesome!  This is a great punk band at their best!
B000002MTU|5.0|I have to disagree with a few of the reviewers who attempt to find fault with Clapton on this CD. As a long-time fan of Clapton, I appreciate both the vocals and guitar work on this CD. Clapton's voice has changed over the years, and as opposed to &quot;growling&quot;, I view it as the voice of a mature rock/blues musician. Hoochie Coochie Man, Someday After Awhile, and It Hurts Me Too are my favorite tracks, but decide for yourself. If you are a fan of Clapton and/or &quot;blues-rock&quot;, I would recommend getting a copy of this CD.
0380789035|5.0|I have to be personal in this one. I read a lot, since I was 5 I read a lot. I prefer history books or books with a &quot;theme&quot;, like detective storys etc. It is very rare that I can get hooked on a book that I do not know where it will lead me. This one does. In forty something years of reading this is the second book that has me reading nonstop trying to figure out what the next page will bring me. It has little to do with the overall story, but mostly the sheer joy every page of it brings. (the book that had me first feel it was &quot;lonesome dove&quot; by Larry Mc Murtry). This guy knows his mithology and mostly he knows how to write in a way that you can almost taste the words, instead of just swallowing them in the haste for the plot.<br />It is a tremendous pleasure for those of us who like the written word<br />As I said, this is a very private feeling and I apologize for those wanting more sensible reviews
B0000046PE|5.0|I was torn when trying to choose my first CD by Ella. If funds had allowed I would have gone for a boxset. Still might save my money for awhile and buy the Complete Songbooks Boxset. That one could keep me busy for awile I think. This CD is great fun to listen to. I've only had it about 2 weeks, and already it is one of my favorites. There is not one song on here that I don't sing along to. The music is mostly sunny. There are three Ella and Louis duets here. Ella and Louis are perfection together. I'm glad they recorded together more than once. I have to sing the praises of mp3 downloading right now because without it I don't think I'd have found Ella. A troubling thought! Downloading the songs for free let me listen to an ENTIRE song as much as I wanted and to whichever song I wanted to, before I bought.
B00002DEH3|5.0|I agree with the other review, but there is an alternative to this set, by the Auryn Quartet, and it is also excellent. So, buy this set for the right reasons, whatever those are, such as:  the sound quality of this Chamber Ensemble (extremely warm)<BR>or the overall feel of their playing (caring, respectful).  Buy the set from the Auryn quartet if you care more about the sound quality of the recording (it is noticeably better) or if you happen to like a younger, slightly more aggressive approach.<BR>Frankly I have both sets, and love both.
B000000W5F|5.0|Tattoo You was originally released August 25, 1981, it went to #1 in both the UK & US.  The album includes the single hits Start Me Up, Hang Fire, and Waiting On A Friend.  It's also got Keith's ode Little T&A and Ronnie's Black Limousine.  Tops and Waiting On A Friend were pulled from the unreleased vaults (they were recorded in Jamaica during the 1972 Goats Head Soup sessions and Tops still had Mick Taylor on guitar).  Producer Chris Kimsey collected the best of the unreleased tracks from 1972 through 1979, featured the new hit Start Me Up, and added a new session (that produced Slave, Neighbours, and Heaven).  Most people know the music, so in my reviews I try to give you data on the sessions and interesting facts connected with the songs and the album.  Here we go:<br />Interesting notes include:<BR>.....the megahit Start Me Up was recorded during the same sessions that produced Miss You in New York in 1978....the Stones had abandoned the track but Chris Kimsey salvaged the single take, had Mick add new lyrics, and remixed it to create the version on the album<BR>.....the original title of the album was Tattoo....the \\"You\\" was added by Mick during last minute rushes<BR>.....Mick did last minute overdubs by himself without involving the rest of the Band, so he was the only person who knew what the new album would sound like before release<BR>.....Sonny Rollins got the inspiration for the sax in Waiting On A Friend by asking Mick to dance for him while he played<BR>.....when Mick Taylor heard the new album he realized he was playing guitar on Tops and had to sue his old band to get his royalties<br />There were 9 years worth of sessions that contributed to Tattoo You.  They started in Jamaica in 1972 finished with mixing at Atlantic in NYC during April - June, 1981.<BR>Nov 25-30, and Dec 6-21, 1972 at Dynamic Sound in Kingston, Jamaica (Goats Head Soup sessions)<BR>.....Tops<BR>.....Waiting On A Friend<BR>Nov 13-24, 1973 and Jan 14-28, 1974 at Musicland in Munich(It's Only Rock `n' Roll sessions)<BR>.....Black Limousine<BR>Dec 7-15, 1974 at Musicland in Munich (Black & Blue sessions)<BR>.....Slave<BR>Jan 23 - Feb 9, 1975 on the Rolling Stones Mobile in Rotterdam (Black & Blue sessions)<BR>.....Worried About You<BR>Mar 15-31, 1978 at Atlantic Sound in New York<BR>.....Start Me Up<BR>Jan 18 - Feb 12, 1979 at Compass Point Studios in Nassau (Emotional Rescue sessions)<BR>.....Little T & A<BR>Jun 10 - Aug 25 & Sep 12 - Oct 19, 1979 at Pathe Marconi/EMI Studios in Paris (Emotional Rescue sessions)<BR>.....Hang Fire<BR>.....Black Limousine<BR>.....No Use In Crying<BR>Nov-Dec, 1979 at Electric Lady in New York<BR>.....Start Me Up (final mix)<BR>Oct 11 - Nov 12, 1980 at Pathe Marconi/EMI Studios in Paris (the only Tattoo You sessions)<BR>.....Slave<BR>.....Neighbours<BR>.....Heaven<br />This information comes from \\"It's Only Rock And Roll: The Ultimate Guide To The Rolling Stones\\" by Karnbach and Bernson and from my own collection.
B00006F7XJ|5.0|It's well worth checking out!! Well in my opinion the previous issue of Rajaz was a typical &quot;Camel trademark&quot;, that is a modern sound characterized by a certain sad mood, carried out melancholy by Andy Latimer, without bombastic solos. His first concert in Italy so far, in Turin (October 2000), was a great show and I like to remark the good work of Guy Le Blanc (leader of Nathan Mahl) at the keyboards. Now such these vintage keyboards are so important in the new &quot;A nod and a wink&quot;, a very good support to Mr Latimer last effort, representing a new direction as well.The melody is always catchy together with this quite classical armony and mood, created by Guy Le Blanc!! <BR>Thank you Camel, you keep on arranging and playing tasteful albums, which touch our soul!!
B000068PQ0|5.0|I was not a fan of this band before this record.  I apparently like somwhat spacey art-rock, because this record started up with the song, \\"Fight Test\\" and I was sold.  At the end of the song, when the robot said \\"The test is over-r-r-r-r\\", I agreed.  I was already sold, so I could listen to the rest without judgement and it just seemed to get better.  I will agree with everyone that \\"Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots Part 2\\" is awful.  Skip it.  You could consider skipping the last track too, but everything else is so rich and pretty, I wouldn't do it for the world.  I think this record is so excellent because it works on so many different levels.  On one, it is a concept record as weird and interesting as Radiohead's Kid A.  However, it is prettier than Kid A.  Whereas that is cold, metallic, and uncomfortable, Yoshimi is warm and nice.  But on top of that, it is also funny.  In track 3, \\"Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots Part 1\\", when Wayne says, \\"she's gotta be strong to fight them so she's taking lots of vitamins\\", you pretty much know that this arty album isn't completely serious and stuffy either.  I also especially like the single, \\"Do You Realize\\", in which Wayne establishes that \\"everyone you know someday will die.  But instead of saying all of your goodbyes, let them know you realize that life goes fast.  It's hard to make the good times last.  You realize the sun doesn't go down. It's just an illusion caused by the world spinning around.\\"  I think that sums up this album.  Quirky, talented, catchy, light, but introspective, and ultimately, hopeful and sublime.  I would heartily recommend this record to anyone who is adventurous and likes the ultimate reward of taking in their pop music and their art simultaneously.
0380789035|5.0|AMERICAN GODS is a flummoxing experience- the nonplussed state you find yourself in as you make your way through the heady tome is a more than pleasant one.  At so many points, multitudes of junctures, vast numbers of interphases, a marveling feeling tends to spontaneously coalesce in the mind of the reader (at least, I'd imagine it would), a warm, smiling sensation which at first whispers then speaks then all-out shouts a sermon proselytizing the incredible experience Neil Gaiman has summoned from the apparently vast spring of his creativity.  This is a literary victory in the ongoing battle against jejune efforts, mediocre attempts, total failure of executions- this is a book which can and should be examined and absorbed by all those who complain that fine modern-day works are rare commodities; such staunch devotees of obligatory standards will find much to reward with GODS, and their precious cache of valuable jeweled praises will be significantly less heavy following the experience.<br />GODS centers on Shadow, a man who is forced into a cocoon of sorts when he is sent to prison; he doesn't realize it, but when he is released, his life has undergone a total metamorphosis, as thorough and complex as the conversion of chrysalis to moth.  Destiny has taken over, fate has intervened- and in what form does this metaphysical hand appear?  His name is Mr. Wednesday.  Strange, charming older gentleman.  Before Shadow knows it, the man has breached his world, become a part of it.  He knows things about Shadow, stuff he shouldn't be privy to, but is; he's also persuasive, with a charmingly disarming and dominant personality, so it doesn't take long for Shadow to agree to Wednesday's offer of employment.<br />This alliance denotes the commencement coordinate of Shadow's sojourn, a journey of fantastic- and phantasmagoric- pathways and stops.  He comes to realize that Wednesday is more than just a man- such nomenclature begs the most hyperbolic interpretation of the term `understatement', in fact.  Further, all of the `man's' cronies exist beyond the reaches of normal scientific reason.  Put quite simply, they are gods.  Gods of old, gods of yesteryear, gods of statures which brimmed with effulgent power and royal hierarchy in a forgotten past; they aren't what they used to be, they are archaic in the current cultural landscape, irrelevant anachronisms relegated to second-fiddle ghosts which roam the land and take whatever odd jobs that come their way.  So what happened to them?<br />Progress.  That noun which strikes awe and fear in the faces and the intellects of those who are steadfast in their ways and stubborn with respect to acceptance of displacement- and who are the displacers?  Well, the new gods of course.  The industrial complex of deity worship is not a static sector, it is as prone to demographic shifts and market realignments as any ordinary business.  As an example, take what you are utilizing to read this very review- cyberspace has become one of the freshly-vibrant new entities which has captured the staunch faith of so many of the country's flock.  And then there is television; it's been around a lot longer than Al Gore's purported invention, but it is still a young lord compared to Wednesday and his ilk.<br />Shadow finds out early on that his boss is planning something big- war.  An immense fiery fight to take place in the land of the idols.  He and Wednesday traverse the country, stopping at sacred spots full of mystical power and visiting the dwellings of many of the obsolete totems of mythology; like a president calling on the heads of state of foreign countries to talk up a coalition, he does his best to rally the troops and get them in fighting order.  But that's all superficial stuff; there's more going on here than just the oncoming storm.  Shadow meets many oddball characters- including his reanimated wife- and he learns much about the extra-reality which exists in addition to the normal three-dimensional world he's always known.<br />The above synopsis cannot be construed as anything approaching exhaustive in nature; from beginning to end, GODS sweeps you along an ever-shifting, highly-detailed presentation of plot...every twenty pages or so sees a new road about to be taken.

0385505833|1.0|It is my opinion that this book was not written by John Grisham.  It is a trite, sappy, story-book style Christmas tale, which is of little interest, especially if one doesn't care much about the holiday.  I read it to the end thinking that perhaps there would be a twist, or a surprise plot.  Instead, all I found was a childish, happy Christmas story ending.<br />Don't buy this book expecting Grisham quality or style, or you will be sadly disappointed.
B000063CMK|5.0|To start my review on this album I will have to tell that the opening track's lyric first begins &quot;She was twelve and I was only ten...&quot; and that is the only lyric I needed to hear. This album is haunting. The band's performance on this album is flawless. There is an obvious heaviness to this album which is normal for a progressive metal band, but there is also a strong melodical presence in the music. This presence is what seperates Pain of Salvation from most of their &quot;competition&quot; if you will. The guitar work here is outstanding! I understand that this is a concept album, but the music can stand on it's own merits as well. All in all, the music will have gripping your chair (due to the emotional element), but it will also have you playing air guitar. I have never heard of this band before untill I bought this album and I am by no means a fan of theirs, but after hearing this album it is hard not say that they are an incredibly dark, demented, and yet graceful all at once. Fans of progressive, metal, or even jazz for that matter will awe over the musical feat that this band produced with this album.
B00005JL0I|1.0|This isn't just bad; it's atrocious.  Shocked to the core, I was.  The moment I watched this I was stunned.  It did not follow Ian Fleming (it wasn't supposed to) and it wasn't funny.  It leaves me wondering why on earth I'd wasted so much time even buying it.<br />It is the most un-Bond, unfunny movie I've watched, ever.  Highly recommend you NOT to waste your money on someone who is not cool and is given a title that Ian Fleming serious despised, especially for his beloved character - 'Sir'.
0684800713|5.0|This is, of course, widely regarded as a classic, and whether you like it or don't like it and no matter what you write about it here, it will likely continue to be widely regarded as a classic for some time. That leaves one question: Should you read it or should you not read it? Somebody's review here says that every single other review (other than his) misunderstood the book. I have no opinion about this, and I'm not going to pour over every single other review in order to form one, but it does seem to me that THAT review (as is usually the case when such claims are filed) itself misunderstood it. I point this out to prepare you for the way I understand &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot;. It's FUNNY. Deliberately. So, to return to the question I posed, read its first few pages, and then, if you can't see any humor, if you are not amused and entertained, read something else.
B00005BCK6|5.0|&quot;A Piece of the Action&quot; occurs on a planet in which an alien society have based their entire lifestyle on a book left behind by a previous starship. The book is &quot;Chicago Mobs of the 1920's&quot;. Great fun in this episode. Watch Kirk drive a car. Listen to Spock talk like a gangster.<br />&quot;By Any Other Name&quot; is probable one of the most scariest episodes I can remember. Kirk watches helplessly as his ship is taken over by aliens &amp; his crew is reduced to cubical shapes.
B000002LLC|5.0|Bluntly, this is the one of the best albums out there.  Those who say Madonna can't sing have obviously never listened to this album, which even &quot;People&quot; magazine stated was one of the best of the year.  Madonna turns it down here, presenting a big-band sound that she wraps her silky-smooth vocals around.  She's playful, mournful, and down right soulful.  This is not something to be missed.<br />Choice cuts are the Oscar-winning &quot;Sooner or Later,&quot; the effervescent &quot;Hanky Panky,&quot; and the tribute to 80's excess &quot;More.&quot;  Won't disappoint.
B000068TPN|4.0|Finally there is a movie about the Vietnam War that puts the politics aside and tells the true story from the perspective of the participants, both combatants and those loved ones they left behind.  I did not serve in the Vietnam War nor, fortunately, have I ever been in combat, therefore I have absolutely no right to make judgements about how accurately the fighting portrayed in this film is.  However, I have read the book co-written by Lt. Gen. Hal Moore (Ret.) and Joseph Galloway and what I saw portrayed in the film was extremely close to what I read in the book.  Like the book, the film does not glorify war and violence, but it justifiably glorifies the courage and valor of all those who serve our country in times of war. This is not surprising since both men were consultants on the film.  The only real criticism I have is that because of the necessary use of time compression, there are times in the film when, if they have not read the book, the viewer may lose track of what is occuring where and when on the battlefield.  In closing I would like to say a personal Thank You to all the men and women who served the United States during the Vietnam War.
B00006J3T4|5.0|There's a part of me that, whenever I hear Knopfler's guitar, longs for the instrument to become what it wants be in his hands, a lead guitar.  Mark's been beating it into me that he's no longer interested in the pyrotechnics, and it took this CD for me to come to terms with that.  He finds inspiration from virtually anything, from Roadrunner to mulligan stew, and crafts stories that place us, for a few moments, somewhere far away, but somewhere real.  The music exists more than to provide atmosphere for the story, but to hold it aloft in caring hands.  This is a truly beautiful album that rewards the listener in greater measure with each listen.  Turn it up loud; it won't hurt your ears.
B00005J6RE|4.0|&quot;The Ultimate Computer&quot; is a typical Trek story of Kirk vs. the computer..Guess who wins? James Doohan (Scotty) does the voice of M-5.<br />&quot;The Omega Glory&quot; puts the crew on a &quot;parallel Earth&quot; in which the &quot;Yangs&quot; are servants to the &quot;Comms&quot;. It is later revealed that the &quot;Comms&quot; are &quot;Communists' &amp; the &quot;Yangs&quot; are &quot;Yankees&quot;. This episode contains many surprises after this....despite how incredible and far fetched they may be.
B000063UR2|5.0|The director's cut really shows how well the movie could have played out in the original release.  The U.S. release has always been a favorite of mine mainly due to its visual effects and its ability to pull the viewer into the film.  The plot was always a little jumpy.  The only way to get the movie is to allow yourself to be drawn into the visualization.  Most people today have a hard time doing that.  Therfore, they don't get it.  <BR>With the director's cut, the plot seems to flow much better.  I am split on the musical score. I think the Tangerine Dreams soundtrack works real well for the forest scenes and the dancing gown, and the Jerry Goldsmith score works well for the background tempo and ending sequence.  I think a molding of the the two versions would have been something special.  To me, they both are incredible movies that I'll always have on my top ten list.
B00005JLEX|5.0|Pay attention studios!  Seinfeld is in demand.  By the time Seinfeld is released it may be too late.  People are already taping episodes and then editing them into digital video files for use on Video CDs--thus negating the need for a DVD release!<br />I hope the DVD makers don't want to pass up an opportunity to make a sale...before it's too late!!<br />We want Seinfeld!  We want Seinfeld!<BR>Worlds are colliding--you're killing Independent George!!<BR>Serenity now! Serenity now!
B000069AUI|5.0|I previously reviewed Coldplay's sublime Parachutes and gave it high marks.  Then along comes the follow-up, A Rush of Blood to the Head, which is very much its equal (and almost as mellow).<br />I first heard track #5, &quot;Clocks,&quot; on a promo program on the radio in the early AM, and I was fascinated by its fresh sound.  The album, which I now own, is outstanding.  It is difficult to name my favorite song; tracks 1-11 all seep into and fill the mind with sonic richness, but &quot;Clocks&quot; is still probably the best, owing to harmonic originality (as I have explained in a  past review, I listen much more to notes than to lyrics).  Singer Chris Martin spins a fine web with his emotional vocals.<br />I anxiously await Coldplay's next album.

B00003CXIY|1.0|Yes, I liked American Pie and I loved American Pie 2, but Road Trip is only a rip-off. Seann William Scott is a great, funny actor full of energy, but he can't save this garbage. The only bad actor in this movie is Tom Green. Yes, I admit the story looks like fun, but it isn't. There are 2 funny scenes: The scene at the bridge and the scene with the blind woman and that's it. Pure garbage and a waste of time and money. The best comedy ever is still 10 Things I Hate About You!
B0000026KQ|5.0|My favorite Jeff Beck album.  Different.  Yes, I enjoy Bloww By Blow and Wired.  The more you listen to &quot;Jeff Beck's Guitar Shop&quot;, the better it gets.  Great driving music.  (Gotta get some more Slinkys).
B0000508U6|5.0|I was first interested in obtaining Coldplay's Parachutes upon reading an especially laudatory review of A Rush of Blood to the Head in the paper.  Unlike most of the band's admirers, I had not been particularly fond of their hit single &quot;Yellow,&quot; but I took a chance anyway.  <br />The decision has paid dividends.<br />If you are looking for tunes to elevate the soul, then you must get this album (and that also goes for A Rush of Blood to the Head, which might even top this one).  It reveals this band's ability to create a mature soundscape of pure quality.  The music is quite mellow and introspective, except for a couple of tracks, and fill one's ears with pleasure even after several dozen run-throughs.  Every track is worth listening to, and the ones that especially shimmer are the 3rd and 6th (&quot;Spies&quot; and &quot;Trouble&quot;).  I must admit, however, that I listen much more carefully to musical lines in songs than to lyrics, so it might well be true that the topics explored by singer Chris Martin are trite.  Ask me if I care.<br />I wholeheartedly recommend this album to anyone looking for the best that 21st-century alternative music has to offer.
B00006AG5N|5.0|This is a great sounding CD. And although you may have some or all of these on other discs this is just a great compilation you'll want to play over & over because it sounds so good.<BR>Look at it, from 1956-2002 there is a recording career of over 40 years.  Put the headphones on & turn up the volume ..you'll love this one!
B00006DEF9|5.0|Hello out there.  SITR was filmed in 1951, about four years before Cinemascope (&quot;The Robe&quot; being the first). I'm surprised you movie afficianados didn't know that.<br />So enjoy that it perfectly fills your 4-3 TV screen with nothing missing.
0783225792|4.0|In a kind of follow-up to Martin Scorcese's Goodfellas, the director takes another examination into the life of mobs and crime in this slow moving yet engaging film.<br />Casino reunites Scorcese with Robert De Niro and Joe in the criminal world of Las Vegas during the 1970's. And even though Casino has less action then Goodfellas, it still manages to suck the audience in. Sharon Stone and Joe Pesci both beautifully develop despicable characters, the kind of people you just can't stand, while De Niro rises above them all to become a character the audience can identify with.<br />Perhaps one of the best attributes to this film is how they get gambling right. As a former Blackjack dealer, I always notice how most films fail to remain authentic to real casinos. Dealers never deal right, security isn't portrayed correctly. But Scorcese's film is as authentic as it gets. And that's important in a film where you need to believe is real.<br />The inevitable comparison to Goodfellas undoubtedly and unfortunately hurts Casino. It is not quite the masterpiece that the former was. But this movie is great in its own rights, and should be viewed without thoughts of his previous film. <br />Casino is a must see film, with great depth of character, plot, and even a surprising twist at the end. Scorcese's still at the top of the game in Casino.
B00005JLEX|5.0|It is amazing that so many people voted this show 5/5. Also it is interseting to read all the comments by everyone. Now, Seifeld is showing on ABC at 11:30pm everyday. But one episode per day is far from satisfactory. Besides, I've seen some of the episodes more that twice, but still can't hold to watch it again and again and laugh out. And I think that's why I want to OWN it on DVD!<br />As a Chinese, I think it is pretty hard to add Chinese subtitle to it, because it is not easy to translate it well. If there is Chinese subtitle, I'll recommend it to EVERY Chinese I know! Even without Chinese subtitle, I'd like to buy it without a bit hesitation! (Hi, Elaine, isn't the '!' too much? ^_^)
B00006F7S4|1.0|This album is grossly overproduced and I wish I never bought it.  What happenned to Beck?  He was the genius behind Stereopathetic Soul Manure, One Foot In The Grave, Mellow Gold and Odelay and then it seems that the corporate 9-to-5ers got to him.  Every album since Odelay has been grossly overproduced and you will find the names of the producers in big letters on the back of each of his last three albums.<br />Also, it seems that the critics are afraid to criticize him.  <BR>Someone must be paying off these critics.  To all of the critics:  have some guts!<br />I now gladly use this cd as a coaster on my coffee table.  ...
0792101448|5.0|This is quite simply one of the best westerns ever made. I don't know why people like to compare this film with other John Ford classics, they don't have anything in common, and they both have very different takes on how a western should be made. Sergio Leone's characters are mythic figures of great proportion, be they heroes, antiheroes or villains. It is true that casting Henry Fonda as the villain was a stroke of genius, and I was amazed at how good Charles Bronson is in this film. But nobody gives enough attention to Jason Robards, I mean he comes this close to stealing the whole film. Robards is now remembered as one of the best of the character actors, but seeing this film I wonder why he never got a leading-man status. He steals every scene and his quiet scenes with Claudia Cardinale are extraordinarily tender and human (rare in a Leone western), his puppy-eyed expression and wis way of delivenring his dialogue accompanied with Morricone's excellent score (one of the best ever for a western) are just pure bliss. The final mythic showdown is also a sight to see and 'experience', Morricone's score adds a lot to the impact of the film. Claudia Cardinale, WHAT A WOMAN, she's an exotic italian voloptous beauty, the kind of girl you'd be more than happy to marry and have kids with. What a pressesnce though. The story is so-so and reality is blown way out of proportions, but one doesn't look for much reality or plausibility in a Spaguetti western. All in all, if you like westerns, you'll love this one, even though there is a lot more attention paid to the characters themselves than to really trying to make a statement on the taming of the west (as John Ford does). Is this the best Leone film? well 'The Good, the bad and the ugly' is also stunning, although not as mythic or overblown as this one and 'Once Upon a Time In America' is also very noteworthy, so it would depend on what you're looking for. I would highly recommend this film, and if you want to buy it, pickup the letterboxed edition because this film was not meant to be seen in it's cropped-up version! All in all, a solid 8.5 out of 10!!!
B00006IU73|5.0|The legend of these British progressive rock pioneers is only beginning to make its presence felt State-side on their Lava records debut, In Absetina, but the sonic impact of Porcupine Tree's creativity is already ingrained in musical folklore.<br />Where P-Tree earned their reputation as the next generation of complex excursions of epic proportions on past efforts, this  ime around they have opted more for an almost song-orientated  tructure in the imagery.  The textures and layers of sound are the manipulation of the progressive element this time helping to set more in moods and atmospheres as opposed to sheer musicianship.  This creates a more accessible sound molded around melodic development.<br />The mastermind behind the P-Tree experience (and it is just that, a full-on cerebral experience) is producer, writer, arranger and musician extrodinaire Steven Wilson.  He brings with him aspects of more than just traditional progressive approaches with the incorporation of folk and hard rock, hence his production credits with Opeth, as a centerpiece for the sounds he creates. <br />The songs vibrate with sheer genius in their creation.  There is a smoothness in the flow and a continuity of structure which keeps the listener intrigued from start to finish without<BR>feeling lost in the sonic adventure.<BR>  <BR>There is an ever so subtle nod to the past foundations of progressive rock ingenuity while not merely being a retread of those seminal accomplishments.  P-Tree stand apart from their contemporaries as well by emphasizing a darker aural ideal rather than the semi-operatic vocal deliveries and over-the-top guitar work which appear to have become almost the standard of the genre.  <br />All in all, there just are not the words to accurately describe what In Absentia entails and no way to do justice to the level of writing and execution in the music embedded on the CD.  There is no one way to pigeonhole the sound that is P-Tree and therefor no other way for one tocomprehend it than by taking the journey yourself by absorbing the songs themselves.
B00006J3T4|5.0|This is a wonderful album, in some ways a far cry from the Dire Straits sound. It emphasises the singing and songwriting talents of Mark Knopfler. It is more rootsy, has fewer long guitar solos but excellent guitar and music. The album is also not as rocky as most of his other outings. Like the cover, except for the first track and  possibly the third, the rest of the songs are more laidback or quiet. The cover says it all. <br />My favorite song is \\"A Place Where We Used to Live\\". The lyrics are so poignant that they struck a special chord deep inside me. The understated way of expressing all that is lost by saying \\"its just a place where we used to love\\" is just breath-taking. The rest of the album has this sense of understated-ness, something subtle. Marbletown is another lovely track with just MK singing and picking guitar, no other instruments.<br />The weak tracks are possibly the last two songs. I find it hard to like the sound of \\"Daddy's Gone To..\\". The other standout tracks are \\"Devil Baby\\", \\"Fare Thee Well...\\", \\"Marbletown\\", \\"You Don't Know..\\", \\"Hill Farmer Blues\\" and \\"Coyote\\". <br />Those looking for Telegraph Road like solos won't find it here, but those looking for good music will find this an oasis in a sea awash with mediocre stuff.
B00004XQP4|5.0|I had heard clips of this cd and I originally thought it was horrible.  I actually only thought Church on Sunday was the only reason to buy the album.  I put it in and was surprised, songs i hated at first grew on me and made this a very palatable album.  Green Day is not playing POP music on this album (contrary to some other reviewrs here)instead they have leaned to more of a Kinks style.  They have matured, but there are still some juvenile lyrics here and there (blood, sex and booze and deadbeat holiday)  i say this is a great ROCK and ROLL album.
B00006AFUR|5.0|This type of album doesn't surface that often, so when it does, make sure you know about it. It is the best album of the year in my opinion...it's such a change from the usual. This is NOT the usual. <br />The ethereal, off-beat, scifi genius of it will make you want to listen to it over and over until you can hear it everywhere you go.  So you know all the lyrics, all the guitar riffs, and all the drumming. You won't be able to get enough of it.<br />Trust me, if you liked Perfect Circle's Mer de Noms, you WILL love this.<br />GO! BUY IT NOW!
B00003CX5P|4.0|I'm finding the scathing reviews of this film laughable.  I mean what did you people think?  Anyone who can't see that there was absolutely no way Lucas could have even come close to living up the expectations of this movie - is naive to say the least.  Sure the movie has flaws and could have been better, but not a whole lot better.  <br />Phantom Menace has three main flaws:<br />1. The ending space battle against the \\"control\\" ship featured no attack plan, but rather Anakin just bumbling around up there in space accidentally blowing the ship up.  This creates a serious credibility problem, but more importantly doesn't give the audience any guidance as to what to be routing for, and then what to cheer for when it's achieved.   <br />2. The ground battle was too cartoonish, and needed to be more violent...But worst of all was Jar Jar's bumbling around clumsily while participating in the battle.  Come on - Jar Jar a General?...P>3. The Vice Roy (spelling?) of the Trade Federation didn't come off as genuinely evil in their demeanor.  Their speaking accents were dorky, clumsy and too light mannered.  They just didn't give off a convincing \\"evil\\" vibe.  On top of this, all the \\"suffering of the people\\" of Naboo caused by the Trade Federation and its army was never shown - only spoke of.  This only further lessened the \\"evil\\" creadibility of the Trade Federation.<br />Had these problems been anticipated and fixed, this film would have been much more convincing, but still wouldn't have lived up the expectations.<br />And those that criticize the acting in PM - come on.  The acting in the first trilogy is even worse in some ways (exceptions are Alec Guiness, Peter Cushing, James Earl Jones, Ian McDiarmid, and Frank Oz). <br />I wonder if the \\"Star Wars Generation\\" (which I am a member of) is more critical of this film because they are no longer kids, and are much more sensative to the flaws in a movie's acting, plot or action sequences?  I tend to think so.
B000000LZV|5.0|This is an extraordinary album.  The sheer amount of information crammed into it - words, arguments, discussions, obscure references, letters, memories - is almost unrivalled.  That'd still be the case even if the music itself sucked.  But the music is just as amazing - the unorthodox energy of the playing gives the album another unique facet.<br />There's too much variety and overall quality in the album to single out individual tracks.  It's all brilliant and unmissable.
B000066NW0|5.0|... I decided to give the Track list another try when I saw the CD on the listening posts, I started to listen to just the first track and she won me over, I am now a HUGE Avril Lavigne fan. So here is my review of the songs:<br />1. Losing Grip 5/5 - Very Rocky, this is one of the best songs on the CD, it describes a relationship she had where the guy didn't care, and yet she did but then decided to ditch it because he wasn't in it 100%<br />2. Complicated 3/5 - Like I said, I hated it at first, then it grew on me and I liked it, but now I kinda like it, I'm kinda sick of hearing it so much, but when you haven't heard it in a while it's good again<br />3. Sk8er Boi 4.5/5 - A VERY good song, although the lyrical outcomings (He was a boi, she was a girl...What More can I Say?) are a little short, but still this is a good Punk/Pop song, ... Althought we changed it to a clucked version instead of a singing one.<br />4 I'm With You 5/5 - This is a beautiful song, it shows that Avril actually can sing, their are some singers that are only good at singing one kind of song, either a fast one or a ballad, but in I'm With You Avril clearly proves she conquers both worlds.<br />5. Mobile 4.5/5 - This is song reminds me of my sister who lives in Calgary because at the beginning it talks about going back home, but then having to leave. This has a REALLY catchy tune, a little on the Pop side, some people may not like it.<br />6. Unwanted 3/5 - I have mixed feelings about this song. It's slated as the final release from Let Go, It will win over fans...This is a really rocky song, I have to be in the mood to listen to it though, I like it but I don't , it's wierd.<br />7. Tomorrow 4/5 - I've come to realize that 6 and 7 are the wierd points of the CD, from a really hard rocky song to a slow ballad, the transition is to much to fast, maybe if they put an in-between song it would come out better, This is a good song tho, the only problem is that it's out of place.<br />8. Anything But Ordinary 5/5 - This is the song the record label is trying to pass as her Theme Song, because let me tell you! Avril Lavigne is anyting but ordinary. She's got talent, looks,... I think I'm in love!<br />9. Things I'll Never Say 6/5 - This song PERFECTLY describes me, although it was ment to be about a guy I think it can also be ment to talk about a girl, this song is MY theme song, I LOVE IT!<br />10. My World 6/5 - This and Things are my fav. songs on the CD, this song PERFECTLY describes what my life is like.... and I can relate to Avril in this song. This song is by far, the single most reason to buy this CD<br />11. Nobody's Fool 4.5/5 - Avril tries to rap in this song, while she's no Ja Rule or Nelly she does a so-so job, I find this song very funny. (But not because of her rap)<br />12. Too Much To Ask 4/5 - I kinda don't like this song, yet I do, I can relate to the first part about being lonely, it's just a strange song again....<br />13. Naked 5/5 - I Love this song! This along with Things describes my love-life down to a Tee. It's almost as if Avril knew what I'm going thru and then wrote about it.<br />And there you have it! My honest opinion about Avril Lavigne's CD. A 5 Star CD if I ever saw one!
B000065V1V|4.0|&quot;Heathen&quot; is a strong piece of work, full of colorful, resonant songs and intricate production. It's quite refreshing after hearing his previous album, &quot;Hours...,&quot; which, although I thought it contained some interesting stuff, didn't prove to be particularly memorable in my case. &quot;Heathen,&quot; on the other hand, is the sort of album that dwells in my mind, either in the foreground or the background, long after the tape stops rolling. Even &quot;I Took a Trip on a Gemini Spaceship&quot; and &quot;A Better Future,&quot; my least favorite tracks, are catchy enough to make me involuntarily start humming them in the shower. And the standout songs, &quot;Slip Away,&quot; &quot;Slow Burn,&quot; and &quot;Everyone Says 'Hi,'&quot; are really knock-out material. &quot;Hi,&quot; for example, has a very easy-going melody and sounds extremely optimistic, as though it were flooded with sunlight.<BR>     Bottom line: good songs, compelling arrangements, excellent playing, and fine vocal performance from Bowie. Although I wouldn't call it a &quot;must-buy&quot;-like &quot;Ziggy Stardust,&quot; &quot;Diamond Dogs,&quot; &quot;Low,&quot; etc.-I think this album is definitely worth buying.
B00003CY0U|2.0|Slick, empty, disconnected. How else to describe this sad attempt at entertainment? There is no continuity, no character development, nothing to really sink your teeth into. Consider the famous shot of Halle Berry in the nude. Oh, sure, all the macho studs were howling for more, but it had absolutely nothing to do with the story. In fact it serves to destroy what little momentum there is up to that point. You're moving along with the action and then suddenly Berry's bare breasts are staring you in the face. My reaction was \\"What's going on here, did I miss something?\\" Then there's the scene where Hugh Jackman goes waltzing into Berry's bedroom only to find her wearing a wire along with her skimpy lingerie, whereupon she admits to being a spy for the DEA. I was expecting to learn more about Berry's involvement with the DEA but it's just left hanging in mid-air. This is but one of many strange startings-and-stoppings throughout this pathetic flick. Add another dog to Travolta's growing string of cinematic failures. This flop is right up there with his other duds like \\"Face-off\\" and \\"Battleship Earth\\".
B00006IU73|5.0|On the first listening it sounded odd, allmost disappointing...! <br />It's been 5 months and I'm still coming back to this misteriuos concept album. Why is this band not on the mainstream indicates that we are being controlled by some square heads in the music industry. I've been enjoing PT's music for the last 4 years, favorites are: \\"Down the Upstairs\\", \\"The Sky Moves Sideways\\", \\"Signify\\", \\"Stupid Dream\\", \\"Stars Die\\", \\"Recordings\\" and at a lesser degree \\" Light Bulb Sun\\" till I listen to it and change my mind again. Can't decide which one is better.....<BR>    In Absentia just got added to the list.<BR>    By the way I love Ozrics Tentacles (own their latest DVD), \\"Liquid Tension Experiment\\" and of course the old Prog.<BR>    IA flows at an incredible level of emotions that fit into several generations of music lovers. 2nd song Trains is a must, Lips of Ashes takes me back to Entangled from \\"Trick of a Trail\\", The creator has a Masterpiece doesn't sound like Gabriel but it remindes me of his first Solo Album (Car). The Sound of Muzak is a favorite, the lyrics are so descriptive of why this band is not on Radio and one of the \\"Main Stream\\".<BR>  For this price you will make your self a favor by getting it.<BR>  It is Psychotherapeutical Trippy Metal Music for the Ego and Soul......      Can't get enough of PT.

Never Say Never Again is a masterpiece that is full of action, adventure and all-out fun of the highest order!
B000007177|4.0|The first CD is nonsensical, but in a Very Good Way.  It's much more playful than its cousin (A Passion Play), though it is quite interesting to listen to the two side-by-side just for the sake of comparison.<br />The second CD leaves me, like many other reviewers, wondering why some of these songs were left off of the regular releases.  My particular favorites: &quot;Silver River Turning&quot;, &quot;Man of Principle&quot;, &quot;Rosa on the Factory Floor&quot;, &quot;Lights Out&quot; and &quot;I Don't Want to Be Me&quot;.
B0000042MY|4.0|I love this soundtrack, but was very disappointed that the movie version of Promentory was not on the cd. Does anyone know of a cd with the movie version on it?
B00005QAPH|5.0|8 1/2 What can I say? This is one of the most influential films ever created, and it has been brought to us by criterion in one of the most beutiful video transfers ever made. The two disc set has more extras than you'll know what to do with, and as i said, the picture is totally spotless, as if you were viewing it on the day of it's release! If you haven't seen the film, you should, If you have seen the film, go see it again. In any event, I won't spoil the plot, only say i that Fellini has given us the most incredible view of surreal expressionism, and any lover of fine art should apreciate it, thanks again Criterion.
B00004STPT|5.0|This is the best soundtrack I have ever heard. I own many of them, but this has been my favorite ever since I got it. My favorite traks are &quot;Am I Not Merciful?&quot;, &quot;Elysium,&quot; and &quot;Now We Are Free.&quot;
B000002HAF|5.0|This album is nothing less than amazing. Don't listen to the reviewers who say that this album is boring or overrated. I can listen to these songs no matter what kind of mood I'm in. I listen to it almost constantly. The melodies are downright beautiful, yet the music somehow manages to be extremely harsh and angry at the same time. Black Francis has the best voice in rock and Kim Deal complements him perfectly. I only have one warning: Listen to this with an open mind! It is very weird at first!
B00006CXSS|5.0|My husband and I watched every single episode of this epic the first time it was shown on HBO and I must say, I have watched almost every episode a second time when it was rerun.  Quite simply, this is one of the best movies (the word \\"mini-series\\" does not do it justice) that has ever been made.  You laugh, you cry and you get to know these real men very well by the time of the last part.  I wish all children in schools across the US could see this in history class and I wish we would all take time to tell the veterans how much we appreciate the sacrifices that they made for us.
6305842442|1.0|The voice-over made the original movie comprehensible. It also imparted the film noir atmosphere of old black-and-white movies. Without Harrison Ford's voiceover, this movie is a mish mash of disconnected sequences. Nothing ties together. Get the original version on VHS if you can.
0553106635|5.0|I have to be honest.  When I picked up these books a mere two months ago I was thinking, \\"Yeah, right\\".  A co-worker and fellow reader had avidly (or should I say \\"rabidly\\"?) extolled the virtues of this series, and, trusting her advice, I plunked down my gas money and bought all three.  That evening I sat gingerly turning the first volume in my hand, what with it's perfunctory fantasy-type illustration gracing its front and the less than informative teaser on the back.  Figuring that I should not let my investment go to waste (and partly thinking that I would just return them for the cash) I began to read.  Six hours later, I finally finished \\"A Game of Thrones\\", scarcely stopping to breathe.  These books are by far the best written fantasy novels I have read (with the possible exception of Tolkein's, whom I cannot betray based on my long standing endearment to his work).  <br />These stories have it all.  Murder, intrigue, sex, dragons, wargs, wights, and war; and as each chapter looks from a different point of veiw, we are invited to glimpse the inner workings of each man and woman caught up in this life and death struggle for power.  Martin pulls no punches in this tale; there are consequences for every action and no one is spared.  These become real people to the reader, and we are drawn in because we see ourselves in its pages, fantasy though the setting be. <br />An opus of strength and will which evokes a visceral response in the reader!  Sublime. This is a series to stock extra copies for freinds.
B00003CXS4|4.0|Granted, as it has been written before, \\"Snatch\\" breaks very little cinematic ground when compared to Guy Ritchie's equally entertaining debut \\"Lock Stock\\". He uses many of the same high octane editing and super smooth camera angles as well as snappy smart dialouge that is hip, profane and quotable much in the vein of Tarantino. And because of that overriding similarity to the previous film, \\"Snatch\\" a very very entertaining and intoxicating work in its own right, suffers from the \\"been there done that blues\\".<br />That said, \\"Snatch\\" possesses a phenomenal ensemble of character actors all playing at the top of their game. There is not a weak sister to be found in the 98.9% male cast (save for the all too brief turn by the charming twins!). Like Tarantino, Ritchie structures his films like novels. He manages to balance character exposition with true development. It is far too rare to see real character development in contemporary film.<br />Where Ritchie surpases Tarantino, is in his ability to be hip without resorting to the endless self-conscious parade of pop culture reference. Tarantino's characters are often too self aware, while Ritchie manages to create beings that live truly in the moment, without awareness of the world at large.<br />Ritchie does need ( like Tarantino!) to vary he work, or he will end up repeating himself endlessly and lose the audience he so richly deserves.<br />Snatch is a great DVD also. The extras are a delight. The \\"making of\\" documentary really shows care and insight. The atmosphere that Ritchie creates on the set fosters the high energy spunk of his movies. The deleted scenes add fleshing out to the detail heavy movie and are a blast in their own right. A special feature allows the viewer to re-insert the deleted scenes into the film. <br />All in all, not a great movie, but an extremely entertaining story that out Tarantinos Tarantino.
B00006AFUR|5.0|Ahh 30 Seconds To Mars.  I first heard about these guys at an Incubus show, because they opened up for them.  I only got to hear 2 songs, due to me and my friends' lack of punctuality.  The 2 songs I did hear though, were great, and that spurred me to check them out online whenever I got back to a computer.<br />What I discovered was amazing.  Not only did I discover a lot of cool things, I also discovered that actor Jared Leto, was their lead singer.  Now you and I both know, that the norm for bands with actors in them, is to suck trememdously.  Well not here my friend, no sir.  I was blown away by how good Jared's voice is.  He is by far at the top of the heap of bad actor's who crossed over to music.<br />This cd is a sort of space rock show, that will keep you on the edge of your seat, with interesting lyrics and musical depth.  I would highly suggest getting this cd.  In fact, your hands are simply useless, unless this cd is in them!!!
B000001Y5J|5.0|Only one slower song on here and it's Trent's version of Adam Ant's Physical. Trent created this in secret when he was still under contract with TVT, a record company he was very displeased with, to say the least! The emotion shows it this, his fifth work of art. I can't say its my favorite album he has done, that only because I love them all.  This is definitely the heaviest album, I would say it is Industrial meets Metal in a big clash, it really rocks. Songs inc. The grammy award winning Wish, Gave Up, Suck and the center piece, Happiness In Slavery. There are only 8 songs on it making it an EP, but it is worth  every little penny.
B000002UR7|4.0|Before all the indie-rock elitists jumped on the Radiohead bandwagon, they thumbed their noses at this so-called grunge \\"one-hit wonder.\\"  To all the others who liked Creep and bought the album and liked it, the progression from this to the rest was not really all that surprising.  For a radio song, \\"Creep\\" had a most unusual hook, i.e. Jonny's burst of guitar noise before the chorus.  That alone got me into this band, I was 11 at the time and kind of a radio tool, as people like to call them.  That little germ of originality is kind of what this album is about.  Its derivative yes, but the gang gave it its own little touch.  Basically, Jonny's rabid noise fest guitarwork, which in retrospect is kind of My Bloody Valentine-ish, was bracing.  It was different than the typical power-chord progressions of most bands of the grunge era.  Another reviewer said that true Radiohead fans shudder at the thought of \\"creep.\\"  Thats a little pompous, what is a true fan, I'm a fan, I enjoy their music, I like Creep, so I'm not a true fan.  But if a true fan is a snobbish intellectual who has delusions of intelligence but rather just meanders on about nothing, like most of the population of Radiohead fans, I would rather not be one.  I enjoy taking cracks at the scores of psuedo-intellectual fans of RH, its fun, as if their taste in music makes them superior to someone who likes catchy pop music.  Its funny, really.   But on to the subject at hand, I like Pablo Honey, its no masterpiece, but as a debut album it is solid and still enjoyable.  Too many bands and/or singers come flying out of the gates only to just die off slowly and painfully.  Radiohead obviously didn't.
B00005JK8K|2.0|I found this particular movie much of the same old genra of most WWII movies.  Nick Cage is a fantastic actor and I enjoyed most of the characters.  However; the story and most of the scenes were no where near the realism of Private Ryan.  As one of your coined \\" the private Ryan of the Pacific\\" I found incredibly inaccurate.  Plus if you pay attention you will notice much of the combat scenes take place in a desert setting.  The battle for Saipan actually was more of a jungle setting somewhat like Guam or Okinawa.  As usual Hollywood should pay more attention to accuracy then they do.  Many in the audience saw this and it certainly hurt the realism and effected the story as well.
B000005ALP|5.0|'Beautiful Freak' is without doubt the best of the Eels: an emotive, gorgeous, complex, sad work tinged with regret and sadness yet steeped in beauty and musical loveliness. Firstly I must lay a few ghosts to rest. To start with, 'Novocaine For The Soul' (***) is by no stretch of the imagination the best track on this CD, and I'm not just saying this to be different, it genuinely is not anywhere near the best. In fact I've never quite understand why it is the best-known track by Eels.<br />Instead, find the perfect pop song in 'Guest List' (*****), a hugely moving work with great bass, a wonderful harmonica solo and the chorus 'Everyone needs to be somebody/everyone needs to find someone who cares' with E's voice almost breaking under the sadness in the most beautiful way. Susan's House (****) is a classic dark pop song, all lilting piano and monologue sections masking dark-as-anything lyrics, and 'Beautiful Freak' (****), 'Spunky' (****) and 'Flower' (****) are lovely ballads of love and beauty.<br />The rockier side of the CD is rounded off by the single 'Rags to Rags' (****), 'My Beloved Monster' (****), the stunningly sad 'Not Ready Yet' (*****), which features some truly excellent guitar playing (if you like this track, please check out 'Without You I'm Nothing' by Placebo) and especially the only really grungey track, 'Mental' (*****), an electro-rock masterpiece with big, grungy guitars and a mad, screaming synth solo.<br />Finally the CD is rounded off with two more excellent tracks, 'Lucky Day In Hell' (*****), a darkly angry song with a deceptively quiet chorus and the lovely, stripped-down, sad yet uplfiting 'Manchild' (****). Here ends a classic, wonderful CD. Beautiful. 5 stars.
B00006F7XJ|5.0|Love this CD! It is Camel at their best! Magical stuff similar to earlier CDs like Rain Dances and Breathless. If you have ever enjoyed any of their music you will most likely love this one too! Great band still creating quality music. Buy lots of copies!
020530902X|5.0|The Elements of Style is a must have book for all writers. Strunk &amp; White are incredibly forthright in their approach to composition, form and style. I was particularly appreciative of the enlightenment of Chapter four. My understanding of commonly misused expressions was drastically challenged after completing this segment of the book. I personally enjoyed the no nonsense &quot;attitude&quot; in getting straight to the point. The Elements of Style is a powerful tool to assist writers in every aspect of expression. I can truthfully say that this book comes highly recommended. It isn't long and drawn out but it certainly packs a punch! My fiction and non-fiction writing will never be the same as I apply these principles to my forthcoming manuscripts. Kudos!

0792839625|2.0|A Chorus Line is one of my all-time favorite musicals.  The trash job done on this movie version is criminal.  From the casting of Michael Douglas as the director to the expansion of the storyline to cutting some of the best production numbers.  <br />Richard Attenborough tried and failed to make this movie more than what it ever could be.  The expansion of the storyline is to me a collosal waste of time, it's about the audtion.  Produstion numbers should have been lengthened not shortened and then the new numbers would have been ok.<br />The only bright spot in this entire movie Allyson Reed in the role of Cassie.  <br />Since this is the only opportunity for most folks to see a least a pseudo-version of the musical, it's not really an option not to see it at least once.  The music and production numbers work, and even though there is nothing like live theatre the score is great and I love a good production number.
B000002UYZ|5.0|Teenage appeal aside, the Beatles were a tremendous group that were peerless in talent, chart supremacy, and cultural impact.  Casual listeners may want to consider \\"1,\\" but for a more comprehensive survey of the band's early work, \\"1962-1966\\" (or the \\"Red\\" album) is the way to go. I won't go on about the Number One hits (\\"She Loves You,\\" \\"Yesterday,\\" \\"We Can Work it Out,\\" and so forth).  What makes this CD a must-have is how it compiles the group's work by also including lesser hits and album cuts that were never released commercially but are key favorites.  There's Lennon's introspective and remarkably mature lyrics in \\"In My Life,\\" the catchy \\"You've Got to Hide Your Love Away,\\" McCartney's perky \\"All My Loving,\\" and the folk-ish flavor of \\"Norweigan Wood.\\"  Personally, I would have liked to have seen more tracks from the \\"Revolver\\" album (such as \\"Got to Get You into My Life\\"), but that's a small gripe from me.  \\"1962-1966\\" is a fun ride and a brilliant glimpse of the best pop group of all time.
B00004TH6O|5.0|Queens of the Stone Age are nothing short of an anomaly in this day and age: a band who deliver music on their own terms, are diametrically opposed to the cult of commercialized, desensitized, washed out 'nu' rock music that has sprung up across the world and invaded our tvs, radios and lives. Rising from the ashes of the legendary Kyuss as they did, it was clear that QOTSA were always going to be a band that stand out from the crowd. While their self titled debut was astounding in its own right, this album redirects their efforts into a far more consistent, wildly original area of the musical spectrum. Simply put, there isnt another band on the planet that sounds like QOTSA. Kyuss mark two they most certainly are not, as here Josh Homme, surely one of rocks most prolific cult figures, produces an album of massively varied musical style and thematic content, yet somehow manages to integrate melodies and catchy hooks into the otherwise incomprehensible rush of noise and adrenaline that other, lesser bands would die for. Kicking off as it does with the limited vocabulary of 'Feel good hit of the summer', ... one would be forgiven for believing the album will be a simple, three chord affair. Yet 'The lost art of keeping a secret' soon dispels any such assumptions, featuring as it does one of the best choruses Ive ever heard, as well as a laughably simplistic keyboard line. Then we have the tripped out 'Leg of lamb' which contains addictive vocal harmonies and more mellow tendencies, soon backed up by the even more tripped out 'Better living through chemistry' which im not even going to attempt to describe here. 'Monsters in the parasol' and 'Quick and to the pointless', provide welcome relief in the form of short, straightahead rock anthem material, while 'In the fade', for me the album's highlight, features a Mark Lanegan guest vocal spot and takes the band in an almost grunge-esque direction, while never abandoning their distinctive instrumental sound.<br />Probably the best album of 2000, this is a must for any rock fan. QOTSA occasionaly fail to appeal to some for unknown reasons: perahps Josh Homme's voice irritates or the sparse guitar sound is perceived as lacking. I would certainly recommend giving this album a lenghthy trial period, as some of the material takes time to sink in and, undestandably, such a unique sounding band engenders some initial doubt.<br />Minor worries though, as this is a stunning album. Original, inventive, powerful, addictive. With such commendable accolades, how can you afford not owning this?e best album of 2000, this is a must for any rock fan.

B000002UZ1|5.0|&quot;1967-1970&quot; (or the &quot;Blue&quot; album) compiles singles, Number One hits, and key album cuts from the &quot;Sgt. Pepper,&quot; &quot;The Beatles,&quot; &quot;Abbey Road,&quot; and &quot;Let it Be&quot; albums.  Unlike &quot;1,&quot; which excludes important tracks that didn't top the chart, the Blue album is a more comprehensive survey of the group's later work.  There's the deliciously trippy &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever,&quot; the impossibly catchy &quot;Revolution,&quot; George Harrison's masterpiece &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps,&quot; and a personal favorite of mine, the bluesy b-side &quot;Don't Let Me Down.&quot;  Another gem is John Lennon's strikingly beautiful &quot;Across the Universe&quot; pulled from the &quot;Let it Be&quot; album.  Haunting and surreal, it's a nice segueway into the closing track, the Number One hit &quot;The Long and Winding Road.&quot;  Arguably one of the most vital greatest hits albums on the market, &quot;1967-1970&quot; is required listening.
B000068QY7|5.0|In my opinion, oasis have never released a bad album. This album is great. It posses somthing that many other bands around just now have tried to  master, but cant: simple yet brilliantly catchy rock and roll songs. Although this album doesnt contain the class that Whats the story morning glory has, it is still one of the best albums of the year. So don't go along with the steriotypes. Be who you be. Buy this album.
0060931671|1.0|Okay, first off I'm not a conservative, I like modern life, I don't believe that things were better in the good old days etc.  But how can modernist drivel like this ever be considered brilliant?  Has there ever been a novel more pointless, more vague, with less interesting characters and with less redeeming value?  I don't think so.  Oh, I guess I'm supposed to applaud Pynchon for being so inventive and different from everybody else.  Yeah, well that's all well and good, but not enough in itself to make a good novel.  Maybe it's because I was born in the late 70's and I'm not a hippie that I don't understand the cosmic significance of the Tristero whatever that is.  San Narcisco?  That is supposed to be brilliant?  It's just a clever little wordplay that any High School student could write in one of their papers.  And the writing of the title as the last words of the novel?  Please.  Why is that such a literary feat? <BR>I guess the point of the novel was not to have a point.  I'm sorry, but that is just taking the easy way out.  At least put some effort into making me feel something and ask questions about myself.  Oh, the book was trying to do that?  It's making me wonder what it all means and what is the meaning of life? Hello! Who needs to read this book to ask those questions?  Everyone asks themselves those questions naturally.  There's nothing particularly briliant in that concept.    Anyway, I'll stop now because I'm not by nature a cynical guy and all this negativity is killing me. I'm just a little upset at having to torture myself reading this for a class.
B00006F7S4|5.0|This cd was an incredible change from the previous works of beck. The melodies and harmonies in the tracks were beyond belief and made for beautiful music. I wasnt aware of how versitile he could be until I picked up sea change. from the moment I plugged it into the old cd player I was captured. its melodic to the point of being hypnotic. it has a radiohead feel with the quality of pink floyd in their prime. I strongly recommend this album to anyone who is a fan of music.
B000000H40|5.0|In my cd collection (which I only keep real metal albums in) I have many death metal albums. Some of them stay on my shelf collecting dust for awhile, but not this one. Everything on this alubm is great. This album, unlike some bands which tend to lean towards image more than music, has everything played out perfect. The guitars and vocals go very good together (Unlike some bands which only have just one of these factors). It is also amazing to know that they actually came from Florida (no wonder why they sing about death and all in their music). For those who like earlier good death metal, they should get this album.
B00006RCOB|4.0|This is one of my favorite classics. It was so exciting to see the black pilot stole a top secret super jet in front of russian noses!!. A lot of creativity, super speed effects and great drumming soundtrack.  If you like the Cold war ambience and aerial scenes this is a classic you must get in your rack!.<BR>Enjoy Mach 5.
B000002KZ6|5.0|From the first track, the classic \\"Burning Down The House\\" to the final, euphoric \\"This Must be the Place,\\"  this album puts a big old smile on your face!  It makes you feel like dancing, running, jumping and loving.  Even playing this album for little kids, they instinctively get up and start bouncing around; it's just that infectious.  Like others, I have always been insanely moved by the aforementioned \\"This Must be the Place,\\" which I think just might be the best song this wonderful band ever wrote, which is certainly saying something.  Still, at this great price, you'd be foolish not to add this joy to your life!
0380977788|5.0|Gaiman's book is filled with dread from the first few pages onward; it is a dread that permeates the story via his descriptive prowess, ability to nail his metaphors, and the weird-perfect symbolisms that pop up constantly. Obviously, the buttons are a most horrifying and disturbing motif. This is a nervous story, an ominous story, a chilling story; it skitters about in any number of malevolent directions like Coraline's final \\"enemy.\\" Yet, the book never drops the silken thread of its purpose, which is to unspool a modern fairy/horror-tale that grows black, black, and frightfully BLACKER with every page. I'm not certain this is yet on a par with 'Alice in Wonderland' (let's wait another fifty years and see), but it certainly ranks with the best of Dahl's work in terms of theme, style, and sheer impact. A winner, to be certain. But leave it for kids ages 11 and up; the hideous evil lurking beneath this tale insinuates itself even after the story is finished and the memory of it will be very difficult for younger kids to dismiss. A final note: the illustrations are, in my opinion, not up to a par with the impact of the story.
B000002UB3|5.0|Whilst you are reading this collection of &quot;reviews&quot; you could be listening to this truly amazing album!<br />Take the hint...
B00006AW2P|4.0|Raw, early Stones.  Dated?  Sure -- but not as much as you'd think.  Not as much as, say, &quot;Please Please Me&quot;....or &quot;Emotional Rescue&quot;. (smirk)
B000069AUI|5.0|This is a suberb album. I have to comment here that I find it annoying with all the comparisons to Travis and Radiohead, et al. They are really quite different. I thoroughly enjoyed their first outing \\"Parachutes,\\" and feel they have only matured with this album. I think they have taken things lyrically from a more ambiguous terroritory and into a much more forceful and persuasive reflections, something that I think Travis and Radiohead fail utterly on. It is nice to have more than just the music/melody resound within me...Additionally, I think Coldplay has a much higher replay value than Travis (Radiohead does score here). Like the first album, \\"A Rush of Blood...\\" kept me listening over and over again. Coldplay is one of those rare bands that produces songs that I like the more I listen to it - something to savour over time. Both their albums, I was not completly sold to at first - but the more I listen, the more I fall in love - until this becomes what is just one of the finest albums in a good long time.
B00005JL78|5.0|I was of two minds in regards to this movie, I wasn't sure whether it would be worth seeing initially, because I thought it looked cool, but wasn't sure if there was any substance to it, at least at first.  Then I finally went to see this film, and I was COMPLETELY blown away.  the film was so overwhelming in the way this possible future was done, I was thrown for a loop, completely, this film kept me guessing all the way through, it almost made me cry, it held me in suspense, and had me on the edge of my seat.  The film was so excellently executed, and this film MORE than makes up for Steven Spielberg's sci-fi ... 'AI'.  the special effects are extraordinary, and the storyline is very smart, the cast portrayed their characters extremely well, with depth, emotion, and superb acting quality.  this is a definite MUST HAVE for any sci-fi fan.
6303394000|4.0|Bob Fosse is one of the great American directors. Certainly in the world of theater and Broadway he is recognized as such. He won so many Tony Awards they should change the name to Fosse's, but as a film director I don't think he gets as much credit as he deserves. His style is so unique, blending his musical theater with film, I have never seen it's equal, yet most remember Fosse as a great Broadway director. The film All That Jazz isn't exactly what I would call a traditional narrative film, but that is the point, and that makes it great.<br />Perhaps the most interesting aspect of All That Jazz is the autobiographical element to the film. Much like Welles did with Citizen Kane, Fosse almost eerily predicted his own demise. In 1974 Fosse was cutting his film Lenny, and simultaneously preparing his next Broadway show when he had a heart attack. Five years later he made it the subject for All That Jazz. However in the film, Gideon, played by Roy Schider, has a different outcome than Fosse did, although Fosse would never slow down and his self-indulgence would eventually lead to his death.<br />Everything about All That Jazz is top notch: the acting, the story, the cinematography, the choreography, especially the choreography. The great influence of Fosse is his dance, and it really is something to behold. No one else did it like Fosse so it's great he eternalized it on film. Few directors could pull it off, if any, the way Fosse did. The film beautifully captures the rigors of his life, and life in the fast lane so to speak.<br />Fosse made only one film after All That Jazz and in a way it is a perfect curtain call for such an amazing man. Anyone interested in the business should definitely see this film, Fosse's official guide to, \\"Showtime.\\"
B00005JKCH|5.0|This was possibly the most highly-anticipated comic book movie adaptation ever, next to the X-Men, and it may have taken years to bring this about, but it is definitely worth the wait.  initially I wasn't sure who they were going to cast in the title role, but when I heard the name Tobey Maguire, I initially scratched my head in confusion, considering the fact that I would've never thought that a guy like him would take part in something like this, given his Hollywood track record.  But after this, I don't think I would picture anyone else as Peter Parker.  He really brings the character to life, embodying many of the deep qualities we love and admire from the comics and the cartoon, but in a majorly human way.  Kirsten Dunst was excellent as Mary Jane, I initially thought she would play Gwen Stacy, Spider-Man's FIRST love interest, but then I saw that Kirsten had dyed her hair, so it pretty much indicated that MJ was in this film.  this movie was excellent on so many levels, it was intelligent, it was funny, it was touching, it was dramatic, it was action-packed, everything you would love in a movie.  On top of that, it's Spider-Man for crying out loud!  Everyone loves that wall crawler.  I'm definitely excited about the sequels!

There's a few good things here, 2: \\"Darlin'\\" was a cute, bouncy hit single. \\"I'd Love Just Once to See You\\" is the best thing here: 2 minutes of homespun humor with a nice laff at the end. \\"Mama Says\\" is cute, & was taken from the end of the original SMILE version of \\"Vegetables.\\" \\"Let the Wind Blow\\" & \\"Country Air\\" R brief & eerie, definitely something different, sorta like \\"Be Still\\" & \\"Little Bird\\" on FRIENDS. & that's about all.... 2-1/2 STARS.<BR>The bonus tracks help: \\"Can't Wait Too Long\\" is a nice addition, but it & mosta the other bonus tracks U probly heard on the GOOD VIBES box-set. \\"You're Welcome\\" was the original \\"Heroes and Villains\\" B-side, & it's OK tho not stunning, an example of the kinda group chants Brian was reportedly creating at the dinner table back in those days.... Overall: 2-1/2 STARS +. Definitely strange, & worth a listen....
0440213525|3.0|Nice, compelling story, but the book drags on for too long. 460 pages is too much for this story. John Grisham should've told it in half the time. Sometimes repetitive. Certainly worth reading, but John Grisham has much better books (The Testament, The Brethren, A Painted House,...)
B00005QGAZ|5.0|What can I say about this album? What can anyone say? IT IS DEFINENTLY THE NUMBER 1 ALBUM THE WORLD HAS EVER SEEN IT STILL IS! If you have this album on record you havent heard it like this, AMAZING SOUND QUALITY!! If you dont have this album better get one it is a great item to have in any mj collection. <br />I LOVE YOU MJ!!
B00006J3T4|5.0|Mark has done it once again.  His ability to make a top flight album where his guitar shines is amazing.  He continues to take me to his music to new heights.  He blends Irish and southern US music together into a very tight album.  <br />His backup group is also superb, but I miss the addition of other vocalists like James Taylor and Van Morrison as he had on the last album, Golden Heart.  But the more I listen to this, the more it appeals to me.  Highly recommended.
B00005QGAV|5.0|Hi,<BR>I am a HUGE MJ LOVER and I think this is one of the best albums off all time!THe quality in this remastered album is unbelievable! This is definently a keeper for any Jackson collection.

B00005QGAX|5.0|I am a huge mj fan and this tops them all. This is probably the best album made from Michael Jackson.If you are familiar with this album and possibly have purchased this record you are in for a real surprise when you get this remastered edition. Not only is the sound quality great but it is packed with never before heard bonus features. This is definently a thumbs up for Michael and this album would definently make a great edition to any Jackson collection.
B000053VAF|1.0|This movie is vulgar and obscene. The humor is sexually explicit and very anti-Catholic. It blasphemes Judaism, Christianity and many other religions. <br />This movie is about as low as a major motion picture can get.
B00005Y228|5.0|...I wanted to check this cd out.  The two songs that are getting airplay now, are really good, but I wanted to hear more.  And the CD doesn't disappoint.  I'm REALLY into music, and I love finding a cd that makes me want to dance, and this cd does just that.  It combines mild disco with dance, and her voice is great!  Definitely check it out.
B00005LOUS|1.0|This movie is the worst remake, well, the worst movie of all time.  It takes the wonderful story of the Grinch and stretches too thin.  The acting, script and storyline are terrible.<br />Even without the comparison to the original, this movie can not stand on its own.<br />I could not finish watching this movie, it was that bad.  My friends watching it with me literally fell asleep.
B00005N83M|3.0|Alright.  I'll give it to ya, nice and honest.  There are alot of good songs on this cd, but...homegirl can't sing.  I'm amazed she even got a recording contract.  Gotta hand it to her though for coming up with some good tunes...they just should have used another vocalist.  I own this cd, and enjoy listening to it...I just have to cringe sometimes at her voice.  But overall...the music itself it pretty good.
B00000JLWW|1.0|I have said it before, and I'll say it again, Titanic, along with Gone With The Wind are two of the most OVERATED films in history, with no plot, stupid characters, and irritating dialoge!<BR> Think Romeo and Juliet aboard the Titanic and that best sums up this three hour plus film.<br />Titanic continues to be one of the biggest movies of all time, (why on Earth did moviegoers pick this mess to be a hit?) It involves a very spoiled and irritating girl known as Rose, played by Kate Winslet, who goes aboard a state of the art ship known as the Titanic with her snotty finacee, played by Billy Zane. She doesn't care for him so she hooks up with a drifter/artist named Jack played by Leonardo DiCaprio. The majority of the film is about Jack and Rose trying to avoid her fiancee while the ship itself hits an iceberg and sinks, killing many of the passengers aboard. The reason why so many teenage girls went crazy for this film is because it has a story that only a teenage girl could love with it's simplistic dialoge and cliched characters. I was hoping by the end that Rose herself would be hit by an iceberg as her character was really becoming annoying fast!<br />Now, what bothers many moviegoers is that instead of being about the ship itself and the people who died, the film focuses on another silly 90210 teen romance. We have seen this type of romantic film hundreds of times before, and the romance in Titanic is about as interesting as a can of flat soda.<br />While there are some nice costumes, and effects work done on the sinking of the ship, audiences must endure over two and a half hours of some of the most irritating and cliched dialoge ever written (&quot;I'm just a tumbleweed blowing through the wind?!&quot;) as well as a lot of boredom waiting for the ship to sink. I had to be woken up by my wife when the ship sank while seeing it on DVD (I never saw it in theaters, because no film could live up to that amount of hype and after finally seeing it on DVD, I was right) Everyone I have talked to says that seeing the movie on the big screen makes a bigger difference in the special effects, well I have a HDTV big screen and that's about as close to a motion picture screen you can get watching a home video DVD.<br />All in all, Rose isn't a woman searching for herself, but rather a spoiled brat looking for attention, and I never related to Jack one bit. I guess the only characters who I felt any real sympathy for were the captain and the ship's designer, as the film doesn't really focus on any of the real victims of the event other than the ficticious Jack and Rose.<br />I enjoy some of James Cameron's films, (True Lies and Strange Days, which he wrote, are two of the best action films of the 1990's!) But, Titanic wasn't the &quot;classic&quot; many have hailed it to be!<br />A 1 on a scale of 1-5. If you want to see a real film about the Titanic rent the original, not this awful mess!<br />Sure, most teenage girls will go crazy over this, but, I'll take Good Will Hunting anyday over this mess!<br />The Titanic DVD has no commentaries or any other &quot;goodies&quot; found in other premium DVDs, just the standard film in widescreen format, a couple of trailers and THAT'S IT! Thank goodness me and my wife rented rather than bought this film. If you absolutely must own this film, then, wait for a deluxe version DVD with a commentary and other features first!
B00005N83M|3.0|Can she do anything well but look pretty?  She's not a remarkably talented actress...she can't sing to save her life...now she's posing practically nude to sell perfume??  I mean, come on!  What she really needs to do is find her own identity and stop trying to be like everyone else.  I'm sure she'd get much more respect.  phew...i feel much better now.  But like i said in my earlier review...the music itself is good.  just try to block out her voice.
B00006F7S4|5.0|This sounds like the AM gold compilation.  Maybe think of a John Denver record, but atmospheric.  That sounds like a dis but it isn't.  Beck holds it down like that.  These songs were all written in the span of a few days, so this record isn't as schizophrenic as his other releases.  That isn't good or bad, but it is unique for a Beck record.  Also unique for a Beck record is a complete lack of irony.  Refreshing.  It should be noted that while this record was written after a breakup, the songs are not as depressing as some would tell you.  Sure, the songs lumber along at a glacial pace, and the lyrics are about loss and stuff like that, but the record comes across as pretty, not sad-sack.  This is some top shelf craft.
B00005U1YO|3.0|The Chemical Brothers. What can you say? In the world of electronica they are deified. To object to a Chemical Brothers is to not like the Beatles. But lets say you are more of a general listener, with eclectic tastes beyond just electronica, and say, you are curious as you have heard so much about the Bros. should you buy? Probably not. <br />Being a similar generalist, I must say of all the electronica (lets take the broadest genrre label here) discs I have bought in the last year, this one gets least play. There is something quite irritating about the whole endeavour. Bros. fanatics will say that I am too unhip, maybe. But truly, you will not be able to make it all the way through this disc. Whats the problem?<br />Its just not enjoyable--thats the problem, with the exception of the first two tracks. The Bros. are part of the art electronica crew, they glory in the different paths and ways of the electronic idiom, exploring this and that, blending this and that. But here the results are not satisfying. Each song sounds like an art school experiment, and there is not much heart there. The tracks are probably too eclectic to add up, here we go from ironic disco to Beth Orton ballad and back, and the reach exceeds the grasp.  Consequently, the set as a whole doesn't hang together either. <br />And although its meant to be arty and &quot;anti-cool&quot; there is quite a bit of plain cheesiness in the product that they have sifted out of electronica past, particularly 80s new wave synth pop. All in all, it just fails to make your any kind of hair stand on end. Getting through the entire set feels like some duty that you must perform, because, after all, they are the Chemical Brothers. you really want to appreciate it, but in the end, you turn it off. <br />Of course they are talented, brilliant, etc. but music has to deliver that special feeling, here it doesn't. So, non-devotees move on, or back, through the Chem Bros. catalogue.
B00005JKDQ|5.0|pixar is back again with another great computer aniamted movie, i really like this movie it's just a funny and wacky as toy story,i highly recommed this movie to anyone who has seen toy story 1 &amp; 2.
B00000IAU3|4.0|Alright so everybody was skeptical about Dido after working With everybodies &quot;favorite white rapper&quot; , but Dido moves so far above the little tease of stardom she showed with the Stan Single.<br />   Dido's are some of the most relaxing , soothing influences on a persons day you would think shes been singing to you for a long while, but thats just some of what makes this debut cd impressive, with solid Ballads, and bonafide singles (Hunter, Thank You) this cd is well worth every penny you spend on it.<br />    Songs like here with me stick with you.  This cd goes in to my cd player whenever I need relaxation, and that is worth it alone.
6305291446|4.0|I rate the Halloween series as follows, from best to worst:  (Please note, Halloween 8 is not out in Australia as yet)<BR>Halloween, Halloween 2, Halloween H2O, Haloween 4, Halloween 6, Halloween 5, Halloween 3.<BR>Halloween and Halloween 2 are far and away my favourite films in the series, with H2O easily third in line.  I just watched it for the 5th time - quite scary at times, some great parts, like Michael appearing under the dumbwaiter shaft brandishing his carving knife, the cry of pain when Josh Hartnett is stabbed in the leg, the sheer look of terror by Jamie Lee Curtis as she comes face-to-face with Michael separated only by a door.  Nice cameo by Janet Leigh, too.  I liked how Michael Myers almost exclusively used a carving knife.  I liked the start, when the clock ticked over to October 31st, the flashback to Halloween, etc.  I didn't like how (the late) Donald Pleasence's brief voiceover was redone by another actor, and I love L.L. Cool J as a rapper, esp. his early albums - not as a wise ass security guard.  If you haven't seen any Halloween movies, try renting 1,2 then H2O.
6300270432|5.0|Well, if this film doesn't put hair on your chest, nothing will. Look up 'film noir' in the dictionary and there should be a picture of Robert Mitchum in The Yakuza, alongside Bogie in The Maltese Falcon. It's that good of a film. The theme is  about honor, or  &#34;giri.&#34; The last bastion of manhood in an relativistic world ambivalent towards heroism, unsure about any values, moral or otherwise, and gone to hell. Against this background, you may be a tad on the shady side of the law, but do you keep faith with your friends? For that matter, would you risk taking a bullet for someone you  personally loathe but whom you &#34;owe&#34; because he's saved the life of your wife and child? The plot begins when Mitchum is approached by an old army buddy that he hasn't heard from in decades, save for the annual obligatory  Christmas card.  His daughter's been kidnapped by Japanese mobsters and he needs his help.  As to Mitchum, his character is established in one line. &#34;You've been successful?&#34; Mitchum: &#34;That depends on how you figure those things.&#34; True enough.  He has no family, no friends, no one even remotely close. The film noir loner, now in his sixties.  He goes back to Japan, links up with the only woman he ever loved, and the one enemy who can help him gain entry into the dark world of the Yakuza; an ultra-traditionalist latter-day Samurai ( Tanaka Ken ) who &#34;owes&#34; Mitchum. One small problem, he's no longer a Yakuza. He's been out of the mob for years. When Mitchum finds out this unpleasant bit of information and blurts out &#34;I can't ask you to do that!&#34;  Tanaka Ken quietly replies: &#34;You already have.&#34;  The aged warriors go to it again. A great story of love and betrayal. Acted in a style of understated whispers between flashing katanas that bring the house down.
6304493681|5.0|The effects in this movie will blow your mind, and this isn't just one of those &quot;blow up anything that moves&quot; type anime.This will actually make you stop and think when you finish watching it.
B0000640VN|3.0|Leopold (Hugh Jackman), Duke of Albany and renaissance man, is astonished by a man who is in a crowd with a miniature item, which he later stumbles across at his announcement party for his bride to be.  Leopold follows the man, Stuart (Liev Schreiber), and is pulled away from the 1870s into present time through a time portal.  In present time he meets Kate (Meg Ryan) who despises Stuart and is a successful and ruthless advertising representative.  Kate and Leopold is film that has some funny moments and witty dialogues, however, falls short in some aspects.  Overall, the film produces a feeling of deja vu.
630514415X|5.0|Spike Lee's latest, He Got Game, is among his best.<br />I must however issue a WARNING: He Got Game, like most of Spike Lee's works, is VERY SATIRICAL IN NATURE! That means it does contain steryotypes, exaggerated characters and rascism. If you are offended by this, or the sexual content which does appear, this movie is not for you.<br />Onwards, for those open-minded to this kind of thing, this is a great work of art. It features the Oscar winning Denzel Wasington (Training Day) as a convicted murderer who is released conditionally to please society. Basketball star Ray Allen plays Denzel's son, doing what he does best--play basketball. A profound yet entertaining movie, with a slight tinge of abstraction towards its end.<br />It is one of the few DVD gems I highly recommend for those not offended by the former.
0316666343|4.0|By now most people already know what 'THE LOVELY BONES' is about as it has been talked about to no end on various talk shows and been at the top of the bestseller list for almost the entire summer, so there is no need for me to give a synopsis of the plot in this review, it would probably be redundant. I, instead, would like to give you my opinion on this remarkably different book and comment on what others have said in their reviews. <br />I have noticed that while most people thoroughly enjoyed this book there are many people who called it sad and depressing. I guess that is in the eye of the beholder because I found it to be quite the opposite. I thought the story of Susie Salmon was a hopeful story about how life goes on after a loved one dies and the simple joys that we sometimes take for granted. I loved watching Lindsey, while trying to cope with her sisters death, try to start a life of her own and experience the things every teenager does such as her first kiss and starting high school. I also enjoyed watching her parents try to find a way to cope with the loss of their daughter in their own separate ways, it gives you hope. I thought Grandma Lynn was absolutely wonderful! When she arrived it was like a breath of fresh air and helped everyone to forget even if for only a little while. One of my favorite parts of this book was when Grandma Lynn first came to visit and gave Abigail and Lindsey makeovers at the kitchen table; it literally put a smile on my face. There are plenty of other parts of 'THE LOVELY BONES' that I found to be heartwarming but I don't want to give the whole book away :). In no way did I find 'THE LOVELY BONES' to be depressing, of course there are moments that are sad but mostly, in my opinion, it was hopeful.
B00005QGAT|5.0|I am a huge Jackson fan with Many of His Wonderful albums but this is one of my favorites.<BR>This is one of his first albums with his solo carreer and it only shows off a little of his talent. If you are familiar with the album off the wall you will have never heard it so clear! This is definently worth the money and is a great addition to any Jackson collection.

B00005YXZH|5.0|Nothing else sounds like this.  Everything is here and in place. It needs a couple listenings and you will see the light.  My vote for Album of the year.  <br />By the way, all the posers that wrote one star reviews were expecting what Resprise had in mind....Top Fourty Alternative ....  This is not Blink 182 Children! Has anyone else notice this?  NoneSuch Records has made a brilliant move!
