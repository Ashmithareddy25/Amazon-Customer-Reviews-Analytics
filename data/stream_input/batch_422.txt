B000002HRE|1.0|This album contains the songs that weren't considered good enough to be included on &quot;Load&quot;.  Whereas there were a couple of songs on &quot;Load&quot; that I thought were okay, I didn't like a single one of these.<br />If you're new to Metallica, I recommend &quot;Master Of Puppets&quot; or &quot;Ride The Lightning&quot;.<br />I have to add though: does anyone else find it ironic that a band that supposedly hates being labeled chose to name themselves METALlica?
B0002BO0AS|5.0|Unearth has finally released a full length L.P. and earned themselves a spot in the metal world with this effort.&quot;The Oncoming Storm&quot; will leave you with your jaw droppped and your head a banging. They have crafted a  mix of Gothenburg melody and old-school thrash metal remniscent of  Suicidal Tendencies or D.R.I. while staying true to their hard core roots.Adam Dutkuwiecz does a great job in producing this album as he adds his touch on old Unearth songs like &quot;Endless&quot; and &quot;Black hearts&quot; making them rock even harder.Ken Susi and Buz Mcgrath pummel your ear drums with breakdown after breakdown, ascending scales, appregios, and lightning fast riffs that would make some of the best metal guitar players jealous. Not to mention that Mike Justain is one of the best drummers in the scene today. My favorite new songs on this album are &quot;Failure&quot; &quot;This Lying World&quot;and &quot;Zombie Autopilot off&quot; Overall great album for people who enjoy real music. Five Stars
B000002H97|3.0|I was disappointed the first time I heard this, as were other people I knew.  This is also the point at which people starting accusing Metallica of selling-out.  Metallica countered by saying that it was the mainstream that was moving towards Metallica, and not vice-versa.  This is true -- but Metallica were more than happy to accomodate them.  I still remember being in a bookstore at the magazine rack looking at the cover of a magazine featuring Metallica and Guns 'N' Roses (whom they were on tour with at the time), and some girl coming up to me and striking up a conversation about how Metallica had sold out.<br />But anyway, this review is of the album, not the band itself.  There are some tracks on here that I thought were okay, but nothing fantastic.  If you're new to Metallica, I recommend &quot;Master Of Puppets&quot; or &quot;Ride The Lightning&quot;, two classics.<br />I have to add though: does anyone else find it ironic that a band that supposedly hates being labeled chose to name themselves METALlica?

B000002H33|5.0|Though many fans prefer &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot;, this is my favorite Metallica album.  &quot;Master of Puppets&quot;, &quot;Welcome Home (Sanitarium)&quot;, and &quot;Disposable Heroes&quot; are all highlights, as is &quot;Orion&quot;, my all-time favorite Metallica track.  Highly recommended.<br />I have to add though: does anyone else find it ironic that a band that supposedly hates being labeled chose to name themselves METALlica?
0312995423|3.0|For me, the hallmark of a Brown novel is that it is exactly as \\"Riveting!\\" and \\"Relentless!\\" as the back cover would have you believe. The chapters should be short bits concentrating on one storyline, each ending in a mini cliff-hanger so you roll from one chapter to the next trying to amass enough of a sense of resolution to put the book down for a while...but it never happens. THAT's Brown's narrative momentum and ***THAT's what is missing from Digital Fortress!***<br /><br />The characters are a bit drab and, as described above, the structure does not have the momentum of his other work. There is also a point at the end (when the big \\"reveal\\" happens to explain what is REALLY going on) when, as a reader, I felt like I was way ahead of him. He had already said enough to give away the twist, but I was forced to read 2 pages of conversation and cinematic details as the answers dawned on the characters and events played out. It was a terrible suspense killer right at the end of the book that left me with a sinking disappointment. NOT what I usually get from Dan Brown.<br /><br />BUT if you have read everything else Dan Brown and just want more, this one is fine but it might not meet your expectations after reading his other stuff.
B000002H6C|3.0|This was the first Metallica album I bought, and at the time I loved it, though now I don't think as highly of it.  A few of the songs I don't like too much, and the production is pretty bad (Jason Newsted's face is on the package, but chances are you won't be able to hear him).  If you're new to Metallica, I recommend &quot;Master Of Puppets&quot; or &quot;Ride The Lightning&quot; instead.<br />I have to add though: does anyone else find it ironic that a band that supposedly hates being labeled chose to name themselves METALlica?
0802130208|4.0|&quot;A Confederacy of Dunces&quot; has been one of my favotite books since we read it in my AP Literature class in High School.  I've read it twice since then and each time I find something new that I love about it. It's simply a shame that Toole left us with so few of his books.
B000002UDD|4.0|For awhile, this was my favorite Megadeth album, due in part to nostalgic reasons (it was my first Megadeth album).  I love the way this one sounds, it's got great production, and some great songs.  Jeff Young is overlooked as a great guitarist.  I love everything about this one -- even the cover (front and back!).  Recommended.
B000059QY3|5.0|This is the La Traviata as visualized by Verdi. Angela Gheorghiu IS Violetta Valery. I have seen this opera all my life, but never have I seen the equal of this performance. Sir Georg Solti and the rest of the cast, plus Gheorghiu, make this the La Traviata which you MUST have.
1558908323|5.0|The giant roaches are terrifying.  They're as gruesome and sinister as anything on the screen since the first ALIEN movie.  I hate, hate HATE bugs &amp; these guys were done so well here that I could barely watch - the filmakers should be very proud.<br />It did turn corny towards the end, but the whole story was excellent and exactly what I expected.  This may be Mira Sorvino's best work &amp; a must-see for people interested in B-Horror movies as an artform.  This isn't Shakespeare, but it's paint-by-numbers at the highest level.  I'm glad it was such a success with the sequels, etc.
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|This eponymous album from the Glaswegian quartet Franz Ferdinand is a clever, confident and dazzling debut. Its perfect blend of dispassionate vocals, jagged tight guitar licks, and smooth and irresistible disco beats recalls the confluence in the late-'70s/early '80s of rock, new wave, and disco, with shades of Blondie, Roxy Music, and Ultravox, plus a little Talking Heads and Gang of Four for good measure.  <br />If their music is derivative, it's in a good way. They have a fresh voice that combines indie rock recklessness with more polished influences. Meanwhile, their sharp black and white shirts and suits and their art-school references to Dadaist imagery and European history create a sophisticated image that contrasts dramatically with the calculated sloppiness and artlessness of many American indie bands. <br />I wouldn't call FF the saviors of rock, as some have suggested, but they do bring a much needed breath of fresh air to the modern music scene.
B0002234LS|4.0|This movie is very much like The Sixth Sense which I liked very much except for the very end. Johnny Depp gets right into character just as he always does and gives an excellent performance. Based on a Stephen King novel, it is one of the best that I've seen turned into a movie but I didn't read this book. Most of Kings movies suck, in my opinion but not this one. You will find yourself going back over parts in the movie, at least in your head, and saying: &quot;Now I See Why...&quot;
0803728484|4.0|Author Julia Donaldson acquired a faithful following of British readers when years ago she first penned her masterpiece, ?The Gruffalo?.  Unfortunately, America has yet to recognize this work formally and despite her numerous awards, Ms. Donaldson has not yet reached household name status in the States quite yet.  I decided to introduce myself to her work by reading a book that, to my mind, embodies silliness and morality twofold.  ?The Spiffiest Giant in Town? is, to be brief, about a spiffy giant.  And it?s top notch.<br /><br />Our hero in this tale is George the giant.  George lives in a small village that is an odd combination of fairy tale old and twenty-first century new.  In this particular village, giants are just ordinary citizens like anybody else.  It hasn?t escaped George?s notice that when it comes to clothing, he?s sorely in need.  Every day George wears the same old brown sandals and the same old-patched up gown (which looks like nothing so much as a linen dress).  Says George, ?I wish I wasn?t the scruffiest giant in town?.  One day, George sees that a store is selling giant sized clothing.  Delighted he purchases ?a spiffy shirt, a spiffy pair of pants, a spiffy belt, a spiffy striped tie?, and spiffy socks and shoes.  He leaves looking like an Assistant Bank Manager and soon he comes across a giraffe who?s missing a scarf.  George gives his tie to the giraffe to keep him warm then moseys out of town.  Next he sees a goat who?s lost his sail.  George?s shirt solves that problem forthwith.  You can see where this is going.  By the time everything is said and done George is severely depleted in terms of outerwear and his old clothes start looking a little less scruffy after all.  Better still, the animals he helped get together to show their appreciation, and George is undeniably lauded.<br /><br />First of all, I was delighted to discover that the opposite of ?scruffy? is ?spiffy?.  I mean, it makes perfect sense when you say it that way, but it isn?t one of those things they teach you in school.  George is such a likable hero that you?re rooting for him every step (and hop) of the way.  I was especially pleased to find that the little song he sings himself after every animal rescue, rhymes.  I can?t tell you how many books for kids I look through where even the simplest of rhymes either don?t work or are avoided altogether.  This story is about the rewards that come with simply making other people happy.  It?s a good strong message and one that I suspect too often gets lost in the shuffle of life sometimes.<br /><br />Honestly though?  I can?t claim that this book would have been even half the success that it is had it not been for artist Axel Scheffler.  Mr. Scheffler (also living in England at the moment) has a fine cartoony style that fits the action of this tale perfectly.  It's his details that make the book so great.  Like the fact that other giants live in the town (top and straw hats abound).  Or the fact that as George walks home in his clothes, his meticulously combed hair gets wilder and wilder and wilder.  There are lots of these tiny details in the story, and together they make it a fabulous read.  Could I have liked George half so much with a different artist?  Maybe.  But I wouldn?t count on it.<br /><br />In the end, the moral of this tale is that spiffiness comes in all kinds of sizes.  That sounds corny, but we?re dealing with a picture book here, people.  Let the corniness abound.  It?s just so pleasant to read a story like this that doesn?t condescend to its child audience and is a fun romp for parents as well.  If you?re the kind of person who upon seeing the word, ?Spiffiest?, in the title of a book, immediately wants to read it, this book is for you.  If that isn?t your reaction, good news.  This book is still for you.  Please feel free to take an inordinate amount of pleasure in it.  It'll do you a spot of good.of those things they teach you in school.

B0001Z52RU|5.0|This is such a good movie!  It makes you think, its got everything in it you can imagine and best of all you get to watch Ashton get PUNK'D over and over and over again!  Dont be fulled by the hokey cover of this DVD, It really is good!
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|I hadn't heard anything by Avenged Sevenfold until about a month ago when I downloaded &quot;Eternal Rest&quot; from their website, just to see if they had any talent. For some reason (perhaps it was how they were marketed) I was expecting a generic harcore punk band. I couldn't possibly have been more mistaken. A7X blends classic metal in the style of Metallica with modern hardcore in the style of Mudvayne plus some touches all their own for a sound that will completely blow you away. A few dowloads later, I came to the conclusion that I had to own Waking the Fallen. And so should any fan of metal or hardcore. If you're not sold on them yet, go to [...] download the four songs they have there, and you will be.
B000002UAO|5.0|Much if not all of what I'd have to say about this delightful album has already been said (probably to death) by the hundreds of reviewers who have beaten me to this site. But this really is great stuff -- catching the Fab Four in transition from radio-driven singles &quot;hits&quot; toward musical artistry and maturity.<br />In my opinion, the weakest song by far is &quot;What Goes On,&quot; essentially because I passionately dislike country-western music and cannot abide Ringo's obvious infatuation with such sounds especially in the early to mid-60s. But it is far more than compensated for by McCartney's &quot;Drive My Car&quot; (which begins so stunningly) and Lennon's amazingly haunting &quot;Norwegian Wood,&quot; &quot;Nowhere Man&quot; and &quot;In My Life.&quot; Lennon could have never written another song and his legacy would have been secure on the strength of those three pieces alone. (Fortunately he wrote many other good ones!)<br />Harrison was clearly beginning to flex his songwriting muscles here too, with &quot;Think for Yourself&quot; and &quot;If I Needed Someone&quot; both adding thoughtful and singable critiques of pop romance.<br />In many ways, this has been my favorite Beatles album for over three decades because it moves at the cusp of the relative innocence of the Beatles' earlier work and the edgier, more artsy, more electric and studio-layered music that followed, e.g., &quot;Revolver,&quot; &quot;Sergeant Pepper's&quot; and &quot;Abbey Road&quot; -- all of which, to be sure, also merit ratings of 5 for their own reasons. Most of those reasons, though, finally are rooted in the fact that the synergy of Lennon, McCartney and Harrison was virtually a gift to the world and will likely never again be matched in the annals of popular song.

B00003CXCT|2.0|How can you change what made these movies great to begin with?  It's like me getting a nose job after 50 years of having the one I've got.  People are going to notice.  I have the originals on vhs and will keep them instead replacing them with overdone effects.  Too bad so sad.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|Brave New World (2000) is the first Iron Maiden studio album with Bruce Dickinson on vocals since 1992's Fear of the Dark, and the first Maiden album with Adrian Smith on guitar since 1988's Seventh Son of a Seventh Son.  Retaining guitarist Janick Gers (whose Maiden debut was 1990's No Prayer for the Dying) and longtime guitarist Dave Murray, Iron Maiden now features a \\"three axe attack.\\"  Rounding the rhythm is founder Steve Harris on Bass, and Nicko McBrain on drums.<br />The Wicker Man - 100% Brave New World starts off with an instant classic!  The Wicker Man is easily one of my favorite Iron Maiden songs, and features an excellent solo from Adrian Smith.  This is Iron Maiden's triumphant return to the top!<br />Ghost of the Navigator - 100% With a building intro and that crashes into the verse, this song is head-banging heaven, and by now, any doubts that Iron Maiden could ever re-capture their former glory are laid to rest.<br />Brave New World - 100% The first three songs on Brave New World are one heck of a winning streak.  Brave New World starts slow, and builds into a made-for-concert sing-a-long chorus.  The title track builds into quite a heavy track, featuring great performances by the entire band.<br />Blood Brothers - 100% Iron Maiden is really on a roll.  Blood Brothers, the only track on Brave New World penned exclusively by Steve Harris, slows things down a bit.  Said to be written about his late-father, this song is emotionally charged, and features some great vocals by Bruce.  The last solo, by Janick Gers, is one of my favorite moments of the entire album, it just carries the song forward so perfectly.<br />The Mercenary - 90% This song charges forward at a feverish pace, completely forgetting our few minutes of slow down with Blood Brothers.  While this song doesn't quite live up to the standards of the first four, it's still quite good.<br />Dream of Mirrors - 85% I've really grown to dislike this song over the course of listening to this album.  It suffers from the same things that made The X Factor (1995) and Virtual XI (1998) so un-enjoyable... the song wanders on aimlessly, and is too repetitious.  While there is some really good music here, the lyrics are just repeated over, and over, and never really go anywhere.  If this song were 3 or 4 minutes shorter, it would've been a lot stronger.<br />The Fallen Angel - 80% This isn't what I'd call a clunker, but it's still not very good.  It sounds very similar to The Mercenary, it's just not quite as good.<br />The Nomad - 60% Nomad only earns 60% because it's got some good instrumentation.  It's otherwise a pointless, wandering song, suffering the same fate as Dream of Mirrors.  It's rumored that three or four songs on Brave New World were leftovers from Virtual XI, I'm guessing this song, and Dream of Mirrors are two of them.  The lyrics, and overall theme of this song, are quite frankly, pretty stupid.  I'm glad this song was never played live.<br />Out of the Silent Planet - 95% - Thankfully, things really pick back up with Out of the Silent Planet.  While the lyrics aren't anything to celebrate over, there is some good music here, and a great guitar intro by Janick.  This song, the second single from Brave New World, is fast paced, in your face Iron Maiden.<br />The Thin Line Between Love and Hate - 100% This is an ultimate closer.  While it's not really in the vein of the traditional Iron Maiden epic closer of the 80's, it's still quite good.  This is hands down one of Bruce's best vocal performances of his career, and there's some good three axe attackin' here too.<br />Brave New World, along with 2003's Dance of Death, are quite simply two of the best Iron Maiden albums ever.  I highly recommend Brave New World for someone just getting into Maiden, a lot of the songs are pretty easy to listen to and quite enjoyable.  The only thing I'd change about this album is The Nomad and The Fallen Angel, both of which would've been better suited as quite decent b-sides to the two singles from this album.  If you like these songs, be sure to pick up Rock in Rio (2001) on either CD or DVD, because there's eight or so (going by memory here) Brave New World, and some of them, like the title track, shine even more live than in the studio.
140003180X|3.0|I had been meaning to finish this book for a while. It was good. I liked it but didn't love it. This is the fourth in The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency series. What made the first few so enjoyable (the simplicity of the story/characters/mysteries) suddenly felt dull to me in this installment. So I tossed to book aside with only about 50 pages left to finish, not really caring whether or not Mma Ramotswe got married or whether or not any of the cases got resolved. I did go back to it over the weekend simply because I was in dire need for something to read and couldn't figure out which book I wanted to crack into. In the end: Happy Botswana Ending. Was I expecting anything different? The next one in the series, Full Cupboard of Life, sounds just as exiting as the rest: Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni installs a new seatbelt into Mma Ramotswe's van, Mma Makutsi's new house will have running water, everyone drinks a lot of bush tea. Alexander McCall Smith is a wonderful storyteller but his books should be reserved for when you're coming out of a depression and want something simple and happy to read.
B000000OSG|4.0|Civil War, Estranged and the alternate version of Don't Cry are all classic songs. It may have more filler than UYI 1 but i think it has more killer songs...
0316168815|1.0|This book is a hoax.  Simply a sappy childish fantasy in the guise of adult literary fiction.  Sebold often comes up with clever metaphors and imagery, but her characters persist in their flatness and incongruity.  Each character jumps right out of some \\"after-school special\\" mold, and the little quirks Sebold ascribes to some of them (Ruth's \\"Sixth Sense\\", Ray's <BR>\\"exotic\\" Indian heritage) are cheap tricks.  The characters act in ways no rational person would given the circumstances: the father pressing the surviving daughter Lindsey to go explore that den of murder, the mother having an affair with the detective investigating her daughter's death, Susie having wanton unprotected sex with a junior high crush who doesn't even seem concerned about this supernatural soul transfer, as if it happens all the time.  Give me a break!  <BR>The ending is so ludicrously sentimental and facile that you really do believe it was written by a fourteen year old girl and illustrated with colored pencils, as she prouldly showed it off to her uncritical mother.  \\"You did such a good job, Alice, you budding little writer, you!\\"
B00008J4P5|5.0|Many people yet to listen to Elephant may believe that the claim of this album being one of the best ever made may be ridiculous or even just plain ignorant. You must listen to this album. The White Stripes made three very good stripped down garage rock records prior to Elephant but this is BY FAR the best yet. Every song will surprise you because they range from blues to country to punk to straight up Led Zeppelin rock. AMAZING! That is the only word that can sum up the first note of Seven Nation Army to the very last note of the closing track, It's True That We Love One Another. Jack White even pulls off amazing solos wich sound like the electricity is actually flowing through his fingers. The really cool thing is that the White Stripes recorded the whole thing without computers and using only back-to-basics equipment. Some skeptics point out the fact that Meg White's drumming is minimalistic which is true. However this never seems to dawn on you while listening to Elephant because the songs are just too good. In fact the simplicity mixed with the great influences of Jack White as well as his knowledge of music and sheer talent are what makes the record so great and at times so beautiful. The White Stripes are the closest thing my generation has to a legendary band such as Led Zeppelin. I realize that many people need to develope a liking to this band because of the complete junk we are used to and are fed by MTV and others. Don't miss out on this album and this band. I purchased this album in April of 2003 and I am still listening to it regularly now in the summer of 2004. Great songs. Great album. Great band. Elephant is not an album, it is a work of art.

0066620996|5.0|Good to Great is definitely a book that can be recommended to anyone.  The concepts and ideas are easy to grasp and applicable to a wide variety of situations faced in our every day professional and personal lives.  Some of the concepts are even humorous, but they challenge your mind by being surprising and refreshing at the same time.  You might not agree with all of the concepts, but you will definitely get a chance to look at things from a different and renewed perspective.
0385510446|4.0|What makes this novel so enjoyable is that it's more than just a Grisham novel. And it's still just a Grisham novel. The author has taken the best elements of his previous work and combined them for The Last Juror, those of courtroom drama and rural Southern mores. I was pleasantly surprised to be reading about one man's experiences and friendships in a small Southern town rather than a complex legal thriller that raced to the end. Such a story was no less compelling than previous Grisham novels. And being a Southerner myself made it all the more fun and relatable. This is a very good read!
B000002HEP|5.0|This is kyuss at their best.<br />Sky valley is whne the band finally mastered their psychedelic side that was hinted at on &quot;Blue for the Red Sun.&quot; The instrumentals on Sky valley are leaps and bounds better than those on &quot;blues.&quot;<br />But unfortuneately, not every song on Sky valley is an instrumental. <br />AS you should know by now, sky  valley is divided into three suites. I really dont bother listening to the third one, being that it's rather dull. <br />The first two songs of the first suite, and the entire second suite, however, are what make this cd worth any price of admission. <br />&quot;Gardenia&quot; is a kyuss in true form, and at the top of their game. Its heavy, and got groove to spare. The solo breakdown is a tad long, but its still good. &quot;Asteroid&quot; is the first instrumental on Sky Valley. It's a space-y ditty that truely deserves its title and is worth of a spot in the pantheon of kyuss's best work. <br />&quot;Super Scoopa and the mighty scoop&quot; is alright, but theres just too many fricking false stops. its annoying. <br />The Second suite starts of with &quot;100 degrees,&quot; its short, concise and rocks like green machine. It goes right into my favorite kyuss song, and one of my favorite songs of all time, &quot;Space Cadet.&quot; THis song is soo good because its so unexpected. The instrumentation, vocals, the song writing,  and indeed every aspect of this song is perfect. Then Comes &quot;Demon Cleaner,&quot; a sort of mellowish song that is a perfect finale for the second suite.<br />As previously stated, i dont listen much to the third suite. I mean, how you can top the second suite of this cd? its nigh impossible. And that maybe the only place sky valley faulters. You cant listen to anything after &quot;demon cleaner.&quot; Theres just no humanly way possible to maintain the amount of quality presented previously, so you just gotta stop it. <br />Dont get me wrong, the songs in the third suite are good, but its like being offered a cheeseburger after eating a great steak (or something like that). <br />So yea. <br />Blues for the red is Kyuss's second album, and is highly regarded as their best, but i tend to think that sky valley is kyuss at their best. But id reccomend new fans start at blues then go from there.
0694003611|4.0|I first read this book when my son was a year old.  The simple words and colorful illustrations made it one of his favorite bedtime rituals.  The book focuses on a little rabbit going to bed and saying \\"good night\\" to everything in his room as well as the moon outside.  In addition to reading the book, I would ask my son to point to the things the rabbit was saying \\"Good Night\\" to. Especially finding the little mouse on every color page.  (I believe he's on everyone). We used it like an identification game as well as a story. Simple words that rhyme like \\"Hush\\" and \\"Mush\\"  are easy for little ones to learn and repeat. <BR> An interesting aspect of the illustrations is that the room is drawn darker as the book nears its end. The magic was still there the other night when I read it to my son who is now 3 and a half.   Like other books by this author, there is an essentially childlike quality coupled with that \\"hard to pin down\\" quality of a classic.
B000001FA4|5.0|I just want to concur with the reviewer below.  This is their best period and best album.  The Amazon.com reviewer that said 4th of July and Elvis Presley and America were bad songs obviously did not listen to those songs to completion.  The thing about Presley's melody is that it is understated.  The beauty of the melody is brought out by Edge's guitar work at times.  It's far from a bad song and maybe my favorite on &quot;Fire&quot;.  U2 never sounded better.  Enjoy the whole album!
0790744295|4.0|This is, for me, the best short story horror film i seen so far. I seen a good amount, i am not going to say all but i seen enough to know what is good and not good. This is the best. I love all the stories, some have there weak moments but the one wih the moster in the box and the roaches are the best. I dont want to type a lot but pure in simple this movie is a good rental and worth 10 or 15 bucks in my book.
158799190X|1.0|I came to this book with a very favourable prejudice. I was utterly disappointed. Too Bad. The author makes a good point: we are bad at understanding the role of randomness in our lives. Unfortunately, the substance stops there. No idea is developed, no valuable information transmitted. The whole book could easily fit on a single page. The rest is just boring blabla. Taleb`s ostentatious narcissism is also annoying. The author spends much of the book writing about how cultured he is. <br />The author claims that he never reads reviews. I sure hope he reads this one.<BR>  <BR>Don`t buy this book.
B0001MDP3G|2.0|I gave this film two stars, one for Kidman the other for Zellwigger, as for the story itself the brutality of Inman's odysseian journey back to Ada overwhelms their unbelievable romantic attachment to each other.  Director Minghella fails utterly in making their love come convincingly to life in the way David Lean did with Yuri and Lara in \\"Dr Zhivago\\", so the viewer is subjected to one horrific episode of brutality after another without the reward of  genuine fulfillment at the end, and ironically it is Ada who lures Inman into his journey of ultimate self-destruction with her letter pleading with him to desert and come back to her.  At the conclusion I felt only revulsion at the detailed portrayal of the brutalities and emptiness for Ada and Inman.
0385720920|5.0|First and foremost if it wasn't for the movie fight club i would have never heard of Chuck Palahniuk.  Now I have read several of his books.  His original writing and story telling are for a lack of a better word awesome.  Choke is a story of a young man who is broke from keeping his mother in a nursery home.  He goes to Diners and fakes choking and whoever saves his life is forever in debt to him, so he constantly asks for cash.  Between that and his job at a colonial fair he couldn't have a worse life, or could he?
0060930187|5.0|No matter your age or background, if you have ever felt alone, you can relate to this book.  The Bell Jar is the story of a girl fresh out of college trying to find peace of mind and happiness.  The beginning of the book tells of her slow discovery that everything she has ever wanted-and is now on the verge of getting-do not mean as much as she thought.  As her dreams seem to crash down around her, she feels her bell jar descend, sending her into a state of loneliness and madness.  The beauty of The Bell Jar is that the author's feelings come through so honestly that the reader feels like he or she is sitting across from a friend, listening to their story.  The story not only draws sympathy from the reader, but causes an assessment of one's own dreams and fears.  The Bell Jar is not a story to read and forget.  It mirrors real life inner-quarrels and leaves the reader with a sense of hope.  No matter what the bell jar is, it can be overcome.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|This was one of the best movies i have ever seen but you have to be good at listening and remembering and figuring out things and paying attention. This is a great movie much great effort has been put into it. Bravo!
1400032717|5.0|Upon finishing this book, it quickly made it into my &quot;Must Reads of a Lifetime&quot; list. Haddon is a genius. He has created the complex and fascinating life of Christopher, a young man with the mysterious condition of autism. Haddon worked with autistic children and knows something of their experience. One is amused, frustrated, challenged, and inspired by Christopher's life-coping rituals. Rituals which he uses to help him through a journey. A journey which, although Christopher's path is different from most, is a search for the happiness we all seek.
B0001ZX0OW|5.0|This movie is very different from anything I've seen.  It is a movie that is not made to entertain, but instead it makes us think by challenging our views and ideals.  It is definitely not the typical hoopla Hollywood usually turns out; it is a pleasant surprise about a few subjects that are not-so-pleasant.  It is the kind of movie that you can't say you liked without explaining why, as it is a dark movie without a neatly tied up ending.<br />This movie examines stereotypes and subtly questions the bonds that tie us and the values we live by.  As the credits roll, the viewer realizes this film has no happy ending or a resolution and instead it leaves you with questions and outrage.<br />In addition to a complex and interesting story, this movie also has incredible writing, directing, and acting.  The movie and the story manage to be both emotionally touching and emotionally revolting.<br />I highly recommend this movie.  However, if you don't like movies with a dark tone to them, you should avoid this one.
B00005JKN9|5.0|I do not no what came over me back in July when I insulted this woderful movie, I do not hate this movie and I do not I repeat do not hate the 21st century, I love, I repeat I really really<BR>love the 21st century including the movies which are Almost Famous, Lord Of The Rings Trilogy, A Beautiful Mind, In The Bedroom, The Pianist, Chicago, Master And Commander, Mystic River, and Lost In Translation. I also love the nice alternative<BR>music like Linken Park, people are really nice in this decade, and best of all the 21st century includes the great things like DVD players and the internet, which are stuff that the crappy decade the 1980's did not have. Thank God we live in the 21st century with the DVD players and Internet and of course the great great movies I just mentioned. TV also is better now than it was in the 1980's, now we have kick ass HBO shows like Deadwood, The Sopranos, and Six Feet Under, Tales From The Crypt<BR>is also excellent. Truth be told, when I was insulting Gangs Of New York back in the July Of 2003, when I said no films of of past decades were gratuitous in violent content, I was talking about Martin Scorsese's films not anybody else's, I thought Bringing Out The Dead another excellent Scorsese film. Back During Than I was trying to get back at my friends for insulting<BR>Martin Scorsese's past films, so I insulted their favorite films<BR>to make a point, but I just realized I should not have done that<BR>for I really really really love I repeat love the 21st century, I only wanted them to realize that Scorsese has done many excellent of past decades, you see they were insulting his past films but just praising Gangs Of New York, Do not get me wrong<BR>I praise and love Gangs Of New York just as highly as my friends, but do not put down his past films, they should not make lies like his past films were gratuitous in objectionable<BR>content, for they were not I repeat not gratuitous and Gangs Of<BR>New York I repeat is not gratuitous in objectionable content. You want to talk objectionable gratuitous content take Rambo for example and the flicks of Chuck Norris and Van Demme, the violence in those flicks are gratuitous and are also Grade B<BR>exploitation. They should insult those dumb Stallone, Norris, and Van Demme flicks of the horrible horrible decade the 1980's instead of bashing Scorsese, he is a master and shoots violence<BR>in a realistic manner like Hollywood greats Sam Peckinpah, Francis Ford Coppola, Akira Kurosawa, John Woo, James Cameron,<BR>Peter Jackson, and Guillermo Del Toro. Martin Scorsese is a genius filmmaker and almost all of his films I love, Including his crowning achievement Raging Bull. This is Daniel Day Lewis third best performance, his first two are My Left Foot and In The Name Of The Father, which were both directed by Irish filmmaker Jim Sheridan (In America). I felt so much better, when<BR>I came back on this site and did my first apology by doing a five star review of Gangs Of New York, for I felt bad that I insulted a film I really really loved. I would not have let this<BR>film go home empty handed, I would have given this film best supporting actor for Daniel Day Lewis. Change his actor nomination to best supporting actor nomination and give him the<BR>best supporting actor oscar instead of Chris Cooper for the really really disappointing and horrible Adaptation directed by Spike Jonze and starring Nicholas Cage, I deeply hated Adaptation but I deeply loved Gangs Of New York. Anybody visiting Amazon.com If you see my July 2003 review of Gangs Of New York ignore that, I mean ignore that, I did not mean any <BR>of the hateful things I said about the movie, I only said it to make my friends stop bashing his other classic films. PLease this review is what I really think of Gangs Of New YOrk and I love I mean love Gangs Of New York and I love I mean love the 21st century and I love just love the movies from the 21st century and the music, TV, Internet, and DVD players which are all from the 21st century. Forget about what I said in my July 2003 review of Gangs Of New York. The review I am writing right now is the truthful one and I am telling the truth when I say I love everything from the 21st century including movies, music, the internet, and DVD's. Please believe what I just said. The 21st century is great. The 1980's is horrible. The 21st century <BR>is great and I love 21st century technology including it's movies, music, and the technolgy like the internet and DVD players. I love I repeat just love the 21st century.
055357342X|5.0|I have tried to read other fantasy novels and just couldn't get into them, but I checked this out at the library on a fluke &amp; was hooked!! I have read each book at least twice, and this last book is by far my favorite of the 3. I actually had the jaw drop thing going on in a few places! It is so well written, with attention to details &amp; descriptions, that the characters become endearing to you. I love Tyrions wit, Aryas spunk, and Jons quiet resolve, and a favorite of mine in this last book was Jamie &amp; Brienne. I cannot wait until The Feast for Crows comes out. I am already on the waiting list at the library, and its on my Christmas wish list!! If you want a good read, please try this one, the series is so popular at our house we give them as gifts!!
B0002I831S|5.0|I started my collection of Star Trek DVDs with ST movies set. But I always wanted to buy all the TOS episodes. But since they were quite costly (...), I restrained myself. But now that they are released in seasonal boxed sets I can buy the whole series. I have also got complete DS9 and 3 seasons of Voyager. But nothing beats the Original Series in either content or features or packaging. Thanks to Paramount, we can buy this series with great features. Buy it folks, before it runs out. You certainly would not be dissapointed.
0060589272|3.0|This novel is different from the former works of Coelho. His books so far have been easily read, tale like self-help books.  In his new novel, his writing style is still quite simple, almost in spoken language however he chooses to be explicit and graphic to create the intensity of scenes.  He tries to be provocative and tries to enter a territory he has not before.  The subject is serious and sometimes disturbing but he chooses to make it a tale and end it as a tale again, therefore weakens his plot.
B0000AMRJC|1.0|I Hate The 1980's, The clothes were cheap, the music was cheesy,<BR>and their was too much greed. These are the three reasons why the 1980's was terrible. This is a pointless remake that cares<BR>more about gratuitous violence rather than believable humane characters and a coherent plot. Al Pacino's Cuban accent is so<BR>embarrasingly laughable and phony that it looks more like a Saturday Night Live sketch rather than true Hollywood acting.<BR>You can't feel any sympathy for his mobster character Tony Montana, he is such an arrogant greedy jerk, who treats women in<BR>such a distasteful manner especially his scenes with Michelle Phieffer and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, who plays his sister.<BR>Hollywood five star classics like Raging Bull, The first two Godfather films, and The Wild Bunch are great films that deal with anti-heroes, but you symphatsize with the characters in those films, for they are more than just violence, they have a great deal of substance which includes believable and humane characters, and a considerable amount of plot. This is not even a gangster film, this is not even an anti-drug film, this is a piece of garbage that should not have been made this way. The 1980's was horrible in music, clothes, and personality concerning greed, their were better movies in that decade than this piece of trash. Thank God I live in the new millenium and not in the stupid 1980's which had no internet and DVD players.<BR>The millenium is great for we have technology that's awesome like the internet and DVD players, which the 1980's did not have. If you want director Brian De Palma's best see The Untouchables and Carrie, you want screenwriter Oliver Stone's best film see Platoon and Born On The 4th Of July, in which he was a director by then, you want Al Pacino's best film see Francis Ford Coppolla's The Godfather And The Godfather Part II,<BR>you want Michelle Phieffer's best film see Stephen Frears Dangerous Liasions and Martin Scorsese's The Age Of Innocence,you want Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio's best film see James Cameron's The Abyss, trust me you will be way better off. Despite the fact the 1980's had great films, it had it's share of bad films and the music, clothes, and greed of the 1980's were horrible. I hate the 1980's.
B0001AP12G|3.0|This cd was pretty good. But people, the best song on the cd is &quot;Through The Wire.&quot; This is the song that got it all started for kanye.
B00005JMFQ|2.0|This is one of the most cloying, sickeningly precious films I think I've ever seen.  If you can get through the first ten minutes without cringeing, you might actually like \\"Love, Actually.\\"  If not, you're in for a sticky ride, full of so many wince-inducing \\"awwwww\\" moments that I thought I was watching the film adaptation of a line of a Hallmark cards.  And for a film purporting to be about love, there isn't one single honest human emotion on display.  And there hasn't been an all-star cast playing such witless wanks since Burt Reynolds and \\"The Cannonball Run.\\"  Bill Nighy alone is hysterically funny, hence the two stars.  \\"Love, Actually\\" is \\"Dreadful, Actually\\" in every possible way.
0684857219|5.0|Great reference book for anybody who is serious about fitness or body building.
0380715430|2.0|This book is a quick read -- entertaining and light -- but no one should trust the facts that are tossed around in it.  Bryson's knowledge of languages other than English is shaky at best, and he makes countless mistakes in his various attempts at translation.  He also has a very superficial understanding of grammar (as evinced by Chapter 9).  On p. 142, he claims that petroleum has both Latin and Greek roots, &quot;(Latin petro + Greek oleum),&quot; but it is the opposite: petra is Greek and oleum is Latin.  Not a big deal of course, but this book is literally peppered with inaccuracies such as this one.  I wish someone had fact-checked this book, because it could have been a valuable tool.  As it is, the information is often imprecise, or just plain wrong.
B000002J09|5.0|All right. I read this review that said that Led Zeppelin sucked and that -get this- Avril Lavigne was better. For the love of god, some people have no brains at all. It's one thing to not like Led Zeppelin, but to say that they suck and that other greats like Jimi Hendrix and Eddie Van Halen suck, well that's just plain stupidity. And who told you that Jimmy Page was a computer?
B0000089A1|5.0|I admit I am a huge Kinks fan - I have heard all their music and own most of it.  I own Ray's &quot;movie&quot; Return to Waterloo and Percy, the film the Kinks perform Ray's soundtrack for. I have seen them perform several times and read their books.  I am biased, so I will not compare this album to any other band and will simply say it is the best Kinks CD of all.  If you want to hear the Kinks at their best - this is it!
B00005JLK1|2.0|Thirteen Ghosts director Steve Beck returns to helm this Dark Castle flick which begins with an awesome display of makeup and digital trickery and a foreboding atmosphere, but the plot is loaded with cliches and is rather predictable who's going to get picked off next.  When an ocean liner, missing for the past 40 years, mysteriously re-appears, a salvage crew (led by Gabriel Byrne) is offered to bring her in.  Ghost Ship's presentation is slick to be sure, and I really wanted to like this movie, but it leaves you wanting so much more out of it.  The cast also includes ER alumni and off-screen partners Julianna Margulies and Ron Eldard, as well as Wrong Turn's Desmond Harrington, Isiah Washington, and Karl Urban who looks like he just walked off the set of Lord of the Rings (which he most likely did).  All in all, this is worth a look for horror buffs, but don't expect anything special.
0131103628|5.0|Often refered to simply as K&amp;R, this book is the standard by which other technical books are judged. Written by the authors of the language, it is one of those rare books that combines brevity with clarity. It is a combination of an excellent tutorial book and a clear reference manual, and it also has a very useful index. This book has it all!<br />I refer to this book all the time and so does every professional C programmer I know. It's worth every penny.<br />If you are doing Unix/Linux programming the next book to get  is &quot;Advanced Programming in the UNIX(R) Environment&quot;<br />by W. Richard Stevens.
0375758992|1.0|I read this book for my book club.  It just seemed to meander through her childhood, no real plot or climax.  Yes, this girl definitely had a different type of childhood, but what makes it that interesting or significant?????
B00023BLXK|1.0|I cant believe some of the reviews I'm reading here.I was given the promo disc along with a bunch of others and decided to check out the reviews to decide whether it was worth watching or not.<BR>Well...according to the reviews here it was the best movie ever made, fantastic plot, beautiful love story, etc,etc.<BR>WHAT NONSENSE.......it was one of the most shallow excuses for a sequel I have ever seen. Patrick Swayze was the only redeeming factor for the 4 mins or so he was in the movie.<BR>Granted, some of the dancing was good but the girls parents, supposedly ex-champions, couldn't even dance. The editor was at great pains to ensure we didn't see them dance properly and the actors in the black and white footage of the parents dancing were obviously not the same as the \\"on-screen\\" actors.<BR>All in all a waste of time other than the championship dance scenes.
6300182266|1.0|I just received news that the new Battlestar Galactica series will NOT have the space battle scenes involving the Colonial Empire and the Cylons.In fact,the Cylons may not be seen at all.EXCUSE ME?The space battle scenes in the original series is what drew in the fanbase and now Mr Moore is destroying the main storyline.Attention Glen Larson,please come back and take control of your creation before it sinks like the Titanic.I am working on my own space war epic and there are space battle scenes and other confrontations between the heroes and the bad guys the fans will enjoy.I may join the millions of fans in sticking to the original,or if I win the billion dollars in the Pepsi Cola contest,I will try to buy the rights of Galactica and keep it the way it was.
B000024D4R|5.0|Animals was composed by the members of Pink Floyd during a time of economic and social unrest in England.  The Orwellian cover depicting the harrowing factory with a pig hovering over the smokestacks is one of my favorite album covers of all time.  The track listing obviously alludes to the novel Animal Farm.<br />&quot;Pigs on the Wing&quot; are both excellent ways to begin this album it presents a sense of comfort when trying to digest the ten minute plus epics that make up the middle of the album.  Throughout the album the lyrics are cynical and full of anger.  Animals also contains David Gilmour's best work as a member of Pink Floyd.  His outro solo on Pigs (Three Different Ones) is the most rockin solo in any Pink Floyd song and his rhythm work is interesting, masterfully complementing Richard Wright's keyboard part and Waters' Bass lines. The song Sheep is driven by a hypnotic bass line similar to &quot;One of These Days&quot; on Meddle.  Overall Sheep has an apocalyptic feel to it and is a great way to end the album.
B0002DB52M|5.0|Every once in a while a film comes along that is so wonderfully innovative, so exciting, so perfectly paced, so beautifully judged that it's impossible to look away. I've NEVER been a fan of Ms. Kidman's. I think she may be the most over-hyped actress of this generation, but, here she may finally have justified some of that hype; she has finally been given something interesting to do. <BR>I won't waste your time with a synopsis here. A large number of my fellow customers have taken care of that for me. I just want to make a couple of points.<BR>Despite sentiments expressed here that the film is Anti-American, it's not. Note the tagline...In a town not far from here... If it really was, would he have been able to round up(with the exception of Kidman)a cast completely made up of this brilliant bunch of American actors? Sadly, human cruelty is universal. And therein lies the point Von Trier is trying to make. For those who missed that point, I can only recommend a repeat viewing. <BR>It's not 3 hours long either. It's just over 2. But like DANCER IN THE DARK & ZENTROPA, when a film is as uniquely delivered as this one, who cares? I must admit that at one point, I felt the film started to drag. It was at that point that, like magic, Von Trier literally speeds up the action. Like I said, beautifully judged.<BR>As I was watching DOGVILLE, I realized(& this is something you don't see enough)that the true star of this film is the one person you can't see. Lars Von Trier. I can't wait to see what he does next.....
B000099T2L|4.0|I am so very sick of Beyonce at this point because they killed all her songs.Her first single \\"Crazy In Love \\" wasn't really that good anyway.Jay-z made it better.And when she dance her dress is shaking for her.All her other singles was good.But I really got tried of her performing everywhere especially the same songs.<br />And I really don't know why she win about 2 awards at every show she attend.I believe she is not the only gifted female snger.They should give awards to some new people.

B0002I831S|5.0|Back in the early 90s, I managed a video store which carried primarily VHS tapes.  Back then, it was George Lucas who was raking everyone over the coals with multiple releases of the Star Wars Trilogy--first Dollby, then remastered THX, then wide-screen versions, then remastered THX wide-screen versions with the additional new footage and updated interviews.  Now it would seem that Paramount has decided to revisit this marketing scheme with the Original Star Trek series, as well as the movies.  I'm beginning to wonder how many times I'll have to buy all these products before I give up.  Shame on me for being sucked in.
B00024BHTC|5.0|Once is clearly the most crucial release in the history of this finnish band, as they paid 200 000 uros from their own pockets to finance this album. I must say that it has really paid off since this is simply one of the finest albums ever by any Finnish band and the beast album I have heard in a while. Nuclear Blast staff must have difficulties keeping their pants clean as this has become the biggest success story in the history of the band, going number one in various European countries. <br />Once sees the band moving away from the double-bass-guitar-solo operatic power metal towards more symphonic and heavier sound. The London Symphony Orchestra and the choirs are well worth the cost as tracks like &quot;Ghost Love Score&quot; and &quot;Nemo&quot; can demonstrate. Naturally some of the older fans might be dissappointed by the change but nevertheless this is the album I feel songwriter Tuomas Holopainen has been dreaming of making, and as it is finally here, I can say that the man is a true artist. Some fans have also been critisized about Tarja's vocals as she uses a lot less opera vocals as in the early albums. But in my opinion, she is singing better than ever, as her vocals really support the melodies while with the earlier material it wass sometimes in contrast to the music. Her range seems much wider. My God, she is eveng doing oriental vocals there! This is just another example that Nightwish has found their true musical identity as Tarja's vocals now completely serve the music  instead of being a curiosity it seemed to be.<br />Of course, this is not a perfect album and some moments even seem to include a bit of unpurpous hilarity (like the beginning of &quot;Wish I Had An Angel&quot;), but there are no really weak tracks and there are plenty of moments and songs that are simply the most stunning music made in a while - by anyone. Only the chorus of &quot;Ghost Love Score&quot; is worth the effort. &quot;Nemo&quot; on the other hand is a perfect single,catchy, breathtakingly beautiful and majestetic. No wonder it's a hit. A true musical journey, not just for fans of metal. Highly recommended.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Well people this is great music. If you have blacks such as myself tuning into your material (listening to your sh*t) theres nothing else you need to do. Also my IQ is 143. What im trying to say is people who listen to this aren't stupid, so everyone who thinks we are have nothing to say. By the way if anyone thinks im fake and listen to this because it has rap in it you should know I also listen to Slipknot
0446608955|5.0|This book is so wonderful, not only does it tell a tragic love story, it shows how we can all be kind and loving.
B00006JJ1O|4.0|I got this CD because I liked &quot;All the Things She Said&quot; and it was only 7 dollars. It turned out to be pretty good. The girls may or may not be a novelty act, but if it is all just an act, it's one that works so well. Their voices sound really good together, and most of the songs are pretty good. &quot;All the Things She Said&quot; is good, but I also love &quot;Not Gonna Get Us&quot;, &quot;Show Me Love&quot;, and &quot;How Soon Is Now&quot;. The other songs are good, but those songs really stand out to me.
B0001MDP3G|2.0|Perhaps some of your reviewers are not familiar with Homer's Odyssey, on which this movie is based.  Cold Mountain tells us little about the Civil War, just as the Odyssey tells us little about the Trojan War (that was in the Iliad, the basis of another recent movie).  The parallelism between CM and the Odyssey is lame and stilted, even down to some tacky Sirens! Odysseus finally arrives home to confront his wife's suitors, just as Inman does.  The Odyssey tells us little about Odysseus' relation to his wife, so it is hardly surprising that the relationship between Inman and Ada in CM is a blank.  It may have seemed a good idea to turn the Odyssey into CM; but the result is disappointing.

B00000AFGM|5.0|I was only 11 when this album first came out, and I hated Marilyn Manson. I thought he was really scary. Well, I'm older and (hopefully)smarter than I was back then, so I decided to give this CD a chance after hearing &quot;The Dope Show&quot; and loving it. Turns out it is an excellent album. What struck me the most was the level of emotion displayed throughout the CD. Very few times have I ever heard someone exorcise their personal demons so compellingly. The songs here are just so good. It's too bad the album didn't sell as well as it should have. When music sounds this good, everyone should be required to listen to it. <br />I can't really say I have a favorite song since all of them are so good. If I have to pick one, I would say &quot;Coma White&quot; because it is just a great song and I love the meaning behind it. I also love &quot;Disassociative&quot; and &quot;The Last Day on Earth&quot;, but this is truly one of those albums you can listen to all the way through without skipping over any songs.<br />I highly recommend this album. Not only will you wind up listening to it over and over, but you will get a newfound respect for Manson if you weren't a fan of his already.
B0001AP12G|5.0|When I first heard that Kanye West was gonna release an album, I was not very sure what to think but when I bought it, and listened to it, I knew that it was a winner. I advise everyone to listen to it since it is one of the best debut albums that I'vee ever heard.
078322608X|5.0|Inspired by the 1962 French short LA JET&Eacute;E--an unusual film from director Chris Marker that relays its narrative via a collage of still images--the sci-fi flick 12 MONKEYS tells the story of a tough convict (Bruce Willis) from circa 2040 C.E. who &quot;volunteers&quot; to travel backwards in time to the 1990s on a mission to locate the source of a viral pandemic that will wipe out more than 90% of the Earth's population before the year 2000.  This opus from auteur Terry Gilliam is more earnest and convincing than many of his previous efforts, and it is arguably his best film to date.  The convoluted plot does require viewers to be attentive and exercise the gray matter, but the audience is rewarded for the effort with a fascinating and satisfying cinematic experience.<br />The acting in 12 MONKEYS is top-notch, especially the work of the three principals.  As the time-traveling antihero, Bruce Willis delivers one of his greatest performances and is touchingly emotive as his character tries to accomplish his task while also retaining his health and sanity.  Playing a psychiatrist who eventually becomes Willis' love interest, the pretty Madeleine Stowe is convincingly as strong and intense or as vulnerable as the role demands.  And in his hilarious portrayal of a demented anarchist who also happens to be the son of a famous virologist, Brad Pitt fervently chews the scenery and nearly upstages his more experienced costars.<br />Willis' struggle with the psychological aporia and culture shock of traveling backwards in time while he also pieces together a complicated but vital puzzle makes for a literate yet gripping science-fiction thriller that keeps viewers guessing right up to the final scene.  Yes, the plot is complicated and labyrinthine, but it all ultimately comes together in an intense and scintillating epiphany.  Ardent sci-fi fans will especially enjoy the final payoff, but even filmgoers not normally into the genre will find 12 MONKEYS to be an enjoyable flick.<br />The standard DVD from Universal offers a nearly pristine digital transfer of the film in anamorphic widescreen at the original aspect ratio of 1.85:1.  Also included are cool bonus goodies like a feature commentary with director Gilliam and producer Chuck Roven, a featurette made during the film's production, the original theatrical trailer, and more.  Universal also offers 12 MONKEYS on a special DVD that offers DTS Dolby sound, but apparently the better sound comes at the cost of bonus features.<br />In short, 12 MONKEYS is a must-have for sci-fi fans, but all lovers of great cinema should be pleased to have this film in their DVD collections.ck.<br />The standard DVD from Universal offers a nearly pristine digital transfer of the film in anamorphic widescreen at the original aspect ratio of 1.85:1.

B00000IOSU|5.0|Sarah McLachlan never ceases to amaze me. She is amazingly consistent and is a one-of-a-kind artist. I wasn't sure if her live album would be as good as her studio albums, but not only does it succeed, it is better than her studio work. There is nothing like hearing thousands of people being silent at a concert because they are so touched and moved by the music. Sarah sings with such force and clarity. She has never sounded better. <br />This album does overlook much of her older material (Touch, all but one song off of Solace), but her choice of songs to include on this CD is excellent. All of the songs are outstanding, and are further proof Sarah is an incomparable singer-songwriter.<br />I give this album my highest recommendation. Each time I listen to it (which happens to be a lot), I find something new to love about it.
B0002I831S|5.0|i love star trek although i wasnt around when tos was originaly aired. it is my third fav. =star trek series. i did start to buy them on dvd got to around volume 20 and havent baught a volume beyond that. well now sense the dvd sets are comming out as seasons which i think i wrote a letter to paramount on putting the volumes in 5 volume sets this is a lot better cant wait til i get this set
B000002BVN|4.0|&quot;Blood On The Dance Floor&quot; is an example of how an artist can look at his/her original work, say &quot;What was that?!&quot;, and rework the music to the point where it is much more enjoyable and meaningful.  Michael Jackson helps us forget his angry, paranoid behavior on HIStory on this 13-track piece. The album's main message is: JUST DANCE.  One can stop worrying about the meaning of Michael's HIStory songs and simply enjoy the remixes.<br />In addition to the remixes, MJ added 5 new songs, recorded in studios all over the world on the HIStory 1996 Tour.  In my opinion, these songs could have definitely replaced some of the failures on HIStory.  They are well written, both lyrically and musically. The title track is a dance standard, and carries an updated &quot;Billie Jean&quot; type of plot. &quot;Morphine&quot;, though perhaps a bit strange, is easy to follow and enjoy (Oh God, he's got his Demerol!). &quot;Superfly Sister&quot; might remind some of &quot;In The Closet&quot;, with its provocative message and ever-infectious drum loop. &quot;Ghosts&quot; and &quot;Is It Scary&quot; kind of fall hand-in-hand. The mood is the same, and at one point, even the lyrics are the same.<br />As far as the remixes go, most of them improve on the original songs, with the exception of &quot;Earth Song&quot; and &quot;2 Bad&quot;.  My main distaste in the &quot;Earth Song&quot; remix is that the original is so wonderful.  It shouldn't have been tampered with. &quot;2 Bad&quot; should just be thrown out the window. Sorry, but the remix is horrible. It sounds like it was thrown together on a computer program. They should have put a &quot;Smile&quot; remix instead.<br />Overall though, this album outshines HIStory, and is definitely worth the purchase.
B00005JMCN|4.0|This film has many of the qualities of an epic: exceptional production values &amp; cast that place it in the same class as &quot;Braveheart&quot; or &quot;Gangs Of New York&quot;.  I see no reason why it would not be appropriate for kids, either.  Like &quot;Cold Mountain&quot;, another epic, I feel this movie is meant to be enjoyed without too much analysis.  I particularly enjoyed Jeff Bridges' performance, having just watched him in a very different role in &quot;Masked and Anonymous&quot; in which he plays a Woodstock-era reporter. His promotional tours on behalf of a Sea Biscuit-War Admiral matchup are effective.  Toby McGuire is also quite good as the troubled,hard-luck jockey, blind in one eye, who spends his off hours spinning foreign tall tales with his jockey friends; so is  the humorous radio reporter and also real-life jockey Gary Stevens. The movie's first hour is filled with quite a bit of Depression-era history which adds to the bravura of the film, as do the later Mexican segments.  It is perhaps historically inaccurate to portray Seabiscuit as an underdog, however, he was equal in size, I have read somewhere, to War Admiral. The movie, however, emphasizes that the trainer takes hard luck cases like Seabiscuit, who was lazy, and turns them into winners. Imdb.com has pointed out the numerous anachronisms in the film; they claim,for example, that a statue of Seabiscuit is clearly visible in the Santa Anita Raceway segments, and that the starting gates used in most of the races are historically inaccurate ; I doubt this would be much concern to the average viewer. One possible trouble with these Hollywood epics this and the others mentioned above is that they are pure escapism, that in all likelihood the eras portrayed in these movies were not so glamorous as they are portrayed, except perhaps for a select few. You can perhaps excuse Nicole Kidman's glamourous portrayal in &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; because her character  was from a big city--Charleston.No matter how you cut it, despite humble beginnings and even despite the tragic loss of a son, a successful racehorse owner's life is a privileged one.
8799701650|5.0|The book 'Lingua Latina: Familia Romana' is the first of a series of texts by the Natural Method Language Institutes designed to introduce the reader to Latin in a natural progression - there are few charts and boxes in this book, as it is not the typical Latin grammar.  From the very start, this book is a reader, in many ways similar to the early childhood readers with which young readers gain an understanding of language.  Page one does not start with a description of nouns, verbs, or other parts of speech; but rather with simple sentences - 'Roma in Italia est.  Italia in Europa est.'  And it proceeds from there.<br />Readers learn Latin in a progression, as the readings get more complex very slowly, introducing new vocabulary, verb tenses, declensions, word order, etc. along the way.  In addition to the introduction to the language, the reader gets an introduction to the Roman culture and history - this first volume looks at family matters and basic household items and ideas, in addition to very general facts about Rome, such as the fact that it is in Italy, which is in turn in Europe.<br />There is a sidebar along each page that helps to expand the pieces of language - however, this is all done in Latin.  There are no English (or German, or any other language) explanations - all is done in Latin, just as in early childhood readers for children, all of the other notations are likewise in the same language as the primary text.<br />There are twenty sections (XX), in addition to a vocabulary list at the back of the book.  There are line-art drawings and maps throughout that help to explain the vocabulary and action (as there are no English definitions, the pictures become crucial in many instances toward understanding the text - again, much in the way children's books use pictures to explain the new words introduced).<br />This is a book that children could use to learn Latin; however, it is also a great way for adults to learn - it is fun, and it seems remarkably easy (rather than the chore of lists of declensions, conjugations and vocabulary words that can often seem lifeless in their required memorisation).  You'll be amazed at how quickly and easily the rudiments of Latin can be grasped.  While this process can only go so far into the language, it is a great introduction; this text and the subsequent volumes by Hans H. Oerberg are a fascinating and accessible way to gain a useful working knowledge of Latin.ably easy (rather than the chore of lists of declensions, conjugations and vocabulary words that can often seem lifeless in their required memorisation).

B000002JSJ|3.0|This is the second worst of Zeppelin's CD's (Only Coda was worse). &quot;Only Achillies Stand&quot; and &quot;Nobody's Fault But Mine&quot; are very good, the rest is filler (Candy Store Rock might be the WORST Zeppelin song EVER (That or &quot;Hats Off To Roy Harper&quot; it is close)). This CD is for completests only (And I guarantee you, it will not be played that often even by them (I know, I have everything except &quot;Coda&quot;, and I avoid &quot;Presence&quot; like the plague). You can get &quot;Achillies Last Stand&quot; amd &quot;Nobodys Fault But Mine&quot; in disk 2 of &quot;Early Days &amp; Latter Days&quot; (An excellent greatest hits package), so you do not even need to spend the money on &quot;Presence&quot; to get them. Simply put, this is a bad Zeppelin CD.
B000002J09|5.0|This CD not only sold more albums then most new bands (and believe me, most new bands such as a band I hate called Limp Bizkit), but they created some of the most popular songs of our time.  Now, Im only 14 and I'm obsessed with Zeppelin.  I think that Jimmy Page was way ahead of his time when he played the guitar.  He had soooooo many creative ideas, not only for electric, but for the acoustic too!  The CD begins with Black Dog, a fast paced song with awesome lyrics and amazing guitar.  The solo at the end is awesome.  This song is probably one of the better Zeppelin songs that were released.  Next up is Rock and Roll, a really cool song that plays on commercials an awful lot (look for those Cadallacs!!!).  This song starts off like a blues type song and erupts into a song based on rock and roll.  Really good singing on Robert Plant's part and another great song by Zep.  Next is Battle Of Evermore, a really neat song that sounds as if it came straight from the LOTR series.  Now, I don't even need to explain why the 4th song on the album is famous... but Im still going to anyway.  Stairway to Heaven is the perfect song.  Perfect lyrics by Plant, superb job on the guitar (acoustic AND electric) by Page.  Not only did him and Plant create one of the most famous songs ever, but Page created the most famous guitar solo ever!!  Running at 8 minutes, this song never got tired on the radio.  To this day, it is the most played song on the radio.  The rest of the CD is amazing, including Going To California, a really cool acoustic song.  Don't listen to all the one star reviewers.  They don't know how to tell good guitarists from another.  It takes skill to create solos for every single songs.  It takes even more skill to make these solos some of the #1 ones in the world.  However, it doesn't take any skill what so ever to pick up a guitar, play four or five bar chords over and over while adding effects and screaming while swearing.  That's not skill.  Zepp is skill.
B000002JSP|5.0|I really like this CD a lot, I cannot believe ANY Zeppelin fan giving it less than 5 stars: &quot;In The Evening&quot; is one of the top 5 Zeppelin songs ever, &quot;Fool In The Rain&quot; is not far behind, and &quot;Hot Dog&quot; is a real fun song as well. As far as a Zeppelin CDs are concerned here they are: 1: Zeppelin 2. 2: Physical Grafitti. 3: Zofo. 4: Houses Of The Holy. 5: Zeppelin 1. 6: IN THROUGH THE OUT DOOR. 7: The Song Remains The Same. 8: BBC Sessions. 9: Zeppelin 3. 10: How The West Was Won. 11: Presence. 12: Coda. So this is really is a great final CD for the band.
B000002J03|5.0|Led Zeppelin rocked the world with tunes such as The Immigrant Song, Black Dog, Rock and Roll, and of course, the ever popular Stairway to Heaven.  But, there are not too many people that I know  who appriciate the power of the older Led Zeppelin.  Some of Zepp's very best stuff was on this album, including one of their heavier songs, Whole Lotta Love.  This song hooked me from the moment the riffs started up.  Wonderful song.... Heartbraker was also a very good song.  I think I may of liked the How The West Was Won version a bit better because I'm a sucker for good guitar solos, and LONG ones, at that.  The How The West Was Won Version is extended substantially.  But, that doesn't mean that the Led Zep 2 version isn't good.<BR>    However, my very favorites off this album are Moby Dick and Ramble On.  Moby Dick, I first heard on How The West Was Won.  It was a 19 minute long song, and John Bonham played his very best drums in that song.  I bought LedZep2 and was still impressed.  Bonham's drumming skills are much better then I actually thought.  And Ramble On.... O, that song caught me the moment it started.  I love acoustic songs by bands, especially Led Zep, cause they always find a way to make the slowest of acoustic songs interesting.<BR>    As I said in the title, this isn't their best CD, but has some of their very best songs on it and is worthy of recognition.  Definatly buy this album if you are into LEd Zeppelin
B000001F62|3.0|The Moody Blues have always intrigued me, but never hooked me.  Since I'm not musically trained I'm really in no position to critique the musical attributes of their compositions, but I will say that the band can often sound much more compelling than what they are saying in their lyrics.  Even the title and cover art, which give allusions to the mysteries of childhood, create more wonderment than tangible meaning, and you wander off wondering if THAT'S what the meaning of the album is.  Certainly the Moody's are the Kings of the Concept Album.  Perhaps if they had received less acclaim for 'Days of Future Passed' they could have broken out of that self-imposed box prior to 'Seventh Sojourn'.<br />'Every Good Boy Deserves Favor' starts out wonderfully, if you overlook 'Procession' as an actual song, and regard it as an experimental, Beatlesque mix of random sounds.  The acual music breaks open with the classic 'The Story In Your Eyes', such an engaging, well-structured, empowered song that it simply does not give the rest of the album a chance.  While there are other worthy songs on the disc, there is no question that it is 'downhill from here'.  The next three songs are strong, with 'Guessing Game' offering a graceful melody and thoughtful lyrics, 'Emily's Song', which was released as a single in the United Kingdom could be mistaken for Simon and Garfunkle fare (that's a compliment), and 'After You Came', being the only legitimate rock song on the album save 'The Story...', features interesting lyrics and simply rocks real nice.<br />The remainder of the album may remind you of college basketball before the shot clock showed the grave to the slow-down game.  'One More Time To Live' starts out promising, but segues from relaxing images of an English garden, &quot;look out in the hedgerow...&quot;, to a chorus of cacophonic pronouncements such as &quot;desolation&quot;, &quot;pollution&quot;, &quot;revolution&quot; and &quot;starvation&quot;.  I suppose there is a point in it, but it's not aurally appealing, and perhaps it wasn't meant to be.<br />Sometimes the faux depth of meaning is more deliberate and playful, as in the cheerful, even psychedelic imagery offered in 'Nice To Be Here', which plays on life scenes reminiscent of The Beatles 'Being For the Benefit Of Mr. Kite', such as &quot;Jack Rabbit loudly drumming&quot;, &quot;a mouse played a daffodil&quot;, and &quot;the frog's guitar solo&quot;.  It is playfully entertaining, and the music is a fit complement to the message.  <br />'You Can Never Go Home' and 'My Song' drearily close out the album, with the former offering abstract lyrics such as &quot;High above the forest lie the pastures of the Sun, where the two that learned the secret now are one&quot;.  The latter, as with several other songs on 'EGBDF', is mired in hippie-think messages such as &quot;love can change the world, love can change your life&quot;, and even reaches so far as &quot;There's life in other worlds, maybe they'll come to Earth, helping man to find a way&quot;.  Beam us up, Scotty.<br />It's a shame to have to tolerate the 'down-side' to 'EGBDF' in order to own 'The Story In Your Eyes', 'Emily's Song', and 'After You Came'.  Perhaps a compilation CD or a good live disc of the band is the wiser choice...  The liner notes are sparse and no lyrics are included, though they are available on-line and can help to make the listening experience more coherant.
B000002H33|5.0|I have all of the Metallica CDs but Kill Em' All and St. Anger.  But, I think even if I got them, they wouldn't be able to live up to the powerful Master of Puppets.  Master of Puppets is my favorite Metallica album (with Load and Ride the Lightning as a close second).  Every song on this album is perfect.  Starting off with Battery, its slow, acoustic beginning, slowly getting faster and louder until Kirk is strumming out the riffs and James is yelling his angry lyrics.  Next is my favorite song, Master of Puppets.  Now, it's not my favorite Metallica song (One and Fade to Black are), but it is definatly one of my favorites.  The riffs and the guitar solo in it are amazing.  Sanitarium is also another one of my favorites.  The song is a slow and sad, yet simply amazing  ballad that builds up its energy during the chorus and the solos.  The rest of the songs on this album are great too, including the instrumental, Orion (I personally think that The Call of Ktula is better).  If you are a metal fan or a Metallica fan, make this one you must have's (that is, unless you haven't already gotten it!!!)
B00028HBKM|5.0|\\"Rather, The Passion is a cinematic experience that serves an almost singular purpose: to show the scourging and death of Jesus Christ in such horrifically graphic detail (with Gibson's own hand pounding the nails in the cross) that even non-believers may feel a twinge of sorrow and culpability in witnessing the final moments of the Son of God, played by Jim Caviezel in a performance that's not so much acting as a willful act of submission, so intense that some will weep not only for Christ, but for Caviezel's unparalleled test of endurance.\\"<BR>This is quite possibly the dumbest thing I have read on amazon.com thus far. I totally disagree with the whole thing.
B0000TLA9G|5.0|This CD is most definatly a must have for the Guns and Roses fan.  It has many of their greatest hits, such as the infamous Sweet Child O' Mine, Paradise City and Welcome To The Jungle.  <BR>    There are many hits that could of been on this album that weren't put on, such as Estranged and I Used To Love Her (which is one of my personal favorites.)<BR>    However, I don't agree with everyone that gave this album 2 stars.  For one, there are MANY other good songs on this CD that make up for the ones not on it, like Civil War, You Could Be Mine, Knockin' On Heaven's Door and Don't Cry.  <BR>    There are a lot of cover songs on this CD... maybe a little too much.  I do think they should of had more regular songs that GNR made themselves.<BR>    Never the less, this doesn't mean that the CD is not good.  I would definatly recommend this CD to GNR fans.
B00000J7RZ|5.0|Jennifer lopez is definitely a super star. She is beautiful, sexy and she has talent. When i heard IF YOU HAD MY LOVE i said that i have to buy \\"On the 6\\". And i bought it. It is a great album with a lot of good songs. My favourite song is \\"Waiting for tonight\\" and \\"no me ames\\". The first one i love it because every time i listen it i dance. The second one because i love that tone and it is a good slow song. Other masterpiece of that album is \\"Lets get loud\\", \\"If you had my love\\", \\"Feelin'so good\\", \\"Baila\\", \\"Talk about us\\", \\"Promise me you'll try\\", \\"Should've never\\", \\"Una moche mas\\" etc. In the beginning i put 4 stars on that album but after i remember the very good pictures and artwork of that album. also inlay you will find the lyrics. Jennifer lopez is the best. (...)
0446530891|2.0|While I generally enjoy David Baldacci's books, this one was somewhat of a disappointment. It was a relatively entertaining read, but not much else. I thought the characters were a little too typecast and cliched. For example Michelle Maxwell was the perfect ex-jock golden girl. She was practically flawless. <br />Also, the plot ran at an okay pace, but it was nothing to alert the media about. Split Second is all about how a political assassination that happened more than a decade ago links to the kidnapping of John Bruno, a candidate for the presidency of the United States. Bruno is kidnapped as a result of Secret Service Agent Maxwell's error in judgment, and thus she sets out to exonerate herself by linking up with ex-Agent Sean King-- the man who took the heat for the first assassination. The rest of the book is basically all about how the two form a partnership and go about trying to nab the bad guys and clear their name.<br />Its a decent plot, but the characters don't do the plot justice. And there are parts of the story where I felt the evidence was rather weak. At certain junctures it even seemed as though Baldacci had run out of options and was just winging it.<br />So read it if you've got nothing better to do. But if you want a good Baldacci nail-biter, pick up Saving Faith instead.

B00005JMJ4|1.0|I am a huge fan of Bill Murray and this was by far the worst movie that I have ever seen.  After all the awards that this movie won I thought it would be worth watching.  I could not have been more wrong.  I actually watched the whole movie but that was only because I thought that at any time the movie would start to make sense - it does not happen!  Do not waste your money like I did.  If you really want to see this movie, I suggest renting it.  I just wish I could take mine back to the store for a full refund!
B00018D44U|3.0|Only the Beatles could have followed &quot;Come away with Me&quot; with an equally successful and pleasing sophmore album.  But this one has pleasing moments and shouldn't be ignored.  Just don't expect perfection twice in a row.  Lower your expectations; think of her as another pop singer and you'll find the album quite pleasing.  Hopefully now that she has her sophmore jitters out of her systems, her next album will be truer to her and more like &quot;Come away with me&quot; free and full of unexpected twists and turns.  Not so much pressure to be commercial.
B00009W0U4|1.0|What a thrash of a movie! Can't see what's the rave all about.<BR>Tries to disguise a poor movie by doing silly things like running it in back to front (it starts with the end of the movie and work itself to the start). In between, one gets tortured by foul language aplenty and worse still a cameraman who seems to have been told by the director to point his camera to anywhere other than where he's supposed to. As a result, certain part of the movie was simply a pain and agony to watch with picture of darkened ceiling, flashing lights and nothing more than that.<BR>Then, there's that attempt at plot. What a pathetic attempt at that. If you manage to figure out the back-to-front sequencing, then it's about a young (good-looking one) lady attending a party and deciding to leave early. On the way home, she got raped (and I believe many thought this is ground-breaking since it takes up a few minutes of groaning and further foul language). Boyfriend left party and found her raped, got raging mad running around looking for the culprit, thought he found the guy in a gay club (here's where you gotta tolerate the camera work mentioned above), got into a fight and his mate with him killed the one he was fighting with. Police arrives, take them away. END OF SHOW!!! Now how's that for plot!<BR>Almost had to shut it off after the first 15 minutes but thought why not tolerate it to see how bad it can be. And believe me, it can be and indeed is VERY bad!<BR>So here it is. A very badly made movie trying to disguise itself as something more than that by violence, nudity and sex. Do you need it?<BR>Oh yes, it's in French so be ready to get through the movie reading subtitles if the above doesn't alert you to what's in store.
B000094DUP|5.0|To even call this a pop album is something of a stretch, because what Delta Goodrem has done with \\"Inocent Eyes\\", is deliver an album that can appeal equally to 8 year old girls as to my 45 year old Bob Dylan loving mother. Dido may have hit the jackpot with melancholy, bitter-sweet and somewhat depressing songs, but Delta has hit the nail on the head in every conceivable way from great songwriting, use of instruments, powerful vocals and fantastic variety.<br />Yes, piano driven ballads feature prominently on this CD as that is Delta's style, but really, what's amazing about Delta is that she hasn't just stuck with what she knows best, she's taken risks and they've paid off. My two favourite songs on the album are the ever-popular classic rock tune \\"Predictable\\", a clear winner among fans, and \\"Throw It Away\\", a highly underrated up-tempo guitar tune that was scheduled as Delta's fifth single in the UK but was later cancelled.<br />Then we have the ballads, with \\"Not Me, Not I\\" taking the cake for finest and and most moving ballad in recent history. \\"A Year Ago Today\\" is similarly moving though perhaps less catchy and the lyrics will bring tears to your eyes. \\"Will You Fall For Me\\" is another HUGE favourite among fans as it's just her and the piano, and really shows off her amazing musical talent. \\"In My Own Time\\" is perhaps my least favourite song on the Album, but even so, it's a wonderfully soft and beautiful composition. \\"Butterfly\\" is perhaps the most uplifting song I have yet heard, and when she raises her voice an octave towards the end, it sends shivers down my back. And of course there's \\"Born To Try\\", her signature tune with a chorus to die for.<br />There are the more upbeat songs like \\"Longer\\", which I love because the lytics tell a great story of unrequited love. \\"My Big Mistake\\" has an appropriate title as it is my other least favourite song on the CD, the verses and bridge are fantastic, but the chorus is the only time on the CD that Delta really strays into bubblegum pop territory. \\"Lost Without You\\", is one of the darkest and catchiest pop tunes of the past few years, you can really feel the yearning in her voice as she sings the chorus. While \\"Running Away\\" extends the album's variety again as Delta pulls off a true \\"Corrs\\"-style song with easily the catchiest tune on the CD.<br />And then there are those songs which are almost impossible to categorize. \\"Innocent Eyes\\" is one. Often considered her best song both lyrically and vocally, this one has a great auto-biographical story to tell and has hints of pop, rock, country and even classical. Finally, \\"This Is Not Me\\" is one that will grow on you. It constitutes some fantastic electric guitar chords and has some nice lyrics, even if Delta's voice is drowned out at times. It's hard to categorize this one aswell, but whenever I hear it I always think of it as a folk tune.<br />In all. I have listened to modern pop artists from Mariah Carey to Celine Dion. Britney Spears to Dido. Shania Twain to Anastacia. Shakira to Christina Aguelira. And all come off as contrived crap compared to \\"Innocent Eyes\\". The Album has gone 15 x Platinum in Oz, has produced 5 multipule platinum number 1 singles, has won 7 ARIAs (Australian version of the Grammys) and has even been awarded songwriting awards proving this is a pop album that is unlikely to be beaten in the near future. America better watch out, this young lady is preparing to take the States by storm, and all without having to bare her breast or fit into a skimpy top in a raunchy music video.<br />The following is a quick run-down of the album's songs and what I rate them.<br />1)Born To Try : 9/10 - powerful and memorable<BR>2)Innocent Eyes : 8.5/10 - original, but her voice reaches a yell towards the end<BR>3)Not Me, Not I : 10/10 - one of the best love ballads of the pop era<BR>4)Throw It Away : 11/10 - Excellent change-up to the many singles on the first half of the album.

Minnie left us too soon...Syreeta left us without getting her props while she was here - here is my tribute (Both Minnie and Syreeta were a part of the original WonderLove, Stevie's background singers).  People know so little about her and there is so mucn to tell.  When Stevie was on Oprah recently, he gave an I LOVE YOU SYREETA shout out to her mid-song...she wrote and co-wrote some of stevie's greatest hits....i love just about anything stevie has ever touched, this includes syreeta, his first wife:-)The love and respect between those two continued even after the divorce and the relationship was admirable.  A GREAT WRITER WITH THE VOICE OF AN ANGEL - GONE BUT NOT FORGOTTEN....RIP SYREETA
B0000025ZF|5.0|With the Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking, Roger Waters took some of the musical ideas that he has been using since Dark Side (connecting songs together in beautiful ways), but somehow, this album was done differently. The entire album sounds like it is one song tied together with the voices of actors (other than in the middle when you would turn the record over). Using his brilliant sound effects to tell a story of a strange nightmare and the brilliant guitar of Eric Clapton. Although nothing that Roger Waters has done as a solo artist has become to come close to what he accomplished with the Floyd, this album is well worth the buy. It is beautiful, melodic and sometimes a little odd with bits of guitar solos that are amazing. <br />The only criticism on the album is that this album is a little too much like the other things he has done with his career. Using the same blueprint: good songs, sound effects and it needs to tell a story.<br />In conclusion, this album is as good as Roger Waters gets. So pick it up, it would be better if you were to pick it up on vinyl though, brings out the character the album already has
1573300403|5.0|This package was released sometime after the 1997 release of Michael Jackson's BLOOD ON THE DANCE FLOOR album. There is a video for BOTDF in this package. I just love SCREAM. That video features MJ's sister Janet,who's freaky like her brother. Take note of two censorships when the video is seen on MTV or VH1. The second word of the quoted line in SCREAM that goes &quot;stop f---ing with me&quot; is muted and also during that,Janet &quot;flips the digit&quot; which is blurred. Sorry,they're just following FCC regulations. No MJ fan should be without this package unless he/she chooses not to.
B00005JMJG|5.0|I honestly don't know where to begin when describing this movie.  Is it a comedy? Is it a drama? A love story? A strange trip?  Quite simply yes it is. And at the same time it's one of the most original movies of the past five years that aren't obscure fare that 10 people see and declare it life changing.<br />The story is an everyman/everywoman story of love, loss, redemption, and memory.  We've all had relationships we say we want to forget forever when they're finished,  forget all the bad times that led to the loss of the relationship.  This movie perfectly captures that you may want to forget all the bad things but then you'd lose everything else you found along the way.<br />Usually when I see a movie, even a good one, I walk out of the theatre and within half an hour I remember the basics of it, the funny lines,  the epic battle scenes.  But when I walked away from this movie it stayed with me for days.  I would hear a song and equate it to the movie (btw \\"I Am Trying To Break Your Heart\\" by Wilco is dead on to the movie),  watch something on television and find something from the movie. The last line of the memory erase gave me chills.  I've rambled enough. If you like great movies buy this the day it comes out,  I know I will, it comes out the day before my birthday so a birthday present for me.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|Excellent.  A great theatrical update for 2004 of the underlying premise of &quot;It's a Wonderful Life&quot;; the unknown purpose of a life or at least the effects of an individual's actions.  I highly recommend this DVD. The documentaries on the chaos theory and time travel (especially the references to other movies in that genre) are splendid.  The acting is truly amazing and one can believe each character with different personalities in each alternate reality.  Read a few of the other reviews for some great plot summaries.  Wish there was release with none of the nudity, maybe without the Goth roommate altogether.  Would be a great movie to show or recommend to high-schoolers for class discussions on chaos theory and life choices.
0440224764|2.0|I picked this book of the top of a stack that my friend was planning on giving to the library.  It is the hardback version, and I simply have a weakness for free hardbacks.  Yes, I know I'm a freak....<br />Most of my exposure to Grisham has been through the movies that were made from his books, so I'm not too familiar with his actual writing.  The Partner is a very quick read, coming in around 350 pages in hardback, this is a fairly straight forward story.<br />Patrick Lanigan has faked his death and stolen $90 million of his former firms ill gotten gains.  The story really starts at his capture in Brazil and lays out the &quot;how he done it&quot; over the course of the book. The problem for me was that the book devolved into characatures instead of buidling interesting people to follow. It just seemed too formulaic at times and way too many things just fell into place to be believable. In hollywood when an proven actor/actress stars in a bomb and doesn't appear to try it is generally said the actor &quot;dialed it in&quot;.  I think Grisham did the same here.<br />Frankly, a lot of reviews here didn't like the ending, but that was really my favorite part.  Wasn't too much of a surprise, but boy did it give me some satisfaction.  All in all, there are other things you can be reading for pure entertainment, but this book wasn't totally lacking some redeeming qualities.
B000099T2L|5.0|Undeniably talented in the areas of songwriting, production, and singing, Beyonce is just a talent that makes the word talent stand so true.<br />Dangerously in Love thus far as sold over 8,000,000+.  That's a statistic that shows that she is appreciated and the quality of the album is unbreakable. <br />How can you deny this album as a great R&amp;B album? Everything from &quot;Crazy in Love&quot; to &quot;Daddy&quot; is just treasurable.  And songs like &quot;Yes&quot;, &quot;The Closer I Get To You&quot;, and &quot;Gift From Virgo&quot; are just stand outs.<br />This album stands proof of Beyonce w/o DC in reference to her individuality and spark to music.  With the group or without the group, she is her own star that shines bright.
B00003CX9E|4.0|The best review of Citizen Kane - perhaps of any film - I've ever read is the one titled &quot;Narrative and Eye Disconnect&quot;  posted by &quot;A viewer from Richmond, VA USA&quot; on March 21, 2004.  I recommend searching through Amazon's reviews to find it, then watching Citizen Kane and re-reading that review.  Even though the reviewer gives Kane just one star, s/he writes with great insight into the movie and cinema in general, and has enhanced my appreciation of Citizen Kane exponentially.  Thank you, &quot;Viewer from Richmond,&quot; whoever you are!
B000089RVX|2.0|Evanesence's debut album, &quot;Fallen,&quot; has quickly rose to being one of the biggest rock albums of both this year and last. The interesting part of the story is that Evanescence is essentially Ben Moody and Amy Lee. The album that you hear is simply Lee on vocals, Moody on guitars and piano, and a handful of studio musicians filling in the rest of the parts, including Josh Freese (A Perfect Circle, The Vandals) on drums. From a production standpoint, you can already see where this album is going. &quot;Fallen&quot; is simply slick, corporate rock masked to teenagers in the form of a pseudo-goth front-woman. Don't believe me? Compare the production style on &quot;Fallen&quot; to Linkin Park's &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; or &quot;Meteora.&quot; Either way, when it comes down to it, &quot;Fallen&quot; is simply a late-90's nu-metal offering contemporized in a &quot;Linkin-Park-ish&quot; manner to fit today's modern rock radio crowd. Drums have a ton of power and attack, guitars are mid-range cut percussive bangs, vocals are processed beyond belief and bass simply rumbles along the edge of the mix. Songwriting on the album is what gives this CD a review of two stars. While I disapprove of the mix, the songwriting is rather excellnt in a pop style. That's right, I said pop style. Face it, Evanescence isn't anything other that modern pop songs with a certain recording style and mix that turn it into rock. Justin Timberlake could sing the same songs over the same mix and the final outcome would be relativley equal. However, clearly Ben Moody knows what he's doing, and can write songs (he has since written for Avril Lavinge). Songs such as &quot;Going Under&quot; and &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; are excellently crafted with both music and lyrics. It is hard to deny the catchyness of most of the tunes on the album; hence its radio popularity. The main question now lies with Moody's departure. As the main songwriter of the band, how will Evanescence come up with a new album? Methinks their record label has a few songwriters and producers already in mind. &quot;Fallen&quot; isn't the epitomy of great rock music, but the songs are solid and catchy, with a Linkin Park feel, and thats all you can really expect.
B00006RINF|4.0|The Italian gothic metal band Lacuna Coil has not been particularly well-known in the United States since the release of their first album in 1998, but more and more people on this side of the Atlantic are getting the opportunity to listen to Cristina Scabbia's hauntingly beautiful vocals along with her co-vocalist, Andrea Ferro. Their most recent album, &quot;Comalies&quot;, which was released in 2002 and is their fourth album, contains 13 tracks.  All of the songs contain English lyrics, but the last track (the title track) contains some Italian lyrics.  Some people have compared Cristina Scabbia's voice with Amy Lee, who is the lead vocalist of the band Evanescence.  Both singers are very good, but Cristina Scabbia's voice is slightly deeper and more voluptuous than that of Amy Lee.  My ratings for each of the 13 tracks on &quot;Comalies&quot; are listed below.<br />1. &quot;Swamped&quot; (5 stars).  Soft start that suddenly breaks open with Cristina and Andrea's vocals very melodic guitar, bass and keyboards.  The choruses feature Cristina's vocals, but the verses feature Andrea's vocals with some background vocals by Christina.<BR>2. &quot;Heaven's A Lie&quot; (5 stars).  The beginning crescendos with guitar, bass, keyboards &amp; percussion before Christina begins her vocals.  She is joined in the choruses by Andrea.<BR>3. &quot;Daylight Dancer&quot; (4.5 stars).  Metallic notes slightly similar to a celesta begin this interesting song and continue throughout.<BR>4. &quot;Humane&quot; (4.5 stars). Electronic beginning with Christina's vocals begins this slower, very melodic song before being joined by percussion, guitar and bass.<BR>5. &quot;Self Deception&quot; (4 stars).  A harder song featuring Andrea's vocals, guitar, bass and percussion. Christina sings during the choruses.<BR>6. &quot;Aeon&quot; (4.5 stars).  A lengthy instrumental introduction starts this brief song (just under 2 minutes) before sounding briefly like a broken record to give way to a melodic ballad featuring Christina's voice.  It's essentially an introduction to the next track.<BR>7. &quot;Tight Rope&quot; (5 stars).  Strong guitar, bass and percussion are featured along with vocals by both Christina and Andrea using a good melodic chord progression.<BR>8. &quot;The Ghost Woman and the Hunter&quot; (4 stars).  A mixture of forward and reverse-sounding chords are played throughout this ballad that primarily features Christina's vocals.<BR>9. &quot;Unspoken&quot; (3.5 stars).  Probably the least interesting song on the album, &quot;Unspoken&quot; primarily features Christina's vocals occasionally interlaced with Andrea.<BR>10. &quot;Entwined&quot; (4 stars).  A good combination of vocals from Christina and Andrea in a slower ballad.<BR>11. &quot;The Prophet Said&quot; (4.5 stars).  A more intense song with lots of guitar, bass and percussion and featuring Andrea's vocals with Christina in the choruses.<BR>12. &quot;Angel's Punishment&quot; (4.5 stars).  An eclectic combination of spoken vocals by Christina and choruses that are a mixture of Andrea's screaming vocals and Christina's melodic vocals.<BR>13. &quot;Comalies&quot; (4.5 stars).  A strong final track to this ablum using a good mixture of keyboards, guitar, bass and percussion fused with Christina's melodic vocals.<br />Overall, I rate the album &quot;Comalies&quot; by Lacuna Coil with 4 out of 5 stars.  In addition to Cristina Scabbia and Andrea Ferro, the other band members include Cristiano Migliore (guitars), Marco Biazzi (guitars), Marco Coti Zelati (bass) and Cristiano Mozzati (drums).  Not everyone who listens to the album will like it, but if you enjoy melodic metal, then chances are that you will.

B000000W5P|5.0|This is probably their biggest selling album. 10 songs, a Temptations cover and 9 originals: 2 non-descript punk-based tunes, the disco-esque &quot;Miss You&quot;, classic rock standards &quot;Beast Of Burden&quot; and &quot;Shattered&quot;, the beautifully offensive country tune &quot;Far Away Eyes&quot;, Keith singing lead on the hard rocking &quot;Before They Make Me Run&quot;, and generally a sloppy feel as Ron Wood and Mick Jagger play more of the guitar than normal. Few if any studio musicians make an appearance. &quot;Some Girls&quot; is a sort of laid back tune, more offensive lyrics here, and basically you have the Stones being themselves, and that is one cool sound. When they follow a trend, they always do it well, whether it's psychedelia (&quot;2000 Light Years from Home&quot;) or grunge (&quot;Love is Strong&quot;), and that remains true on this one. Here they absorb Punk, Disco, and 70's Rock influences, and do them better than just about anyone. Irresistable.

0930289528|4.0|A vision of a totalitarian future of Britian cut off from contact with the rest of the world (which may no longer exist), this story is very indiciative of the time when Alan Moore started it, the early 1980s. It's a bleak view of the future from the British culture that gave us punk rock and Max Headroom. Compared to them, this is somewhat optimistic. However, it's also obvious that Moore didn't finish the story soon after he started it, instead returning to it years later (sometime during his work on DC's _The Watchmen_). There is a change in the outlook and a bit of a rushed feel towards the end.<br />There are two protagonists in this story: the vigilante, a terrorist who takes on the totalitarian government while dressed as Guy Fawkes, and the girl he saves from government thugs and then mentors. But Moore follows the lives of a number of characters, from party officials to cheap thugs, and views this world through their eyes. The characterizations of these people making their lives in an oppressive regime is realistic. The change of views is also a nice parallel to the story's all-seeing computer and camera system that the vigilante hacks into and slowly takes control of.<br />Moore doesn't make the vigilante, known as V, impossibly pure. In fact, V's manipulation of the somewhat innocent wife of a party official, Rose, is harsh. He justifies his cruel manipulations as necessary to create a natural outcome of anarchy. And he seems to  place art above people at times -- a truly complex character.<br />This is not Moore's most mature work, but there is an energy and imagination here that is excellent, and the pacing works well. Others' comparissons to Orwell's work and even _Lord of the Flies_ are well earned. Although I disagree with some of the politics Moore champions, I think the internal logic of the story is sound, as are most of the characters' motives and actions. Moore presents what kind of people really make up a despotic state.<br />The art is also not up to modern standards, instead confined to the format of the British magazine it was originally serialed in.  That's best viewed as an amusing artifact.<br />Without a doubt, this book shows its age -- as much as _1984_, _Animal Farm_, and other politically-oriented fables do. Times change, but futuristic stories are more about the times they're written in than the future. And this is a fable with a definite (political) moral -- despite the rest of the story's subtlety and shadings.
B00008J4P5|1.0|Does that mean we don't have to listen to the songs, but rather, just know that they are there? Or maybe we're supposed to just look at the cover, and the CD inside is just for keeping the paper from getting floppy. Would it be better art if the CD was completely blank, just the sound of an empty room? Cutting edge stuff, huh? High art. Maybe just a little too much art.<BR>&quot;Art&quot; is one of those words that can be applied to every and anything, and so it is. Lot's of crap is called art while reeking the stench of undeniable pretentiousness. On the other hand a lot of great &quot;art&quot; isn't called or marketed as art at all. It may fall into the category &quot;art&quot;, but it's a painting, or a statue, or a photograph, a design, a song.<BR>&quot;We are all artists and everything is art&quot; is a statement that cannot  be refuted, leaving the word &quot;art&quot; and much of it's misuse overly bloated and pathetically awkward.<BR>When you reiterate this &quot;art speak&quot; on behalf of the &quot;artist&quot; it does seem as if you have been duped by the art of the con.
B00006879E|5.0|I saw Maroon 5 live in August 2003.  I had barely heard &quot;Harder to Breathe&quot;, and I was only slightly excited that they were coming.  However, once they started playing, I was in love.  Not only is Adam Levine hot, but their songs really spoke to me.  They display so many emotions in their songs that they pull you in.  I was hooked even before &quot;This Love&quot; came out, as were all of my friends.  I enjoy every song--my favorite changes all the time.  &quot;This Love&quot; is the current ringer on my phone, and I listen to the CD every day. It's definitely worth the money, and I'm sure that everyone can find at least one song to identify with.  I also recommend seeing them live--I'm seeing them again in Nashville in August.  These guys will be around for a long time--they've already proven themselves as true originals.
0151006903|5.0|This book will make you lagh out loud about every 20 pages or so.  As noted by the previous reviewer the book shifts genres about 2/3 of the way through.  Its starts as historical fiction and then shifts into pure fantasy.  Also, an element of farce  permeates the book as Baudolino is a virtuoso of languages and a near genius, and just happens to be at the center of every major historical event of the period (not unlike Forest Gump). This makes for both a very interesting and hillarious read.    In the end the reader is left to ponder what may have happened and what Eco was up to.  If you pay attention early on and recall Baudolino's motivation for telling us his story you may find some resolution.  Eco once again provides a litany of medieval trivia and weaves it into his story almost effortlessly.  Once again Eco effortlessly underpins the entire story with fundamental questions about the nature of reality and what counts as knowledge.   This is truly a good and entertaining book

B000089RVX|5.0|Evanescence is the most promising group that has appeared in the rock musical scene after a long period of silence... <br /> The singer's voice is ethereal, haunting, loud and clear, spreading amazingly in full spectrum, strong and solid at low notes imperiously transcending to highs. <br /> The guitar themes are always present and worked in such an original way that they don't focus on simply escorting the singer but they introduce a new melody which runs in parallel with the singer's tune and does not wait to crescent only at the songs' bridges as Linkin Park or Lacuna Coil often do. The result is a vigorous mix of powerful voice and guitar riffing which arouses the interest from the first hearing because it creates a double impact on the listener, especially in the songs Everybody's Fool, Tourniquet, My Last Breath. <br /> The simultaneous use of distortional guitars, violins, electro-beeps and piano reveal the modern path rock has taken.  The piano parts (which in reality are really simple to play) are the key to the outstanding result especially on Bring Me To Life, Going Under and Taking Over Me. The piano ballads My Immortal and Hello illustrate the band's ability of piano-ballad song writing, very rarely seen in the music industry these days in such a level. <br /> The band approaches every song using the same pattern and the same technique in every instrument to relay to the audience their aspect. That's why all the songs seem to be repetitive. An experienced listener can easily distinguish the differences between the songs. After a while the sense of repetition evanesces. <br /> The real diamond in the album is Haunted. It includes all the qualities mentioned above all in one packet. The guitar solo near the end of the song is at least breathtaking. The bass player is giving all he's got during this solo too. The goth chorus at the end really takes you off... <br /> The lyrics on every song are surely well thought. Fast and simple, right to the point. Youcan easily understand the suffering of the writer and his cry for help. <BR> <BR> One negative thing of this album is that the band turned 180 degrees away from the style they introduced on Origin album (highly recommended too), but maybe this has to do with the way the producer wanted them to sound. Maybe in their future album they will include some songs from Origin, like Lies, Even In Death and Anywhere. <br /> Another nudge is that the singer cannot perform nearly the same as in the studio when singing live. Maybe it has to do with her age or her mood when singing. She is a good performer and many times you can feel that her voice has big potential but she looks like she cannot keep her singing steady during the whole time of her performance. <br /> There are a lot of reviews insisting on Lacuna Coil being Evanescence predecessors. This could be true if Evanescence's music was hard rock or even heavy metal. But in reality their music is one step above. It is a new stand in the music stardom. Their music stucks in your head and is there to stay. In the future new bands will emerge with similar sound. <br /> Do not be afraid to trust Evanescence. They are here to stay. Buy their albums. It is not too late...

B00004YTXH|4.0|This is a fine compilation of Morricone's movie themes that contains several tracks for soundtracks that are difficult to find these days (such as &quot;Hamlet&quot; and &quot;Frantic&quot;), as well as his more famous compositions (&quot;The Mission&quot; and the forever repeated &quot;The Good, the Bad, &amp; the Ugly&quot;).<br /><br />All the tracks are original recordings, except one. For some unknown reason, the title track of &quot;For a Few Dollars More&quot; is represented by a substandard arrangement by the Geoff Love Orchestra. Considering that &quot;For a Few Dollars More&quot; is one of those tracks that is not often compiled, finding this version instead of the original was a significant disappointment.<br /><br />And although it doesn't detract from the music, the track &quot;Chi Mai&quot; is listed variously as being from &quot;The Life and Times of David Llyod George&quot; and &quot;Maddelena.&quot; A few quick internet searches revealed it was used in both, as well as &quot;Le Professionel&quot; (which is where I knew it from). It would have been nice to have this little discrepency explained.

0393312836|5.0|This is Burgess's most famous novel, largely to the controversial treatment of it by Kubrick. As with most famous novels, there is the danger of disappointment because they are so hyped up. This was the case with me, until I was about halfway through. Then, because it was sufficiently different from the movie, I realised that it was good beyond the hype. And overall, it is the fact that Burgess has condensed quite a lot of ideas onto about 150 easy pages that makes this book a great read. If it was much longer (like so many other thematic books of novels-of-ideas) it would lose its tolchok...<br />Speaking of tolchoks, this would be the most challenging part of the novel - nadsat. The narrator is Alex, a juvenile delinquent living in a somewhat not-too-distant-and-certainly-dystopian future, where Britain is quite close to being a police state and where crime is such that the &quot;delinquencies&quot; of little Alex involve rape, murder and other examples of ultra-violence. Furthermore, the teens in this future speak nadsat, a slang peppered with Russian expressions. The first page should be quite a shock to those who don't know Russian (and if like me you do know it, there's the feature of figuring out what Russian word the Anglicised string of letters is meant to symbolise). Anyhow, you can think of it as a cloze passage and in a few pages, you should be fluent. If not, there are excellent resources on the internet, such as Wikipedia's nadsat entry. As for the purpose of this deliberate difficulty, it's actually worthwhile in highlighting the superficial and brutal subculture Alex lives in.<br />The novel is divided into three parts. Part 1 is Alex and his friends running amok and basically doing what they like. Part 2 is Alex in prison, and the famous Ludovico's &quot;rehabilitation&quot; technique. Part 3 is Alex back in the world, with a difference.<br />The book is seen to explore free-will and the choice to do good and evil. As such, we climb into the head ofsomeone who would most likely be described as a sociopath in conventional terms. He commits acts of violence simply because this is what he genuinely enjoys. And to go against the stereotype of the low-IQ bum, Alex is considerably intelligent and has a true passion for classical music. This sets up the background of a world-gone-mad. Then, Alex is treated with a technique that physically conditions him to be unable to do harm to anyone. Of course, the prison chaplain is against this but according to the Minister of the Interior, at least it will help in the seemingly-hopeless fight against violence.<br />Alex immediately becomes front-page material and a political pawn from all sides of the spectrum. Burgess examines the nature of our society, where politics and public perception are at the heart of every issue, and where both sides can become involved in dirty and partisan tactics. Also, the inconsistencies of the way society brings people up, incarcerates, punishes and attempts to rehabilitate criminals is a major idea.<br />The good thing is that it is unclear to me what moral lesson Burgess was actually attempting to espouse. He really lets the reader draw their own conclusions, more so than most writers. Finally, some of the early editions cut the last chapter, making the novel more edgy and dark (this is the case in the film). The last chapter (part 3, chapter 7) is an actual resolution. People have argued whether it makes the novel better or not. I think it does make it better because it casts irony on the tortuous attempts to rehabilitate Alex. But try to get an edition with the last chapter so you can see what Burgess intended originally.<br />Because it seems that somehow, violence is still with us *just a bit*, and the Clockwork opens up the recesses of evil and not-so-evil and its such a concise read makes it a great novel of the 20th century, and more original than many other dystopias.
0553213105|5.0|I've read three incredible books lately and NONE of them were remotely connected by theme, style, or author.  &quot;Song of Solomon&quot; was the first, &quot;The Bark of the Dogwood&quot; was the second, and &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; was the third. While all were excellent, P&amp;P was so great for me, simply because I didnt' expect it to be great. If you are like I was before reading this wonderful book, you probably can't imagine what could be so wonderful about Pride and Prejudice. How can it be interesting, you're thinking, when it's written in such a stuffy time period? I'll stick with my science fiction/romance novels/westerns, thank you very much. And it's true, you can't find any lusty young rogues, aliens, or gun fights, but that doesn't keep it from being an extremely wonderful book to read. The characters are full of life, the plot well constructed, and the entire story full of charm and humour. Don't be put off by the language either. It takes some getting used to, but once you're going it's not only completely natural, but makes today's English seem completely dull and simple. I cannot stress enough how wonderful this book is. Also try &quot;Bark of the Dogwood&quot; and &quot;Song of Solomon.&quot;
B000063DFN|5.0|This is one of the greatest heavy metal albums of all time. The album is actually genius, how they made metal the way it was in the 80's, with albums like this. As you can see from the album cover, the whole album has an overall Egyptian theme, especially the title track. This is where Iron maiden found their true sound. Not to say that Number Of The Beast wasn't genius, it's just that the evil lyrics are a little overboard. But this, what can I say? This is one of the best albums from the best band in the world. Get this and you'll be banging your head for the rest of your life.
B000005JA8|5.0|Take one part delta blues, some spoken word and poetry,  free rock, and  mix liberally with 5 to 600 tabs of acid and you might get something approximating Trout Mask Replica.  This album sounds insane at first listen, as though the musicians had no clue to what they were doing.  On closer inspection you'll find some extremely well thought out ensemble playing by one of the best and most eccentric bands in rock. Its polyrhythmically complex, harsh, sometimes tuneful and always interesting.  The Magic Band were originally blues players but they certainly didn't stop there.  Much of this music is beyond description, its gotta be heard to be understood.  The guitars will both play different sometimes clashing riffs with the bass player somewhere in the middle.  The drummer Drumbo (John French) is one of the most original players I've ever heard.  He's invented a new language for the rock drum set, its incredibly polyrhythmic and uses every drum with near equal emphasis.  Captain Beefheart rides over the top with his bizarre lyrics, amateur saxaphone and incredible voice.  This is the album that artists as diverse as Andy Summers of the Police, XTC's Andy Partridge and DEVO have stated as being a major influence on their musical development.  There would be no Pere Ubu without the good Captain and crew.  Most people are not going to like this album, its not an easy listen by any means.  Those with open ears and mind will find the experience rewarding though.<br /><br />Edit: I would say that modern progressive and death metal such as Gorguts, Meshuggah, The Mars Volta and Animals As Leaders owe something to Captain Beefheart as well, certainly where rhythm is concerned and the good Captain and crew created this in 1969.
B0000634EV|5.0|This is one of the best southern sludge/doom albums ever to be released. It is formed by ex-members of Pantera, COC, and Crowbar. It's absolutely wonderful. It's sort of like a modern-day Black Sabbath, with more of a Southern kick. There are suprisingly quite a few ballads, but they are all good. Standout tracks include the heavily Led Zeppelin-influnced 'Landing on the Mountains of Meggido', 'Lysergik Funeral Procession', and 'Beautifully Depressed'.
B000007PSR|5.0|This is all the GOOD Stuff from Madcap Laughs. These are basically outtakes and other versions of songs off Madcap Laughs. This really shows Syd in his real light. Not the polished finished albums but the raw stuff off old albums. It is not as clean and shows Syds true musical Tallent. which may be hard for some to listen to, but if that is you you probabbly don't like Syd anyway. True fans must have.
B000002JOH|5.0|HERE IS ANOTHER MUST-HAVE METAL RELEASE FROM THE SOUTHERN GUYS OF PANTERA. THIS IS PROBABLY THEIR MOST FAMOUS ALBUM, AND ONE OF THEIR BEST. AFTER THE MILD SUCCESS OF COWBOYS FROM HELL IN 1990, THEY TONED THEIR SOUND DOWN A LITTLE BIT AND SOUNDED LESS LIKE A POWER METAL BAND AND MORE OF A THRASH ONE. BUT THEY WERE NEVER REALLY THRASH, JUST USING INFUENCES, WHILE THEIR MAIN SOUND WAS MORE INFLUENCED BY BLACK SABBATH AND KISS. THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST ALBUMS I OWN. EVERY SONG BUSTS INTO PURE HEAVY POWER. STADOUT TRACKS ARE: 'WALK', 'THIS LOVE', AND 'MOUTH FOR WAR'.
B0000DBJDM|5.0|This is a great experiment with live concert recording and a movie where the only person at the show is you. A very good look at what floyd is about and how they did it. It is sort of like a bunch of music videos wraped into one until you look at the Directors Cut witch is all the good behind the sceenes stuf. A must have for any floyd fan!

B0001AP12G|5.0|this album is not only one of the best this year but no doubt in my mind one of the best in a decade, ever sicne the birth of hip-hip/rap. kanye west isn't afraid to talk about jesus and i really admire that. every song had it's own little supurb beat and the way the he carries himself throughout the album is amzing. his words can touch any human being on the face of the planet. htey all have their own little significant touch to them and i really love htat about kanye west. please buy this album for kanye because he really deserves it. if i could i would give it more satrs than five. some awesome songs on the cd are family buisiness- great song about the real importnace of your family. can touch any person really deeply telling a great stroy of family and at the same time you can actually enjoy the song. work it out- awesome beat and i love the way that kanye west carries the beats throught the song and the raps. the way that he flows through this song it TERRIFIC. we don't dare- it's another awsome song with a great beat, and as well a good story and rymes that run throughout this song. listen to it twice just to relaly understand the meaning of the song. when it all falls down- overpalyed on mtv and made the song really old pretty fast, but it's still an awesome song in it's own glory. through the wire- aweosme song, i really admire the fact that he recored the song with the wire thing in his mouth. that shows that noithing can stop kanye west from continuing on his path. never let me down- great song, and another good beat. great guest appearacne by jay-z and great lyrics that once again tell a great story. jesus wlaks- great song. i really admire hte whole jesus theme, we really need that in today's world. with all of the drugs, shootings, and hte bad things, it helkps so much to know that there is ome mucics out htere htat can be some salvation. breath in breath out- a great and fun song. kanye west kinda' goes back to rappin' about money hose and rims again as he says but i think that it's a cool song that can be a great paarty or bounce theme. slow jamz- it has been played a whole lot but i still listen to it becasue i think that it is a great song with a great guest performance by twista' and jamey foxx as well. kanye west does a little bit of that love song htat every album, almost every album, has and he succeeds hte whoel time throught this song. school spirit- a very fun song that makes you wanna' jump up and dance along with it. i lvoe the way that kanye west syas everything in htis song. hte beginning is bouncin' and then he really get's goin' and he knows as well as everybody else does nothing can stop him. get em' high- once again kanye west goes back to that rappers delight kinda' song with the bad kinda' feeling to this but somehow hte song still seems kinda' clean to me. the skits in this song also seem to be very touching they tell you to stay in school and keep your nose up to god, great album.

B000059PR5|4.0|The Day After (Nicholas Meyer, 1983)<br />Recently, motivated by a strong desire to see Threads again, I've been going through a kind of craving for nuclear-holocaust-flick nostalgia. Seeing The Day After again was my first foray back into the world of atom-bombs-blowing-stuff-up. I hadn't seen it since its original television broadcast more than twenty years previous, and was surprised at how well it holds up.<br />The excellent ensemble cast is headed by the late Jason Robards (Magnolia, Enemy of the State, etc.) and John Lithgow (Shrek, Third Rock from the Sun, etc.) as a doctor and scientist, respectively, at two college campuses in the midwest in the aftermath of a nuclear holocaust. (Said nuclear holocaust happens, as one might expect, early in the film, but not as early as you might figure; unlike modern-day films, stuff made a quarter of a century ago actually took time to build its characters before getting into the plot.) Also along for the ride are Robards' right-hand nurse, played by JoBeth Williams (Poltergeist); a family whose house was close to one of the bombed missile silos, the Dahlbergs; Lithgow's right-hand man Aldo (Stephen Furst of Animal House fame), oh, we'll just run down some names: John Cullum, Bibi Besch, Steve Guttenberg, Lori Lethin, Amy Madigan, Jeff East, Dennis Lipscomb, Arliss Howard... you get the idea. This may have been a made-for-TV movie, but didn't shirk on the starpower. Also, look for uncredited appearances by Wayne Knight (Seinfeld's Newman), David Kaufman (Presidio Med, Pearl Harbor), John Lafayette (various movies based on Tom Clancy novels), and the late director Herk Harvey (in his first screen role since Carnival of Souls twenty years before, and the last before his death in 1996). Meyer and co. didn't scrimp on the casting budget.<br />It shows. The whole thing is exceptionally well-acted, though sometimes it's a bit tough to believe these folks are really as devastated as one would think survivors of an all-out nuclear war should be (and that a house situated right next to a bombed missile silo would still be standing just because Steve Guttenberg happens to be hiding there provides a moment of unintentional humor). Robards is probably the best at communicating this, especially in the movie's final scene. The makeup job on Robards was also not scrimped on; by the end of the film, he could be something out of a Romero film. For that matter, the makeup crew did an all-around fantastic job; by the end of the flick, Steve Guttenberg was unrecognizable. (I have heard it opined-- well, okay, inside my own head-- that perhaps he should have kept the makeup on when doing Three Man and a Baby.)<br />The point was brought up in a recent discussion that perhaps those born after the early eighties will probably be too young to really grasp the terrors of the Cold War to those of us old enough to remember \\"Duck... and Cover!\\" So perhaps not the best flick to get your kids to thinking about how bad off you were in the old days (for that, use Threads), but it's definitely worthwhile on the nostalgia-trip angle, or if you just like watching Jason Robards act with an equally fantastic cast around him. ****ar war should be (and that a house situated right next to a bombed missile silo would still be standing just because Steve Guttenberg happens to be hiding there provides a moment of unintentional humor).

B0001Z52RU|5.0|I picked up this movie the day it came out on DVD expecting a reprise of the good film I saw in the theatre.  Critics did not favor this movie, mostly due to an ending they determined was inappropriate and not up-to-par with the intensity of the rest of the film.  The Director's Cut successfully mends the errors of the Theatrical release.  The Director's Cut (on side A of this DVD) was a more complete portrait of what the creators were attempting with this film, and the ending is a completely different approach to the finale.  Regardless of your opinion of the original film, the Director's Cut fixed Theatrical flaws and created a great experience beyond that of an already decent movie in theatres.
0142004235|3.0|Steinbeck took his turn at the Cain and Abel story, turning it into a towering epic of the westward journey of Americans to the promised land of California.  The book is richly detailed, and certainly Steinbeck's most ambitious effort, but ultimately fails to deliver on its central theme.  The book is a continuous battle between opposing forces, beginning with the Civil War and ending with land development and the railroad system in California. Caught in the middle of this sprawling epic is a pair of brothers, who find themselves living out an eternal grudge match. The supporting characters are the most interesting in this novel, such as the Chinese cook who becomes so involved in the story of Cain and Abel that he pursues the topic with his elders in San Francisco's China Town, and even searches out a direct Hebrew translation to resolve the meaning of the parable.  He finds that the intended word was \\"may\\" and not \\"shall\\" overcome sin, thereby reaffirming man's free will. But, for the most part this is a heavy handed novel, falling short of Steinbeck's better novels, \\"In Dubious Battle\\" and \\"The Winter of Our Discontent.\\"

B0001AP12G|5.0|This CD marked a new rapper on the charts. This rapper is called Kanye West. He was producing tracks for singers but now he is finally coming out with his debut album. This CD is as good and revolutionary as Dr Dre's. Kayne West actually know how to rap and his lyrics makes sense. Althought some beats maybe consider boring but the lyrics and the message Kayne try to tell us gets throught. I just bought this CD for 15 bucks and every dollar is worth it.<br />Songs Recommended...<BR>We Dont Care<br />Jesus Walk<BR>Never Let Me Down<BR>Breath In Breath Out<BR>Slow Jamz<BR>Through The Wire

0743435729|4.0|The second book about Captain Honor Harrington follows the same model as its predecessor, &quot;On Basilisk Station&quot;: Honor Harrington receives an assignment from the Kingdom of Manticore around a planet where the enemy Republic of Haven has political interests. Intrigue with natives and battles both on ground in the space follow, with Honor proving her command mettle in massive ship-to-ship duels written in precise and exciting language with extreme attention to technical details. If you liked &quot;On Basilisk Station,&quot; you'll find more of the same enjoyment here.<br />This time, Honor heads to the planet of Grayson to oversee a strategically important treaty. There's a serious problem, however: Grayson was founded by religious fundamentalists who see women as inferior, and getting the people of the planet to trust her or take her seriously is difficult. Meanwhile, Grayson faces a war with a splinter faction that moved to another planet and is even more radical and dangerous -- and they are negotiating with the Republic of Haven and have secret plans to use Haven's technology to assist their dreams of conquering Grayson.<br />The ship battles are again excellent, and there are more of them than in the previous book. The best action scenes, however, are some great ground duels and marine battles -- author David Weber does a fine job keep the action varied. He also does good work with the conflict between Honor and the prejudiced people of Grayson, showing how they can overcome their bigotry. Weber adds many shades of gray to people we might accept as irredeemable when we first meet them. This dramatic conflict helps to flesh out what is otherwise a straightforward military science-fiction/space opera. Good fun.
0375432302|5.0|I just got this book less than a month ago and i finished it within a week, balancing my time from work and other household responsibilities to soak my mind with this masterpiece. No, you cannot take this book as the holy gospel, and if you are swayed by this book, your faith is truely weak to begin with. Though as a man who is interested in the truth, i am now very interested in the topic this book covers. The true Holy Grail, and the &quot;cover up&quot; that was posed by Constantine centuries after the death of Christ.<br />Back to the book, the story itself is so captivating that it keeps you glued to the pages for hours at a time. Though some of the escapes and plot twists took me aback as perhaps a bit too coincidental for reality to really hold true, a reader need to see past that to see the genius at work. The cyptic nature of the puzzles and the scientific brilliance that is Da Vinci is enough to addict a curious mind to the outcome of this story, and once the finale comes and goes, you only wish there was more.<br />For those of you who are exploring Dan Brown for the first time (like me), my next suggestion would be Angels and Demons, which is the first adventure of the main character in The Da Vinci Code.<br />If this book can single handedly grip me, a man with little time to spare, imagine what it can do to you. I warn, before you start this book, cancel any plans you had for the next few days...else you might be fashionably late...if you show up at all.
038073186X|5.0|Shutter Island is a terrifying novel that chilled me to the bone.  It played the hugest trick on me of any book that I have ever read.  During the last couple of chapters I had this feeling of absolute disbelief - could this really be happening? Surely the book couldn't end this way.  Please don't let it end this way!  But it did.  Bloody hell, I thought the ending to Hannibal by Thomas Harris was nasty.  In this book, the ending is fiendish.<br />The characters were all described very well and with lots of imagination.  Teddy Daniels is a US Marshal and the year is 1954.  He is investigating Shutter Island with his new partner US Marshal Chuck Aule.  You feel great sympathy for Teddy as his past is revealed - the death of his lovely wife Dolores and his violent clashes in the war.  All this is written about in the most beautiful language.  The scenes where Teddy goes back over his overpowering love for Dolores are particularly poignant.<br />Dennis Lehane draws you in to the plot by creating vivid characters, scenery, intrigue, mystery and clues at every turn.  And then he calmly proceeds to turn everything inside out in the most shocking way possible. The plot was terrifyingly plausible and the last couple of chapters so hideous that they defy words.<br />Overall this is a great novel.  Great in its ability to deceive and shock.  Can I honestly say that I enjoyed reading it?  Well, with tears falling down my cheeks as I got through the final chapters, I came to the conclusion that no, it had not been an enjoyable reading experience!  Somehow I suspect Lehane never intended it to be.  But he did a fantastic job of scaring the life out of me.<br />JoAnne
0780020685|2.0|Watching the 'direction' in this movie, and others by this director, is like seeing the first ever 'lace-up' shoe or the first ever internal-combustion engine. You may happen to appreciate that the 'overused' ideas, employed in the film, were used there for the first time; the originality pervading the movie from beginning to end alongside gritty and convincing acting. However, it is still subject to a style of story-delivery that was original 50 years ago - that modern film watchers are jaded with.<BR>To avoid a long spiel: if you hate black and white; if long silent scenes with no music overplay; if obscured scenes and dramatic angles are not your thing, you just won't enjoy this film.

1400032717|5.0|Who would ever expect a murder mystery about the neighbor's dead dog to make a good read?  Certainly not me, especially as one who had not read a novel in many, many years.  The title alone might discourage someone from buying this book.  A better title might be &quot;WHY MY BOOK ABOUT AUTISM IS TITLED THE CURIOUS INCIDENT OF THE DOG IN THE NIGHT-TIME&quot;.  :=)<br />I bought the book after noticing that it had numerous references sprinkled throughout the book of interesting mathematical concepts.  As a high school math teacher, I thought it would be an interesting book to recommend to my students.<br />As it turns out, the main focus of the book seems to be to help people better understand in inner thinkings of individuals afflicted with autism.  It is a must-read for anyone interested in autism, but at the same time intertwining an interesting story, some solid mathematical concepts, numerous &quot;life lessons&quot;, and even a good &quot;joke&quot; or two, British-style, of course.<br />I definitely recommend this book.  It is an easy read; the 226 pages will go by quickly.  You will even get to learn all the prime numbers from 2 to 233, which are the chapter numbers.  My only objection was the frequent use of the f-word throughout the book and thus would restrict my recommendation of the book to more mature readers.  Since movie rights have already been purchased, I will anxiously await its making.

Then 'Soul' hit the shops and composer George used 'rectify' in &quot;Think For yourself&quot; and suddenly basic literacy was hip.<br />Dating the daughter of the manager of a Harrow record store at the time, we concluded a major snog to the soundtrack of the 4-somes' latest a whole 12 hours before the album went on sale to the rest of the grockles.  Gives lust a good name.<br />Apart from Norman Greenbaum's &quot;Spirit in the Sky&quot;, I reckon this was the album to which I bedded more virginal sweeties than any other sounds of the season.  Talk about a summer of seduction.<br />If *only* someone had invented back then some way of skipping the appalling atonal offering of the nasal Starkey. Sacr? Bleu!

B0001Z52RU|5.0|I sometimes sit around and think of what would have happened if I had done it differently.  When I saw the trailer for this movie the very first time, I was excited.  I was excited because it was something that I, and probably a great majority of people, can relate to.<br />The Butterfly Effect is definitely one of the best movies I have seen in a while.  The whole movie is intense, keeping you off of the edge of your seat.  The acting is not bad at all, with the comparison of Ashton Kutcher's character as opposed to his comedic character in The 70's Show.  Critics definitely underrated it, but it is understandable because this movie is not really the type of art that would be in the Oscar's.  It is more of a film for the people who watch a movie for the overall essence of it and its messages conveyed to life.  A person reviewed The Butterfly Effect to me as a crappy movie because &quot;it didn't make sense.&quot;  If you did not like, you probably did not understand it.<br />Even though the theatrical version was good, the Director's Cut is even better.  I recommend to give the Director's Cut a try even if you did not like it.  The storyline is more complete and more powerful.

B0001Z52RU|5.0|At first i Didnt know what to expect from this movie i didnt think Kutcher could pull off being serious but boy was i wrong. This movie really makes u think. Its great and suspenseful. in this movie there are three time periods which they go back and forth through out the movie. Evan is the main character Kutcher plays him when he is in college. It starts off when evan is 7 evan has blackouts where he cant remember what just happened. His father had the same thing and is in an institution for crazy people. a series of tragedies happen and many peoples lives get ruined when evan realizes he can go back in time and change the past by reading his journals he wrote for 13 years. Every time he does this things just keep getting worse i dont wanna tell you anymore about this movie because the whole thing is rele  surprising and great and it would ruin the movie  but u have to watch this movie if u like thriller suspense
B00020HEG6|5.0|This is probably the best of the 3 soundtracks to the Harry Potter films. Being a fan of the books, the movie throughly disappointed me... but the music never ceases to amaze. I love every track especially #5 (Double Trouble) and #6 (Buckbeak's Flight). Track #5 uses a great verse from Shakespeare's &quot;Macbeth&quot; and gives the film an air of mystery and dark magic... and this installment is one of the darkest in the series (well book 5 is darker, but we're not talking about book 5). Track #6 just lifts my heart and gives me chills and goose bumps.... the same feeling hit me both times I saw the movie. The piece just captures the raw emotion, joy, and freedom of Harry at that moment.<br />I enjoy the use of what seems to be tin flutes and the almost medieval quality of some of the pieces. It's just a wonderful score, probably one of William's best works.<br />I definately recommend anyone to purchase this... even if you don't like Harry Potter, you will love the enchanting themes found in this score.

B000002UAX|2.0|Back in the USSR, Dear Prudence, ObLadDi ObLaDa, While My Guitar Gently Weeps, Martha My Dear, I'm So Tired, Blackbird, I Will, Julia, Birthday, Yer Blues and Revolution.  The 12 finished quality songs according to producer George Martin that should have comprised the Beatles 1968 release.  Had they listened to him, this would have been a 4-star album, and the remaining 17 partially finished songs, demos, and experimentation would have been relegated to Anthology where they belong.
0345440900|1.0|Unless you are training a puppy, don't bother with this one.  At best, it is shaky advice.  At worst, it is irresponsible and dishonest.    The irresponsible part:  Putting a newborn on feeding schedules and sleep training is tremendously bad advice and can endanger their health.  Her suggestion that, right from the start, you should be helping your baby be \\"independent\\" is outrageous.  The first three months are commonly referred to as \\"the fourth trimester\\" for a reason.  Babies have tremendous needs and need to be able to depend on you at any time.  This glorified governess seems to think that this inconvenience should be avoided.  Well, guess what, newborns are a lot of work.  Grow up and take care of your baby.  It doesn't last that long.    The dishonest part:  How this woman claims to be a lactation consultant is beyond me.  All she does is suggest reasons not to do it.  She cites breastfeeding being \\"all the rage\\" as somehow trendy, not based on study after study after study proving the overwhelming superiority of breastmilk over formula.  Did you ever notice the little type in the corner of the formula commercial?  It reads \\"breastmilk is best\\".  Even the manufacturer has to tell you this because it is absolutely IRREFUTABLE.    Then she goes on to say that if you don't want your breasts to be saggier, you should probably pass on nursing.  If you really think the perkiness of your boobs surpasses doing the right thing for your child, again, grow up.  Breasts are not for decoration.  If you choose not to breastfeed, make that choice for a true reason, not how you look in a halter top.    It all boils down to this.  Ms. Hogg (so aptly named, in my view) is not a pediatrician.  She is not a psychiatrist.  She is a former nanny.  She claims to respect babies, but I don't see any proof of that.  She claims to be a lactation consultant - for whom?  Enfamil?
B0000DJZ7W|5.0|This album is just perfect! Among all of Celine's albums (in French and in English) this one is the best. I'm glad that she had released another great album in French. This is surely a must-have not only for fans but also for everyone who enjoys listing to good music.

B00006879E|5.0|They are an awesome white funk band and I can honestly say every song on &quot;Songs About Jane&quot; is a winner, led by &quot;Harder&quot; and &quot;This,&quot; but I also love &quot;She Will.&quot; Because I bought the vinyl LP version (just $13.99), I'm rewarded with full 100% hi-fidelity three-dimensional sound and depth - something you just can't get with CD's. This is a funk album, don't shortchange yourself with the flat, incomplete sound of digital audio. And Maroon 5? They WILL be loved...

1401200842|4.0|Batman & Jim Lee. That's all I need to know to decide to buy the book. I used to assume that given his dynamic and action-oriented drawing style, it would be weird to see Jim Lee tackle the dark, grim and gritty portrayal of Batman's world. The story is just decent. I see that it neither has depth nor good character development. But I don't care, I bought it for the art alone and the art really delivers! I could spend hours savoring the illustration alone and not caring about the story. Sorry Jeph Loeb but if the sales of this book is great it's because of Jim Lee.
B00005JKN9|5.0|this movie had great action and set. the story was good and so are the extras on the dvd. disapointments are that there will be no directors cut, no deleted scenes on this dvd, and leonardo dicaprio. even if they had to get a big star for the lead role, there are so many more fitting actors for this role than the pretty-boy dicaprio.
B0001NBMBC|1.0|If you are a Slipknot fan this cd is going to shock you. When i bought the cd i knew the music was going to be different but when i popped it into my cd player i was hearing something i never thought i would hear slipknot doing......acoustic. it was a huge shock Slipknot is one of the best bands ever if you want to get a Slipknot cd i suggest &quot;Iowa&quot; or their self titled cd &quot;Slipknot&quot;.
B000002UAX|5.0|please dont pay any attention to the one star reviews for this great beatles cd.buy it and enjoy like i did.
B0000069NM|5.0|Almost every track on this album makes me want to get up and dance... and I don't usually do that sort of thing. This is modern funk at its best. The improv by everybody is as good as is the groove. If your looking for complicated lines and advanced harmonic ideas, this probably isn't your album, but with a few nicely placed harmonic, and rhythmic suprises this album reigns as one of my All Time Favs.
B00006HBUB|3.0|&quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; is okay.  It's not that great of a film and it's not that bad.  As much as I despise him, I have to say that Matthew Lillard does an excellent job as Shaggy.  He's the best character in this flick.  Linda Cardellini is good as Velma, but she has a couple of lines(ex. &quot;Let's get jinky with it&quot;) that are just atrocious.  Freddie Prinze, Jr. wasn't necessarily miscast as Fred, but the character was portrayed in a way that doesn't really reflect the character from the original show.  Sarah Michelle Gellar was annoying as Daphne.  Nevermind the fact that she pulled out the old kung-fu ala &quot;Buffy,&quot; she's just not convincing enough in this role.  The CGI Scooby was just that, a CGI Scooby.  He looks fake, but dogs can't talk either, so I'm okay with that.  His character is actually pretty good.<br />The best part of this film is the opening scene with the Luna ghost.  It looked as if it were straight out of the old series.  Everything heads south from there.  The characters, excepting Shaggy and Scooby, are weightless.  The nasties are just plain silly and the jokes resort to sophomoric humor.  I'm sure every thirteen year-old boy in the crowd got a laugh from the farting contest between Shaggy and Scooby.  A few cuss words were thrown around, and Daphne puts a whipping on a wrestler-type baddie.<br />Overall, this film works well with kids between the ages of eleven and sixteen.  Younger kids MIGHT get scared by the bad guys, and the language can get a little rough for the really young'uns.  For us older folks who grew up with the series, it's nice to see Scooby and the gang in a live-action format.  However, I feel that this movie tries too hard to make itself appeal to all age groups.  I also think that the director should have decided on whether he was making a nostalgic flick, a spoof, or an updated version using potty humor.<br />It's watchable and somewhat funny, but you might want to rent this one before laying any money down for it.down for it.
0446678430|5.0|This installment in the Rich Dad series Retire Young Retire Rich is also subtitled How To Get Rich Quickly and Stay Rich Forever.<br />Kiyosaki tells us that it took Rockefeller 16 years to become a billionaire in his time. And it took Bill Gates 10 years to reach the billion dollar status. However it took Mike Dell and Steve Case only 5 years to become billionaires. It's easier than ever.<br />In Retire Young Retire Rich, Kiyosaki pounds to death the concept of leverage. One chapter I found interesting was the leverage of generosity. Kiyosaki discusses how his Rich Dad taught him reciprocity and service. He states an age old law &quot;Give and you shall recieve.&quot; Kiyosaki says thath is rich dad taught him that if you want to be rich, you must first be willing to serve as many people as possible.<br />Aaccording to Kiyosaki, Rich Dad believed inthe law of reciprocity and in the idea of being generous was the best way to  becoming very, very rich.<br />Kiyosaki also talks about networks and network marketing. He goes on to discuss the power of networks and the importance of leverage ratios and goes on to say that you can b ecome exceptionally wealthy in a short period of time by doing so and at a fraction of the cost.<br />I noticed that Retire Young Retire Rich is recommended here by a Nationally recognized CPA. I am glad that people of quality appreciate Rich Dad's and Robert Kiyosaki's work.<br />I'm with a company that does business around the world and the most successful people I know are exercising the concepts espoused by Kiyosaki and are becoming very wealthy as a result.<BR>So can you.
B00005V3Z4|2.0|I expected more from this movie. I had so many friends tell me that it was unique and original...it was, but it sure wasn't good! If I wanted to be confused, impressed, and still enjoy a movie, I'd rent Lynch. &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; was a huge disappointment.
B0001KL5DA|4.0|The second season, honestly speaking, is not as fascinating as the first one. Yet, it still outstands lots of other dramas. The first season strikes many of us because of its style and the captivating characterisation. Each character is so distinguished from each other and each has his/her own charm. Once we are used to this formula, season 2 seems to offer less surprise to the audience. However, what season 2 does is to complicate the plot and the closure of each problem still brings joy to many of us.<br />The most brilliant part is season 2 is the adding of Taylor, Keith's niece into the drama. She evolves around David and Keith, sharing the homosexual secrets from the child's point of view. It's very interesting and the chemistry IS there. However, what disappoints me most, personally, is the pitification of Ruth, the mother in many episodes. Season 2 tends to victimize Ruth as a mother who shares one-way communication to her Russian lover, Nikolai, and the communication problem worsens between her and her children. Each episode tends to amplify this theme of victimhood and even in epsiode 13, her strong will is not restored completely. The whole season ends with a scene in which Claire and David hug their mother for love and concern when Nate is undergoing an AVM surgery.<br />Season 2 also brings more emphasis on the sidecast of the drama. Rico and his wife, Brenda's parents or even Brenda's new prostitute friend do stir a certain storm in the character's life. The second season extends the problems plotted in the first season - Keith and David's crisis, Nate's health problem, Brenda's obsession with wild sex, Ruth's incompetence and helplessness and Claire's cynicism. All these themes are touched in season 2.<br />Everybody who loves the first 2 seasons is waiting desperately for Season 3 on DVD. I just hope the studio does not take another 9 months to release their money-making discs.
6305508550|5.0|Office Space is a hilarious comedy directed by Mike Judge, the man who brought us Beavis and Butthead (he provided the voices for both characters as well), and starring Ron Livingston, Jennifer Aniston and featuring Mike Judge as an irritating restaurant manager.<br />The reason why many people have liked this film is because it touches upon an issue that is very common amongst people: hating work!<br />Peter Gibbons, played by Livingston, is our hero who is hassled by more than one manager about some memo that he says he recieved but forgot to implement, and hates the fact that his manager always picks on him to come in on Saturdays to finish some leftover work. One day, Gibbons goes to a shrink who hypnotizes him into a complete state of relaxation right before he, the shrink, has a heart attack. Peter becomes carefree. He goes to work when he feels like it wearing jeans and sandals. He even decides to stop going to work, stop paying his bills, and gets the courage to speak out calmly like everything is cool.<br />What happens next is up to you to find out.<br />If you seriously are being hassled at work by your employers, annoyed by everybody and everything from your obnoxious co-workers to that stupid printer that always jams, I really recommend you watch Office Space.<br />A
B00013PHGS|5.0|This is my favourite Air album right now.  Don't compare it to Moon Safari.  They're really dissimilar.  But they are both really good.  This is like soft electro-synth-pop.  And has some really catchy tracks.  Very good, if you like music.  Get this.
B00005NTJK|4.0|\\"Benefit\\" remains my favorite Jethro Tull recording, likely for all the wrong reasons. First, this was the first session where Ian Anderson and his band mates embraced folk music over the blues-tinged sound of their earlier work. Next, Martin Barre sounds engaged, determined, and focused on guitar, and his strong effort here keeps the music well grounded (something that is a failing on some Tull recordings in my opinion). Third, John Evan's returns to the fold and adds some stellar work on keyboards that greatly enrichs the sound. Fourth, I liked Glen Cornick's bass lines better than those by any other Tull bass player. Fifth, Ian Anderson crafted some of his best lyrics for \\"Benefit,\\" avoiding the ornate and tiring style on both his later and subsequent Jethro Tull recordings. Sixth, Mr. Anderson plays some inspired flute and contributes some excellent acoustic guitar that meshes wonderfully with Mr. Barre's amped up electric guitar.<br />This recording still retains enough of the edginess and eccentricity that caused Jethro Tull to stand out during the band's early years and that caught my ear way back when. I would recommend getting the remastered CD more for the improved sound quality than the bonus tracks (which aren't bad though).
B000002URV|5.0|I remember when i bought the first Enigma cd MCMXC AD i couldn't get enough. I have listened to this cd (no Lie) about a thousand times. It is sexy and pleasureable to the mind and ears. This is music you can really feel. I remember when i just couldn't wait for Enigma to release more of their music. Now I own every cd they have made. Every song on every cd I love, Enigma can do no wrong (or make a bad song). All cd's are my favorite I love Enigma I can't choose just one cd. I hope Michael Cretu continues to make music till he dies. Everyone I've introduced to Enigma has turned out to love it. Thanks Michael Cretu keep putting out the CD's and I'll keep buying.<BR>Definately invest your money and your listening pleasure in Enigma. If God made music this is what it would probably sound like.
B000001Y5X|5.0|While Manson's Portrait may appear immature in comparison to his later achievements, it still stands as one of his best albums in my opinion.  Manson's goal with portrait was to go out and prove the American dream is bullsh*t.  While to the average listener, its strong points may not stand out that well.  If you don't understand some of the song meanings, such as Get your Gunn and Wrapped in Plastic, then I suggest that you pick up Marilyn Manson's autobiography The Long Hard Road out Of Hell as well.  The album is different from the normal Manson that we all know and love today in that this was before all the makeup, it has a slight punk atmosphere/influence, and the overall sound.      Despite what several people say about Twiggy's Bass being top notch, Twiggy didn't play anything on this album at all, he was just in the photo shoot and therefore credited as the Bass Player.  In the notes shown in the sleeve (Go ahead, look) it clearly says ALL BASS PLAYED BY GIDGET GEIN.  He was kicked out due to a severe heroin addiction.  We also have the original drummer Sara Lee Lucas.  Lucas has always been labeled as being a horrible drummer, but I don't think he's that bad.  True, Ginger Fish is better drummer, but Lucas's drums on Portrait are a large portion of what makes the songs so catchy.  Daisy Berkowitz delver's a solo from his guitar on each song and like Lucas; is responsible for the catchyness shown on the album.  Unfortunately, once again, if you read Manson's Autobiography, you'll find out just how much of an idiot Berkowitz was.     The only 2 tracks that I may consider filler are Cyclops and My Monkey.  The only thing that I really enjoy on Cyclops is Daisy's guitar solo.  While My Monkey WILL seem weird/sick/twisted anytime you listen to it, if you read Manson's autobiography you will find out how important it is.  But there isn't anything on it (at all) that makes it pop into my head or feel an urge to listen to it.  So you get an album with 11/13 great songs.      Portrait shines in a way that no other of their albums do.  Because of the immaturity presented on the album, it never gets old.  I can listen all the way through without playing the skip button, with sometimes Cyclops and My Monkey being exceptions.  If you like Manson then you can't pass this up!    An additional note: Dope Hat has to be one of the most addicting songs ever!
B00020HEG6|1.0|I LOVE HARRY POTTER TO DEATH!!!! I think its the asomest books and movies in the world! I've read the book maybe like 75 times.

B00003OSSL|5.0|We just saw this dvd in tv for the second time in 2 years. The first time we saw it we saw it with great apreciation, the second time, we were so glad for the oportunity to see it again, reaping the same amount of pleasure once more, so much so, that we went into internet to find a dvd, Amazon of course.<br />At the same time we looked at reviews, here and there, and were shocked to find hardly anyone likes this film. Astonishing indeed!<br />Ford, as always, true to the role, perfect; the woman Thomas was superb, (we knew her from English Patient). Sooo much feeling! Pollack, what more can one ask for. How complex you americans are sometimes. Astonishing!

0694524441|5.0|This is one of the best books I've ever listened to. And that's saying alot since I drive 20 hours a week and listened to books almost constantly. The author's writing style is very simple and direct which is such a delight. So many writers today get wrapped up in trying to find &quot;tastier&quot; words to describe very simple ideas or actions. I recommend this book whole heartily.
B0000541AM|5.0|LMAO....This movie owned badly.  It came out a long time ago, but I saw it on DVD about a month ago.  Gangs from the 70's are sooooooooo much different than gangs today.  Like we might have bloods, and crips today.  But the gangs back then actually had meaning, and a concept.  A nice example is the Orphans.  They all dressed up in raggidy !@# clothing, and kept to themselves.  They had a gang like, they all dressed up in baseball uniforms, and wielded bats as weapons.  Also, guns were rare back then.  I mean some people had guns, but when the term \\"Are you packing\\" was said, people had whatever they can fight with.  2X4, Bath, Pipes, Bricks.  Thats real....lol
B0001MDP3G|5.0|Renee Zellwinger was very deservant of the Oscar.  She was awesome.  I love it when actors/actresses can transition from one part to another and give their performance a realistic view.  She did exactly that.

B00004W510|5.0|I think so. They absorbed Dylan's lyrical approach completely, threw away the bad parts, and made it better by adding musicianship...unlike the Beatles, they didn't dick around with psychedelic delusions, but made ordinary life wonderful instead.   This album is so good I almost can't stand it. It is literally overflowing with integrity, strength, and hope. It simply doesn't get any better than this. How dare they write songs this good.
B0000AGWJ7|4.0|Since I dwell in South Africa, I had to to steal this release from the the handy ol' internet, sorry. The CD takes a while to get used to since they squash every single idea they have into a song, very complex.The guitarists have studied and mastered their metal, this is what makes this band so diverse and entertaining for me.From turbo Megadeth riffs to beautiful acoustic sections, to blistering solos (Kerry king,go eat ure heart out)  ,some melodic death metaland screamo. Ohhhh yes, the list goes on, I did say diverse didn't I. <br />Shadows' vox adds to the diversity. 'Maiden screams, Hardcore shouts and emoish vox. Anyway, everyone in the band is very talented which makes for good songs.<br />Not one song on this CD sounds similiar to each other and is hard to prescribe this CD to certain fans of different genres.But pick it up anyway, or steal it if u have any doubts in buying this, coz u will probaply worship it<br />ps. if u play metal guitar u have to listen to this, its f**king amazing!

B000002J1M|4.0|I have listened to this album since my Aunt brought it home in 1974 with the Lamb - I was only 9 and was amazed by the stories they told. Now, 30 years later and a songwriter/musician/engineer, I still find their music amazing and timeless. The lyrics are as enthralling as the musicianship - all top-rate. By today's standards of recording (compressing all dynamics out of every note), the album does seem quieter and not as &quot;beefy&quot;, but so does &quot;brown eyed girl&quot; and many other classics that used good melodies, lyrics, and musical abilities to become the classics we love. This album, and their others, were &quot;harry potter&quot; and &quot;Hobbit&quot; for my ears.
B0001ZX0PG|3.0|Alright I'm not feeling a movie that ends the way this one did. I was completely down for personal retribution for the murder of the daughter. I felt his pain. I even cried with him. I, too, thought Tim Robins was a little suspect. But I get hung up on this simple scene from the movie: When Penn was in the morgue looking at the daughter, he swore he would avenge the daughter's death. Swore on his own life. Did he do that? Hell no! He, instead, killed a man that not only didn't kill his daughter, but did rid the world of a freakin' molester. I thought that was the dumbest thing on earth. Then Penn's wife just accepts it. Like it's nothing to kill another person, let alone a fairly innocent man. Then let's just get our freak on right before the damn parade because I think you're an awesome father for lying to your dead daughter over her corpse before the funeral. Horrible! Tim Robins deserved the Supporting Actor win though. It's unfortunate that his character met the fate he did, but I suppose it's wrong to kill a molester if you were molested? Eastwood dropped the ball on the moral value of this movie BAD. 3 stars because of the great acting by Robins. Everyone else was a disappointment.
B00005RERU|5.0|Brando fine as director. He does excellent turn as the Rio<BR>character in the film. Malden, as usual, top notch as menacing heavy. Beautifully photographed. It's too bad Brando didn't direct a few more films.
B00005JKC3|1.0|I usually don't like to write a bad review but I didn't want anyone else to waste their money buying this dvd.  It was PAINFUL to say the least!  My husband had taken our sons to see it at the theatre and had warned me that it was horrible but I wanted to see for myself.  There are no words to accurately describe how bad this movie was.  I couldn't even make it through the whole thing!  My son skiped to the &quot;good&quot; parts which were equally as dreadful!  I felt like literally throwing it in the trash afterwards as I was so disgusted that my brother and sister-in-law had spent their hard earned money on buying this for my sons(they had not seen it themselves or they would not have bought it).  PLEASE don't waste your time in watching this.  I cannot believe that Jennifer Connelly (an Academy-Award-winning actress none-the-less)would agree to star in this movie which was so awful!  Shame, shame!!!  I can only imagine her disappointed and embarrassment as she watched it for the first time at the screening.  Maybe from now on she will take a closer look and be more picky about the roles she takes on.  I would give the a grade of F-
0767827902|3.0|This flick is overrated. But you've got to give the filmmakers credit for going with black- and- white, for shooting it in Texas (where the story takes place) and for not trying to squeeze in too many characters into the &quot;plot.&quot;<BR>The Chase, starring Marlon Brando, that also takes place in Texas, might have received all the praise heaped on the Last Picture Show flick had they gone the black -and- white route and stayed away from the Universal back lot. <br />Hud, also shot in Texas, was a better film than this. It seems to me, a good rule of thumb to doing pictures in Texas is to go with black-and-white photography. Don't know why, could be the automatic,  built-in authenticity factor one gets with B &amp; W. Color very often means Hollywood glitz, and doesn't seem to work well with this type of tale.<br />Anyway, it's not the worst flick ever made. Ben Johnson does a nice job, so does Ellen Burstyn. The latter two deserve four stars for their work here. Sybil Shephard was drop-dead gorgeous at the time.
B0001MDP3G|4.0|I read the book before I saw the movie, and I couldn't help but compare and contrast between the novel by Charles Frazier, and the movie adaptation. I found that the movie followed the same main plot and details of the novel, but that some aspects were changed to adhere more to today's movie-goers' tastes. I'm not sure if I recall correctly, but Im pretty sure that in the novel, the member of Teague's party that killed Inman was depicted as a very aprehensive, young man - in the movie, however, he was depicted as the most evil man you could ever imagine... some albino guy with with pale white skin, ice-cold eyes and some limited facial hair, and having played a significant role in the torture of a woman... Also, I recall that this man killed Inman without harm to himself - in the movie he is killed along with inman... anyways, good movie.
B0000DD7LB|2.0|Tracks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12 and 13... great...<br />The songs that I left out, 7,8 and 11 -- stupid, pointless, grotesque and nasty.<br />bad example for young teens. teaches about promiscuity and improper sexual acts with oneself. if people had been made to do that there would only be one person in the world because one person cannot reproduce without the help of a mate of the opposite sex.
B000002BYD|5.0|Been years since I purchased this. Brilliant album art.<br />I wasnt really big on &quot;Brain of J&quot; until recently after completing a few hundred listens of Yield.&quot;Faithfull&quot;starts and you hear the most beautiful discreet sound of guitarring And then Eddie's mindblowing lyrics &quot;Plaque on the wall says that no one's slept here/t's rare to come upon a bridge that has not been around/Or Been Stepped On...&quot; What follows is a brilliant power punch of a song that really brings delight and joy to me.<br />&quot;No Way&quot; is brutally addictive with its lyrics for an insatiable desire for a love one wants. &quot;Given to fly&quot; tests you.....its out there. &quot;Wishlist&quot; was my favourite track on the disc for the first few dozen times. &quot;Do The Evolution&quot; is something that shocked me. Its amazing how this band can be so unpredictable.<br />Then follows the last few tracks....which are truly the best. &quot;In Hiding&quot; reminds you of the times in your life when you're alone and maybe still are. It truly speaks to my soul and has this amazing ability to leave me expressionless totally overwhelmed. The last track on the disc &quot;All Those Yesterdays&quot; is certainly something the album needed to make it a truly unforgettable experience. Its the perfect full stop. The vibe around the song just raptures me into emotional shockwaves , the kind that words seldom express. Pearl Jam have been my favourite band for a while now and this just might be an album which is not bound by time. It holds its own. It will last forever. Pearl Jam will last forever.
B0000DD7LB|3.0|Ok, \\"A Music Fan From The United States\\"... $LOL$ you should stop trying to block the bad reviews because... because of how bad this album is it will keep getting bad reviews. Britney ~thinks~ that her singing about sex graphically is going to make her more mature and \\"attract a mature audience\\"? She couldn't be more wrong. She's not attracting young adults, she's pushing them away! What made me take these two stars off? \\"Outrageous\\" and \\"Touch Of My Hand\\"... Brit, no one needs to know how outrageous your sex drive is or how you feel when you *love yourself* LOL!!! Do it in the privacy of your home all that you want, but for God's sakes, DONT SING ABOUT IT! It will only make your IMAGE more DEPLORABLE.<br />Music fan... bad move. If you want to idolize such a bad example, go ahead.
B00004T8RK|4.0|Now first of all , I dont understand why people dislike this album. It has some of the best and arguably the best song Pearl Jam have done. I'm not big on Jam sessions so it took me some time to stomach the change. Track 4 &quot;Light Years&quot; is truly the most significant song Pearl Jam have done. It changed my outlook on a whole lot of matters in life. Its sad that music like this is just not made nowadays.<br />&quot;Light Years&quot; is the sort of song that I can listen to every day of my life and look back and cherish the pain and pleasure of it all. &quot;Nothing As It Seems&quot; is good if not great. Its defenitely a great song to listen to when Light Years ends.<br />&quot;Thin Air&quot; Now how can I possibly describe this? I mean its just the most perfect song you can sing to your girl. It just mellows into an absolutely rock solid performance by the band. Romantic indeed even if your not a beleiver! &quot;Parting Ways&quot; is another wonder of a track. &quot;Insignificance&quot; is just as calm as anything PJ have done. I salute Vedder for the effects his vocals has on the listener. Typing is ah well, nevermind.<br />If your a true Pearl Jan like I am and if you think there are no limits to excellence purchase this album.
B00005JMCN|3.0|Boring, but watchable sentimental crap.<br /><br />If you've ever read an inspirational story in a women's magazine you've seen  this.  If you've ever seen a sports movie, this is exactly average.... definitely not transcendental, but at least it's coherent.<br /><br />I like Jeff Bridges, but he seems to be one of those good actors who always choose the wrong roles... check out Tideland or Big Lebowski instead.
B0002858YS|5.0|So i know what your thinking. Im gonna buy this CD, and the only good song will be somebody told me, and im half sick of that from being all over MTV. Well... the other songs are fan fricken tastic also. I honestly don't skip any of the songs. I do have my favorites though. Track 1 AMAZING. 10/10. Track 3,4,5,6 i give a 9.5/10 Track 7 10/10  track 8 10/10. Track 9 9/10 Track 10 so good. This CD will be in your stereo for a week, at least. Go pick it up while its new and on sale everywhere. Cause you'll end up buying it anyways. Its just to catchy to resist.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|I saw this movie when it came out on theatres and I was amazed of how good it was. But the worst thing about it is that the trailer didn't go with the movie. I bought the DVD and I really like the Director's Cut.
B000089RVX|5.0|Don't listen to the last review. Evanescence is not another Avril Lavigne. Amy Lee's vocals are dramatic, and the rest of the crew are 100% talent. The lyrics that Amy Lee writes are meaningful and sometimes gothic. This band uses no foul language in their songs and is clearly anti-violent. <BR>Evanescence puts an uplifting turn onto the goth community and shows that gothic does not equal evil. The songs are from their hearts and they do not over-hype themselves. They go onstage as themselves, not as Hollywood pretenders. Some bands try to imitate them, but they cannot succeed. Evanescence has its own flavor that no one can duplicate. Some of my favorite songs on the album:<BR>11.Whisper<BR>1.Going Under<BR>5.Haunted<BR>4.My Immortal<BR>9.Hello<BR>I love them all, but these are my favorites. So just give it a chance and listen to a couple of the songs listed above. If you still aren't convinced, listen to ALL the songs- full length! :-)
B000001DYD|5.0|Having seen PJ perform Rid Of Me live in Athens just a month ago, alone on stage with her guitar, having heard her desperate wailings, her calling to that great unknown, it is hard to be unbiased. Her soul is in every song she has ever written. And she gives nothing less than her soul in her performances. This album is a great introduction to her universe, a world where wounded and healers drink together. She is definitely one of the greatest women singers-songwriters of our time, giving blues a whole different meaning. Missed is also an amazing track, full of bitterness and awareness of the unavoidable.<br />Definitely a must-have for anyone interested in a great voice accompanied by great passion and soul.<br />Thank you PJ.
B00006RINF|4.0|I was listening to the sample music and was amazed by the woman's voice. I like their style, which reminds me of Evanescence, which is my favorite band. I think if I hear the full song of Daylight Dancer I will buy it. The only thing I didn't like was the repetitive chords.
B0001611DI|5.0|People who cannot see the genius of this movie have no imagination whatsoever. The plot and overall story by George A. Romero is superb, and indeed frightening despite some of the campy special effects. <br />If you see the movie in the context of events, taking into account the monumental distaster that is out of control, it's truly horrific. The fact that Romero doesn't offer a concrete reason why the dead return to life, captures a strong sense of desperation for the living as they are being eliminated as a race. They don't know what's causing it so they have no way of knowing how to stop it- aside from the idea of nuking the big cities. <br />Our four heroes did make a few dumb mistakes. But Romero's point was to capture the realism of what happens when fear and/or ego overtakes them- they panicked and did things that were downright stupid. A very human thing to do.   <br />The movie is a chaotic masterpiece. The story of Peter, Roger, Steve and Fran is that of disaster, desperation and ultimately, TRAGEDY. They struggle with their lives for survival and after a while, to have some sense of normalcy while holing up in the shopping mall for months. Romero's captures it beautifully as the calm before the storm, which ends horribly for the four. <br />Nevertheless it was comforting to see Fran and Peter fly off into the uncertain future, offering a faint ray of hope for them.<BR>Great job George! This movie is still a horror-shock classic for all time!
B00005JMCW|4.0|This movie was funny, sad, and interesting all at the same time.  It could touch so many audiences.  It really explored the mother-daughter relationship, which so many women have a problem with.  It was a sweet movie, and I really liked it.  The mother and the daughter, no matter how different they were, ended up loving each other.
B00005AQE8|5.0|This is an awesome album! &quot;All About U&quot; is one of the most awesome songs I have heard in my entire life. Snoop Dogg, Nate Dogg, KC &amp; Jo-Jo, and many more artist's voices can be heard on this album. 2Pac was, and is always going to be one of the greatest.
B0001Z53AQ|5.0|here's an overview of tha tracks:<BR>1. Git up: tight intro... fast paced: 4/5<BR>2. Loyalty: longass song, but tight verses: 4/5<BR>3.

B0001ZX0PG|5.0|Let me start by saying that every one hats the ending to this film. I won't spoil it, but it's pretty bad. Anyway, the movie is about to cops looking for the killer of thier best friend daughter. The film is good and should have won best film of the year instead of Lord of the Rings 3, which was stuip. All the acting is great.
B00003CXCT|5.0|im so tiered of people slaming the return of the jedi i of course am refering to the origianl not the special edition piece of crap! jedi and empire are the best and these new lucas jokes called episode 1 and 2 are the real problems! buy this dvd!!!!!buy it!!
B00007M5CO|2.0|Seems like these guys really like British techno, the problem is that the &quot;electronica&quot; part of this record sounds dated. It seems like the money they should've spent on good equipment was spent on marketing. On top of that, the tango samples lost their depth and seem flat and one-dimensional. Buy Gotan instead, or even better, buy Narcotango by Carlos Libedinsky!

6304936303|4.0|Tony Scott's THE LAST BOY SCOUT may be trash, but for an action flick it is very well-made, highly entertaining trash. <br />Of course, you could make a very good case against this film. Though I did not find it quite as woman-hating as some of the critics said it was upon the film's release, I would recognize that there is a subtle layer of misogyny throughout the movie---particularly with the two women characters in Joe Hallenbeck's life, his uncaring, cheating wife and his bratty, verbally abusive daughter---that might make some viewers more queasy than I was. And, objectively speaking, THE LAST BOY SCOUT is basically a retread of writer Shane Black's superior LETHAL WEAPON---a more foul-mouthed, ultra-violent retread with a lot of corny humor. This is an all-out testosterone-fest if I've ever seen one. If you've got a problem with people, just punch 'em in the &quot;head or gut&quot;---if anything else, that's the message of this movie. Really, Shane Black, where did your taste go since LETHAL WEAPON and LETHAL WEAPON 2?<br />Despite all that, though, this movie still delivers what matters most in this genre: thrills and exciting action scenes. Having seen this movie only recently, I must say that it is probably one of the most exciting action pictures I've seen in a long while, perhaps enjoyable because of its excesses. Tony Scott definitely knows how to film action scenes well (the climactic action scenes in the football stadium is a good example of his skill here), and of course he brings his customary slick style to the material. And its plot, involving a ruthless attempt to legalize gambling in pro football, takes some kinda intriguing twists and turns along the way. (It's like a hardcore action-film version of one of those hardboiled detective films of the '40s.) <br />In short, THE LAST BOY SCOUT is very trashy but still entertaining action movie that can be quite fun to watch, depending on whether you can overlook lapses of character logic (why on Earthis Shelly Marcone giving away his plan of framing Hallenbeck for Senator Baynad's murder just so Hallenbeck can outsmart 'em all?) as well as the more objectionable misogynistic aspects of the film. Personally, I felt a little guilty about enjoying it so much...but not guilty enough not to admit it. Marginally recommended.
0679601686|5.0|I was truly surprised by this tale. I was drawn from the very first page by Mrs. Bennets gossip. What was equally delightful was the sarcastic manner in which Mr. Bennet responded to her chatter, and she was none the wiser. And so begins a tale of wit that engages the minds.<br />From the moment Darcy is mentioned, with his ill manners, we know that he will be key to the story and surely he is. The engaging repetoire between Elizabeth and Darcy is what makes the novel such an interesting read. From their haughty demeanor to falling in love, this tale is rich with engaging conversations.<br />This novel gives an enlightening aspect to the 'higher' society of British life. There is a wicked vein that runs throughout the book, for the outlook on such a life seems quite vain if not ridiculous. Miss Austen does an excellent job of conveying that life to us, with enough wit and sarcasm.<br />I enjoyed this book immensely and would recommend it to anyone wanting a witty read.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|My son and I rented this movie and first watched the theatrical release and we loved it -to the point at 3:00am we started watching certain parts with the commentary and the deleted scenes. The alternate ending was beautiful and my 14 year old son and I debated which ending was better and the always interesting time line. We are getting ready to watch the directors cut to see if a new mystery pops up. No matter what version or ending you prefer it really gets you thinking about your life!

B00005YXZH|5.0|Like most listeners, it took me several listens before I could even really tolerate many of the songs on YHF.  Now I consider it brilliant and truly beautiful.  I assure anyone concerned that people only like this album because it's different that my love for the album is genuine.  Two years later and the songs still seem to connect more with each listen.  The lyrics are sometimes cryptic but make more sense over time and have a distinctive flavor.  The song-writing is not really as groundbreaking as some might proclaim, but the production of the songs is brilliant.  Although the songwriting certainly comes from a different angle, I can't avoid the comparison to Pink Floyd with the incorporation of extraneous soundeffects into the flow of the songs.  Ashes of American Flags is particularly brilliant in this regard, with two stunning but simple guitar parts cutting through out of the swirling static.  The result of the production is that even lines of music that essentially amount to pop gain an otherworldly glow;  Pot Kettle Black is another great example of this, as is I Am Trying to Break Your Heart.  I would also be doing an injustice if I didn't mention how much I love I'm The Man Who Loves You, with its swelling conclusion.  This is a collection of songs that would be good without the magical glow of the brilliant production, but which gains a unique appeal in its combination of swirling dissonances and common sense melodies.  Buy this album!  There's a decent chance you won't like it, but it will become a cherished possession if you do; it occupies a completely unique space in music and will move you more with each listen.
B0001Z52RU|3.0|I loved this movie except for Ashton.  He was too goofy and laid back during serious scenes.  It reminded me of Donnie Darko a lot, but there was much better acting in that film.  And, the story was better.  Just watch Donnie Darko.
B0000AFX64|5.0|I don't care what version of Battlestar Galactice folks like. I like this one, but that's just my view. Like what ya want BUT make sure you put the right review with the right DVD. It's important to know that this DVD is the theatrical version of the 70's Battlestar NOT the 2003 Ron Moore version. There are negative reviews of the 2003 version on here, but this is not that version. Be sure to put the right review with the right DVD.
B0001611DI|4.0|Going into this movie, I had high hopes, and all in all it filled them. I ended up watching the first half with some friends, who are not ones who usually would pick this type of movie. As you would have guessed, they didn't take to the film to well and we ended up stopping it after the white army dude stabbed a zombie in the ear and the bright pink blood poured out. They said it was to fake. We did get a share of laughs out of it though. For example when they are raiding the apartment building and the fat guy busts down a door and shoots one of the occupants causing his head to explode. Good stuff! <br />I myself believe the introduction that uses the television station could have been cut a little shorter, but hey I can't change it so Ill just fast forward. <br />The gore effects in this movie are extreme for its time. The biting and the shooting is all the gore you get until you get into the meat of the film. The best gore through out the film has got to be the part where the zombies tear the stomachs open of a couple of the bikers, intense. They actually show the intestines spilling out and the bikers faces as they scream in agony. <BR> <BR>By not stating what I thought was funny, I'll just allow the viewer to pick out his or her own comedic parts with in the movie. Believe me, you will find at the very least one part in this film funny. If not a laugh out loud then a slight chuckle.<br />If I may I would like to say to J. from Montclair that did the review that is one star and long, dude you are reading way to into this man. This is not totally a serious horror movie. Your dissecting it from every angle possible, you can't do that with this movie or it will suck. Once again, it's not totally serious.<BR> <BR>Well this DVD has some nice extras like posters, radio and TV spots, trailers, different sound settings, and more. It's worth it if you are a horror/gore movie fan.
0064471837|5.0|Sabriel is a book that I could not put down. All it took to buy it was a recommendation on the back cover from author Lloyd Alexander, and it was in the shopping cart. When I started to read, I did not want to stop. Sabriel is immediately faced with finding out if her beloved father is dead or not. He is the Abhorsen, the one who can travel into the realm of the dead, passing through several gates, to accomplish certain tasks. He uses different size bells (thus the bells on the cover of the book) to accomplish these tasks. If he is dead, Sabriel is the new Abhorsen, and she does not feel ready in any way to take on that role. But her father sent a messenger to her, from the far gates of the dead, where he was either trapped or truly dead, to leave her his bells and his sword. Off Sabriel must go, from her school in Ancelstierre (no magic) to her father's home in the Old Kingdom (magic does work, and people do and have magic powers). There she finds an amazing cat-like creature named Mogget who plays an important role. But you are never sure if Mogget is good or if he is bad. There is also a Prince who has to be awakened. Mogget suggets Sabriel awaken him with a kiss, but Sabriel gently breathes on his lips instead. Mogget calls him Touchstone for a reason that has to do with why he has been asleep for two hundred years. Sabriel, Touchstone, and Mogget set off to try and save her father, the Old Kingdom, and to stop the evil from spreading and invading Ancelstierre. While  trying to accomplish all of these things, Sabriel \\"grows up\\" emotionally and learns the final lessons that her father would have her learn. Garth Nix has woven a marvelous fantasy in this book. It is on the darker side, but I found it full of characters that seemed so real, and so alive to me. This is fantasy at its best! I look forward to the other two books in this world, I can't WAIT to read them. Thank you so much Mr. Nix! DreamReaderandHopfulWriter
B00005MAM2|4.0|This is one of the best anime films i've ever seen. The animation is good. Even in the original film the animation is great for a 1988 movie. It is violent and has plenty of language. The dubbing was horrible, not the voice acting but how the characters mouths moved with the words (for those of you who really care about that sort of thing.) I actually liked the voices. If you've ever seen the series Trigun or Dual Parallel - Trouble - Adventure you will probably recognize the voice talents of Johnny Yong Bosch (sp?) who was Vash in Trigun and the dude who played Kasuke in Dual. The story is also pretty cool. The only really downside to the movie (for some people only) is that the movie seems to go on for a really long time. I kept thinking it was about to end and then something else would begin and that got kinda annoying. Overall I really enjoyed this movie and would definately reccomend it  especially for fans of the Armitage movies.
B00019PDKC|5.0|I've been searching for some new music to play because I'm a classic rock man and I stumbled upon Anathema, and holy cow, this album is soo melodic and even rocks.  Now I'm hooked on Anathema's latest 4 albums, I'm not a fan of their Death Metal days, which pretty muched sucked, yep, their first albums sucked.  Now they just rock and the songs are actually catchy.  Each song is just amazing, especially the first half of the album.  Add this one to your collection, and look forward to more Anathema releases, they have potential to be classic.
B0000542D2|1.0|First and foremost, A Hard Day's Night is a great film starring the greatest band in the history of music.  The Miramax DVD of this classic film is one of the worst DVDs of alltime.  The 5.1 soundtrack mix is awful and the attempted letterboxing is equally as bad since the film was not shot in widescreen.  If you can get your hands on the first AHDN DVD, issued in 1997 by MPI, grab it at any cost.  The MPI DVD was produced after the film was restored and had its premiere on the American Movie Classics (AMC)cable channel. It is not in 5.1 digital sound, but it's a heck-of-a-lot better than the mix Miramax came up with.  Don't let my rating of 1 star fool you, however.  The Miramax AHDN DVD gets 1 star, A Hard Day's Night, THE MOVIE, gets a 5 star (or better) rating in my opinion.  ST
B00000AFWW|4.0|I think that this CD was a total transformation from &quot;Live Through This&quot;...not as good. The standout tracks are:<br />CELEBRITY SKIN, wich is a good rock song...<br />AWFUL, which the lyrics are from a old negro praise song, I know scary...<br />HIT SO HARD, lyrics kinda imply that she killed Kurt, I dunno...<br />MALIBU, good peaceful rock song...<br />REASONS TO BE BEAUTIFUL is a grungy type song...<br />DYING is a nice slow ballad...<br />NORTHERN STAR is Courtney getting in touch with her Indian roots :-) ...<br />PLAYING YOUR SONG, my favorite song on the album...<br />So, yeah its a pretty good CD....
B00005A0N5|5.0|Good CD here is a better review<br />1. Stargazers: Good opener very power metal. 5/5<br />2. Gethsemane: This is another good song. It is like speed metal and power metal put together. 5/5<BR>  <BR>3. Devil &amp; The Deep Dark Ocean: This is not the first time Nightwish has used a male voice in there songs. I like it but I would not say it is the best use of a male voice. You can find a better use of it on CC and Once. But Tarja is really good here. 5/5  <br />4. Sacrament Of Wilderness: This song has a good opening and it stays that way for the whole song. It is fast and heavy and good. 5/5<BR>  <BR>5. Passion And The Opera: A good song but not great. 3/5<BR>  <BR>6. Swanheart: A great song starts slow then gets heavy. But not to heavy. 5/5<BR>      <BR>7. Moondance: No singing but I still like it. 4/5<BR>      <BR>8. The Riddler: I like this song for the fact that it seems to lead into the next song. 5/5<BR>      <BR>9. The Pharaoh Sails To Orion: Again the male voice is not the best here. Tajra on the other hand is very good here. 4/5<BR>      <BR>10. Walking in the Air: This was not writen by Nightwish. But I like what they have done with it. It starts slow then gets heavy and faster. 5/5<BR>      <BR>11. Sleeping Sun: Not the best song on the CD. It is ok. 3/5<br />This is not a goth band they are a power/speed/opera. Just because they have a female sing it does not make them goth.
B0001IN0DA|4.0|This was certainly not the best PPV ever or even the best Wrestlemania ever.  Hell, I liked 19 better.      Cena/Show- I'm sorry but borrrrrring match dominated by Show.  The only good part was the ending. 3/10    Tag Title Fatal 4 Way- Just average 6/10    Christian/Jericho- Pretty damn good match, the event picks up here. 8/10    Evolution vs. Rock and Sock- Another damn good match. 8/10    Playboy evening gown is fun if you like nice asses.    Didn't see the cruiserweight open, heard it was just decent.    Lesnar/Goldberg- Well let's see they stall for a few MINUTES, grapple, push eachother away, and stall for about five more minutes.  Terrible, TERRIBLE, HORRIBLE, AWFUL match.  Possibly the worst match in wrestlemania history.  I didnt expect much from this match, but I expected better than what I saw.  Skip this match, it's just indescribably painful to watch.  0/10    Smackdown Tag title fatal 4 way- 6/10    Women's title match- good women's match 7/10    Angle/Eddy G.- Very good match as one could expect from this duo 8.5/10    Taker/Kane- I actually really enjoyed the actual match.  Granted, taker's attire still lacked the precise oldschool/deadman look, it was neat to see deadman taker again and the match itself was surprisingly good. 8.5/10    Michaels/HHH/Benoit for the Raw title- AWESOME.  I don't know if I'd call it the single greatest WM match ever but certainly one of the best.  Just everything you'd expect from a great match. 10/10

B0001Z52RU|5.0|I bought this dvd on it's release date.  Alot of people including my friends told me that this movie was really good.  I'm glad I took ther advice and bought this movie.  If you like Ashton Kutcher or if you want to see a great movie buy this movie now.
0142004235|5.0|i've been trying to figure out why i liked this book so much. i was expecting to find it long and dull. <br />When the first chapter was entirely narration, without a single peice of dialouge or plot, i almost put the book down then and there (actually, there isnt any dialouge until the bottom of page 24). However, i actually found myself enjoying even the long discriptions of scenery that i usually skim or skip entirely. <br />The plot was fast, but somehow the book kept the feeling that it was slowly plodding along. It almost has the feeling of reading a history textbook. for some reason, however, i was completely intrigued, and had trouble putting it down for long.<br />Actually, to talk about the book's \\"plot\\" is a bit of a stretch, because the focus of the book is entirely off of action. Many key events happen \\"offstage\\" (to use theater terms), and some are only implied. Steinbeck focuses on motivations, and the characters thoughts and emotions, rather than the actions themselves.<br />everything i usually i love about a novel, this novel didnt have, and this novel had alot i usually hate in a novel, and yet i still found myself enjoying it immensely. i guess thats y its a classic.
1400034779|5.0|At first, I was not sure if I would like this story but I ended up loving it.  It was a very easy read and I fell in love with the character of Mme Ramotswe.  This detective story has alot of heart and there is really good advice in it also.  I recommend this book to anyone looking for a light hearted, good read.
0671027344|5.0|If you do not find the character of Charlie to be believable, it isn't because he doesn't exist out there. It's because you never lived it. Some of us have. And for those of us who understand, it is a beautiful story.
B0001WTUH6|3.0|When I saw the movie poster a couple weeks before Underworld came out I knew I would like it, but I never had the opportunity to see it in theaters.  Instead I had to wait to see it on video at a party and it was everything I had expected it to be, soaked in atmosphere and loud.  Action packed?  Yes.  Romantic? No.  Don't expect it to be a retelling of Romeo and Juliet, although the general elements are there.<br />As the movie opens we are told that Vampires and Werewolves have been at war with each other for 'the better part of a thousand years.'  And to illustrate that point the Vampires and Werewolves battle out in a subway station for the first twenty or so minutes.  The only surviving Vampire from this encounter, Selene, discovers a den of werewolves hidden beneath the city. and with that discovery she also uncovers a conspiracy between the vampire leader, Kraven, and the werewolf leader, Lucian, that involves a human named Michael, who is due to show his true nature at the next full moon. Fearing that Kraven's actions may place the vampires in jeopardy, Selene does the unthinkable - bypassing protocol, she awakens the ancient vampire noble, Viktor, from a mummified coma, so he can stop Kraven. <br />The strengths of the movie lie in its visuals.  The costumes, the sets, the action, they all rock.  Since the action sequences take place in the first and last quarters these are the most involving parts of the movie.  When the action transpires through dialogue the movie slows down, although what is left of the visuals definitely keeps the movie interesting to watch.  The acting is virtually non-existant.  Everyone is playing types so it isn't hard to pull off.  The only one who is annoying to watch is Kraven, who twists his face a few times too often.  Kate Beckinsale will probably find more than one fan with her appearance in 'the body condom.'  As for the chemistry between the characters?  Well, like I said, its not a romance, but they still manage to fit in akiss that makes absolutely no sense.<br />Well, some people like me will be obsessed with the movie, trying to suck every detail out of everything.  As a work of art it isn't a masterpiece but it is definitely entertaining.
0141301066|3.0|Roald Dahl wrote a book about a girl called Matilda.<BR>Matilda is a genius, but no one supports her.<BR>In school she and all the other children are frighten about the brutal headmistress Miss Trunchbull.<BR>Miss Trunchbull hates children an terrorises them.<BR>But Matilda is taking the battle against her...<br />Roald Dahl's book is a typical story for children, because the charakters of the people in it are fitting perfectly into their rolls.

B000002UA2|5.0|I wanna make this short and sweet but its is too good to do that. This album is so great. If you have any interest in Pink Floyd Get this album. No one really thinks of this album and it is very underrated.<BR>1.Obscured By Clouds- instrumental but very good<BR>2.When You're In - instrumental, and a good one again<BR>3. Burning Bridges - sounds like something from dark side of the moon, good song<BR>4. The Gold It's In The... - If you want a faster song by pink floyd this is the one. My 2nd fav song on on album<BR>5. Wots...Uh The Deal - MY favorite song ,the lyrics to this are so amazing,this track is some of Pink Floyds best work.<BR>6. Mudmen -instrumental, very cool<BR>7. Childhood's End - this is another track thats sounds like it's from dark side of the moon.<BR>8. Free Four - this is 3rd favorite song, really good song, good lyrics<BR>9. Stay  - a good song       <BR>10. Absolutely Curtains  - this song i dont care for much but the other tracks make out for it<BR>Must buy<BR>5 stars. <BR>classic
B0002858YS|5.0|I first heard the song 'Somebody Told Me' as the number one song on 92.3 K-Rock Furious 5 at 5. (for those of you out of town its a countdown on NYC's alternative rock station.)Once I heard the name of ther artist I sampled more tracks. I was floored and bought it the next day. It is amazing to see a new group that could easily go the way of all the coprate rock bands and instead go the way of 80's new wave. The use of synthesizer and style of vocals really brings back the names 'Tears For Fears', 'The Cure' and 'New Order'. This is perhaps the begining of a revinvention of a sound that has been lost for over 20 years. It is a sound almost everyone loves and doesn't want to forget and yes we even want it back. Even if The Killers never make another album and vanish off the face of the Earth I will say this...your attempt was bold and will be remembered for a job well done.
B000002UAO|2.0|As the previous reviewer has noted, these oldies primarily have nostalgic appeal to people who were around at the time of its release.  After 40 years, newer listeners will find that Rubber Soul sounds hopelessly dated, as would be expected.
B00025ETIW|5.0|I'm a pretty picky person when it comes to music. I truly enjoy only a handful of bands, and My Chemical Romance has been in my top 3 for a while. I pre-ordered an autographed copy of this cd before it even came out, so even if it sucked I'd probably like it. Anyways, it's completely amazing, just like i knew it would be. I think it would appeal to more people than the first album &quot;I brought you my bullets, you brought me your love&quot;, but i don't really see it in a 'sell-out' way. I guess it feels like the general demeanor is not quite as dark and brooding as the previous album. <br />Track 1 (Helena) is absolutely amazing. The first time i heard it, it reassured me that the album would be just as awesome as the first. 15/10<br />Track 2 (Give em hell, kid) I personally  feel like it's a step down from Helena, but still pretty good. 9/10<br />Track 3 (To the end) is another one of my favorites, even though it probably wouldn't appeal to a ton of people. 10/10 <br />Track 4 (you know what they do to guys like us in prison) isn't one of my favorites, but it's just awesome because Bert McCracken (of The Used) does some of the screaming and whatnot and almost anything he does amazes me. 9/10<br />Track 5 (I'm not okay)is the single, not really a song that stands out to me, but it's pretty easy to enjoy. 8/10<br />Track 6 (The Ghost of You) completely blows me away, it's much softer than most of the cd but it's a beautiful and emotional song. 10/10<br />Track 7 (The jetset life is going to kill you) is yet another great song, it's louder and faster than the previous song. 9/10<br />Track 8 (interlude) isn't what I expected, it's much better. Quiet music and Gerard singing very softly, it sounds really beautiful. 9/10<br />Track 9 (Thank you for the venom) is the 3rd song I previed off of this cd, and WOW. It's amazing. Back to being loud and fast, more punk-feeling than most of the cd. 10/10<br />Track 10 (Hang em high) is another one I enjoy quite a bit, it starts out kind of country-sounding and then breaks out into erratic, loud, obnoxious music. One of the only songs that Gerard screams on. 11/10<br />Track 11 (it's not a fashion statement, it's a deathwish) isn't one of my favorites, but I could understand it appealing to other people. 9/10<br />Track 12 (Cemetary Drive) is tied with track 1 for my personal favorite. Quite a bit softer than the majority of the cd, but with beautiful vocals and awesome lyrics. It's amazing. 15/10<br />Track 13 (I never told you what I do for a living) isn't one of my favorites, but it's actually a pretty good song. 9/10<br />Overall an awesome cd, ever since it was delivered to my house on the day it was released (June 8, 2004) it hasn't left my cd player. I'd recommend it to anyone.
B00005JLR8|3.0|\\"In America,\\" is a wonderful movie with a beautiful story.  The experience of a family as seen from the eyes of their daughter.  The death of a child and the struggles of starting over in a new country.  This film does have ONE explicit sex part which could have been more tastefully done so the film could be called,\\"family friendly,\\"  but this one scene does some measurable damage to the overall viewing audiences resulting in a beautiful and inspiring story LOST to young and adolescent viewing ages that could find alot of good from the story message.<BR>I hope producers and directors will soon get the message that even though your film may be a good one and wonderful acting such as this one, a clean, meaninful story will go farther and be accepted in more audiences than cheaping a good film with scenes unacceptable to ALL audiences. The expression of sexuality between couples is a beautiful and an individually private expression and attempts to produce this on screen results in \\"cheaping the expression,\\" as evidenced in this movie.<BR> This film would have received a 5 star from me had the necessary people utilized better judgment and more creativity in the \\"conception scene.\\"
B00006RCNJ|4.0|I had previously seen and purchased the Live in Dublin DVD, and was looking to expand my &quot;collection&quot;.  Some of the comments posted here made me think twice about this selection, especially regarding the video quality.<br />Eventhough the video is not the best, I found the program to be excellent, and in fact watched it 3 times when I first got it!  The poor video quality and constant angle changes mentioned by other reviewers was not really a detriment in my opinion, because the program is otherwise very enjoyable.  The extended encores are especially enjoyable, where the orchestra diverts from classical music to popular songs from around the globe, and has the crowd literally dancing in the aisles.<br />The track listing on the Amazon.com website is definitely incorrect, so look elsewhere to find out the contents.  However, my bottom line is DON'T pass up this DVD because of the minor negative comments, because they're not that big of a deal, and the program is so fun and rewarding to watch, over and over.
B0001RVTXO|2.0|Does noone else's copy of this cd have a very present static throughout the entire song \\"Bone Machine\\"?  I returned my first copy and the replacement has the same problem.  The rest of the cd is great!
B000002UA5|5.0|I was introduced to Pink Floyd one lazy Saturday afternoon during a welcome home party for a friend who had just returned from a long vacation in California. He brought some rather interesting things back to our little town in south eastern Pennsylvania, some of which was music. There was one of those old small record players that folded up into a box, sitting in the middle of the room on the floor. Everybody was mulling around not paying particular attention to the music. Then someone put a new LP on the player and walked away. The first sounds off that record stopped me in my tracks! I had never heard anything like that in my life. I sat down in the middle of the floor and listened to the whole studio record. Then I asked our friend \\"who is that playing?\\" Of course he said Pink Floyd. The album was Ummagumma.     One month later in Philadelphia, I watched Pink Floyd perform, (as we sat on sawdust, on the floor of the Electric Factory) the entire live side of Ummagumma, they then took a break whilst another band did a set, then the Floyd did a second set that was the incredible on-stage performance of the studio record! To this day, I've never seen anything like that. Price of admission $6.50 each! (those were the days). The Floyd were virtually unknowns in the States at that time. That was the Fall of 1969.    I've been a Floyd fan ever since then. I've never missed any of their concert tours either. I've even met the band.     Therefore, the point of my review is this: Ummagumma was not just some junk that the band put together in the studio, it was in fact, an experiment in music that most people weren't ready for in 1969. Listening to it on the record was intriguing to say the least, seeing it performed live on stage was (in the words of those days) Mind Blowing. It's not an album to dance to or even to sing along with. It is, and was, an experiment in music like none ever done before. Sure I like all the Floyd music, \\"Wish You Were Here\\" is my favorite. But Ummagumma will always be special to me. Just writing about it brings back the excitement of the night they DID IT LIVE ONSTAGE!
B00006LLNU|5.0|This album reminds me of walking in the blistering cold in the snow. This Icelandic band creates soundscapes that are cold and sterile, yet can bring a tear to your eye.  The guitarist likes to use a bow, creating long notes in these slow ballads. Most songs start off soft and slowly build to a huge crescendo.  the first 4 tracks are more focused and accessible, the last four are noisier, and rely less on normal melodies.  The vocals are in hoplandic i.e. gibberish, but really it is the singer trying to use his voice as any other instrument. Just the sound and inflection are what are important. I think this is the band's best album to date, but all 3 are fantastic.
B000002IST|1.0|This cd is by far not the best one at all. Too many stupid pop songs to be even considered rock. Look at Yes, King Crimson, and Steve Hackett. They are still around, in full force, and enjoying fanfare while Genesis is gone. No, they didn't make that many hits but at least they are still around. Phil Collins is retiring, and Tony Banks quit the rock industry for classical music. What does this say? Progressive rock lives on while pop is short lived and was the ultimate end of Genesis; since, they went the wrong direction after Steve Hackett quit. How many other pop bands and solo artists from the 80's that have either gone back to rock or have disappeared completely? Genesis could have got new members for new ideas or changed the name but they didn't. Where were you identityless hypocritical phony Genesis fans supporting the band when Calling All Stations came out? Genesis lost their original fan base when they when pop, and overused machines to fill in the gaps when they should have had new members. They lost their phony so-called Genesis pop fans when Phil quit. Very sad way to go for a band that did such great albums like The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway, Selling England By the Pound, and A Trick of The Tail. Hits aren't  everything for a band as they shorten any band's life as proven here.
0385512104|2.0|Another example that what passes for good fiction these days is often just mediocre.<BR>    The story is not well constructed, the internal workings of the autistic child's brain were often not believable and, more often, uncompelling. He could have done something interesting with this setup, but it seems cheap, hurried, and actually unthoughtful, considering its ambitions.<BR>    And, really, in the end, it left with the feeling that it was just another cheap novel with more thought going into making it marketable than making it good.
B0000C7PQK|5.0|I haven't been one to really appreciate the words of others when<BR>they praise music because usually it's such a matter of personal<BR>taste but in this case I have to make a special exception. This<BR>is kick ass music that is just not able to be passed up! It<BR>screams for you to listen to it more. Even more so it is just<BR>this feeling of having no reason to listen but listening anyway,<BR>that enables us to feel what he is saying. This feeling requires<BR>no effort from the listener, just a few listens to get the gist<BR>of what Michel Cretu was trying to express. He does away with<BR>the sampling of the past CD's, this time settling for a<BR>beautiful arrangement of guitars and strange sounds you'll<BR>wonder about.
B0001GOH6Q|4.0|This is a story about a father who loves to tell tall tales.  When he nears the end of his life, his literalist journalist son, angry at what he considers to be his father's deception, tries to learn the truth about his father's life.  <br />The result is a magical blending of truth, fiction, reality and fantasy.  At points, I found the movie going too far out, but soon afterwards, it would reel the story back in.  Together with the actors, the viewer questions the boundary between fact and fiction and how important it really is to know the truth.<br />The father gives a moving performance.  I sometimes found the son to be unrealistically cold.  It was hard to reconcile his anger at his father with the fact that he gave up several weeks work to stay home once his father became ill.<br />Seemingly outlandish at places, the pieces fall together in the end, providing a satisfying conclusion.  A good movie overall, especially for fathers.
B000005GX7|5.0|This record has the whole package: masterful musicians in top form, original song selections and arrangements, scintillating interplay, and good sound quality. As with all late Joe Henderson, the playing overall gives the impression of sophistication and calm. But amidst all of this, there is a fiery, questioning, anguished, boundary-pushing musical connection and expression. Ron Carter is masterful, weaving moments of tension, lyricism, delicacy and dissonance into his baselines and solos. Al Foster is varyingly subtle, loud, obnoxious and seamless when the moments call for it. Joe Henderson overall summons the image of an old wise man, with much to say, but tastfully giving his students only choice anecdotes so as not to overwhelm them. (This seems to be the difference between early and late Joe, there is always inherent knowledge, but over the years he gained wisdom. He expressed his knowledge broodingly and loudly in the 60s; more recently he expressed it hushly and wisely.) He plays masterfully, always accessible but at the same time questioning and unexpected. This recording never loses its freshness and intelligence over repeated listenings. It is continuingly rewarding and a good buy.
6305428271|5.0|Definitely a must see movie. &quot;rage rage against the dying of the light&quot; WOW. Every black and latino person must see this movie and understand how the ghetto life is affecting us and adapt some skills to make it a better place. I absorbed the lessons in the movie.
B00008H2LB|1.0|First of all, I heard Hybrid theory and it was tolerable at first but then it became mundane and just terrible. I hate kids that call this stuff &quot;metal&quot; or &quot;rap&quot;. Its just crap if you ask me. If anyone needs a definition of metal I would recommend bands like Metallica (The greatest band of all time), Slayer, Pantera, Megadeth, Iced Earth, Dream Theater, and anything else besides this &quot;nu-metal&quot; stuff. Linkin Park is the biggest sellout band of all time. For Meteora how many videos did they release? See my point. They have no talent. Their guitar riffs cannot be distinguished from the bass and all the other crap. This is not talent at all. Oh well this is just my oppinion.
B000059TEP|4.0|whoopi apparently isnt as pretty as Halle but definitely she is aa phenomenal actress. The black society hasnt fully accepted her bcos she is fond of white guys. I believe it comes with the territory. Its a risk for anyone who wants to make it real big in the game. She added spice to the movie and made it really worth watching. Every person needs to go cop this DVD.
0790731479|5.0|Re-watching Beetlejuice more than a decade after it thrilled, frightened and enthralled me as a child makes me sad about Mr. Tim Burton's transformation into a Hollywood favorite semi-quirky remake-director (Planet Of The Apes, Sleepy Hollow) in recent years (Big Fish indeed signals a hopeful recovery - if only Charlie And The Chocolate Factory doesn't spoil it...!) At the young age of thirty, and in only his second full length feature, Burton created a cult favorite that is one for the ages. In this bizarre, off-beat script by Michael McDowell (who collaborated with him before on an episode of the `Alfred Hitchcock Presents' television series) he found the ideal vehicle for his unique and strange imagination - and indeed, Burton's unique vision is more apparent here than in any of his movies, The Nightmare Before Christmas being the happy exception. Though it's true that it's not as personal a creation as `Nightmare' or Edward Scissorhands, this is the movie that would place Burton on the map as a major director, and would earn him his breakthrough job - directing the first Batman feature film. It is on Beetlejuice that he would also start several long-time collaborations with actors who would work with him again in the future - Michael Keaton (Batman &amp; Batman Returns), Winona Ryder (Edward Scissorhands), Jeffrey Jones (Ed Wood, Sleepy Hollow), Glenn Shadix and Catherine O'Hara (both of whom did voiceovers for Nightmare Before Christmas).<br />So, again, while Beetlejuice isn't as deep and personal film as we would see in Nightmare Before Christmas, Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood or Big Fish, Beetlejuice is an incredibly imaginative and captivating film and is a perfect black comedy. Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin are both more than adequate, but Michael Keaton in the title part is of course the real star of the show - although in reality his part is much smaller than those of Davis and Baldwin. Keaton is electric and mesmerizing as the bio-exorcist or `the Ghost with the Most', Beetlejuice (spelled BETELGEUSE!), probably the greatest and most memorable performance of his career (with the possible exception of the part of Batman). Keaton really let loose in Beetlejuice, and he and Burton were seemingly having a blast - they created one of the most memorable horror and comedy characters on the big screen. Seventeen year old Winona is also terrific as Goth-girl Lydia, fascinated and repulsed by Betelgeuse's extreme personality. Similarities between her character here and the one in Edward Scissorhands are easy to find, but for my money her performance as Lydia is the better one.<br />And in conclusion, if there's any movie that I'd recommend to own on VCR or DVD, it's Beetlejuice; because Burton at his best made films that are well rewarding in repeated viewing, and Beetlejuice is Burton at his very, very best, even if it's not his best film. So even if it's not an essential masterpiece like Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice is one of the classic cult films of all time, and I can't imagine going through life without it - that is, if you have the tiniest bit of a sense of fun and humor.
B000000OQF|5.0|If there ever was an album that all future rock albums were judged on. this would be it. a must have for any guns n roses fan, or ne rock n roll lover. the music spewed out is a combination of slash's excellent guitar riffs, Axel roses deep and head banging vocals. my personal favorite cd of all time.
B00008PX8P|5.0|this DVD is worth the price for two songs alone: Since I've Been Loving You at Madison Square Garden and Going to California at Earl's Court. If you're already a Led Zeppelin fan like I am, you'll probably watch these two concerts over and over again.<br />As much as I love the Song Remains the Same, the sound quality from the MSG concert has been radically improved. And I believe  this version of Black Dog was a different night from the Song Remains the Same, as the entire band seems more lively and energetic. Misty Mountain Hop and the Ocean round out the incomparable MSG footage.<br />Earl's Court is the other concert featuring the Mighty Zeppelin at its prime. After opening with Going to California, we are treated to a mellow but beautiful That's the Way and a lively Bron Yr Aur Stomp before the absolutely epic In My Time Of Dying. Followed by an extremely rocking and up tempo Trampled Underfoot and classic Stairway rendition, Earl's Court is without a doubt the Crown Jewel of this DVD.<br />But in case your appetite for the best rock music of all time has not yet been satisfied, we have a 1979 Knebworth concert featuring some excellent later material. While the band is a bit past their prime, John Bonham steals the show with non-stop energy. Nobody's Fault but Mine is quite rollicking, and the live rendition of Kashmir is amazing to behold.<br />So, even without mentioning the first disk (I've never fully learned to appreciate 7 versions of Dazed and Confused, each clocking in at a minimum of 17 minutes...) the entertainment value provided here is second to none and an absolute must own.
B00005JMCW|4.0|I have to say I liked the book better. The movie is kind of shallow. I like Lindsay Lohan a lot, but for some reason this movie didn't serve a purpose for me. <BR>They twisted the story of the book, which was much better might I add, to make 'Anna' a rebel punk rocker with a bad attitude and a belly button ring. I think I may have appreciated this movie more if it had some more meaning.<BR>Some parts of the movie were really good and some parts were kind of stinky. No offense, but after Chad Michael Murray's character entered the movie, that's when the movie got boring. That's the word. Boring. Not bad, just kind of boring.<BR>Don't get me wrong though, it's a lot better than that Lizzie Maguire movie and What A Girl Wants, and I guess maybe littler kids might like it more than I did. But here's the breakdown.....<BR>THE MOVIE: Definitely worth watching, Definitely worth checking out of the library, Worth renting, Maybe not worth buying until you've seen it.<BR>AGES?: 4-6, probably wouldn't get it. 7-9 May like it. 10-13 - my age group....It was okay...kind of predictable. 13+ - most likely will find it boring.<BR>MOVIE RECOMMENDATIONS: Mean Girls (PG-13) for younger kids, The Parent Trap and Cheaper By The Dozen.<BR>OTHER: I recommend Freaky Friday, the book, wholeheartedly.
B000021Y7X|5.0|but it is my extremely entertaining, albeit &quot;contrived&quot; concert event. But that is not a bad thing ! as the resulting DVD manages to capture the energy and talent of a truly great American band. If I could go back in time, one of my first destinations would be the CBGB in New York City, 1977, to see the Talking Heads open for the Ramones. Obviously the Talking Heads stole every show, which is probably why the Ramones disliked them so much !<br />And even though the four members of the &quot;Talking Heads proper&quot; kind of get lost in this nine-member stage ensemble, David Byrne is still the clear leader, and the contributions of the other original band members are essential to the energy of the Talking Heads experience. and what an experience it is ! Every song is an artistic presentation, with the visual effects beautifully complementing the funky, up beat, afro-synchronic musical riffs. With absolutely radical versions of Life During Wartime and Once in a Lifetime, this is my second favorite musical DVD (second only to Led Zeppelin - which is really saying something !)
B000001E3V|5.0|To avoid repetition, I'll just say this: I first heard this album (remember those?) when I was a high school freshman, 32 years ago, and it's still one of my 5 favorite of all time. I saw Clapton in Atlanta 3 weeks ago, and his version of &quot;Got to get better in a little while&quot; was so good, so tight, it was hauntingly similar to the version on this cd.  This music is timeless and will be enjoyed by anyone at all interested in Clapton.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Honestly the best Slipknot album to date, anyone who disagrees is suffering from temporary insanity.
B000002U82|5.0|There are very few bands that ever stand out from any particular time period, even fewer that are remembered years later. When Pink Floyd recorcded Dark Side of the Moon, they crafted an album that glides from sublime easygoing to mesmerizing to the point of almost stunning. The almost erie opening of &quot;Speak to Me&quot; catches the ear with its subtlety and its barely audible sounds. Perhaps the most catchy (even if it is in 7/4 time!) tune on the album is &quot;Money&quot;. Probably the best feature of the album is the almost continous quality of the music, drifting from track to track, almost as if you were wandering through an art gallery of exsquisite artworks, and when you got out, you don't what the heck you looked at, but it was amazing. For someone who had never heard Pink Floyd before, this album blew me away with its quality of craftsmanship. A great first Pink Floyd album.
B00003CXIP|5.0|I've seen STAND BY ME too many times.  Now that I've gotten that off my chest, let me clarify that it doesn't mean I'll never watch it again.  Because STAND BY ME is one of those films you can watch again.  And again, and again...<br />Directed by Rob Reiner (THE PRINCESS BRIDE), STAND BY ME is based on a novella by bestselling author Stephen King.  Wanting to understand STAND BY ME's origins, I searched it out.  THE BODY can be found in an anthology of King stories entitled DIFFERENT SEASONS.<br />On to the movie...<br />STAND BY ME centers on four 12 year-old boys: Gordie Lachance (Wil Wheaton), Chris Chambers (River Phoenix), Teddy Duchamp (Corey Feldman), and Vern Tessio (Jerry O'Connell).  Their hometown is in Maine - Castle Rock, to be precise, and the year is 1959.  Castle Rock is a small, sleepy town where not much happens.  But the four pals manage to stir up mischief all on their own.  Especially on their journey through the woods.  They've got only one goal in mind: to find the dead body of a Castle Rock boy their age who was hit by a train.  Vern overheard Chris' older brother's gang talking about how they knew where it was, how they'd be rewarded for alerting the township.<br />River Phoenix shines throughout the movie, but not so much so that he overshadows his costars.  Each cast member gives an incredibly praise-worthy performance - the sleeper hit did garner quite a bit of critical praise during the 80's.  Jerry O'Connell, as Vern, is barely recognizeable.  With wide blue eyes, chubby cheeks, and a constant whine, he is the typical fat kid who always gets picked on.  Yet Chris, Gordie, and Teddy have taken him under their wing.  The four boys genuinely and sincerely care about each other and have relationships as tight-knit as that of blood brothers.<br />An older and more aware Gordie Lachance narrates the story with voice-overs as he has achieved his dream of being an author and wants to tell the world of the friends he shared many middle school experiences with.  \\"I never had friends like the ones I had when I was 12,\\" Gordie laments.  \\"Jesus, does anyone?\\"<br />STAND BY ME will always be the best film of its coming-of-age genre.  Why?  The boys set off on a journey with typical kid wishes: to make a profit from discovering the dead body.  But they learn to rely on each other, care about each other, and emerge self-assured and more mature as a result.   This film is poignant, touching, and dripping with nostalgia, as well as quite humorous.  Not once does it cross the border into being overly sentiment or sappy.  The adventures and misadventures of 4 boys who \\"come of age,\\" so to speak, is one to be remembered throughout film history.<br />R.I.P., River Phoenix.  At 14, I was in love.
0446608955|5.0|I really enjoyed A Walk to Remember, by Nicholas Sparks.  From beginning to end I was hooked to the story line, the characters, the joys and tears.  I would recommend this book, as well as The Notebook, The Guardian, and Message in a Bottle also written by Nicholas Sparks.  You won't be dissapointed, I sure wasn't.
1400031362|3.0|This is the second book I have read in this series and still have the impression that these books are very light on mystery.  I guess I would have to say this is more true for this book than the first one I read.  I have to agree with several of the other reviewers that there seemed to be more lose ends (or losely tied ends) that really didn't leave me satisfied. Beyond that, as a fictional read, the descriptions of the people and country have been consistantly good in both books.
B000089RVX|5.0|I love this album. All the songs are great!! The best one is going under. If you want to buy an album this is the one!!! This is the first album ive ever heard that i can listen to all of the songs!
1400034779|3.0|While this is very good writing, I just find it somewhat light on the mystery angle and feel it is more of a plain fictional read than part of a mystery series.  You get alot of wonderful descriptions of the people, country, traditions and the history.  The mystery part I guess is a few small jobs the agency takes on, and they usually solved rather quickly (and often predictably). I have read 2 of these books so far and found this to be true in both cases. So, I gave it the 3 stars because I think many mystery lovers are like me and want a real mystery to solve. However, as a good fictional read about a country and culture far away from us, I would give it the 5 stars.
B00005JKCH|2.0|simple as that. the movie was overrated and cheesy. toby mcguire looks like he's constantly seeing a ghost, and the green goblin looks like a retarded power ranger. the only fun thing in this movie when he'd go from building to building. other than that, if you had no idea who spiderman was and saw this movie, you'd think he was a manic depressive, because mcguire acts like one throughout the whole movie. spiderman needs to take some zoloft.
B00003CXMG|5.0|Director-writer Cameron Crowe's ode to rock n roll is more than<BR>just the coming of age tale he wanted to tell for a long time, it is the crowning achievement that not only vastly impressed critics, but it also vasly impressed audiences as well. This is<BR>an autobiographical account of Crowe's early days, working as a<BR>teenage reporter for Rolling Stone magazine, in which we are introduced to his alter ego, which is 15 year old William Miller<BR>(Played by newcomer Patrick Fugit), who gets introduced by rock<BR>music from his spiritual older sister Anita (Zooey Deschanel). Following this and the overprotective attitude of his mother (Played by the always entertaining Francis McDormand), William <BR>Miller goes on the road to interview the band Stillwater who is<BR>headed by the lead guitarist (Billy Crudup), from then on he starts to travel with these people and meets an upbeat and very<BR>beautiful road groupie named Penny Lane, who is played by the <BR>always gorgeous Kate Hudson, who not only gives a breakthrough<BR>performance, but delivers the performance of her career. I will<BR>stop talking here, just see this wonderful wonderful movie. Filmmaker Cameron Crowe may have been put on the map by Say Any-<BR>thing and Jerry Maguire, but it is Almost Famous that is his<BR>main crowning achievement and to prove it, he won a more than <BR>well deserved oscar for best original screenplay. Francis McDor-<BR>mand won a well deserved oscar nomination for best supporting <BR>actress. However it is the talent and gorgeous Kate Hudson who<BR>steals the show as rock groupie and wallflower Penny Lane. She<BR>was so great shw should have won the best supporting actress oscar. However Marcia Gay Harden won instead for her brilliant<BR>performance in Pollock, but I would have given Marcia Gay Harden<BR>the oscar for her performance in Mystic River instead.

B0000069DB|5.0|Gioacchino Rossini wrote two kinds of comic opera. First there was the manic, almost farcial \\"opera buffa\\" (eg. THE BARBER OF SEVILLE). Then there was a kind of serio-comedy akin to the \\"dramma giocoso\\" of Mozart. IL TURCO IN ITALIA (1816) definitely falls in the latter category (as does LA CENERENTOLA). This little-known opera is a real gem. It is about a Muslim prince (Selim, sung by Michele Pertusi in fine voice) from Turkey and the comedy and conflict that ensue when he visits Italy. A clash of cultures ensues as the polygamous Selim tries to steal Don Geronio's young wife, Fiorilla (mezzo-soprano Cecilia Bartoli, singing a role written for soprano). While the opera does not have as many memorable melodies or outstanding individual numbers as THE BARBER or CENERENTOLA, it is still a funny, compassionate comedy with some of Rossini's best music. The opera is surprisingly contemporary in feel, especially in the character of the Poet, who \\"writes\\" the opera as it unfolds. Bartoli, Pertusi, and Vargas are all excellent, but for me the stand-out is Alessandro Corbelli, who portrays the henpecked husband Geronio with musicality and sympathy. Just about any opera set with Corbelli on it is worth getting, as he is an extremely fine singing-actor in the Mozart/Rossini repertoire.
0312995423|5.0|If the story of the book is real or don't it really doesn't matter, or tell me Cinderella is for real? I am agree that many things in this book are nonsense, for example if you go to Seville Spain you will see that Spain is a first world country non a third world country as DB wanted us to believe, I am also agree that the first half of the book is excellent, then the middle part is boring and predictable, and at the end is like an american movie, but the book will keep you interested in the story and even if the end is like a fairy tale is a very good end.<br />Do you thing that what you do in the internet or the emails you send nobody see them? Let me tell you that the first non written rule in any company (ask where you work) is: &quot;Do not send by email anything that you want to keep secret.&quot; In the big companies all the inbound or outbound email is checked, take that for sure.
B0001Z52RU|4.0|It was 1230am when my cousin said he was finished watching this movie he rented with his wife and in his room. Me, not much of a movie goer decided to watch half tonight and half tomorrow. But I got into it and couldn't turn it off! It was like a good book that you can't put down.<br />Ashton did a fine job on this movie. So much different from his series on TV that I never really cared about.<br />The actors were different ages all thru the movie and them casting crew did a fine job of finding kids that looked alike when they got older. I was amazed. They really looked like the same kids.<br />The movies pace starts fast and ends fast, there are no slow parts and that is what keeps this movie going. I now had wished I saw it on the big screen.<br />Basically this movie talks about is how one event in your life can change the rest of it. How true that is. I highly recommend this movie!
1400034779|2.0|I was looking for something more like an Agatha Christie or M.M. Kaye when I picked up this book. In contrast to those books, this had little-to-no suspense. The characters are warm and the setting is interesting, but the book reads more like a series of short stories about Botswana and its people rather than a mystery. In themes, it's sort of a cross between &quot;The Color Purple&quot; and a Harlem-renaissance book called &quot;The Conjure-Man Dies&quot;, but much less interesting than both. I finished the book, there were some amusing vignettes, but overall it leaves much to be desired.
0765310015|5.0|No lost princes or kings (Aragon), no awkward teens who become the greatest warrior of all time, no conflicted reincarnations of mad wizards (I am looking at you Rand Al'thor), no elves, and best of all, NO HOBBITS (sorry Frodo, you were cool when I was six, but come on)...most importantly, we have a fixed ending (ten books, I am told), no endless Wheel of Time nonsense, just fantasy writing for grown ups.  It is dark, it is dense, but it is very, very good.  Characters actually die.  The history is big and dense and there aren't any classroom sections that grate on you. It picks you up and drops you off in another world.<BR>Get the rest of the five from Amazon.ca (with the exchange rate, they almost pay for themselves).<BR>Great book.
0590600176|5.0|This is a short story for younger children.  It is 28 un-numbered pages plus the title page, etc.  The writing is simple, and most of the space is taken up by large, full color illustrations.  The recommended age range of 3 to 7 seems about right, but it depends somewhat on the reading level of the child.  This review refers to the hardbound, printed edition.  It is not suitable for an audio version as most of the story is in the illustrations.<br />Like a camel getting its nose into the tent, a mouse gets its nose into the house.  What starts out as an offer of a cookie grows into list of demands.  But all is not for naught, as the mouse cleans the house.  I would like to know where to find that mouse (I would give it cookies and milk any day).<br />I highly recommend this story for younger children.
B00003CXCW|5.0|While widescreen films date back as early as 1930 (The Bat Whispers), Sunset Boulvard is not a widescreen DVD because Sunset Boulevard is not a widescreen film.
B00005T30L|4.0|So I've been watching some cult type movies recently. The ones that are referenced all the time, or half the people on livejournal have an icon of. Ghost world is one of those movies. I had no idea what the plot was about before I watched it. ( I was hoping it would be a supernatural movie, but alas, it is not)<br />I think its a good drama with some funny parts. The characters are realistic and likeable. Some parts make you think, oh that's like me, or thats like how so and so behaves. Which isn't seen very often in movies, perhaps thats why people like this so much. I dont think it's arty, though. Parts I didn't like: the bus thing, and what happened when she got drunk, and her typical 'I'm unique, really' scene/emo look. The rest I liked pretty much. The part where her teacher is analyzing someone piece of rubbish art is very true to life (turner prize, anyone?). It's a nice comedy drama type movie, and I would watch it again. Good acting too. Thanks for reading!
0385510438|4.0|Unlike most of Grisham's earlier works, like The Firm and The Pelican Brief, this book does not revolve around a life-or-death search for the truth behind a major conspiracy.  This book is a slow, leisurely-paced tome that traces the history of a small-town in Mississippi as told through the eyes of the 'Yankee' who takes over the local weekly newspaper.<br />Yes, there is a murder, but there's no mystery.  The murderer is sentenced to jail, and when he's released new murders occur. Most experienced readers will already know who the guilty party is, so the joy of the book must be taken from the old-fashioned story-telling rather than from solving a mystery.<br />I enjoyed this book, but won't be recommending it to people who enjoy brainless thrillers.
B00009EIQE|5.0|Buddy Guy has done it again. This recording is simply one of the best I have ever heard and was engineered beautifully. And to make it even more special, B.B. King and Eric Clapton make an appearance. This is an essential Buddy Guy CD.
B00005KFUM|5.0|I started listening to Muse about 8 months ago when my friend sent me the single &quot;Time is Running Out.&quot;  I absolutely loved it, and soon picked up this album.<BR>I will tell you that I think &quot;Absolution&quot; as a whole is a much better work, and one of my favorite albums ever.  This album doesn't quite live up, but it still is spectacular.<br />The work is best viewed as a whole in my opinion, kind of like a symphony where each track is its own movement.  While it does have a few spots where its a bit disjointed each track is great.<BR>From the quiet beginning in New Born to the grandiose finish, this piece moves from lyrical masterpiece to masterpiece.  One of their great aspects is that the songs go from style to style not stopping and never letting down for a minute.<BR> New Born takes you on a ride that never stops, from soft and lyrical to harder sections.  Plug In Baby is probably the one unforgettable single.  Feeling Good takes an 8 beat blues and makes it spectacular.  While I think each song is excellent, my own complaint is that the album as a whole tends to be incredibly forgettable. That to me is a downside, and while I love listening to the album, each time I come back its only vaguely familiar.<br />Nonetheless this is a great work, and I highly recommend it, but I'd suggest getting &quot;Absolution&quot; which is in my opinion their best album to date by far.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|The title says it all.  There is something so wrong with a company for cancelling this show
B0000640VO|3.0|Its quirky and pretty and all, but then it turns into a typical love story in the end. Dissapointing, I would rather it be a film where she makes everyones lives nicer, and this importance isn't placed on her Only Being Happy If She Gets The Guy. The actress is really pretty, there are nice scenes and ideas, parts are funny, but I don't understand why it has this cult status.
B0001ZX0PG|1.0|This movie was good until I got to the lazy ending. Great actors who did a great job, but what were they thinking? Glad I rented it instead of paying $9 to see it. Let me ruin in for you: it's always the guy you least expect that's the killer. Shocking. THAT'S never been done before. SO original. GRADE:C+
B00006V9A0|1.0|All your fan-favorites were lazily-rationed out over two major label albums because Kurt Cobain wasn't creative enough to create new songs to fill an entire LP album. Nirvana is as conventional as a band can get. Kurt Cobain lived and died by the two biggest rock cliches in the book: become a junkie and commit suicide. Everything about Nirvana's music was safe and tame; every last one of Cobain's songs had the same structure and never deviated from the norm. By 1991, nearly everything from Nevermind and In Utero had been written, finalized, and surprisingly to all of you fans, performed live more than a handful of times. Nothing Cobain put on his two major label releases were new. That is the tell-tale sign he wasn't a creative fellow. He just rationed out the songs he had previously written and saved them to stretch out over two albums. <br />Polly is from 1988. <BR>Breed is from 1989<BR>All Apologies and Rape me are from 1991.<BR>Drain You, Lithium, In Bloom, Lounge Act, Radio-Friendly Unit Shifter, Pay to Play (later changed to &quot;Stay Away&quot;) are all from 1990
6305627347|5.0|The point of any satire is to suggest that something that no one could possibly find acceptable is indeed acceptable in a sarcastic sense in order to insult a particular audience.  For example, Jonathan Swift (possibly one of the greatest satirists who ever lived) wrote a satire known as &quot;A Modest Proposal&quot;, which suggested that selling children as food was acceptable so that 17th century England could thrive despite Irish oppression at the time.  Swift was trying to make a point that Irish oppression was driving England to extreme poverty, and wanted the Irish government to feel stupid for it.  This is what &quot;South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut&quot; attempts to do to parents and people supporting censorship for the wrong reasons.  In this movie, it seems as though violence is acceptalbe, as long as people don't say any profane words (Infact, Kyle's overbearing mom states this at the movie's conclusion).  It is a seemingly ridiculous society, but everything that happens throughout the movie serves to emphasize that flipping out over the use of profane words in today's society is stupid, people who flip out like that are stupid, and that censorship should focus on what's really threatening to young minds.  Therefore, the fact that there are one-star reviews clearly illustrates that this movie did what it wanted to do.  Curse words were not thrown around just to be thrown around.  Rather, they were done so to show the typical reaction people have to hearing them, and this reaction was intentionally blown way out of proportion.  What an amazing satire...one that will hardly ever be matched anytime soon!  This is one of the most deceivingly deep, yet rebellious movies to ever come out.  I'm GLAD people were offended by it; they can join all the other squares in this world who would declare war on anyone who might accidentely slip out the f-word when frustrated.
1400034779|5.0|What a delightful and unusual book this is.<br />Precious Ramotswe is the owner of the eponymous Detective Agency which she set up following the sale of her late father's cows. It is the only Ladies Detective Agency in Botswana. <br />She is ably assisted by Mma Makutsi who acheived 97% in her secretrial examinations and Mr J L B Matekoni of the Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors. <br />The book takes us through the story of the birth of the agency and a number of her cases written a short stories within the book. It is not really  detective novel. Indeed anyone expecting this might be disapppointed.<br />It is a lovely portrayal of Botswana life. The pace is gentle. The humour is gentle and the characters are beautifully portayed. Especially Mma Ramotswe herself who confidently eats fruit cake as she does not need to worry about such things being a woman of 'Traditional African Build'. <br />This is one of five novels and they are all are highly recommended.
B000000OAC|5.0|One of the most fascinating things about Queen is their versatility: no two records sound alike. Of course, this is not good per se: they also have to be good records. As much as I love the band, I have to admit that not all their albums are masterpieces; but if I were to point out \\"Queen's top-three\\" albums, this would definitely be one of them (along with \\"Queen II\\" and, of course, \\"A night at the opera\\"). The reason is simple: apart of their better-known, classic/rhapsodic/operatic material (as one reviewer put it once), Queen was as powerful a band as there ever was, and \\"News of the world\\" is arguably the band's most straightforward rock'n'roll album. Songs like \\"We will rock you\\", \\"Sheer heart attack\\", and especially the breathtaking \\"It's late\\" show the band as loud as it gets. Brian May and Roger Taylor are responsible for the album's hardest songs, whereas John Deacon and Freddie Mercury wrote some of their most touching melodies: Deacon's \\"Who needs you\\", with its exquisit Latin flavor, and Freddie's heart-breaking \\"My melancholy blues\\" are among the band's crown jewels. And there's more to this record, which also includes the world-known \\"We are the champions\\" (a rock'n'roll equivalent to Beethoven's \\"Ode to Joy\\"), Brian May's \\"Sleeping on the sidewalk\\" (a very funny blues about a kid who tries to make it in the record business), Deacon's \\"Spread your wings\\" (a song that almost makes it into the \\"Greatest hits\\" album) and a Freddie Mercury extravaganza called \\"Get down, make love\\", despised by many Queen fans, but quite unfairly: it sure is no \\"Bohemian rhapsody\\", but it can turn on the heat on any party!
B000001Y5J|3.0|Broken is incredibly angry for NIN, considering that they tend to prefer angst to anger. However, the CD falls victim to the fact that it frequently lacks flow and in many cases it gets overly abbrasive.<br />First song (an instrumental) leads into the secon, &quot;Wish.&quot; This is the best song on the CD, and it is actually very good. Incredibly catchy and it avoids Trent's overuse of the loud-soft-loud-soft dynamic. It flows well, avoids being jerky and manages to actually be entertaining. Try getting that guitar hook out of your head!<br />The second track of note on this CD is &quot;Happiness In Slavery.&quot; The track is very complex, and has wonderfully morbid lyrics. However, the track falls down owing to two factors. The first is that it lacks continuity. It seems like it lurches between a Frontline Assembly track and a PHM era NIN track. This in turn causes the song to lack catchiness and continuity. The second problem is that it again follows the awful loud-soft-loud-soft gimmick. <br />The other songs are all somewhat unremarkable.<br />Overall, Broken showed Trent's skill increase, and NIN still sounds incredibly unique. However, the overall sound can get as bad as an in-sink garbage disposal with a guitar over the top. And even Frontline Assembly have somemelody in their tracks.
B000003TA4|1.0|Nirvana's Nevermind is boring, bottom-of-the-barrel rock music. Yes Virginia, the music scene in general was actually better in the days before Nirvana broke big. Nowadays, our music stations and channels are flooded with rap and rap-rock fusion. I see how everbody and their mother classifies Nirvana as &quot;Alternative&quot;, but the true meaning of anything alternative, whether it be music or a way of life, has to do with its unconventional nature. Nirvana was as conventional and formulatic as music gets. They were absolutely predictable, as was Kurt Cobain, who did something all of us expected he would; he killed himself. He gave in to the cliche that all rockers should &quot;live fast and die young&quot;. He was the ultimate conformist who loved bands including the likes of yuppie artsy-fartsy bands like Beat Happening. Kurt even had a tattoo that comemorated the corporation of K Records. Oddly enough it was owned and managed by Calvin Johnson, the Beat's yuppie singer! How Punk Rock &lt;snicker&gt;!
B000002TQV|5.0|Radiohead truly prove themselves to be masters of their craft and thoroughly proficient musicians with this release.  They do an extremely effective job of creating a sort of mental/emotionally melancholy mood that lasts throughout the album.  The highly effective tone of this album is especially personified by the songs 'Fake Plastic Trees' and 'Street Spirit'.  These songs have a very melancholy feel to them, yet do not feel heavy at all in their texture.  Radiohead somehow manages to make truly melancholy songs that feel really light.  Basically, listening to this album is a highly impressive, intense cerebral experience.  The band keeps things thoughtful, creative, and fresh all throughout.  One technique that they use to do this is to basically incorporate several stark changes into several songs all while keeping the overall feel of the song consistent.  I was turned onto this album around six months ago and I've really grown to respect and appreciate Radiohead as a group since then.  I've heard all of their albums after this one and this one is definitely the least experimental, but that also makes it the most accessible to those who are new to the group.  This album and \\"O.K. Computer\\" are both amazing modern rock masterpieces, but I feel that \\"O.K. Computer\\" is slightly greater, even though this is the album that I listen to most often.  They are both two of the greatest and most intricate rock albums to be released in the past fifteen years.   This is truly thoughtful and intelligent music here that works well as a whole and complete concept from beginning to end, and I encourage you all to take a listen.
B00005JKC3|1.0|In light of the other reviews, there's probably no need to address how bad this movies is. I just want to point out how fixed the stereotypes about the UC researchers, the military and the businesses are in the minds of the producer/director/screenplay writer that they couldn't help to lie about simple truth. <br />The UC researchers are by no means selfless heroes who invent for the benefit of everyone. As a matter of fact, the UC (especially Berkeley) are among the top patents receivers in the country and by licensing the patents to businesses, the UC receive solid income. And yes, the researchers' names are on the issued patents and they get paid for the new tech. In the movie, they're portrayed as communist idealists whose expertise is sought by greedy big businesses thirsty for contracts from the military. It's not just a twisted reflection of the truth. It's a humiliation of to the scientists themselves. <br />What's more, since the UC system is considered part of the state government of California, they're legally immune to various wrong-doings, including almost all anti-trust claims. That is, they can monoplize certain fields of scientific research and use the patents to exclude all others from their &quot;territory&quot; and therefore charge high licensing fees.
0060730552|5.0|This is a book that gets you thinking.  1.  Would I even try climbing an expert level mountain?  2.  Would I cut a lifeline sending my partner to certain death if I knew not cutting would kill us both? 3. Would I have the will to endure crushing pain and desperation when it all could be ended easily by just giving up?<br />I think the third question was easiest for me.  The will to live is just too great in most of us to give up.  However, as we read of Joe Simpson's incredible climb out of an icy hell -- on a severely broken leg, each step one of excruciating pain, we can understand when he asks himself the same question.<br />On the first, no.  I get all the tough mountain climbing thrills I need vicariously through Jon Krakauer's books or one's like this.  I understand that some are driven to assault the globe's most difficult peaks, but I just don't see the point.  Almost all of the wonderful mountaineering books of the last decade involve death and mayhem among people who knowingly chose to place themselves in positions where those outcomes were a high probability.<br />The second question is the most difficult and the one the reader will ask himself over and over during this very well written book.<br />Joe Simpson and Simon Yates climbed a forbidding peak in South America alone, with their only support a neophyte camped a few miles from the starting point in a camp itself a day's mule ride away from civilization.  The climb up went well enough, but on the way down the snow encrusted and storm tossed mount, Simpson broke his leg horribly in a fall.  Improvising a plan for Yates to lower Simpson down a crevice riddled glacier one painful rope length at a time, the pair started their self-rescue at night.  The first few hours went painfully slow, then Simpson reeled over a cliff into nothingness.  Unable to see what had befallen Simpson, Yates hung on above -- the rope slowly but surely pulling Yates himself toward the abyss.  Knowing (in both their minds at that time according to the book) that to hold on would kill them both, Yates made the supremely difficult decision to cut the rope -- condemning Simpson to a long fall and probable death -- to save himself.<br />The next morning after climbing down, Yates could only see a snow covered crevice which he assumed his friend had plummeted into from high above.  Unknown to Yates, Simpson had miraculously landed on a snow ledge below the lip of the crevice -- mangled leg and all.  The weak ice roof of the crevice had slowed his fall enough to permit survival.  Yates went off to camp heavy with the knowledge he had killed his friend and sure the world would neither understand nor forgive.<br />Simpson, meanwhile, endured a 48 hour plus ordeal to drag his wrecked body 50 or so feet out of the crevice and then over miles over rough ground to camp.  As you might imagine, the reuniting of Simpson and Yates was quite a scene.<br />This book is taught and well written.  Although Simpson's book, Yates is given space to describe in his own words the story from his perspective from the point he thought his fateful decision had separated their paths.<br />This is a great survival story and leaves the reader asking:  &quot;Would I, could I, have cut the rope?&quot;t time according to the book) that to hold on would kill them both, Yates made the supremely difficult decision to cut the rope -- condemning Simpson to a long fall and probable death -- to save himself.<br />The next morning after climbing down, Yates could only see a snow covered crevice which he assumed his friend had plummeted into from high above.

As you might imagine, the reuniting of Simpson and Yates was quite a scene.<br />This book is taught and well written.  Although Simpson's book, Yates is given space to describe in his own words the story from his perspective from the point he thought his fateful decision had separated their paths.<br />This is a great survival story and leaves the reader asking:  &quot;Would I, could I, have cut the rope?&quot;
B000060P79|5.0|When Simple Plan first came out, I didn't really know what to expect. I thought they were going to have pretty much the same type of music as SUM 41 and Good Charlotte, but once I listened to the CD, it was different. They may be a little punk/pop band like Good Charlotte and SUM 41, but they have their own music and it's stuff people can relate to. It's not hard rock, and yet it's not bubblegum pop.. it's punk music. I think it's a GREAT CD.
0553106635|5.0|This series is very compelling, and the device of switching the narrative between several characters helps move the story along as well as motivating the reader to keep reading! I quickly became enamoured of certain storylines (Jon Snow, Tyrion, Arya), and would read through other chapters so I could get back to the ones I enjoyed the most. Martin (who invokes the spirit of Tolkien with that double &quot;R&quot; initial business) throws in some dramatic and unexpected plot twists, and his character development and attention to detail is excellent. The series reads like historical fiction, chock full of political intrigue (apparently it's based loosely on The War of the Roses), but with enough fanatsy to perk it up a bit. I like that he doesn't stray too far in the fantasy direction by busting out elves or hobbits, or by getting into too many magical shenaningans. There are enough books like that already! The dragons are the farthest limb he goes out on, and they are good fun (especially when roasting off someone's face). I give this series my highest recommendations, but with one warning: it takes FOR FREAKIN' EVER between books! The fourth in the series has been over 4 1/2 years in the making, and apparently there will be 2 more volumes over the next ten years or so. If you can bear to wait that long &amp; are willing to invest years of your life in finding out the fate of these characters, buy the series &amp; dive right in. You, like me, will soon be haunting Amazon.com for updates on the release date of the fourth volume. C'mon George!!
B000021YQV|5.0|I've been involved with music all of my life.  Since I can remember, my father blazed Sabbath and Ozzy from the stereo.  I remember the big-hair bands of the 80's and the grunge bands of the 90's.  Exceptional bands have always been far and few between.<br />People like the Oz-man, who actually orchestrate their music.  Not only do the lyrics mean something, but the music has more than 3 chords.<br />SOAD brings just that to the table.  The music is thick...very thick.  It's stuff kids can still bang their heads to, but for the real listeners, you can hear some stuff going on.  The lyrics...at first glance might seem like your average B.S.  not so.  Theres a real message to what's being said.  Plus I love the switch-up between melodies.  good stuff.
0465011020|5.0|I came across this book after reading Tears of My Soul.  I have to say that this book is absolutely captivating.  It is a very quick read, but the impact will last forever.  With so little information coming out of N.Korea unfiltered, this book and its perspective is invaluable.  I recommend this book to everyone, to the point that people must think I am the publisher.  Excellent book.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Ok, honestly, I never really liked Christina, but I have to say, this album is really completely different from her first. It does have some naughty songs, and gives off bad messages to younger children, like as in &quot;Get Mine, Get Yours&quot; ..with bad lyrics saying things like &quot;So, come on and freak my body, We can get nasty, naughty&quot; and I think those kind of things aren't for younger children to be listening to. Although there are some bad messages in these songs, the album is amazing. She has great vocals, and it has more of an R &amp; B feel to it this time.
B000002KHH|5.0|All discussion aside, this is without a doubt the greatest album in metal history.  Never since Black Sabbath has any metal band revolutionized rock music so much.  Toni Iommi, the god of heavy metal guitar, is in his prime on this album, with some of his fastest and heaviest riffs ever, even with two butchered fingers.  Ozzy Osbourne, revered as the Godfather of Modern Metal, is awesome here, seeing as no one could sing songs like these as well as the Ozzman himself did.  Bill Ward truly rocks on this album, even having his own drum solo.  And last, bust CERTAINLY not least, Geezer Butler, possibly the greatest bassist to ever grace the world of music, proves himself nowhere else better than on Paranoid, the primier heavy metal band's second musical effort.<br />1) War Pigs - This is Black Sabbath's best song, bar none.  Absolutely breathtaking.  11/10<br />2) Paranoid - One of the rare moments when a filler becomes a band's most popular song ever.  Short and sweet, this song never gets old.  10/10<br />3) Planet Caravan - I used to hate this song, but now i listen to it just as much as the others.  A very underrated tune, this bizarre smoothe rocker displays some of Geezer's best work. Try the Pantera cover as well.  8/10<br />4) Iron Man - One of the heaviest, doomiest, and catchy of any Sabbath tune.  Awesome distorted guitar, fast bass playing, clever drumming, vocals, everything on this track is sure to please any metalhead.  10/10<br />5) Electric Funeral - Starts off as a slow, sludgy, doomsday song, then slowly transitions into a quick and powerful blues/jazz tune.  Good stuff.  9/10<br />6) Hand of Doom - Probably my second favorite Sabbath song.  One of the few songs ever in which the bass does a good job at carrying the song, especially for 7 minutes.  An incredibly underrated track, this, like many other Black Sabbath songs, is overlooked for either its meaning, length, or some other excuse.  Listen closely, this song holds an important message.  11/10<br />7) Rat Salad - A 2 and a half minute instrumental, 45 seconds being a talented drum solo.  Sort of a tribute to John Bonham's Moby Dick on Led Zeppelin II.  8/10<br />8) Fairies Wear Boots - The album closes with a big bang with the jazz-inspired 'Fairies Wear Boots'.  Kind of a funny song about the perils of drug addiction.  Awesome song.  9/10<br />Average - Exactly 9.5/10 (5 stars)<br />If you do not own this album, you should be ashamed for calling yourself a Black Sabbath fan.  This album proves that all good music will stand the test of time.  Buy this album.  It's that simple.  You won't regret it, I promise.<br />Peace, everyone, and keep rockin'.
B00005JMEW|2.0|I tried to like the movie. I really did. <br />I watched it with a very close friend who appreciates it very much, and I wanted to share in that appreciation. But the film just doesn't do it for me. It's hollow and pointless, postmodern when postmodernism has just gone out of fashion.<br />Kill Bill, vol. 1 is a deviant gore-fest of 60s-era martial arts melee. Briefly, a plot synopsis. The pregnant Bride (known to the viewer by the codename Black Mamba), professional assassin of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad (DiVAS, for short), is shot down by her former compatriots during her wedding ceremony. All participants are murdered; yet somehow Black Mamba herself survives in comatose form. Waking up four years after the murder spree, she begins to recollect who she is and what has happened to her. Thus remembering, she decides to go on a murderous rampage, intent on slaying (in the most gruesome possible fashion) every member of DiVAS, including Bill, who is apparently the leader of the gang. <br />First things first. Kill Bill is--literally--nothing more than Charlie's Angels in reverse. A secret gang of female special operatives, headed by an unseen male. The only difference is the sadism prevalent in DiVAS, whereas Charlie's Angels is harmless.<br />This is admittedly my introduction to Tarantino's work; yet if this is his \\"best\\" he has to offer, I cringe at the possibility of watching his \\"lesser\\" films. Granted, Mr. Tarantino intended the movie to be as over the top on the gruesomely sadistic scale as it is; granted, he intended to essentially plagiarize an entire generation of action flicks. I understand all that. What I don't understand, is why. Some critics have tried to save the film by calling it \\"artistic\\".<br />There are, in fact, some scenes which shine out. The anime sequence is a bold move, and some occasional cinematographic trick of the lens adds a nice touch to a scene, but none of that is in any way original. I can't tell you how many times I've seen a black and white sequence with only the eyes colored in. Or how many times a movie shifts from black and white in the beginning scene to color later. That's right, the same essential device is used twice in the same film. That's not only unoriginal, it's almost insulting.<br />Artistic movies have a message--there is no message or moral to Kill Bill. It's just a sequence of bloody pictures one after another. There is almost no struggle. The only decent part, which I found actually interesting, is the reaction of the Japanese swordmaster's request by Black Mamba to craft a new sword, ten years after he vowed to never again do so. The swordmaster is the only real character--everyone else is a garish, one dimensional image. Unfortunately for the viewer, the swordmaster is gone after only ten minutes.<br />It's an intentionally unrealistic movie with virtually no plot to begin with and therefore by necessity lacking in any plot development until the very end (when Tarantino uses a faded director's trick: introducing a totally unreasonable factoid to create a cliff-hanger in the very final scene), without any reason to be. I wouldn't risk the waste of money.
0871137380|5.0|I first hear about this book years ago when someone suggested it on tv.  But I did not pay it any attention until I saw the movie.  Once I saw the movie I wanted to know more about what happened with those soldiers.  What I loved about the book was Mark Bowden's attention to detail.  It is as if you are reading a very long but very interesting news article.  I did not sense any bias, as if Mr. Bowden was trying to lead me to see only one side of this story.  Needless to say, the book is very informative and has given me a new favorite author.  I am reading his other book &quot;Killing Pablo&quot; now and loving it.  Read Blackhawk Down.
B000089RVX|5.0|Evanescence is just ..wow.. they are amazing. This album is a powerful rock album and Amy Lee has so much talent. I didn't really listen to this 'deep rock' music as some may call it, I was more into the punk music, but this CD is really great. I love all of the songs and I can listen to the CD for hours and never get tired of it. Some of my favorites are &quot;Going Under, Bring Me To Life, My Immortal, Tourniquet and My Last Breath&quot;.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I bought this CD the day after it came out.  I was eagerly awating it for months and when it finally came out and I listened to it I was shocked.  &quot;Accoustic guitar!&quot; I bellowed, &quot;This isn't right!  This isn't their usual stuff!&quot;  Then something dawned on me:  I was glad!  Sure, please don't get me wrong I lOVED Slipknot(their first CD) and Iowa, but they needed something new, and this cd delivered it.  It has everything you could possible want on it ranging from heavy metal to haunting accoustic songs.  My advice for everybody is to buy this CD and if you don't like it at first then don't worry, I didn't either, but listen, and I mean really listen to it, again once you cool off and I assure you that you'll love it.
B0000507PC|5.0|This adaptation of John Irving's book, features a terrific mix of younger and veteran actors; lead by Michael Caine, Jane Alexander, and Kathy Baker.  With Tobey Maguire and Charlize Theron; among others, this movie has a perfect mix of drama, tearjerking emotions, and some very intense moments.  While I originally bought the movie for Michael Caine, and to see the lovely Ms. Theron, the story was told well enough and acted well enough to sustain the movie.  It is a first rate movie and I'd highly recommend it.  I look forward to reading the book (I know it should have been the other way around).  The &quot;making of&quot; feature helps to convey what emotions the actors, the director, and others; including Stephen King, of all people, felt in making and seeing the movie.  Definitely worth looking at [refers to vhs; but I'm likely to be buying the DVD in future].
B000060K4O|5.0|This film phenomenon still holds up two decades later, with still passable special effects and great lines and performances from a very talented cast -- Bill Murray at his acerbic best, Rick Moraniss, Dan Ackroyd, Sigourney Weaver et al.  DVD extras are very good and include: a text commentary (which works very well), a video, an original making-of featurette and a 1999 featurette, a sfx featurette, trailer, drawings and storyboard comparisons and 10 deleted scenes.  The film can only be heard or subtitled in English.<br />Revisit your past -- you won't be disappointed!
B00004ZD69|5.0|First of all this music is not for everyone, some find it boring and repetitive(i hope that I spelled taht correct). However if you enjoy long instrumental music, this is THE album for you.<BR>I discovered this band through a live performance I heard on the radio, I was so hypnotised by the music, that I went out and bought every album they had out. I have to say that this is my favorite together with the slow riot EP. These two records are simply the best in this sort of music.<BR>If you like bands like Mogwai or Explosions in the sky, you should really buy this album. You can also try any A Silver Mount Zion album, they're beautiful as well.
B0002BO0AS|5.0|First off ive been a fan of unearth since there first cd and they are just a great hardcore/metal band they are one of the best out there and right now seem to be THE BEST. This cd is there best to date with more complex rifs and better breakdowns and nice drumming since the new drummer got on. All in all to who ever thinks this is there 2nd best with Sting the best is wrong this cd is the best i love this cd buy buy buuy buuuuy buuuuuy buuuuuuuuuuy buuuuuuuuuuuuyyy NOW<BR>If you dont buy this cd you have no taste in hardcore/metal music<BR>and need to get the new Simple plan cd and have a lame time

B00006JDVV|3.0|This sure seems like it should be a winner, and as someone who enjoyed all the Mad Max movies and who likes Matthew McConaughey and Christian Bale, I was prepared to be thoroughly entertained, but this was a mess that started out well and then deteriorated.  Strangely enough, things seemed to grind to a halt when McConaughey's character (Van Zan) enters the picture, so to speak.  And who thought it was a good idea to take a good looking guy like McC and turn him into a bald cigar-chomping neanderthal?  The dragons were excellent and the sets and design were great, but the script and plot needed work.<br />DVD extras include a trailer, a 12-minute conversation with director Bowman, a 15-minute making-of featurette and an 8-minute sfx featurette.  The film can be heard in English or French and subtitled in English or Spanish.
B00013RC9I|5.0|I was loaned this album while at the Gojo Guest House  in Kyoto. I listend to it all day while I wallked about town. It was pure magic. The perfect touch to the melencholy beauty of Japan on a rainy day. This album is amazing. It holds a special place in my heart, helping me to recall the misty(sic) streets of Kyoto.
B0001MDP3G|4.0|I enjoyed the movie except towards the ending.   It's like you grow to like the character while you are watching the movie, and then he is killed off which I find it hard to accept.<BR>Inman's death seems to make all the sufferings in the movie pointless. I don't think the test of their love for each other warrants the Inman's death to make it complete.  And, the way he died, so \\"worthless\\", chasing a \\"fugitive\\" and then get killed.  Thus, it makes the movie  not satisfying.<BR>In retrospect, this is not the movie I will watch again and again and the only lasting impression it made on me is I feel \\"cheated\\" by the ending.<br />ps: During reunion, I find Nicole Kidman and Jude Law not so \\"passionate\\" when they were talking, esp. when Jude Law said,\\"I marry you, I marry you .....\\"  Not sure whether his acting was too good to play an introvert or he hadn't put enough emotion into it.
B0000004V2|5.0|This masterpiece is testament to the fact that melody produces the best music. Buy it before you die. It will make you happy.
B0001MDP3G|4.0|I really enjoyed watching this movie--and Renee Zellwegger stole the show!  What I find curious is how everyone says this is a &quot;love story&quot;--I don't really see it that way.  No one seems to remember the &quot;goat lady&quot; and her inciteful comments (the seed, the bird, etc.).  The story centers on Inman coming home and the impact he has on events.  If he hadn't come home at that exact time, Ruby, Ada and others would have died, Ada's farm would have been taken from her, and Ada wouldn't have become pregnant with his child.  All these events could have been tragic, but by Inman coming home they were changed.  Yes, there is a love story, and yes, there are battle scenes and the long road home--but the jist of the story is how one person can change everything.  I hope those who haven't watched the movie yet will watch it from a different angle.
B00005NEUF|5.0|The creative fuel that drives mandy rock stars to create masterpieces can either be clear or hidden. The strokes leave little to the imagination in regard to their juviant drive. Women and alcohol are the two main focuses on this amazing debuet. This import is the real version of Is This It? and in my opinon contains the best Strokes song yet to be recorded. NYC Cops is an epic track that is shroded in a rockstar mystisicm that hasn't been felt since L.A. Women. Any true Strokes fan should purchase this album based on the premise of NYC Cops and the original coverart.
0141301104|5.0|They are completely bald and always wear wigs, constantly sneaking hands underneath to scratch their itchy scalps.  They don't have any toes and have really broad feet, but they force their feet into narrow, fashionable shoes to blend in.  They have really long, curved fingernails that they usually hide by wearing gloves.  They are the witches.  And the meanest, nastiest witches live in England, where a boy has just gone to live with his grandmother after his parent's tragic death.<br />His grandmother always warned the boy about suspecting nice women who offer him candy - check for gloves, wigs and pinched feet.  He is able to avoid the witches until his grandmother becomes ill and they go to a seaside resort where the English witches are having a convention just like normal people in the hotel.  Stunned, the boy overhears the grand witch's plot to eliminate all of the children in England by feeding them candy that will turn them into mice!  When he is discovered, the boy knows that the witches are going to kill him, but they test the potion on him instead.  Now in mouse form, the boy and his grandmother must use all of their wits and cleverness to defeat the witches' evil scheme!<br />The Witches is a highly entertaining book by the always inventive Roald Dahl.  You would think that a book about witches would be scary, but Roald Dahl has just the right combination of humor and lightheartedness to balance out the scariness.  I loved this book when I was growing up and have enjoyed sharing it with my younger siblings and nephews.  It is true that it has a couple of slow parts as the author takes the time to set up the story, but the storyline is just so imaginative that you get caught up in the story and don't really notice until you have read it a couple of times.  With all of the many details, Roald Dahl can easily convince you that witches are real and that there really are women out there like that!  Humor aside, it does show that you should never take candy from strangers - no matter what they look like!  Although this book is great for reading alone, it is best when real aloud and shared with children, who always know the right parts to gasp at!m strangers - no matter what they look like!  Although this book is great for reading alone, it is best when real aloud and shared with children, who always know the right parts to gasp at!
B000066I6N|5.0|Robert Plant continues to climb by building his own stairway upon Monsalvat! The air's very thin and the climb strewn with failed expeditions. Few endevors outside of the very best classical music can bring about such an emotional upheaval. Pure grace glides from the speakers and takes you on a journey to distant realms.<br />I agree the disc centers on death, but it is the celebration of a life well lived, not the regrets of unfulfilled potential. I caught the Austin City Limits repeat several months ago and was so engaged, it never occurred to me to make a copy until after the credits had roled. So be it, a sacred event is only intensified by it's passing. <br />They say that genius fades with time, but there's always exceptions. Here's one of them.
B00005JMSE|5.0|He's gruff-voiced, he's *BIG* he's ... OK, he's not red & doesn't have horns.  But as Hellboy, Guillermo del Toro was right: there could be no other person to BE HellBoy.<br /><br />I've never missed a Ron Perlman flick, so i went to see this w/my husband Donald & Cat, my [well, i own 340 lbs of his 380 lb frame] ex-EOD Viet vet.  Where we all had a blast, despite the 'errors' in firepower [some of the kick from the guns would have knocked the guys down].<br /><br />Whether playing a Neandertal [in -Quest for Fire-], a feline alien [Vincent in \\"Beauty & the Beast\\"] or the hunchback [in -Name of the Rose-], Ron Perlman seems to have been born to work under pounds & pounds of latex ... & create a believable characted.  Altho Salma Hayek is sweet as HB's queeze, Perlman's wistful yarning after her is what makes this movie soar.<br /><br />Well ... that, and his cats & huge cigars...
6305350205|4.0|I take it not everyone is well versed in Star Trek history or Hollywoods knack for messing things up. The truth is this: The Budget was cut, so William Shatner couldn't even use the Special Effects he intended to! Also, Shatner didn't have his hands on the reigns completely througout filming. What really happened is a lot of people in charge pretty much told him to cut some of the movie out (atleast an hours worth!), forget about the Special effects and NO! Sean Connery will not play Sarek, and etc., etc. Instead of knowing the truth, too many people assume the movie stinks because of Shatner. Perhaps if Shatner had gotten the chance to make the film like he wanted, it could have been one of the best. Needless to say, of ALL the ST films, this one gave the characters actual personalities. It showed they had lives and loves outside of the Federation. And it was hilarious! Like I said, don't knock the man, it really WASN'T his fault, but then again, if anyone cared to find out the truth, they would know all this already!
B000068G9X|4.0|Former Misfits and Samhain singer Glenn Danzig turned out this solo self titled debut which found the perfect melody and mix of blues and metal.  From the awesome and catchy opener &quot;Twist of Cain&quot;, which will have you banging your head in no time, to the blusey &quot;She Rides&quot;, &quot;Am I Demon&quot;, and the popular rocker &quot;Mother&quot;, this album found Danzig and his crew (including former Samhain bassist Eerie Von, guitarist John Christ, and drummer Chuck Biscuits) still a little rough around the edges, but the band would get better as the album's progressed (the best Danzig album by far is &quot;Danzig 3: How the Gods Kill&quot;) and Glenn's voice never sounded better up until this album.  If you've never listened to any of Danzig's solo work, or if you like a little blues influence with your metal, then check this out.
078322947X|5.0|THIS IS NOT THE INTENDED VERSION!!The Spotlight review by ZENCIRCUS is WRONG!! Yes, William Friedkin was a television director. And yes, he has been quoted as saying he hates widescreen formatting. But this version HAS BEEN MODIFIED to fit a standard TV screen at 1.33:1. When you play this DVD version; IT STATES THIS at the beginning of the film. This underrated masterpiece was SHOT in a ratio aspect of 1.66:1. What that means for those of you who don't understand: if your screen was 1 foot high it would be 1.66 feet wide. This version is only 1.33 feet wide as it is 1 foot high. So, this version is NOT as wide as it was originally shot. Some of the image on the sides HAS been lost. Although, when you look at the ratio, not much is being lost. But to a real film purist, THERE IS A DIFFERENCE.<br /><br />YOUR WRONG ZENCIRCUS!! Another version of this classic DOES EXIST. Get your facts straight. And don't hold strong opinions about things you don't understand. Anyone who really loves film, should go to GOOGLE, type in \\"UNDERSTANDING ASPECT RATIOS,\\" and learn about it. I did. Apparently ZENCIRCUS didn't do his homework. Unless William Friedkin chimes in here to correct me, his review is WRONG and should be removed from the Spotlight.
B00008EYA5|1.0|If you enjoyed the TV series, don't waste your time watching this movie. The acting is poor and the plot is even worse.
B00005UKE0|5.0|What can I say that hasn't already been said?  Well, nothing, but oh well.  This record easily beats out any of the other records put out by the other Beatles at this time.  Also, after being shut up for so many years, George was finally able to freely write, record, and release his own work.  Sure, Phil Spector's production seems overblown today, and I'll admit that I'm not a huge fan of his &quot;wall of sound&quot; technique, but &quot;All Things Must Pass Naked&quot; would be a terrible travesty and an insult to the music that George Harrison made.  It also stands as a testament to the times.  Almost every song on this record is excellent, and even the songs that aren't as good are still WAY better than anything released today.  My personal favorites are &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot;, &quot;Wah-Wah&quot;, &quot;Isn't It A Pity&quot; (The version from side 1), &quot;What Is Life&quot;, &quot;Let It Down&quot;, &quot;Beware Of Darkness&quot;, &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;, and &quot;Art Of Dying&quot;.  I've seen several complaints that George is too preachy on some songs (i.e. &quot;Awaiting On You All&quot;).  Well, George was a religious person, and he wrote good enough lyrics, so it doesn't matter if it's too preachy.  The bonus tracks are pretty good, although I prefer the original &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; to the reworked version, but that one's also pretty good.  Also, I think that Phil Spector should have used the backing track of &quot;What Is Life&quot; offered in the bonus tracks, instead of the original, but that's just a small detail.  I'm also glad that the Apple Jam was preserved, instead of left off, because you can't blame them for jamming, especially when you have an all-star team like they did on this record.  My only beef is that the Apple Jam is out of order.  Overall, this is definitely an essential record to any rock music collection, and if you're a guitar player, you'd like the Apple Jam.
B00020HEL6|5.0|This young singer has a tremendous voice, and a wonderful and unique jazz style.  She sings classic songs with animation and a great deal of pizzaz.  Don't let the fact that this is a debut album from a VERY young girl scare you - she is well beyond her years and is unique in style.  No copy-cat, 'American Idol sounds like everyone else,' or canned singing here - she's terrific!  You'll be pleasantly surprised.  Congratulations Renee!
B00005QGAT|5.0|Back in the day this record was all over the clubs. A SOUL CLASSIC and Michael's best dance record. So why does EPIC have to gum it up with commentaries? Put that kind of stuff on a separate disc if it must be included. This kind of stuff is all too prevalent in remastered reissues. Record companies should just LEAVE IT ALONE. Put out the reissues the way they were intended. I just wanna hear the music, man.
B0000542DH|5.0|This true masterpiece directed by acclaimed director and writer, Oliver Stone, is avant-garde filmaking at its breaking point.  The whole theme of Natural Born Killers is that the media is obsessive over violence and brutality; therefore, the extreme violence in the movie is used as a satire, not as entertainment.  Definitely one of the most controversial movies ever released, especially in the 1990s when the Simpson trial, Rodney King, and the Menendez brothers became celebrity darlings because of the mass media and not because of anything credible.  The acting by all the leads, especially Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis, is amazing.  Their true love is another theme that proves vital in Natural Born Killers.  It is the one and only thing that can hold people together when faced with such things as violence and a tormented childhood.  The actual violence portrayed is not even that graphic after one viewing.  It is the break-neck pacing and high-speed cuts that give the movie its violent intensity.  If not Woody Harrelson, then definitely Juliette Lewis should have received some sort of Academy nomination, such as an Emmy, if not an Oscar.<br />Oliver Stone beats one in the face with this media spectacle that boasts every type of film style imaginable.  Everything from 36 mm to black and white to animation to a video camera to color tinting to fast and slow motion is used in abundance with fascinating success.  Roger Ebert said, &quot;Seeing this movie once is not enough,&quot; and he is right!  A must see.<br />Brilliant Filmaking!
B000063CPL|4.0|Iron Maiden's intensity and overall furosity are captured nearly perfectly on this CD. Bruce's voice seems somewhat weak in the beginning (noticable on The Wickerman, or maybe it's just because the 250,000 screaming fans drown his voice out). Either way it improves greatly by the 4th song so it really doesn't bother me. The musicianship is perfect, at no point is there is a mess-up. The guitar solos are awesome. I think it could have benefitted from a few tracks for solos. Like Heartbreaker and Moby Dick on How the West Won it would have been great to hear these guys no-holds-barred solo. But alas they do not and that is my only complaint.
B0001W8Q9Y|5.0|You are a rude,an ignorant,you can't understand this album because you are stupid.Britney Spears don't play this music,Spears sings only her songs.Please before to speak nonsense try to listen true music.Ignorant!!!!!!!!

B00000JPHG|3.0|chucky is ressurected by a voodoo [prostitute].she gets turned into a doll too.so now theres 2 killer dolls.the voodoo [prostitute] was a [prostitute] in let it ride and liar liar also.kids wont gain anything positive by viewing this one.they spent more money on this one than before so its easier to sit through.it is easily the best chucky movie.there is two ok chick s .who does NOT strut her stuff .there are a few irritating characters.a control freak cop and his lackey and a whole smorgasboard of spasmadic-drama queens wrapped up in a mans body.i just dont see why movie audiences feel it necessary to throw a jerry springer style gay man into every movie.so what?youre gay.get over it.the real deal is this is the most violent and also the funniest teen horror film in a long long time.
B00025ETIW|5.0|This album is increadible. If you are looking for an aggressive and emotional album at the same time, you will be served with that one. Gerard Way, has an amazingly beautiful voice and sings with so much emotion. The album is way better than the first one in my opinion and the sound is greatly improved because of the better production since they signed with a major label. <br />Don't be fooled by people saying they modified their style to sell more albums. They have a unique sound and they just improved a lot. Every song is catchy and it is not soft emo I am telling you. Not much screaming but there sure is some aggressivity in there. Besides song 8, which is the interlude, there is no break on this record. Get ready to rock for 40 minutes.<br />They are original and this album is a masterpiece.<br />Here is my review song by song:<br />1. Helena: Really Emotional song. What a way to start an album. I fell in love with this one the first time I heard it on the band's website. Great Chorus which could keep playing into your head for hours. My second favorite. 10/10<br />2. Give'em Hell, Kid: This song as a faster pace and once again Gerard sings it with a lot of emotion. Not as catchy as some others but a great rocking song. 8/10<br />3. To the end: This one is softer. Great chorus. Good lyrics. Great guitar riffs. 8/10<br />4. You know what they do to guys like us in prison: This song is amazing. It starts slowly with a nice rythme and it kicks ass for the rest of the 2-3 minutes or so. This song is perfect. It rocks hard, good chorus, great riffs, amazing. My favorite. 15/10<br />5. I'm not Okay: This is the first single of the album. It is softer and could be played on the radio. Still an amazing chorus and great pace, lyrics, riffs etc. Gerard is real in that one and he delivers the message pretty well. 10/10.<br />6. The Ghost of you: This is the softest song on this record. Great singing. Nice ending when there is only 1 minute left. Not my favorite but I can never skip it. 8/10<br />7. The jetset life is gonna kill you: From my point of view it's the worst song on this album and still I love it. Not much to say about that one it just didn't reach me as the others did. 7/10<br />8. Interlude: Ok it's just an interlude but damn it's good ! n/a<br />9. Thank you for the venom: Another song you could hear on mychemicalromance.com. It is a quick pace song and it as a catchy chorus. This might be your favorite song as it is for many people. It sure is one of my favs. 9.5/10<br />10. Hang'em High: This is probably the song that sounds the most like their previous album. Nice little intro, I love the little whistle. My favorite &quot;fast-paced&quot; song of the album (hummm, they are almost all are fast-paced but, oh well !). 9/10<br />11. It's not a fashion statement, it's a deathwish: This one is not gonna be an all of fame but it's good. I love it. 8/10<br />12. Cemetery Drive: Not much to say about that song. It's a catchy song. Once again not my favorite but don't I love them all ??? 8/10<br />13. I never told you what i do for a living: This song rocks and I love the slow ending. Great way to finish an album. 8/10<br />Conclusion:<br />This album is wonderful. If you like to rock and to sing along then you will not waste your money on that one.<BR>This is of course in my top 5 CDs ever. I only wish they will stop by Montreal soon because I'm sure they are breathtaking live.<br />Even if you are a fan of metal or hardcore where there is a lot of deep screaming don't turn your back on Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge. Try it, you will adopt it.

B0001UL7RY|4.0|On Avril Lavigne's freshman album she worked with production duo the Matrix, and recorded a solid album of mainly guitar-driven pop/folk/punk tracks.  Now with her sophomore album out, Avrils growth as a person both lyrically and vocally are apparent, but even more notable is the heavy influence the production teams she chooses to work with has.  Don't be mistaken, its not like Avril has done a drastic 180, in fact there are very strong parallels that can be drawn between certain tracks and sounds on this disc to her last one - but in general the album shows increased growth - from everything to the lyrics to the instrumentation of each song.<br />&quot;Take Me Away&quot; (similar to 'Losing Grip' on her first album), &quot;Together&quot;, &quot;Nobody's Home&quot;, and &quot;Forgotten&quot; are all produced by Don Gilmore, who has worked with artists such as Linkin Park and Eve 6, and lends a heavy rock sound to these four songs.  &quot;Together&quot; features some of the strongest verses but the production on the chorus sounds cheap and abrasive at some points.  &quot;Nobody's Home&quot; is a good song lyrically about a girl who feels alone and trapped, and Avril's vocals shine here, and &quot;Forgotten&quot; is a stand-out track in terms of style as it channels gothic proportions - but isn't necessairly one of my faves.<br />&quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; (Avrils first single, comparable to &quot;Complicated&quot; off of her first album), &quot;My Happy Ending&quot; (Her second single), and &quot;Freak Out&quot; exemplify another style, namely poppy, and probably are due to the influence of producer Butch Walker, of the late 90's band &quot;Marvelous 3&quot;.  If you haven't heard Avril's first two singles both are really awesome, &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; has a good girl power message and nice production with pianos and guitars, and &quot;My Happy Ending&quot; is a really sweet heartbreak song, with an awesome hook and the video is also really good.  &quot;Freak Out&quot; is just a good sing-along anthem in general.<br />Finally one must draw attention to the power couple of Canadian music that has heavy influence on Lavigne throughout.  Chantal Kreviazuk, Avrils &quot;new best friend&quot;, hails from my city and is best known in Canada for her cover of &quot;Leaving on a Jet Plane&quot; or one of her many hits including &quot;Now I Think I'll Get Through&quot;. Chantal co-writes half of the albums tracks, as well as injects a bit of her style with the lush layered vocals, poetic lyrics, and folky-guitars on some of the mellower tracks. Chantal's husband Raine Maida plays double duty as producer and co-writes one of the tracks (one of my personal faves lyrically) &quot;Fall To Pieces&quot;.  Maida is best known for his stint as the frontman of the super popular Canadian rock group Our Lady Peace, and lends some of his style (vocally and production-wise) to the rest of the tracks on the album.  These include the pop-punk &quot;He Wasn't&quot; (similar to &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot;), the super mellow &quot;How Does It Feel&quot;, the rock-pop anthem &quot;Who Knows&quot;, and the closing track dedicated to Lavigne's grandpa who died while she was on tour.  &quot;Slipped Away&quot; is again one of the best tracks to show off Avrils vocals particularly during the raw piano accompanied parts, and is a touching end to a solid album.<br />Altogether Avril fans new and previous, young and old, will be satisfied with this 12 song offering that explores new territory for the young singer - musically, vocally, and lyrically.  She mixes styles based on production (harder rock, pop, and a folk-rock vibe) and proves that she deserves to be in the spotlight as a still-rising singer/songwriter.
B000059XXZ|3.0|jack nicholson set a world record for accepting 89 million bones to play the joker here.i didnt like the fact that the joker got wasted since he was easily the best character in thefilm.also,although i think tim burton is a directing genius,in this film he focused way too much on character development and the beautiful gothic arcitecture of gotham and really had little left for the actual storyline.michael keaton is batman.children will enjoy this one.this is easily the best of the batman onslaught of the 90s.this is a film most anyone will enjoy except people who criticize everything.there is only one really hot babe in this one.her name is vickie.shes one of those stuck up buisness broad by day-raving whore by night types.the only major difference between this movie and the comic book is that the joker is batmans long time arch nemisis not just some fly by night clown who gets wasted in the first episode.jack nicholson played an awesome joker.he deserved an award.people say this movie rocks and THEY ARE RIGHT.
B00006879E|4.0|Maroon 5 is riding high at the moment - with a few hit singles under their belt their album is selling like hotcakes, and rightfully so.  Lead singer Adam Levine proves himself as a songwriter, and vocally with his infectious twang/soul/funk/pop voice.  The band as a whole also creates an impressive layered sound on each track.  Their style can be described as a blend of pop (channeling Justin Timberlake circa *NSYNC on some tracks), reggae, 70's funk, nu-school jazz (a la Jamie Cullum or Michael Buble for example), and some good ol' fashioned rock and roll.  While this intense mix of music leads to a fresh sound in todays bass or scream heavy music - I found a lack of super diversity in style on the album - the guys seem to just lean towards one direction moreso on each individual track, sticking true to a core sound and branching out in one or two directions per song.  Still this is not an album to be easily looked over or passed up as it features some truly awesome tracks and is fun to listen to as your speeding down the highway, relaxing in your room, or playing as background music for gatherings.<br />&quot;Harder To Breathe&quot; is the bands first offering, a short rock-inspired track, very catchy and a good single.  If you haven't heard &quot;This Love&quot; you must be living under a rock, as the album features the version most heard on the radio - and is an awesome pop track with a great riff instrumentally, and an intensely catchy hook for the chorus.  The song that has truly skyrocketed the guys into a new stratosphere of stardom.  &quot;Shiver&quot; exemplifies a bit of Santana-esque guitars, and boy band-esque vocals, particularly during the chorus.  Catchy and fun :)  &quot;She Will Be Loved&quot; is the boys third single and probably the track that really sold me to finally go out and buy the album - after only hearing it once.  A really sweet, mellow, guitar-driven ballad you will find it incredibly infectious, especially when listening to the emotion behind Levines' vocals.<br />&quot;Tangled&quot; shows a bit of that 70's funk sound mentioned earlier, with a good drum beat, but the harmonies remind me a LOT of *NSYNC back in the day.  &quot;The Sun&quot; has got a bit of a funk sound to it, but also a bit of a loungey vibe, I don't think it was a good choice to put right after &quot;Tangled&quot; as they sound kinda similar, but is a decent song regardless.  Bass player Mickey Madden shows patience in the next track, &quot;Must Get Out&quot;, an easy-to-listen to and downright enjoyable song.  I love how simple the verses are.<br />&quot;Sunday Morning&quot; is probably one of my fave songs on the album, showing off that nu-school jazz style that Levine is perfectly capable of (see Jamie Cullum for comparison).  Its just an awesome song all-around and really bright sounding throughout, especially on the chorus.  &quot;Secret&quot; spends the first 45 seconds with a very subtle intro, then centers on very simple acoustic guitars, and is another awesome mellow lounge-pop track.  A nice departure from the sometimes over-enthusiastic production of other tracks.<br />&quot;Through With You&quot; starts off a bit Radiohead-inspired, and is a bit more abstract with a rock vibe.  Feel the beat in this one as it matches up with the vocals almost perfectly - the instrumentals almost outshine here.  &quot;Not Coming Home&quot; has some really awesome funky guitar bits to it and is performed live - which is ridiculous as it sounds liek there have been about 100 studio takes to put a track like this together, however if its an indication of their talent then these boys are amazing.  &quot;Sweetest Goodbye&quot; is a bit pop, a bit soul, and a very simple exit to the album - not a particular standout but a nice finish to the disc.<br />Altogether if you are looking for a new sound to add your collection guaranteed Maroon 5 won't sound like anything else you have (although it might borrow sounds here and there).  A solid effort inspired by Levine's supposed muse 'Jane', which I've theorized might also be a moniker for the female population as a whole (IE: Jane Doe) saying that the trials Levine writes about in each track aren't inspired by one girl, but many.  Either way give these guys a listen!
B00005RJ1U|3.0|this has all the ingreients of a low budget horror film.there are dumb kids,a mysterious monster that wont die,hick cops,unanswered questions,rednecks who stare when hysterical girls scream in terror,old crazy chicks with cats,a seer........you get the idea.low budget =not enough cash to hire a real star.this film will scar youre kids for life.dont let them watch it!they made a really crappy sequel,but this ones good.most people will like it once.if you like the type of movie,its good again and again.there are a few nasty parts but they are quick not to terribly awful.the chicks are all toothless and clueless rednecks and none of them get naked.it is better than the reviews and you should see it.since part 2 sucks so bad i hope a 3 never-AND I MEAN EVER-surfaces.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I can understand why some people do not like this movie, and I was even hesitant to write this review because I can't stand it when people jump on the \\"artsy\\" bandwagon.  However, even though I have never been one of those people who will run out to see a movie because all the \\"elites\\" are praising it, I must say that I honestly enjoyed this movie.  <br />That said, you will not enjoy this movie if plot is very important to you.  For me, plot is not of central importance to me; character is the most important aspect of any movie or work of literature.  I love movies where there is a special connection formed among strangers, and this one fits the Bill (pun intended).  Viewers are able to sense the loneliness of each of the main characters without it being rammed down our throats.  You have two people who are in lackluster relationships (both married) and are in a foreign land.  The thing about being in a foreign land is that you are somewhat freed of the role you must assume in your \\"regular\\" life.  You can reveal parts of yourself that would normally remain dormant.   The two main characters are able to reveal themselves in unique ways to each other and to form a special bond that they have not formed with their own spouses.<br />[BEWARE:  Slight spoiler] The thing that I really loved about this movie is the fact that the protagonists do not sleep together.  It is so rare that Hollywood decides to leave out the gratuitous sex and focus on the other aspects of relationships.<br />I must admit that I'm not too fond of mysterious endings, and for me, that did detract from the movie a bit.  However, I would still highly recommend it.
B000062YAZ|4.0|In 1986 this was as extreme as music got. While the lyrics could still be interpreted as 'scary' or 'satanic' by the average grandmother, thanks to people like Cannibal Corpse and Necro you probably wont be very shocked hearing this album in 2004 rather than 1986. Produced by Rick Rubin, who was certainly taking some risks, seeing as his other production included the Beastie Boy and Public Enemy, who aren't very much like Slayer or the music they make. All it took was 28 minutes to cement this album to a permenent posistion on the Greatest Thrash Albums list. <BR>Starting the album is Angel of Death, considered by many to be the greatest song Slayer has written. Upon first hearing it, I was a bit baffled by the lyrics. Lyrics about Nazi concentration camps and 'destroying without mercy to benefit the Aryan race' seemed a little weird coming from Tom Araya, who is clearly from a non-Aryan background. However, I discovered later that all most all the lyrics and music on this album were written solely by Kerry King, with Dave Lombardo and Tom contributing no writing to the album. <BR>The next eight songs are typical Slayer. Blazing guitar solos, Tom's often un-understandible lyrics and autopilot bass, awesome drum playing from Lombardo, and usually over in less than three minutes. The album closer, Raining Blood, is more or less the same 'ol Slayer, but creates a different mood, with the song begining and ending with the sounds of thunder and rain. <BR>Remembering all the stories you heard about Slayer being satanists and racist and pushing teenagers to suicide may falsly prepare you for something you wont hear in this record. <BR>Its still loud, it's fast, it's brutal, but unlike in 1986, it's no longer shocking in 2004.
B0001AVZA8|2.0|That's what the writers, directors, producers, etc. of this movie must think.   They expect us to actually believe that a leering old coot like Nicholson would hold some sort of appeal to the character who plays Diane Keaton's daughter.  I know lots of younger women would have gone out with him, but only those who are interested in his money (&amp; presumably, that's not the reason for Keaton's daughter's attraction to him).  Even the attraction of Keanu Reeves's character to Keaton's is unreal.  Spare me the diatribe about her being accomplished, intelligent, blah, blah, blah.  It just ain't happenin' in real life.<br />It was cliché (in a \\"PC\\" sort of way), predictable, and preposterous.  While it wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen, it was definitely a waste of time.

B00009YNGA|5.0|Don't get the normal version of Britney which doesn't has the 3 bonus tracks... BUY THIS ONE! It's only $18 which is..what? The price of any normal regular CD?<br />The 3 bonus songs are great...truly some of the best of Brit's career. It's a shame these weren't on the original edition of &quot;Britney&quot; ... but if you're thinking about buying this version of the album, DO IT! You won't regret it.<br />Before The Goodbye, I Run Away, and When I Found You are great tracks and some of Brit's best. This is such a good deal!
0142000663|5.0|This novel takes place during the &quot;Great Depression&quot; and gives a general view of the 1930's, but also follows the Joad family as they endure many struggles on their way to find work in California. Like thousands of other families, they encounter hunger, violence, and despair during these troubled years of our history. This was kind of a difficult book to get through, but if you want to learn about the affect the &quot;Great Depression&quot; had on everyday families and the struggles they encountered during this time, then you have found the right book
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I remember hearing about this show and seeing few advertisments when it was first broadcasted on Fox, I perked my interest but I missed the shows due to having to work and such.  And then It disappeared from existence never to be heard from again, until now.  A fellow cashier bought it and told me it was awesome and since I like some Science Fiction shows, I thought maybe I should...and I did.  This is one of the best scifi shows ever created.  What it is is a science fiction western in space.  There are no alien races or anything, it's just human who teraformed various planets to inhabit themselves and they colonized out there (ie: the wild west in space).<br />It's really creative and has some very interesting characters.  Like the captain who has personal issues, his first woman who always follows orders, her husband who's a wimpy funny guy, and the very attractive &quot;space hooker.&quot;  There's others and things get really complicated when they pick up a doctor and his sister who are wanted by the Alliance (the typical corrupt gov't power).<br />If you like science fiction, westerns, and some comedy...you need to get this.  Lets hope the movie (&quot;Serenity&quot;) does excellent and is able to revive this show.  Or maybe the sci fi channel will pick it up, after all, they made Stargate Sg-1 one of the most famous scifi shows ever...after FOX dropped the ball.  They do that a lot it seems...
B00005JKN9|2.0|Gangs of New York would have made a great 90 minute movie, but runs almost an hour and a half longer. An impressive fight scene near the start and a satisfactory one at the end cannot really compensate for the tedious dialogue and unconvincing meandering subplots. <br />Daniel Day-Lewis certainly steals what there is of the show with a compelling (if somewhat campy - check out that boo-hiss moustache!) depiction of Bill Cutter - the brutal bigoted leader of the &quot;Native American&quot; gang. <br />Leonardo Di Caprio though, horribly miscast as the orphaned &quot;Amsterdam&quot;, leader of the &quot;Dead Rabbits&quot; generates about as much menace as Bambi, as he seeks revenge for the killing in a gang fight of his &quot;da&quot;.<br />The love interest, provided by Cameron Diaz, as a rather stereotypical tart-with-a-heart (groan), simply doesn't convince or engage the viewer, who will probably be incongruously rooting for Day-Lewis by the end.<br />Despite the aforementioned fights, and a couple of other semi-memorable scenes (DDL's knife-throwing was quite entertaining!) I cannot recall another movie where so little of interest occurs in almost 3 hours.<br />Very disappointing, but could still be salvaged with some intelligent cutting. <br />At least the DVD makes it easy for you to skip the tedious scenes, but I doubt if GONY will be worth repeat viewings.<br />Shame. An opportunity lost.
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|I heard this at work a bunch of times.  It is really good and rocking.  And its new and mainstream.  Good and rocking haven't gone together with new and mainstream for ages...but now it does and can and will.  I really want to buy this album.  It rocks you gently.  If you like this, check out some Joy Division.

0393317552|5.0|Because a new crop of bushy tailed Ivy League students are sure to be required to pick up a copy of this book before their orientations, before even being allowed on campus, there are a few things that you should know about this book before you do start.<br /><br />Even though there are plenty of wild pigs in New Guinea, which could have been domesticated at any time during the last 100,000 years, Jared Diamond describes the natural fauna in New Guinea as if it were the most protein deficient wasteland on earth.  No protein, hmmmm, what could this mean?  Why, those poor people!<br /><br />And even though you would think that this work might lose all credibility if when discussing human cultures, he were to leave out such a grossly significant fact, as the observation that the rugged terrain of the thousands of square miles of the New Guinea highlands is most well known, among educated people, as the home of a people that have been nothing for thousands of years but stone age men without a written language, or any metal tools, but with a human bone or a nasal shell through their septum because they are the world's most feared cannibals.<br /><br />Yet not one word will you find in this book about that, but with a subtle nod of Jared's head for those in the know, wink wink, that oh, their natural diet has no protein.  So, of course, the same trade routes and tasty plants that led other peoples to great things, through no fault or effort of their own, left these poor people in New Guinea very hungry.  Very hungry for protein!<br /><br />You will kill anyone who disagrees with you, by the end of this great work, about the fact that all cultures just have different ways of solving the same universal problems, like protein deficiency for example.  And that socialism and capitalism and communism and cannibalism are all just different ways of accomplishing the very same things.  Except for capitalism, of course, which is grossly unfair to the poor and to be despised!<br /><br />You will always have a warm feeling in your stomach, as well, at the secret thoughts that you will imagine that you only realize to yourself after reading this book, about how white boys aren't really anything special after all, despite what you had previously been tricked into believing, in how they just happened to find themselves on east west trade routes near plants that just happened to contain protein.<br /><br />Of course, you will find many other new ideas in this book, such as Jared Diamond's suggestion in the introduction, that Western civilization encourages white boys to pass on their genes, no matter how intellectually deficient they might be, because Western civilization makes so few demands upon its citizens.  Which is why you must be given this book to read even before your orientation, while you are still unlearned enough to not even know about the famous cowry shell collecting New Guinea cannibals.in your stomach, as well, at the secret thoughts that you will imagine that you only realize to yourself after reading this book, about how white boys aren't really anything special after all, despite what you had previously been tricked into believing, in how they just happened to find themselves on east west trade routes near plants that just happened to contain protein.

B0000C6E4D|5.0|Sarah McLachlan's new work &quot;afterglow,&quot; seems to be her best work yet. This album is much calmer and more piano focused than the others, which offers a new sense of calm. I am a huge fan of this artist, and also had the pleasure to see her concert a few nights ago in Portland. If you are a Sarah fan, it is worth the ticket price to see... she was absolutely amazing. She offered two encores and made the atmosphere very personal. She cares about people and that definetly comes across. She is absolutly worth it!

B0001Z52RU|5.0|The Director's Cut restores the superior, darker original ending, replacing the feel-good Hollywood ending imposed by the studio, which is completely out of step with the rest of the movie. Very intense movie, with a lot of shocking events--none of which you actually see, but in Hitchock style, you feel as if you had. A very well constructed time travel story with a fairly unique premise. Great performances by the cast (including a surprisingly deep performance by Kutchner), who have to carry off various alternate history versions of their characters. Also powerful performances by the four child actors who play the younger versions of the major characters.

B000002J09|5.0|Short review: Awesome album<br />Other stuff: OK, now the REAL reason why I reviewed this album again. To that dumbass avril lavine fan, WTF? Jimmy Page is the best guitarist ever! And Malmsteen, Van Halen, and Hendrix are also some of the top 10 best guitarists ever! And WTF, avril doesn't do solos(yes just know)! And she doesn't do punk, she just does boring crappy pop! REAL punk is bands like The Misfits, The Clash, Sex Pistols, The Ramones, Bad Religion, Dead Kennedys, Minor Threat, Dropkick Murphys, NoFX, etc.,etc.,etc.,etc. And all those bands you told \\"to go away\\" are awesome, dumbass!!!!! Another thing, she ain't even a good guitarist!!!!!<br />Bottom line, this is goin to you:<br />[censored] (- -) [censored]<br />(the censor bars are covering the middle fingers)<br />Glad I got that outta my system...

B00013F38K|5.0|Kung Fu is simply one of the most engrossing, innovative sagas of all-time. It is parlously dubious that another of its kind will ever emerge, and that is predominantly due to the fact that David Carradine's role as Caine is unmatched and unparalleled. Many would assert and contend that Bruce Lee (who the role was intended for) would have best suited the role, but those appeals would be futile. <br />As a viewer you cannot help but to be assiduously involved with Caine emotionally, and that is a testament to his character's efficacy. In addendum to the DVD are special behind-the-scenes look at how each show was conceived from start to finish, and various issues the crew dealt with because such a series which included so much violence had never been aired (Implausible now, considering the amount of violence which is accepted as appropriate today). Implementation of the slow-motion action sequences seen throughout the series was the director's unpretentious method of mitigating the violence. <br />This season set also includes the pilot movie (in its entirety) which propelled the saga off to its numerous consummations. For any individual interested in an admirable and awe-inspiring series, or just looking to reminisce on an adroitly exceptional actor and saga-- Kung Fu: The Complete First Season will most certainly suffice and in most cases, exceed your expectations.
B0001E7LQG|5.0|I disagree with many of the other reviews because I thought this movie was great. It is so refreshing to have a romantic comedy for the Baby Boom demographic. And it is doubly refreshing to see a Hollywood film with a 57 year old actress in the lead. Diane Keaton is marvelous in this film. Her performance is the primary reason I feel such affection for the movie. She is a wonderful actress and makes the movie special.
B000268QB2|4.0|You can argue all day about who Keane sounds like, but at the end of the day it's easiest to just listen to their songs and judge for yourself. I first heard Keane by watching a broadcast of their performance at this year's Glastonbury Festival on BBC 1. I was impressed by the strong, clear vocals over smooth yet upbeat melodies and quickly picked up their cd. My personal favorites are 'This Is The Last Time' and 'Everybody's Changing'. Overall, it's a good cd, but it's not out to change the world.

B00009Y3R6|5.0|Set in Australia's bleak outback, this 2002 film takes place in 1931, when white bureaucrats forced their own morality on aboriginal half-castes living in the bush.  Believing that these half-white children &quot;deserved&quot; the &quot;advantages&quot; of &quot;civilization,&quot; and convinced that in three generations their blackness could be &quot;bred out,&quot; the Australian government forcibly removed them from their families, brought them to settlements hundreds of miles from their homes, and trained them to be domestic servants.  Forty years later the government finally abandoned the policy, leaving a &quot;Stolen Generation&quot; in its wake.  Molly Craig has long been the symbol of the Aborigines' refusal to accept this genocidal policy, and this film, brilliantly directed by Philip Noyce, celebrates her unconquerable spirit in the face of sanctioned governmental cruelty.<br />Molly Craig (Everlyn Sampi), her cousin Gracie (Laura Monaghan), and her sister (Tianna Sansbury), aged thirteen to eight, are cruelly removed from their mothers in Jigalong (Western Territories) and taken a thousand miles to the Moore River Native Settlement, which is directed by the self-righteous Mr. Neville (convincingly played by Kenneth Branagh), who believes in the inherent correctness of the resettlement policy.  Placed in overcrowded dormitories, prohibited from using their own language, and required to live according to another world's rules, Molly, her sister, and her cousin decide to escape by following the 1500-mile &quot;rabbit-proof fence,&quot; which borders both the settlement and their distant home.  They must avoid detection by a hired Aborigine tracker (played menacingly by David Gulpilil) and by government workers and white settlers.  For nine grueling weeks, the girls live virtually on their own, surviving through their ancestral knowledge of the land.<br />Written by Molly Craig's daughter, Doris Pilkington Garimara, who, later, was also removed from her mother Molly and forced to live in a settlement, the film is a moving celebration of the human spirit, a tribute to Molly Craig, and a plea to acknowledge the rights of aboriginal peoples, wherever they may live.  The harsh and unforgiving land is beautifully photographed, and the haunting music of aboriginal voices and instruments in the Golden Globe-nominated score by Peter Gabriel further the realism.  The cast of young girls, all making their film debuts, never makes a misstep, conveying the trauma of their separation, their commitment to returning home, and, in Sampi's case, an anger which is only barely hidden.  Branagh, though effective, really does not have to do much to be the villain here.  In this beautifully realized depiction of a wrong-headed policy, director Noyce wisely chooses not to embellish the message with unnecessary, artificial melodrama--reality here is drama enough.

0385336810|5.0|This is one of the best books for a fun summer read.  The main character, Emma Corrigan, works in an advertising office.  She is trying to get ahead.  Trying to make a career for herself, mostly to impress her parents (whom only seem to be interested in her super successful cousin) when she has a life changing flight from Scotland.  She is petrified of flying and on the rough flight home she freaks out and tells a total stranger, sitting next to her, all of her deepest secrets.  This stranger turns out to be the CEO of the company she works at.  This is a wonderful story that should be on every chick-lit reading list for the summer.

I don't like their early songs, listen to PF from Meddle.<BR>The main reason I gave this album only 1 star is that there is a much better compilation out there: Roger Water's In The Flesh.<BR>Far better than this one, believe me. Get THAT one and save your money.

WHAT A SHAME AS IT IS A STRONGER RECORDING. WHEN I FIRST SAW BLONDIE PERFORM &quot;DREAMING&quot; I LOST IT. THEN TO MY AMAZEMENT EVERY SONG IS UNIQUE.

B0002234LS|4.0|Given the fact that the majority of Stephen King's movies are some of the worst films to ever grace the big screen, I wasn't expecting &quot;Secret Window&quot; to be much more than a mockery of the novella that it was based upon. Fortunately, I was pleasantly surprised. Depp's acting was superb, as always, the plot was intriguing, and although predictable and slow at times, still kept my utmost attention. The only complaint I have of &quot;Secret Window&quot; is that it was too formulaic and predictable and I felt that the last 20 minutes of the movie in which Depp's character is finally exposed in all his glorious madness clashes with how he portrayed his character up to that point, making what should have been sinister seem more comical; after seeing Depp in those black rimmed glasses and puppy dog like and timid in those ragged clothing it was difficult to suspend my disbelief long enough to take him seriously as a psychotic murderer, although, his acting was still, as ever, laudable.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Like the title of this review suggests, this is a great album. But if I could I would have given this album 4.5 stars because although it's great, it's not perfect but I opted to give it 5 because it's closer to that than a 4. Anyways, on to the review.<br />     Most, if not all, of the songs on this album have extremely catchy verses and choruses which is what pulls you into the music and makes this a very easily accessible album. Unlike albums from the likes of Pink Floyd, Porcupine Tree, and Modest Mouse whose songs take a few listens to finally get into, you can just pick up this album, pop it in, and immediately start enjoying it. Every song on this album has potential radio stardom written all over it with the exception of the somewhat slow ones (&quot;Nobody's Home&quot; and &quot;Slipped Away&quot;) which is understandable since slow songs have never really been a friend to radio. I just have to mention how she adds violins, pianos and the like to songs such as &quot;How Does It Feel&quot;, &quot;Together&quot;, and &quot;Slipped Away&quot; which a lot of bands nowadays seem to be doing but I applaud her for her thoughtful songwriting. The addition of those instruments really add depth to the songs and fit them surprisingly well. Though all the songs are incredibly catchy, there's one song that stands up above the rest because it goes to a lot more places than any of the other songs - &quot;He Wasn't&quot;.<BR> <BR>     Now for my only gripes with this album. The first thing that disappointed me is something that seems to be plaguing every modern punk rock/pop rock band which is lyrical quality. All the songs, with the exception of a couple, are in one form or another about guys. Sure, the 60's/70's had a lot of songs about girls and being in love but at least they made the lyrics interesting. &quot;Trampled Under Foot&quot; or &quot;Here, There And Everywhere&quot;, anyone? It really makes me realize how much I miss songs like &quot;Across The Universe&quot;, &quot;The Battle Of Evermore&quot;, &quot;Pigs (Three Different Ones)&quot;, &quot;My Wife&quot;, and &quot;Can't Get It Out Of My Head&quot; that had interesting and thought-provoking lyrics. My only other gripe with this album and again, it's another one that plagues every modern band, is that there's no experimentation. I've probably been spoiled by listening to a lot of music from the 60's and 70's but what happened to bands like Led Zeppelin and The Beatles who, while staying mainly a rock band, ventured into folk, funk, reggae, and Middle Eastern tinged songs. But if you're a fan of modern music opposed to older music then you probably don't have these small problems that I thought I'd point out. They're really nothing big and they certainly don't detract from listening to the album. I guess it's like Bob Dylan said, &quot;The times they are a-changin'.&quot;
B000294SFW|4.0|There are certain bands in Rock 'N' Roll that overstay their welcome. One of the bands who haven't, however, is Motorhead, who are back with their twenty-third long player. Then again, when you have God as your Bass-whipping frontman, maybe this band is eternal. After all, has there ever been a band cited as influences for so many other bands? Probably not, and no doubt this effort should influence many more. And having been categorized in just about every genre of Rock 'N' Roll, this, as is every other Motorhead effort, is nothing more than good old R 'N' R turned up to eleven. From the opener, \\"Terminal Show\\", Lemmy and the boys proceed to rattle the teeth of the listener, with some of 2004's crunchiest riffs and razor-sharp vocals. Next up is \\"Killers\\", which continues the album's theme of beating the listener into submission. On \\"Life's A Bitch\\", the guys continue the assault, with what could be dubbed  the sequel to \\"Eat The Rich\\", as Lemmy sings at the end, \\"Fear the sky, eat the rich. Just remember life's a bitch\\". On \\"Down On Me\\", the bottom-end crunch is heavier than anything else on the disc, with the band's tone and Lemmy's voice melding perfectly in ear-splitting fashion. On \\"Fight\\", Lemmy urges the listener to \\"put the bass up\\", before erupting into a rapid-fire riff. Finally, the band closes with \\"Whorehouse Blues\\", and while this is an acoustic diddy, it still manages to pull off the toughness as on all the other tracks, and who knew that Lemmy could play harmonica? Lemmy is accompanied on this effort by Guitarist Philip Campbell and Drummer Mikkey Dee, who are quite adept at keeping up with the pace of these breakneck messages from the true God of Rock 'N' Roll. As Lemmy says in the album liner notes, this is a \\"Jolly bloody good show\\", and as with every one of the albums, the listener is urged to take caution before unleashing this onto one's stereo. Nope, nothing new here, just your average little Motorhead album. And with Motorhead average is a hell of a lot better than most.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I must admit that if it weren't for my friends, I probably would have never even given this title a second look, but after I watched it, I was amazed. Miyazaki has managed to create one of the most beautiful, not to mention entertaining, movies I have ever seen. The characters (especially Chihiro) are very true to life. I highly recommend &quot;Spirited Away&quot; even if you aren't an anime fan or, like me, are an otaku (you know who you are). I also encourage you to check out Miyazaki's other works, two of my favorites being &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot; and &quot;The Castle of Cagliostro.&quot;

B00014K5TQ|3.0|To be honest, I watched this movie for one reason: Seth Green. However, I found the movie quite enjoyable. Not a perfect film--Chloë Sevigny's and Dylan McDermott's characters felt underdeveloped to me and some of the character intrusion and narration seemed unnecessary--but a fascinating, entertaining and funny movie, nonetheless.<br />Seth Green did not disappoint me. His portrayal of James St. James is excellent and his passion and devotion to the role apparent. I am undecided about Culkin's performance. Michael seems shallow to me, but that is actually appropriate to the role, as Michael Alig seems void of humanity in the interviews I have watched. Culkin's Alig seems a mere poseur to Green's St. James, who lives and breathes fabulousness. But again, that aspect could also be essential to Michael's character who seemed to be a club kid just because it would lead to attention. Mostly, though, I was wishing that Kieran was on the screen instead. Chloë Sevigny is underused in her role of Michael's girlfriend and I could have done with seeing more interaction between Michael and Angel. And some boy-on-boy intimacy. The directors were willing to show such outrageous costumes, copious amounts of drug use, and yet no affection between men despite the heavy homoerotic overtones between the actors. The lack of homosexual interaction wouldn't bother me as much if Michael and his girlfriend weren't shown in intimate moments as well.<br />This DVD is a pretty good disc. The print of the film is good, capturing the brightness of the costumes and parties and the changing color tone of the movie. The special features are decent. The commentary is pretty heavy with historical information about the accuracy of the events, but the directors share information about the production as well, usually concerning how disgusting the location smelled. I would have preferred more of the latter, but that is just my preference. The featurette was interesting, but the behind the scenes footage was rather dull for the most part. I appreciated having the interview with Michael Alig on the disc and an interview with James St. James would have been a welcome edition. <br />All in all, the movie is interesting to watch and the disc is worth the purchase.

So, we've spent much money on guides, books, videos, stories, etc.  This book (and the video) have made a major break through.  My daughter loves the story of Prudence and her potty!  With her plethora of videos, she chooses this one to view, and wants to sit on the potty while watching it!  Last night (which is why I decided to write a review), my daughter asked to use the potty, and she proceeded to poo.  When she was all done, she proudly stood up and announced that she pooped on the potty just like Prudence! Finally we've made a connection!!

B0002858YS|4.0|On their new album, The Killers put out a great album filled with 80's influences. From David Bowie to Duran Duran and Depeche Mode, The Killers blend all of their influences with just the lighest sprinkle of indie-pop the make one of the freshest sounding albums of the year. Full of synth-laden hooks and pulsing dance beats, the album breathes like no other current CD. There's feel good songs like the current single, \\"Somebody Told Me,\\" as well as displays of real songwriting in \\"Mr. Brightside\\" and \\"All These Things That I've Done.\\" The album does have some slower-moving parts, such as \\"Andy You're a Star\\" and \\"Indie Rock and Roll,\\" but they don't seem to bog down the flow of the album too much. The production quality is great, with open guitars, slamming drums, and echoey vocals. Its something you'd expect from the British underground music scene, not the Las Vegas desert. However, when The Killers come out to play, they won't leave anyone alive.

B00005JN0A|3.0|&quot;Eurotrip&quot; is simply a re-hash of the teen &quot;gross out&quot; comedies popular in the last five or so years. It takes little pieces of movies such as &quot;American Pie,&quot; &quot;Road Trip,&quot; and &quot;Old School,&quot; then ties it all together with a new storyline. While I admit the movie has its hilarious moments, its simply more of the same. The downright repetitiveness from past films is somewhat annoying, and the acting, having a relativley undiscovered cast, is pretty weak. On a more positive note, the DVD's production quality seems good, and will make for a quick burst of entertainment. It's been done before, but its still worth a rent at Blockbuster just to have some laughs.

B00005JMJ4|4.0|While it was nominated for many Academy Awards, and won one, &quot;Lost In Translation&quot; can be a very confusing movie. If you are a simple &quot;Meat &amp; Potatoes&quot; kind of movie-goer, this probably isn't the film for you. However, if you can &quot;get&quot; the movie, it is an amazing cinematic experience. I believe the main key to this film's success is being shot on location in Tokyo. Had it been shot in a studio with some backdrops or post-production CG, it wouldn't have been nearly as good. The camera exposes Tokyo's foreign beauty and mystery all wrapped up in one. On the note of camera, the story of &quot;Lost In Translation&quot; isn't so much told by the character's dialogue - - in fact, there is very little dialogue at all. Rather, it is told via the camera, and I think this is where alot of people get lost (no pun intended). People are looking for some kind of solid story in the script between Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray, but it just doesn't happen. You need to look at how the camera is used during a scene, and what it exposes to you, that will make you enjoy the film. I will admit it's kind of an &quot;artsy&quot; movie, but thats what makes it so good. It makes a statement without coming out and blasting it over the screen. It makes you take a hard look at the film to try and understand it. It makes you pay attention to more than just dialogue to understand the story. And therein lies the beauty of &quot;Lost In Translation.&quot; Approach the movie with an open, yet critical mind, and you'll reap all the benefits of this great film.
B0001MDP3G|3.0|I was not very impressed with this film and it is certainly not one of my favorites for the year.  The acting was fine,although it was a bit strange to see Kidman in make-up that rivaled what she ordinarily wears for an award ceremony.  The music was great and the period pieces were a highlight of the movie.  One very unpleasant part of the film was that the majority of the characters seemed to be sociopathic, bloodthirsty, and crude.  The film also tries a little too hard to be &quot;EPIC&quot; and barely achieves satisfying.  The cimematography is excellent and the scenery breathtaking.  Overall, good but not great.  Just too heavy-handed, overblown, and signifying little.
B000092ZYX|5.0|I have always enjoyed any album from Radiohead, but by far this is my favorite so far. Can be &quot;gloomy&quot;, but I love a good gloomy album. The albums flows well, excellently blended along with great lyrics. I find that I could listen to this over and over again. If I had to cut my CD collection this would be a CD that would make it high on the list.
B00005OM4Q|5.0|...beautiful film with an awesome soundtrack. It draws you in and makes you forget who and where you are. Fans will enjoy the extras scenes, commentaries and behind the scenes info on this long version. The &quot;bootleg&quot; look and style of this edition are great fun too.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|One of the best movies I have seen in a very long time.<BR>It shows the mundaneness that so many marriages expereince and the isolation that can occur when a relationship is not what you had expected.<BR>The picture captures a glimpse into the interaction of two people alone and how they wished things could be different and exciting, but life just isn't that way.<BR>The movie isn't for eveyone. If you don't want to think.. rent, then buy.
B0001HAHXW|1.0|i think clapton should make a blues album with his own song so far he has 2 blues albums with song done by other people. They're Red Hot is an annoying song he sing the chrous over and over. there are much better blues albums. don't waist your money burn it from someone  because its worth the price of a blank cd thats about it
B00006DEFA|5.0|I loved &quot;Amadeus&quot; the first time I saw it and every time thereafter, on tape, DVD and now in this DVD package. It is a very great film, exceptionally worthy of its Oscars, and the role of a lifetime for Tom Hulse. The operatic and musical scenes in this film succeed on a scale never seen before. The finale of &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; is better in this movie than in the two live performances I've seen and the performance Herbert von Karajan led that was shown on PBS in 1990. The direction, acting, script and locations are all sumptuous. It apparently does not follow the play on which it is based, but artistic difference is the basis of enjoyment. Having said all this, I would caution viewers not to judge the real-life Mozart by the portrayal of Hulse in this film. The real Mozart, I have read, was a prudish workaholic that would never go out drinking with his buddies. He also played by the rules of the day and adored Salieri, respecting his role as the musical director in Vienna. Still, it's fair to set history aside in a work of art this fine. Anyone that likes great music or great movies will enjoy this.

0440237688|5.0|Kiddoes, I just finished rereading this book for about the eighth time, but I'll try to transport my mind back in time to when I first read it. I think you'll get a better perspective that way.<br />It's about a society that wants to be 'perfect'. Well, actually, 'perfect' wouldn't be the best word. I suppose that they want everything to be structured and uniform. They call it in the book 'Sameness'. <br />There are books and movies about futures that stink, but, let me tell you, this is an especially insane one. <br />The land is climate-controlled, and completely the same. Flat; no hills, no valleys. No colors, even. And it isn't just the outside that's controlled... The people don't love, aren't sad or guilty... basically, they don't feel human emotions. Only the Receiver is allowed to experience those things, and he is the keeper for the entire community... without him, the memories would be unleashed and the community would revert to chaos.<br />People have their jobs chosen for them, their mates chosen, even their children. You get to old? You're 'released'. (Releasing is killing, if you haven't figured that out.) A twin, and smaller than your brother or sister? You're released. Make a mistake, like flying in the wrong direction? Released. It's scary about what you can't do...<br />Jonas is chosen as the new Receiver, and (surprise) he's the character that the book centers around. We read about his life before he is selected, during, and afterwards, and I don't know about you, but it was a major shock to me that there wasn't color. <br />I'm not sure if I can say that I LOVED this book. Loving would imply that I loved the concepts, and also would imply that I wasn't horrified while I was reading it. Happy little kiddoes in America aren't really exposed to this kind of stuff... not even CLOSE to it. <br />But I really respect it, and totally understand why it's a classic. Lois Lowry got a fan with this book; Number the Stars didn't quite do it for me. <br />Andanother thing I think people need to understand about this book is that even though the text is simple and that youngsters can READ it, the concepts are meant for older kids.
B000002C25|5.0|Critics suck. This album is better than people give say it is. It may not be their best work, but to anyone with any clue on what good music is should know this cd is a great one. I am a huge oasis fan and own every cd they have. I like every song they have ever written and the B-sides like Lets all belive are great. This album has what most bands dont have anymore, a guitar playing well and loud. The song I hope, I think, I know is one of the greatest songs they have written so i dont know why i hear people badmouthing this album. If i were start over and buy thier albums, this would be number 2 right after Their first one becuase that is my facorite one.
0446677450|1.0|Kiyosaki says he made a lot of money in real estate. Apparently this is not true. He has made the bulk of his money selling his books and giving motivational speeches. His first book became a best seller only when the Amway corporation recommended it to its distributers. <BR>Rich Dad Poor Dad led me into the multi-level marketing nightmare. Fortunately, I didn't stay in very long, but I would never have gotten involved in the first place if I hadn't been looking for a way to get my 'money to work for me', instead of 'working for money'.<BR>It also turns out that the successful people in Quixtar (formerly Amway) apparently make most of their money on the motivational tapes and rallys that they 'recommend strongly' to their 'Independent Business Owners' (IBOs).<BR>So, it's a vicious circle. I got involved in Quixtar because of Kiyosaki's book, which claimed that you need to develop a residual income in order get rich (or even survive financially). The leading IBOs in Quixtar make most of their money on motivational tapes and rallys (although this is not what they tell you in their tapes and rallys). It turns out that Kiyosaki has made most of his money from his books and speeches (although this is not what he tells you in his books and speeches), and it also turns out that Kiyosaki's first book became successful only after Amway recommended it to its distributers. I'm not saying that 'Rich Dad Poor Dad' is devoid of any value, but if you buy this book, please read it with care - and realize that not everything Kiyosaki says is true. I am not happy that I bought this book and contributed further to Kiyosaki's misleading wealth. I feel like a big fool - like I walked straight into a trap!
B000267JQK|1.0|I hate when bands do this.  I bought Disclaimer shortly after it came out a couple of years back, and found Seether to be one of the best new rock bands I had heard in a long time.  Now, instead of putting together a brand new album, we get a rehashed version with bonus tracks that the purchasers of the original release need to shell out another sixteen bucks to hear.  Note to record companies: this is why people download mp3s.  If a band is going to do this, there should be a way for the owners of the original album to get the extra tracks from the band's website or something.  This is simply a marketing ploy to get people to buy an album twice.
B000000SDN|5.0|It's very good, really. All the voices are excellent, the music is so fantastic. And if you close your eyes you can really imagine Thomas Hampson is an old man - it doesn't matter what age he is supposed to be, he is GOOD!
B0000CEB4V|5.0|Absolutely brilliant.  Clapton, Lynne, Joe Brown, Petty, Ringo and all definately celebrated George's anniversary.  Monty Python was rather cheeky but always is and we wouldn't want him any other way.

0060900075|5.0|It's been a long time since I've touched any illicit drug. I remember in my teens I went through my Rimbaud phase of experimentation to see if I could write poetry under pot. But as with drunkenness, creative writing while you're high has little or no good effect. Often it's not even possible to create in such a state. The notion that you'll get all these visions and reach a higher creative reality is all, unfortunately, bullsh*t. However, in very moderate doses, drugs and alcohol can help stimulate an artist's creativity. <br />&quot;The Doors of Perception&quot; was the result of Aldous Huxley taking an hallucinogenic called mescaline to see what would happen to him. He sat down and closed his eyes, waiting for it to take effect. When he next opened his eyes, his perception of everything was completely altered. Even the flowers in the vase were different. Huxley referred to this mystical experience as a &quot;sacramental vision of reality&quot; and &quot;the miracle, moment by moment, of naked reality.&quot;<br />David Rehak<BR>author of &quot;Love and Madness&quot;
B0002234LS|2.0|The only thing this movie has going for it is Johnny Depp.  Other than Depps performance there was nothing going on that I had not seen before.  The whole thing wreaked of &quot;The Dark Half&quot;.  To further the feeling of that movie they even had Timothy Hutton in it.  The trailers for this made it seem like it was going to be a roller-coaster ride full of chills, spills and screams.  Well, it was none of that.  There was some anxious moments that never turned in to much of anything.  The ending will not surprise or shock you.  The only thing shocking was that I was so excited about this and then let down so horribly.  Had it not been for Johnny Depp this would have been one of the worst movies of all time.  He could make toilet cleaning interesting which in itself would be scarier than this flop.

0553573403|5.0|Better late than never, yes?<br />Say &quot;Yes&quot; and let's move on.<br />I highly respect Martin's skill with defining and separating the individuals within the world. From Sansa Stark's vapid existence of unending weakness to Arya Stark's rebellion against her gender role, to addressing the weaknesses of adhering without question to ethics and the penalties for living without any code at all, Martin has managed to put into words whole perspectives on life without coming across as preachy.<br />That's an accomplishment, and one I am utterly overwhelmed by.<br />This book is both subtle and obvious, depending on where you are in the story and how much one pays attention. There is simply no way for me to cover the story-arc in a quick review, so let me just cut to what you can expect when you read this. I'll put the standard &quot;how I found this&quot; and other stuff after the basics.<br />The World: Martin fills the world in with such a successful air of &quot;You should know this&quot; that you'll think you missed the first book. Okay, *I* thought I missed the first book, and maybe someone else did too. That being said, you get a gradual build-up that fills in details as you go, so each fact is educational (relax, it's still fun) and builds up the surrounding environment.<br />The People: When I saw from the perspective of a character, I received a very clear picture of what they valued and how they would approach things (good characterization). Their observations of events and other people is limited in scope to what they might be expected to understand, but Martin still manages to keep us abreast of what's happening without breaking character, which is talented writing.<br />The Plot: There is one, there's just a ton of sub-plots along the way that change in apparent importance as we learn more. Martin has the ability to make one love or respect a character we hated just fifty pages ago, and he uses it.<br />Battle: There is death aplenty in this book and series, and Martin can sweep away an entire village or a main character at any time. Battle scenes will stay in your head, as Martin is very talented at highlighting certain moments and etching them into memory, chiseling at the imagination with word and phrase. He DOESN'T waste our time with ultra-detailed combat (&quot;Hero parried a blow to his left, pivoting on his right foot to sweep the short-blade of Villian into the MC-1900s power conduit, the blade sliding...&quot; UGH!) because that's not truly engaging and most people who fight don't remember or think about every sword stroke, every move. We tend to remember victory, defeat and the deciding blow. Everything else is decorative, and while he decorates his fights incredibly well (can you tell that this is a key point for me in fantasy writing?) he doesn't bog things down.<br />What this book AIN'T: It's not Robert Jordan's Conan novels, with simple solutions and one hero. It's not blazing action and non-stop machismo with no regard for consequence. It's not easy or clean, and the black/white/good/bad concept just doesn't fit, so Martin doesn't force it. Good people fail or die, bad people win or survive when they shouldn't, and it may frustrate you....<br />But that means you're involved in the story, doesn't it?<br />I picked up this book just a few months ago while searching for something interesting and new to read. I read the first chapter (or prologue, in this case) to determine if I liked it enough to buy it. After ten or so pages, I decided that I wasn't in love with the story, but that the author had managed to capture something with his writing that I wanted to see more of.<br />I was calling it an investment in writing styles.<br />I was haflway through the book when I realized that I was really enjoying the darker edge this story contained. People have complained about this series, and other folks praise it with all thier hearts. I fall most definitely into the &quot;praise&quot; category, but Martin earned that ranking from me.<br />I give it a solid 5 stars because the tale, the total arcing story-line, is interesting to me. The characters are varied and well-separated, each having thier own voice to speak with and their own observations that they make, and Martin is consistent with this.<br />So full regards to the man for writing something so solid. Check out the first book, and if you're not interested in the second (A Clash of Kings) I will personally clean your bathroom for a week.<br />Of course I won't. I can't believe you even considered that.<br />But a great read, and one I highly recommend. Powerful stuff.in earned that ranking from me.<br />I give it a solid 5 stars because the tale, the total arcing story-line, is interesting to me.

B0000UMD00|5.0|I cannot believe it that Pink with this abum won't Overcome the commercial success that tube with Missundaztood, if this album overcomes in everything to the previous one, My favorite songs are Trouble and God Is A DJ and the Third simple I don't almost like (Last To Know), in all ways I find The Disk very Good I hope when it Takes out its 4 Album for sale it Overcomes all that Made with Missundaztood, because pink is a true Girl party.
0553579908|5.0|First, I would like to comment on language. Skip to the asterisks to by-pass a mild rant.<br />Words are used to convey ideas. No word in and of itself is \\"bad\\", and curse words are frequently (and commonly) used to express intensity, disdain, passion, et al. Frankly, anyone who would condemn a story because the language contained within it is living in a fantasy world whose bubble will pop (one can only hope permanently) the first time they bump into something real.<BR>This book, like all the others, contains language that your mommy wouldn't like. People who have grown up don't let this bother them, while others plant their heads under the blanket and hope the boogie knights don't come for 'em.<br />*****<BR>Apologies. On with the review.<br />A Clash of Kings continues the story arc, and now things are picking up speed. The king is dead, as is his Hand (if that confused you at all, read the first book) and now the lands are immolated in a power struggle for the Iron Throne.<br />Yeah.... well, what you can expect from the book:<br />Magic: While it obviously existed in the first book, it wasn't addressed. Martin starts ramping up the power curve here, taking his time and introducing things slowly. Make no mistake, the magic in this world is NOT fluffy and light, but rather dark, mysterious (it's magic, after all) and scary as hell in some places.<BR>It fits very well.<br />Battle: People want power, and when might makes right, people will reach for it when it's available. There's a TON of fighting in this book, and the descriptions are pretty impressive.<br />Death, treachery: This happens when people fight. No war is bloodless, and should never be thought so. Most folks check their honor at the door when it comes to surival. It happens throughout the book.<br />I've read that some people are unhappy with the unpredictability of the story. No, I'm not kidding. For them, I suggest the \\"See Spot Run\\" series, which is nice and controlled, and if they can tear it from the hands of the Language Police they should enjoy it.<br />Martin doesn't spoon-feed plot to us, and fore-shadows with some subtlety, which can leave an inattentive reader behind.<br />I love that. I like reading a book that I can get more out of by re-reading it, and this is that kind of story.<br />If you enjoyed A Game of Thrones, Heir to the Empire and/or 13th Warrior, you'll probably like A Clash of Kings.
B0002BO0AS|3.0|First of all I am an unearth fan, and have been for some time. The reason I gave this album only 3 stars is because this is by no means a perfect album nor an above effort for UNEARTH. After the last ep endless I was expecting something ground breaking but this album left me wanting more. They put the endless track on this album also and in my opinion is still the best track. This band has all the potential in the world and just didn't live up to it on this release. They showed no amount of maturity on The OnComing Storm, except for the instrumential track which kills any momentum the record had created. It was well worth the 9.99 I spent on it, but this album is by no means &quot;the best metal/hardcore record of the year&quot;.
0441172717|2.0|Comparing this 500 page sleeping pill to Lord of the Rings is like comparing a Rolls Royce Phantom II to a 1975 Pinto.  Dune has some good ideas and in some parts the story really pick up, but over all this book is not as interesting, the characters are not as deep, and the writting style not as polished as Tolken's work.<br />Paul Atreides is not as interesting as Frodo, or even Luke Skywalker. Jessica reminds me of Jan Brady or a 1970s coffee commercial where the character is always talking to themselves about the things around them.  Gurney, I must admit reminded me of Sam, but only a little.  Whether you like this book or not, Dune cannot hold a candle to LOTR.<br />I must admit Dune has its interesting moments, but not enough for a good review.  The reader will find himself or herself saying over and over again, &quot;No, not another sand worm!&quot;  The writting style is deplorable.  Herbert's prose is some of the worst I have ever read.  Unlike Hawthorne, Dickens, and Melville, Herbert sentence structure is choppy, uneven, and cumbersome.<br />I made it through this book, but I must admit, it did not hold my interest and I did breeze over a few pages.  This book stinks!<br />I give it a B plus for over all creativity.<br />C minus for the story develpment<br />D minus for style.<br />D plus for Character development<br />F for the micro-font this edition is printed in<br />I know I am going to get tared and feathered for this review!
B0001UL7RY|4.0|Avril Lavigne's multi-platinum Grammy-nominated debut record &quot;Let Go&quot; was, to put it delicately, crap. It had a pocketful of nifty tunes such as &quot;I'm With You&quot; and &quot;Too Much To Ask,&quot; but Ms. Lavigne has all but declared it herself: &quot;Complicated&quot; sucks. And Avril, wearing the trendy costume her label picked out for her, pranced around proclaiming herself, to quote, &quot;Sid Vicious for a new generation!&quot; (Sid was the bassist, sweetie, and I don't see you blowing cigarette smoke into the faces of infants on airplanes). Then of course came the haters. Anti-Avrilism was more than a hobby; it was a religion. Scores of websites dedicated to bashing the poor little princess sprouted like weeds, all of them earnest and many of them hilarious. Soon following was the infamous &quot;Bowie rhymes with Howie&quot; incident, bruising her already ramshackle &quot;punk cred.&quot; And then came the Rolling Stone article, which beat the cred up and took its lunch money, revealing Avril had virtually no knowledge of any sort of music save modern Top 40 radio, she was a product of a label's wet dream, and -- the clincher -- she wrote maybe five whole words on &quot;Let Go.&quot;<br />And that's why &quot;Let Go&quot; sucked.<br />&quot;Under My Skin,&quot; Lavigne's sophomore effort, is a surprise to say the least. Lavigne penned all the songs, some of which on her own. And they're dark, crunchy, full of attitude and -- dare I say it -- more than a little bit deeper than her previous work. &quot;Don't Tell Me,&quot; the lead single, had music that sounded a little safe, but it's lyrics didn't -- who thought anyone could make a teen abstinence-promoting power ballad actually _work_? &quot;Don't try to tell me what to do,&quot; Avril asserts in the chorus, &quot;don't try to tell me what to say/You're better off that way.&quot; Oh, Avril. If only you took your own advice when you were making your first album and said that to the Matrix. If you had _this_ inside you maybe the haters would have been of fewer numbers. The fantastic &quot;Take Me Away&quot; paints a love so painful and all-consuming it could only happen to a teenager, &quot;My Happy Ending&quot; is angsty, forceful power-pop that will get stuck in your head for days, the chorus to &quot;Fall to Pieces&quot; is damn near breathtaking and &quot;He Wasn't&quot; is the bratty kiss-off many girls could take a cue from.<br />Dammit. It was fun to hate her. I guess I'll be removing that &quot;Avril Sucks&quot; button from my backpack now.<br />Sure, she's returned with a new wardrobe, looking suspiciously like her brilliant new adversary Katy Rose. Sure, Rose and Fefe Dobson have pretty much come along and (despite their misleadingly mainstream-sounding singles) been everything people expected Avril to be but better. Sure, this record is even _more_ processed, polished and overproduced than her debut. But rest assured, this is a damn good record. And it sounds great loud.
B0001MDP3G|5.0|I was so impressed with Cold Mountain, that I have ordered, the book, the soundtrack, and The Return to Cold Mountain cd. As a rule when I buy a 2 disc movie, the special feature's disc never comes out of the case. I am happy to say that I have watched the 2nd disc with Cold Mountain, and it was well worth the time. There is a 90 minute chapter devoted to the words and music of the movie, that makes it worth buying alone. The intertwining of the story line among each character was very well thought out. I was never a big fan of Zelleweger but she deserved the supporting actress award, and I am now a big fan! I think that Kidman had a lot to do with that, as I thought her performance was a little weak at times, and I am a big fan of Nicole!! Overall it was an excellent movie, the soundtrack was great, all acting was top notch, and I would not hesitate to purchase if I was you!
B000063DHK|5.0|Great songs, great performance, great stereophonic sound, I had that album in Vinyl in 85 and still rocks!!! =)<br />Im still waiting for the DVD...

B000001F3C|4.0|I've been listening to U2 for nearly ten years now, so it's fun to take a look back and possibly help someone else make the right album purchase.<br />&quot;War&quot; is an album which takes U2's anger at the fighting in their homeland of Ireland and turns it into music. It's quite good if you're in the mood for some edgy rock! This album, particularly &quot;Sunday, Bloody Sunday&quot;, is mostly very serious. If you're not the kind of person who likes really hard, serious rock, and you don't already know much U2, you might not warm up to this very quickly. Any other U2 album will be a lot easier on you if you're a beginner. If you're a huge fan, though, get it anyhow. It's a must-listen for a U2 buff, no matter what! Also, if you even like any rock music at all, you're sure to find a few tracks you like even if you don't like the whole album. I can't imagine anyone not liking at least two or three songs!<br />If you ever see U2 labelled as &quot;Christian Rock&quot;, it's because of some of the material on this album. Rest assured all you non-Christians, that is a misrepresentation and a misunderstanding of the material. The religious overtones of this album come from the nature of the conflicts that U2 are singing about here. The bombings in Ireland that made U2 so angry were all because of religious fighting. The song &quot;40&quot; is actually just a psalm, I think. From Psalm 40!  If you want more information on this stuff you can simply do a search for something like: Ireland bombings. You're sure to get all kinds of information on it. There's nothing to be afraid of here with regard to lyrics. It's all very relevant to things which continue to go on in the world today; one of U2's strong points has always been the ability of their music to remain relevant well beyond the date of it!<br />Now, if you're still not quite sure whether or not to get this album, I'd suggest trying to get ahold of the songs &quot;Two Hearts Beat as One&quot; and &quot;The Refugee&quot;. I find that these are the two most accessable songs, and if you get accustomed to the sound of them then you ought to be able to get used to and like the whole album.<br />Verdict: A very good album which does exactly what it sets out to do. If you like U2 or edgy rock music, get it immediately.
B00000JNO2|3.0|Not a bad album by any means, it's definetely worth the less-than-$10 you can pick it up for; however it seems to be missing something that's present in the other Skynyrd releases. It seems as if there is more filler-sounding material than in any of their other LPs. I didn't care for Tom Dowd's production on this album at all, and prefer the live/alternative versions of many of these songs that are available on other releases. I give it a big, &quot;OK&quot;.

Think of Roots, Gone With the Wind, even &quot;Josey Wales&quot; and &quot;he&quot; is there. How many love stories about doomed lovers? How many preachers gone &quot;bad&quot;? I liked the storyline &quot;basically&quot;, and the recreation of the &quot;Battle of the Crater&quot; at Petersburg, Virginia<BR>was &quot;very good&quot;,but the rest was almost too predictable,because of all the previous TV movies and theatrical releases we've seen about or based on the Civil War.<BR>    I thought the music and costuming was excellant,and the features included with the DVD are great! I only wish the movie was better,and I feel for the actors who tried, but could not overcome the screenplay. If you enjoy watching Nicole and Renee's<BR>work, you won't go wrong getting this DVD,if you are a movie fan,<BR>or collector, you may be disappointed.

B00008LDPU|5.0|This is a great DVD for Matrix fans and non-fans. I found the rennaisance stories worth the entire DVD. Final flight of the Osiris took my breath away. Kid's Story, if no one has noticed, is the story of the kid that appears giving ammo to the robots defending the deck in &quot;Revolutions&quot;. Finally, Beyond is THE story that'll change your mind if you, like me, are a programmer. Is this how bugs look like inside a program? How many times have you tested modules and then left them in the hard disk? When a system accesses a defective set of subroutines, do they look like this? When your OS repairs a defective function, do the deletion leaves other programs without a place to find solace, amusing? If you want your brain scrambled like the eggs in your breakfast, buy this one!!
B00004ZAV3|4.0|While, it's the most complete collection of The Beatles' biggest hits to date, &quot;1&quot; still leaves us a huge feeling of incompleteness. By limiting it to just numer one hits, many of their biggest hits - &quot;Do You Want To Know A Secret&quot;, &quot;She's A Woman&quot;, &quot;Tiwst And Shout&quot; and most glaringly &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; - are not here. <br />Don't get me wrong. I absolutely love the songs here. You can't argue the timelessnss of numbers like &quot;I Wanna Hold Your Hand&quot;, &quot;Lady Madonna&quot;, &quot;Come Together&quot;, &quot;Something&quot;, &quot;Love Me Do&quot; and the many others. <br />But still leaves a hairraising question: why couldn't this have been a boxd set of all their singles? A Boxed set would have pleased both casual fans and ones who have listened to them for years. The Beatles scored 70 chart entries between 1964 and 1996, and 32 of them made the top 10. With only 27 here, it leaves oom for more. I know it's going to take up space and proably won't get me any helpful vots, but here's a list of all the missing songs.<br />&quot;Please Please Me&quot; (number 3)<BR>&quot;I Saw Her Standing There&quot; (number 14)<BR>&quot;My Bonnie&quot; (number 26)<BR>&quot;From Me To You&quot; (number 41)<BR>&quot;Twist And Shout&quot; (number 2)<BR>&quot;Roll Over Beethoven&quot; (number 68)<BR>&quot;All My Loving&quot; (number 45)<BR>&quot;Do You Want To Know A Secrer&quot; (number 2)<BR>&quot;You Can't Do That&quot; (number 48)<BR>&quot;Thank You Girl&quot; (number 35)<BR>&quot;There's A Place&quot; (number 74)<BR>&quot;Why&quot; (number 88)<BR>&quot;P.S.

All these great hits are missing. Just hope that a boxed set will be released in the future.
0671027387|5.0|Am I decieving you when I tell you this is the best book I've ever read ? You will have to buy it to find out for yourself, ha ha ha ha ha !!! This book was written buy a guy named dan brown, but what does that mean ? I don't know, just buy the darn book, or I might get really angry and smash my keyboard.
0671027387|1.0|Dan seems to have forgetton that Ellesmere Island is part of the Country called Canada.  So his highly improbable characters romp over Canada's sovereignty with the clear implication that the US owns the world.  And I'm not a Canadian!  Boy those Mounties up there must be dumb to not notice a huge American operation taking place in their backyard.<br />He stretches too far in his attempt to characterize weapons, computer and communications technology about which it is obvious he knows very little.<br />His scenarios of corruption and deceipt in high levels of government are so unrealistic they appear cartoon-like.

B0001MDP3G|5.0|I also could not get this movie out of my head -- that has never happened to me before.  Somehow, it reached deep into my soul and I vicariously experienced what really happens in life -- war, peace, sorrow, tragedy, triumph, love, twists and turns that defy logic.  It helped me understand my country and the American people in a way I never have before. I have not read the book Cold Mountain but the impetus is now there.  I was surprised too and saddened that it did not get nominated for Best Picture -- but I tend to prefer realism to fantasy.  The the nomination of Jude Law for Best Actor and Best Supporting Acress award was gratifying.  Amazing -- buy it -- watch it.
B0000DD7LB|3.0|This CD (In The Zone) is not my type of music at all.  I am going to be fair and write it in a point of view of a person who likes this type of music.<br />Britney Spears' new CD (In The Zone) is a much better CD than her last, her first single Me Aganist the Music is a mediocre pop song featuring the legendary Madonna.  Madonna and Britney's duet makes for a great sing along song to pump on the radio.  This song will most likely top the charts and will definetly be the favorite of teenage girls across the world.  Another top charter is the racy song Toxic. This music video is an MTV classic and the song is definetly a favorite in dance clubs.  Another dance song is Outrageous.  With a pulsing beat this song makes you want to dance.  One song that stands apart from all the songs on the CD is Everytime.  This song is a true pop ballad that is one of the only songs in which Spears actually (shocker!) expresses emotion.  This album sucks (by my standards) but will be a teenage girls dream.
B00007LTIB|5.0|I always thought the initital recording of this album was dull and faint.  This remastering brightens the album up and gives it more respect that it deserves.  I read a previous review that the lows are too low and the highs are trimmed and that this takes from the guitar tone.  I didn't think so.<br />In a nutshell the album is more dynamic, but doesn't deviate from the original recording.
B00008H2LB|1.0|Ok, I'm not one of those idiots who's part of the anti-Numetal crusade. I do reconize some fine bands between the regular crap from this genre (SOAD, Slipknot, Disturbed etc), but this band isn't one of them.<BR>Let me begin with the beginning: I thought Hybrid Theory was an ok album. While the band clearly had to mature and wrote all of their songs in the same way, it was still a fairly nice debute. They only needed to expand from the typical nu-metal clichés and write riffs that didn't sound like KoRn rip-offs. So I was hoping they would progress the next time.  <BR>Sadly, this record doesn't expand or progress in any way. Quite the opposite actually. This record is a step backward in allmost every aspect.<BR>I'll admit, the first song did hold my attention, but it all goes downhill from there.<BR>Song structures are typical and predictable. Once the main-riff kicks in, you can predict exactly how the rest of the song will go. High screamy chorus, calm verses, bridge.... Yawn.  <BR>Guitars sound even more like KoRn then they did on Hybrid Theory. On some songs they didn't even try to write a riff anymore and just hit some random chord, do nothing for 20 seconds, and then hit another (or the same) chord. ZZZZZZ.<BR>The singing mostly consists out of screaming on top of your voice. Result: allmost every chorus sounds the same (Breaking the Habit is the only positive exeption) and Chesters voice gets downright annoying. They even can't come up with some decent singlines or melodies (elements that where present on Hybrid Theory). Don't even get me started on the lyrics. ZZzzzzZZZ.<BR>The rapping is ok, but gets repeative since it sounds exactly the same on every track. He should try an agressive rap for a change (or maybe they should reverse roles from a change: sing/scream in verses, rap in chorus). <BR>Drumming is nothing exeptional. Bass... What bass?<BR>The DJ is the only member that seems to have *some* talent. He picked some good samples. But that doesn't savethe cd.<br />Result: every song sounds the same, like a watered down version of a song that has been done before on the first album, repeating every nu-metal cliché you can possibly come up with.  <BR> I won't go into song-by-song breakdown, but for example &quot;Numb&quot; should have been called &quot;Pushing me away part 2, but without the good melodies&quot; instead. Nothing jumps out. The only song I kinda like is &quot;Breaking the habit&quot;, since it has a solid chorus.<BR>Add to this an awfully &quot;perfect&quot; sounding production, and the few dynamics still left are completely killed.<BR>So don't waste your time on this utterly uninspired and boring record. Buy Disturbed or the new Slipknot cd instead if you want some actual musical talent.  <BR>*rant over*
B000002KYR|5.0|This formidable POWER TRIO has been playing since 70's.This self-made tough BLUES band made a change.That is &quot;MTV BOOM&quot;.The visual side is overstressed in the VIDEO clips.Luckily enough these guys had a comical appearance and a very long beard.The media mix tactics made them a big star.In the end,this album made a big breakthrough.All in all ,this album can be called &quot;COMMERCIAL BREAKTHROUGH BY A ZZ TOP WITH A TOUCH OF HARD ROCK&quot;.Songwriting sense is superb,indeed.
0312995423|1.0|As much as I don't like to leave things unfinished, honestly - I had to put it down after 100 &quot;chapters.&quot;  I just couldn't bring myself to waste any more of my evening time.  To say this book does not captivate is an overstatement.<br />The characters do not develop through the book, the writing style is primitive.  So, if you are over 10 years old - go read something else.
B000002J03|5.0|This is by far the best album of the Led, which is saying alot because almost everyone of their albums was great! I would highly recommend this album to whoever is unfamiliar with Led Zeppelin or is familiar. Fabulous!
B000002GVO|1.0|Take yourself back to 1976.  Rock was growing tired.  Bands like the Eagles had their string of hits and were losing their imagination.  So what do the Eagles do?  They hire Joe Walsh and dedicate the rest of their professional careers to POP.<br />It was music like this that spawned the disco and punk backlash.  If you want some good Eagles music, skip this one (and The Long Run), and pick up one of their first few LPs.
0618526412|2.0|I find this book boring. I've had it for a month and can't bring myself to pick it up any more.
0446677450|5.0|I found this book to very resourceful and to the point. It was brief, concise and used laymen's terms while providing real-life examples and simple diagrams. This resource will not give you much in the way of step-by-step instruction on how to attain your financial goals, but is definitely useful as an eye-opening inspirational guide that will allow one to soul-search and face the truth as to why he/she is not excelling financially. At the very least, it provides a foundation on how to teach our youth the value and power of achieving wealth - the honest way. I intend on pursuing more in this excellent series.
0064471837|5.0|Garth Nix has created a tangible world, with just enough detail to keep it real while still moving the story along at a page-turning pace.  The heroine Sabriel, thoroughly likeable, jumps into the task with constucted confidence, the seven necromentic bells, and her knowledge of Charter Magic. Still, she comes to realize that, even with her training, she doesn't know nearly enough.  Coupled with the formerly-petrified Touchstone and the bitter, sarcastic cat-servent Mogget, she must find the \\"Abhorsen Emeritus\\" (her father) and defeat the dangerous enemy Kerrigor before Kerrigor destroys her.  This wonderful and original book goes right along with others of its nature, such as Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials trilogy.  I highly recommend it, with the rest of the Abhorsen trilogy.
B00002ZMNV|5.0|This combines the best of classical music from the San Francisco Symphony and metal music from the greatest metal band Metallica.<BR>They open the show with the symphony playing the infamous &quot;Ecstacy of Gold&quot; and straight in to  the instrumental &quot;The Call of Ktulu&quot; one of Metallica fans absolute favorites which they rarely play live on their set list. Two new songs are also included on this DVD, &quot;No Leaf Clover&quot; which is done brilliantly in combination with the sympony and the detuned &quot;-Human&quot; with a heavy main riff. There is also a multi angle feature so you can follow any four of the Metallica members or the conduter Michael Kamen individually through the songs: Fuel, Sad But True, Of Wolf and Man and Enter Sandman.<BR>There is also a feature as to mute the orchestra or mute metallica which is nice if you find either of them boring. The setlist is ended with a great performance of Battery.<BR>A must have for all hardcore fans, a great DVD from the greatest live band in the world.
0060005424|5.0|I'll sing you a song of long ago--<BR>Seven shine the Shiners, oh!<BR>What did the Seven do, way back when?<BR>Why, they wove the Charter then!<BR>Five for the warp, from beginning to end,<BR>Two for the woof, to make an mend.<BR>That's the Seven, but what of the Nine?<BR>What of the two who chose not to shine?<BR>The Eighth did hide, hide all away,<BR>But the Seven caught him and made him pay.<BR>The Ninth was strong and fought with might,<BR>But lone Orannis was put out of the light,<BR>Broken in two and buried under hill,<BR>Forever to lie there, wishing us ill.<br />In the second book of the Abhorsen trilogy, we meet Lirael, the Sightless Clayr who is a bit of a puzzle.  She has dark hair and light skin that burns, not tanning deeply like it should with shining blond hair like the real Clayr.  She has never been Seen, either, by the sorceresses in the ice, a mystery to all.  She throws herself into her work as an Assistant Librarian in the Great Library of the Clayr, creates a dog-sending (the Disreputable Dog), and takes secret expeditions into all sorts of places -- including places she probably (definitely) isn't allowed to go.  Finally, sent by the Clayr out of their Glacier, she meets up with Prince Sameth, Sabriel and Touchstone's son, after he has left the palace. Presumably the Abhorsen in Waiting, Sameth cannot stand the bells, though he travels with the Abhorsen's servent Mogget.  Together, Lirael and Sameth must journey to right the evil in the Kingdom and become who they were both born to be -- though with surprising twists.  <br />A definite must-read, Lirael is a compelling book.  You should probably read Sabriel (the first in the Abhorsen trilogy) beforehand, and you won't be able to resist reading the third book when you finish the second.  I myself read the 1,713 page trilogy in two an a half days.  Garth Nix is a masterful writer. Go read the books!
6305736650|2.0|This film appears to have badly aged. Old sentimental and patriotic rhetoric about the &quot;tough guy with tender heart&quot;, helpless woman who &quot;suffers&quot; because she's torn between two lovers, manichean vision of the good (Americans), rather lost (French collaborators), and bad (the Germans) guys. Even Titanic seemed much more convincing. <BR>And why is it that Humphrey Bogart is supposed to be such a seductive legend? I find him dull and devoid of expression, much less empathy. I guess most of the enthusiasm for this film comes from old-age men. Those who are still admiring the patronizing male.
B00008S2VG|1.0|It's a wonder she's still recording. She's not a singer, but a sad wannabe of Britney these days(who's currently topping the Billboard single charts), while every single from Madonna's lastest AL, has failed to make the top 100, with the exception of the title track. She should have packed it in after the dismal sales, and stopped while she still had some dignity left. Now I guess she still wants to be the only one left on this earth along with the cockroaches, when all is said and done.
B00004Y6OA|4.0|At first I was skeptical about this 3rd album by the godly Van Halen because it is one of the overlooked albums, but it is also the most underrated. I would rate this the 3rd best Van Halen album. Michael Anthony was at the top of his game, It was arguably DLR's best performance, Eddie was still on top of it, and it had remarkable work by Alex. \\"And The Cradle Will Rock\\" is a popular song from the album but I personally don't think it's that great of a song. \\"Romeo Delight\\" is the hardest, and pretty close to the best song i've ever heard. It's hard, fast, has catchy lyrics, and the ending riff blew me away. This is the best work Michael Anthony ever did on bass, and one of the best Alex did on the drums. The lead in song \\"Tora! Tora!\\" is good but they could of added it to \\"Loss of Control\\", or just not put it in at all. \\"Loss of Control\\" is another of the good songs and the second best in my oppinion. \\"Take Your Whiskey Home\\" is like a funny version of \\"Ice Cream Man\\" off of VH1 it begins with Dave on the acoustic, and it has funny lyrics, and he hiccups while singing the song.<br />If your into harder songs, and your a VH fan, this is definatly the album your looking for. \\"Everybody Wants Some\\", \\"Fools\\", \\"Romeo Delight\\", \\"Loss of Control\\", and the killer finisher \\"In A Simple Rhyme\\" are all good songs and any one of those songs alone are worth the money. This is the most underated album, but I can't see why. It is a must have for any Van Halen fan.
B000002MFN|1.0|Throw this album, along with her career, in the garbage!  Madonna, your 15 minutes of fame are over with!!!! Good-bye!
B000003CMB|5.0|Two brothers, two drummers, a master bass player and some harmonica too.  The kids were from Georgia and the blues ran through their blood.  Duane and Dickey knew how to make their guitars sing in unison.  Gregg's voice and organ playing was perfect.  Everything that was ever 'right' about the ABB is captured on this release.  Its all been said, but I'll say it again.....there is no better live album on the planet that this one.....its the best of the best
B0000DJZ8R|5.0|It's striking how many reviewers here base their comments on a simplisitic comparison between the film version of &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; and the Steinbeck novel on which it was based. For many such a comparison seems to function simply as an excuse to proclaim the inherent superiority of the Steinbeck original--and, by extension, the superiority of their own literary taste values-- when all it really does is highlight the patent silliness of trying to pit different artforms into some sort of evaluative competition. Literature and cinema are two vastly different modes of representation each with their own strengths and limitations, so the framing question shouldn't be which version of &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; is &quot;better&quot;--as if there were a universal yardstick with which to measure such things--but rather how do they perform in terms of their respective mediums? On that count, I think we are extraordinarily fortunate with both the Steinbeck and Ford versions of &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; to have two masterworks that operate consummately at the peak of their respective artforms. What each does well, it does brilliantly. As a verbal medium that unfolds slowly, literature is good at offering rich, layered descriptions of person and place and mapping complicated narrative links and Steinbeck makes the most of this in his novel. Cinema, by contrast, is an expressive medium that works best through registers of visual and aural metaphor, allegory and performance...and it's on this ground that I think the film version of &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; more than merits its classic status. It is a magnificently &quot;cinematic&quot; film that uses the expressive capacities of the medium to produce a richly layered experience that is truly moving and that lingers long afterward, sometimes for years or even a whole lifetime. I first saw &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; on TV one rainy afternoon in my childhood and it left indelible impressions thathave impelled me to go back to the film time and again: The haunted eyes of Jane Darwell's Ma Joad as she sits in the truck cabin, lit from beneath, driving into an uncertain future, the winds of history howling oustside; the terrifying collision montage as the monstrous &quot;cats&quot; move in to destroy the Okies' homes; the soulless gas station attendants, standing together in uniforms like corporatized automata, muttering that the Joads are too miserable to be human. It's a film dense with iconic richness and an enduring testament both to the artistry of the many workers that created it, and to the democratic spirit of popular cinema at its very best.
B000003CMC|5.0|The ABB put out 5 albums between '68 and '73.  Every note on this release stands as a classic.  As some of the reviewers have said, some of this is live material and the rest from a series of sessions before and after Duane's passing.  It captures this band at their peak.  It also features some of the sweet sounds of Dickey Betts.  The ABB were to put out one more outstanding release after this (Brothers and Sisters), then it was all down hill.<br />This is a must-have record and I would rate it as their second-best release behind Live at the Filmore East.
B0000CG9N8|5.0|Really good musicians! Absolution is the next step on their music, it shows a maturity on their studio work and the way they use electronic sequences along with the perfect performance of guitar, piano and drums; make this album a Master Piece, a new Classic. If you liked the &quot;Origin of Simetry&quot; this one won't dissapoint you.
B000268QB2|5.0|Wow.<br />I had been reading through Spin magazine on 'Top 50 bands to look out for' and Keane was featured with a description of, &quot;Described as Coldplay minus the guitarist&quot; and that caught my attention. I visited Keane's website and heard some audio clips (they hadn't an album out yet) and hearing those tracks really got me interested for their album.<br />A few months passed and I bought the album, and let me say... audio clips do no justice. You only hear 30 seconds of a few songs... be prepared to be blown away. The song &quot;Somewhere Only We Know&quot; is a simple song, but just has this power behind it. The second track, &quot;This Is The Last Time&quot; starts out with just a piano and then unwinds into a rocker that you can feel almost &quot;lift&quot; you up. Another song, &quot;She Has No Time&quot; may be one of the best ballads ever written. These guys have a lot of passion in their music. I mean I can just FEEL the passion in the vocals and the music.<br />These are songs that you will be singing days after you listen to this cd. For me, I kept singing the whole album song by song. There is no 'bad' song, nor any 'good couple of songs' on this album. EVERY track is filled with power, passion and done to perfection. <br />So what do they compare to, you ask?<br />I would say a bit of Coldplay (but not Chris Martin-ish vocals) with a bit of U2 (think a bit of All That You Can't Leave Behind, mixed with Joshua Tree) and The Beatles.<br />Overall, this record is just outstanding. There are many debut albums that I have discovered that have taken my breath away, this one took more of it away. Buy the album, crank the volume up, and enjoy a lush, well crafted, beautiful record.
B000003TA4|2.0|Nobody here is taking a firm, honest stand on rating Nirvana's Nevermind. You've got the disgustingly ill-informed on one side telling you Nevermind's better than any Beatles record, and then you have the anarchists on another who bash Nirvana, Kurt Cobain, and the entire hypocritical \\"ethos\\" that all Grunge bands and fans seemed to hold. The people who claim Nevermind is THE best album of all time, or even one of the top 500 albums of all time need to take a step back and listen to the thousands of other records by thousands of other fairly-mainstream artists, and then make their choice. The people who bash Nirvana and the fans of the Grunge \\"movement\\" (or what I like to call \\"fad fizzle\\") need to take a step back and realize they're rating the music and not the ideals of the people involved. But I suppose it's hard to rate music without considering the social impact it has made. If I were to rate Nirvana and Kurt Cobain's influence and impact that he had and continues to have, I'd rate it as very poor because Grunge just lead to over 13 years and counting of badly-made music devoid of social conscience. Sure, some people say Kurt Cobain inspired them to pick up a guitar, but I'm sure he inspired many more to pick up a gun and shoot themselves over his loss. But that's just my opinion. If I were to rate Nirvana's Nevermind album compared to the other semi-mainstram acts of their day (which is a completely fair comparison), I'd give it two out of five stars. Nevermind was never anything to get too excited about. And contrary to what people here are saying, Nirvana's sound wasn't new, and it certainly wasn't as abrasive as they like to believe. J. Mascis, whose band Nirvana toured with in the early 90's, was a much more inventive in pioneering scruffy melodi-rock. The best songs off Nevermind are all the singles except for \\"In Bloom\\", which I never liked at all. The rest is uninspired rock that needs some lyric enhancements and melody transplants... stat! <br />For alternatives to the supposedly \\"alternative\\" Nirvana, here are some lovely albums that could seep into one's skull with their mixture of sweetness and bile both at the same time:<br />\\"Whatever's Cool With Me\\" (by J. Mascis' Dinosaur Jr.)<BR>\\"Siamese Dream\\" (by The Smashing Pumpkins)<BR>\\"Shooting Rubberbands at the Stars\\" (by Edie Brickell & New Bohemians)
B00020HEG6|5.0|This is the best soundtrack recording that I've heard in recent years. John Williams's compositions surpassed his earlier efforts for the Harry Potter series both in terms of style and imagination. The music is rich, with excellent orchestration. But what makes it so special is that, not only does it complement the mood in the film to perfection, it also has class, which cannot be said for most soundtracks recordings of even the most popular of films. Like many, I find the the children's chorus to be just wicked!<br />Recommended without reservations.
B000000WJZ|4.0|The Pumpkins' Siamese Dream is a lovely rock album with its fuzzed-out guitar wanderings and beautifully-bizarre lyrics that only us Pumpkins fans can appreciate, and dare I use the L-word... Love? Of course, the same can be said about their debut Gish, but Siamese Dream has a slightly delicate edge to it that makes it more dear to me. &quot;Today&quot; and &quot;Disarm&quot; are my absolute favorites, but there are quite a few gems in there alongside material that sounds like a massive wall of noise to an unfamiliar listener. The person below who only likes the Siamese Dream singles is missing out on more than they realize when they say they aren't going to try listening to another certain Pumpkins album. That's a hint to run over to a place that lends out CDs (like your library) and borrow &quot;Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness&quot;! It's such an amazing double disc set! &quot;Bullet With Butterfly Wings&quot;, &quot;1979&quot;, and &quot;Tonight Tonight&quot; are nary impossible to not enjoy!
B00024BHTC|1.0|I was interested from many of the reviews to find out what all the hype is about.  After subsequenty listening to half this album I can only say one thing 'it's all been done before'.  I can say this with confidence because I have been listening to neo-classical shred and Opera Rock since the 70's.  There is no genre, as the genre has passed.  The only original thing about this music is that the band hail from Finland.  Though there have been many bands over the past 20 years that have attempted to release metal based music like this, a heavy rock riff (usually always tuned down a couple of steps) followed by keyboards playing symphony, with a high pitched singer, (This isn't a very good singer anyway).  If you have never heard music like this before and enjoy it then thats cool.  But if you have a wider experience of metal/rock then I would avoid as you would probably agree with me that the composition of the tracks have been ripped off from other bands in the past.  So to some up, unoriginal.

Bedtime Stories was the first step, then the second is \\"something to remember\\"<BR>STR is a collection of old madonna ballads plus some new material.<BR>The old material is placed correctly to keep old fans, then the new to take some new...and it works! (STR sold more than BS and erotica)<BR>The overall result is an album that sounds really simple and good, really listenable and enjoyable.<BR>The collaboration between Madonna and Massive Attack (I Want You) it's one of the best madonna tracks.<BR>Other Highlights include \\"You'll see\\" , \\"I'll remember\\" (the first time on an album) and the remix of \\"love don't live here anymore\\". The old tracks are ok.<BR>This is to proove you that madonna is not only a \\"sex about woman\\".
B000059T1E|5.0|I first heard this album when it was released. I have owned it and played it ever since. It is one of my top 3 favorite &quot;desert island&quot; albums. I own it in vinyl, cassette, and CD. Buy it. Now.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|Grammy Award Winner Alicia Keys is back with a strong sophomore effort.  I love the way she phrases the lyrics in her songs.  She sings about the different aspects of being in love so well.  Her voice is smooth, sexy and soulful.  My favorite song on this album is You Don't Know My Name,  because I like the idea of a woman making the first move on a man she really likes.<br />I love the way Alicia sings the track Heartburn.  This song has a lot of energy, and it made me want to move around and dance.  Diary is another stand out track in my opinion.  It is a great song about having someone in your life who you can trust to tell your secrets and is loyal to you.<br />  I also loved the song If I Aint Got You.  I think this song is a reminder that material things don't really bring you lasting satisfaction and  The only thing that matters in life is having someone to love.  Slow Down is an excellent song about trying to slow down in a relationship and getting to know the person you are attracted to.  I really enjoyed listening Diary of Alicia Keys.  She is a true talent who will be around for many years.
B0001ZX0PG|4.0|This is one of the best DVD's I have been able to enjoy for a while.  I never saw this in the theater and I am glad that I waited.<br />The characters Sean Penn, Tim Robbins and Kevin Bacon are excellent.  Throughout the movie because of Clint Eastwood's style of directing you feel as though you know who really did what and it makes sense but when you find out the truth you realize that that was the more sane explanation.  It is a real intellectual thriller. <br />The extras are good on this movie especially the commentary by Kevin Bacon and Tim Robbins.  WATCH OUT though, if you are watching the movie for the first time, don't use the commentary because they give away the plot and critical themes before the end of the movie.  They are pretty hilarious and that gives you a better understanding of the movie.  It helps you catch things that you would not have notice like the only time that Tim Robbins character tells the truth.  <br />I would highly recommend this movie if you enjoy intellectual thrillers.  It's not a lot of blood and guts but gives you many emotional turns from happy, to sad, to revenge, to helplessness.
0792163710|3.0|Shane, 1952 film  A lone rider approaches a family ranch. He observes a gang riding up to order the owner off his land. There is an economic conflict between a big land owner and small ranchers who are bringing in Jersey cows and working the land for agriculture. The big land owner wants to eliminate competition from small businesses; his government contract shows his political connections. The film shows the use of barbed wire, the invention that put an end to the open range. The settlers go into town for supplies. A barroom brawl occurs when Shane is attacked; Joe Starrett joins in to help his hired hand. Tavern owner Riker sends to Cheyenne for a hired gun, Jack Wilson, for a final solution to the homesteader problem.  The settlers gather for a July 4th celebration. They hear of Riker’s hired gunfighter. That evening Riker show up to make a final offer to Starrett: join him for a good price, and abandon the other small ranchers. This offer is refused. The next day the gunfighter insults Torrey to force a duel, and kills him. Joe Starrett announces he will go into town next, without waiting for the other settlers. The question is: shall the people be oppressed and swindled by a rich powerful landowner? (Most of the large ranches were owned by corporations from back East.) Some of the small ranchers decide to abandon their claims. Yet they have the right to settle and farm the land. “This country wasn’t made for just one man.” The burning of one home makes the settlers decide to hang on for a while.  Riker makes an offer to draw Starret to his place (for an ambush). Calloway turns up to warn Shane of this trick. Starrett’s wife argues for giving up and moving out now. (Credible?). Shane tries to stop Starrett, and they fight in the dark (to hide their body doubles?). Shane wins and leaves to keep the appointment, and force a final showdown. Shane successfully resolves the problem of Jack Wilson, then Riker, and moves on to new territory. [This avoids anyretribution by Riker’s allies.) [This film uses the dime novel fantasy of a “fast draw”, which did not occur in historical records.]  This story is loosely based on the Johnson County war near the Powder River in Wyoming. In reality, the settler’s militia drove off the armed gang hired by the large landowners. The large ranchers tried to get rid of small ranchers by passing a law that gave them sole rights to all cattle in the state! Read the chapter in William Weir’s “Written With Lead” for more details. “Unhappy are the people who want a hero.”
B00005Q4CS|3.0|The film was pretty good. A true depiction of addiction. Pretty edgy at times. The thing is, with the MTV style cinematography, this film will not date well. I am referring to the &quot;self cam&quot; that proceeds the characters as they walk around. The type of cam used for shows such as MTV's &quot;Fear&quot;, where you can view the expressions of the participant as they walk around. In 15 or 20 years this will be atrocious. It ruined the chances of this film becoming a classic.
0515123447|4.0|I loved this book from the first page. I devoured this book, unable to put it down. I read it in less than a week which is saying a lot for me. I liked Jack Reacher a lot. He's got a past, he's not all good, but he's the good guy. \\"Sometimes good guys don't wear white.\\" If were to compare him to any character, I'd say John McClane from Die Hard or even Blondie from The Good, The Bad and The Ugly (the greatest Western ever made!). He's a bad ass you have to like. He is the anti-hero you want to see in any action flick.<BR>  <BR>I found the other characters likeable but not very deep. Part of this is because Child never explores them much, this is after all a jack Reacher novel, and in part because they all have single-name names, Roscoe, Finlay, Hubble. I didn't mind. I found it easy to follow and not confuse characters. The bad guys were stock, smarmy, and slimy, straight out of The Dukes of Hazzard, easy to hate.<br />The back cover mentions the brutal violence. Many reviewers mentioned the extreme violence. I didn't think that the violence was all that bad. When its there, its quick and brutal, sure, but its not like its in every chapter, a non-stop Quentin Tarantino ode to violence. Certainly not any worse than the Bourne Identity or Point of Impact. Perhaps thin skinned people shouldn't read thrillers.<br />While a minor, minor subplot, though really the anchor of the book,  I did enjoy the faint tangent of Reacher searching for the story of blues legend Blind Blake.It added just a hint of depth to Reacher.<br />Overall, a great book. If you are a Tarantino fan, if you loved Die Hard, if you like a fast paced no holds barred action-thriller, you will love this book. Ignore the petty detail stuff like the shrugging and simple names. Otherwise, try Robert Ludlum or Stephen Hunter. I have to admit I am tempted to read the next Jack Reacher novel, after all I want to find the answer to \\"all Jack knows is he didn't kill anybody. Not in their town, and not for a longtime...\\"<br />For more details, go to aj.huff.org. Thanks.
B00000DFTG|5.0|In 1979 Ozzy Osbourne was fired from Black Sabbath or quit, depending who's side of the story you wanna believe. It was to be over eighteen years before the original lineup got back together, although there were brief moments of hope for the fans like the one off performance at Live Aid in 1985. In fact, over those eighteen years Sabbath had recorded ten different albums, all of which had different personnel. Twenty-three musicians had been through the ranks, not counting hundreds of auditions.<br />Giant Stonehenge monoliths for the stage that could not be fitted into the concert halls they were playing; Dwarfs on stage; famous vocalists who did not know the lyrics to classic Sabbath songs; getting lost on the way to the stage; and drummers disappearing into the dry ice. You name it, Sabbath had either done it, or somebody had done it to them. But through it all there were still some great moments and great albums from both, Sabbath and Ozzy, who's own band was just as liquid as Sabbaths. (Ozzy Osbourne, with the help of his wife Sharon, had gone on to be far more commercially successful than Sabbath had ever been. The two of them had been the main inspiration for a movie called 'Spinal Tap'.)<br />Realizing the time was right, and to be fair, they probably realized a buck or two could be made out of the gig, it was decided to put the original Black Sabbath together and do those songs properly again.  Bridges were built and contracts were signed (which was more than Sabbath managed the first time around). They never received a dime in royalties for their first album as they were paid a one off sum of one thousand pounds, given two days to record, and that was it.  The album went top twenty all over the world, is still on the Billboard lists today, over thirty four years later, and has been re-licensed to different labels countless times. Smart move, boys.<br />As a token of goodwill their home town of Birmingham, England, was chosen for the comeback concerts, so the giant N.E.C. Stadium was booked to present the reunited Black Sabbath on two dark wet and windy nights in December 1997. Fearing that this could be a one off if Sabbath soon returned to their old habits, it was decided to record the whole thing for posterity. Add to that the fact that the boys were not as young anymore either. Rehearsals were a little tense, but apart from Bill Ward missing the odd flight and Toni Iommi setting Bill's beard on fire, things went better than expected. But would the magic still be there when they took to the stage?<br />Before going on stage the band admitted they had never been so nervous in all their careers.  However, when the pre-recorded opening sirens and announcements boomed across the stage the band walked out and the crowd went mental. 'War Pigs', first played live by Sabbath in 1969, shuddered the rafters and thundered out of the speakers. By the time Ozzy came in with the first verse, they have got it, the groove was back. Not only the band knew it, the audience felt it too and went berserk along with their heroes. Toni Iommi established what the whole world knew anyway, he was the master of the heavy metal riff, his searing solos were splattered across every song, driving the band onto further heights.<br />On the audio C.D. you can hear Geezer Butler throwing his bass guitar around, leaving the template for all heavy metal bassists. Truly a Master of Reality as he nails every note.<br />On the drums there is Bill Ward, playing the bins with hammer blows reaching technical ecstasy.<br />Ozzy comes through the Blizzard of sound, taunting the crowd onto a higher musical plain between songs, belting out the lyrics as only Ozzy can. After all, nobody has ever actually accused him of being able to sing.<br />Geoff Nichols is unheard and unseen throughout the concert; merely a supporting role.<br />But what you get is two hours of the live beast, plus two newly recorded studio tracks as a bonus. All the classics are played alongside some other songs that should of been classics (and would of been if they had been in other bands' repertoires). Sabbath had such a wealth of songs that some got forgotten over a period of time.<br />I for one am truly grateful that these concerts were recorded and released, as the original lineup never released a proper live album first time round. So this is a great memento of one of rock's immortal giants.  After what they have been through they must be immortal.<br />I leave you with the opening lyrics to 'Children Of The Grave', written by Geezer Butler in 1971, which shows, I think, that not only in their heavy riffs and solid rhythms were Black Sabbath years ahead of everybody else. Who would of thought that there would be social awareness from this bunch of brummies?<br />`So you children of the world, listen to what I say,<br />If you want a better place to live in, spread the word today,<br />Show the world that love is still alive, you must be brave,<br />Or You children of today are children of the grave.'<br />Mott the Dog<br />Remastered by Ella Crewd alongside some other songs that should of been classics (and would of been if they had been in other bands' repertoires).

B000066NW0|5.0|This album is so great. i got it and i listened to it a million times<BR>                     DEFINETLY RECOMENDED
B0001AP12G|5.0|It's good to see something come out that is actually good throughout the whole disc. And the good part about this is that he is being himself and not a portrait of something he is not. I wish more rappers will look into being yourself than hardcore. For God's sake, he went double platinum by being himself. WOW!!!!! The album is nice. The production was pretty decent for him. Like it, brought it, suggest you do the same.<BR>Top 3 Songs: Graveship, Through The Wire, School Spirit<BR>Bottom 3 Songs: Workout Plan, Family Business, The Skits<BR>Slepper: Two Words
B0001UL7RY|3.0|i heard this album and i enjoyed it but i didn't think that it was as great as her first album but this cd is still good.<BR>Some of the good songs are My happy Ending  Nobody's Home and Don't Tell Me
6301966562|5.0|I remember first watching this film when it was released on video in 1984, I was about 14 at the time and I still remember it's captivating quality to this day....and I haven't seen it since :(<BR>When the computer started to play along with the girl playing the musical instrument, it sent a huge tingle down my spine....I just had to have a computer. This movie is probably why I love computers so much to this very day. I love creating music on them, just like Edgar did. I'm still listening to 80's music today, and Electric Dreams is one of my favourites. I need to see this movie again and relive the magic feeling it gave me all those years ago.<br />Get this released on DVD NOW!!!! it would be a crime not to.
B000002KNY|5.0|I feel that, although many think Remain in Light is Talking Heads' best, that this distinction clearly bleongs to the brilliantly paranoid Fear of Music. It starts off with King Crimson's Robert Fripp joining the band African tinged funk of \\"I Zimbra\\". Next comes \\"Mind\\", a catchy little song with a cool guitar line and some amazing lyrics. \\"Paper\\" is a funky number with lyrics about, you guessed it, paper. Only Talking Heads could pull off a song like this. \\"Life During Wartime\\" is probably the classic off of this album if you haven't heard it you probably shouldn't be here. Next is \\"Cities\\" which is one of the catchiest songs I've heard in my life. It's also neck and neck with \\"Life During Wartime\\" as my favorite song on this album. \\"Memories Can't Wait\\" has a really cool atmosphere and features a paranoid and crazy chorus that only David Byrne could deliver. Next is \\"Air\\", a new wavey song that is a classic paranoid David Byrne rant about pollution. \\"Heaven\\" is also definitly up there with \\"Cities\\" and \\"Life During Wartime\\" as my favorites. If I was a better writer I would try to describe the beauty of this song, but I can't so I won't. Then comes \\"Animals\\", its funny that there is a song with this title on this album because I always thought this album was to Talking Heads as Animals was to Pink Floyd, thier underrated masterpiece. Anyways \\"Animals\\" is a hilarious and paranoid song that seems to be a protest song against animals. Again only David Byrne could pull this off and make it song cool. \\"Electric Guitar\\" is the only weak song on here but that is complety made up for by the next song. \\"Drugs\\" is an awesome and atpmospheric song about drugs. Brian Eno plays a huge role in elevating this song. <br />I loved this album and (if your a Talking Heads fan) so will you (plays Reading Rainbow segue).
B0001BKAEY|5.0|This movie was really great the special effects on it where totally ofer welming so grat its absolutly one of the most best science fiction film of all times.

B00005JKJA|5.0|In the reviews I've browsed here, a lot of viewers have come up with fine stuff about this film, and gone far to explain its weird grasp on people, at least on viewers adventurous and patient enough to deal with it.  Not surprising that fans are obsessive about it; it's haunting. Maybe uncanny is a better word. I wanted to add a few points to the ongoing discussion.<br />The atmospheric shooting is splendid as many observe below, but there's another subtlety throughout, unless my memory's playing tricks: when the two women are together, even standing beside each other, Diane looks more or less real while Rita looks unreal, the details of her features hard to grasp. I don't know if that's done with makeup, lighing, computers, or what. <br />In movies like \\"Belle du Jour\\" and \\"Persona\\" which are partly dreams, the directors give us at least a signal to tell us what's real and what isn't. If I remember right, in Belle a cat meows every time Deneuve has one of her fantasies. Persona shows us Nurse Alma going to sleep and waking up--but later Bergman deliberately witholds those cues.<br />The thing about Mulholland Drive is, there's no overt cue at all that most of the film is Diane's dream---we can only understand that in retrospect. In other words, we have to wait till near the end to hear \\"Wake up, little lady.\\" In retrospect, then, we can understand the surreal intensification of the colors, and the way the apparent realism starts to disintegrate in the theater scene: Lynch is preparing us for the shock of finding it's all been a dream.<br />I have to wonder, though, if the last part of the movie is entirely real either, or more a matter of waking up from one dream into another. After all, at the engagement party we see the nameless Cowboy walking past in the background. To me that says: this is the real Diane, the real situation, but it's still a dream. For my money, the whole movie is a flash in Diane's mind at the moment of... Well, I won't spoil that at least. <br />In fact the thing that most moved me about this film was the human story. I'd never thought of Lynch as caring all that much about his characters, but here he does. In her dream Diane is an innocent ingenue, starry-eyed at Hollywood, a natural genius as an actress, astounded and transformed by her unexpected love for another woman. The real Diane is a hard-bitten, strung-out, murderous lesbian and a failed actress. And in Diane's dream if not in reality, her lover survives the murder attempt on Mulholland Drive---and Diane is her savior rather than her killer. Naomi Watts is justly celebrated for what she did with that role. It's overwhelming.<br />I've only seen it, oh, three or four times. I crave more. For a while it seemed to be running on the Mystery channel every other night. Probably a good idea. I used to feel Lynch was a bit too much into weirdness for the sake of weirdness--see \\"Eraserhead.\\" Here he's stranger than ever, but every bit of it has a point, contributes to the unfolding of a real human tragedy however bizarre. If Lynch can build on this, he'll be one of the very greats.
0156027321|5.0|Very interesting, thought provoking. The last chapters of the book will make you think about many things you might have never paid attention to...<br />Fun to read and I would say a must read for people who like to dream.. ;)
B0000TB01Y|5.0|This is truly a remarkable recording and show.  I won't go into much detail, becuase many others have, but you'll notice a running theme through most of the reviews, that this is an awesome soundtrack showcasing some serious Broadway talent!  If you like musicals, you'll enjoy this, believe me!
B0002858YS|3.0|When I heard &quot;Somebody Told Me&quot;, I was quite excited particularly by the fact that this is a well written song with a catchy hook. When I bought this CD, I really wanted to be blown away because it happens so infrequently with music these days (unlike the 80's that was full of awesome college radio), but I wasn't. My sense of this band is they have strong song writing components with the possibility to make really great melodic pop music, but as a whole it just isn't quite there. I feel there is undeveloped work here with the exception of a few songs. I also think the lyrics are a bit weak- even for an 80's influenced band. I hope with future albums this band develops to its full potential. I am really looking forward to see what they do next.
B000002N2Z|4.0|This is metal. I don't get why some of the reviews call it emo? It isn't, this is real metal at its best. It is raw and unfiltered. It sounds very hard though! Note: This is a debut and not a lot of bands sound the same after their debut CD. So take that warning when you buy this CD!
B00000099Y|5.0|I absolutely love this cd. I love maynard's voice. I love long songs and tool make great ones. This album is nothing but great musicians making some of the best possible music ever(and i mostly listen to rap). My favorite songs on this are Eulogy and Hooker With A Penis. Go buy this right away.
B000084T18|1.0|Wow! Doesn't he look hard on that front cover! I'm quivering in my boots!... yeah so here's some reasons why 50 Cent and rap music is crap:<BR> They don't write their own lyrics and if they do they fail.<BR> They have rubbish easy beats in the background to add 'effect'.<BR> They usually get loads of people featuring on songs so they don't have to show off their wonderful talent.<BR> They don't play any instruments whatsoever.<br /> If you disagree with those points then you obviously don't know what music you're listening to.<BR> 50 Cent and his 'hommies' are just posers who have no talent at all. But..... if you're interested in listening to talented heavy metal then try out Opeth or Metallica. Rap sucks.
B0000TLA9G|5.0|I Dont really get into older rock, nothing against old rock, it just aint really my cup of tea, but then there is guns n roses. They are 1 of few old rock i like, some more i like are black sabbath, jimi hendrix, led zeppelin, ozzy osbourne, anthrax, metallica, iron maiden, and alice cooper-that is it. I just bought this cd today and i love it. My favorite songs are You Could Be Mine and Knockin On Heaven's Door. I suggest you pick this up, you wont regret it.
B000000H5K|5.0|In the year 1996, the Brazilian Metal Gods Sepultura (Grave) decided to make something different. They set out to invent something called Tribal Metal, which they had previously tampered with on Chaos A.D. (1993). Tribal Metal consists of attitude, anger (most of the time), a variety of ideas, tribal drums/percussion and of course knowledge of your Roots. It was something that managed to bring people together; with the exception of those that stick to Beneath the Remains and Arise (good albums) and refuse to evolve fearing its selling out or whatever.       Max, Andreas, Igor and Paulo Jr. ventured into the Brazilian forest to spend time with the Xavantes Tribe in which they recorded the live song Itsari. The influence of what they did shows throughout the album. This results in not being the average Metal Album however. There is also some slight punk influence/atmosphere of rage on Cut-Throat, Ambush, and Endangered Species not to mention the short thrash song Dictatorsh*t. There is a small Acoustic song by Andreas Kisser called Jasco. Roots doesn't focus on Guitars as much like they did in previous releases. The amount of solos diminishes although doesn't become absent. The solos just are not that great but they don't drag the songs down.       Instead the album focuses on the Tribal drums of Igor Cavalera. I myself am a drummer/percussionist and highly enjoy weird sounds, different styles among other things. An example would be that Igor uses a rusted Propane tank and a Djembe on the kick@ss song known as Dusted, Or the Berkimbau that Max uses on Attitude. (one of the best songs) Sadly, though Max has overplayed the usage of the Berimbau after the 3rd time of doing so in Soulfly.       The people that I spoke of earlier that stick to the Sep albums from 1985-1991 often accuse Roots of being a sellout album and slander it with it being &quot;Nu-Metal&quot;. Sorry but it isn't &quot;Nu Metal&quot;. Nu-metal involves Metal with Rap/Hip Hop influences (none here clearly) and no solos at all. Like I said earlier, while the solos have diminished and are not as impressive, they are still here and it concentrates more on the drums and overall sound. Max was still pissed off here like he was in Beneath the Remains or Arise or Choas A.D., it's just how it is carried out. For one thing he swears a lot more, but not on the overdone level of Soulfly's &quot;Primitive&quot; and fortunately a PA Sticker is not present (I hate those friggin' things). Despite this I can understand why it is labeled by those as Nu Metal because of appearance of Jon Davis (Korn) and it being produced by Ross Robinson (Korn's first 2 Albums and other things) and even the Appearance of DJ Lethal. But this was back in 1996. The abominable Limp Bizkit didn't exist until the next year.       The song Lookaway is written by Jon Davis and features him (you can hear him better on the remix) but at the same time we have Mike Patton to settle things out. The song is eerie and actually in a way, it keeps the album fresh. Tracks 5-7 may be considered filler by some, but the mood of Lookaway changes everything and grabs your attention. Don't worry it's not a rap song. I'll confess, I like Korn and very, VERY few other Nu-Metal bands, but other then the bizarre lyrics, this is not a Korn song and once again I'll bring up the fact that you can hardly hear Jon at all on this version.       Roots was the best Tribal Metal Album that Max ever made and sadly it gets worse and worse with each Soulfly album. The effort and thought that went into Roots is part of makes it so good. They worked their a**'s off. Every song has its greatness. This was the last album with Max Cavelera who left during the Roots Tour when his Stepson was killed and there were a few tension within the band. However I can't help but feel that maybe it was for the best. I could easily see that if Max didn't leave that it may be a combination of Soulfly and the modern Sepultura. Sepultura will always leave their mark and leave us memories as one of the greatest metal acts in history. Buy this album for this is the true Sepultura (With Max). I hope this was helpful.
0679745203|3.0|The English Patient is a book that is truly stirring and memorable but poorly written. The author uses words so odd that, although I understood them, they seem designed to confuse the reader rather then paint a better picture of the lives of each of the 4 major characters. The author also seems to have difficulty deciding which character he wants the book to focus on: whether Hana, the nurse; David, the thief; Kip, the sapper; or the mysterious &quot;English patient.&quot; Hana, David, and Kip are not described in detail or well, and so they are all easily forgettable, but the English patient's story of his life in the desert before and during the Second World War is excellent, a &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; romance that is easily the best part of the book. Unfortunately, to get to these good parts, you must sit through 140 some pages of dull love scenes between Hana and various men. Huzzah.<br />Even with these faults, the English Patient's tale of its titular character is very good, but I wish it had gotten a fairer treatment. It is the kind of book you must reread every few years, simply because it is so difficult to understand.

B0001ZX0OW|2.0|Bad accents, a ridiculous pile-up of convenient coincidences, unconvincing speeches, are not redeemed by a strong performance from Sean Penn.  This movie falls apart while you're watching it, and then really really really outlasts its welcome.  Laura Linney's Lady Macbeth scene is laughable.  Can you say overrated?  Eastwood has directed far better movies.  All I can imagine is that whatever made sense in this story was left out of the screenplay and might be found in the book.
B000001FDQ|5.0|Yngwie Malmsteen is one of the few legends alive today.  Yngwie, Steve Vai and Carlos Santana to name a few.  Among the unfortunate dead, Randy Rhoades, Jimi Hendrix and Cobain.  Whoever said you can't feel classical music is a fool.  You can feel any type of music if you try.  Guitarist will come and go but the few listed above, especially Randy Rhoades and Yngwie Malmsteen, their music and styles will live on!
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Still wondering why music is dead? Because creatures in garb with no talent(like this girl called Britney Spears), plus a marketing and media hype have all killed it. These wannabe artists happen to be the rave these days. So if you wanna get a record deal, you think you look like a Barbie doll with absolutely no talent, can make some cheesy, boring and uninspiring music, you've just about got it made. Ask Britney,Justin Timberlake, Eminem, Ashanti, NSYNC and some of those jokers out there who have subjected us to undue torture we have to be faced with when we listen to radio or watch tv. Is this the future?
B0001Z52RU|5.0|More like an intricate and complex web of relations, this films deals with self-sacrifice and losing the one you love - if you had the ability to change the past.  I watched the DVD director's cut first and can only re-state that it is VERY macabre and frightening and holds a totally different mood than the theatrical version.  It's sheer terror, moving into time and space and other elements outside the realm of sci/fi time travel.  SCAN this first before showing it to the kids:  it overwhelmed me and I'm 30.  However, the theatrical version is too sunny and predictable and doesn't bring forth any raw emotion.  As a writer, I preferred the chills and the tears that came with the director's cut.  If you like things wrapped up, go for the theatrical cut.  I am a devotee of these types of horror/sci-fi/drama pieces so naturally I watched the commentary immediately after.  I thought I had the plot unlocked, but I just needed a little help.  No assistance needed with the theatrical version which is certainly more appropriate for older teens.  Overall, I do not know any of the cast members or their work.  I just thought this was on the same scale as Sixth Sense with Bruce Willis and Seven with Brad Pitt.  If you liked those, try The Butterfly Effect.  The DVD is worth the price.
0786198494|5.0|No one needs my naive commentary on this witty, charming, and rewarding stalwart of the canon; plenty has been written about Austen's novels. I merely wanted to report that the reader, Nadia May, does an excellent job here. I enjoyed all ten CDs!
0316666343|3.0|Okay, okay, call me the bruised author working on her second and unpublished novel, with no representation, and you'll call me jealous.  Not true.  I worship White Oleander and Fall on Your Knees, She's Come Undone - all amazing and inspiring titles to keep any struggling author going . . .<br />The Lovely Bones starts off riveting - I cannot put down the novel.  Looking through the eyes of Susie, I become Susie - a victim of rape and murder at the age of 14 in 1973.  No mystery here - the death, although gory, and murderer are announced by page 3.  George Harvey is a well-planned serial killer with a lot of thought into his character.  Sister Lindsey feeds off her sister's death by moving too fast with sex, love, control, and over-achievement.  A breathless character, mature, self-loving.  I respect her.  Mother has an affair and pays the ultimate price.  She seems happy to be rid of family life during her estrangement and I was sorry to see her back in the Salmon's life:  even if this made Susie happy in her heaven.  Fellow girlfriend in this self-made transitional heaven for \\"victims\\" who haven't moved on from watching and grieving earth, Holly, is violently underdeveloped as if Sebold forgot to amplify her character and said, \\"well, my hands are tired from typing.  enough said.\\"  Same thing with Franny, the heaven's school counselor - where dis she go to?  Did she move on?  I resented bittely the character of Grandma Lynn who enjoyed a drink and a cackle and makeup and being \\"starved down\\" whose surviving granddaughter needs some \\"hollowing out\\" and to lose the \\"baby fat\\" since \\"baby fat\\" connotates ugly rather than young, fresh-faced, girlish, feminine, or soft.  I mean, Susie is nothing but bones!!  Would Grandma Lynn like to dress her up like a stick doll!  Hey, in these era of anorexia and bulimia - this should have been edited down.  A terrible and unrealistic character.  Which brings me to say that:  my first novel ran 897 pages.  Don't do that unless youare Wally Lamb with I Know this Much is True.  He succeeded.  I am not afraid to stop this novel at about 300 pages.  Obviously, Sebold was afraid to.  As a published writer of short stories, fiction, and poetry, I could absolutely SENSE that she had ideas to wrap this story up completely and then - CHANGED HER MIND!  Onto Ruth Connors and the supernatural elements that take this book from tangible to a dream.  It's a sad collapse of an exquisite work of fiction.  I didn't care about Ruth or her abilities, not did I believe Susie could inhabit her bod and return to earth.  Is this fiction of sci/fi???<br />Overall, it's solid quality.  Oprah didn't pick this one, I wonder why?  The writing is top-notch and the concept is well, rare and unusual.  If you want an atypical summer read, go for it.  It falls a bit flat, but as a whole, it earned a place on my bookshelf.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|Avril had no reason to attack Britney Spears the way that she did.  Avril did this for marketing purposes, she used Britney to and the anti Britney to gain a major fanbase.  I in no way a fan of Britney but I at least respect her for not saying anything bad about Avril.  I mean Avril has absoulaty not nothing to complain about, she former writers and producers wrote and produced 98% of the songs on she last album.  She sold 14 worldwide.  Avril also has a nasty attitude, and is not very articulate.  She is go back to school and learn how to hold a conversation becasue not Isolate herself from the rest of society.<BR>Once again Avril should count her blessing everyday, because a lot of people would love to be in her place.<BR>Another thing it really upsets me that whenever a new pop rock female act comes out, they are compared to Avril.  This is upseting because are their own persons, and they didn't have to say anything bad about another person to help gain there fanbase.  They are really respectful of other artist and do there own thing.
B0001WTUH6|5.0|I loved this movie. However, if you're someone who has to have every nuance of the plot spelled out for them, its probably going to get on your nerves. You have to think in order to get the connections and understand the implications of events. Overall, its a great story and I look forward to the sequal (and prequal).

Rather than looking at someone's fabricated track record one could simply ask have you read Taleb, and understood him....<br /> The answer was and is far more important than any &quot;random&quot; series of returns you show someone..<br />Happily, Taleb has not stopped thinking, and the new edition goes even further in exploring the basic roots of how we cope with randomness...<BR>  The second edition should give those interested a starting point on how to integrate the new &quot;findings&quot; from both Behavioral Finance and the even more exotic Neuroeconomics.....

B0001W8Q9Y|5.0|After a long hiatus Marillion is back in true form.  Marbles finally showcases the talent of the band.  Hogarth's vocals, Rothery's guitar work, and the blend of great music comes through in this album.  I have been a fan for 16 years and was just about to give up on them after the last several CDs.  Fortunately I gave them one more try!  I can't wait until them come to the US in the fall.
B000002UAU|2.0|This album sucks. It's a total rip off of Pet Sounds. What, did Ringo write the whole thing. They should have kept Stu Sutcliffe. Enough Sitar already. Plus, what the heck are marshmallow skies. Who is this Mr. Kite guy anyway, and what posseses him to waltz with a horse. Really, now.
B00005JMYG|5.0|I found this movie to be absolutely delightful, FAANTAASTIC!!!  Will Ferrell in my eyes can do no wrong and he comes through again with this hilarious take on the underground news achorman society of the 1970's.  This movie is Will Ferrell comedy at its purest so beware it may be a little over some peoples heads if you are not a true Ferrell fan. This is not like his other roles where he was an actor in someone elses movie this is straight from his head and the comedy is a little off the wall but hilarious.  There are some supporting characters that are also great such as the weather man, whose completely idiotic ramblings are great, especially his statement about bears attraction to certain feminine issues.  Also be ready for some great camios.  So in closing for those who feel Ferrell being Ferrell is pure genius, see this movie immediately and stay classy planet earth.

B00008S2VG|2.0|News flash: Madonna's past life was weird and empty, but now everything is straightened out and life is good. Or so is the message of \\"American Life,\\" Madonna's first bona fide flop. Don't expect to be shocked -- it's mere a slapdash collection of lackluster pop songs.<br />The opening title track is an aimless spattering of electronica, laced with Madonna informing us that she lives the American dream (in England, no less). Then it's the forgettable electronica ode to \\"Hollywood,\\" a sneer at the world and herself in \\"I'm So Stupid,\\" the embarrassing \\"Love Profusion,\\" and the pretty but horribly self-indulgent \\"Easy Ride.\\" The sole saving grace is \\"Die Another Day,\\" a catchy dance-pop tune.<br />Don't be fooled by her faux-Che Guevera cover, the posing with a machine gun, the controversial music video, or a handful of throwaway four-letter words. Despite claiming to have an \\"extreme point of view,\\" Madonna is resolutely tame in this outing. And tame doesn't suit her -- when she raps \\"I drive my Mini Cooper/And I'm feeling super-duper!\\" it's hard not to wince.<br />Madonna's voice has never been that good, and she can't cover up the lyrical shortcomings of \\"American Life.\\" Her songs are trite at best, preaching against materialism and containing lyrics like \\"They couldn't take my loneliness/I couldn't take their phoniness.\\" Perhaps worst of all is Madonna's juvenile rap, boasting about her three nannies, yoga, kabbalah, butler, jet, and ogling the \\"hotties\\" at her workouts. \\"I'm drinking a soy latte/I get a double shot-tay/it goes through my body/And you know I'm satisfied!\\" she raps happily. Really? After hearing that, I'm not.<br />And the musicianship of this album is, in a word, sloppy. The electronica is hasty-sounding, often random beeps and blips pasted together over the acoustic music. The guitar riffs aren't bad, but they definitely aren't good. In songs like \\"X-Static Process,\\" it's hard to even pay attention to the generic, meandering melody.<br />Despite her abandoned \\"American Life\\" music video (would they have included the soy lattes?), Madonna's latest is a tame, hasty collection of half-baked, forgettable pop songs. Only the mismatched Bond theme is worth your time.her abandoned \\"American Life\\" music video (would they have included the soy lattes?), Madonna's latest is a tame, hasty collection of half-baked, forgettable pop songs.

It failed entirely to stimulate the right side of my brain (that's the RIGHT side, dummy). But it has done a fine job of stabilising an erstwhile wobbly coffee table.<br />I'm all in favour of debunking the myths on which organised religions are built. But the only myths this airport trash debunks are that the author is capable of (a) writing literature and (b) getting his facts straight.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I've been listening to SLIPKNOT since their first cd \\"Mate, Feed, Kill, Repeat.\\" That album is what got me into shock rock. Then the band split up for a couple of years and some of the members went their own seperate ways. Then in 1998 the SLIPKNOT we know and love came out. With their first CD \\"Slipknot\\" was completely deffening at the time. When \\"IOWA\\" came out, I was so hooked on SLIPKNOT that I would never leave the house with either one of the CD's. When \\"Vol. 3 The Subliminal Verses\\" came out, I thought that the CD was ok. That's until I listened to it all. Corey's Vocals (#8) went into a whole new direction. Joey (# ) and Chris' (#3) drumming is actually playing instead of their deffening pounding. This CD is a must have. If you love the 'KNOT, then you MUST BUY THIS CD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005JMYG|4.0|Oh my gosh... what a hilarious movie!!  I could not stop laughing throughout the entire film.  Will Ferrell was funny but the guy on his news crew were even funnier.  The story is about Ron Burgundy (Ferrell).  He is the top-rated anchorman in San Diego in the '70s. When feminism marches into the newsroom in the form of ambitious newswoman Veronica Corningstone (Applegate), Ron is willing to play along at first-as long as Veronica stays in her place, covering cat fashion shows, cooking, and other \\"female\\" interests. But when Veronica refuses to settle for being eye candy and steps behind the news desk, it's more than a battle between two perfectly coiffed anchor-persons... it's war.  Must See!!!!
B00008MLSH|4.0|Anna Netrebko is one of the many young singers gathering attention from the opera world.  She is graced with physical beauty, acting skills, and a well-schooled voice.  She sings beautifully and with intelligence. So what is missing?  Perhaps it is the repertoire on this disc,  or the miking, or the rush to get this recording on the market. But for all the positives there is a sameness in sound from aria to aria, beautiful as that sound is.  There is also a tendency to spread the pitch on the high notes, a neglect of pianissimo, traits not unfamiliar in the Russian Opera Houses.  These are not things that cannot change, and from the basic gifts of this young beauty, it would seem that they probably will. She is quite showy!  Meanwhile, for an opera arias disc by a lyric soprano, this is a good one.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|This cd is a very fresh change for Slipknot.They have matured very much since &quot;Iowa&quot;.That cd was mostly brutal aggression.While I've loved everything that Slipknot has done,this cd is very,VERY good.Corey Taylor has gone a new way with his voice,using much more singing and a different kind of scream from his former deep brutal kind.Joey actually got more technical with his drumming,adding complicated rythms and not only relying on fast pounding.All in all,this cd should be in any true metal fan's library!
B00005JMFQ|5.0|With an all-star cast and slogan as &quot;The Ultimate Romantic Comedy&quot;, it seemed like &quot;Love Actually&quot; was destined to be a flop. After all, the film has multiple storylines, dozens of main characters, and a first-time director. However, Richard Curtis delivers a totally unique movie that is heart-warming, funny, and incredible!      The movie is, simply put, about relationships. As Hugh Grant's voiceover states at the beginning of the film: &quot;Husbands and wives, fathers and sons, boyfriends, girlfriends, old friends. I've got a sneaky feeling that if you look for it, you'll find that love actually is all around.&quot; The film makes its way through the lives of many different characters and their experiences of love. And, like the movie itself, the stories are woven together in a seamless tapestry of emotion.      The performances by everyone in the film are incredible. Liam Neeson plays a touching step-dad to Thomas Sangster's Sam, while Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman make the perfect married couple. Hugh Grant delivers a sparkling performance as the Prime Minister, while Colin Firth once again smoulders as a heartbroken writer. Kiera Knightly is refreshing as a new bride, and Laura Linney adds some American charm. Bill Nighy's hilarious performance as former rock and roller Billy Mack unites all of these tales. Other stars in more &quot;minor&quot; roles include Billy Bob Thorton, Rowan Atkinson, January Jones, Denise Richards, and Claudia Schiffer.       The first time I saw the film, I was impressed by its storytelling, continuity, and beauty. After several DVD watchings, I'm still in awe of how great of a movie it is. &quot;Love Actually&quot; is incredible, actually!

Just because he isn't popular, doesn't mean he doesn't have any taste when it comes to music and movies.

It starts out very intriguing--both the physical motorcycle journey, and the narrarator's discussion of technology and art.  Then, when we get up into &quot;high country,&quot; I found myself completely lost.  I have a bachelor's degree in English, so I think of myself as fairly intelligent.  But perhaps it is like his analogy to reading Walden: you have to pause after every sentence and let it set in.  It's just that if I did that, it would take me years to get through this book.  Some wonderful ideas, but this book is definitely not light reading.
B00004SV6S|5.0|Just when we thought Heavy metal and Iron Maiden were slowly dying, life gave us Brave New World, the album that features the triumphant return of singer Bruce Dickinson and guitarist Adrian Smith. The classic line-up that produced classics like Number of the beast, Piece of mind, Powerslave, Somewhere in time and the best album of all-time 7th son of a 7th son, was back plus Janick Gers who replaced Smith in the realy 90's.<br />This album is simply brilliant and proved that good music can still be made despite the horrible decade that was ending (the nineties). Here is a review of all the songs on the album :<br />1- Wickerman : Maiden is back ! Great opener. Very near the quality of Aces high and Moonchild. 10/10<BR>2- Ghost of the navigator : Very nice follow-up. Brings a new dimension to the traditionnal Maiden. The riff is very similar to Ozzy's I don't know. 9/10<BR>3- Brave New World : Beautiful song. Bruce's voice is stronger than ever. 10/10<BR>4- Blood brothers : Another Steve Harris classic. 9/10<BR>5- The mercenary : A fast rocker that, even though, is not a classic, does the job. 8,5/10<BR>6- Dream of mirrors : A &quot;new&quot; Maiden kind of song. A great epic. Bruce's voice is almost over the edge. 9/10<BR>7- Fallen angel : One of the reasons we love Adrian Smith, a good rocker with a great solo. 9/10<BR>8- Nomad : A great epic with a wonderful instrumental break. This song could fit easily on Piece of mind. 9/10<BR>9- Out of the silent planet : A fresh new Maiden song with a great acoustic intro. 9/10<BR>10- The thin line between love and hate : The weakest song on the album. Some parts are very good, some are just OK. 7,5/10<br />Overall, the gift that die hard Maiden fans didn't expect. The band is stronger than ever, more mature, and Bruce's voice never sounded better. Also, the addition of Adrian Smith gives a boost to the quality of the solos that were a bit sloppy since his departure. If you liked Maiden in the 80's, buy this album, it's thesame quality transposed in the second millenium.
B000002UAX|5.0|PLEASE PAY NO ATTENTION TO THE HATERS AND BUY THIS CD FULL OF INCREDIBLE MUSIC YOU WILL EVER HEAR.FIVE STARS.
B0000251VZ|5.0|Powerslave was the breakthrough album in America for Iron Maiden. With such classics as Aces High, 2 mins to 12:00, Powerslave and Rime of the Ancient mariner there's no wonder why. The quality of the production is unsurpassed and, musically, the guys went to the maximum of their capabilities.<br />1-Aces high : The ultimate album opener. Fast and furious with a killer chorus. A masterpiece that is just uncomparable. 10/10<BR>2-2 mins to 12:00 : It takes a special song to follow Aces high. 2 minutes does it great. 9,5/10<BR>3-Losfer words (Big `Orra) : A very melodic instrumental piece. 8,5/10<BR>4-Flash of the blade : A super fast-paced rocker. Very solid. 8,5/10<BR>5-The duellists : Very unknown and underrated song. The guitars and bass are just amazing. 9/10<BR>6-Back in the village : In my opinion, the most underrated song of Iron Maiden. Technically, their best ever. 9,5/10<BR>7-Powerslave : You can almost feel that you're in Egypt !  Adrian Smith solo is full of emotion. After hearing this song, you will be a slave to the power of Maiden. 10/10<BR>8-Rime of the ancient mariner : The best song of all time. A 13 minutes song of that intensity and excellence is a \\"tour de force\\". The masterpiece of all masterpieces. Bottom line. 10/10<br />For some, it's the ultime Maiden album, for others the middle part is weak. The songs need time to grow but they are brilliant. Maybe not my favourite but near the top. A must.

B0000BYM3K|5.0|After the amazing Brave New World, Iron Maiden comes back with the excellent album Dance of death. Although this new release is not as a masterpiece as BNW, it's still classic Maiden that has nothing to envy from their past glory.<br />1-Wildest dreams : Catchy opener, but not the strongest song on the album. 9/10<BR>2-Rainmaker : Pop metal at his best. Very catchy but not cheesy at all. 10/10<BR>3-No more lies : On every album you have a Steve Harris song that is around 7 minutes long that kills. That's the one. 9,5/10<BR>4-Montségur : Bruce Dickinson at his best. Very heavy and the lyrics are probably in the top 5 of all Maiden songs. Brilliant. 10/10<BR>5-Dance of death : Very theatrical and dramatic, an opus that only Iron Maiden has the recepy. It flirts with past masterpieces such as rime of the ancient mariner and 7th son. 10/10<BR>6-Gates of tomorrow : Very good song. The backing vocals of Bruce over his own voice on the chorus is brilliant. It brings the song from OK to very good. Not a filler. 9/10<BR>7-New frontier : Nicko McBrain first writing contribution ever. And a good one. Again, not a filler, very catchy. 9/10<BR>8-Paschendale : Another epic about war that is custom Maiden but with a new structure. 9,5/10<BR>9-Face in the sand : A very good song that takes time to grow in you. There is a beautiful solo by Adrian Smith. 8,5/10<BR>10-Age of innocence : Same as face in the sand. There is a very heavy part that rocks. 8,5/10<BR>11-Journeyman : Maiden goes acoutic. Why not ? It's refreshing and very good. This is no cheap ballad like we heard too many in the 80's. This a mature song by a mature band. 9/10<br />Overall, not BNW, but close. I only have two cons about this album. First of all, it's a little bit long. Maybe face in the sand or age of innocence could have been put on a B-side. But then again, they deserve their place on the album. Secondly, the quality of the solos (Dave Murray and Janick Gers) is very average. They are some time repetitiveand way too fast. Please learn from your buddy Adrian. Buy this album, you won't regret it !

B00004TJKB|5.0|In 1993 , director Harold Ramis genius of dark comedies like ''Analyze This'' casted Bill Murray as Phil Connors in this dark but mostly enjoyable movie named GroundHog Day.<br />Bill Murray plays Phil Connors a weatherman, who covers everything from weather to Ground Day. Phil isn't happy with his life, in fact he realizes that he is repeating the same routine over and over again. From work in the morning,to<BR>talking to the annoying Ned Ryanser( Stephen Tobolowsky), while listening to Sonny and Cher in the morning to covering the stupid GroundHog Day, Phil is repeating the same day over and over again. Of course the irony here as done by the plot, is that he is the only that knows it. It's like an episode the ''Twilight Zone'' (which I reviewed too on other sites). Eventually Phil has a mental breakdown in which he plans to do whatever he wants. He comes completely unglued when realizing how wasted his life had become, and thus wants to change it.<br />I use the term breakdown because well Phil isn't exactly a nice guy, he's arrogant and obnoxious. We hardly sympathize with this guy, much less that he is miserable.<BR>However, the point the movie makes is the guy realizes he has been wasting his life away and wants to change it, although Phil's change doesn't go ahead smoothly.<br />He drives reckless around the train tracks, gets arrested, steals a bagfull of money from a couple of dumb cops, charms his way into sleeping with a beautiful young girl and yet finds out that he still isn't happy. Until he puts the moves on Rita (Andy McDowell), his producer. McDowell is the few actresses that I know that has limited acting potential but her beautiful presence can convey some emotions making her sympathetic.<br />However, in order to get close to Rita, Phil has to get info on her likes and dislikes from her friends. This angle in the movie, really made me a little sick, because even we are suppose to sympathize with Phil, he hasn't really changed all that much. Rita,eventually finds out Phil's motives and slaps him in the face, and telling him to get lost. LOL No surprise there, in fact Rita's action sums up my argument that Phil hasn't really changed all that much despite his aim to not repeat the same day, he is still repeating his same behavioral patterns.<br />Phil though in order to impress her and to change himself, starts doing bizarre, yet unreal things that get him attention and he does start to become nicer. This is where the movie gets ridiculous, because even though this is a comedy, I found the rest of the movie to be predictable, superficial, yet enjoyable<BR>Phil becomes a gifted ice sculpter (who knows where he learned this) as one scene, where his cutting a sculpture of an ice angel is shown. Then Phil saves a guy from choking to death, a kid from a falling tree and a host of other surprises. LOL<br />Yes Harold Ramis does go a bit over the top with this Phil guy, obviously a lot of the stuff he pulls of is almost impossible giving Phil's background, but Ramis is again trying to show the point (although laughingly bad) that Phil is changing. He now has a heart and will do anything to be with this nice woman and of course by Phil doing this he has filled that empty void that he had when he was repeating the same unfulling routine of covering that stupid Groundhog Day in Pennsylvania.<br />Ramis is actually a buddy of Murray going back to the old days of their ''SCTV'' days, and ''Ghostbusters'' days, so these two talented comedian can pull the hijinks in the film with some realism.<br />Still though Ramis does do a good job of making us think about the movie and Phil itself and gives us that scary thought that we perhaps might end up like Phil, a shriveled, ugly man who has been repeating the same stupid routine yet doesn't have the capacity to see that this misery is at his own doing.<br />LOL
B000002HHB|3.0|WARNING: DO NOT OPERATE HEAVY MACHINERY AFTER INGESTING. I picked up the disk because of &quot;Carnival&quot;. Merchant's voice is so unique and haunting that I found entire album mesmerizing, though a little bit repetitive. Be warned, you really should reserve listening to this album either late at night or on rainy, overcast days. There is not one up-tempo song on the entire disk, and some of the songs &quot;My Beloved Wife&quot;, for example are so damn depressing, I just don't understand how country music hasn't remade it yet?! Even though this is a slow album, the music is performed so well, it does not get boring. I can't believe this album is almost 10 years old now, and unlike disks by Jewel or Alanis, this music has aged well. &quot;Tigerlily&quot; still sounds fresh and unique today (Hell it should! With women in today's music scene, it's more about looking good in a belly-shirt, than singing well) it's a shame that Merchant all but vanished after &quot;Ophelia&quot;. But if you are in the mood to just mellow out some late evening, or want some soothing music in the background when you crack open a book, this is the perfect disk.
B0000214F2|5.0|The always delightful robin williams once again delivers a heartwarming performance in patch adams, a movie based on the actual real life character named Patch Adams who also wrote a novel about his experience. This is a great movie by good director tom shadyac and includes a great cast including williams and philip seymour hoffman as patch's friend mitch. <br />Williams stars as patch adams a guy who comes to work for a hospital with several patients who are either very ill or whose doctors have done little to improve their condition. adams though, knows that the way to improve their patients is not through medicine but through goodness and happiness. in adams case, he brings laughter and joy using an unusual brand of humor. <br />In several instances, adams dresses and acts like a clown complete with a red nose. He entertains the dying patients in the hospital with his gentle heart and breathes new life and hope into them. <br />''You treat a disease,   you win or lose, you treat a patient,   i'll guarantee you ll win'' that great lines is Adams philosophy toward treating patients. <br />He sees that one of the main reasons the doctors have failed in improving their patients conditions is because several of the doctors are cold-blooded and unfeeling. The doctors fail to get know their patients intimately and fail most of all to make their patients happy. several of william's colleagues a guy named mitch and a girl name annie are skeptical at first, but after witnessing the improvement in the patients, they see that adams is just what the doctor ordered. <br />However, not all the people in the hospital is happy with adams. The main boss of the hospital (obviously jealous with adams amazing ability to relate and bring joy the patients) wants adams to quit or be fired from the hospital. i liked this movie very much not only because of williams performance but because of the message. in today's age with greedy HMO's, high medical costs and unfeeling customers service, todays patients don't really get the high quality medical care. Many doctors are rude and impatient with the patients, Nurses fail to get there patients personally and so forth. <br />Of course not all Doctors and Hospitals are cold-blooded are bad, but it would stupid to say that all of them are good, because they are not. If you turn on the news, there's always a news segment chronicle the bad service of a hospital or doctor, or a lawsuit against both. <br />So the movie is very fact based. It's actually based on the 1970's real life events of  Hunter ''Patch'' Adams (Robin Williams), who founded the Gesundheit Clinic. <BR>Williams does his usual great heartwarming , comedic performance that only he can do. This is a very great film. If you work in the medical profession, you'll probably learn alot. <br />If you're a Williams fan, you'll love it.
B00006JL1Z|3.0|This 2 CD set includes all of the Fleetwood Mac's hits from albums &quot;Fleetwood Mac&quot; &amp; &quot;Rumours&quot; (Basically it contains the entire &quot;Rumours&quot; album, minus 2 tracks).<br />&quot;Tusk&quot;, &quot;Mirage&quot;, &quot;Tango in the Night&quot; are also represented well on this collection. I won't bother to go into every song and whether or not it should have been included in this set, but anything from &quot;The Dance&quot; should have been left off in place of the original. &quot;Big Love&quot;, the acoustic and whiny version presented here does not do the song justice. &quot;Go Insane&quot; I guess was a way for Buckingham to sneak in one of his solo hits onto a Mac album. It's also kind of sad to hear a band that was so original and inventive, go from songs like &quot;The Chain&quot; and &quot;Tusk&quot; to elevator pap like &quot;Skies the Limit&quot; and &quot;Paper Doll&quot;. I enjoy the early stuff, hits or not, but everything after &quot;Tango in the Night&quot; should have been left to the record store bargain bins. Instead of buying this, look for used copies of Mac's early albums, I've seen them listed for $5 and under, you could probably buy all of them for the price of this one collection.
B0001CCXY8|1.0|I was a huge cannibal corpse up to their last two albums, but lets face it, their not rewritting the same albums again and again, their rewritting the same three songs. I couldn't care less about their image or lyrics, the day I listen to metal for lyrics and depth will coincide with the day I have my brain removed. <BR> As for techinicality, these guys are a joke. This doesn't take true talent. They solo the same freakin scale again and again, and play mostly power cords and harmonics. Any one who thinks this takes true skill is either A) not a musician B) some one who has never studied anything other than death metal and Black sabbath tunes. <BR> They just need to give up or come up with something new. They've done nothing to stay fresh or interesting (unlike a band like Napalm Death). The music is about the the attitude and pure butt kicking riffs and these guys have niether.
B000002HH9|4.0|This album follows 'Wish' in the fact of leaving behind the gloomyness they were into in the marvellous 'Disintegration'. So now they explore many different kinds of musical 'moods' which makes this album unpopular because it's irregular and loose, but in a way it also brings a lot of hidden feelings we couldn't find before in the band. The incredible variety of this album makes me put it in the place of the 'odd' album almost every band has. And although some songs are weak, like 'Club America' and the dreadful last song, the worst I've ever heard from The Cure, there are some gems here.<br />The first song, 'Want' is very consistent and even the title seems to want to carry on with the 'Wish' album's concept. 'Trap' is a great rocker with outstanding guitar and drums work, and trademark desperate lyrics about an almost broken relationship. 'Jupiter Crash' is a very poetic song, 'Mint Car' gets to sound funny and happy, and has a strange magic based in the fact of how strange is hearing The Cure sound so happy.<br />'the 13th' is not a fav but its really exotic, a strange step into latin by a very European band. 'Drug' sounds exotic also because of the sitar and has the same beautiful sadness of 'To Wish Impossible Things' from the previous album.The rest of the songs is interesting and varied. It is so an interesting album full of different tracks, in which you will find your favourite depending on your own taste.
B0002D6JX2|4.0|Delta Goodrem, a girl who is quite different from other pop stars, she can sing most of the songs very well during live performance. I did watched one of her live performance of &quot;Born to Try&quot; in one of the Christmas Show in Sydney 2 yrs ago. <br />Her voice is powerful (even though not as powerful as Celine Dion) But she did sing very well, at least 85% as well as she did in her CDs. This is very different from other pop stars, who can only sing in the studio but barely sing well during live performance.<br />I am expecting her second release in December. I hope she would get a fully recovery from her disease.
B00005JKGZ|5.0|Meet Me in St Louis is one of the greatest musicals ever made! Combining the talent of Judy Garland and scene stealer Margaret O'Brian and wonderful songs Meet Me In St Louis is a treat for all!
B0002BO0AS|5.0|sick breakdowns and heavy ass riffs, you have to buy this CD to hear the brutality.... HARDCORE RULES!!!
B00029LNHS|5.0|This CD is great! All the songs I heard so far, are awesome. Fargie, Taboo, Will.i.am, and apl all have great and all have great voices. They wouldn't do bad as solo artists too. My favorite out of the 4 are Fergie and Taboo.
0451169514|5.0|This and The Stand are my two favorite books in all the world.  What can I say?  Masterful!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This CD is one of the best CDs I've bought. There should have a parental note on the cover of the CD because most of the songs talk about tings kids under 12 shouldn't listen to.
B0000039QA|5.0|Life After Death is the sophomore of the Late Notorious BIG. He showed maturity and growth in his skills and agenda. I previously believed Ready To Die was unsurmountable and nothing in the future could be better. He proved me wrong. Biggie Smalls is definitely the GREATEST MC OF ALL TIMES. Both of his albums are street classics which most consider in the top 10 hiphop classics of all times. Rest In Peace ma brother. Rap has never been the same without u.
B00006BTCA|3.0|I'm a bit of a dilettante when it comes to Interpol. I've had this album for ages, but the production and overly long song lengths have always kept me from really getting into it. The first four songs are obviously fantastic, but by then my tolerance has usually worn out and I'm unable to appreciate those which follow. Like so many of my fickle, reactionary peers, I too was forced to reassess the band in light of the recent leak of &quot;Antics&quot;, their forthcoming second album. Fortunately, those problems I have with &quot;Bright Lights&quot; have been addressed on &quot;Antics&quot;, and my enthusiasm for that album is such that I think I'm finally able to see some of the better aspects of this one. Surely, you don't need me to enumerate everything that the fans and critics have repeated at length for the last several years. Most of it is needless hyperbole anyway, but simply know that beneath the reverb is music of often remarkable beauty and passionate expression.
B0000399WI|5.0|It shows that the determination of the human spirit is invincible. It would make you realise that if there's no way then youve gotta make one for yourself or else . . .<BR>FREEMAN is always amazing. He definitely deserved the OSCAR. Robbins was spectular as well. Definitely in my top 5 not because of the storyline but because of how realistic they portrayed it. FREEMAN is amazing. WOW.
0786711647|4.0|I have read several of Ira Levin's books.  I have really liked them all.  Ira has a style of writing that engages you and makes you feel like a friend is telling you the story.  If you have seen &quot;A Place in the Sun&quot; (Elizabeth Taylor, Shelly Winters - a fabulous movie) then you pretty much are going to guess most of the story.  It doesn't differ too much from that, HOWEVER you will be engrossed absolutley even though you THINK you know what's going to happen :)  I was a little disappointed with the ending-the rest of the book was so exciting that the end seemed a little too neat and pretty - pretty.  I really don't think you can go wrong no matter which Ira Levin book you read (or can manage to find..most are no longer in print-part of the attraction).  Devious actions and thoughts make his characters memorable.  I think the real horror lies in his ability to take a mundane thing and find the dark side of it.
B0000039PW|5.0|&quot;Ready To Die&quot; is the debut classic from the King of New York aka Black Frank White. The 2Pac &amp; the BIG comparison in terms of MIC skills is unreasonable. Pac is definitely real poetic but not strong in lyrical ability. B.I.G. has only 3 albums and two of them are hiphop's classics. Born Again isnt a true portrayal of his skills. 2pac has 11 albums and Biggie is still considered parallel to him. I mean this shd definitely mean something. &quot;Warning&quot;, &quot;One More Chance&quot;, &quot;juicy&quot;, i mean there is no weak song on the album. His story was told in the best way possible. Definitely the best HIPHOP album of all times. READY TO DIE is an invincible masterpiece and would forever remain the most complete album of all times.
B00000I01A|5.0|When I was a little kid in like second grade around 86-87, I heard this album (on cassette, of course) via my older cousin. I was addicted to it immediately, borrowed it and crudely made a copy of it (putting two tape-recorders next to each other and using the built in mic to pick up the sound). I later got a real copy of the cassette as a Christmas present. I've often forgot about it since then, but I've never been sick of it. I finally bought the CD version 2 years ago.<br />This soundtrack is the one I remember most from any movie from the 80's. The only let-downs are the out of place laid-back adult contemporary track (the robot plays it while bringing Paulie his ice cream and beer) and the crappy 80's pop song (the robot is also guilty of this one, plays it while Rocky is washing his car...someone needs to shoot that f'ing robot). By all means stay away from tracks 3 and 8, they'll make you feel embarassed to be listening, even if you're alone. Everything else here is memorable. The James Brown track is also a little out of place, but it's acceptable since it was so heavily featured in the movie. Plus while listening to it I live out my fantasies of Drago punching James Brown. Hard.<br />Vince DiCola replacing what was mostly a Bill Conti score for the previous movies (and making a big transition from mostly orchestra to mostly synth) sounds very \\"80's\\" during the two instrumentals, but it doesn't matter since they are so outstanding.<br />Two Survivor songs and a few other great tracks from groups/artists we'd never heard of then and haven't heard from since top off an outstanding movie soundtrack.<br />So jump into your Lamborghini after dark, throw this sucker in your CD player, and drive really fast around town while reliving moments from your past films. Then go beat the crap out of some commies! And impatiently wait for Rocky VI.
0380820846|5.0|i must say i really enjoyed this book right from the beginning and it is a great read. Penolope and Colin are such a fine match. Colin is so charming and Penelope may act a bit shy in the first place but she turned as witty as any woman who doesn't make their debut in society much. All in all this book is great and I highly reccomend it to anyone who haven't got one of the taste from quinn's best book.
B00008S2VG|1.0|You are the quintessential diva and I know you can rest on your laurels if you need, but I must say that you should really think about giving us better songs without all the self-importance and preachiness (Oprah). Have you listened to Madison Park's \\"Boutique\\"? That is the album you should have recorded, not \\"American Life.\\"  No wonder this album went nowhere. YAWN!!
0375703764|4.0|It's very hard to follow along with the story. Throughout the book there are places where the writing is backwards, upside down, diagonally written across the page, even a few pages where you have to get a mirror and place it against the book to see what was written inside out. Not to mention you'll be really into a certain part of the book and then you see a footnote that goes on for 10 pages that has a small part to do with the story you're currently reading.  But my final word - It's a very interesting book, a good story, well developed characters, but be prepared before you pick this book up to read it, it's pleasure reading, but it's a lot of work too..
B00028HBKC|5.0|Now I know this is a very controversial film, but to all those people who think it's wrong to make this sort of film, it's to make people appreciate the life, death, and ressurection of Jesus. And also... for the person who says Jesus spoke English.. no he did not.. and he was without sin so he would not be with prostitutes... and third.. he was not on the cross for days.. hours is more like it. This film was made for people to appreciate their faith, not destroy it. I believe Mel Gibson made this film in all good heart.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Just noticed a negative review of this CD , and specifically, the score of WICKED right here amongst the &quot;regular&quot; listener reviews, by Robert Lopez, who is one of the Avenue Q creators(skip ahead two pages to read it)--Um, I feel it's kinda bad form, especially since you guys got all the Tony's for your cute but undeserving little show with it's sometimes clever lyrics but kiddy show music. Having heard many of your Theatreworks scores, Mr. Lopez, I would suggest you bask in your incredible luck right now and not publicly knock the far more sophisticated work of a musical theatre legend at his best. I have both your CD and the WICKED CD, but WICKED is the one that remains in my CD player for weeks on end! I'm guessing Avenue Q is your 15 minutes-- Sucka Sucka, indeed.
0385335482|4.0|We meet Becky Bloomwood here.  It's essential you play close attention to all of her life issues as nearly all are revisited in the sequels.  Becky brings to life the shopaholic in all of us, including our justification of purchases no man could ever understand.  I've read plenty of chick lit and have passed on much of it that seemed a waste of time.  Though you'll get frustrated at Becky from time to time, you can't help but love her.  This book is definitely worth taking the time to read.  Once you're hooked, you'll have to read the sequels.  You have to read them in order to fully appreciate them.
B00003CXXS|4.0|This movie is just pure fun. Thats all it is! The series is going to be if not already classic. See these films! Theyre a blast!
B00003ETJQ|1.0|If your interested in seeing what the film claims to be, &quot; a transcendently poetic, world-wide tour of the globe blah blah blah ..speaks  directly to the soul&quot;  - dont bother, it dosent happen. Instead you will find about 10 minutes of lovely scenery followed by lengthy film of poverty, cruelty and torture, including images of baby chicks having their beaks burnt off, graphic pictures of death camps and over-worked donkeys collapsing and dying (?!). Anyone who finds this &quot;visually stimulating&quot; needs psychiatric help. <BR>Fair enough if the film would actually indicate that your in for a visual experience depicting the apparent desperate state of the world, but there is no indication whatsoever of this pathetic morbidness in filmmaking, in fact it is offensive that the cover would suggest what lies within is even remotely &quot;beautiful&quot;.  Anyone who insists on watching it plse think twice before scaring your children with it - and if the film does have one worth-while message it is nothing to do with cinematography, its simply this  : Think twice where your next KFC wing came from! And is it worth it ?
B00007G1ZC|5.0|I first saw this on TV and taped it.  I was blown away by the visual beauty and terror of it all.  The last story about the windmills?  That is how I want my funeral.   Music and joy,  not tears and sadness.  We all die, but it is how we live that really matters.
B00008DDSC|5.0|&quot;I'm your secretary!&quot; A film that is trying to be smart and is made up of such material as S&amp;M is either hit or miss.  This is a hit.  <br />At the end, Lee, The Secretary, is empowered through submission, which could be quite a hard concept for one to wrap her mind around.  I guess it would be loosely similar to what the Catholic saints and martyrs love of God is like through denial of earthy pleasures and ascetic practices.  <br />Lee's evolution is a comic one shaped by her boss' influence. Both seemingly farcial and anemically serious, this is one to watch.
B00003CXCT|1.0|The special editions with the new digital effects were really pathetic.  The least George Lucas could do is release both versions (director's editions and the original theatrical cuts) in the same boxed set.  Spielberg did this with E.T., so what is George's excuse?
B00004Z459|1.0|This album is absolutely one of the most ridiculous musical efforts I have ever listened to.  This  is nothing more than a product manufactured for angry children who don't want to listen to music that is actually challenging.  The subject matter is trite, all the scratching is silly, the entire thing is overproduced, it sound like it was sung by a robot.  There is not a single shred of rawness on this entire album.  It's a joke.  Even posers know this is stupid.
B0001O3YD0|5.0|Sci/fi horror stories. You really don't expect such charatcer development in these types of movies, but this one does an excellent job, from start to finish. This is definitely not a B movie, not by a long shot.<br />You find out for example that the bad guy is not always the bad guy. In the crash sequence after all the dust settles and Johns finds an empty cryo sleep tube and his gun missing, it's found on the floor under a dangling Riddick. Now if Riddick was such a bloodthirsty bad guy, he would have taken the gun and shot Johns and been done with it. This is the second interesting development in the film, and gives you a nice window into the character of Riddick.<br />The first interesting development is the moral dilemna during the landing/crash of the ship, in which Fry tries to eject all the passengers.<br />The third interesting development is the assuming of Riddick's guilt in the death of Zeke, for which no one has apologized yet.<br />I've rarely seen such a depth in chracters in the scifi genre. All of the characters go through some deep changes under the pressure of the struggle to survive. Check out the expressions on the faces of the actors, and the dialogue, excellent job, without overacting or forcing.<br />The special effects are good, and they don't overwhelm the story. The plot is good, and the suspense stays with you up until the very end, building and ebbing throughout the film.<br />I wish they'd have had a bigger budget for this one, but if they had they'd have probably overloaded on the special effects.<br />Overall, I would give this an excellent rating as a movie buff.
B00005ASHM|5.0|A glowing and impossibly warm sort of magic fills your soul as you listen to Pet Sounds, and amazing beauty seems to envelope you, embrace you. Pet Sounds is the sound of a man baring his soul, a beautiful sound that is fragile and innocent as well as hard and dissilusioned.<BR>Brian Wilson grew up on Pet Sounds, and finally came into the genius for which he is now known. Gone are the endless references to surfing, cars, and superficial love. The lyrics here are deep and powerful, emotional on levels I never knew existed. The oppening song &quot;Wouldn't it be Nice&quot; is an incredibly passionate song of love, in which Wilson yearns for an affair he cannot have, because alas, he is to young. The song gets you caught up in the emotion and serves as a perfect template for the rest of the album.<BR>Every song is also an instantly memorable classic. &quot;Don't Talk (Put Your Head on My Shoulder)&quot; is tuneful and sweet, and has a magestic, lilting, chorus that always brings a smile to my face. &quot;That's Not Me&quot; tells the story of an innocent young man swept up by his hopes and dreams, and his eventual coming of age. &quot;I Know There's An Answer&quot; has an epic chorus line. &quot;Caroline No&quot; is a sweet and tragic story of the end of adolescent innocence and the harshness of the adult world.<BR>But what truly makes Pet Sounds brilliant is the music. Every single song is a veritible symphony, with multitudes of instruments and notes that rise to castles in the sky. The music sets the tone perfectly. It is low and lamentful on the sadder songs, apologetic and hopeful on songs of regret, and uplifting and epic on songs of happiness. The music of Pet Sounds can sweep you up in overwelming emotions and take you on a journy through every passionate feeling there is. It's definatley a ride worth taking.
B0000CAQ27|5.0|I am a huge fan of almost anything that is rock and I'm so glad Pink broke out of her pop shell, this CD is definately rockier than the previous two which dont waste your money on...<br />1. TROUBLE is the first single off the album, very good song<br />2. GOD IS A DJ is the second single, kind of a feel-good vibe<br />3. LAST TO KNOW - I love this song, funny in a way, great chorus, she's the only one who could've pulled this one off<br />4. TONIGHT'S THE NIGHT is kind of a party song, very fun to listen to<br />5. OH MY GOD (FEAT. PEACHES) is Pink's sex song, kind of a rock-hip hop feel...like this one<br />6. CATCH ME WHILE I'M SLEEPING is similar to Miserey on Missundaztood and is a song that makes you go to sleep :-P<br />7. WAITING FOR LOVE is a song that shows how she can really sing good...<br />8. SAVE MY LIFE is such a sad song, I really like this song, and I dont know why<br />9. TRY TOO HARD - and so the true rock begins...<br />10. HUMBLE NEIGHBORHOOD is definately old-school rock, I love this one<br />11. WALK AWAY is OK, still like it though<br />12. UNWIND is a great song, my favorite on the CD<br />13. LOVE SONG is a cool song, I like how her voice sounds on it, great way to end a CD (but theres 1 more)<br />14. HOOKER (bonus track) is an AWESOME song, right behind Unwind...very good song, for all you hookers out there
B0000C8AVR|5.0|If you have any doubts as to the merits of Highway 61, they'll be promptly blown to Hell by the first ten seconds of &quot;Like a Rolling Stone,&quot; the album's oppening track. That musical oppening is truly amazing, a gust of wind that blows open your mind. In fact,  that whole six-minute epic shows Dylan in full form, with his trademark voice and brilliant lyrical explorations (&quot;Never understood that it ain't no good/ You shouldn't let other people get their kicks for you.&quot;) All nine of the album's songs are upbeat electric rockers, mixed in with Bob's typical wild, enthusiastic, attitude. As per usual, the album incorporates blues (&quot;It Takes a Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry&quot;), folk (&quot;Desolation Row&quot;) and flat out garage rock (&quot;Tombstone Blues&quot;).<BR>All throughout Highway 61 Revisited, Bob's songwriting skills are better than they've ever been. Here he experiments with strange lyrical themes that give the album a surreal feel, as well as brilliant puns (&quot;The sun's not yellow, it's chicken!&quot;). The lyrics range from the profound and meaningful stuff of tracks such as &quot;Desolation Row&quot; and &quot;Like A Rolling Stone&quot; to the downright bizarre, on songs such as &quot;Ballad of a Thin Man,&quot; and &quot;Queen Jane Approximately.&quot;<BR>Backing Dylan this time are a full-scale garage-rock band. They give the album a sort of speed and rabid intensity that goes excellently with Dylan's fast-paced singing and blistering harmonica. &quot;Tombstone Blues,&quot; for example, sounds like the soundtrack to a car chase. There are slower moments, such as the eleven-minute ballad &quot;Desolation Row,&quot; which are just as superb as the more hyperactive ones. The afformentioned ballad is beautiful and warm, and so fun to get lost in.<BR>Highway 61 Revisited is by far Dylan's best and most creative work, an album that you will listen to again and again. Absolutely essential.
B00008EY65|4.0|This was an awesome movie... Storyline, graphics, sound, and the cast. Everything about this moview was awesome. Not once were we bored (took my 9 and 11 year old boys with me) My kids LOVED the movie.  Very very awesome... I would love to see sequels to this movie. All the characters had enough history in the movie to comprehend and left you wanting to know more. I was surprised at how good this movie was.  Good Job to Everyone Envolved!!!
B00005JMJ4|2.0|I agree with this sandmanvi reviewer about the racism and non-racism comments. I think the capacity of director kinda drained up but resorted to this shallow and stereotypical mockery. So maybe she wasn't purposely throwing in racism, just by coincidence due to limited talent, which can only be ballooned up by a big family pump.<br />And I understand the outrage that \\"...Coppola has made a fortune selling her clothing line in Japan. That's how she thanks the Japanese people...\\"<br />Then maybe Japanese pop culture needs to re-think itself, as not to eagerly absorb, fervently follow Western (American) pop culture... its own craze for Western culture has created ample profits for second-rate, or even third-rate American fashioners, stars, etc. who would not have slim chance in America, such as the Coppola's clothes line, Hilton sister' bag line, to name a few, or this washed-up Bob Harris in the movie...<br />All in all, this movie is bigger than itself now not because of any unique talent in it, but because of unfairness and outrage that many people sense in this movie-producing, marketing, and awarding business. Well good thing is I will never be surprised as much no matter what garbage movie \\"the Oscar goes to\\".
B0000B1OFL|5.0|Most of THE ITALIAN JOB is set in Los Angeles, but that's okay as the script coyly uses the heist in Italy as its model in LA.  Mark Wahlberg stars as Charlie, a likeable thief (if there are such things?), who vows revenge after his compatriate, played with villainess glory by Edward Norton, undermines the Italian job, steals the gold and also kills Charlie's mentor and surrogate father, nicely played by Donald Sutherland.  With that being the main plot, director F. Gary Gray wisely focuses on the heist and the chase scenes, minis in glory, are beautifully executed.  Wahlberg has that stoic manliness we used to get from guys like Mitchum and Widmark; Charlize Theron as Sutherland's beautiful daughter, does nicely; Jason Statham, Seth Green and Mos Def are perfect members of Wahlberg's gang.  The flashbacks where Wahlberg explains how they all got into crime are hilarious.  Crisp editing, a marvelous score by John Powell and beautiful locales help add to the pluses of this well done thriller.

B0000542D2|4.0|A Hard Day's Night is a GREAT movie and the DVD does help with the quality of the film. However when i bought this i thought possibly some of the extra features would contain interviews with the Beatles and so on. THERE WERE NONE..But since the movie is great and so is the quality i would still recommend buying it.

0061015725|5.0|Michael Chrichton is one of my favorite all-time authors... This new title from him is very good, as always. I have not yet finished the reading of Prey, but I feel that it contains all the ingredients to make this story one great MUST-READ BOOK...!! Chrichton hits again..!!
0684833395|5.0|This is definately the funniest book published.  And there aren't even any jokes-- just pure scathing irony and paradox, sarcasm and wit (the greatest forms of comedy).  The style of telling is to be celebrated.  The transitions are great (my favorite part); from one year to the next in one terse comedy of a sentence.  It is all so compact in its delivery and connected through the text.  Its told out of order, so certain anecdotes make much more sense and are much funnier later on.  Yossarian, Yo-Yo, is the best straight man in literature.  His cast of pals are uproarious in rediculous seriousnous over something that, in this new wonderful light, can only be laughed at (Appleby: &quot;Do I have flies in my eyes?&quot;).  It is both sad and comic, by the sheer weirdness of it, as well as pathetic and selfservingly hilarious.  The small repitions of mundanity are going to catch up to you; the intermittently gradual reintroduction of small details will seem peculiarly silly.  And the serious parts --Snowden's &quot;I'm cold,&quot;-- are beautiful, gritty, real, shocking fiction.  Heller was a wonderful writer, truly tops to spin both certain laughter and the touching pall of warfare into his greatest book.  Must Read.
B0000TB01Y|3.0|This C.D. in and of itself is great. The music is exhilerating and the voices are incredible. BUT, as great as this is talentwise, the plot of Wicked is a just another pity plea. I had a different color skin and they were mean to me.......i was trying to be good...it isn't my fault that it all went wrong. d. We've all heard it before--Ha! You thought i was the villain, but i'm actually the victim!
0684867621|5.0|I gave this to my secretary to read, who is the member of a literary club and had never read anything by King. She was hesitant but at my recommendation she read it. She loved it and it gave her a whole new appreciation for King.

B00008J4P5|5.0|You know....after seeing a few of these reviews I realize that the White Stripes are kinda like the Ramones.  They both tried to strip rock down to it's bare essences and some people still JUST DIDN'T GET IT!  The old &quot;what is this junk?&quot; adtitude.  If &quot;Elephant&quot; isn't one of the greatest records that this era has produced then WHAT IS?!?!  I guess it's because some people just have no idea what type of magic music had back in the late '60s and the 70s.  For years I have waited for something to introduce my generation to the good blues rock that once was.  It needs to be simple like it is...you can't add to it that would only complicate things.  Buy this CD and let it transform your ideas of popular music and pick up a Robert Johnson CD while your at it...he's located in the blues section!
B00000G28U|3.0|Garage Days is a good set from Metallica but make sure you get the Explicit version. Disc 1 is alright, it has some covers such as Tuesday's Gone, Turn The Page, and Whiskey In The Jar. It isn't that bad at all. But Disc 2 is where the real treats are. You get a great Killing Joke cover (The Wait), 2 songs that were on the original CD release of Kill Em All (Blitzkrieg and Am I Evil), some Motorhead covers, and So What. It's too bad on the clean version the latter song is heavily edited. Most of it consists of &quot;bleeps&quot; that pretty much butcher the song. I highly recommened checking this package out just for Disc 2 alone. But get the regular version and ignore this one.
B00006EXL5|5.0|So people are talking and obsessing about Gerard's supposed infatuation with vampires - and now they're being called like satanic and 'creepy' and whatnot. There is one song, &quot;Vampires will never hurt you&quot;, and it's not referring to REAL VAMPIRES, people, it's a metaphor for people who try to take everything from you. If you do a bit of research, or even listened a bit harder, you MIGHT realize that. geez. It's not satanic or creepy or anything else dumb, he just thinks of lyrics that go over most people's heads.<br />It IS pretty dark and brooding, but it's definitely worth a listen. If you've heard the new cd and want to listen to the old music, it's quite a bit different. I wouldn't say Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge is better because they're way too different to compare them, but the new cd probably appeals to a larger fanbase.<br />Track 1 (Romance) is the intro. Nothing really special, it is interesting, no vocals.<br />Track 2 (Honey, this mirror isn't big enough for the two of us) is a really good song with awesome lyrics. pretty screamy. 13/10<br />Track 3 (Vampires will never hurt you) isn't really one of my favorites, it seems to be pretty popular with other people though. Not the best lyrics, in my opinion, but not as terribly bad as other people make it sound. 7/10<br />Track 4 (Drowning lessons) isn't one of my favorites but it's not horrible. 8/10<br />Track 5 (Our lady of sorrows) is my favorite song by MCR, it's amazing. He drops the f-bomb quite a bit more than neccessary but this song rocks and if you get past all the cussing, the lyrics are really good. 15/10<br />Track 6 (Headfirst for halos) is also an awesome song, but i think it'll need clarification for all the people out there that refuse to think on a deeper level. The song's talking about 'i think i'll blow my brains against the ceiling'.. and it gets even more graphic than that. Well, before anyone thinks he's a suicidal maniac, in an interview he explained it like this: it's supposed to be ironic, the poppiest, most upbeat song being about killing yourself. Creative. 10/10<br />Track 7 (Skylines and turnstiles) isn't one of my favorites, but it's not too horrible. 9/10<br />Track 8 (Early Sunsets over Monroeville) is an awesome song. It's more emo than most of the cd, quieter and softer (to me, kind of bright eyes sounding). Amazing. it could be interpreted as a bit weird though. 10/10<br />Track 9 (This is the best day ever) is okay. Not one of my favorites but like the others, it's not HORRIBLE. Pretty fast and upbeat. Easy to listen to. 8/10<br />Track 10 (Cubicles) is another one i'm not a particular fan of. It's decent. Gets on my nerves a little bit. 8/10<br />Track 11 (Demolition Lovers) IS AMAZING! One of the only 6 minute songs i am completely into. Has a bit of a drawn out guitar solo, but it's got awesome lyrics and the final minute is mind-blowing. This is one of my favorite songs by them, definitely. 13/10<br />Overall an awesome cd, every couple of weeks it goes back into cd player in my car because it's just THAT good. Definitely a cd to give a listen to. Pick up the new one, while you're at it!
0385510438|4.0|If you are looking for a typical Grisham page turner, this one is not for you.  If, however, you would enjoy a liesurely paced look at the adventures of a young, liberal journalist in small town 1970's Mississippi, you will enjoy this a lot.  It is a good story that, unlike many Grisham books, reaches a well thought out conclusion.  It is &quot;A Painted House&quot; with lawyers.
0316168815|5.0|The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold is great, just great!  Susie Salmon is just fourteen when she is raped and murdered by a neighborhood man. The books tell about the events that take place after Susie's death with her family, and about her life in &quot;her&quot; heaven.  This novel doesn't forget about our antagonist, though, who is dies in a realistic way. Sebold deosn't want to please the audience, in my opinion. She just wants the story to go along withought seeming fake. The Lovely Bones doesn't try to make you feel sorry for Susie, it just wants the reader to have a deeper understanding about rape. Remember people, this is literature, not a soap. I, personally, don't understand the mediocre reviews. This book is superb!
B00005JLR8|5.0|In America is a caring movie about an American dream that comes true. It's a sweet movie, with great acting from everyone. A true joy.
158799190X|2.0|Overall, I found this book enjoyable. However, the salient points could have been written in a few pages. The book drags on and seems intent on settling scores with either colleagues or the demons in the author's head. The author makes a dull subject interesting - but his writing style and hang-ups are a turn-off after a while. A shame really, as the the book is an interesting read when the author stays on-theme.
B000022TSH|5.0|Many writers consider Robert Towne's screenplay for `Chinatown' as the perfect screenplay. It is, and is also in fact the example of how important good writing is in the art of cinema. It is perfection and in the hands of Roman Polanski it became a film masterpiece. But it all goes back to the writing. Robert Towne has taken the true story of how Los Angeles stole water to grow and wound around it the fictional story of Jake Gittes, Evelyn Mulwray, and Noah Cross and made them major participants in an ugly little tale of lust and greed.  Towne's screenplay is layered like a decaying Dahlia with twisting mysteries and taught suspense. There is not a loose end in sight and a few well placed red herrings are added to the mix to delight any fan of this type of story.<br />  The attention to detail from vintage cars, sets, real L.A. streets and alleys to the excellent score by Jerry Goldsmith and the golden cinematography of John A. Alonzo contribute to all the aspects of this classic of the post 60's film noir.<br />  Faye Dunaway as Evelyn Mulwray is at the top of her game creating a neurotic exotic hothouse flower that carries death within the heart of her dark and dirty secret.  Lacquered and veiled in the most perfect black widow getup of the genre she is superbly brittle and vulnerable at the same time.  She is fascinating to watch as she slowly unravels along with the mystery until she is naked in the horror of what her past and present prison is. This is a great performance by a great artist.<br />  As Evelyn's father Noah Cross, John Huston is the debauched cancerous center of evil and greed captured within the crumbling casing of a seemingly charming old man. He too gives the performance of a lifetime and his soliloquy on what a man is capable of is chilling.<br />  The center of this masterwork is Jack Nicholson who became a star with this, the best of his early work. His J. J. Gittes is hardboiled and ruthless in getting to the bottom of why he is being used to take the fall for a murder. He embodies the soul of Bogart and the heart of a romantic fighting to stay tuff in a rotten world. He is drawn with such skill that he seems not to be acting but simply existing the real world of L.A. in the late 1930's.<br />  \\"Chinatown\\" is seminal in its place in film history. It bridged and old and forgotten genre with a new Hollywood in its post studio infancy and laid the groundwork for later films of equal ambition such as \\"Mullholland Falls\\" and  \\"L.A. Confidential\\".<br />  This is one of the best film ever made and a must have for any serious film collector.ake the fall for a murder.

B0000CFW87|5.0|I liked the cd Closer much more than his first cd Josh Groban even though I have all his cds.  The songs in Closer were more inspiring and moving than the songs in Josh Groban.  For a 23 years old, Josh Groban has the most amazing and inspiring voice.  I heard his new song Remember from the soundtrack Troy and I was in tears.  I was just so inspired by hearing that song.  Each song that he does gets better and better.  I have a few favorites from Closer like Oceano, When You Say You Love Me, Broken Vow, Remember When It Rained.
B00006LSM3|5.0|This album is one of the greatest of all-time. Every song is a masterpiece. Let´s review one-by-one:<br />1-ANY ROAD: one of his greatest songs of all-time, and one of best of the entire album, as well. Excellent! (10/10).<br />2-P2 VATICAN BLUES: another great song, but not as good as the first. Great, though. (10/10).<br />3-PISCES FISH: a very touching song that always makes me cry. &quot;I´m a pisces fish and the river runs through my soul&quot;. Amen. (11/10).<br />4-LOOKING FOR MY LIFE: even more touching than &quot;Pisces fish&quot;. The lyrics are wonderful. &quot;Oh Lord, won´t you listen to me now; Oh love, I got to get me back to you somehow&quot;. Amen. (12/10).<br />5-RISING SUN: Another excellent song, as usual. A little pessimistic, though; but even so, a very good song. (10/10).<br />6-MARWA BLUES: An instrumental song. Nothing special about it.<br />7-STUCK INSIDE A CLOUD: Another song that always makes me cry. It´s about his sickness and his last moments of life. (10/10).<br />8-RUN SO FAR: A romantic ballad, written for Olivia, his wife. Great guitar work and catchy tune. (12/10).<br />9-NEVER GET OVER YOU: the same as &quot;Run so far&quot;. (12/10).<br />10-BETWEEN THE DEVIL AND THE DEEP BLUE SEA: A great song, written by Harold Arlen/Ted Koehler (10/10).<br />11-ROCKING CHAIR IN HAWAII: A fantastic song, even being the weakest (least strong, I think) part of the entire album. (9,5/10).<br />12-BRAINWASHED: An awesome song, with excellent lyrics and a great tune. The best way to end a masterpiece. (12/10).<br />GOD GOD GOD <BR>A VOICE CRIES IN THE WILDERNESS<BR>GOD GOD GOD<BR>IT WAS IN THE LONGEST NIGHT<BR>GOD GOD GOD <BR>AN ETERNITY OF DARKNESS<BR>GOD GOD GOD <BR>SOMEONE TURNED OUT THE SPIRITUAL LIGHT<br />Therefore, buy this album as you as you can! Nevermind critics!<BR>Thanks for reading, again.<BR>I miss you, George. We all love you very much.
B00025ETIW|5.0|My Chemical Romance has always been a band I have followed,they are very good and this new CD is just another step in the right direction. they pulled everything together and added to make this CD my favorite CD of my extensive collection.

B00029NMRW|3.0|everyone else here was expecting a unabtainable great movie with indepth plot lines. but you have to realize that this movie is just for fun and to make you laugh. it was funny and the had a story line even though it might not have been the best one. but if you are just looking for a movie to have fun watching this movie is good.
B000022TSW|5.0|I saw this movie in theatres.  It came out the same summer that Star Wars did, and it was sooooo much better.  I had pretty low expectations going in, but was hooked right from the first song that opens the film.  The songs were actually very decent, the jokes were hilarious, the issues well presented.  It even had great plot and character development.<br />I love the show, and even I was offended at a few points in the movie.  Honestly, though, when you look at what's actually being conveyed - it isn't the minority groups they're making fun of.  It's the people who make fun of the minority groups that they're making fun of.<br />To those who complain that this is not for children that thus gave the movie a poor review - what on earth made you think it was for kids to begin with?  Would you give Silence of the Lambs at poor review for the same reason?  This movie's target audience is not children, so don't fault it for that.<br />To those who are upset with all the vulgarity - I think the whole point of the movie is to numb you to vulgarity so that you can actually examine the issues.  My jaw dropped at first, but after a while, I could see past it.  If I had walked out of the threatre after the Uncle F-cker song, I would have missed the whole point of the movie, and that really would have been my loss.  The profanity wasn't gratuitous.  It was a vital part of the plot. And even if it weren't, who cares?<br />Do yourself a favour and rent the movie if you're not sure about it.  If you love it as much as I do, buy it afterwards and add it to your permanent collection.  But don't judge it before you've seen it, or based on what you were expecting and how it differed.  Just enjoy it for what it is.
B00008X5J3|4.0|The 2002 Oscar winner for Best Picture,\\"Chicago\\" is a musical which has the late Bob Fosse's choreography stamped all over it, although it's really anybody's guess as to whether or not he would have been pleased with this film version of his 1975 stage hit. Happily, the acting was great and the leads did their own singing and dancing.<BR> The story is based on the real-life cases of Beulah Annan and Belva Gaertner, renamed respectively as Roxie Hart and Velma Kelly (There was a real Roxie Hart as well, who committed murder in Indiana in the 1910s), who were exhonerated of murder charges by a flashy lawyer in the 1920s.<BR>  The story begins on a snowy night at the Onyx Club in the Chicago of Al Capone, where the booze flows heavily despite Prohibition laws, and a brassy Velma (Catherine Zeta-Jones) arrives at work late, stopping to hide the gun she has just used to kill her husband and sister after catching them in bed together. She performs the rousing number, \\"All That Jazz\\" shortly thereafter as if nothing has happened.<BR> Watching her is ex-chorine Roxie, played by a slender, shiny-complexioned and pixie-faced Renee Zellweger, whose unquenchable desire for fame has led her to cheat on her mechanic husband  with a slickster furniture salesman (Dominic West)who falsely claims he has connections that can revamp Roxie's career.<BR> Soon, Roxie and Fred Casley scurry over to the Hart's apartment to continue their affair. When Roxie asks Fred, as she has before, when he will introduce her to the club manager, and help her return to showbusiness, Fred admits that he lied. The following confrontation becomes violent and Roxie fatally shoots Fred as he tries to leave.<BR> Amos Hart, Roxie's dim-witted but devoted husband(John C. Reilly) tries to cover for her at first as Taye Diggs' Bandleader/Announcer leads us further into the action by introducing Roxie's first number, \\"That Funny Honey\\", which changes tones as the investigator mentions the victim's name and Amos becomes aware of his wife's infidelity.<BR> Roxie is arrested and taken to the Cook County Jail, where Chita Rivera, who originated the role of Velma Kelly on Broadway,has a cameo appearance as inmate Nickie.<BR> We are then introduced to Matron Mama Morton(a pretty, regal, and matronly Queen Latifah), and the vaudville numbers continue as she sings the racy and more-than-highly suggestive \\"When You're Good to Mama\\".<BR> As she begins her time in prison, we get to know Roxie's inmates during \\"The Cell Block Tango\\". Judging from the visuals, where most of the inmates' handkerchiefs came out red  as they finished giving details of their crimes and the Hungarian immigrant's was white, we are to believe that Katalin Helinszki (Ekaterina Chtchelkanova), who was accused of the most heinous of the murders, is innocent. <BR> Soon after, Mama Morton pulls a few strings, Defense Attorney Billy Flynn (Richard Gere, whose early training in stage musicals, like that of Catherine Zeta-Jones' serves him well here) arrives to represent Roxie, who also has push-over journalist/sob-sister, Mary Sunshine(Christine Baranski)in her corner.<BR> The song \\"We Both Reached for the Gun\\" is based on headlines from the actual case, and has the feel of a hymn sung at a revival meeting. It is reflective of Roxie's false repentance for her misdeeds.<BR> As the publicity  surrounding Roxie grows, and the opportunistic Flynn begins to devote more time to her than to his previous client, Velma, another potentially lucrative case appears for Billy  when Lucy Liu's pineapple heiress, Kitty Baxter committs a triple homicide(Note that his discussion of this case with dinner guests would not have taken place today), forcing Roxie and Velma to use a few tricks to win back Billy's attention, including a fake pregnancy. <BR>  Onstage, as the murder-as-entertainment scenario continues, we are treated to the long-suffering but loyal Amos' \\"Mr. Cellophane\\", and his devotion to his unfaithful and ungrateful wife is heart-rending. But at least he gets more attention than the offscreen family of Fred Casley, who might have given the story an interesting perspective if included.<BR> Roxie's falling-out with Billy over his selected courtroom attire for her ends abruptly upon her observation of the tragic results of a poor woman's inability to get proper representation. Noteworthy is the strong anti-immigrant sentiment of the time.<BR> Ultimately, Flynn, Velma, and Roxie, razzle-dazzle 'em in court. Lies win out over truth, and style, in the form of Flynn, Velma and Roxie,  wins over substance in the form of Colm Feore's prosecutor, Martin Harrison, Katalin Helinszki, and Amos, and the Hart's neighbor, Mrs. Borusewiz (Jayne Eastwood), who also took the witness stand, as often happens in life.<BR> Although acquitted, things didn't end so happily for the real Beulah Annan, whose life ended in a sanitarium in 1928.Belva Gaertner lived to see her story told onstage the year before. <BR> But the man-manipulating Roxie Hart and Velma Kelly live to dazzle the world again, and our rollicking tale of cynical truth ends on a positive note for our main players. <BR> All one could do in the end is heave a sigh, enjoy the show, and \\"All That Jazz\\"!
6302158249|5.0|This film catches Dire Straits at their best...a concert for the ages.    State of the art audio quality when first released on LP, the video and soundtrack for the video release were Digitally Remastered.

B00005NWLO|5.0|From it's original release, One More From The Road has been considered among the best live albums available.  It's certainly at the top of my list.  This is the record that really catapulted Skynyrd to the top of the heap, and it captures the energy that made them such an outstanding live act.  This 25th anniversary edition has some great modifications.  The tracks have been reconfigured to match the original set list, including the additions of 'Simple Man' and 'Gimme Back My Bullets'.  It also has all of Ronnie Van Zant's between song banter.  So this is now the definitive document of Skynyrd at their peak.  The double CD set is filled out with alternate takes of several songs (the album was complied from 2 shows at the Fox Theater in Atlanta).  These alternate takes (and the alternate between song banter) are interesting, but not essential.  Overall, it's as good as it gets.  I'd give it more stars if I could!!!
B00008J4P5|5.0|This is a great CD.  All within this one little record they certainly pack a big punch and channel the Beatles (&quot;The Air beneath my fingers&quot;), vintage blues (&quot;ball and biscuit&quot;), the Velvet Underground's Mo Tucker (&quot;in the cold, cold night&quot;) while still keeping everything completely original.  Truly the White Stripes are like no other band-- sure, you can call them gimmicky and simple-- but that's what makes them so unique and sets them apart from all the other over-produced, filtered-through Kurt Cobain wannabes on MTV.  <br />I really feel like I must address this whole &quot;they can't play their instruments&quot; thing.  First of all, sure there are kids in my high school who are 12 years younger than Jack and amazing guitar players.  Sure, someone can say they could kick Meg's ass on drums-- but the difference is, the White Stripes have put out four albums, written many many original songs, brought back rock'n'roll in radio's time of need, and realized what is most important-- creating something raw, with energy and feeling, no matter how &quot;minimal&quot; it is.  I think Meg is a great drummer, and that's because she knows exactly what to put into the song. So what if she plays simple beats?  I truly don't think some fancy guy who could play a million drum fills would complement Jack's guitar playing and singing as well as Meg does.  I even read an interview with Jack and he said that he's tried playing with other drummers and it just doesn't sound right.  I think that the White Stripes deserve all the attention and certainly all the &quot;hype&quot;... they are talented musicians because they realize what makes rock'n'roll music truly GOOD.

RENT IT FIRST and see if you like it before buying it! There is nothing worse than buying a movie and finding out you hate it. I have not watched this movie in quite some time, so I will not attempt to post a real review of it, but at least get this from my post:<br />DO NOT BUY THIS UNTIL YOU HAVE WATCHED IT!
B0001Z53AQ|3.0|After hearing devils night, I thought D-12 was a sick ass group making real rap music but after this cd, they ain't nothin.  Devil's night was hard and grimey but this cd is way too commercial.  There's some good songs thus giving it 3 stars but nothin to really get excited over.  Eminem usually don't put nothin out until it's perfect...well what the hell happened with this cd?  Songs to check out: Git Up, Loyalty, My Band, 6 In the Morning, How Come, Get My Gun, 40 oz, American Psycho II, and Good Die Young.  The rest you can do without.

B000002J09|4.0|Led Zeppelin manages to assault the ears of their listener and yet draw you in even deeper with each resulting track until finally you are burried under the waves of sound that climax in &quot; When the Levy Breaks&quot;. Led Zeppelin is perhaps at their height of artistic expression in this album, with Jimmy Page exhibiting his remarkable talents on both the electric and acoustic guitars. Led Zeppelin IV drives from track to track with an intensity of emotion and sound that is astonishing for the most part, but reaches a sublime measure when tracks like &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; come on. At times rolicking, and at others pensive, this is perhaps one of the peaks of Led Zeppelin's creativity.
B000003TA4|5.0|For all the people that hate Nirvana because they think they are overrated, I want you to sit down and listen to this album the whole way through every second of every song. Then you will notice that they are not overrated. But back onto this CD... Thsi is quite possibly in the top 15 albums ever reocrded. Every song is excellent and artsy. Kurt's punishment of his guitar...Krist's booming bass...Dave's pounding on his drums and Kurt's poetic lyrics, all this adds up to one of the great albums in Rock N' Roll History. Don't hate this album because of its phenominal success.

I symphatsize with the characters Al Pacino plays usually like his Michael Corleone<BR>character in Francis Coppola's Godfather Films, Frank Serpico, and Sonny Wortzik in Sidney Lumet's Dog Day Afternoon, and to <BR>another extent Carlito Brigante in Carlito's Way (Also by director De Palma, and producer Martin Bregman), but here his<BR>arrogant mobster character Tony Montana is such a perverted jerk<BR>and an over-the-top slob that you can't symphatsize with him.<BR>Five star classics like Martin Scorsese's Raging Bull, The Godf-<BR>ater Films, Arthur Penn's Bonnie And Clyde, Sam Peckinpah's The<BR>Wild Bunch, and the original Scarface originally titled Shame<BR>Of The Nation deserve to be remembers as excellent five star <BR>classics for they feature bad characters but deep inside you can<BR>symphatsize with them, for their character elements have <BR>restrained emotions, emotional depth, and convincing elements<BR>that make you feel for those characters. Scarface contains none<BR>of these. Here the character of Tony Montana is such a cartoon,<BR>and he lacks character depth and you can't care about him, you<BR>just want to wait for the end when he gets his just deserts. You<BR>want to see Brian De Palma's best film see The Untouchables and<BR>Carrie. You want Al Pacino's best performance see The Godfather<BR>Films, Heat, Donnie Brasco, Dog Day Afternoon, and Serpico. You<BR>want Michelle Phieffer's best performance see Dangerous Liasions<BR>and Age Of Innocence. You want Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio's best performance see The Abyss. You want Robert Loggia's best<BR>performance see Prizzi's Honor. You want F. Murray Abraham's best performance see Amadeus. You want Steven Bauer's best performance see Traffic. In closing the 1980's is a horrible<BR>horrible decade. The 21st century is an awesome awesome decade.<BR>Thank God were living in the 21st century where everything is<BR>great including nice people, the internet, DVD's, great movies,<BR>great music, and great and better HBO TV.

B000069HZP|5.0|Nicholas Van Orton (Douglas) thinks that he has everything - this is true only is we consider material possessions (a vast house, millions of dollars, an enviable reputation, etc.). What he is lacking is the access to the sacred and to his true Self. CRS is there to help, courtesy of his brother Conrad (Penn). But Van Orton will have to get rid of all that he previously stood for and accept to lose himself in the unknown. While some viewers have objected to the film's outrageous events and progression, this is precisely what draws me to it: its willingness to dispense with 'believable' developments makes Van Orton's quest all the more powerful. The movie could have been subtitled 'The initiation of a millionaire', because Van Orton undergoes numerous archetypal trials: he is stuck in a car underwater (in the belly of the monster); he is buried alive; his descensus ad infernos is such that he (literally) has to make a death-defying jump in a garbage dump; he has to find his way through mazes and use secret keys; most scenes take place in darkness. By the time he becomes a new man late in the movie, he has already died three or four times! Perceptive viewers will discover far more than a strandard thriller here, if they allow themselves to dig under the surface... a remarkable film.
B000002J1O|5.0|Writing a review for an album as famous and important as \\"Selling England...\\" is the most difficult task. What would I say that wasn't already said a thousand times?<br />This is one of those albums that made a substancial impact on the history of music. Genesis further improved their skills and recorded an album that is arguably their best, and that is without any doubt one of 20 most important 70s albums. Progressive rock takes influence from English traditional music here, and Peter Gabriel's very expressive theatrical vocals add character to the songs. Instrumentally the band performs flawlessly, and everyone proves his instrumental skills. The album is full of long developing passages, intricate solos, clever background playing, and sudden rhythm changes. The music is very complex, while accessible. The biggest surprise of \\"Selling England...\\" is how skillfully the band stays on the edge between emotional and over-the-top. Many prog-rock albums often turn out to be excercises in self-indulgence. On the contrary, Genesis proves to have exceptional taste for music and performance, and knows exactly when it's time to stop or pull back. This is a work of genious, and a template for what is good and serious rock. Lyrics are also important in the album, touching serious topics with a peculiar sense of humor.<br />Ironically, what nobody in 1973 knew, is that a song \\"More Fool Me\\", sung by Phil Collins, would actually turn out to be a taste of things to come, when Gabriel had decided to quit the band.<br />It's absolutely obvious that this album is a must to hear. It would also be a perfect introduction into Genesis and progressive rock in general for newcomers. While I'm not a devoted Genesis fan, I can't understand a rating less than 5* for this album. There aren't too many prog-records to be compared with this piece of greatness.
B00012FXAE|5.0|Director James Cameron has achieved the impossible. He not only<BR>succeeds at expertly crafting a sequel that not only lives up to<BR>Ridley Scott's excellent original Alien, but he also goes into<BR>a different direction and creates one of the most brilliant and<BR>throughly exciting sci-fi action film ever made along with Term-<BR>inator 2 Judgement Day. The story picks up where Alien left off,<BR>Lt. Ellen Ripley (Played by the superb Sigourney Weaver) and the<BR>orange cat Jones go into a deep sleep and are woken up fifty-seven years later. Shortly after Ripley wakes up, she starts having bad nightmares about her last experience with the acid<BR>spitting space creature from the last film. After the colony of <BR>LV-426 loses contact with some colonists, the corporation headed<BR>by Carter Burke (Paul Reiser), whose actions are questionable<BR>asks Ripley to come back and fight her fears, by leading a team<BR>of tough marines, she eventually accepts. After getting there, she is introduced to the marines which include Hudson (the hill-<BR>arious Bill Paxton), Vasquez (Jenette Goldstein), the restrained<BR>Hicks (Michael Biehn), and the android Bishop (the awesome <BR>Lance Henriksen), who does this awesome knife trick. At first<BR>Ripley does not accept Bishop's friendship after her last encou-<BR>nter with an android, which was Ian Holm's Ash from the first film. However, after things go awry on the planet LV-426, the <BR>marines along with Ellen Ripley must fight the aliens and accept<BR>Bishop's friendship. Another fascinating element of Aliens is the mother daughter relation between Ripley and Newt, who is <BR>played by one time actress Carrie Henn. The outstanding cast is<BR>excellent: Sigourney Weaver was so superb in her role that she<BR>was garnered an oscar nomination for best actress, Bill Paxton<BR>delivers a comediac performance as Hudson (Game Over Man), Michael Biehn is awesome as Hicks, Lance Henriksen is brilliant<BR>as humane android Bishop, Carrie Henn is sweet as little girl<br />Newt, and Paul Reiser surprises you with what kind of character<BR>he actually is (you won't symphatsize with him here). If you<BR>want a film with exciting thrills, awesome action-packed enter-<BR>tainment watch Aliens for that happens to be one of my favorite<BR>action film's.
B0001UZZWW|3.0|I ordered SHREK3-D because i thought it would be a full length movie but i was wrong. it is only a 15-18 minute chase scene where shrek and donkey have to save Fiona. i actually remeber seeing the segement on TV! i was dissapointed but the 3-d action was okay. i have to say that for such a big company they could have upped the 3-d. however the orginal shrek was and will always be really good. but i wouldn't spend $23 on getting both. i would just rent it from your local movie store. actually you might want to buy both from a used dealer. that is what i did and now i am really glad that i only spent $16 on both for the price of one. YOU ARE BETTER OFF BUYING THE DVD FROM A USED DEALER. THEY ARE ACTUALLY BRAND NEW STILL IN THE FACTORY SEALED BOX!! TRUST YOU BE GLAD YOU SAVED YOUR MONEY:) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :)

0385507755|5.0|Speaking as someone who deals with addiction every day and has been through rehab and frequents AA meetings, I can say that this book is one of the most thorough and understanding accounts of the process of early sobriety.  While my experiences differ from Mr. Frey's, the thought process is unbelievably similar and it was shocking to read something that hit so close to home.  I recommend this book to anyone remotely interested in the subject of addiction, or anyone using drugs or alcohol who is concerned about their future and is considering quitting.  This book has allowed me to experience a true spiritual awakening.

B0000DZ3EN|5.0|&quot;Return to Oz&quot; is one of those rare movies that captures your heart and truly makes you believe in magic.  To this day, it still hasn't let my heart go!  This amazing, underrated film is a real Hollywood gem.  Buy it, and you will surely treasure it forever.<br />Of course, that depends on your expectations of this trip to Oz.  Although there are no sugary sweet characters bouncing about singing and dancing, there is an abundance of subtle beauty in the ways of costume and set design.  Instead of the cutesy munchkins and radiant Glinda, there are the horrible Wheelers and the pretty-yet-terrifying Princess Mombi.  Additionally, there are some scenes (i.e. the Hall of Heads, the Deadly Desert, the Nome King Showdown, etc.) that may frighten young children (it scared me, but I love the movie nonetheless).  The point is, like many movies, you'll enjoy &quot;Return to Oz&quot; if you go in open-minded and ready for anything. :)<br />This movie and the 1939 musical classic were produced by two different companies, with different budgets, different set managers, different actors, different screenwriters, and different directors.  It just so happens that &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; was an enormous hit during the &quot;Golden Age&quot; of movies (esp. musicals) and has remained a family favorite ever since.  Any follow up to such a successful movie is going to be criticized unless it is even better than the &quot;original.&quot;  A large number of fans enjoy &quot;Return to Oz&quot; so much because it parallels L. Frank Baum's original stories closer than the Judy Garland adaptation.  <br />Please don't get me wrong--I adore each and every aspect of &quot;The Wizard.&quot;  I just like &quot;Return to Oz&quot; as well and feel it is worthy of a second glance/chance.  Try it and see for yourself.  I'm sure there will be something about it that you will never forget! :)
0345442970|3.0|Reason for writing this review, too many reviews give 4-5 stars. To clarify, if ur looking to dig deeper into the big picture stuff, such as the relations between the Republic and the Trade Federation and Nubula Front, or Palpetine, then this is a 4 star book. <br />Other than that, if u want a character driven story look somewhere else. The only interesting characters in this book to follow are Palpetine, for his subtle scheming and Captain Cohl who is a hard nosed mercenary working against the Republic. All the jedi are quite one dimensional even though they take up 1/2 the book. The main Jedi here is Qui Gon who is intent to catch Cohl. The author does touch on why Qui Gon is a sort of mavrick in Jedi circles, but would have been interesting to see more of this and less Yoda/Windu babble.
B00028HBKM|5.0|I saw this in the theater about a month after it was released. From the beginning, I knew I was going to see a movie the likes of which I had never seen (and I've seen many). First, there were no previews at all(I kid you not). The lights went dark, and it went right into the movie. It opened with the passage \\"But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed (Isaiah 53:5)\\".  I couldn't believe that I was watching a movie that began with no previews, nor could my girlfriend.  If that is an example of the seriousness with which this movie is taken, I don't know what is.  I'm not going to go into the details of the violence. I'm sure you've all heard of it by now.  I can guarantee that it is without a doubt the most graphic movie you have ever seen.  But, it was an excellent movie.  I am not a religous person AT ALL, but this film made me appreciate Christ.  It is well worth the money to own the DVD.  It will make you take a look at your life and realize how trivial most things are.
B00005B4GU|4.0|I would agree with some others that \\"Amnesiac\\" is not as good Kid A.  It's slightly below the level of the other records Radiohead has releasted in the past half decade.  However, even if it's a lessor effort, it is still a very good album.  As a whole, the album isn't as strong or profound as their other works, but it does have a few individual sounds that are quite amazing.<br />Rathern than go into a long-winded review of the album, and analyze every aspect of the album, I'll leave that to the other reviews here.<br />However, I must take the opportunity to defend the track \\"Hunting Bears.\\"  Reading many of these reviews, most of them unfairly criticize this song, condemning it as mere \\"filler\\" and \\"a boring two-minute repetitive guitar bit.\\"  It's much more than that.  Yes, it's just an instrumental, it's bascially two minute-long guitar bits played back to back--what's wrong with that?  I find it altogether enigmatic, atmospheric, and tranquil.  I also like how they throw in a soft whooshing sound in the background to support the guitar.<br />There is also a short instrumental on Kid A, \\"Treefingers.\\"  That song is also often unfairly dismissed.  Both \\"Treefingers\\" and \\"Hunting Bears\\" are astounding, trance-inducing instrumentals that hit inner strings inside me that few other songs can.
B00005MP58|5.0|This movie is so amazing I've watched it so many times and I never get tired of it.  I thought this was by far the best film adaptation of the novel.  Colin Firth portrayed Mr. Darcy  exactly as I pictured him in my mind.  I loved all the characters and felt like the actors/actresses lived up the their characters in the novel.  While the picture quality may not be that great (read several comments about it) it didnt bother me one bit.  The locations they filmed were simply beautiful, the story and characters entralling, and the costumes and scenes eye catching....I didnt even notice the quality.

B00005JLD4|5.0|This is probably the most emotional a film has ever made me. It's powerful, disturbing, and full of hope in the same breath. For &quot;westernized&quot; reviewers who acknowledge the content of this movie as an atrocity, this film is a wake up call to truly challenge to your beliefs. If you were in the same situation as a white person in 1931, would you still feel the same as you do now after seeing the movie or would you believe assimilation was the right thing to do? The most important thing to take away from this film is to never forget.
0385493622|5.0|I heard about this story in a documentary and was intrigued, even though I am mathematically challenged. I bought it on a whim, though I expected it may end up on the shelf of books that I'll never get to but make me look smarter for owning them.<br />One day I decided to give it a try for a few minutes. Several hours later I was deep into it and giving up sleep to read &quot;one more chapter&quot;. <br />Singh does an excellent job of explaining complex mathematical problems so even I could understand them. Even so, I doubt that math geeks will find these sections condescending or oversimplified. For those like me who have negative physical reactions at the mere mention of math, the math sections are actually interesting to follow, and they add to the story so you can really understand what is going on. <br />Mostly, this book is an interesting history of the mathematical problem the title implies. The story is well paced, organized chronologically, and has an excellent mix of literary devices to keep you flipping pages well past bedtime.<br />This book has now ended up on the shelf of books I intend to re-read periodically.
B000062YAZ|5.0|Slayer's Reign in Blood is like a handful of other albums I treasure.  Nevermind, Vulgar Display of Power, Number of the Beast, Forbidden Evil, 40oz to Freedom, Zeppelin II, Angel Dust, and probably a dozen others.  My feeling is that there are a few select albums that really stand out as being done perfectly, Reign in Blood is #1 in that list.  At no point in Reign in Blood can a listener logically say hey it would have been better done if they had done this note like this, Reign in Blood is PERFECT.  Angel of Death, take it as you might as a venomous song about german warfare, encompasses the most ingenious guitar and drumwork known to heavy metal.  Its not about metal, its about perfection.  Slayers Reign in Blood is perfect, as are all the albums aformentioned. South of Heaven and Seasons in the Abyss come awefully close to achieving that same perfection.  Reign in Blood certainly sparks an entire generation of metal in 1986 and as equally sparks 5 million jerkos that shouldnt have picked up a guitar in the first place.
B0001HAHXW|5.0|Eric Clapton has always paid homage to Robert Johnson and this is a &quot;Thank You&quot; to the MAN.  Eric takes the songs he's loved throughout the years and made them his own with a nod to Mr. Johnson.  In response to some previous postings, many black blues men, BB King, Freddy King, Muddy Waters, have said that Eric was born to play the blues.  I myself will always be grateful to him for turning me on to the genre and making me want to go back and explore the originals.  Thank you, thank you, thank you!!<BR>PS.  I LOVE Red Hot!!!
B00008H2LB|5.0|Linkin Park are not forty year old leather pants long hair metalists. Although some of those bands from previous decades such as Metallica, Pantera, Megadeth, Slayer etc., have definitely influenced them and deserve all the credit that they receive for their pioneering influence in current rock music, Linkin Park's influences are not just limited to a small group of bands. The bandmembers of Linkin Park (who are in their twenty's) grew up listening to a wide array of bands that spanned different genres from U2 ande Depeche Mode to EPMD, Jurassic 5, Bjork and Aphex Twin. Their Style of music is a representation of these types of influences which include rock, hip-hop, and electronic; hence their original name Hybrid Theory. They never claimed or tried to represent themselves as a true hardcore metal band. I believe a large number of their fanbase also grew up in the 80's and 90's listening to a similar musical catalogue Linkin Park did. If more people had a chance to see footage or read articles on their creative process then their critics who do not like their music would at least understand the large amount of effort and work that they put into their records. This is a band that does not fall into the normal trappings that most &quot;rock bands&quot; almost seem obligated to fall into,i.e. inexplicable drug use,rampant excess,and a general disrespect for their fans. I think it is refreshing to see a band be themselves and not compromise their morals or genuine personalities to fit the rock star cliche'. The old school metal community who refuse to give this band any shred of credit need to understand that those bands of previous decades defintely did make great contributions to rock but that their time has passed. And if people who grew up only listening to one style of music want to cling on to their bands of the past then more power to them. Just don't knock a band in the present time that takes their influences and molds them into their own sound. This band hassold millions of records. They must have some sort of connection with the people buying their records, if not the rock purists, and in the end maybe that's all that matters.
1400032717|5.0|In my opinion, this book belongs on the same shelf as The Catcher in the Rye, Huckleberry Finn and the Reivers. I found the unique and challenging point of view of Christopher John Francis Boone a delight to read. I thought I would get put off by the constant tangents on which Christopher tends to perseverate, but found instead that they added a dimension to Christopher that our \\"average\\" minds do not always think about. I loved seeing things from Christopher's point of view and how alien our world must appear to him, in addition to the unusual challenges that he faces just to find his way around.<BR> Beyond the autistic point of view, I found this a very engaging \\"coming of age\\" novel. It is substantially different from the hit film \\"Rain-Man\\", for two reasons. First, Raymond in the film is a distant character. We are introduced to him, but we do not come to \\"know\\" him, as is typical for many autistic individuals (many high-functioning autistics tend to refer to themselves in the third person, for example). As the audience, we come to know Christopher very well. Second, Raymond does not make choices for himself-he is lead by his backpack like a donkey chasing a stick, whereas Christopher shows insight as to how he makes decisions, and shows remarkable courage in being able to act on them, despite seemingly insurmountable hurdles.<BR> Someone else mentioned that we do not pity Christopher, but what was more telling for me is that Christopher never pities himself, from what I can recall in the book. If anything, I pitied Christopher for having such dysfunctional parents, but not for having autism. As a reader, I liked Christopher, but there were many clues that he would not be a pleasant person to be around-his screaming, hitting and outbursts are a constant reminder that, although he functions very well in the mathematical world, he would be an extremely challenging individual to interact with in real life.<BR> If there is one flaw that I had with this novel, it isthat it's popularity may convince many uneducated individuals that all autistic people are high-functioning mathematical geniuses. In fact, only a very small percentage of autistic individuals have these talents, and the majority tend to be severely mentally retarded with little chance of interacting independently in regular society.<BR> The one other comment is not a flaw, but a desire of my own: I did not want this book to end, although I also could not put it down and hastened it's end prematurely. I would be tempted to beg the author for a sequel, but that would be like not seeing the forest for the trees. The novel served its purpose: to demonstrate what life is like from the viewpoint of an autistic individual. From my own relatively uneducated viewpoint, the author succeeds in this admirably well. Whether we hear more from Christopher, or about someone else, I think that Mark Haddon has a remarkable literary career ahead of him.

1592400876|5.0|Who would have thought that a book on punctuation would be interesting?  Amazingly though it is.  I picked up a copy to skim through, figuring it would sit on the shelf like a dictionary, and actually started reading it.  If you can make a subject like this interesting, you have talent as a writer.<br />I think the best aspects are the humor used to describe the value of punctuation.  Leno used to do some very funny bits about signs and advertising that sent a very different message than intended, and this book also uses some of those types of examples.  Does punctuation make a difference?  Of course, and this book is a wonderful, and funny, tool to review to help better use punctuation to improve ones communication ability.<br />It will be interesting to see how this content merges with sub-languages that are developing on email, internet chat boards, and text messaging.  Now, can we update MS Word to use these kinds of fun suggestions when editing documents?
B000267JQK|5.0|Being one of the best live acts ever to come from South Africa,it's only fitting that Seether is finally getting he recognition they deserve. For the uninformed, please note that Shaun (Leadsinger/songwriter) stated on their website that a 2nd release for Disclaimer was on the way, and that fans who already bought the cd could save their bucks for the new album (due next year), without being any poorer. So for the few whiners out there that's proclaiming that Seether are sellouts or oppertunists, please get the facts straight. The record company wanted to re-release, and it gave the band the scope to redo the songs the way they originally wanted to in the first place. All in all, a brilliant package, bringing back more of the raw edge they displayed on their debut 'Fragile'. (Unfortunately only available to us lucky South African okes!)
B0001UL7RY|4.0|when I first heard that avril lavigne had a new cd coming out, I thought &quot;this is is gonna be sell out city!&quot; But I heard &quot;Don't Tell me&quot; and it sounds almost exactly like her old songs. So I bought the cd and I have to say the lyrics are better even though some are still dumb (he gave me a kiss it was something like this and made me go oh,oh) I think that example pretty much sums that up! &quot;He Wasen't&quot; sounds so much like it, I thought i was listening to sk8ter boi part 2. This time around she actually wrote 3 songs all by herself, which is impressive. I really enjoyed the tribute to her grandfather &quot;slipped away&quot;. Its really sad.Its too bad that the lyrics can't save her from being in poser territory.I can't really explain it, but the beats just scream POSER! but the lyrics are like pages from a broken hearted prep's diary. All in all, Under My skin is definitly a more personal album, still keeping a poppy vibe.
B0000009S3|3.0|Overall, this is a pretty accessible effort from rock music's greatest composer, and a good introductory piece. This doesn't mean it's his best, however. Pieces such as Peaches en Regalia and Son of Mr. Green Genes are great, and demonstrate Zappa's deftness in orchestration, a skill not usually found in rock. What turns me off from this album is the seemingly endless jamming. Gumbo Variations fits this bill perfectly. And Willie the Pimp is one of my least favorite Zappa tunes, not because of Captain Beefheart's cameo, but due to the really dull (to these ears) guitar solo. Zappa is a good, and underrated, guitarist, but here he just treads through uneventful noodling for around seven minutes. So, I'll recommend this CD, but only if you go out and buy Uncle Meat and Burnt Weany Sandwich soon after.
B0002I831S|5.0|Even with five spinoffs,ten movies and nearly 40 years of history,The original Star Trek is the one that started it all and continue to inspire millions of fans.   The plot was simple, in the future a starship goes out on a five year mission to explore strange new worlds and seek out new life and civilizations.Led by the heroic Captain James T. Kirk (willian Shatner) along with his Vulcan first officer Mr. Spock (Leonard Nimoy).The other crew members include Dr.Leonard McCoy (the late DeForest Kelley 1920-1999),Chief Engineer Montgomery \\"Scotty\\" Scott(the late James Doohan 1920-2005), Helmsman Hikaru Sulu (George Takai),Communications officer Nyota Uhura (Nichelle Nichols), and Yoaman Janice Rand (Grace Lee whitney who would only last half the first season).   Despite the cheap looking special effects and set pieces,ST was a mixture of action,humor,drama and morality tales.A far cry from other science fiction shows airing at the time such as Lost In Space.Classic first season episodes includes The Naked Time,The Enemy Within, The Menagerie ,The Conscience of the King, Balance of Terror(the Romulan's debut), Space Seed(KHAN!!!), Arena,This Side of Paradise,The Devil in the Dark, and the greatest Trek episode of all time, The City on the Edge of Forever.

B0001Z52RU|4.0|A very interesting thriller that explores many of the same themes as the recent remake of &quot;The Time Machine&quot;, in &quot;The Butterfly Effect&quot; Ashton Kutcher finds that he has the ability to travel back in time by essentially reliving his memories based on his journals. The problem is that whenever he makes any changes, there are always disasterous and unpredictable consequences of his alteration of the past (hence the relationship to &quot;chaos theory&quot; and the term &quot;The Butterfly Effect&quot;, i.e., a butterfly taking flight can have a dynamic effect on weather conditions making complete prediction impossible).<br />The film's dark vision doesn't make this light entertainment. Still, it's a very interesting and well made film that challenges the viewer's preconceptions. The kids cast in the film give strong, convincing performances. Ashton Kutcher does a solid job in his role as Evan &quot;the time traveler&quot; but he doesn't always have the dramatic depth to communicate everything he could. Still, he does an exceptional job with the skills he has to work with. He's proven that he can carry more than a comedy picture.  Amy Smart, in particularly, plays a variation on the same character many, many times with major differences depending upon how the timeline was altered.<br />I personally preferred the original theatrical ending. Why? Because creating hope out of hopelessness is an essential part of our humanity. The nilistic director's cut doesn't add anything and makes the character's sense of discovery worthless if there's no dramatic payoff that the audience can buy into.<br />The infinifilm features on the DVD allow you to watch short commentaries,a breakdown of visual effects, alternate takes,storyboards, deleted scenes with and without commentary then return immediately to the film. While it doesn't provide as much depth as a series of featurettes (or director's commentaries), it provides a thumbnail sketch of how the film took shape.<br />I'd be curious to hear the writers/directors take on the original ending vs. the theatrical cut. I won't say anything about the two except that one is more hopeful while the other is very, very dark. The latter ending made the film less pleasant for me. Sometimes the audience is right about the film and the artist wrong. In this case, I'd have to argue for watching the theatrical cut first and using the infinifilm feature to view the alternate, original ending of the film. It's the best way to gage them and compare them.<br />The DVD picture quality is pretty good overall on this dual sided single layer disc. The sound quality was a bit problematic at times as the version I purchased had some problems with distortion (which has become more and more of a problem with DVDs now that more of them are being pressed). My only complaint (a minor one at that) is that there isn't a director's commentary track.<br />&quot;The Butterfly Effect&quot; isn't a perfect thriller but it doesn't need to be; the questions it raises and the genuine suspense created by not knowing the outcome of each change in the past makes it an enjoyable film to watch. Yes, there's a lot of dark stuff that happens shaping the events in the lives of these kids but it that is the essence good drama.pe. <br />I'd be curious to hear the writers/directors take on the original ending vs. the theatrical cut.

B00009UW0N|5.0|This is the best horror movie ever in my opinion because it was the first to ever really scare me.
B000002UAI|5.0|By the time that the Beatles recorded &quot;Beatles For Sale&quot;, they were fed up.  They had been constantly touring and they had just starred a feature film, and yet they were still under the demands of the record company for a new single every three months and a new album every six months.  They could cope with this pressure for their previous two albums, but everyone has a breaking point, and so it's no surprise that it came right after the exhaustive \\"A Hard Day's Night\\", which they had filled with fourteen new originals as well as having made a movie.  Having to follow that up would make any group, even the Beatles, falter slightly.  <br />Critics and audiences alike have already noted the downsides to this pressure.  Instead of giving us fourteen new originals like they did on \\"A Hard Day's Night\\", they \\"fill out\\" the album with covers of their favorite 50s artists.  With the exception of particularly energetic performances of \\"Kansas City\\" and \\"Rock and Roll Music\\", these covers are stale and uninspired.  They stick with the arrangement of the original recordings. (Indeed, their cover of \\"Words of Love\\" sounds so remarkably like Buddy Holly's original that some casual listeners may confuse the two!).  It also must be noted that \\"Mr. Moonlight\\" is one of the Beatles most disliked tracks.  So, it's no wonder that \\"Beatles For Sale\\" is one of their most disliked LP's.<br />Now, having said all that, this album is extraordinarily under-rated and under-appreciated.  The pressure and stress had its benefits, too.  John Lennon (and Paul, to be fair, but especially John) had been studying the weary songwriting of Bob Dylan and his strong use of lyrical value.  The stress and pressure John was under gave him a perfect excuse to exercise his knowledge of this kind of songwriting.  The result: fantastic songs.  \\"No Reply\\", \\"I'm A Loser\\", \\"Baby's In Black\\", \\"Every Little Thing\\", \\"I Don't Want to Spoil the Party\\", and \\"What You're Doing\\" are all great songs.  True, they are all dark, somber, and sad, but they represent a quantum leap in the songwriting of the Beatles.  Musically, they were getting more adventurous with arrangements and were using more interesting chords (\\"No Relply\\" utilizes an Fmaj7 and a G6 [often mistaken for a G7] to great effect).  Lyrically, their lyrics were more deep and introspective.  They (again, mostly John) were no longer singing about the joys of love - they were now singing about its pains (they had done this before, but not so often, and not with such fitting musical accompaniment).<br />All in all, \\"Beatles For Sale\\" is still a five-star album despite its shortcomings.  It features great songs and it represents a new level of maturity from the Beatles.  Although it doesn't reach my \\"Platinum Series\\" status, \\"Beatles For Sale\\" is still one of my favorites.<br />(On a side note - sorry for the long review, but I had a lot to say!)<BR>~John Ballantyne
B00003CXB2|5.0|I have seen this masterpiece many many times, but only after reading T.E. Lawrence's book &quot;The Seven Pillars of Wisdom&quot; this year do I now begin to understand. This movie is a product of two of the century's greatest minds, one an author and soldier, the other a film maker. The power of Lawrence's descriptions of the desert matches the great cinematography. No film could fully project the power of the inner thoughts of this most introspective man; for that you absolutely need the book to fill in the gaps. Many of the scenes take on a much deeper meaning once you have read the book in detail. The Columbia Tri-Star two-DVD edition is faultless, something I will always treasure. I find it hard to believe that someday a better movie could possibly be made, but we can hope against hope.
B00005JL7Q|5.0|I love this movie because it is a sweet story about a jerk (Will) who ends up helping people, with a great girl, and a new look on life, yet it is not sappy or cheesy.  Amazing.  It's cute, funny, and original.  I haven't read the book, but even without reading it, this is a great movie with a wonderful cast and a story that's fun for anyone to enjoy.
0689835604|3.0|My 16 mo old daughter has loved this book since she was 12 mo., but I have to keep it out of her reach .  She loves to lift the flaps but has now been tearing the flaps off when she reads the book on her own. She is only allowed to read it in my lap where I can stop her from ripping the flap off.
B0000028M7|5.0|Are you 8 years old? You must be very creative to come up with those great nicknames... I love alice in chains but nirvana must have been on to something because for some reason... millions of people bought nevermind. however i feel smells like teen spirit is the most overrated song ever. They have tons of better songs such as serve the servants and heart shaped box..<br />Pearl Jam, alice in chains, and nirvana are the greatest bands to come out of seattle
B0000DIXDR|5.0|This is such a classic movie.  It's cheesy, it's unrealistic and it's fun.  What's not to love?  Very fun film, one to watch again and again.  I think every woman wants Johnny Castle, this movie is hot and cute and great.  Not a lot to say, just that this is a wonderful film.
B00024BHTC|5.0|Awesome symphonic metal, worth the price of import, genre lovers will love it!
B000003TA4|4.0|Kurt Cobain is a punk because he has a K records tatoo on his arm??? Grow up...<br />This record is great. i only downgraded it because of the overly played smells like teen spirit
B000003TAW|5.0|WOW! When I first bought this, I wasn't sure what to expect, but I remember the quirky Sweater song and how sweet it was. I put it into my cd player and was instantly blown away. My Name is Jonas is a powerful and strong opener to a powerful and strong cd. No One Else would be a better song on anyone else's album, but with Weezer's awesoem lineup, this is one of their lesser songs, but it still rocks. The World Has Turned picks up the pace after No One Else, and is a perfect prequel to Buddy Holly. I'm sure many of you have heard this song, alot. Some say this song gets way annoying after the 500th time, but I can't understand that. This is a catchy, awesome song, with an INCREDIBLE video (check out Weezer's Video Capture Device for that one). The Sweater Song will capture anyone's heart, it is so good. Surfwax USA is a classic surf song. Say It Aint So is in my mind the best song ever written. It blends great guitar and bass with beautiful lyrics. Amazing. In the Garage is a cool song about Weezer's time spent in their garage, surrounded by Kiss posters and Dungeons&amp;Dragons gear. Holiday is a song that, like No One Else, suffers from being on such a good album. Only in Dreams is beautiful, and that is the only way it can be explained. This album is a must have for any music fan!
B0001NBMBC|5.0|i have had this cd for quite some time now and i never leave the house without it. i don't really know how anyone can't like this. even my grandma asked me to burn this cd for her. this is an awesome alblum.
B00000I5Y6|5.0|I've been KANSAS fans for over 20 years.They had ups and downs.I think this CD is a best introductory for the beginner for AMERICAN PROGRESSIVE ROCKS.This band's pop sides are strongly stressed in this hit collection.If you are a DIEHARD fans KANSAS,dig another fulllength albums.So many long time complex pieces are omitted here.This GREAT BAND can't be told with only this CD.This is a good main gate  for the AMERICAN PROG-ROCK SEEKERS.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|ok i bought this cd the day it came out then i listened to it and it blew my mind away. slipknot has changed so much from the first two albums. they dont curse in this one and they have 2 acquistic songs which are awesome. slipknot is better than ever and people need to stop saying slipknot sucks now cuz they went soft and arent angry anymore. havent u guys realized slipknot grew up they had kids they cant write about angry stuff anymore.i hope u guys buy this cd it is the best slipknot album ever.
B00000DR5I|5.0|This electronic German unit made a basis for all the EUROBEAT SONGS,and other related TECHNO MUSIC.They resourcefully used sequencer and synthesizer sound to build their signiture sound.This original music can be utilized as a BGM or hallucination experience.That means you can listen to this CD with positive attitude or passive attitude.This sound can be a sound illusion,sound experience,sound therapy,sound drug.This CD has a lot of purpose for all the listeners.Effective sound trip awaits for you.
B00005JM02|5.0|this movie is sooo awesome they did a good job on the animation stuff in it. if they didnt find nemo in the end i might of cried...........just joking.my very very cool and awesome friend zoe she thought it was really sweet and sad. so get this movie if u dont have it. oh and hi zoe!!!!!! peace out guys
B0001ZX0PG|1.0|This movie was a grand attempt (Big time director, actors, budget etc) to tell a story which was very well done in novel form.  However, it falls on its face in too many areas.  I hate to give too much away (although much is already missing) but there are two points that must be made.  First, the killer is clear from the beginning and there is a very sensible reason for the killing - which turns out not to be the actual reason at all.  The actual reason is MUCH less fulfilling.  Second, we are supposed to believe that the cops are competent yet the climax of the investigation comes when both partners turn to the other and say &quot;I didn't listen to the 911 call, I thought you did&quot;!!  What!!  And just to add to the insanity (This is a bonus complaint), Sean Penn's wife has a soliloquy at the end that comes out of no where.  I understand that it is very difficult to take a good novel and make a good movie, but one thing to never forget is the PLOT!
B000099T2L|1.0|Beyonce can sing but I think that she should've made a better cd..Her Arrangements are horrible I bet she just made that cd in  minutes putting anything together take my advice if u wanna buy a cd buy Ashanti Chapter 2 now her cd holds it down for both fellas and da ladies
B0000DD7LC|5.0|Let's get real.  In reality, there are classic R&amp; B albums and Alicia Keys has made one and it is The Diary Of Alicia Keys. <br />As a writer, producer, pianist, singer, and woman, this album exemplifies those components of her talent so.  Songs that highlight the album are &quot;Diary&quot;. It's a peaceful and low-vibed song.  A lot of slow songs can irritate you, specifically if they are just overproduced and so production-forced.  Another track &quot;Wake Up&quot; is very stylish.  It's very Alicia and is a very great track for her period. And &quot;Nobody Not Really&quot;, which has a great piano arrangement to it.  <br />There's not an ounce of flaw to this album.  Every song is to listen to.  You don't have to skip a track nor waste your money buying it, because it's a great addition to your album collection.

0316168815|3.0|So many people recommended this book to me, I finally gave in and read it, even though I was slightly repelled to read about the brutal rape and murder of a 14-year old girl.<BR>After reading it, I'm puzzled why this book became a runaway bestseller.  Does it have something to do with our collective anxiety about our children?<BR>The book wasn't terrible, but it wasn't something I'd go out of my way to recommend.  I agree with the reviewer who said that the dad was the only &quot;real&quot; character (although the creepy George Harvey was pretty well drawn).   <BR>Most of the other characters were pretty one-dimensional. The  mom was right out of other popular books -- the intellectual woman who is stifled by the domestic role society has imposed on her(ie--suicidal mom in &quot;The Hours&quot;).  And the detective who falls in love with the mom was reminiscent of the policeman who falls for the woman in &quot;House of Sand and Fog.&quot;  Do these writers all go to the same workshops?<BR>Other than the details of the murder and the murderer, I found most of the book slightly dull.<BR>Speaking of dull, I sure hope if I go to heaven I don't have to spend all my time watching everyone back on earth!!

0783232039|4.0|Before Chucky turned killer doll, he had a girlfriend named Tiffany. In this movie Tiffany recovers the body of Chucky from a polive evidence locker. Chucky was pretty much torn to pieces in 3 so she sews him back together and uses the vodoo chant to bring his spirit back to the body. He returns just as evil as ever and horror/comedy takes up the rest of the movie.<br />This is not a good film. It is a horror movie that is so over the top on ridiculousness that it borders on comedy. I never thought I would see Chucky the killer doll, who I feared so much as a child, in a love scene. Seeing Tiffany the killer doll making cookies for Chucky while they're holding a couple hostage is quite amusing. The domestic dispute that develops between the dolls shortly after this is just hilarious.<br />This movie isn't for everyone. You'll enjoy this if you were a fan of Jason X, Freddy vs. Jason or the Evil Dead movies. If you have a dark sense of humor you'll probably love this movie.
B00005Y7GQ|4.0|While I like to think of myself as an internationalist when it comes to watching films, I had never heard of Stephen Chow before deciding to take a chance on 'Shaolin Soccer.'<br />Shame on me.  Chow turns out to be a hilarious and creative star.  Who could have dreamed of something as goofy, infectious and, at the same time, as technically brilliant (the special effects are eye-popping) as Shaolin Soccer?  Now, I'm reading through the comments left here by Mr. Chow's longtime fans and I realize I'm going to have to check out some of his \\"better works\\" (as judged by these aficionados) like 'God of Cookery' and 'From Beijing with Love'.<br />Not knowing what to expect from Shaolin Soccer, I found myself delightfully convulsed with laughter at two early points in the film:<br />- An impromptu synchronized 'street' rendition of the Kool and the Gang hit 'Celebration.'  This is almost impossible to explain.  When it took shape in the movie, I literally mouthed the words \\"What the...?\\"  Truly inspired.<br />- A second muscial number, in which two of the Shaolin 'brothers' take to the stage in an ill-fated cabaret act.  While I'm sure this was even funnier in Cantonese, even the wonderfully descriptive subtitles demonstrated the amateur campiness of their performance (which was exactly Chow's point).<br />Plus, for any soccer/football fan the depictions of the in-game events are a joy.  All in all, Shaolin Soccer was a unexpected treat.
0156027321|4.0|Take a trip with Pi over the Pacific ocean.  His journey took 277 days, yours through the book will take less than 7.  I'm not at all being corny, this book is a really page turner, especially once you get to the second major section.  I caught myself with an absent minded fantasy about being shipwrecked.  I hope Pi doesn't read this, he wouldn't agree with me!
0066620996|5.0|This book was number one on the Wall Street Journal's list for a long time for good reason.  It is a very pleasurable and easy read that will certainly set off light bulbs in your head.  The coverage of the iterative process of buildup and breakthrough is outstanding.  If you are an executive, manager, or entrepreneur, make sure you grab this book and take it to the beach or knock it out over a weekend.  It certainly belongs in your library.
B00005B6C9|5.0|The Bee Gees released this successful album in 2001 with 5 hit songs including This Is Where I Came In, She Keeps On Coming, Sacred Trust, Man in the Middle, and Wedding Day. This last album was also performed in the live concert Live By Request. Although Maurice passed away in 2003 without finishing their next studio work, but we will still remember this musician's talent.<BR>Surely, this LP showed that the Bee Gees is capable of writing and singing different styles of songs. Technicolor Dreams showed the slow ballad, Voice in the Wilderness showed a strong rock, Embrace showed a strong jazz feeling.<BR>Barry and Robin Gibb, keep it on!
B00003CXCT|5.0|I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY ADDED NEW SPECIAL EFFECTS!  I'M SO MAD!  I, uh... um... Oh yeah, that's right, I have a life and could care less about what they do with the DVD edition of some movie I loved when I was six.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|There aren't too many movies that when I leave the cinema, I am lost for words and that anxious feeling in my stomach.  This is a very unique movie.  I reckon I recommended this to just about everyone I know.  It just seems to leave that funny feeling with you.  The way it ended was great aswell.  Good to watch something different every now and again.<br />Hats off to Kutcher for a great performance aswell, as I didn't expect him to pull this one off.  A must buy.<br />Cheers.
B00003CXCT|1.0|The box doesn't say SPECIAL EDITION, but that's what they are.  These are simply not the same films that were released from 1977-1983.  Beyond the updated effects, they are recut and revised so as to completely change the tone of the originals.  Anyone who seriously calls me or anyone else who makes this complaint a pathetic geek has his/her head so far up George Lucas' bunghole they probably have AMERICAN GRAFFITI 2 in their collection.  Face it - Demanding the originals has nothing to do with geekdom and everything to do with historical film preservation.  Not releasing the originals is big middle finger to everyone who isn't old enough to have seen them the first time around.  These \\"special\\" editions are a pale shadow of the greatness that is the original STAR WARS.  The THX laserdiscs of the originals are widely available as are used laserdisc players.  If your going to throw money down the freakin' toilet by buying these DVDs than why not spend more and get the real deal instead.  OT rules, and nothing Lucas ever does will change that, thank God.
B0001AP12G|5.0|It's an instant classic from the beginning to the end of the album.  Kanye doesn't follow the typical thug-out or booty shaking formula rhyme schemes to be a successful rapper.

B0000AUHPG|5.0|Leone went to America and started his second trilogy with this Western.  Then came A fithful of dynamite and finally Once upon a time in America.  The title for the second movie in France was Once upon a time the Revolution.  This second trilogy had this in common, titles started with the same words.  Leone was once again majestious choosing the right characters, Fonda for an unusual role in a depictable character and Bronson as the guy who doesn't talk much, like Eastwood in previous movies.  The music accompanies the image in a beautiful way like when Cardinale arrived at the train station and the camera goes up to reveal the entire city with the music taking off with the choirs.  The dust, the shootings, the rocks of Monument vallee, everything reminds of the wild west.  The first scene is perfect with these 3 men with their own story, the fly, the water drop etc...Leone wanted Eastwood, Wallach and Van Cleef to play these 3 guys.  It would be have a nice cameo after the Good the bad and the ugly.  Eastwood didn't want to be remember in Leone's movie as a guy who gets killed.  This shows how much characters are important, how much actors got involved in these movies.  Bronson plays perfectly the guy who remembers how his brother was killed.  Almost all violent scenes are not shown, just suggested, like the massacre, we only see dead bodies.  This movies was made like a Greek drama, very slowly, without a lot of dialogues, and in a very theatratical and solennal way.  This is a must see for western lovers.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I don't know why so many people out there think avril lavigne is a artist that &quot;sucks&quot;. Personally I just think they are all jelous of her stardom. She didn't try to be another gurlie pop singer. she chose to defy them all and go out on a limb and be somebody different in show busness. She has an incredible voice that almost the whole country fell in love with. I think many many people look up to avril. I don't know the title but her song that goes &quot;your everything everything that i wanted....&quot; made me think a lot about life itself and I think she is the best singer out there.......you might as well get used to her because i predict you'll be seeing/ and hearing her for a LONG time. so just everyone who loves to write bad reviews about her should just get used to her and get on the boat cause EVERYBODY  loves avril...keep rockin it avril.
B0000542D2|5.0|This could have been a \\"B\\" movie exploitation film of a short lived pop group.  Instead, it turned out to be the precursor to MTV and music videos, shows what made the Beatles so much fun and manages to play a few of their great tunes at the same time.  The plot is minimal, consisting of the Beatles entourage getting the Beatles to a live television show on which the Beatles are to perform.  Nearly from the beginning to the end, the Beatles are chased by pimple faced young teens, the police, their handlers, and everyone else.  And throughout the film, Paul's grandfather, played by William Brambell (a very clean old man), keeps stirring up problems.      The nominal plot allows the Beatles natural likeability to shine.  This film established the personas of the individual Beatles (as portrayed to the media) -- Paul -- straightforward and good natured, John -- incessantly sarcastic, George -- subtle with a dry sense of humor,  and Ringo -- quiet, shy and introspective.  The movie is irreverent, inventive, funny, droll, deadpan, filled with non-stop movement, and some great, if dated, rock-n-roll!  It is a wonderful film showing the exuberance of youth, the innocence of an earlier time, and Beatlemania in all its glory!    The DVD's extras include interviews with about everyone still living who participated in the film except the surviving Beatles.  While it is nice to have all of the insiders reminiscing about the film, it would have been nice to hear from some of the Fab Four.
B000002KFJ|2.0|Sabotage.  That sums up this album.  It is a sabotage of the Sabbath name.  Don't get me wrong I love three songs on this album and maybe a fourth but the rest is intolerable trash mostly.  Read on for a review of this piece.<br />Hole in the Sky is an excellent song that rocks you not unlike Supernaut off of Vol. 4.  It leads into the pointless Don't Start (TOO LATE) which is basically thirty seconds of tony playing acoustic guitar.  This shouldnt even be given a tracklisting and i guess it was given a tracklisting because of a shortage of material.  Anway, next you have the classic metal of Symptom of the Universe which probably would've fit in well on Master Of Reality.  This is followed by a mediocre rendition of Megalomania.  Listen to the version of this song off of Past Lives and you'll see what I mean.  It's a great song that is bogged down because of keyboards which actually prevent the song from being great.  Live the keyboards are taken out which allows the song to rock out.  This is followed by the funk of Thrill Of It All which I actually occasionally enjoy.  Then is the pointless Superztar which is basically an instrumental with an english choir singing over it.  It probably coud have been a better song but clearly the band didn't want to improve this piece of trash.  Then comes Am I Going Insane.  Yes at first most will hate this song with a vengeance but it grows on you somehow.  It's unexplainable.  Then comes 8 minutes of pointless jabber called The Writ.  This song has zero purpose except to hear the band bitching about writs and sounding like trash the whole time.  The best moment on this album must then be the 30 seconds of Blow On A Jug (an unlisted track) which is recorded after the writ at a really low volume.  It's a funny song which is the reason for half of a star.  Buy this album if you are a completist.  If you are just getting into sabbath, buy any of their first three albums.
B0001L3LUE|3.0|The Fog of War is a movie about the wars in which Robert S. McNamara played a role. First as planner of the World War II and later as part of the JFK and Johnson administration. The movie is part interviews, stemming music and war footage that support the theme of the movie that War is horror. In a way, the movie disturbs because from what Mr. McNamara is telling about the executive body. It seems to be run by quite naive people or is it Mr. McNamara that gives that impression? For example Mr. McNamara says you need to empathize with your enemy, to me that sounds as a big platitude. How else can you even think strategically? Or what to think of the fact that Mr. McNamara tries to clear his own fog of war, when he after the big conflicts, when he him self is no longer in power but his counter parts are, tries to find the truth by talking to his former opponents. Does he really think he gets answers that are context free of today's affairs? And not to mention Mr. McNamara cheap shot at saying that the US should never start a war Unilateral, clearly pointing to the war in Iraq, because Vietnam was also a Unilateral War. But what Mr. McNamara forgets to tell is that the US is not acting unilaterally in Iraq as it was in Vietnam, in Iraq the US has the support of many nations, unlike Vietnam, only not of certain former allies or of the UN. <br />This is a technical good movie, not mere anti war propaganda, but one that shows the horrors of war and the complexities that surround it. But most of all it shows the struggle of a former leader who wants to find Kantian certainty of morality, one he cannot find. To me this movie show the first steps for America to get in terms with the traumatic lost war in Vietnam.
B000000OSG|5.0|This is my review of both discs of Use Your Illusion.<br />This is flat out the best material of the nineties.  People who like all forms of music will love both these discs.  It has epic ballads (estranged, November Rain, and Don't Cry) and hard rocking classics such as You Could Be Mine, Civil War, and the underrated ten minute epic that is Coma.  It also has two excellent cover songs of the Bob Dylan classic &quot;Knocking On Heaven's Door&quot; and The Paul McCartney classic &quot;Live and Let Die&quot;.  The band is in full form throughout both of these epic discs especially Slash.  A perfect example of this is his masterful guitar work throughout November Rain.  My only real gripe with this album is the two versions of Don't Cry (one has alternate lyrics) which is simply pointless and the horrible &quot;My World&quot; which is two minutes of Axl stupidly rapping.  My World is probably the only gnr song that I absolutely, postitively hate with a vengeance.  This two disc set is a portrait of a band that was on the verge of splitting but somehow kept it together and recorded this mishmash of musical styles.  As a sidenote, I would like to state that if Chinese Democracy is ever released by Axl and his all new GNR, I would highly suggest buying it entirely because I have heard three songs that will be on the album that are all excellent.  So, if you have the means, somehow try to listen to the songs Chinese Democracy, Madagascar, and The Blues.  That's my two cents.
B0000AM6LY|5.0|It is Simply The Best!  A terrific mix of smooth jazz, upbeat blues, and slow tracks.  Fake and Home Loan Blues are fun and will get you up and moving!  Their version of You Make Me Feel Brand New will touch you and Sunrise speaks for itself.  Buy it!  Buy it!  You will not be sorry. This one should be on an award nomination list!
B000002KIK|5.0|Ah Never Say Die.  Most fans despise it.  Personally I love it.  As an album, it shows a band moving in new directions.  It really moved me unlike their previous two efforts Sabotage and Technical Ecstasy which had their moments of genius but were bogged down by some horrible material.  Now onto Never Say Die.<br />This album shows Sabbath stretching and changing, playing different forms of music better than Ecstasy.  The album starts off with an excellent punk rock esque rocker, the title track Never Say Die.  It moves and shows a band full of optimism in full form.  I really wish they still played this song live.  Next you are hit with the synth intro to Johnny Blade.  The song is a hardcore rocker that clocks in at around seven minutes and basically turns into a guitar solo jam.  Out of nowhere you are then hit by the old school blues bass line of Junior's Eyes, a song about Ozzys father which is simply old fashioned blues.  Then the hippiness of A Hard Road hits.  It is a totally optimistic hippie esque song that has the famous line &quot;why take the hard road/Why can't we be friends/No need to worry/We'll meet in the end&quot; which is the story of the band at this time in a nutshell.  then comes shock wave, another rocker which is followed by the curve ball that is Air Dance.  The song with its jazz influences ever present is a generally good song that I get a kick out of when making friends listen to it because no one believes its black sabbath until i take the cd out and have them see the disc.  Anyway, this is followed by Over to You, another rocker (sensing a pattern)  This is followed by the instrumental Breakout which is filled with horns (a black sabbath oddity again)  which serves as the intro to the Bill Ward sung Swinging The Chain.  This song ends the album on a good bluesy note as well as does a great job of sealing the end of the ozzy era.  It was sad to see the original lineup go but at least they left us with this hastily put together masterpiece.  Five stars.  Go out and buy this as well as all the sabbath albums before this and anything from the Ronnie James Dio era.  Peace.
0606027459|4.0|Matilda written by Roald Dahl is a children's book about a young girl called Matilda who is a genius. That does not seem to be a problem but her parents do not care about what she does. Her class teacher Ms. Honey is the first one who recognizes her amazing talents. She tries encourage her talents but there is a big problem at school: The head teacher Ms. Trunchbull, a former olympic hammer thrower, who has her own oppinion of educating her pupils. If she does not like a pupil's behaviour she will at once get brutal. All pupils hate her but they are not brave enough to do anything against her just until Matilda comes... <BR> Matilda is a book that is easy to understand. Roald Dahl has managed it very well to write a story about an intelligent and perfect girl without making the reader think Matilda is a swot. The character of Ms. Trunchball even makes you fear. But this is also the problem of the book: All characters behave in the same way during the whole book so that you can easily predict what the end of the story will look like. That makes the book be interesting for children but not for adults. Furthermore, the book is based on very improbable or even unrealistic facts so that it might only be good for fans of fictional books. All in all, a very good children's book but nothing else.
B000002UA0|5.0|Before The Wall, before Wish You Were Here, before Dark Side Of The Moon, before Meddle, before David Gilmour, there was the magical, psychedelic masterpiece that was Piper At The Gates of Dawn.  An album which captures Pink Floyd at its most experimental and challenging, Piper At The Gates of Dawn embraces the essence and pushes the limitations of the psychedelic sound.  Written almost entirely by guitarist Syd Barret, whose penchant for wild and reckless experimentation extended far beyond the purely musical, Piper At The Gates Of Dawn takes on a life wholly independent of other Pink Floyd albums.  <br />It is a difficult, almost feral, album filled with songs that project a view of the world that is almost childish in its naiivety, and yet, at the same time, maintains a very dark, menacing edginess.  It is an album which manages, somehow a very delicate tension between the whimsical and the sinister, a tension which, perhaps, reflects the personal turmoil of Syd Barret himself.  <br />Tough to say what might have transpired had Barret not lost the edge.  Perhaps his psychological collapse (brought about by the over-use of psychotropic drugs), was necessitated by the nature of the art he created:  a brilliance not made to last, like a star going nova.  Conjecture aside, Piper At The Gates of Dawn remains a unique artistic statement, wholly unlike anything that would be produced by the subsequent incarnation of the group following Barret's departure.  It is an album which captures, in a very real way, the nature and essence of psychedelic music, and may in fact be the best Pink Floyd album.  <br />[NOTE: for the casual Floyd fan, the incarnation of the band present on Piper At The Gates Of Dawn is the Pink Floyd you know and love in title alone.  Consequently, Piper At The Gates Of Dawn make take some getting used to, particularly for those either unfamiliar with late 60's psychedelic rock or those expecting a Darkside-esque album.]
B00005B36H|5.0|The Tool albums just keep getting better and better, every one progresses to a new level of insanity that mere mortals like myself cannot comprehend.  A testament to there god-likeness is what me and my friends like to call the scream in the grudge, the scream is a full 23 seconds long, maynard james keenan lays down a lyrical base filled in by the talents of his fellow band members that have created albums that in my opinion will not be surpassed in a long time to come.
B000002BMV|5.0|This is one of my alltime favorite Journey albums! A flick of the switch and I am back in Jr. High going to the arcade with my friends and roller skating.  A classic transport in time by one of the greatest rock and roll bands of the 80's. One that is good enough to translate easily to the youth of today as great music.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|I think that the reason some people wouldn't like this movie is because it addresses issues that are sensitive to a lot of people, and some aren't comfortable watching it. I just watched it and I found it to be a very good movie..and I don't care what anyone says, Ashton Kutcher did do a good job.
B0002I831S|1.0|First off let me say that the original series is the best. The stories were exceptional. If only they could incorporate the same sort of inspired scriptwriting in the subsequent spin-offs! The acting wasn't superb, but I think that is part of the charm. The special effects for the time were about as good as one could get, so there really should be no complaining on that point.<BR>  However, to release eight discs for around a hundred bucks is absolutely appalling.  This is clearly a money grab for Paramount. Consider that they released two episodes on a disc five years ago. They could have as easily put at least four on one disc. The DVD standard has not changed significantly, and the amount of that can be stored on a double layere disc has stayed relatively constant.<BR>  My advice is to forget this set, go to netflix or somewhere else and rent them, and then burn them. With DL discs just around the corner, you could fit just as many episodes with the same quality. This would only serve Paramount right. If they half the price, I would buy it. But until this blatant price gouging ceases, I will have none of it.
B000286RJI|5.0|Do not care what anyone says,this is the shiznit right here. People thought the first one was better. It was only because of its array of anime sprinkled in with blood squirting action. This one is more of a layed back, fill in the blanks movie. You dont have to sit threw this one then watch the first one to get it, its like its complete all on its own. Flashbacks to the past with Bill and Beatrix Kiddo fill the blanks.Pie Mei is a hoot as the white long bearded,small, old chinese guy. Subtitiles and foreign language get to be boring after awhile but once the action kicks in, in the final 2 chapters it's worth it all. The final climax with Elle and Budd is great, as Michael Madsen(in a role fit for him) gets venom from a snake in him. The plucking of the eyeball part and bitch-fight scene between Daryl Hannah and Uma Thurman was a highlight. The final chapter is longer then the rest, being the final chapter. David Carradine plays Bill to the maximum. Folks, Tarantino loves to create story and long pieces of dialouge, he knows what he is doing. Loved Bill's speech about all the superheroes. Loved Thurman all dirty and sweaty. Loved everything about this movie. A movie too good for itself. Samuel L.Jackson has a small cameo in the wedding scene. Though no one can beat Charlie Brown in the first one, he ruled. The Kill Bill scene where she pokes him in the chest was a little let down but still, great movie.
B00006JKOL|5.0|I think this album has to be one of Ians' greatest accomplishments as a songwriter. This is a perfect Tull album because it combines all of musical styles and influences and they mesh together beautifully. The title track is a tull classic. &quot;Cold Wind To Valhalla&quot; is a pure rocker that'll have you hooked after the first listen. &quot;Black Satin Dancer&quot; is a moving piece and you can even feel Ians' pain! &quot;Requiem&quot; is another great acoustic pieces that Ian became so famous for. &quot;One White Duck&quot; is a little different at first but it becomes a joy to listen to after a couple of times. &quot;Baker St. Muse&quot; is another classic Tull 16 minute epic for all the fans of TAAB or APP. &quot;Grace&quot; is just plain beautiful. Buy this CD, you'll grow to love it, I promise.
B0000X81ZI|5.0|not as much as great as Pulp Fiction or Resevoir Dogs but a lot better than Jackie Brown id say. this one has Thurman going after Bill(David Carradine) and his viper assassination squad(Vivica A. Fox, Michael Madsen, Darly Hannah and Lucy Liu). the story goes that Bill massacered his wedding and the vipers beat the crap outta Thurman and put her into a four year coma, she wakes up and goes to Fox and kills her and then we get to see cool anime sprinkled into a bloody battle of comedy and pure adrenaline. the showdown at the chinese place is great with the girl and the spiked ball and chain, all the blood oozing and the battle with Lucy Liu with a great snowy background. there's also a great vehicle called the Pussy Wagon. a must see for Tarintino fans
0736657134|5.0|Captain Aubrey is the impulsive, boyishly-jolly captain of the Sophie. His best-friend is the nerdy doctor Maturan. When Aubrey is assigned to the Sophie he convinces Maturan, a doctor in private practice, to enlist. Together they have many excellent adventures. This is the first in the series.<br />I listened to the unabridged audio version of this novel, and was VERY impressed. The narrator manages to capture Aubrey's good nature and Maturin's cheerful introspection quite well.<br />This series is very detailed. I learned plenty about the life of British sailors and the relationships between the characters is charming and at times sad. In particular, I liked  Aubrey. He has an almost cheerfully optimism that is quite infectious. Doctor Maturan is funny, but at times I wish he were more assertive.<br />Overall, an excellent book. Well narrated. Five Stars.
B00005JNA2|4.0|While standing in line at the box office two women in front of me warned me that they thought BEFORE SUNSET was so boring because \\"it was just two people walking and talking.\\" They tried to talk me out of seeing it. Of course I began to feel a bit apprehensive at their apparent negative reviews, I surely wasn't expecting such distaste from fellow movie-goers. But now looking back, I'm glad I gave little credence to them and saw BEFORE SUNSET anyways because it is simply a wonderful and beautiful film. It goes far beyond just two people walking and talking.<br />Nine years after having a one-night stand in Vienna Celine and Jesse meet up again in Paris while Jesse is on a tour promoting his new book that just happens to be about the one night he spent with Celine. While walking through the quaint Parisian gardens before his plane leaves for New York, they catch up with each other's lives since they last saw each other and it is apparent that sexual tension and an intense interest continue to exist between them. Their dialogue often drifts from displays of serious emotions to more frivolous topics, but there is an element that keeps the audience continually interested. <br />The running time is brief and the film is entirely shot in real time (there are no time lapses) thus creating a voyeuristic feeling of the audience eavesdropping on their conversation and following them through the park. Without giving anything away, the film's abrupt ending was magnificent, certainly unexpected, and honestly left me a bit frustrated. I don't know if there will be another sequel but I'm content to just leave things as they were left.<br />All in all, BEFORE SUNSET is a touching film filled with romance and wonder. Highly recommended. 4.5 stars.
0783225857|5.0|We shall say \\"To kill a mockingbird\\" is a classic of the century that unfolds reality into film with profound simplicity. Its character development along with the approach of realism supersedes many contemporary works of literature and film. The historic flavor of the film creates an impression of a southern community of America during the great depression. Apparently the quintessential theme of the movie is the social stigma and prejudice. We see conflicts between the blacks and whites in the same community where justice has upheld my one of the central character called atticus.<br />Tom Robinson, a black guy living in the same town called Mayconb was one of the central characters in the movie has been accused of raping a white woman. However, eventually he was convicted as guilty of charge and subjected to unfair justice system by the ignorant majority that have taken part in the jury. But there were other themes that also have significance to its crafts also. Its amazing reality of children's life that is so universal. It created a reality of vividing contention that helps the viewers to understand how the children see and think about the world. It also calls into attention of the activities that children by their vary nature involve in a family. For instance, Scout and Jem who are the central characters have enormous interests in scary yet joyful venture to Boo Radly's house even after being forbidden by their father. It was also important to observe how the children have collected gifts from the tree given by a isolated guy who they never been acquainted with.<br />The phenomenal curiosity of children is almost inescapable from the viewer's notice in the movie. They were inquisitive in every detail of what has been happening around them. That gives us the idea of their emotional reopens to the world and family relationships. As you will see, if you watch the movie, their father atticuls who has been a significant moral authority to them. He has great influenceon how they develop the ideas of people and differences of good and evil that remain in their fantasy world.<br />The story of the movie has a unique way to tell you about a community and what is going on to its families. It takes us to the journey to reflect on our own childhood fantasy world and the adventures that still remains in our mind a thrill.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|This is one of the best films I've ever seen! If you liked the sixth sense and other simular movies, you'll love this. Do not analyze it just sit back and enjoy. I knew Aston Kutcher was going to be a good actor; but after watching this, I can not think of any actor who could have done it better. The only word I could think of was incredible. If any critics knocked this movie then they need to get a new job, because they do not know what they are talking about.<br />This is going on my personal altime best movies list.
B000002UZ1|5.0|And there's a good reason why!  While the hits that propelled them to international stardom are the ones of which most &quot;purists&quot; salivate (i.e., the ones found on THE RED ALBUM covering 1962-1966), it is the latter stage of the FAB FOUR's career that I find most fascinating.<br />It was during this time that they were their most experimental, most challenging, and most controversial. Theirs was the music that influenced a generation and this showcases their most memorable tunes and provocative tunes.<br />I bought this three decades ago and still consider it among the best collections ever assembled.
B00004RIV4|4.0|I gotta admit that this isn't my favorite Moloko album, in fact in comparison to the remarkable &quot;Do You Like My Tight Sweater&quot; and the equally impressive &quot;I Am Not A Doctor&quot;, it's somewhat lackluster.  However, Roisin Murphy's vocals are more refined and the song-writing more heartfelt.  There are some pretty impressive tracks here though such as the steady-groovin' &quot;Pure Pleasure Seeker&quot;, the Timbaland-esque &quot;Absent Minded Friends&quot;,  the disco-infectious &quot;The Time is Now&quot; and the real-as-it-gets &quot;Mother&quot;. Other songs kinda make you want to hit the skip button, but of course this is my opinion.  Lyrically, Moloko has developed tremendously--Musically, their sound this go round is too poppish and mainstream.  Nevertheless, if you're a Moloko fan you'll dig this!
B0002BO0AS|5.0|sure i've read some reviews be it here on amazon or elsware comparing these guy and there sound to Killswitch Engage or God Forbid, I didn't mind the new KSE album , GF is in my cd case somewhere not what i was expecting but decent, now along come these guys and i've only heard about them for maybe 2 weeks. buy there cd on impulse at theendrecords, I was floored these guys blow those 2 other bands out of the freakin water, heavier, more technicall, just plain better period. So if you are into that NWOBHM (new wave of british heavy metal) or NWOAHM  (new wave of american heavy metal) like i mentioned above or even bands like Shadows fall, or Lamb of kind you will defenitly love these guys i know i did. check'm out you might be pleasently surprised like I was.
0679720200|5.0|I have never felt the need to comment on reviews posted by others on this site, but I feel that Ted Rushton's review (below) of The Stranger is a disgrace and I am amazed that Amazon have seen fit to publish his offensive and ill-informed half-witted drivel. Anyone who can use the moronic term &quot;surrender monkeys&quot; in a review of a book should confine themselves to the latest piece of trash by Frederick Forsyth and steer clear of authors of the calibre of Camus, whose ideas are clearly beyond him.<br />Even if Mersault could be seen as exemplifying the attitudes of the French people - and he clearly exemplifies nothing of the sort - Mr Rushton's anti-French tirade crumbles when you consider some facts he omits to mention. Firstly, Camus himself was active in the resistance during the war and also edited, at considerable risk, the clandestine journal Combat. Secondly Camus' The Plague is an allegory of occupation and resistance and, despite Mr Rushton's assertions to the contrary, exhibits considerable moral bravery. Then he should consider Sartre's Roads to Freedom trilogy, three books which concern themselves unflinchingly with issues of engagement, commitment and resistance.<br />In any case what philosophy could be more brave than existentialism, a philosophy that rejects the safety net of God and all other transcendental metaphysical fairy tales and insists that man is morally responsible for his own actions and the consequences thereof?<br />And by the way, as an Englishman who has travelled in France I can assure Mr R that the French do not hate the English and we - apart from a few tabliod reading idiots - do not hate them either.<br />The Stranger itself is one of the great books of the 20th Century: a masterful study of a man who refuses to conform to the false values and hypocrisy of mass self-assured organised society and ultimately pays the consequences for his bravery in refusing to &quot;fit in&quot;. The court room scene is one of the finest pieces of writing you will ever come across, and the book as a whole is beautifully written, intensely moving, and ultimately uplifting.<br />Buy the book and ignore Mr Rushton's vile &quot;review&quot;
B000002J03|3.0|This is album is mediocre, nothing like the showstopper debut. It has its moments, but it also has some down-points. The crunch-rock classic 'Whole Lotta Love' is great, and so is the LOTR-influenced 'Ramble On'. But some song are just mediocre, like the EXTREMELY boring 'Moby Dick', and the rather corny 'Thank You'. I like Zeppelin's early stuff much better than their late 70's commercial fare, but LZIV and LZI are much better than this one.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|A lot of movies imitate real ppl, real events, I guess ol'gregy overlook that point when he signed the declaration of his own amendment.  Indeed, this movie is no fast action pace movie, but, it never claimed to be.  In any case, lost in translation is not the first movie to depict ordinary ppl.  Ghost World was also about ordinary ppl, so, who cares if the ppl who watch these movies feel that it is real to them, should it be taken out of context as to appear to promote some deeper meaning as suggested by ol' gregy?  I think not, so, in a nutshell some ppl have too much time on their hands to be angry about the simple things of life. lmao!  Especially as it pertains to the real ppl.  I like this movie for its simplicity, I can actually stay still long enough to allow a movie to explain itself, without throwing fits like a 3yr old, besides, I was not looking for Bill Murray to shoot fire works out of his poop hole, just as, I was not expecting Scarlett to give everyone a hand job. lol  Lets face it, there are more ordinary ppl in the world than there are action hero's or villians.  Just look at Martha Stewart, a ordinary person, who has just as much excitement written across her forehead as green grass growing out of sand. lmao!  I personally prefer to watch more movies that truly imitate real events and not some out this world fantasy cosmic slop!  I will leave that to the pipedreamers!
B0001HAHXW|2.0|I do agree with most reviewers below re: the studio versions (the versions on this CD) being lifeless and lacking the intensity that Robert Johnson's songs require. However, you must hear the EC 2004 tour live versions of Me And The Devil, They're Red Hot, Milkcow Calf Blues, If I Had Possession Over Judgment Day, and Kind Hearted Woman Blues.  Clapton coverning the blues needs to be heard live - most of Eric's classic performances of the great blues songs are best heard live. (exception: Derek and the Dominos studio versions of Key To the Highway and Have You Ever Loved a Woman).<br />I give this CD 2 stars due to the lame production. However, it was a great concept. They just needed to perform these 14 songs in front of a live audience and recorded the result!!<br />Go see Eric if he is plays your hometown.
B00005JKJA|3.0|I consider myself to be a pretty smart individual, but, I must agree with Patrick, this movie made sense until almost to the end.  Then, it went in another direction, I couldnt tell if the main character was having a dream or was it all real for her, well, I did enjoy the two women licking each other.  After watching this movie it left me with that puzzled look. lol  Even still, it was a good movie, if anyone likes movies like this, I would reccomend, ( running on Karma ) this is a great Cantonese movie about incarnation and the Karma it entails, a better movie by far,(easier to follow).
B000268QB2|5.0|I can honestly say that this album is one of the best I've ever heard. I can't even remember now where I first heard or saw the name Keane, but it was just recently that I visited their website and listened to a few clips. For days I was singing those little tunes in my head and I knew that I had to get the CD. The music of Keane out-does Coldplay (which has always been a fav band of mine). I almost hope that they never do add guitar because the simple beauty of the piano is so important to the music. Not to mention Tom Chaplin's gorgeous voice. I can't wait for their next US tour (they just finished their first)!
B00008NRI8|5.0|I dont know what movie you guys watched but it wasnt the the HG/SB version of Two Weeks Notice.  This was a great movie.  Plot driven? No.  But full of clever on liners and a blossoming affection between George and Lucy thats adorable and infectious.  My girlfriend and i still do the &quot;I find you...annoying.&quot; line once in a while.  Just the other day as a matter of fact.  I even watch it occasionally when shes not around.  Norah Jones does a great cameo and Georges eccentricities, coupled with Lucy's everything is a cause mindset, is great.  They're so opposite its wonderful.
B0000CABBW|5.0|I cried-- no, strike that -- I SOBBED when I saw this movie. And I've never shed a tear for ANY movie before I saw Whale Rider. Honestly. I'm as emotional as Sally Jesse Raphael. <br />Whale Rider, in my opinion, is one of the greatest movies I've ever seen. Beautifully displayed with an essence of wisdom and charisma, Whale Rider will leave every movie bearer breathless and wanting more. The film itself is a grand reminder of why movie lovers love movies. If you've ever wanted to be moved by a motion picture, this is the one to carry you.

B00009V8Z9|5.0|I had never heard of Gavin Degraw until One Tree Hill premeired. (I love that show) so of course I wondered who sang the theme song.

B00005QDW5|5.0|echoes is one of the best greatest hits compilation which you will get of any band and for me it is their best compilation as it contains all their great songs like echoes,comfortably numb,money and the tygers of pan tang with sorrow.very highly recommended.
B0001Z52RU|1.0|Ok  let's get real Suspense maybe. Good acting I think not. This is just one of those movies that people go OH!MY!GOD this movie is great but I would bet money that in 1 or 2 years you will see loads of this movie used for like$7.99. For example Signs nobody talks about this suppossed suspense movie anymore and it sells for $7.99 because it is not a hit anymore. I think anybody who likes these movies has Really..........Bad Taste......... You want Suspense  and Disturbance See Possession with Sam Neil That is Good Acting.Ashton Kutcher just can't act he Ranks up there with ALL THE OTHER BAD ACTORS IN MOVIES TODAY.Sorry this movie just did not entertain me. I would have rate this 0 stars but unfourtanely I could only rate it 1.
B00004SVID|5.0|live music cant get any better than this compilation.this double cd features almost all my favourite songs like hey you,run like hell,comfortably numb.you should own this terrific compilation if you like good rock music.very highly recommended.
B0002KQNL8|5.0|I really think this is the best out of all the return of the living dead movies. <BR>1.You get to see more zombies.<BR>2.It is more entertaining ,and fun.<BR>3.There is more gore.<BR>The first one most of the zombies were covered in mud as with this one the movie has more better make up effects. Sure it is cheesy but that is what i like about. I am so glad this is finally coming out on dvd if you truly love zombie movies this is definately worth having in your collection because the just don't make fun,good or creative horror movies like this anymore.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|lost in translation is a ball of nothingness. it lacks story, talent and over all film development. it focuses on two depressed and bored people in Japan, sadly by the end of the film they were happy and we were bored and depressed. i can tell that most reviews for this film is either a love/hate relationship or an i just don't give a crap. i think the main reason this film did well is because people are unsatisfied by the end, so they essentially feel that there is a big catch to it, but i can safetly say that there is not, its a 50 year old and a 25 year old having fun together, which is rare because they are so depressed. the main catch is that he feels youth while hanging around with her and she sees him as a fatherly figure. they fall in love at the very end, but then they say no, (how great), an hour and a half of them doing nothing funny or interesting and we're waiting for them to get together and then they say no. even if they had gone off together it would be a two star rating, but they said no, making an obvious choice of one star rating. Total boring crap, if you haven't seen it don't bother its about as interesting as staring at a wall for an hour and forty minutes, from Pete.
0345446798|5.0|I love this book! Patricia McConnell brings a very human touch to writing about dogs, reminding us that while we are not perfect, neither are our dogs. This book should be read by everyone thinking about getting a dog, since it really gets into the way a dog's mind works.<br />I found this a very enjoyable read. I liked the real-life examples McConnell uses and how she isn't the &quot;perfect&quot; dog trainer and lets us know that.
B00001ZWTT|1.0|Paint a mustache on the Mona Lisa! It's a shame and sad that  this movie was made cause it will never have the opportunity to be made right. The TV James West was the perfect wild west secret agent with the gadgets and brawls. Robert Conrad created a wonderful character only to be mocked in this vomitus, stick to the bottom of your shoe movie. Save your money on this and buy some of the real TV episodes. Find &quot;The Night of the Falcon&quot; with Robert Duvall as the foil to James West - perfect example of how this should have been made.<br />Just Vin
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I am SF fan and always love a good story.  These stories have what I call John Wayne ethics.  A rare commodity, a program that a young person can watch, get something out of it, and still enjoy the adventure. For the older watcher fun stories. I wish there were more. I do not find anything on TV that is worth watching, but this, this is truly refreshing.  I think that the casting was great, each actor perfect for the role, each charactor perfect for the part.<BR>Thanks Joss Whedon and the entire cast.
B000268QB2|5.0|Man, what a refreshing band, music built on lyrics and melodies that make an evening with your girl listening to this very nice;]
B00005V3Z4|5.0|This is everithing movie shoud be. It has perfect story(a very hard one), perfect actors, perfect director, cool special effects and a suspence. This is my N.1 movie. And music is just awesom. Especial MAD WORLD  witch explains the story pretty much. I think that JAKE GYLLENHAAL is the best new actor. Donnie Darko is a sad, funny, Sci-Fi Cult Classic. I Rate this one A+.
B0000B1OFL|4.0|This is a movie plenty of action. The script runs about an old thief who decides make the las robery. Thirty five millions in gold is a great temptation . But suddenly there will be a twist of fate.<br />Wonderful locations and excellent special effects. Shuterland as always, steals the show. Walberg is OK and the cosmic beauty of Charlize Theron plays a convincing role.<br />There are many hair raising sequences.<br />A good entertainment but without the punch of the previous version from the sixties.
B00006LLNU|5.0|please stop reading the reviews and buy this album.  words cannot do it justice--as the members of sigur rs recognized also.  you need to hear this work of art for yourself.  every single track on this album is just everything more than astonishing.  i love every single track.  i love the keyboards in track one.  i love the singing in track two.  jonsi your voice is fn breathtaking.  i love the keyboards and melodies in track three.  i love track four, hands down.  i love the eerieness of track five, oh man i love how he sings.  i love the ending of track six. beauty.  track seven is just...just close your eyes and listen. you will know.  and track eight. what to say about track eight? track eight is fn awesome.  all of these tracks are amazing. i am not singling any of them out for a standout or any of them for a track of lesser beauty.  amazing album.  honestly.  get this one.
0385510438|4.0|I have read many John Grisham books and although this was not my favorite, it did not disappoint. It did not have the same suspense as The Firm (another Grisham book), but it was a good book. The beginning stars out slow, but gradually picks up its pace. Shortly you will notice your attention being shifted from the main story line to a subplot about a woman with outstanding children. You may forget almost completely about main story until they are intertwined. Overall this is  good book, but not the best Grisham out there.
B00005JL1C|4.0|1987's Some Kind Of Wonderful is a gender-revised version of 1986's Pretty In Pink.  Eric Stoltz takes the place of Molly Ringwald and Lea Thompson &amp; Mary Stuart Masterson do the same for Andrew McCarthy &amp; Jon Cryer.  Mr. Stoltz plays Keith a loner, artistic type who works at a garage and whose best friend is a tom girl, drummer Watts played by Ms. Masterson.  Keith pines after Amanda Jones (Ms. Thompson), one of the most popular girls in school.  Amanda dates the spoiled rich boy Hardy Jenns (Craig Sheffer) and after they fight, Keith swoops in and asks Amanda for a date, to which she agrees.  Keith finds out that the whole date is just a setup to get him to Jenns' house so he can beat him up, he still continues with the date.  He sets an elaborate evening, dinner at a fancy restaurant, art museum after hours and a set of diamond earrings.  It turns out that Amanda isn't some spoiled rich girl, but a girl from the wrong side of the tracks who sold herself out for popularity.  All the while, Watts is secretly in love with Keith and in the end after a showdown at Jenns' house where he is exposed as a chicken and fraud, Keith realizes his true feelings for Watts and they kiss.  The movie is filled with nice performances by the three leads, but it is the supporting players that give the best performances.  John Ashton is perfectly gruff and pushing as Keith's dad, Maddie Corman is the classic, annoying younger sister, but Elias Koteas steals the show as Duncan, the school thug who befriends Keith.  Mr. Koteas throws out some classic lines.  This was the last film John Hughes would write or director in the classic 80's teen angst vein.  The soundtrack to the film is excellent, featuring no name bands like Flesh For Lulu, The Licking Tins and Furniture and it captures the essence of the films.
9875503835|2.0|I had to read this book for summer reading.  The rough storyline is that Frankenstein has created life from dead body parts.  In horror, he rejects the creature, and the creation vows revenge on Frankenstein.  Considering the idea of the book, it sounds interesting.  The writing, however, was extremely boring.  It took me a few chapters to get into the book, and then once I was a little intrigued, I would be bored all over again.  Mary Shelley seems to write on endlessly about things that are insignificant to the plot, complicating basic understanding.  On top of that, things that I thought would be important, such as Frankenstein's wedding, were summed up in about 2 sentences.  The emphasis in her book seemed to be off-center, and thus it was very hard to pay attention.  The book itself is very short, I believe only 200 pages or so, but it felt like it was much longer.  I pity you if you are forced to read this for school (which many are), and I do not recommend this book for leisure reading--there are many other, much better written &quot;classics&quot; out there.
0553260111|5.0|Ludlum surpasses not only himself but all other spy thriller writers for all times to come. I started in 1977 with Scarlatti Inheritance and have ever since been hooked to Ludlum. But Bourne Identity exploded on me like no other book or experience I had. It is more than a spy story or about a person called Bourne trying to fight tremendous odds with a total memory loss with bursts of memory flashes of the violent past with layers of different personalities. It is about human mind itself discovering its way using the ultimate training of the past to protect it and achieve the objective imprinted in the psyche. The events will linger forever in the mind and you will be hungry to read another book which can match this book. Yes! Read it ,Enjoy it and be haunted by it. <br /> <br />I also recommend: all the other Bourne books along with most of the early Ludlum (I'm not crazy about his later stuff).
B000021XS0|5.0|Now this is a fine piece of music from start to finish.I love the begining of this with great use of stereo sound.This is probably there best cd out there.There last two have not lived up to this release.Buy this and piece the story together,if you can.
B0001XTIUO|5.0|hmmm... she does have a joni mitchell thing about her, but more like if joni and nick drake spent the winter writing songs together. then there's a grace slick feel, with a proto-ann-and-nancy-wilson groove. and yoko ono came by the studio one day. maybe. i mean all of this in the best way possible. this should have been a record famous for its innovative blend of folk and psychedelia. i don't know why it's been buried for so long. linda perhacs' voice is beautiful. buy it.
B000069CIM|5.0|The music is rich in sound and makes you want to wear headphones at night with no distractions. I recently started playing all my older Plant CDs and then found this one at the store and was BLOWN AWAY. Yes it's mainly cover songs but the production values are well worth the listen, and he does justice to Dylan's One More Cup of Coffee from the Desire album (my fave Dylan album). Morning Dew is a sad but beautifully done song, and Plant's interpretation of Hey Joe is quite different from the one we're used to ala Hendrix but if listened to on its own merits it is still very good, relying more on Plant's voice to build it up with the music mainly keeping the beat and rhythm until the lengthy bridge section then it goes very Led Zeppelin. All in all an excellent CD well worth taking time away from everyone and dusting off that big old set of headphones you may have laying around somewhere.
B00003CX95|5.0|I have made many top 10 movie lists, and they have changed over the years. There is one movie, however, that has never been moved and that movie is Braveheart in the number 1 spot. Many shy from the movie because of it being 3 hours long without even giving it a chance.I think everyone should watch it. You never think the movie is as long as it is when you actually watch it.  The battle sequences were the best I have ever seen up until the release of Return of the King, but the battles are still the best in their own light. Every characater is played well, Mel Gibson playing especially well as the lead character William Wallace and his directing is flawless as well. I loved every minute of it and it will most likely always be my favorite movie of all time.
B00000IPAX|5.0|This is a great cd! But it isnt like their older stuff. Their older stuff was more punk-like. But this cd leans towards a more pop-rock like. This cd is what made them HUGE. It has such great songs as Adams Song, Aliens Exist, Whats My Age Again, Dupweedl, and of course All the Small Things. Although it is a new Blink 182 style it is still blink. I love this cd just as much as their older stuff. Overall its a great cd.
078693123X|4.0|This is the first book I've read that's written by R.A. Salvatore and also the first I've read in the Forgotten Realms and to tell the truth I wasn't expecting much. I don't usually read books in big series like Forgotten Realms, and the only reason I read it was because my friend said it was better than the book I was reading at the time and I was eager to prove him wrong. I was however, surprised by how much I enjoyed the book, except for the beggining, which I found slow moving and boring. R.A. Salvatore's portrayal of the dark elf soceity was vivid and cruelly real. The whole soceity seems planned out and carfully thought about. The writing of the book is pretty good, but not great, but that's not stopping me from reading the other two books in the dark elf trilogy as soon as I can get my hands on them.
B000002KKC|5.0|Let's set the scene: It's 1979. 2 years ago, Fleetwood Mac had released \\"Rumours.\\" A riveting musical soap opera, it topped the charts for 31 weeks, sold 12 million copies at the time (19 million to date) and launched 4 MONSTER hit singles. The group (actually, it was probably more just Lindsey Buckingham) decided to do a complete 180. The result was \\"Tusk.\\" This album probably had more hype surrounding it when it came out than any other album ever made at that point. It debuted strongly, but only peaked at #4. After this, it didn't last long, burning out at 2 million copies. What was going on?<BR>One: 1979 was an infamously slow year for album sales.<BR>Two: The double-album was priced at an expensive-for-the-time $16.<BR>Three: A national radio station played the album in it's entirety, so anyone with a recorder could get it for free.<BR>Four: The album was nothing like Rumours, and people \\"didn't get it.\\"<BR>While all of these probably had to do with it, the fourth reason is probably the most relevant in this case, which is a shame, because this album is better than \\"Rumours.\\"<BR>Lindsey Christine and Stevie push their boundaries on this album to excellent results. Sara is a gem, but I DO reccomend just downloading the original version. Christine still offers her pop-flavored music, but it has more depth here. Lindsey is just cracked out and it shows on his songs. But then, the songs are all good. <BR>I have this album on vinyl and CD. I love the \\"sleeve within a sleeve within a sleeve\\" concept. The collages and conceptual photographs also make for interesting art. And what is with the dog?<BR>Very few artists have the guts to follow a massive album with a totally non-commercial follow-up. Alanis Morissette did this with Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie, which is Tusk 19 years later. Supposed is a great album, which I also reccomend. But Tusk is a star because it was experimental, honest, raw, and it was totally ahead of its time. <br />Buy it. It may take a few listens to warm up to, but it's something that demands attention and gives so much back to the listener.
B00008S2VG|2.0|Madonna is out of tune on so many songs here. From Love Profusion to Nothing Fails. The songs lack inspiration, and imo, this current release is about 10 Giant Steps back from her ROL CD. I never thought Madonna was that good of a singer, but her music was danceable...not so on American Life. I listened to this a few times, and haven't put this in my CD player since May of 03.
B000024D4R|4.0|Wow!  This album is absolutely awesome.  While it is not quite the caliber of DSOTM and WYWH, I believe that this album ranks beside its counterpart The Wall.  In fact Animals is somewhat like The Wall, except for the fact that it is much more sophisticated musically.  The only reason that I do not give this album 5 stars is the length of the songs.  I can understand 10 minutes for Pigs and Sheep, but 17 minutes for Dogs, come on.  I am not saying that Dogs is a bad song.  In fact, it is probably one of the best on this album.  However, it does seem a bit long.  PLEASE, DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ALBUM IF YOU ARE JUST BEGINNING TO LISTEN TO PINK FLOYD.  First, get albums like DSOTM (Darkside of the Moon for those who are confused) and WYWH (Wish you were here)under your belt before graduating to Pink Floyd's darker chapter AKA Animals and The Wall.  I guarantee that if this the first PF album that you listen to, it will be the last.  PF is much more sophisticated than many modern and retro bands, so please give it a chance.  You have to listen to their albums more than once to really enjoy them.  <BR>    As for the songs on Animals, here is a small summary of each one:<br />1.  Pigs on the Wing: A very good, small intro for the three songs following it.  The acoustics here sound a lot like Wish You Were Here, the cover song for the album of the same title. The lyrics here are nice but a little confusing.  You will understand them by the end of the album.<br />2.  Dogs:  An extremely good song.  The guitar here really demonstrates Gilmour coming into his own.  This is the beginning of great PF guitar songs that would peak at The Wall's Comfortably Numb.  <br />3.  Pigs (Three Different Ones):  Great song.  However, the pig sounds throughout it are somewhat scary, as they seem to pop out in unlikely places.  Great guitar and good keyboard.<br />4.  Sheep:  This song begins with a killer keyboard.  Absolutely awesome.  Make sure to listen carefully for the depraved version of the Lord's Prayer.  Really creepy!  This song has a good message, but I'll let you figure it out!<br />5.  Pigs on the Wing PT2:  This song is exactly like the first, with different lyrics.<br />There are some who complain that Animals is the beginning of a series of albums that are \\"Roger Waters shows\\".  Well, Animals is a Roger Waters show.  But this is a show where the opening acts (David Gilmour's guitar and Richard Wright's keyboard) are as good as the headliner.<BR>    Really, if you have listened to other Pink Floyd albums, please do yourself a favor and get Animals.

0060273224|4.0|Sabriel is a creative, well-written fantasy for teen readers, the first published effort of Australian author Garth Nix.  The majority of it is a wonderful read; unfortunately, it loses its freshness and momentum toward the end and fizzles to an abrupt, unsatisfying conclusion.  My take on the good and the not-so good:<br />The Good<br />** Fresh, detailed setting and magic system.  The story takes place in an alternate, early 20th century England, with a vast counterpart of Hadrian's Wall separating the country from the Old Kingdom, in which magic (called Charter magic) is a reality and the dead tend not to stay dead.  Sabriel's father, a necromancer who banishes the dead, disappears and calls to her for help.  Armed with his enchanted sword and seven bells, which have power over the dead, Sabriel enters the Old Kingdom and confronts a powerful, growing evil.<br />** Good, descriptive writing, featuring several wonderful similes and metaphors.<br />** A true teen novel, with direct (if more or less irrelevant) references to drinking and sexuality.<br />The Not-so Good<br />** Flat characterization, including a semi-passive protagonist: Sabriel has no truly defining character traits.  For the most part, she is simply cool and competent, except when the action requires her to get worked up.  She makes few true choices; answering a father's call for help is hardly a choice, and once in the Old Kingdom, she more or less bounces from point A to B to C.<br />** Confusion as to key fantasy elements: the double-edge of the creative setting.  Nix leaves the exact nature of Charter magic for the reader to puzzle out, and the background of the (again, two-dimensional) villain is hastily glossed over.<br />** Reliance on coincidence: at two major points, in the middle and climax, the plot turns on sheer happenstance, forcing the reader to frown and mutter \\"Huh?\\"<br />** Lack of resolution: several minor plot threads seem unresolved after the abrupt ending.  As good as the majority of the novel was, I felt as if someone came and yanked away my four-course supper during the third course.  Perhaps this was done to set up the next book (Lirael) in the trilogy, but perhaps I won't be reading that one.<br />Despite these flaws, I do recommend Sabriel for teens and adults who enjoy fantasy fiction.  The combination and contrast of the Old Kingdom (and the realm of the Dead) and the early twentieth century military outpost that guards the wall is a true addition to the genre, and the necromancer's bells are a fine grace note.

0312995423|3.0|I like techno-thrillers from the likes of Robin Cook and Michael Crichton, so I enjoyed this book, and read it as a prelude to The Da Vinci Code.<br />I figured out the &quot;North Dakota&quot; connection about a quarter of the way through and knew right away what number was being sought at the end.  The book did OK in feeding the left side of my brain, but I got a little weary of the seemingly endless cliffhangers--who could possibly get themselves out of the frying pan and into the fire THAT many times, even in fiction??!?!?!<br />BTW, can anyone give me a hint about how to decipher the code at the end of the book?  I'm wracking my brain, but nothing about the story I just read comes to mind as an aid.  If you can help without giving too much away, e-mail me: dathaler at cox-dot-net.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|This is such an enjoyable movie to watch.  I enjoyed the lifetime adventures of Edward Bloom, told through a series of flashbacks, which were so romantic and fun.  I loved Ewan McGregor's performance as the young Bloom; he was charming and innocent, like a child in a fantasy or fairy tale world.  Albert Finney's performance as the mature Bloom was spot on, as he took every available opportunity to tell and re-tell his stories;  I only wish he'd had more stories to share.  I think the \\"secret\\" to enjoying this movie thoroughly is that there is no secret, instead just go with it and stop trying to figure out the meanings.  And it doesn't matter whether these events actually happened or not - if that's what you spent the entire movie wondering about and waiting to find out, you were missing the point and cheating yourself out of a great movie; no wonder you're complaining about it now.  Personally, this movie struck just the right chord with me probably because my own father, who was a fantastic story teller himself, died this last spring and I thought I saw a lot of him in the Edward Bloom character.  I was so impressed with this movie that I bought copies of it to send to my siblings for Christmas as a gentle reminder of those times spent listening to our own father's tales.  Thanks to Tim Burton and his ever-blooming imagination...hehehe...get it, bloom...
0679777547|4.0|When I was ordering this novel, the storyline seemed oddly familiar.  When I received the book and examined the jacket cover, I realized that not too long ago I saw a movie that had to have been based on it.  The movie was \\"The Ninth Gate\\" with Johnny Depp.  Knowing since childhood how much worse movies are than the books they depict, I found myself - rather unusually - in a situation of having seen the movie first, which made me hesitate, as some of the suspense of traveling through a new book, especially one representing the adventure genre, was necesarily missing.  Of course, I didn't dwell on the feeling too long and plunged right in, and very quickly the book fleshed itself out from the bones of its Hollywood double.  If you think that knowing the movie will keep you from enjoying this book (as if any movie could ever really do justice to a book!), please reconsider.      Aside from a smart, erudite and engrossing storyline, this book goes on to subtly examine the roles of writer, reader and narrator, with all the attendant critical dilemmas of perspective, genre, fictional boundaries, originals and copies, story-within-a-story - reading oneself into one and writing oneself out, with the resulting constant feeling of the author's wink and smile as you read on, especially at the unmasking. If you don't read with such collegiate thoughts in mind, such ideas will not hinder what is just a good read, so read anyway.    Of course, the book is much more magnetic and seductive if you have ever lost your heart to a Dumas novel.  So there is no question that part of why I enjoyed it as much as I did is that one particular Dumas novel is one of my favorite books of all time.  If you feel the same, even if you may be slightly embarrassed at what seems like a light choice of favorite, don't be: certainly, the \\"actual\\" Club Dumas of the novel will make you feel in good fictional company.  If you consider yourself more of a \\"serious\\" reader, the lit. crit. possibilities I mentioned should make up for what appears to be a light read.  It's a book lover's book, a \\"reader's\\" book, and as such extremely well done.  Enjoy.
0316168815|5.0|The Lovely Bones is one of the best books I have read in a long time.The first chapter so disturbing that I got goosebumps when I read it. However, if you can get past chapter one, the rest of the book is very enjoyable to read. Mrs. Sebold was observant enough in her writing to focus on all the parts of a teenager's life. Sebold shows the emotional challenges in the Susies family of dealing with her death. I cried when Mr. Salmon smashes the ships in bottles that Susie and he had built together; and when Susie reveales herself in the shattered glass, there is a transitory gleam of hope. Each character in the story must accept Susie's death in their own way, but Susie's family has the most difficult struggle. Sebold also shows us the mind and disturbing behavior of a killer. I'm glad Sebold focused on Mr. Harvey because it gives us as readers and glimpse of his motives for murduring people. This a book not only about death, but also about life. I was a little disappointed that Susie's heaven wasn't paradise, but I got the impression that she went to a better heaven after she let go of the grief of being away from earth. In this way, I believe that Sebold still wants us to have our own image of heaven. Sebold was also careful to show the distinction between sex and rape. Susie's spirit possesses Ruth's body, and while Susie is on Earth she has sex with Ray. In this way, I think Sebold is trying to say that sex is something that needs to be valued and not abused. There are many messages in this book, but most of all I think it is a reflection of life. We all can relate to this book. Read it.
B00005JMYG|2.0|It stars the hilarious Will Ferrell, is co-anchored by the gorgeous Christina Applegate, features cameos by buddies Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, and Luke Wilson, and the story is about the television profession, in which I've worked for many years.  Yet, somehow, the lead story never hooked me.  As it is often the case with news promos, it stands true for the trailer:  The story sounds riveting until you see the final piece.  The moments of adlib are quite funny, but too much of the film strays away from its original point.  Had the script continued to focus more on the job and less on the love connection, I think the film makers would have had better results.  I am, however, glad to see the lovely Miss Applegate in a role that proves she has more talent than her \\"dumb blonde\\" typecast. All in all, wait to rent ANCHORMAN, preferably on a \\"slow news\\" night.
B00020HEG6|5.0|While John Williams' sountrack complements the movie perfectly, most of the tracks would fit in at a Boston Symphony concert.  &quot;Aunt Marge's Waltz&quot; is probably the best example of this; the oboe solos, etc, make this track sound like a modern version of a Mozart waltz.<BR>&quot;Buckbeak's Flight&quot; is easily the best track on the album; it conjures up the scene from the movie perfectly.  I can't help but smile when I hear it.<BR>What I don't understand is why people have such an affinity to lyrics.  &quot;Double Trouble&quot; is the most downloaded track on iTunes, &quot;Into the West&quot; (awful song) was the most popular for LOTR, and same with every other soundtrack.  While I have nothing against &quot;Double Trouble&quot; (it is is a great adaptation of those few lines from Macbeth), it somehow doesn't fit with the rest of the album.  It works great in the film, but it doesn't fit with the other tracks.  Same with &quot;Knight Bus.&quot;<BR>Sorry this turned out to be a rant more than a review; just had to say that.
B0001ZX0PG|2.0|Amazing Tale, but... Why did I Feel Lost in the Mystic River of Nonsense?<br />This is an absolutely amazing tale along with some of the finest performances a movie has ever had. However, with a horrible screenplay and an even more horrible ending, I was lost and angry in the \\"mystic river\\" of nonsense.<br />Without going into any detail, I can only say that after a two-hour session, I have more questions than answers. One being the most important, what does this film try to tell us?<br />Is it a slice of great entertainment like X2 or Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (unlikely with all the sorrows in it)? Or is it up to the suspenseful feelings that a movie called \\"the Usual Suspects\\" once gave us? Or is it on the scale of morality and justice such as \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" or \\"Path to War\\"? <br />The answer, none of the above. To capture this film in the simplest terms, it fails to grasp the noblest and the highest attention one would have had. Packing on with so much sidetracks and a terrible downplay of the moral issues, it leaves me with a whole lot of dissatisfactions and disappointment. I doubt the filmmakers intentionally tried to swirl around that most important issue, morality. But I do question their way of looking and closing in on this story. <br />In fact, an amazing tale and a tragic life have been, at least film wise, demolished by the brutal reality of self-survival and self-righteousness, which are, after all, rather important. But considering what kind of a message it will send when a murder is not only justified but also paraded (literally)!<br />Unless the filmmakers are into the weakest kind of shoulder rubbing and a celebration of disillusion, hardly ever but this time, I've agreed with the Academy for awarding only Penn and Robbins out a whole list of nominations.
B00009W0WM|4.0|Ah, kids today.  \\"Man, it's crap if there's no color to assist my info-ladened cranium!\\"  Get a life.  It's \\"Casablanca\\", for God's sake.  It NEEDS to stay in B&W format.  And, might I say, this film is a cult classic for more reasons than just minimalist acting.  Dialogue:  Heard of it, kids?  It's what actors used to do instead of blowing (...)up or flying through the air in front of a blue screen.  I love my DVD of \\"Casablanca\\", and cherish the fact that I don't have to rewind a tape to get to some of my favorite quotes.
B0001ZX0PG|1.0|Nothing says &quot;Message Movie&quot; like a big dialogue ending. Stink-o-rama.<br />I  had been looking forward to seeing this movie ever since I missed it in theaters; now I wish I had missed it entirely.
630529142X|5.0|The Waterboy is a movie that doesn't require a lot of brain power to figure out, but it's loaded with comedy and hilarious lines from Adam Sandler. One particular part of the movie that I love is when he is in a college class dealing with the agression center of animals and Bobby is asked why alligators are such aggressive creatures. Since his Mama was supposedly right about everything, his answer was &quot;Mama says that alligators are angry 'cause they got all those teeth and no toothbrush.&quot; That's comedy, man! Simple comedy, maybe, but it's funny all the same! This is definitely a must-have for any Adam Sandler fan. If you don't like Adam Sandler, then you're not going to like this movie. End of story.
B000003TA4|5.0|YOU HAVE TO OWN THIS CD.  Its perfect in every way.  Dave Ghrols powerfull drums, Krist Knoviselics solid bass lines,  Kurt Cobains awsome guitar solos and screaming vocals.  There is no duplicate of Nirvana.  i've heard other bands try to play smells like teen spirit and its almost imposible to make it sound anywere near as good. Some good tracks are Smells Like Teen Spirit, In Bloom, Come As You Are, Polly, Lithium, and Lounge Act.
B00000K3UU|5.0|This is a great movie, all around. It's got comedy like every Adam Sandler movie, but it's also got a real show of heart. I mean, what are you supposed to do when a kid shows up on your doorstep and you're told that he's your roommate's son, but your roommate is off on a business trip? Julian is an adorable little guy, and you can really see that he got attached to Sonny, only to be told that he had to go away by the social services. That tugs at the heartstrings, especially when Julian is being led out of Sonny's apartment by the social worker repeating &quot;But I wipe my own ass!&quot;, thinking that it was his fault he had to go away. Adam Sandler's character really showed a soft side when he gave that speech in court when it was going to be decided whether Julian would stay with him or with the adoption services. Overall, it's a wonderful movie.
B000069HK2|4.0|Wow.  This CD is so loud and powerfull.  The vocals alone blow you away. I heard the used live and i thought they wouldnt be as power full as they were on the CD but they were and they kicked ass.  If you ever get a chance to see them live do it.  Songs like the Taste Of Ink and Poetic tragedy are really basic but the vocals add so much to the songs.  good tracks are &quot;taste of ink&quot;, &quot;poetic tragedy&quot;, &quot;burried myself alive&quot;, and &quot;box full of sharp objects&quot;.  There is also a secret track on this CD.  After the last song you have to wait about 5 minutes and then you will here the band talking and about a minute later the song starts.  But if you like bands like Taking Back Sunday you will like this CD.
B00008S2VG|5.0|My favorite one has to be LOVE PROFUSION, I cant believe there is such a precious song this year! This song and HOLLYWOOD  have been sleeper hits in my hometown, and have been overplayed here for months and months throughout  this year: madonna might not be doing it on Billboard, but she is working it out perfectly in the most unsuspected corners of the world!!!!<BR>I think that not even Madonna realizes how beautiful LOVE PROFUSION  is, since she did not include it in her Re-Invention Tour( so I am told)...Lovely song,very cool album, I can tell you that there are many people who have been touched by some of the songs on this album, which ultimately is what should matter when it comes  to music...right?<BR>Thank you madonna for these songs,please,give us more, to the many ones who still consider you the hottest woman in music...I mean:Who says that in this era of electronica you have to have an operatic voice to make stand-out songs????? Is more like the personal touch of the composition what makes them prevail, I think...And very few people create songs like the ones on AMERICAN LIFE  album, as bubbly,catchy, and oozing so much distinctiveness and personality...thank u Madonna for your gorgeous songs.
B00028HBKM|5.0|I have to say that this is the best movie I have ever seen.  I feel that this movie is so powerful because it is true.  It may not be 100% accurate, but the message and the feeling behind it is the truth.  This is to date, the best portrayl of Christ's final hours ever put on film.  Since it was directed by Mel Gibson and stars Jim Caviezel, you know that alot of time and effort, and research, went onto the making of this film.  I think that any creed of Christianity should see this and know exactly what was done for us.  My only complaint, and it is minor,it that there wasn't more shown in the garden of Gethsemene, since it was it fact the most important part of His sacrifice.  But other than that, it is perfect.  I was crying though out the entire movie, so I recommend a box of tissues.
B000189WO6|5.0|This is the best album Ive bought in years.....wait, in my life!<BR>I give it 7 stars.<BR>Also buy the Tremulant EP.
B000002H6C|5.0|I havent heard all the songs off this album yet since I dont own it but, a good portion of them are good so far. The famous single One is the stand out track of the entire album other great songs like Harvester of Sorrow,To live is to Die a kik a$$ instrumental,Dyers Eve, And Justice for all im not going to list them all but i think this album will blow away any new Meatllica fan or someone who hasnt heard the album but likes Metallica. I give this album five stars since the quality is so great compared to the others. The bass drums sound so loud. The earlier albums are great too I recommend picking up Master of Puppets,Kill em all,Ride the Lightning and Black Album be warned all the albums after Black album are really different they are good just be warned Metallica makes drastic changes to their sound in the mid 90's albums. Metallicas newest effort ST. Anger is horrible unless you like crap music then dont buy it.Metallica is now trying to sound like all the nu-metal bands out there with the howling and screaming vocals and Lars's drums sound like total crap.
B000083E79|1.0|please get rid of this cd and this old woman who should call it a day.it is a shame to call this package of 21 terrible songs as best of collection as to me it sounds more like lousy hits.trash this immediately.avoid.
B000089RV6|4.0|Brians first album with AC/DC. This album has some great songs on it Back in Black, Shoot to Thrill,Hells Bells and a many others the only dumb song on this album is Givin the Dog a Bone a really cheesy track indeed. I reccomend getting the remastered version over the original CD release. Epic has also re-issued all of AC/DCs albums on high quality vinyl so go and get this classic gem.
B000083E79|1.0|i would request that this is one album which you should avoid at all costs.this awful cd is bad beyond description and i really wonder when this old woman will call it a day and stop harrasing us.she only became famous because of her short lived association with the great greg allman.avoid.rating 1/2 out of 10.get rust in peace from megadeth instead.
B00008BXJG|4.0|High Way to Hell is great every single song is worth listening to. The title track High Way to hell is just freaking awesome Angus Young really knows how to play those solos each song is filled with altleast one or two kik a** solos. Anyone who listens to good old rock n roll will love this ablum and some other great AC/DC albums High Voltage,Let there Be Rock,Dirty Deeds done Dirt Cheap,Powerage,Back in Black,'74 JailBreak,Back in Black and For Those about to Rock. I give this album 4 stars since all the songs are worth listening too and the great thing about having the digipak is you can get to read some tidbits about the bands history and some well written articles. Buy this album and you'll be totaly satisfied with the songs on this record.
B0000C1733|4.0|I don't know why everyone's complaining about this Greatest Hits compilation not having any material, other than Higher Ground, from the pre-BloodSugarSexMagik Chilis. Has anyone taken into account the fact that all of that material is still owned by EMI, the Chilis label from 1984 (Red Hot Chili Peppers) to 1989 (Mother's Milk)? I think that this is a pretty good history of the Chilis from BloodSugarSexMagik to the present, with the exception of a Rick Rubin-remixed &quot;Higher Ground&quot;. (Really, listen to it - it's not the same version that appeared on &quot;Mother's Milk&quot; or &quot;What Hits?!&quot;.) Granted, there is some stuff missing - for instance, I own the Greatest Hit and Videos version of this album, and I can't help but wondering why &quot;Aeroplane&quot; is on the Greatest Videos DVD, but not on the Greatest Hits album itself. All in all, this is a pretty solid Greatest Hits album. If you want any Chilis material from pre-1991, then check out thier &quot;What Hits ?!&quot; album, released under EMI records - THAT'S the album with classic songs such as &quot;True Men Don't Kill Coyotes&quot;, &quot;Backwoods&quot;, &quot;Johnny Kick a Hole in the Sky&quot;, and &quot;Behind the Sun&quot;.
B00006RAKP|4.0|Music: 4.5 Stars  Compilation: 3.5 Stars<br />There have been many Elton John collections over the years, even more so in Europe than here in the US. The release of &quot;Greatest Hits 1970-2002&quot; (34 tracks, 157 min.) is intended to be the truly definitive &quot;greatest hits&quot; collection. Did they get it right this time?<br />Given the time limitation of a CD, the compiler(s) had two choices: either to collect truly the greatest and biggest hits of Elton John (which would have inevitably skewed the compilation towards the earlier years), or present a &quot;balanced&quot; compilation that includes songs from all phases of Elton's career, regardless how big or small a hit they were. Unfortunately, the compiler(s) chose the latter route. As a result, a number of weaker songs from the later years were included, and thus a number of better known and bigger hits not being included. Just to name the biggest oversights: &quot;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds&quot; (a top 5 hit in 1974), &quot;Empty Garden (Hey Hey Johnny)&quot; (Elton's tribute to the slain John Lennon, a top 10 hit in 1981), &quot;Song for Guy&quot; (Elton's only instrumental hit ever, from 1978, a top 5 hit in most of Europe), &quot;Pinball Wizzard&quot; (1976 hit from the &quot;Tommy&quot; soundtrack), and even the novelty-hit &quot;Step Into Christmas&quot;. But the biggest blunder of them all is the inexusable absence of a little thing called &quot;Candle in the Wind 1997&quot;. Hello record company? It's only THE BIGGEST SELLING SINGLE OF ALL TIME, EVER, ANYWHERE!!!! Add those 6 songs instead of &quot;The One&quot;, &quot;Believe&quot;, &quot;Blessed&quot;, &quot;Something About the Way You Look Tonight&quot;, &quot;Written in the Stars&quot; and &quot;This Train Don't Stop There Anymore&quot;, and then you truly would have had something called Elton John's &quot;Greatest Hits 1970-2002&quot;.
B00000JGHM|5.0|Great flick.....perhaps the best car chase scenes and most &quot;tactically correct&quot; fire and maneuver sequences ever filmed. Outstanding plot and great acting.
B000002UZ1|5.0|Despite the number of releases in the late 90's with the Anthology series, the Beatles greatest songs have been compiled only one time in the last 30 years, in 2000's &quot;1&quot;. It's fun to go back to the companion 1973 releases &quot;1962-1966&quot; and this &quot;1967-1970&quot; (28 tracks, 99 min.), and marvel in particular at the latter's song selection and sequencing.<br />While now a bit awkwardly on 2 CDs, the original double vinyl was the perfect package. The song selection is just about perfect, really. Nothing to take away from &quot;1&quot;, but can you really call that the ultimate compilation of the Beatles when it doesn't have &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; (the definitive Beatles song?) or &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot;? Maybe it's too soon yet after &quot;1&quot;, but I really believe there is room for a 2 CD collection of the entire Beatles catalogue (greatest hits and essential album tracks) along the lines of &quot;The Definitive Bob Dylan&quot;, a great example of how to use the full capacity of CDs. Is anyone with me on that?
B000002OX7|5.0|Although Led Zeppelin IV was more popular (and maybe even more important) this album by Townshend, Daltrey, Entwistle, and Moon is unmatched in terms of overall performance and album making.  The songs build wonderfully from the incredible intro (Baba O'Riley, not Teenage Wasteland) to Bargain (religious overtones by Pete) to the resigning Love Ain't for Keeping.  And then the after Getting in Tune, Going Mobile, and Behind Blue Eyes, you have the antidote to Stairway to Heaven, Won't Get Fooled Again, which unfortunately is not true.  The Who as prophets were not as good as the Who as Rockers.
B00008H2LB|5.0|OK <BR>#1 this is a different type of music. ALL Metallica, Slipknot and those Heavy/Death/Bang your head like a reject music genres do NOT apply to Linkin Park. So therefore, someone who is involved with gothic death music, will give every single Linkin Park CD a bad review. This is a great band with a message and talent. Buy the cd, dont think more than twice. Honest review, no bull.
B000002J09|5.0|Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.  Without Led Zep IV, the history of rock music would have been completely different.  There are six songs that got regular radio play back in the 70's (and even on today's classic/hard rock playlists), and none of them were ever released as a single!  Till these guys showed up, that was unheard of.  They were the anti Beatles, who released all their hit songs as singles.  Zep did their own thing completely and incredibly well.  They never played their songs the same live (in contradiction to their live album, The Song Remains the Same!).  If you don't KNOW this album, you don't understand any music of the past 40 years.
B0000CAXID|4.0|While not as refined as subsequent efforts, the Foo Fighters' self-titled debut is a solid effort punctuated by the first three songs on the album.<br />The album breaks out of the gates with a lot of energy and gusto: \\"This is a Call\\" and \\"I'll Stick Around\\" are catchy tunes.<br />\\"Big Me\\" is a quick pit stop while on the pounding tracks freeway, but certainly still fits the album.<br />Starting with \\"Alone+Easy Target\\" the remaining songs are all good but less memorable and perhaps just a tiny bit rough around the edges.<br />The Foo Fighters are one of my favorite bands; this is probably my least favorite album by them, but only because the others are even better, not because this one is no good.  This album gets lots of praise (well deserved) and some detraction, too (mostly Nirvana copycat or Nirvana capitalizers stuff) -- I tend to think that each side has some valid points, in fact.  Whatever side you subscribe to, though, I think it'd be to your benefit to give both the band and their debut effort a try...I have little doubt that you'll be glad you did.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|OK, So They went a little softer on the music in some songs but the softer music adds a little break for the ears but listen to the lyrics and you still get the hate and sickness you learned to love or hate i shold say. and no all you people that say they slipknot has sold out or sound like stone sour . They have not sold out the have two multi-platnum albulms i dont think they need more money,and they sound nothing like stone sour. all arond a great rock cd. and a definate must buy<BR>                \,,/ ^.^ \,,/
B0001BKAEY|2.0|The distributors of this film highly overestimated the box office numbers and there is a good reason for that.  The team that put this movie together put a lot of work into the visual effects and it shows.  It is a visually stunning movie, but the effects just do not overcome the story's shortcomings.<BR>The dialogue and stilted delivery by the actors makes it seems like not much thought was put into it, particularly in the case of Carrie Anne Moss, out of whom we are entitled to expect more.  The same is true for Laurence Fishburne, another great actor thrown into a not-so-great screenplay.  Obviously we know better than to expect much from Keanu.  <BR>The story itself also took a turn for the worse.  I get a sense that the writers really ran out of ideas after the first film and began throwing new things at us.  I found the story very uninteresting as it evolved from Reloaded to Revolutions and at times even corny.<BR>The story's attempt to create philosophical undertones was actually offensive in that it often came off as condescending.  In the end, there is nothing profound in this movie save for the effort expended by the men and women in the effects department.<BR>I cannot in good conscience recommend it.
B000002HH2|5.0|Bjork is back with a new sound as always and making it sound even better than Debut did. Unlike Debut, which one a dance slash jazz album, Post is very techno and industrial.<br />1. Army of Me : A very strong opening and like Human Behaviour, gives no indication of the roller coaster ride that you are in store for. 9/10<br />2. Hyper-Ballad : When I first heard the first 20 seconds I absolutely hated it. But when I let my Bjork CD-R run through I wondered what the song was (considering the word Hyper-Ballad never comes up). I love it to death. 10/10<br />3. The Modern Things : This song is very very fun. I think it is going back the Debut album in parts (lyrics) but it loks better on Post and completes in story. 9/10<br />4. It's Oh So Quiet : It sort of scared me because when you ever see Bjork on VH1 they always show her screaming at the end and then her dancing around in Big Time Sensuality which just is not fair. **It's fun to choreograph to** 10/10<br />5. Enjoy : The first Bjork true masterpiece on Post in my opinion. She carries herself off so classy and fun that this song is always a surprise. Enjoy!!!!!! 20/10<br />6. You've Been Flirting Again : The intermission. I love this song because it sounds so soft and you can just imagine yourself on a mountain or in a garden. 10/10<br />7. Isobel : The sequel to Human Behaviour from Debut. This time the character (Isobel) tortures citizens of a city when she discovers the pebbles of her forest where actually tiny skysracpers. 10/10<br />8. Possibly Maybe : The equivilent to Enjoy in my opinon. 20/10<br />9. I Miss You : The last good track on the entire album. It is fun and very showtune. Put it this way....she actually makes the accordion sound cool Good use of music invention Bjork. 10/10<br />10. Cover Me : boring..2/10<br />11. My Headphones : i'm dead...0/10
B0000029GA|1.0|This album lacked good beats which is a pattern for Nas along with beat-stealing.  This guy, like Jay-Z make me sick.  They both steal from 2pac even though Pac clearly never liked either one of them.  Nas and Jay-Z sample far too many beats and lack creativity.  Neither one are worth a damn and bring down the value of the east coast rap scene.  That's why the westcoast is number 1, they can't hold a flame to Dre, Xzibit, Ice Cube, Too Short, or even Daz, Kurupt, Shaq, or Warren G.  I'm sure if I guy that didn't like me spit on the mic about my cred or lack thereof, I wouldn't steal his beats in order to get the spotlight.  Nas will never be as good as 2pac and more people need to realize that Nas is foul.  His bad songs definitely outweigh the good which in undisputable.  Ooooooooh, I'm a loser named Nas and I need to steal the beat from Cream's &quot;Sunshine Of Your Love&quot; in order to release my first single for my album.
B00000F566|5.0|Dirty Dancing is hands down the best movie of all time!  Enough said.
B00005JMUA|5.0|This movie is great, the first was great.  And I love that you don't need to see the first in order to enjoy the 2nd completely.  Good twists and turns.  And I can't believe RZA composed some of the 1st ones tuned.
B000002JST|5.0|This album another fav of mine. I bought it a week ago and listen to it at least once a week. All the songs have a big heavy guitar sound. The track Let there Be Rock is my fav on this particular album. I like every track on this album and give it five stars for the great guitar sound it has its unlike any other AC/DC album. I really wish they had mixed all the other albums this way but o well.
B00005JMYG|5.0|I may be partially biased (will ferrell is my favorite comedian)...but i have to say that this is by far the funniest movie i have ever seen...the humor is kind of out there at times so you have to be a certain type of person to enjoy it...but if you can accept the often \\"random humor\\" of will ferrell you will find this movie to be hilarious.
B00008BXJ6|4.0|This album is one of my favorite AC/DC albums. The remastered version sounds so much better than the original CD. The drums, guitars, bass and vocals sound so crisp. Once again all the songs on this album deserve  at least one listen to hear Bons great vocal range. Songs like Its a long way to the top,Rock N roll Singer,The Jack,Live Wire the hit single TNT, and High Voltage all gems. The funny thing is AC/DC never came to America to record an Album. Get this album. If your just getting into AC/DC get Let there Be rock. This album stands out from all the rest due to the more heavy guitar sound.
B00005JN2X|5.0|I know this movie will be awesome this is a Micheal Mann movie. Just look at the list of movies he's made Manhunter, Heat (one of my all time favorites), The Insider (another one of my all time favorites), and Ali. In all Micheal Mann's movies there are alway's awesome plot's, plot twists and performances. Ten years ago Tom Cruise was an awesome bad guy in Interview with the vampire, and again Tom Cruise will be awesome as a bad guy. I know Jamie Foxx who is always good, and Mark Ruffalo will put on good perfomances. So be ready for a night on the town.
B000268QB2|2.0|It is such an injustice to put a snippet of a Rolling Stone ragazine review comparing Keane to Radiohead.  How out of touch can Rolling Stone be?  Keane is a pleasant-sounding band, one which knows how to craft a lush pop song.  They are NOT a rock band.  Radiohead is a rock band. If comparisons are so important to people, try last decade's Air Supply if you want to know another band Keane may sound like.
B00024BHTC|5.0|Well, I just read a reveiw which pretty much says everything I want to say... but I'll say it again anyway. This is by far Nightwish's best album. If I could I'd give it 10 stars! They have come so far since there first album and they just keep getting better with every album. This kind of music is not for everyone, it is an aquired taste and you have to keep an open mind. Tarja's voice is so beautiful, I try to mimik her, but nobody will ever come close! Nightwish has been my favorite band for about 2 years and I own all there albums. Definatly check out their other albums if you like them. Oceanborn and Wishmaster are most commonly said to be the best albums. My favorite song on Once is Ghost Love Score, but all the songs are great. I would recommend this album to anyone with an open mind.
B0001GOH6Q|4.0|By far, one of the best movies that has come out in a while.  There wasn't a dry eye in the house the night I saw this. I rented it and watched it with some friends and the consensus was that it was even better the second time.
B00012QKSI|5.0|Great collection of music- found it even better than the movie (which wasn't that great despite the all star cast).  I think I would have enjoyed the movie more if I had listened to the soundtrack first- it really ties in with the plot.  Now that I've heard the soundtrack, I'm anxious to see the movie again.
B000268QB2|5.0|Couple of songs are visited by the ghost of Brian Wilson...scary and stunningly beautiful..(Everybody's Changing , Sunshine )<br />Saddest song ever written..(We Might As Well Be Strangers)<br />This album is a dream. Only first grade songs. A candy store. Step inside. Now.
B000002U8G|5.0|meddle was the fourth best floyd album in my opinion after the big triumvartate of the dark side of the moon,the wall and wish you were here mainly because of great songs like one of these days and the 23 minute opus echoes.very highly recommended.
1881273156|5.0|We see too many relationships fall apart when a failure to communicate leads to great misunderstanding, then to unyielding terminal unhappiness.  THE FIVE LOVE LANGUAGES is a thoughtful book, that can help you examine your own personal rhetoric of love (verbal and non-verbal), and that of your partner, then translate that understanding into more effective expression of the love you share. If your relationship is struggling with communication issues, even to the point of questioning the love itself, this book can help shed light for course correction. If you're in a strong and healthy relationship, the book can give personal insights for communicating your love, all the more.
B00028FDRA|5.0|The Best Gets Better!<br />First of all, I want to say that I already have the ordinary version of Comalies.  Great album!  Yesterday, while surfing Amazon.com, I found this special Limited Edition 2 Disc set.  And while I already have the first disc in its entirety, I was aching to hear the accoustic stuff, not to mention see the videos.  So I went out &amp; bought it :)<br />Now, I could be mistaken, but the copy I got is somewhat different from the one listed here on Amazon.com.  Nevertheless, I'll do a rundown of the copy I have, starting with the first disc (which you can find on its own as well).  Anyway, here goes.<br />DISC 1:<br />1) Swamped - Powerful song!  One of Lacuna Coil's heavier tracks but also one of their best.  Trust me, you'll love this one! :)<br />2) Heaven's A Lie - The first single from this album (I believe).  While I'm still trying to figure out the inner message here, I love this track.  Incredible melodies, great singing, great stuff all around.<br />3) Daylight Dancer - Gorgeous singing by Cristina.  As usual, outstanding melodies.  Great song all around.<br />4) Humane - Oh man, what an intro to this one!  Really builds up nicely.  Very atmospheric stuff.  Guitar work and singing are incredible as always.<br />5) Self Deception - Another great song with another great intro.  Awesome melodies, and Cristina's singing is truly incredible.<br />6) Aeon - When I first heard this song, I thought there was something wrong with my CD.  That's not the case though.  Has a long-ish intro, but one that's quite memorable.  Great guitar work, melodies, and Cristina's contribution is more than worth it.  Great track.<br />7) Tight Rope - This is one of the first songs I heard when I first got into Lacuna Coil.  The guitar work excels as always, and overall, this is a great song with great melodies.<br />8) The Ghost Woman and The Hunter - Wow, one of Lacuna Coil's best intros.  Very atmospheric.  Awesome melodies as well.  This is one of those songsyou just can't get out of your head, and to be honest, why would you even want to? :)<br />9) Unspoken - A somewhat heavier intro to this great song.  Cristina continues to shine in her melodious singing, and the rest of the band contributes to another incredible song.<br />10) Entwined - Another tremendous track.  Lacuna Coil can do no wrong in their songwriting and outstanding delivery.  Very emotional song (at least I think so).<br />11) The Prophet Said - Another heavy-ish track.  Guitar work rocks as always.  Great melodies, great singing, overall really good song.<br />12) Angel's Punishment - This was the song that introduced me to Lacuna Coil, and equally the one that got me hooked.  Incredible intro, much heavier track overall.  Cristina talks as well as sings, and to my knowledge, this is a rare case where Andi actually sings.  In my opinion, this is a great song to get you started on the band.<br />13) Comalies - Half in Italian, half in English, this track is still tremendous.  Powerful, very melodic, absolutely beautiful song.  A great way to bring this disc to an end!<br />&quot;Making of Comalies&quot; Enhanced Portion - Great video footage of the band goofing off, as well as in the recording process.  Really shows how cool they are.<br />DISC 2:<br />1) Heaven's A Lie (radio edit) - Shorter than the album version, but it's still Heaven's A Lie :)  Great stuff.<br />2) Swamped (radio edit) - Again altered some from the album version, but like I said before, it's great, heavy stuff.<br />3) Heaven's A Lie (accoustic) - Simply, wow!  Great accoustic guitar work.  And a perfect chance to hear Cristina sing a little softer.  Awesome stuff.<br />4) Swamped (accoustic) - Again, much softer singing.  This really puts an interesting twist on what was originally a much heavier album version.  Tremendous version.<br />5) Unspoken (accoustic) - One of my favorites on disc 2.  The accoustic work is fantastic!  Adds even more to the atmosphere of this incrediblesong.<br />6) Senzafine (accoustic) - Senzafine was a song written entirely in Italian that was from the band's sophemore album &quot;Unleashed Memories&quot;.  It's a great song to begin with (even though I don't understand a word of it).  But when you hear it played accousticly, wow!  Tremendous stuff.  Another priceless addition to disc 2.<br />7) Heaven's A Lie (live accoustic version) - Really much the same as the previous accoustic version on this disc, except for the addition of crowd applause at the end.  Not really needed when you have the previous accoustic version, but it's still cool to hear the crowd's reaction.  Plus, I think the whole thing is played just a little bit softer.<br />(8) Senzafine (live accoustic version) - Again much like the previous version.  Again I think it's played a little softer.  Not really needed, but considering this song is truly one of my favorites, it's still great stuff.<br />9) Aeon (live accoustic version) - I loved the album version, and this is a great accoustic version (plus the added crowd reaction at the end).  Truly awesome guitar work, singing, et al.<br />Swamped Video (Enhanced) - Wow!  Awesome video!  Somewhat dark, very atmospheric.  Worth having the second disc all by itself!<br />Heaven's A Lie (Enhanced) - Another very interesting video.  Again worth getting the second disc on its own.  You gotta' see this stuff.  And wow is Cristina hot! :)<br />Overall, this 2 disc set is worth MORE than the 5 stars I've allocated.  If you're a Lacuna Coil fan, and even if you have the regular version of Comalies, you'll want to get this version as well.  If you're new to the band, this is a great introduction to their awesome style!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B0001UL7RY|1.0|look, i dont mean to be one of those people that just rambles on about how bad something is, but im going to say what this album really is- crap. and i dont care if you like her because you think she is punk(which she isnt) or you just like the songs, but this album is terrible. she thinks she is punk because she is punk, but punk is about real things- not about how your grandfather died. THE WORST ALBUM OF THE YEAR!!!!

SO MUCH! you dont \\"really\\" need any introduction to friends to watch this! (except it would be good to watch the first series first, but this is not necessary.) Also the special features are good, not brillient, but pleasing. My favourite being the FULL Smelly Cat Video after the quiz! its soooo halarious! This dvd version of Friends Season 2 has never before seen footage so, even if you have seen the eps. its worth getting!<BR>If you havent seen them its a gret intro. so my conclusion get it NOW! <BR>Episodes *****<BR>Special Features ****1/2
B0002I831S|1.0|but knowing Paramount, they could of sat on the release the boxed sets for who knows how long.  It could have been atleast until 2006 (40th Anniversary) until they decided to release them as boxed sets since they could have easily continued to gouge buyers into buying the 2 episode per disc set -- why shouldn't they?  they control the market?...and they probably will still do it.  After everyone has bought the boxed sets they will release them all again remastered in High Definition. Maybe, with the infamous blooper reel as a bonus (unless they oh, so generously decide to release it in the upcoming season 2 and 3 boxed sets -- but I doubt it. Frankly, life's too short and I didn't want to wait for the boxed sets.  I've enjoyed them since their release 5 years ago.<br />In any case, I won't be re-buying the new sets.  The \\"bonuses\\" seem a little thin and desparate....probably will be some interviews of some of the supporting staff that were loosely involved (many of the important guys have passed on any way)in the original series making some minor comment on obscure incidents playing on the nostalgiac thirst of the hard-core fan.<br />In fact I can see Paramount re-re-releasing the series again (the 40th anniversary set?) with FULL LENGTH commentaries for every episode (e.g. Sally Kellerman, Willim Koenig, Dianne Muldar, William Ware Theiss etc.) by some of the actors actors and guests stars -- ONLY after everyone has bought the boxed sets.<br />However had Paramount been more fair about how they released the DVD's,and the way they treat loyal fans, I probably would have, for the sake of \\"completeness\\" continued to support their products (TNG, DS9, Voyager, and likely Enterprise etc.) but I'm not -- mainly because they don't deserve my business and they won't.  In fact I generally BOYCOTT Paramount DVDs.<br />As Scotty once said: \\"Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame me\\"...and I'm not about to be fooled again.<br />See you later paramount suckers!
0380807343|4.0|Coraline Jones is a little girl (precise age unknown) who has recently moved into a big old house with her parents.  It is the summer break from school and Coraline is bored.  To pass the time she likes to explore the big house and its surroundings.  One afternoon, she finds a door that leads into a black corridor.  This black corridor in turn leads into a house that is practically a mirror image of her own, with the same rooms and the same inhabitants, including her parents.  But within these there are fundamental changes; the rooms contain weird variations of her toys, the house and the yard are filled with talking animals and her parents are very different here too.  They look like her parents but certainly don't act like her parents.  Soon, Coraline and her real parents are trapped into this mirror version of their house and it is up to her to get them out safely...<br />This is a challenging book to categorize.  It is actually marketed as a book for children and adults 8 years and up.  The writing is indeed geared towards a younger age bracket, the prose simplistic, the sentences short-clipped.  Not only is the novel only 160 pages long, but it's large print as well.  I personally breezed through this book in less than 2 hours.  However, one has to wonder whether this book might be a little too dark for young kids to enjoy.  Gaiman raises some deep chills here and goes for the grotesque on occasion with several scenes involving insects.  Usually I find the term \\"Dark Fantasy\\" to be a cop-out used by authors who would rather not be referred to as horror writers so as not to be pigeonholed into a genre that has its ups and downs (Dean Koontz anyone?) but with Gaiman the term actually seems to fit like a glove.  There's something very magical about his writing that makes us feel a part of the world he is crafting despite the fantastical premise.<br />I loved how Gaiman used the short length of his story to his advantage.  The story wastes little time getting started as Coraline actually stumbles upon the magical door at around page#25.  Lots of things happen in the novel especially once the \\"challenge\\" is set forth between Coraline and her other evil mother, the pace picks up and the pages become filled with action and adventure.  And the ending feels appropriate and satisfying too.  The only thing I wish would have been included is some explanation, no matter how small, of how this alternate dimension came to be.  But then again part of the appeal of Gaiman's work has always been about the mystique and unexplained weirdness of his tales.  \\"Coraline\\" is a treasure of a story, wrapped in a small package that won't require more than two hours of a reader's time and yet will leave a lasting impression.ed as Coraline actually stumbles upon the magical door at around page#25.

B0001MDP3G|5.0|There is probably a more closely related story in anceint Greek liturature to compare this to but I'll stick with Ulysses as being close enough (the well business in the DVD really ties it in to the old stories).<br />The producers did a nice job of depicting the starved, sick (tuberculosis), poorly clothed people of the war torn south except for their bright Hollywood dental work.  The period music is a lot of fun too (and I'm uncomfortable with the realization that most of it is somewhere in my CD collection in more modern versions).<br />Having read &quot;Rebel Private: Front and Rear : Memoirs of a Confederate Soldier&quot; by William A. Fletcher, Richard Wheeler also did a lot to help this movie come alive.  In fact I was surprised not to see a reference to the book in the closing credits of the DVD, but I didn't get to the second disc yet.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|Simply the best CD for anyone loving Queen, Radiohead, and anyone following along that line.  It has Queen's awsome rock out music but, the vocals are very similar to radiohead.  A beautiful combination!
B000003TA4|1.0|The first wave of Grunge rock (which dominated the music scene until 1994) emerged when record companies, distraught at the rapid decline of '80s hair bands, decided to co-opt the old concept of punk rock and cash in on the vague frustration experienced by every youthful generation. Bands like Nirvama capitalized off Generation X's antipathy and served basically as a puppet for their own record company, while at the same time, selling out the indie credibilty to a mainstream faction of corporationalism. Talent was easy to come by because of this putrid movement's aesthetic of ambiguously angry lyrics masked by turgidly repetitive guitar riffs distorted to hide their musical deficiencies. Every one of these groups was nearly interchangeable, as Pearl Jam sounded just like Stone Temple Pilots sounded just like fill-in-the-blank. <br />Hell, they even sang alike and all dressed in nicely coordinated flannel shirts and muddy-brown corduroy pants from the Gap (these being those distant times before our nation's insatiable appetite for cargo pants was discovered). Every summer or so the grunginess would congregate at the Lollapalooza festival, an event which the San Francisco Chronicle later described as \\"a generation becoming a caricature of itself.\\"<br />The increasingly fickle public couldn't be held rapt with a genre as quintessentially boring as grunge for long, and so the music industry flung at them an increasing array of splinter-marketed groups, some of which stuck, but most didn't. Rap and the whole hip-hop lifestyle truly came into its own, despite a penchant for firearms and sampling `80s classic rock songs. The genre's success was probably due in no small part to the truly moribund nature of rock n' roll.
6304712499|1.0|Dreary and forgettable &quot;super(anti-)hero&quot; flick based upon Todd McFarland's comicbook character. SPAWN is an interesting antihero, but ultimately the background and origin of the character which manifests repeatedly during the film depresses the movie. He is a hell-spawned creature given a chance to live outside of damnation by becoming an agent of hell and walk among the living. This is heavy-handed and boggs down the the story and Spawn himself.  If Batman's origin which also manifests throughout the course of the history of the character (his parents get murdered in front of him) is a downer, Spawn's is just too much depressing. The visual special effects that depict the hellish atmosphere are graphic and detailed.  However, who wants to be reminded of going to hell every second of the movie. Then there is John Leguizamo as &quot;Clown&quot; playing one of the most annoying characters in recent cinema history (up there with Jar Jar Binks). Finally, Spawn pining over losing his wife and seeing her married to, and having a child with another man (his best friend of all people)is another depressing aspect of the movie.  Only thing noteworthy is seeing a rare film appearance by actor Nicol Williamson (EXCALIBUR)as Cogliostro, Spawn's mentor. Overall,a Grade B flick that has no universal appeal whatsoever.  SPAWN's main theme is death and hell (not necessarily in that order), with a depressing title character, a depressing origin,depressing plot and story, depressing looking visuals of the afterlife, and one annoying Clown (Leguizamo).

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I started watching this show when it came out on Fox a couple of years ago, and loved it.  The characters and stories were all well thought out.  Being a space western, the feel of the show was unique and the special effects were better than anything seen on TV. However, something always seemed a little weird, like the episodes were out of order.  As it turns out, my gut feelings were right.  What can only be called horribly management and scheduling by Fox, episodes were played out of order.  The 2 hour series premiere was not shown first.  Instead another episode started the series on TV, jumping right into the middle of a plot line and characters that the audience didn't know.  Eleven episodes later Fox had done such a poor job promoting this critically acclaimed show that it was cancelled with another 3 episodes left unaired.  These episodes are included, fully produced, on the DVD set.<br />So many Firefly DVD sets have now been sold that Universal Studios has series creator Joss Whedon (Buffy and Angel fame) already filming a Firefly big screen movie called &quot;Serenity&quot; (serenitymovie.com).  I would encourage anyone to by the series.  You will be left wanting more, which will be coming next spring!
0060977493|1.0|Please, intelligent readers, do not naively accept the gushing recommendations to read this book. I found it to be an odd amalgam of literary techniques seemingly borrowed from other writers. For example, the shifting chronology and stream-of-conscious evoked William Faulkner's The Sound and the Fury, in that the reader learns the entire plot in the first chapter. However, unlike Faulkner, Roy leaves no mystery for the reader to solve; it is entirely predictable. Roy's hint of magical realism is interesting, but, as other reviewers have mentioned, seems to borrow from Gabriel Garcia Marquez. At first, the children's perspective of a terrible crime based on prejudice in a cruel, adult world seemed original... until I realized that Harper Lee used this same perspective in To Kill a Mockingbird. The only reason I would suggest reading TGOST is if you enjoy challenging other people's gushing affirmations of a book's popularity. Which-come to think of it-I do enjoy.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|If you are a fan of the Alien saga, or a buyer of blockbuster movies, you must have this collection. Not only are the extras (see the Amazon review by Dalkin for all the technical details  including; documentaries, commentaries, storyboards, illustrations and post-production notes) what you would expect from any serious DVD package these days, you also get two versions of each movie. <br />It is an interesting exercise to compare the different versions of each film. Alien Resurrection isn't altered much, and the director's cut of Alien is inferior to the theatrical version. Cameron's director's cut of Aliens enhances the original while a special edition version of Alien 3 (not endorsed by Fincher) is worth having, despite some flaws with sound and overall quality.<br />Some reviews have criticised the packaging and quality of the DVD's. My DVD's were in perfect condition with no scatches or glitches while playing. These complaints may be related to a certain batch, and couldn't possibly be typical of the product. <br />While the packaging isn't brilliant, these criticisms should not disuade any prospective buyer. If you take care it should last. But really, who buys a DVD package for the cardboard? <br />As I wrote above, if you are a fan of the series you must have this product. I also recommend collectors of box sets to invest in this superior product. I doubt the Alien saga box set can or will be improved upon in the future. This is the ultimate edition, despite a slightly cheap package.
B00024BHTC|5.0|There are not many hard rock bands that I go completely ape over.  I am more of a goth/industrial/EBM fan. Most hard rock bands today are rather dull and uninspiring. The few I do like includes Lacuna Coil and Evanescence but my favorite hard rock band is Nightwish. I have been a fan of Nightwish for a few short years now. &quot;Wishmaster&quot; was my first album I bought and it completely blew me away, especially lead singer Tarja's vocals. &quot;Oceanborn&quot; is my very favorite album by the Finnish band. Although flawed, &quot;Century Child&quot; was...no, is a good rock album. I don't get why people slag on it so much (let alone this band). It may not have been perfect but it was good I think. Unable to wait until the band's August concert in my city, I finally got my hands on the new album &quot;Once&quot; today. It finally came. I was completely blown away by the sheer aggressiveness of the album. &quot;Once&quot; is definitely the most aggressive album the band has put out. Guitarist Emppu Vuorinen really turns up the volume on the album with his ferocious guitar riffs, especially with the first two tracks &quot;Dark Chest of Wonders&quot; and &quot;Wish I had an Angel&quot;. Tarja's operatic vocals sounds amazingly cleaner on this album than on past albums. I am able to actually hear what she is singing in the songs. Bassist Marco Hietala's gruff vocals compliments Tarja's clean vocals on a occasion throughout the album. It is difficult for me to pick out my favorite songs on the album. All the songs are good in their own right. The last two songs on the cd &quot;Kuolema Tekee Taiteilijan&quot; and &quot;Higher Than Hope&quot; are two of the most beautiful ballads the band has ever done. I also adore &quot;Ghost Love Score&quot;. The melodies is nothing short of breathtaking as is Tarja's singing. I loved how the band took a chance by using a choir on the album as well as Native American influences on &quot;Creek Mary's Blood&quot;. &quot;Once&quot; definitely does not sound like any of the band's previous albums. The production on &quot;Once&quot; is much improvement from previous albums. It is has a big, in your face sound. In the past, the band's other albums were a bit too clean on the production but here it is in your face and less polished. Was it worth shelling out almost $30 for this album? Heck yes! I love this band. I can't wait to see them next month.itely does not sound like any of the band's previous albums. The production on &quot;Once&quot; is much improvement from previous albums.

Don't mess with a classic film my friend, No matter how much money you have you'll always be remembered as a money grubbing sellout. Computer animations are great arn't they!

B0001Z52RU|4.0|The basic idea of &quot;The Butterfly Effect&quot; appeals to me.  I remember the Ray Bradbury short story where the guy goes back in time to shoot a T-Rex and changes the future because he comes back with a butterfly on his boot and enjoyed watching Sam trying to set the past to rights on &quot;Quantum Leap.&quot;  But the story from co-writers and co-directors Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber also resonates with me because of an idea I had for short story about a rich guy who wants the Confederacy to win the Civil War.  He sits in the time machine trying to select the right moment to go back and change history; he only has one shot and he sits there, going over all the options (e.g., assassinate Lincoln years earlier, help Pickett's charge succeed), unable to decide which would guarantee success.<br />However, in &quot;The Butterfly Effect&quot; it turns out that Evan (Ashton Kutcher) has multiple opportunities for changing his past, although actally it is the past of Kayleigh Miller (Amy Smart) that he wants to change.  But his also means changing the past of Kayleigh's brother, Tommy (William Lee Scott) and their friend, Lenny (Elden Henson), as well as Evan's mother (Melora Walters) and his college roommate (Ethan Suplee).  The problem is that every time he changes the past things do not necessarily get better as new problems are presented.  But Evan keeps trying to find the magic solution that will set everything to rights, or at least what he thinks would be the best of all possible worlds.<br />Evan and his friends had a trouble childhood.  &quot;The Butterfly Effect&quot; takes place mainly in the present, but it also involves going back to when the kids were 7 and discovered that Mr. Miller (Eric Stolz) was a sicko and when they were 13 and something equally horrible happened.  The first time we visit these events we do not know everything that happened because Evan does not remember; as a child he was afflicted with blackouts and since the film is told from his perspective we follow suit.  Evan's mother is worried that he might have the same mental illness as his father, but Dr. Redfield (Nathaniel DeVaux) does not think so and has Evan start keeping a journal.<br />In college Evan discovers that when he reads the journal entries he wrote in the past he can go back to that moment in time and that he can control what he says and does, thereby changing the present.  This is certainly an interesting way of engaging in time travel (cf. Christopher Reeves thinks his way to the past in &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot;) and I think &quot;The Butterfly Effect&quot; is a rather ambitious time travel film that is trying to be intelligent in terms of both the theory at work and the construction of the story.  This is one of those films where you can better appreciate it the second time around, even if you do all the Infinifilm options, especially once you understand the rules for the game.<br />In the end I am not sure if it is because the intelligence of the story by Bress and Gruber is not up to their ambition, but you cannot fault the effort.  One of the strengths of this film is how it takes it time, as Evan wrestles with not only the changes in his world but struggles to figure out what he can do to make everything better the next time around.  This is certainly superior to their previous effort, &quot;Final Destination 2&quot; and it will be interesting to see what they come up with next if they continue along this path.  As for performances I would say that Amy Smart's is the best of the bunch and as for Ashton Kutcher, I know he is usually regarded as a tabloid joke or a television pretty boy, but this was actually the first film I have seen when I liked his character or his performance.  He might be a forgotten actor by the end of the decade, but he gets props for showing some ambition.  But in the final analysis this is Bress and Gruber's film and everybody is just along for the ride.<br />I watched the director's cut (or, I guess, the directors' cut) before seeing the original theatrical ending or the two alternative endings (&quot;Stalker&quot; and &quot;Happy Sappy&quot;) and at this point would have to say the first one I saw is the best of the bunch.  That is because while the effect remains the same the cause in the original theatrical release is just too simplistic after the complicated setup.  Granted, the preferred version is rather dark and twisted, but if you listen to any of the commentary on the DVD you will understand their reasoning.t (or, I guess, the directors' cut) before seeing the original theatrical ending or the two alternative endings (&quot;Stalker&quot; and &quot;Happy Sappy&quot;) and at this point would have to say the first one I saw is the best of the bunch.

0060278250|4.0|On the whole, I really enjoyed the Abhorsen Trilogy, but I don't feel like it was written to fit into three books.  There are still too many loose ends to make the books a coherent set that begins and ends.  At the end of this third book, I turned the last page and wondered why there weren't more volumes. For example, there was absolutely no reason for Mogget to slip and almost say that Chlorr was a former Abhorsen ... but only if the trilogy really is a trilogy, with no more volumes.  It didn't do anything for the plot: we never saw Chlorr again, and we already knew that Mogget likes dropping hints of his fundamental superiority and his impressive wealth of knowledge.  Why include that bit of information if isn't designed to go anywhere?<br />Again, on the whole, I loved the books--I read the last two in a day and a half, not really wanting them to end.  That said, I keep hoping that more books will be added to this finely constructed series.
B000002J03|2.0|I used to love LZ, but they've soured on me as well because of all the law suites over old blues songs. And that they were pretty much a studio band posing as something they were not. Man, was I disappointed. LZ really weren't that original after all.<br />SCORESHEET:<br />WHOLE LOTTA LOVE- good impact, but a Willie Dixon and Muddy Waters rip-off<br />and that ugly jam section in the middle. Dixon took them to court in 1977.<br />WHAT IS AND WHAT SHOULD NEVER BE- one of their better songs.<br />THE LEMON SONG- another rip-off (a remake of killing floor) and it is boring.<br />THANK YOU- a nice ballad, but nothing that you really need to own.<br />HEARTBREAKER- an FM staple, a classic! It is the `wallpaper of our lives'.<br />LIVIN LOVIN MAID- LZ putting down woman again. Good riff, but a bad message!<br />RAMBLE ON- a good song that is simply overplayed. Vocalist Plant is no Ian Gillan!<br />MOBY DICK- a great riff, but that drum soloooooooooooooboring.<br />BRING IT ON HOME- starts off good, but gets repetitive by the end. Another rip-off too!<br />Look for their greatest hits collections before buying their regular albums.<br />If your looking for even more hard rock that swings, try Deep Purple 1970/1973 (In Rock, Fireball, Machine Head, Who Do We Think We Are or Made In Japan).
1400032717|4.0|This novel, written by Mark Haddon through another persons eyes, can be engrossing to people who enjoy amusing lore. Mystery and murder fans will not be as intrigued if they are looking for a heavy murder novel. This book chronicles the false accusation of Christopher Boone, who found a neighbors pet brutally mangled in the backyard. Haddon explains Boone's ability to decipher prime numbers up to 7500 or more. However, the book does NOT have much to do with animals at all. The entire story focuses on our protagonist, Boone. Though he attempts to solve the mystery of the killing, 50% of the book explains his life and how he lives it. Can be quite interesting and a quick read to particular people. For those who expect a horror/mystery novel, they should read Michael Crichton instead of this. <BR>     Though the hardback edition is more durable than the Vintage paperback, it is MUCH more expensive in some cases. If you are leaving on a long vacation and plan to carry the book with you, buy the hardback, but if you just read it quickly at home, the paperback &quot;Vintage Contemporaries&quot; will serve you fine.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is THE most underrated television series of all-time.  During a time when reality TV is slowly but surely destroying the minds of America, along came a series that was intelligent yet entertaining at the same time.  Have you ever thought television executives were just throwing darts against a wall choosing which television series to cancel and renew?  Well, not far from the truth.  Firefly being pulled from the airways by one of the networks was the single worst crime committed by Hollywood against the American public.<br />I wholeheartedly endorse purchasing this complete series and tuning in for yourself.  It is one of the greatest television programs ever created.  The writing is brilliant, and the acting of the series stars is top-notch.  It is a fantastic example of seeing how an entire production crew (from the producer, director, actors, etc.) all LOVE and truly BELIEVE in what they are doing.<br />Buy it.  Buy it today.  Buy it for your friends, family, and neighbors.  You will NOT be sorry you did.

The author's perspective is unique and while the subject is death, the book is upbeat and enchanting.  <br />Sebold has an uncanny ability to jump from gender to gender, age to age, and paint a picture of incredible detail that makes the reader believe the herone, 14-year-old deceased Susie Salmon, is indeed looking down from her prison/heaven and experiencing the pain, joy, and emotions each of her loved ones have endured since her murder.<br />The description of homicide detective Len Fenerman's feelings about &quot;wounded women&quot; on Page 272 is both compact and compassionate.  &quot;The wife in the bait-'n'-tackle shop had no bruises on her fact but cowered like a dog and spoke in apologetic whispers.&quot;  <br />It is that kind of tightness of thought that could place Sebold in the same category as John Steinbeck and Pearl Buck as she continues to hone her craft.

I was in the back talking to the guy that opened before him and just hanging out. He started singing and jamming and I just got liked a magnetic force to the stage! He blew me away! His voice is amazing and he is very talented!
B0001HAHXW|1.0|I like both EC and Robert Johnson, but this collection just does not work.  Many years ago EC did a great job interpreting Crossroads in a modern rock/blues cover, but these new arrangements are light-hearted versions of some very heavy, soulful songs.  I'm sure Mr. Clapton could have done a better job.  Save your money and get the original recordings.
078322804X|5.0|Unique, wonderful, hilarious.  <br />\\"The Blues Brothers\\" holds up even better than one might have hoped.  And that's a beautiful thing for one of the most unique movies ever made.  Conceived, as Belushi once put it, as a show case for African-American music, the movie is exactly that and so much more.<br />I was moved to watch the \\"Shake Your Tail Feather\\" scene due to Ray Charles' recent death.  The performance is so wonderful, so full of life; we have lost a true national treasure.  But his amazing performance for the movie will live on forever.  The soundtrack's 5.1 remix (including the reintegration of old footage cut from a preview at the Picwood Theater in LA.  According to Landis, in the DVD's liner notes, the movie distributors complained no white people would see the movie!) is simply amazing.  Even on my bargain set, it is crisp, pure and clean and is probably my candidate for best sound DVD ever.  Landis again demonstrates his technical mastery, understanding of technology and choice of brilliant helpmates.<br />As the same Landis once put it, \\"Where else can a white kid see Cab Calloway, John Lee Hooker and James Brown in the same two hours?\\"  He left out Ray Charles and Aretha Franklin as well as studio legends Steve \\"The Colonel\\" Cropper (who almost single-handed reintroduced cocaine to Hollywood, the number of people who began their addictions under his tutelage is frightening but no names here; you'll have to look it up yourself); and bass legend \\"Duck\\" Dunn, one of the greatest bassists of all times (sorry, Duck, my man, even you have to bow, with every other bassist, to Geddy Lee).  Normally invisible, we get to see and here the Blues Brothers' amazing band.  These studio legends get there fifteen minutes, often to hilarious effect.  Willie \\"Too-Bit\\" Hall, the drummer even shows really comic talent, as does Dunn and \\"Mr. Fabulous,\\" the horn man.<br />The movie also preserves the now destroyed Maxwell Street, one of the great centers of African-American music and R&B and one of the seedbeds of rock n roll.  This is the only place anyone can see Maxwell Street in its prime.  In a sense the movie is also a historical document, preserving those people and places who have left us.<br />The plot is almost irrelevant, beside the almost hysterical comedy and stunning musical performances (Calloway and Franklin never did BETTER jobs on their two signature classics), but there is a story there.  The cameos are hilarious as well, from Carrie Fischer (who has said she quit coke because Belushi, on set, one day pointed at her and said, \\"You're becoming just like me.\\"  On that note, Robin Williams also says his visit to Belushi on his ultimate night helped him give up the Life that took his friend) and the Keystone Nazis the Boys have to avoid in their quest to save their childhood home, a dilapidate orphanage on Chicago's South side.  The \\"Flight of the Pinto\\" scene is not to be missed.  And be sure to listen for the tell-tale mating call of a most un-endangered species, \\"hut-hut-hut.\\"<BR>A movie for the ages.  It also highlights the bitter tragedy of Belushi's self-destruction.  One can only imagine what a sobered and cleaned-up Belushi could do when he did this movie whilst doing 4 grams of coke a day, dropping acid, downers, booze, marijuana (all of this is in Boobward's sensationalist \\"biography\\" of Belushi called \\"Wired\\").  Unlike other famous drug addicts and alcoholic (Monroe, Presley, Dean) Belushi's fortunately has been taken as a warning sign of Hollywood excess and hasn't lead to his apotheosis.<br />Despite his tragic end, the movie is one of the few that, no matter my troubles I can put this movie in the DVD player and know I will be smiling in mere minutes.  As I smile now, writing this.<br />Every American teenager should see this simply for the musical numbers alone.  The word classic is misused as often as the word \\"hero\\" these days, but it's not misused here.  What could have been the umpteenth bad iteration of \\"Animal House\\" instead attained the temporary immortality of the true classic.  Belushi's been gone for more than twenty years now, but the brilliant John, the hilarious John, the gifted performer John Belushi will live on forever.  <br />And, wherever you are John that has to make you smile.
B0001MDP3G|5.0|I have to admit, I had no desire to see this movie but I did because my best friend wanted to see it. THANK GOD I Did !! OMG, What an AWESOME Movie. It has something for everyone. I shed a few tears also. The story of Inman and Ada is SO compelling. I am proud to say that I OWN this movie now !!
0064471837|5.0|As one editorial said \\"Just TRY to put this book down!\\" And I challenge you, dear reader, as well! I stayed up late into the night and sat around during the day reading this book! I even tried to put it away for a while to read another book so that Sabriel would last longer. I found this absolutely impossible! I always found myself wandering back for more.<br />To get to the plot, the prologue starts everything out. A child has just been born in a traveling caravan and both the mother and baby have died. Just before the child is committed to Death, a strange man steps from the woods, a necromancer. But this one is special, his name is Abhorsen and unlike other necromancers who raise the Dead for evil deeds, this man puts the Dead to rights. He enters the gray river of Death and brings the child back to life, soon proclaiming that she is in fact his daughter and will be called Sabriel.<br />Chapter one begins with Sabriel at the age of 18 about to leave boarding school in the land of Ancelstierre. On this particular night, she is waiting for a visit from her father. When his spirit doesn't appear as scheduled, she is summoned into Death to receive his 7 necromancy bells used for banishing the Dead. From that point, Sabriel knows that her father is either trapped in Death or possibly has been killed. She must now enter what is called The Old Kingdom, crossing the guarded barrier wall in the process, to embark on the quest to find her father and help guard against Dead trying to break back into life!<br />Sabriel comes across broken Charter Stones, protective pillars which can only be broken by the sacrifice of a powerful Charter Mage where they then become gateways to and from Death. She fights the Dead who are looking for people to drain the life from to prolong their stay in Life. Her journey takes her to her father's house which rests on a cliff in the middle of a waterfall, she picks up a cat which is not a cat (longtime servant of her family) and a person-turned-wooden figurehead as companions. She is chased by Dead and horrible creatures of mud and fire and along the way must enter Death, walk past several of it's nine Gates, use magical Charter Spells and symbols and come to grips with an Evil Greater Dead Spirit which has plagued the crumbling Old Kingdom for 200 years!<br />This is such a great book! It's so NEW and interesting! I've never read anything like this, Sabriel is definitely NOT a copy of another novel! I love books with a heroine, like \\"The Blue Sword\\" or \\"The Golden Compass\\". In a way, it reminds me of Lyra's world with the strange magic and symbols, just like the aleithiometer. Or in the case of Damar, in the Old Kingdom sometimes guns and artillery fail and electricity just won't function. Also, military forces guard the borders between the normal and mysterious lands. But that is where the similarity ends. And, if those similarities hadn't been there, I don't think I would have liked the book as well! I love that I can relate Sabriel to other books that I have loved over the years!<br />I'm working on reading Lirael now and in four days I have read 400 pages! Oh, and for those of you who have started to read and are disappointed you haven't seen anything of Sabriel yet, just wait! She does come back into the plot! Keep reading!<br />These books, despite their length and complexities, are actually easy reads simply for the fact that they are GOOD!!! I've added them to my collection of Fantasy favorites along with C.S. Lewis' \\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\", J.R.R. Tolkien's \\"The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings Trilogy\\", Robin McKinley's \\"The Blue Sword\\" \\"Spindle's End\\" and \\"The Hero and the Crown\\", Phillip Pullman's \\"His Dark Materials Trilogy\\" and Madeline L'Engle's Time Quartet: \\"A Wrinkle in Time\\" \\"A Wind in the Door\\" \\"A Swiftly Tilting Planet\\" and \\"Maney Waters\\".<br />Nix is definitely one of THOSE writers, you know what I mean, he writes the kind of books you want to read slowly because you want to savorthem for as long as possible but at the same time you find yourself RUSHING ahead to the next passage because you HAVE to know what happens! His books are simply too hard to put down! I look forward to reading more and to seeing more of his work published. Read The Abhorsen Trilogy, you will NOT be let down!them for as long as possible but at the same time you find yourself RUSHING ahead to the next passage because you HAVE to know what happens! His books are simply too hard to put down! I look forward to reading more and to seeing more of his work published. Read The Abhorsen Trilogy, you will NOT be let down!
B0000524E5|5.0|At first I thought this movie was for the men, not so, this is a definite chic flick (Although the men will enjoy it too, for obvious reasons). I really enjoyed the story line. This is one of those movies that I will gladly watch over and over.
B0001VWP8I|5.0|Madonna had Ray Of Light.  Mariah had Butterfly.  Janet had Velvet Rope.  Now it is Anastacia's turn to show the world how much she has grown as a person and artist through all the hardships that she has been through.  When I first listened to the album, I was in complete shock by the talent that this incredible woman portrayed.  She has grown emensely as a writer and singer since Freak Of Nature.  The best track of the album is Heavy On My Heart.  Other fantastic songs are Left Outside Alone, Welcome To My Truth, Seasons Change, and Where Do I Belong.  I also love the rest of the songs - except Sexy Single.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|Thiis album is very borng.  The album will make you fall a sleep, better yet it was make the baby fall a sleep too.
B0000028RR|5.0|I first got into Rage Against The Machine in 7th grade, when I was into crap like Limp Bizkit and purchased Evil Empire because people said I would like it if I liked Limp Bizkit. In retrospect, that comparison is a big insult to Rage. That's like comparing \\"Goodfellas\\" to \\"You Got Served\\".<br />Anyway, I really liked (and still like) Evil Empire (especially \\"Vietnow\\"). However, I didn't get this album until this past January. Before then, I had a few of the songs on mixes, but that's it. I listened to samples in the store and really liked what I heard, so I purchased it. Forget Wimp Bizkit; this is rock-rap done RIGHT!<br />First of all, the musicians here; Tom Morello, Tim Commerford and Brad Wilk (now of Audioslave); are all very talented. Check out the slap bass, the riffs, the drumming. Add Zack De La Rocha's politically-charged rhymes over top of them, and you get what might be the only band in history influenced by both Led Zeppelin and Public Enemy, which may sound like mixing pizza and ice cream but comes out sounding damn good. Most of the songs on here are favorites.<br />The angry, anti-authority/government diatribes are what made this album a classic twelve years ago. Before 1992, there weren't too many albums with \\"[...] you, I won't do what you tell me!\\" as a lyric. And I think \\"When ignorance reigns, life is lost\\" is very relatable to the Iraq war going on today.<br />Overall, if you want a REAL rap-rock record, check this one out first, then get the others.(...)
B00004YKUY|5.0|This is a great album, hands down. This might be the only album that I can sit down and listen through the whole thing without skipping a song.<br />When I heard Perry was replaced with some no name singer by the name of Steve Augeri, I was shocked. But one day I stumbled about the internet and found journeyconinues.com. I decided to give them a shot and checked out the live video of &quot;Higher Place&quot;. I was blown away and went out the next day and bought the DVD, Arrival, and Red 13. It took a while to make my Dad accept that Perry was gone and I finally got him to listen to all the new Journey material. He loved it. In fact, I just made my Dad buy tickets to one of their live shows this month.<br />My favorites I would have to say are &quot;Higher Place&quot;, &quot;Signs of Life&quot;, &quot;World Gone Wild&quot;, &quot;Nothin' Comes Close&quot;, and &quot;To Be Alive Again&quot;. Also the openning drum solo on &quot;We Will Meet Again&quot; is awesome and Steve's vocals on &quot;Kiss Me Softly&quot; are amazing.<br />So, I ask you. What are you waiting for? Buy this CD, Red 13, and the live DVD right now. And if you still have some money left check out journeymusic.com and see if they're playing anywhere near you so you can buy some tickets to one of their shows.
B00005JMUA|5.0|I like this movie despite it not being a gory as the fisrt one. This one was gentler but it did not lose anything in my opinion. Two thumbs up way up.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|I ignored this movie during its run in theaters because the critics really bashed it hard. I will never listen to those losers again. I finally gave in to all the people I know telling me just how great this movie was and I rented it today. I will be buying this movie first thing tomorrow, that's how great it is. I am not a fan of Ashton Kutcher at all, but he actually played the low-key part rather well. He wasn't great, but he also wasn't even close to being bad either. His performance fell somewhere in between, but more on the good side. Amy Smart also turns in a solid performance playing both a beautiful college hottie and a drugged up prostitute. I must say though that this film is MUCH darker than expected. I mean this is borderline \\"Seven\\" material. There are some scenes and talk about child pornography, a demonic kid who kills animals and threatens to kill people, a fat annoying gothic roommate (he was disturbing to me!), and many other images of discomfort. Both versions of the film are great, but The Director's Cut is the true version that should be seen, because this was the original superior version before the studio heads wanted a more happy flow to end the film with. This film also boasts some nice Special FX and a moving soundtrack. I couldn't believe that my 50-year-old mother loved the film as much as I did, so that truly shows that anyone over age 16 should enjoy this movie. If you can see through the grisly darkness (which was actually thrown in to tap into your own emotions about disturbing issues) then you will be rewarded with one of the best films of last year. Ignore the critics and judge for yourself. I know I will from now on!
B00028HBKM|5.0|I know there was controversy surrounding this film I don't know why though I t is for the most part taken straight out of the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. <BR>The performances were powerhouse. Bravo Mel Gibson.<BR>I didn't even mind subtitles through out the movie.
0385336810|5.0|I found the heroine to be so engaging I went back and read the other three books by the same author.  'Can You Keep A Secret?' has the same tone as Sophie Kinsella's first three books.  Light, funny and full of hiliarious bumps in the road.  Great beach read.  Not at all like the standard love stories by long time great 'boy meets girl' authors.
B0001BKAEY|1.0|This movie sucks. Early in the morning. This movie sucks late in the evening. This was the dumbest movie I have ever seen. Why didn't the machines have covers over the top? Why did they blind Neo? Why did it take Trinty what seems like the entire movie to die? How many chins was Laurence Fishburn going to get? What was the point of the movie if the Matrix was not destroyed? This movie would have better served me as toilet paper. i hope this review was helpful.
B00024BHTC|5.0|This is one of the best Nightwish CD's out there. I own all 6 CDs. They are by far my most favorite band. This CD is amazing. The band has been continuously evolving since the first album, Angels Fall First. Going from semi-acoustic mood music, to symphonic metal. The tracks on Once are much harsher and much harder than previous Nightwish CDs. You can relate it to Ocean Born in some sense, with its heavier sound. But Once still blows away Ocean Born. My favorite track on the CD is &quot;Dark Chest of Wonder&quot;. And Tuomas wrote the most amazing chorus i have ever heard. The Chorus to Ghost Love Score gives me shivers down my spine. If you are just getting into Nightwish, this might not be a good CD to start with. Nightwish is an aquired taste. A good CD to start with would be Century Child. My second suggestion would be Wishmaster. But i highly recomend Once to any Nightwish fan, or to anyone who loves heavy guitar riffs mixed with a melodic orchestra and choir. Can't wait for the tour to hit Worcester in August.
B000006045|5.0|I guess I just need to put in my two cents in this sea of reviews (most of them good, obviously) for this album.  I fell in love with this album in the summer of 1998.  I listened to it while reading the 4th book in the Dark Tower series by Stephen King.  They meshed perfectly.  The dark, haunting synths, downbeat droning guitar, and spine tingling vocals on this album are simply amazing.  I had never heard anything quite like it before, or since.  Massive's earlier works are not as dark and moody, and their later work is a little too innaccessible for most people (though I absolutely loved it!).  Buy this album! Dont hesitate!  Do it NOW!!!  SPEND, YOU AVID CONSUMER YOU!!!!<br />Whew!  'Nuff said.  Bye!
B000094DUP|5.0|This cd is awesome! The songs are very touching and perfect to listen anywhere! I love this. I highly recommend it to anyone!
B00005AQF7|5.0|Truly a classic, but sadly Snoop could never out do himself after this first bangin' LP. There's not a bad track on it. And a note to all the reviewers who bashed it, they obviously don't appreciate the genre (gangsta rap), or cannot understand it. Buy if you don't already own it.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|This is a must-see. And it's not a easy way to define this film. This is for everyone, no matter of your sex, your age, your attitude to fairy tales, to cartoons or to music. \\"Shrek\\" has it to surprise and to enjoy each and everyone of your family or even none of your relatives.<br />It is easy to see with every kind of company. It's sweet, it's bitter. It's plenty of laugh and plenty of love. Music is really a big part of the film and every tune is perfect. I don't know of anybody who dislike this film. Extremely enjoyable.
B00014K5TQ|2.0|I had a hard time liking this movie, mainly because Michael Alig is such a likable guy and Macaulay Culkin is just so creepy to watch though he does play a gay man remarkably well.  Seth Green acts his role but never comes off as comfortable in it and who could blame him.  Alig lived life over the top and the movie plays everything over the top.  The peek inside the infamous Limelight club is interesting and you'll laugh so hard you'll wet yourself at Marilyn Manson who has a minor role but in the end the documentary that chronicles Alig and the murder of \\"Club Kid\\" Angel is much much better.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|Very talented guy. I consider him an upbeat John Mayer with a piano. Very good cd. Before I bought the cd, I didn't know who he was.. just was told by someone that I might like the cd (boy where they right). But once I got the cd, some of the songs seemed to be familiar to me, and I had heard them before and liked them. But it's definately worth the money!
B00004YW6I|4.0|This album simply has some of Polly's funnest songs.  Big Exit, Hustling, and This is Love are simply fun, adrenaline-pumping (if not sexually arousing in the case of This is Love) songs that are better than most of the so called thrashing rock that is played on our radio stations.  I think some of the dissent against this album comes from the fact that it's so \\"pop-rocky\\", well, maybe so, but if it's done well, so what?  And yeah, This is Love is not T.S. Elliot when it comes to poetic lyrics, but it's just a FUN song no matter who wrote it.  So many people are overly enamored w/ the depressing side of Polly Jean, and I loved Is This Desire? too, but you take the songs for what they are.  The guitar work of \\"This is Love\\" also straddles the line between minor and dominant tonality, and that helps to give it a grindy, seductive sound.  \\"We Float\\" has a beautiful vocal line, and is a good ender to the album, solemn yet resilient, a hope earned through suffering that is perfectly reflected by PJ's passion and melody.  A good solid rocking album w/ enough maudlin pieces to satisfy that fix, I'd still rank \\"Is This Desire\\" ahead of it, but not by much, and I'd take this album over \\"Rid of Me\\" and \\"To Bring You My Love\\".
B00023BKMM|5.0|This movie kept me on the edge of my seat!  I thouroughly enjoy watching Johnny Depp.  He brings such realism to his characters.  He always adds his own special touch.  I did not expect the ending to turn out the way it did.  I will purchase this movie for my personal library.  I LOVE YOU JOHNNNY DEPP!!!
B00008H2LB|1.0|linkin park is a disgraceful band, and this cd is disgraceful. they have no talent. almost every single one of chester's vocal lines sounds exactly the same, which just shows how much he blows. and then you have his hip-hopper side kick who throws in a cheesy rap line every now and then. give me a break. somebody needs to clock that guy. and i could take a whiz on a guitar and make it sound better than their guitarist plays. this is rediculous. its music for immature 12 year olds. the lyrics sound like stuff i might have written when i was 8. all it is is whine whine whine. this is not quality music at all. you can tell that none of the people in this band even really care about the music they're putting out at all, they just want to get popular and make lots of cash so they can have hot girlfriends. i dont hate them because they're mainstream, i hate them because they suck. everybody is free to listen to whatever they want to listen to and like whatever they want to like, but if you listen to this band then you would be lying to yourself if you said that you listened to quality music. all you're listening to is the latest trend. i have ceased to talk to a fan of this band who is not ignorant, immature, and who thinks for theirself. the blind leading the blind. nuff said.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|&quot;Spellbinding&quot; is the word that comes to mind when I think of director Errol Morris's &quot;The Fog Of War.&quot; I sat riveted for the documentary's run time, 107 minutes, and experienced a gamut of emotions as I watched former Secretary of Defense, (under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson), Robert Strange McNamara, tell his off-screen interviewer the whys and wherefores of the US War in Vietnam. Most of the film features Robert McNamara talking to the camera - no flashy post-production elements are needed. The interviewee provides more than enough drama. Mr. McNamara was one of the war's architects and he goes through all the events leading up to the escalating conflict that became &quot;our Vietnam,&quot; giving the viewer a behind the scenes perspective. The film is annotated with some amazing archival footage and declassified White House tapes. Much of this film footage is new to me, and I have seen a fair share from this period.<br />I grew up in the 1960s and lost many friends and classmates in this seemingly never-ending tragedy. I watched many who survived come home maimed in body and spirit. I don't know why Robert McNamara decided to make this documentary, one of the best I have ever seen, but anyone interested in history, especially the period surrounding the Vietnam conflict, will appreciate this eye-opening account. The film may raise more questions than it answers. It does, however, provide a credible firsthand account from a man at the center of the action. Hopefully, our national leaders, past present and future will see it and benefit from it.<br />McNamara selected eleven lessons, (philosophical maxims), of life he believes most important, and these provide the documentary's framework. Morris succinctly chronicles McNamara's life, painting a portrait of an American giant, with such impressive credentials and intellect that President Kennedy spent some significant energy wooing him away from his job as President of the Ford Motor Company - the first non-Ford to hold that title - to become part of his cabinet. His past experience, and his ability to think and reason enabled him to quickly move into his new position as leader of the Department of Defense and major policy maker. However, as Mr. McNamara stresses in one of his lessons, &quot;reason has its limits.&quot; One of McNamara's main themes throughout seems to be that even when dealing with intelligent, rational men, the baser parts of our nature often come to the fore. History demonstrates that apparently we don't learn from our mistakes. Morris doesn't have to specifically draw parallels to today's international situation for the similarities to be striking.<br />The eighty-six year old former Secretary appears to be in full command of his intellectual powers as he recounts what he learned from the Cuban missile crisis, and details some other experiences, such as his contributions to the World War II firebombing of Japan under General Curtis LeMay. He reflects on his successful work during WWII and asks, &quot;How much evil must we do in order to do good?&quot; He points out that, had the United States lost the war, he and LeMay would probably have been tried as war criminals. Reflecting on both Japan and Vietnam, he asks, &quot;What makes an act immoral if you lose a war and not immoral if you win?&quot; Of course, it is the victors who write history and determine what is justified.<br />Many on the political left have criticized Morris for not being &quot;tough enough&quot; with his questions and follow-ups. But this documentary is Mr. McNamara's story, as he sees it, in retrospect, and as he chooses to tell it. It is not an oral history, per se, it is more - the story of one man in the seat of power at a critical period in our nation's history. The focus is on Robert McNamara's integrity and beliefs and the manner in which he explains and rationalizes his part and place in history. He does accept a degree of culpability for Vietnam and for Japan. I may be overly sentimental, but I was transfixed by McNamara's expressions and emotions throughout. This is one man, I believe, who bears a heavy burden and has carried it for a long time.<br />Philip Glass's mesmerizing, somewhat edgy, score provides a haunting backdrop to the film. Foggy images, the ghosts of the war dead, float across the screen at various points, interspersed with McNamara's logical narrative, quoting statistics of death, percentages, numbers. Towards the documentary's conclusion, McNamara refers to the fact that &quot;the human mind cannot comprehend all the variables&quot; in war and finds itself overwhelmed...as if in a fog. Thus he supplies the movie's title - a phrase meaning that war involves variables too complex for the human mind to grasp.<br />Even if you don't usually watch documentaries, see this one. It is stunning!<br />JANApan. I may be overly sentimental, but I was transfixed by McNamara's expressions and emotions throughout.

B00005JMEW|1.0|I LOVED Kill Bill!  It is one my favorite films of 2003 and I can't wait to own my personal copy, but now is not the time.  It has been stated by the producers of the film that after Kill Bill vol. 1 and vol. 2 are out there will be a boxed set of the two.  After the boxed set they plan to release special editions of the films (which may or may not be the versions shown in Japan) and the special editions are planned to be released in single and then boxed set form as well.  Heck, you might be able to buy boxed sets with the original and special edition versions together.  All I know is that with the insane price of Kill Bill vol. 1 it's much better to just sit it out and wait a few more months for the other versions to be released.
0451450523|2.0|Beagle is a gifted writer and the story line is original with great potential.  Unfortunately, the telling of the story can't decide if it is fantasy or parody.  Or perhaps it is parody and I wanted it to be fantasy.  Beagle builds beautiful images with his prose only to topple them with flippant dialog and pointless actions.  The ending is completely unsatisfying.  Throughout the story, tension builds over the Red Bull, the nemesis of the unicorn, but when a confrontation takes place, the scene dissipates benignly and the story coasts to a bittersweet end.<br />There are many elements here to enjoy, so it is worth the read; just don't expect too much.  If you're looking for good fantasy, keep looking.
B0002234LS|2.0|Johnny Depp did a great job with the character (s) he played. But the movie is pretty slow and boring until the crazy ending. I find it hard to believe that they rated this movie PG-13! Iv'e seen R rated movies that didn't have as much blood and swearing in them as this one! Now parents will be angry after they show their kids a movie that should have an R rating! As for the movie, somebody definatly needs some psychotherapy. Movies like this are only making society crazier! Stick with normal movies.

B00005OWEG|5.0|PLOT(minus spoilers): We follow five soldiers, led by Sheen's character, as they head out on an assasination mission. The target is a C/O(Brando) who's apparently gone AWOL, having began to slaughter the enemy without orders as well as become a godlike figure in the eyes of many indigenous people in the area, virtually turning them into his warrior slaves. Upon traveling to find the C/O, Sheen becomes strangely intrigued by his military tactics, tactics so swit and terrible that even the VC have become fearful of him. The military, meanwhile, has assured Sheen's character that this commander is indeed insane, but it's the journey up river in which we see......<br />.... EVERYTHING out on the river is insane. Posts are manned without commanders, officers(Robert Duvall) are more fixated on surfing and Play Boy Playmates than their present battle. During these segments, when we move - almost drift - from scene to scene, we begin to see this Vietnam as something different, something more vague and faintly evil than we could ever had dreamt up.  This side of the world has gone mad, as Sheen's character soon begins to see ever more clearly. Even the men accompanying him begin to shift towards the other side of sanity. But don't fret, the way this shift is portrayed is a beautiful thing to witness, as is the irony of their endeavor - that, sent to kill an officer for going crazy, EVERYTHING is also crazy, and the AWOL officer makes perhaps the most sense.<br />I suppose this film reiterates all we thought we knew about Vietnam, only it happens in a way that both tears and swallows your preconceptions alive, forcing you to dig ever deeper into the madness that surrounded Vietnam.
B000001EC1|3.0|Bon Jovi's first greatest hits album is entitled &quot;Cross Road&quot;.   The title is appropriate because by the time of its release in 1994, the group had really reached a true crossroads in their career.  Bon Jovi had rode the wave of the hard rock/metal-like influence on the pop music scene in the late 1980s.  By the time of 1992's &quot;Keep the Faith&quot;, they still were doing what they do best - but now Alternative Music was beginning to dominate the pop scene.   Therefore, I think its very appropriate that the group put out a Greatest Hits album - and look back to determine what the next steps should be in their career.   This is what the band did on &quot;Cross Road&quot; - a compilation of 11 Bon Jovi songs spread over the groups' 5 albums (plus one Jon Bon Jovi solo effort) as well as the inclusion of 3 new tracks that are truly reflective of this &quot;crossroads&quot; theme.   <br />It's important to know that this is really a sampling of Bon Jovi's greatest hits.  This collection doesn't attempt to go deeper.   It really took the most popular songs from the group's previous albums and included them on one collection.  I think the reason for 3 new tracks was to try to attract the pure Bon Jovi fans who were looking for more   I was disappointed there was only 1 song from &quot;7800 Degrees Fahrenheit&quot; (&quot;In and Out of Love&quot;) and one song from the self-titled &quot;Bon Jovi&quot; album (&quot;Runaway&quot;) .  It is also worth noting that Bon Jovi has done other Greatest Hits compilations - such as the live album &quot;One Wild Night&quot; and the acoustic-sounding remake of their greatest hits on &quot;This Left Feels Right&quot;.  This is going to be the only pure studio recorded greatest hits album that has been released.<br />Of the three new songs, the best of the new songs is &quot;Someday I'll Be Saturday Night&quot;.  I feel the &quot;cross roads&quot; theme is very evident here as this has a very acoustic like theme to it.   JonBon Jovi has some great vocals, but it's Richie Sambora's guitar and background vocals are going to make this song stand out.  The lyrics are catchy and melody are both catchy.   Sticking with this &quot;cross roads&quot; theme, Bon Jovi re-recorded an acoustic, slower version of &quot;Livin on a Prayer&quot; - this one is just called &quot;Prayer 94&quot;.  On the &quot;This Left Feels Right&quot;, there is a much better acoustic recording of this song, but the Bon Jovi fans should still appreciate this song.   The group also includes the &quot;Slippery When Wet&quot; version of the song as well.   The final new song is &quot;Always&quot;.  Once again, this is consistent with the crossroads theme of a calmer, more mellow Bon Jovi sound.   Despite the fact that &quot;Always&quot; has more of a classic Bon Jovi sound with Jon's vocals and David Bryan's keyboards - this is a pretty weak song.  &quot;Always&quot; seems like it was custom made for Top 40 radio.   I was surprised that &quot;Always&quot; got the nod to be the single released over &quot;Someday I'll Be Saturday Night&quot;. One final note, I do think Richie Sambora provides some nice background vocals again on this single.<br />As for the other albums, &quot;Slippery When Wet&quot; is represented by the megahits &quot;You Give Love a Bad Name&quot;, &quot;Livin' on a Prayer&quot;, and &quot;Wanted Dead or Alive&quot;.  &quot;New Jersey&quot; is represented by &quot;Lay Your Hands on Me&quot;, &quot;Bad Medicine&quot;, and &quot;I'll Be There for You&quot;.   &quot;Keep the Faith&quot; is represented by &quot;Keep the Faith&quot; and &quot;Bed of Roses&quot; (I thought that &quot;In These Arms&quot; should have also be included).  &quot;Blaze of Glory&quot;, the single that Jon Bon Jovi recorded for the &quot;Young Guns II&quot; movie (from the &quot;Blaze of Glory&quot; album he recorded) is also included on here.  I think &quot;Blaze of Glory&quot; is a great song, but it isn't a pure Bon Jovi song and Iwould have liked to see another song by the full band included in place of this song.<br />The liner notes for this album are extremely poor.  The credits are pretty poor as well - there basically are some footnotes making it tough to read. There are no lyrics included for any of the songs (including the new ones).  There are pictures of the album covers, but the associated albums the songs are from are not corresponded with the songs.   I also thought it was interesting that a picture of the album cover from Richie Sambora's album is included, but yet none of his solo stuff is included while one of Jon's solo songs was.  Much of the liner notes is a fold-out into a picture of the band in a New Jersey diner with a pseudo autograph &quot;Thanks for Believing&quot; signed by Jon Bon Jovi.  The songs aren't in chronological order and usually I prefer a greatest hits album to go in that order.<br />I'm hoping that the band eventually will release a boxed set that goes much deeper with their music portfolio.   This album is a nice way for someone to get an introduction to Bon Jovi.   It also does keep with theme of &quot;Cross Road&quot;, so that is a plus.   However, if you are a pure Bon Jovi fan - stick with the original studio albums.  Finally, once Bon Jovi reached this &quot;cross roads&quot; in their career - I don't think the band was ever the same in terms of their later releases and never captured the magic of the earlier days.
B000002JKS|1.0|this has to be one of the worst tapes   i have ever bought.the only redeaming   song on this thing is little by little  and compared to his older material,just doesn`t add up.
B00005K3O4|5.0|If you like your movies with extra cheese then this is just the movie for you. It's probably one of the worst and corniest I've ever seen but that's what makes it so entertaining.  Perfect for a rainy Saturday afternoon or if you are in the mood for a light movie with goofy humor.  Definiately not Oscar material but then again it was never meant to be.
B000002B5L|5.0|The Fugees are definitely the most complete group of all times. TLC, WuTang, etc all are real good groups, however The Fugees integrated every form of music into rap and made hiphop globally respected. Their themes and videos were the best of all times. The Score is really a street classic. From &quot; Ready or not&quot;, cowboys, &quot;the beast&quot;. Everything is tight. Lauryn is fascinating though. She really makes fugees what it all is. their breakup is a great loss to the enrichment of hiphop.
B000000OXH|1.0|&quot;Forgotten masterpiece&quot;??!! Are you kidding? I wish all &quot;forgotten masterpieces&quot; cost only US$ 6,98 like this album!<br />This album is a disaster. It's unbeliavable that the same line-up of Howe, Wetton, Downes and Palmer recorded this piece of trash after their majestic self-tittled debut.<br />This is some of the worst &quot;pop-progressive&quot; (call it what you want) things ever recorded in the eighties, and it's more painful due to the high caliber of the musicians involved. The album is nothing more than a collection of sugar souless pop albums that I bet Steve Howe still feels ashamed today! In the mix, add some of the worst ballads ever written. The production is slick to the bone. Don't believe the absurdly high ratings this album is taking here!
B00000ADG2|5.0|Lauryn is one of the most versatile people in the business. She's amazing in all the categories. She's a songwriter, producer, rapper, poet. I mean this lady truly is wonderful. She always carries a message with her unique rock hard flows and rhymes she gives like no one else. This album is for any fan of music, not only rap, or Rnb. But anyone who wants something good to hear. She talks about the truth of the world and criticizes evil. Go and get it and sleep on it till the entire album sinks in your pulse.
B0001IN0DA|5.0|What an awesome DVD to own! The WWE did a great job promoting Wrestlemania XX, and to me the show was just enough to live up to the hype.  I don't think it was the best Wrestlemania I have ever seen, but very entertaining.  Just hearing the intensity from the crowd at the very begining mad things exiting.  This was definetly the best Wrestlemania since 17.  The 3-disc set is worth every penny.  Besides the great show, we get pre and post game interviews, plus promos.  In Addition, we get clips of the ten greatest matches in up untill Wrestlemania 19 inWrestlemania history, hosted by ric flair.  Also, the set includes results, facts and photo galleries from the first 19 Wrestlemania's, furthermore there is are sevral sets of Wrestlemania Trivia avaliable.  The best match of the night was certainly the main event, as Chris Benoit finally got the title he deserved.  Other great matches included Guerrero Vs. Angle, Christian Vs. Jericho, and the resurection of the Undertaker was a true Wrestlemania moment.  I give the WWE massive credit on the job they did for Wrestlemania XX.
B00002ND77|5.0|Movies are never good as the book, but its good to see a visual. One thing I didn't like about the movie is the way they protrayed  Elijah Mahammad. <BR>This movie changed my life,  for someone like me in High School that didn't like to read. lol It was becasue of this movie I joined the Nation Of Islam when I was 18. I figured I would go to the source, Malcom X just repeated  what Elijah  said, and look how great he became. Malocom X was so great, but always thought he would come back to the N.O.I....Give thanks to Malcom X our living Ancestor...
B0000039PW|5.0|It's sad that B.I.G get dissed by some people, even though he been dead for 7 years, and he was (one of) the best MC ('s) to ever approach a mic. Chris &quot;The Notorious B.I.G&quot; Wallace (along with 2Pac) is basically the best rapper alive and/or dead. Need evidence? Just listen to B.I.G's album READY TO DIE. Every track is legendary, and carries the lyrical and instrumental weight to make this a 5-star hip-hop album. Like the chorus in &quot;Unbelievable&quot; says, Biggie Smalls is the illest (best)...Anybody who disrespects Biggie or this album basically assed themself out. I mean, not only do you hear Biggie's masterpiece lyrics, but also fire-hot instrumentals from the best producers. Along with Easy Mo Bee, Chuck Thompson, and the Trackmasters, you have Digga, P. Diddy, and the great DJ Premier; who produced &quot;Unbelievable&quot;. In my eyes, that song is the best that he did on this or any album of his. Then to think that a 10-year anniversary edition of this LP is comin' out on Tuesday, makes more reason to believe, that this is a CD worth the money and the praise.

B00005Q4CS|5.0|Requiem for a Dream centers around four people, all with their own addictions.  Sara Goldfarb is obsessed with a self-help game-show on TV, and when she recieves a call saying that she will become a contestant she uses diet pills to help her loose weight.  Harry is the son of Sara who is a heroin addict that shoots up with his friend (friend with the connections) Tyrone and his girlfriend Marion.  All these addictions throw the characters into a journey towards insanity.<br />Aronofsky, the director of the film, uses unique cuts frames and camera tecniques that perfectly display what is going on within and outside each character.  You must see this film.
1592400876|5.0|\\"Eats, Shoots & Leaves\\" is not a grammar guide per se, as it doesn't really teach the basics of punctuation. Instead, it's a grammarians dream come true - an enjoyable and illuminating discussion of the history and importance of punctuation (Hmmmm, did I use that dash correctly?). Lovers of punctuation have been decrying the use of \\"netspeak\\" with no or minimal punctuation. Accordingly, Truss wrote this engaging book with the rallying cry: \\"Sticklers unite!\\" However, Truss does not simply attack the web; indeed, she asserts that text messaging and email have made reading more important than it has been of late. However, to paraphrase Bill Clinton, \\"It's the punctuation stupid!\\"<br />Truss's dry British wit (e.g., talking about wanting to marry the inventor of the colon) is used to great effect in her writing. And amusing vignettes are peppered through the text, including the introduction of the \\"interrobang\\" as well as the spread of the \\"Strukenwhite\\" virus. She even manages to make punctuation seem, well, sexy. If you've ever found yourself in a spirited debate about the Oxford comma (i.e., the second comma in the phrase \\"red, white, and blue\\"), then you'll likely enjoy this book.<br />Some reviewers have asserted that American readers may be a bit lost; however, Truss is careful about pointing out American versus British punctuation uses. I was never confused. Overall, this book is delightful - most highly recommended.
0385334176|5.0|The first Vonnegut book I ever read, and the strangest I feel. The kid shoots some guy from a tower and his whole life falls apart due to that one event. He writes an atrociously parochial play that gets laughed at in the Big Apple of America. When writing about the failures of everyday life humanity, Vonnegut is at his best. This has all of the most tragically funny events and characters woven into a nauseous tale. My favourite part is where the kid who writes the play, writes his own script of the situation of his brother arguing with his brother's girlfriend. Some call it black humour, I think that doesn't do it's creativity justice. A must read!
B000069CWE|5.0|This album, in my mind, is without a doubt, Linkin Park's best album.  They experiment more with a hip-hop/hard rock cross that comes off with a very original style, worthy of recognition.  I myself am a hard-core fan of underground hip-hop, not the ridiculous rap you hear more than often on the radio, but the clever, positive messages that intertwine their way through the master wordplay of a talented emcee.  Oddly enough, &quot;Reanimation&quot; showcases some of the most talented underground emcees, backed with EXACTLY the potent, emotional production and melodies they need to showcase their talent.  This is rap, rock, and music in general at it's very best.  <br />Linkin Park actually doesn't need any help in the production area of things, but even so, just to be absolutely sure they prove that they will not be musically outdone, the sophomore rock group recruits the talented Kutmasta Kurt, Alchemist and Evidence, among others.  I suppose this is needed, since this is technically a remix album, though I can see Linkin Park handling this aspect of the album without any help.<br />Linkin Park's emcee is very talented, all by himself, however, he has one of those voices that needs variety to counter-act him.  His lyrics are strong and his flow is fluent, he just needs a different sound to break the monotony of his flow on every track.  Linkin Park does a superb job of balancing the chemistry of this album.  Track 5, &quot;FRGT/10&quot; is one of the best cuts on the whole CD, the original Linkin Park track being remixed by talented Alchemist.  Lyrically, however, Chali2Na stands out like a floodlight in the dark.  If only his verse was a little longer!  Track 5 is nowhere near the only worthy track on this CD.  Track 9, although lyrically very odd (seeing as it focuses largely on X-Men type of superpower), is a genius cut.  Linkin Park this time calls in the talented rhyme and production masters of Dilated Peoples, Evidence and DJ Babu. That's not the end of it though.  The grand finale is easily Pharoah Monch's magic touch on the track, courtesy of my favorite record label, Rawkus.<br />Finally, we make our way to the BEST track of the CD.  13.) &quot;PPR:KUT&quot;, remixed by Cheapshot and Jubacca, featuring the underground master emcees Rasco and Planet Asia.  They blow every other song on this record out of the water, adapting their flow to Linkin Park's cryptic, dark, and emotional sound with lines like &quot;Now it feels/like my back's against the wall/I'm taking the fall/Whenver I call/nobody's responding at all/But I don't know who I can trust/they're screaming my name/I need somebody to help me out of the flame.&quot;  When written down, these rhymes may not be terribly impressive, but the passionate delivery that accompanies them makes them great.<br />Overall, I recommend this CD to anyone who admires good musicianship, anybody with versatile tastes in music, and any fans of good rock or hip-hop.  A very, very solid showcase of Linkin Park's talent, as well as the overlooked skills buried in the underground hip-hop market.
B00006CXXU|4.0|Its surprising that such a talented girl who produced such a beautiful album went on tour with a hyena named Justin Timberlake. Anyways, I've read 1 star reviews for this album, and I'm thinking to myself that &quot;what?&quot; These one star reviews are irrelevant and unnecessary due to the fact that there is nothing about the album or the songs. They just come to a conclusion, &quot;oh, i may have never listened to the album but still i'm gonna give this album a bad review cuz i don't like her&quot;.<br />WAKE UP EVERYONE, AMAZON.COM ALLOWS YOU TO WRITE REVIEWS FOR AN ALBUM, NOT DISSING AND ARTIST. YOUR SUPPOSED TO HAVE LISTENED TO THE ALBUM. IF YOU DIDN'T LIKE ONE OF HER SINGLES OR VIDEOS THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE WHOLE ALBUM IS BAD. COME ON EVERYONE, HAVE SOME THINKING. <br />This album is full of great rock/pop/r&amp;b songs. <br />The stand out songs are:<br />Cruz: The best song on the album. She displays her vocal talents here. <br />Make Over: Now that is a hard rock song. Can't get any better than this. <br />Dirrty: I love the song and the video. I wish Redman was not in it though. <br />Beautiful: speaks for itself<br />Im Okay: The most autobiographical song she has released. Its about how her dad somehow mistreated her but still professes that he loves her. <br />Can't Hold Us Down: second best song on the album. I love Lil Kim. I also give her more props for the kid who did the moonwalk in her video. Its always great to incorporate genius inspirations like Michael Jackson into your work. <br />Soar: beautiful ballad<br />Fighter: Like the song, not the video<br />Voice Within: Love the song, not the video<br />Keep On Singing My Song: I love this song!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />Christina overshadows Britney and Justin. Its a shame that her talent hasn't overrided Britney's success.
B000002UAO|5.0|And VH1 was in agreement,as they said it was the 6th greatest album ever! Thousands of music luminaries,fans and critics were polled,and Ruber Soul was declared one of the all time greats,with about the only higher ranking albums being other beatle albums!!!
B00005JMEW|5.0|I must first say that this is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.  When a female assasin (Black Mamba) wakes up from a four year coma, that was induced by the brutal beating she took from her fellow assasins, she goes to seek revenge.  It is a hilarious and bloody adventure to KILL BILL.
B00005JMYG|1.0|This movie sucked so bad that we left within the first 7 minutes after it started.  It was one of the worst movies we have seen. Was not funny, jokes were lame and bad, and the story just dragged on, making those 7 minutes seem like an hour. We ended up spending more money (and it was worth it) to see another movie. We would not recommend this show to anyone.
0767817478|2.0|I'm a fanatic of the original Kaiju flicks, inclunding the first period of Godzilla era(1954-1975). So as the header implies, i didn't like this movie. Just to make it clear, i'm judging beyond the special f/x, the soundrack and all kind of technical details. What i'm geting into is the essens of this movie by Devlin &amp; Emerich which, in my opinion was totaly wrong and innapropriate.<BR>   To tell you the truth, i enjoyed all the other effords of these sci-fi creators but i hated this one.O.K., in order to make myself clear i'll write 2 paragraphs just to explain why people who aren't font of the original Godzilla films enjoy this one and people who love the original rubbersuit bigfella, just despise it.<BR>   First of all the movie is well made. It has an ok script, its well directed, with talented actors and plenty of action. The visual effects get an A+ and hold up till now. The sound effects are also top of the natch and will make any home cinema out there rock. You know, all the above are more than satisfactive for most of the sci-fi action-adventure followers. But my guess is that everyone else who'll watch it just for the fun will be fully repaid. Despite some cheesy plot turnovers and some out-of-time comical enstandes the film is watchable for the majority of people.<BR>   <BR>   And that's where Classic Japanese Kaiju belivers come along. I haven't really got into population percentage for this kind of audience, but my guess is that it does not excide 1% of the active cinefuns worldwide. Maybe i'm more than optimist even for the number above. The problem with us is that we excist and we have an opinion which, i do agree, sometimed tends to be a bit annoying or peculiar for everyone else. But hey, thats us. And to tell you the truth i think it sould be us that mr. Devlin &amp; Emmerich sould firstly consider in order to shape this movie. Instead he blow off everything that had to do with the original monster keeping only what was critically nessesary forthe plot outline. But let me ask some retorical questions. <BR>   Why the hell he deform Godzilla into this? Wasnt the originall form good enough for him?<BR>   Where is the good old city wrecking and rampaging?Hasn't he watched wat the big G did everytime he entered poor Tokyo?<BR>   Where is G's atomic mouth ray?<BR>   Whats with the little jurassic park rip off Godzilla baby figres?as i recall Godzilla has a son and its name is &quot;Minya&quot;.<BR>   The only reason G was born was to travel in the showres and gave birth to younglings?<BR>   Are three airborn missiles enough to stop the big guy?(And if they are does it worth the efford to make a movie out of him?)<BR>   Where is the President of the u.s. isnt Godzilla a good reason for him to make an apearrance?who wants to see a mayor  a cernel and a seargent throughout the whole movie?<BR>   At last, wouldnt it be better for the film to come out with the different name like &quot;Rodzilla&quot; or &quot;Tortilla&quot;? <br />   I could continue till tomorrow but i hope everyone got the point with all the above. Thanx mr.Devlin &amp; mr.Emmerich.......Thanx for ruining every discent's Godzilla-fun day. It really took a lot for you to achieve this.
B0001MDP3G|1.0|This is what ruined it for me: Nicole Kidman looks like she stepped out of Vogue magazine in every single scene. Everyone else looks appropriate for the period, but there's Nicole: supposedly broke, hungry, and attempting to manage on a farm when she has no skills, looking utterly ravishing while everyone else has leaves &amp; twigs stuck in their hair. Poor Rene Zellweger looks like a mac-truck ran over her, having to play opposite Nicole with her ruby-red lips and perfectly coiffed hair. Unbelievable.<br />I think we've become so immune to bad film-making that we'll settle for anything, especially if its packaged as a costume drama. This film contained scene after scene of purely gratuitous violence that served no purpose other than to titillate the audience. The predicaments in which Jude Law's character find himself reminded me of The Canturbury Tales - it was almost comical, it was so ridiculous. Crappy movie.
0920668364|5.0|This is a wonderful story. It brings tears to my eyes each time I read it to my girls - and my girls love to hear it.  I give a copy to each and every friend and relative who gives birth and they have all loved it too. I have never read another book that so clearly defines unconditional love. Shame on those individuals who harbor so much unhealthy mental garbage that they cannot see the true emotional beauty in this story.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is sci-fi in the best sense.  It is a story about characters where the technology doesn't overwhelm the characterization.  In contrast to Gene Roddenberry's near utopian vision of the future, the people of Joss Whedon's 'verse still have some wrinkles to work out.    The highest of tech is something only the core worlds can afford.  Out on the rim, people make do with whatever they can.  Sometimes this means that they farm and raise cattle and expend a lot more sweat and time doing it the old fashioned way.    Serenity is a Firefly class transport ship commanded by Malcolm Reynolds, an officer on the losing side of the recent galactic civil war (Independents vs. Alliance); his first mate Zoe fought at his side during the war.  The other characters include the mercenary known as Jayne, the engineering miracle worker Kaylee, Zoe's husband, the pilot, Wash, and the (nod, wink) Ambassador, Inara.  Inara is a Companion, one of a guild of cultured, well trained, well... high class call girls.  She provides a little 'respectability' to the crew, allowing them to go places and get jobs they might otherwise be unable to.    Mal takes jobs both legal and illegal, anything to keep Serenity flying, but he has a strong sense of right and wrong.  In the course of things, the crew picks up Simon Tam and his sister River, fugitives from the Alliance as well as a man named Book who claims to be a Shepherd.  Many secrets remain untold about these passengers, some of which are revealed over the course of the series.    Firefly is wonderfully written, beautifully shot and acted and a joy in every way.  Its dramatic, scary, charming, adventurous, and laugh-out-loud funny.  I can hardly wait for the movie, Serenity, to continue the story of my favorite crew.  Serenity's still flying, and that's enough.
B00005V3Z4|3.0|Owes much to David Lynch's &quot;Lost Highway&quot; in terms of structure and narrative concept.  Sets a mood very effectively but the actual plotline is not effectively conveyed with the available film footing.  Reference the DVD features to get an impression of what was actually intended.  The film is otherwise mysterious and in some ways perplexing because it wanted to be two different movies, at least, and luckily some of the components meshed as if to convey a whole.  Worthwhile viewing though it's essentially a very beautifully filmed Twilight Zone ep plot-wise.

B000002KDO|5.0|Master Of Reality was Black Sabbath's third album and their followup to one of the best heavy metal albums of all time, Paranoid. Although this album is nearly as strong as Paranoid, it has become somewhat of a closet classic, only getting its just recognition from their diehard fans. While the songs here aren't as well known as the classics \\"Iron Man\\" and \\"War Pigs\\", most of the tracks are top notch and the band have recognized this by bringing some songs from this album into their set on the annual Ozzfest tours.<br /><br />Like most of their catalog, Masters Of Reality is at its best on the heavier material carried by their simple yet memorable riffs. The opening track \\"Sweet Leaf\\", where Ozzy Osbourne sings of his love of marijuana, is one of their best tracks. \\"Children Of The Grave\\", the best known song here and a staple of both Ozzy's solo band and Black Sabbath's live shows, is one of their great epics featuring a killer solo from Tony Iommi near the track's end. Also featured here are the excellent \\"Lord Of This World\\" and \\"Into The Void\\", the former featuring excellent counter bass lines from Geezer Butler while the latter is literally a riff tour-de-force.  The band also show hints of their changing musical direction which would come to fruition on their Volume 4 album on the acoustic instrumental \\"Orchid\\" and on the track \\"Solitude\\", a solemn piece featuring a soft vocal from Osbourne, laid back musicianship and a flute! By far, the most underrated track here is \\"After Forever.\\" Listening to the pro-Christianity lyrics, it's hard to believe that this was the same band that gave us the gloom and doom of their debut album. Simply put, next to Paranoid this is their best work and a must have for all heavy metal fans.

B000002KBA|3.0|\\"In Rock\\" is arguably one of the first true \\"heavy metal\\" albums.  It still stands as one of Deep Purple's best & \\"heaviest\\" works.   The sound on this cd version, however, leaves much to be desired.  I will swear my old lp sounds better. So 5 stars for the music, 1 star for the sound.  Your best option is to spend a few extra bucks on the Import \\"25th Anniversary\\" edition.  Unlike many \\"limited editions\\" & \\"remasters\\" the bonus tracks on the \\"In Rock 25th Anniversary\\" kick @ss thanks to some remixing by Roger Glover.  Again, pass on this one in favor of the better sounding and expanded Import version.

B00005ASOI|5.0|I suck at introductions so I'm not even gonna try. This movie is very good. I like it. If you are interested in Horror cinema or just visually intriguing films in general you need to check this out. All right then, on with the specifics.<br />The plot is easily summarized. Suzy Bannion is an American ballet student in Germany. There a bad goings-ons at the academy and she must investigate and defeat the evil to survive blah blah blah.  None of that really matters. Even the staunchest defenders of this film often admit that the plot/script/dialogue are not particularly inspired, and frequently kinda lame. I tend to agree with this belief, but as I said before, it doesn't really matter. However, contrary to what many people say, I didn't find this film to be the least bit confusing. I'll admit that not necessarily everything that occurs makes a whole lot of sense, and that some things are shown which are not terribly vital to the plot, but it's hardly difficult to follow. The acting isn't so great either, with the protagonists coming off a bit flat much of the time, and the antagonists overdoing it, particularly the whacky Miss Tanner, whose got a weird female concentration camp commandant thing going on.(or maybe I'm thinking of Madame Blanc, I get the names confused. If you see it you'll know who I'm talking about.) Still, it's a masterpiece visually.<br />When people talk about this movie they almost invariably describe it as being nightmareish. I don't really care for this description, because it exaggerates the surreality of the film. Visually, it isn't hyper-abnormal, it's really just surreal enough to seem just beyond the bounds of reality, so that nothing in the film seems quite real. This is particularly effective in the Academy itself, which mixes stately, classical looking architecture with extremely garish and tacky, extremely 70s-ish decoration. The night/horror scenes are all the more effective, with natural coloring being essentially abandoned, with everything then being bathed in eerie colored lighting.  The two most prominent colors are blue and red, with a smattering of green now and then. On the whole it is startlingly eerie, and can add immense power and atmosphere to scenes where essentially nothing happens. A good example of this comes when they are forced to sleep out in the ballroom due maggot infestation.(which is itself an example of a creepy thing that happens that has nothing to do with anything)  Nothing really happens here, but it's bathed in an intense, absolutely hellish red light which gives it immense power. To accompany these visuals is the much-hyped score by Goblin.  It is extremely effective, though occasionally weakened by the odd cheesy synth line. It's mostly eerie keyboard lines playing menacing, repetitious melodies, thunderous percussion and random, rumbling bass overlaid with demonic voices whispering and howling.  It also gets points for sounding like actual music, rather than the auditory exclamation points that most horror films provide you with.  Despite all this, this movie isn't all that scary, but it's pretty eerie and atmospheric, and is just damn cool.<br />The film suffers slightly from starting off too well, so it's unable to maintain it's level of excellence, and suffers from a rather anti-climatic ending. Still, the opening scenes of the film are absolutely great.  Suzy's arrival in Germany during a fierce storm sets the tone for the film, and establishes most of the visual motifs.  It is perhaps the most surreal portion of the movie, with the heavy rain obscuring most everything, and particularly random seeming uses of lighting.(The weird forest they pass through is especially cool)  The first murder scene, which is early in the film, is easily the best of the horror set-pieces.  Although it isn't really all that gory it's a truly brutal scene and ends with some genuinely horrific imagery.(I'll admit that the effects are dated, but they still work very well in this scene, imo)  The other horror scenes are reminiscent of the first, indoors, with the use of phony looking set decoration and colored lighting, with one exception.  It takes place out in the open, and the normal colors are abandoned, instead opting for utter blackness and plain white and grey coloring on the surrounding, neo-classical architecture.  It's also got some great, Leone-esque staging and camera work, as it drags the scene out as long as dramatically possible, alternating between extreme long-shots and extreme close-ups. It's a great scene (other than some dated gore) which is made all the more effective by how it contrasts with the rest of the film.(I should mention that despite the supernatural trappings of the film, the killings are generally done manually, with slasher-esque staging and methods. This film has witches, but they ain't much like what you usually see.)  As I said before, the ending isn't so great. It's a bit abrupt, and doesn't show us anything we haven't seen before, but just re-iterates old motifs in an inferior manner, and suffers from some bad acting on the part of the main antagonist.(Well, now that I think about it, it does have one great scare, which is unexpected and unlike what we've seen before, but overall it's just not nearly as good) Also, there's a scene with a bat which is unintentionally funny. That bat's just so damn adorable.<br />Well that's about it. Some flaws, but it's a horror masterpiece anyway., imo)  The other horror scenes are reminiscent of the first, indoors, with the use of phony looking set decoration and colored lighting, with one exception.

B0001LJC2K|5.0|I only heard Muse for the first time fairly recently and now I can't stop listening. I agree with some of the other reviewers that say they are much more similar to Queen than Radiohead although Matt Bellamy's voice is strikingly similar to Thom Yorke's. In fact, I have to confess that the very first time I heard them, I asked if it was Radiohead. But that was just going by the vocals and not the music. Anyway, Absolution is a brilliant album in it's complexity and pure beauty. I particularly love the songs that sound like a combination of rock and a symphony. Buy Absolution!!!
B000002B7O|5.0|In 1980, the deposed original lead singer of Black Sabbath, Ozzy Osbourne, made an absolutely brilliant career comeback with BLIZZARD OF OZZ, which went multi-platinum with its hard-hitting, well-produced sound featuring the lightning-fast riffage of young, up-and-coming guitarist Randy Rhoads. Hailing from California, and the original lead guitarist of the hard-working (but at the time, hardly known) Quiet Riot, Rhoads brought a very upbeat American sound to an otherwise all-British-veteran musical cast, and was an instant hit with the young crowd. Rounding out Ozzy's backing band were the well-respected Bob Daisley and Lee Kerslake on bass and drums, respectively. After a completely sold-out smash tour, Ozzy made his first in a long line of lineup shakeups, replacing Daisley &amp; Kerslake with Rudy Sarzo (not coincidentally, another Quiet Riot veteran) and Tommy Aldridge. Randy Rhoads was back in great form, branching out more so on this album; as a result, most songs don't start out like a &quot;Crazy Train&quot; clone. This album is more polished than the previous, and contains more of the wonderfully atmospheric keyboards by fifth member Don Airey. Ozzy's songwriting hits on familiar themes relating to individualism and what his eyes have seen.<br />Things get off to a fine start with &quot;Over The Mountain.&quot; As with &quot;I Don't Know&quot; from his 1980 solo debut BLIZZARD OF OZZ, Ozzy sure knows how to start his albums off in blistering form, with Randy Rhoads employing similarly fast riffing to great effect. Things get even better with the spirited &quot;Flying High Again,&quot; with begins with a rather slow guitar crunch and bass/drumbeat and, as a result, sounds very different from most songs of the Rhoads era. Although the pace picks up at the verse second-halves and choruses, and contains a more conventional-sounding Rhoads guitar solo, it shows that even the early Ozzy era has some variation in sound. It also shows that Italian-born Rudy Sarzowas truly one of the best bass guitarists around, being much more prominently featured here than he would be on Quiet Riot's first two releases in 1983 and '84, on which he would be sorely under-appreciated by the egomaniacal Kevin DuBrow. But the best song on the entire album comes next: &quot;You Can't Kill Rock &amp; Roll&quot; is an incredible anthem that begins like a ballad, with soft keyboards and low-register singing, till it whips into the hard-hitting choruses. Again, very different-sounding than other Ozzy songs of this era; in this case, even Randy's guitar solo sounds different! Don Airey gets a lot of quality time in on keyboards, creating a real multi-dimensional effect to this song.<br />&quot;Believer&quot; starts out with a menacing riff with sinister bells ringing in the background and is a deep, heavy track that is nevertheless polished to a smooth finish. &quot;Little Dolls&quot; begins with a pounding, syncopated drumbeat and rolls into a bass-heavy mid-tempo groove. Musically, it's a remarkably upbeat song (considering the voodoo theme) and features a surprisingly spacey-sounding guitar solo. &quot;Tonight&quot; is the album's ballad; more of a power-ballad than the light &quot;Goodbye To Romance&quot; found on the previous album, with one wicked Rhoads guitar solo. Again, Don Airey's light &amp; sweet keyboards punctuate the proceedings and creates a real ambience here. Clocking in at nearly six minutes, this song has pretty much everything; Randy Rhoads does a minute-long outro that is fast and fluid. It literally gives me goosebumps! <br />For the final stretch, we get the stomping &quot;S.A.T.O.&quot; (no, I don't know what the initials stand for), which has a real rollicking feel to it, and again sounds very different than anything on BLIZZARD OF OZZ. It has many quick stops &amp; starts and kind of reminds me of something that a great Southern Metal band would do, like Molly Hatchett, albeit in polished form. It fades out quickly &amp; goes right into the title song, which is an incredible 6:15 epic that has taken its rightful place as an all-time Ozzy classic. I love Ozzy's poetic, haunting lyrics as he sings eloquently about mental illness: &quot;Screaming at the window/Watch me die another day/Hopeless situation, endless price I have to pay.&quot; It's a great way to end a great album. Like BLIZZARD OF OZ before it, DIARY OF A MADMAN is a must-buy for any Ozzy fan.<br />MOST RECOMMENDED
B0001ENYKS|5.0|One of my favorite debut albums in recent memory. It got me hooked immediately and has yet to let go. Franz Ferdinand has really outdone any of the success they've either achieved or have yet to achieve.<br />Their debut is filled with sure-fire singles, bouncy post punk and dancefloor friendly rock. It seems everyone and their mother loves Take Me Out, and have no fear, the rest of the album follows that very high cue. Songs like Michael, Tell Her Tonight, Jacqueline or Darts of Pleasure could've easily traded places with the &quot;buzzworthy&quot; Take Me Out. The other tracks on here are hardly filler either. You have some hidden &quot;growers&quot; in the mix like Dark of The Matinee, which is now my favorite track on the record. This is one of those rare (recent) records that really kindles my love for music. It reminds me how I felt about like the first Strokes record, or the time I first heard The Rapture's - Echoes or Interpol's - Turn on The Bright Lights. Franz Ferdinand can take their place in my heavy rotation list for a long time on from now. I am very smitten.<br />I have a feeling this will competeing for one of the top spots on my best of the year list.
0201485672|4.0|Fowler's refactoring has become a classic in the field of popular software engineering books. It's a good book that clearly explains the basic ideas of refactoring and develops a standard vocabulary for refactoring; the power of this vocabulary is demonstrated by the development tools like IntelliJ Idea and Eclipse that now incorporate its nomenclature directly to allow rapid automated refactoring. Refactoring together with Test-Driven development, both concepts developed largely by Kent Beck as part of his Extreme Programming methodology, are in my opinion the most powerful and innovative ideas in the last 10 years or so in software development. It is a fairly quick read for an experienced developer, and often admittedly presents concepts that any experienced develop would have discovered on his/her own. Nevertheless, all of the refacorings together in one book serve as an excellent reference and reminder. I think this book certainly belongs on the bookshelf of any developer wishing to improve his or her craft.
1401200842|1.0|Looking for a good Batman story? Well, keep looking, because \\"Hush\\" isn't it. No, this is by far one of the worst Batman stories I've ever read. The likely fact that it was produced purely to make money and quite obviously devoid of any actual desire on the part of DC or Loeb to create a good comic is made obvious by the fact that a 12-issue story was published in two money-making volumes rather than one.<br />\\"Hush\\" has more holes in its plot than a piece of swiss cheese. The main villain remains a complete enigma even after the story is over. All the other villains that show up have an extremely strong feeling of \\"I'm just here so Jim Lee can draw me\\" behind them (I mean, did we REALLY need that sudden, unexplained, and way-too-short Scarecrow cameo?) Same for the needless appearance of Superman and the countless other guest stars. Events happen with no explanation, and by the end the \\"story\\" (such as it is) has become so muddled and, quite frankly, stupid that the ending doesn't even matter. The last page could have been a two-year-old's drawing of Batman taking a poop and it wouldn't have made the story any worse.<br />You want the truth about \\"Hush\\"? (Or at least what seems the likeliest explanation for this abomination?) DC wanted a way to boost sales of \\"Batman.\\" They decided to team up two fan-favorite stellar creators: Jeph Loeb and Jim Lee. All fine and good...or so one would think. What seems most likely is that either DC or Lee chose what characters would appear in the story so that Jim Lee could draw as many people as possible. Loeb was then left to create a story that would fit the umpteen-million characters in for Lee to draw. I guess he didn't try too hard, because this is all he came up with.<br />So, if you like stories that don't make sense, stories where Batman doesn't act like Batman, or stories that feature so many guest stars it feels more like a gallery than a story, then this just might be for you. If you like real, character-based, plot-driven stories, pass this by. PLEASE.<br />Or you can just be fooled by the pretty artwork (overrated, in my opinion) like everyone else.iven stories, pass this by.

B00005JMYG|4.0|Seeing the words: 'starring Will Ferrell and Christina Applegate' gave me the clue that I would be watching another golden performance from Ferrell himself. But I was still not prepared for how over-the-top and idiotic this film was.<br />On the other hand, however, I laughed the better portion of my head off - and so did most of the audience. And, when you think about it, that's not a bad way to spend a good 90 minutes in a dark movie cinema, is it?<br />The film tells the tale of Ron Burgundy, a vain, ridiculous, fictional San Diego television news personality in 1976 who's the #1 network news anchor in the local ratings and presumably based on 70s anchor Harold Green. A billboard says it all: 'If Ron Burgundy says it - it's true.'<br />He leads a pompous, sexist group consisting of redneck alpha-male sportscaster Champ Kind, played by David Koechner, sleazy Geraldo Rivera-like ladies man in Brain Fantana, played by Paul Rudd, and moronic weatherman, Brick Tamland, played by Steve Carrell, who rebel against the station's manager, Ed Harkin (Fred Willard) when a beautiful woman, Veronica Corningstone, played by Christina Applegate is brought in for diversity's sake.<br />Burgundy thinks diversity means an old, wooden Civil War ship, but soon falls for the blonde, curvacious former star of Married With Children head over heels.<br />Unfortunately, a run-in with a burrito, Jack Black on a motorcycle and Burgundy's pet pooch on the Coronado Bridge changes the newsman's life - for the worst (which results on a great scene). With Corningstone's star on the rise and Burgundy in decline, he falls into a three-month drunken stupor (on milk, no less) before an opportunity comes along to change his fortunes.<br />Like his previous turns in Old School and Elf, as well as most of his characters on Saturday Night Live, Ferrell is as hilarious in his addled simplicity and gives a very good comedic performance capturing the misogyny and ignorance of many 1970s male chauvinist pseudo-celebrities, especially those who populated local TV and radio stations before cable came along.<br />The silliness of the wild leisure suits, white shoes, overstarched hair, sideburns and mustaches is only matched by the gang fight scene in which Burgundy's group goes up against the likes of other newsmen, including Vince Vaughn, Luke Wilson, Ben Stiller and, of all people, Tim Robbins. <br />Though it sweetly preaches acceptance and equality, McKay's scattershot comedy is primarily founded on the premise that there's nothing funnier than dialogue strewn with ludicrously illogical lines, such as Burgundy, grief stricken over the sudden murder of his beloved Spanish-speaking dog Baxter (who he refers to as \\"a miniature Buddha covered in hair\\"), screaming to his friend from a phone booth, \\"I'm in a glass case of emotion!\\" Carell's brain-dead Brick randomly exclaims about women \\"I read somewhere that their menstruation attracts bears!\\" and Burgundy's vain crew engages in a weapon-filled rumble with Vince Vaughn's competing, second-rated local broadcast team in which the only rule is \\"No touching of the hair or face.\\" Anchorman's satiric skewering of the era's fashion, cheeky optimism, and sexism occasionally grows a bit stale, but it's hard to keep a straight face when somebody thinks San Diego means \\"a whale's vagina.\\"

B00005JMKI|5.0|If nothing else Dogville is like no other movie I have ever seen. In fact, after leaving the theater I felt more like I just read a good book or watched an excellent play. Like in many fine books Dogville utilizes quite effectively a narration, done masterfully by John Hurt, to help us understand the depths and layers of the subject matter. The movie opens announcing there will be a prologue followed by the unfolding of nine chapters. By the time the final chapter closes we feel as if we spent a lifetime with the movie's characters--and that's meant in a good way.<br />Dogville could be called the quintessential arthouse film. It's bold, provocative, risk taking and moody. It uses one large stage (throughout the whole movie), that reflects an exercise in minimalism. No real sets, no doors, no windows. All the walls were invisible, except the human ones. It chooses to use chalk outlines to portray dogs and gooseberry bushes. All this in an effort to help the viewer laser focus on the subject matter.<br />The Dutch director Lars von Trier, as evidenced by his \\"Breaking The Waves,\\" and \\"Dancer in the Dark\\" is anything but conventional. He is a man who is obviously housing a lot of pain and goes to great lengths to assure his viewers don't escape without sharing some of it. \\"Dogville\\" is no exception.<br />In response to any criticism claiming this movie carries an anti-American sentiment I say lighten up and watch the movie again. It's message is universal, has no nationality, and applies equally to all species of the human race. It just happened to take place in a small town in the Rocky mountains. It's about hypocrisy and pain. It's about suffering and healing and suffering again. It's about redemption and revenge. And crossroads, and missed opportunities.<br />Anyone going to therapy might want to skip a week and buy a ten dollar ticket to this film and see if you don't get just as much out of it. Yes the film is infuriating, painful and uncomfortable, but that's why it's so effective. It slyly slips deeply down into the human psyche where our guilt and anger manifest and somehow finds a way to bring it to the surface for us to confront.<br />Yes Dogville exaggerates the dark side of man (and woman) and magnifies its consequences, but as a result the message resonates and is impossible to ignore. Exactly what Trier was trying to do.<br />And special kudos to the whole cast, who's ensemble performance had to be no easy task considering the set limitations and surroundings. In my opinion Nicole Kidman will NOT get nominated for this film (though her performance was worthy) for two reasons. One, the movie's release is almost a year from next year's Academy Awards show. And two, even more importantly, not enough people would be willing to invest their time or risk exposure to this insightful masterpiece. This movie is one in a thousand. Unfortunately not one in ten thousand people are probably willing to ever give it a chance.<br />Mark Tushery it's so effective.

031286504X|2.0|Though historical in its genre, \\"I Am Legend\\" suffers from contradictions and poor storytelling. It's actually not worth all the hype when compared to most horror stories written collectively over the century. Boring, repetitive, and very slow paced, the book is solely based on a single man, of whom is immuned to a \\"disease.\\" This character, Robert Neville, watches everyone he loves die of the \\"disease\\" (which is shown through several flashbacks). Robert Neville is very hard to relate to, and even harder to feel sympathy for. He basically spends his evening locked up in his house listening to records, drinking. Most of the time the character just sits there, in the verge of hope and hopelessness.<br />It's also hard to understand why the \\"living\\" never killed him in the first place; they saved him for almost 3 years! They later send this woman to spy on him (I don't know why. I never really saw Neville as such a great threat, and even if he were, why did they keep him alive?) You tend to ask yourself that after you finish this book, because that's close to the ending, when he spots a woman.<br />If you're thinking about reading it, read it because you want to, not because you're bored; it won't entertain you if you are bored. It will fascinate you; then the fascination just slowly tappers off, leaving the whole book with just bland writing.
B0000640SA|1.0|I don't have to say much about this movie to let you know don't waist you time or money. I paid $21 for it through Columiba house. I relied upon the good comments of others before I bought it. It was boring, sensless, and a downright waist of time. If you must put yourself through such torture at least go rent it. The only movie that comes close to such idiocy is The Man Who Fell to Earth.

Brothers in Arms has been was used in 1985 for Miami Vice episode &quot;Out Where the Buses Don't Run&quot; - on of the best Vice episodes and then then turnaround and you find it used again in 2002 for West Wing for the post funeral segments of Mrs Landingham's  funeral, showing it's timeless appeal.<br />No one Dire Straits and this album just could not get any better.

B00006CXSS|5.0|This is by far the best WWII movie ever created I have the set and I have watched it many times it is a very bloody and violent movie but it is also a sad movie at times.  Often charectors that you have com to love will die in the most unlikley ways.  A man named Hoobler has a luger in his pocket and it shoots the arterie in his thigh and he bleeds to death.  This movie is not all tragedy and death though.  It is a very powerful film about soldiers that become closer than family and die for each other.  Anyone who does not give this movie a 5/5 is either an anti war person or just stupid.  I would give it a 10/5!!!
B00005JMYG|4.0|After watching this movie, I am still laughing about it. It is not meant to tell a great story, or be thought provoking it is just a movie to make you laugh. It did its job and made me as well as the entire audience in the theater I was at laugh. Will Ferrell gave a great performance, he never fell out of charachter and the appearnces from Vince Vaughn, Luke Wilson, and Ben Stiller were great. Go see this movie with an open mind and it will be great trip to the movies.

I have watched it several times, thinking maybe it was the mood I was in, but nope.  Matrix was a mind-blowing one-trick-pony that just did not stretch into to a second movie well.  There are a lot of interesting scenes, but Neo aka up up and away, just brought a giggle out in me.  The LONG action sequences make you want to go okay, enough!  Less is More is NOT the banner of this movie! After Neo b**** slap's Elrond and his brother Elrond and his other brother Elrond 100 times it just redefines redundant.  Then Neo reaching in to pull out the magic bullet...oh, please...sigh...and the religious overtones are so pretensious.<br />It was good to see Anthony Zerbe a long under rated talent get a nice spot.  The effect are good, just overdone ad nauseoum.  Elrond take the ship to into the West quickly!
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I am shocked that I don't see more good reviews of this album. I can't stop listening to it. ALOT of talent for such a young person. I would definately recomend this album.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|After hearing some of the reviews on this album, I thought it may be a waste of my money, but it turned out to be very good. A much edgier style to her voice as she is becoming even more of a teenager, understandably. The ones I enjoyed the most were &quot;Take Me Away&quot; which was very loud and rocky but extremely catchy, especially &quot;all the pain, I thought I knew, all the thoughs lead back to you...&quot;, &quot;My Happy Ending&quot; which has a bouncy, lively and cool sound to it, catchiest part: &quot;All this time you were pretending, so much for my happy ending&quot;, &quot;Forgotten&quot; which is a gothic, dark song which loads of people do not particularly like, catchies part: &quot;have you forgotten, everything that I wanted,do you forget it now, you never got it&quot;, &quot;Who Knows&quot; which is possibly the only happy song, catchiest part: &quot;Who knows what could happen, do what you do just keep on laughing&quot;, &quot;Fall To Pieces&quot;, a sad, romantic love song, catchiest part: &quot;I don't wanna fall to pieces, just wanna sit and stare at you&quot; and &quot;Freak Out&quot;, a bouncy, dance song that is really great, catchiest part: &quot;Just freak out let it go, then guitar stuff&quot;. Especially good ones: &quot;My Happy Ending&quot;, &quot;Fall To Pieces&quot;, and &quot;Freak Out&quot;. I HATE &quot;I Always Get What I Want&quot; - such a bratty song! Other not very good songs: &quot;Slipped Away&quot;, &quot;He Wasn't&quot; (although it's very catchy) and &quot;How Does It Feel. Overall, an excellent second album.
B000000OSG|5.0|Easily tied with some other albums for &quot;Greatest of All Time&quot;, &quot;Use Your Illusion II&quot; is the one review I kept putting off, not thinking I could ever be in the proper state of mind to give this piece of music the justice and worship that words can never express. Well, I've obviously started typing, so let's see what happens...<br />(Oh first of all let's get the &quot;Appetite&quot; and &quot;My World&quot; issues out of the way; yes, Appetite is wonderful and there's no reason to let any sort of comparison between these two albums impede the immense praise that is deserved by both. And yes, &quot;My World&quot; is an example of &quot;WTF, Axl?????&quot;. HOWEVER, you have over 70 of the most well spent minutes of your entire existence to experience from this album before the final two minutes, so how DARE anyone let &quot;My World&quot; affect the reaction towards &quot;Use Your Illusion II.&quot;)<br />Ok here we go. This album is epic (did I mention that?). When you are down and out, ready to give up, think all hope has gone, etc., etc..... you do NOT go to Nirvana. you do NOT go to Britney Spears. No, my friends (and enemies), you go to this album, track 11. There you will find the reason music exists. Heart and soul, blood and guts, tears, catharsis, anger, rage, emotion of the highest form, a purging of all of your demons: THAT is what will be injected into your veins when you listen to one of the greatest songs ever, &quot;Estranged.&quot; Unfortunately, songs like this were a major reason for the sad (and painfully slow) breaking of the fellowship that was known as the mighty original Guns. Axl was (and is) a control freak that dictatorially directed how the music was going to be. His grand schemes exhausted and frustrated his cohorts, who felt they were losing their voices in the band. As tragic as the break has been, I will offer up the condolences that if an album's creation pays that very highest price that can be paid (short of death), atleast the album created is &quot;Use Your Illusion II&quot;, and atleast it contains the song &quot;Estranged.&quot;<br />If you liked Guns N Roses after 1993 (such as I did), you were CRUCIFIED by the public. There's a lot of moral wrongs in society, and I'm not going to start comparing Nirvana fans to terrorists, but I will say that the nineties gave us blatant evidence as to why not enough people are open-minded and think for themselves. The music of Guns N Roses - the very music that was irrationally chastised for being mindless, talentless and overblown - is some of the most gut-wrenching, fist-clenching, serious and thought-provoking music out there. Just LISTEN to what Axl's actually ranting about. Just FEEL what Slash's Les Paul is really doing to your soul. It all comes together with this album. I love the Beethoven 9th as much as the next guy, but the grand finale to &quot;Estranged&quot; is the most emotional music I've ever heard. It may be from a rock band, but the point is, it's from THIS rock band. Learning &quot;Estranged&quot; on piano is what made me what I am today - instead of quitting piano, I majored in it. Instead of laying down to die in front of the door of the past decade of musical B.S., I vowed to go to my grave defending the music that really reaches out to people, trendy or not.<br />More than the already unsurpassable amount of blessing must be given to the fact that this is not an album with just one sound. Guns pulled off the project of pure human emotion with diversity! &quot;Estranged&quot; itself winds around into different keys, with different themes, and different moods. A real journey of body and mind. But just about every other song is of the same ilk. &quot;14 Years&quot; was just as influential on me, schooling me on some serious blues rock. I've never felt more conviction from any band's live performance than from the studio recording of this song! The entire band really seems to be letting off some serious steam in this one, so make sure you let it get into your blood! And speaking of letting off some steam, how about &quot;Get in the Ring?&quot; This is THE quintessential anger song. While a simple punk band can only really ever deal with anger in one dimension, Axl and co. really let you into a web of emotional complexity with their ability to actually PLAY their instruments (sorry, some of you might not know what that is). Granted, some of the lyrics are more blatant than a sledgehammer (&quot;When you're talking 'bout a vasectomy...&quot; ), but these lines are always offset by more crafty, if intense, ones (&quot;I sense a smell of retribution in the air&quot;). It should be noted that if you're one to be offended at times, the skip button was invented for the song &quot;Get In The Ring&quot;. Everyone else... rock on!<br />100 paragraphs each also go to &quot;Civil War,&quot; &quot;Breakdown,&quot; and &quot;Locomotive,&quot; (not to mention the epic-ifying of a pretty basic Dylan tune, &quot;Knockin' On Heaven's Door,&quot; and the alternate [better] lyrics for &quot;Don't Cry,&quot; and don't forget Arnold [&quot;You Could Be Mine&quot;]!!!)...but I've made my point and Amazon only allows 1000 words. Just imagine &quot;Estranged&quot; done 10 times over and you've got the album...the MASTERPIECE.<br />Bottom line about the timelessness to these wonderful songs, this album is FRESH. While some bands' music does sound dated and stale, nomatter how many times I start up &quot;Civil War,&quot; I feel myself taken to a new dimension. The songwriting, playing, band-chemistry, recording, mixing, timing.... it all comes together on this album better than just about any other. If you are in need of therapy, and/or if you like rock music, and/or if you are human, &quot;Use Your Illusion II&quot; is the all-purpose pinnacle.<br />If you find these opinions to resemble your own, you are highly encouraged to email!
B00005B36H|5.0|Very good album. I listen to it a lot.
B00005N5S5|4.0|I saw this movie about 20 years ago in a movie theater. Until this day, it is still the best science fiction and action movie I have ever seen. Arnold acting is awesome. He really looks like cyborg in this movie. Terminator has a very good story, not just blowing up stuff like many of the Hollywood movies these days. <BR>After 20 years, I saw this movie again in DVD. The DVD features are very good. The original movie was in mono. The DVD convert it to dolby digital stereo, but it gives you the option to watch in its original mono if you want. There are also some deleted scenes, several version of the script, from the original one to the final script used for the movie. There are two behind the scenes feature which contain interview with the actors, director, producer and the special effect team. The only thing missing in the DVD is the director commentary, which is why I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5.
B000084T18|4.0|rapper 50 cent startled me with this fine piece of hip hop with good and catchy beats. Many songs are great, but some lack interest or purpose.

0446678430|5.0|I have to agree with the review that precedes mine indicating that it is not possible to get rich easier than ever before. The speed at which people like Michael Dell and Steve Chase have become billionaires is incredible. But keep in mind that these two gentlemen made their fortunes over a decade ago...it's even easier today.<br />What I like about book like Retire Young Retire Rich is that it blows past self induced limitations about wealth or even the ability to retire. If you follow conventional methods, you'll be lucky to retire at all.<br />Retire Young Retire Rich is must reading for anyone who wants to create wealth early and quick enough to enjoy it. Some parts are similiar to his other books and other parts are completely new.<br />Interesting how many unhelpful votes that CPA who wrote a very nice review  here is getting (presumably from 1 star reviewers) Isn't it funny how some people have nothing better to do with their but attack successful people like Robert Kiyosaki who so kindly and humbly want to help the rest of us, discredit the guy and when someone of note comes along, they blitz that person with so many unhelpful votes? If you ask me, I think their actions are driving more people towards Kiyosaki, not away. Book sales are increasing not decreasing. And more and more people are becoming more successful than ever before.<br />This is an excellent book for anyone who wants to get rich quicker in todays world.
B00002MZ2C|5.0|I like this album very much. But is not my favorite album.
B0001Z2RUK|5.0|One of the best albums ive heard in too long, worth every cent
1400079179|1.0|So this is The Da Vinci Code?? This is the book that has caused a media frenzy? Well, the writing is above average but nothing extaordinay and the pace is at times preposterous. If not for the claim of presenting a new Christian history, it would be a fairly entertaining whodunnit. With that claim, it is a fairly entertaining whodunnit serving as propaganda for yet another anti-Christian pop conspiracy theory devoid of truth. All in all it is much ado about not much.<br /><br />And what of Brown's claim to historical accuracy? That is, after all, what the fuss is about. So he takes a theory about Jesus' alleged bloodline from a long discredited book (Holy Blood, Holy Grail) whose major evidence rested on the fake documents whose \\"discoverer\\" admitted the hoax ages ago and he combines that with Gnostic texts (that do not even state what he claims) written centuries after the canonical gospels in his attempt to rewrite Church history. In the process, he displays such blatant ignorance of the period of Constantine and the Council of Nicea one is left to wonder wonders whether in his \\"research\\" he ever managed to get anything right. The sources he cites as \\"proof\\" are largely a collection of crackpot conspiracy theorists no serious scholar gives credence along with some peripheral evidence from more reputable sources that has no bearing on his thesis. It's a fairly telling verdict when the source of your evidence undermines your own credibility.<br /><br />While Brown may be completely ignorant of history, the same cannot be said for his skill at manipulating the media. While I do so enjoy watching the fourth estate make total fools of themselves, I would enjoy it even more if he would confess the whole thing to be a practical joke engineered to demonstate how gullible our culture has become. Alas, thus far he still claims to believe the hogwash he is promoting.<br /><br />Of course, his backers often counter that it's only fiction. Excuses are the last refuge of the duped. Since when has fiction become culturally neutral? This book was written to promote a particular version of the Christian story more to the liking of someone who wishes Jesus was other than who the New Testament texts claim. Fiction often has an ulterior motive. Would one deny that The Grapes of Wrath, Uncle Tom's Cabin, and Atlas Shrugged were written with the idea of promoting a particular view of an issue? Or were they \\"just fiction\\" too?<br /><br />Twenty years from now, the same folks who are mesmerized by The Da Vinci Code will likely sincker at them as we all do now at Chariots of the Gods?, and The Bermuda Triangle. By then, they will have moved on to a different brand of snakeoil. It is rather sad when real scholars have to waste books debunking such nonsense, but it was the same with the others. Their efforts are certainly more than it deserves.ped. Since when has fiction become culturally neutral?

0446677450|5.0|What I really like about Robert Kiyosaki is that he is tuned in to all to all types of opportunities. While  he did not make his money in MLM (he made it in real estate and business) he endorses MLM and has even cut a tape called &quot;The Perfect Business.&quot;<br />I can also understand and appreciate the people who are not happy with MLM. I tried it once and it didn't work for me either. My upline provided no training and went around loading people with herbal vitamins and weight loss products one weeks, water filters the next, this and that the following week...well you get the picture. I have been told that he was the exception not the rules but it still left a bad taste in my mouth. The only reason that I have a moderate interest in MLM is  because Kiyosaki recommends it as &quot;The Perfect Business.&quot; So who knows, I may try again. As in real estate you have the power of leverage and you can start with little or no money down (providing you don't run into my old sponsor)<br />Like Kiyosaki, my main income generator is real estate. No upline, downline, sideline or byline. No sales quotas. No volume requirements. Like MLM, it's not get rich quick, but it is get rich for sure.<br />In Rich Dad Poor Dad Kiyosaki teaches the philosophy that his rich dad taught him. In that regard, Kiyosaki is one of the only wealthly businesspeople willing to share and I tahnk him for that.
B00000099Y|5.0|I listen to it every day to help keep me strong. Its my favorite one.
B00009RAJH|3.0|Looks like I spoke too soon when I wrote my last review; after listening to this CD more thoroughly, I actually found that most tracks sounded better on the original CD, rather than this remaster. Yes, &quot;Blue Letter&quot;, &quot;Crystal&quot;, &quot;Say You Love Me&quot;, &quot;Landslide&quot; and &quot;World Turning&quot; sound better on this remaster, but everything else sounds worse - often clearly worse (&quot;Warm Ways&quot; in particular sounds disappointingly dull and flat).<br />I was shocked to find that the stereo image on &quot;Sugar Daddy&quot; and &quot;I'm So Afraid&quot; wondered all over the place. This wasn't the case on the original, and is something you wouldn't expect to hear on even the crappiest CD. It shows that no care was taken with this remaster - the better sounding tracks are probably just a fluke.<br />I am simply amazed that anyone involved could have let such a shoddy remastering of such a well-known album be released.
0783229526|5.0|The movie is downright funny I tell you. It shouldn't be -  watching two maniacs descend into chaos, you'd think that's disurbing...should be disturbing, but it's NOT. It's funny. Property damage, buffoonery...that's what the 60's were.. really. You should be pleased as punch not to care about these characters. We don't want to be them, to empathize with them. Watching this is like going to zoo...see the monkeys do some sick stuff. If you don't laugh out loud to this movie you've lost your soul.
B00005JMUA|5.0|Okay, first to the person who said that a great filmmaker would have told the movie in order, told the main character's name, not show the wedding scene, not use bad music etc., let me educate you:<BR>A typical filmmaker would have told the movie in order.<BR>A typical filmmaker would have told us the character's name right off the bat.<BR>A typical filmmaker would have put in unoriginal, crappy pop music.<BR>A typical filmmaker would try to be original and not put in the wedding scene to try to make you use your imagination.<br />Quentin Tarantino is obviously NOT your typical filmmaker and I find his movies to be fresh and original takes on common themes and plots. There are revenge flicks a-plenty, told the same way, with the same type of character, same reasons, etc. QT took that and molded it to his own vision with Uma Thurman (one of her top performances), Michael Madsen, Daryl Hannah, and all in mind the whole time he wrote this movie. QT writes his screenplays around the music because that's already in mind as well. In fact, he would scrap a scene if he couldn't get the rights to the song he wants to go with the scene. You can tell too. Who else can make an Ennio Morricone spaghetti western song go along with a samurai movie scene? Using old music was part of the homage (especially using Morricone and Meiko Kaji (see Death Rides a Horse and Lady Snowblood)).<br />About the wedding scene, while I would have liked to see the DiVAS beat The Bride to the ground, QT pulled away at the exact moment to make you use your imagination, but still gives you an idea of what went on in there (using one of his trademark camera shots, by the way).<br />Telling the movie out of order works brilliantly and causes a mix of foreboding and hindsight. The chapter thing was a nice touch as well. <br />Not telling the character's name was a way to show the dimensions of the character. In the first Volume, The Bride is a nameless killing machine, without mercy, compassion, forgiveness, and conscience. In the second movie, she's a woman, a fighter, still a killer, a mother, a lover, with a name. She's more fleshed out, more three dimensional.<br />This movie was a refreshing break from the dull and unoriginal. I loved it and I appreciate it for what it is on its own and not compare it to anything else because it far surpasses anything else. As it is said in Volume Two, \\"You don't compare a Hanzo sword to another sword except with another Hanzo sword.\\" You don't compare a Quentin Tarantino movie with another movie except another QT movie.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Very good album. I like the way it sounds.
B00009RAJJ|3.0|I'm a huge Mac fan, and this is my favourite Mac album. Furthermore, &quot;Sara&quot; (along with &quot;Landslide&quot;) is my favourite Mac song, so I was always frustrated by the fact that the original CD had an edited version. So naturally I was very excited when I bought this CD, with the full-length version of &quot;Sara&quot;.<br />However, I was soon dispappointed by the fact that the sound quality of this remaster - like the other two Mac remasters - was actually inferior to the original! I have to say that in the case of this CD (unlike the other two), the original sounded so good that it was hard to imagine how it could be better. But I wasn't expecting it to sound worse! As with the Rumours remaster (see my review), the previous pressing sounds significantly crisper and clearer.<br />I guess I have to be happy with the full-length version of &quot;Sara&quot; on &quot;The Chain&quot; box set (the version of &quot;Silver Springs&quot; from the box set also sounds vastly superior to the one on the remastered &quot;Rumours&quot;). What's it going to take to have definitive remasters of these classic albums? Mobile Fidelity, DCC, are you listening?
1594200106|5.0|This is the best book I have ever read!  I would even read it again (I never want to do a book twice).  I was really impressed that it had been translated -  This book has everything -<br />well written (a gift with words), suspenseful, characters you can relate to, scenes that become real....Some phrases I had to<br />copy and think about.  Couldn't put it down and sad to see it end.
B000002UAX|5.0|If I remember correctly, this was The Beatles' transitional album, which was meant to get them back to mainstream music.  Something went terribly wrong (or right), and we got this instead.  While it's not as good as some of their later stuff, like Sgt. Pepper, it's still fantastic.  The only thing that disappointed me was the missing Revolution (fast), but that was my own dumb fault; I just assumed Rev 9 was it.
B000069HK2|4.0|I think this is a great cd. I don't understand why the people that give it a bad rating think there is someomthing wrong with anyone who doesn't share their musical tastes. I wouldn't have even looked at this CD if it wasn't for the fact that the majority of hard rock music out right now is terrible and therefore has kept me searching. I don't get why someone else is a &quot;retard&quot; for liking any type of music. Is someone who likes hamburgers a &quot;retard&quot; to someone who doesn't? no. its all about personal preference. its what the people who are complaining about fabricated bands are complaining about - they want people to be &quot;different&quot; even though different means having the same opinion as them. anyways, great cd. box full of sharp objects is one of my favorites. I dont give it 5 because no album is absolutely perfect on every song.
B00009RAJI|3.0|As a huge Mac fan, I purchased the three remastered Mac albums with great excitement. However, my excitement soon turned to grave disappointment when I listened to them. I should point out that there were two earlier pressings of this CD; the first was dreadful, and this version is clearly better than that one. However, the second version (done as a result of customer complaints about the first, I believe) was vastly superior, both to the first pressing and (to a lesser extent) this remaster.      &quot;Second Hand News&quot; sounds much better on the remaster, but it's all downhill from there. &quot;Dreams&quot; is lineball, but from then on it's clear that the second pressing was significantly crisper and clearer than this remaster (although the remaster has fuller bass). Also, &quot;Silver Springs&quot; sounds infinitely better on &quot;The Chain&quot; box set.      I am frankly astonished that anyone involved could have let such a substandard remaster of such a well-known album be released.
B00004R9A4|4.0|Made during the Disney wilderness years following Walt's death, Bedknobs is a re-tread of the hugely successful Mary Poppins. However, if you're going to re-tread a film, it might as well be a classic! Check off the ingredients: - initially cold matronly female lead who the children and audience quickly warms to, capable and charming child leads, a perky male side-kick, an animated/live action interlude that has nothing to do with the plot, a Sherman brothers score, an episodic structure, a general magical story-book quality to the film etc.<BR>Angela Lansbury gives her most likable screen characterisation (apart from perhaps Jessica Fletcher!) and shows to those not familiar with her Broadway career that she can sing and dance. David Tomlinson brushes off the stuffy ghost of Poppins' George Banks and plays a buffoon with great relish. The children are all well cast and shine in slightly cliched and under-written roles. Special mention must go to Roddy McDowell for a lovely cameo as a scheming cleric and to British-favourite Bruce Forsyth as a flick-knife toting 'spiv'.<BR>The animated sequence involving the 'Beautiful Briney' is wonderful and, once the characters reach dry land, the soccer game with the animals is as 'Looney Tunes' as Disney would probably dare be! The rest of the film is slightly slow in places but has some excellent set-pieces, in particular the Portabello Road musical interlude, the clothing being 'magic-ed' to life and the final 'Armour vs. Nazis' showdown. The special effects are very good for the age, especially the animated object scenes. The score, by the Shermans, isn't a patch on their Mary Poppins but includes some real gems including the afore-mentioned 'Beautiful Briney' and 'Portabello Road' as well as the catchy 'Substituciary Locomotion'.<BR>This edition includes around fifteen minutes of previously cut scenes and lines of dialogue that have been re-inserted into the main body of the film. Unfortunatly, the audio from these clips has been lost, and so the lines had to be re-recorded with varying degrees of success. Lansbury and McDowell have supplied their own voices but Tomlinson's, the children's and Tessy O'Shea's have been 'impersonated' quite poorly, meaning that those with relatively keen ears can tell when a newly inserted scene is playing. The audio for the songs survived, meaning that 'Eglantine' and 'Portabello Road' have been extended, although some of the film quality in the latter also draws attention to the cut scenes. These quibbles do not, however, spoil the film and the re-inserted scenes at least clarify McDowell's character's intensions towards Miss Price. Prior to this edition, we were not aware that he was wanting to marry her for her 'nice, sturdy house' - which is why he is jumping up and down on her porch when she answers the door to him!<BR>Overall, this is a film that plays well to all ages (I loved it as a child and now sit and watch it often with my son). It's unfortunate that it will forever live in Mary Poppins' substantial shadow (along with the weaker Pete's Dragon), but at least it lives as one of the better Disney films made in those wilderness years prior to The Little Mermaid'.<BR>Thouroughly recommended.
0064471837|5.0|This book is absoulutly amazing. It is so well written, it just takes you away. You can't help but love the characters in this book and you can't help but root them on. I constantly found myself lost in this book that i would feel like the character herself. If you are a lover of fantasy and adventure you'll absoultly fall in love with this book. And if you read this one you must read the final two. Happy reading!
B00005JMYG|2.0|The 70's satire is a nice try, but the jokes are overdone, and the end product just falls flat.  The \\"boy's club\\" mantality of the all-male anchor desk is done in humor that would make a 12 year old boy proud, and never really gets beyond it.  There is little plot, instead relying on a series of sight gags and weird plot devices (like a gang rumble between the guys from every anchor desk in San Diego).  The best line in the whole movie was at the very end when the narrator gave the \\"this is where they are now\\" speech.  Brick, the 50 I.Q. weather man was a top advisor in the Bush Administration.  It was the best line in the whole movie.
B00005JNA2|5.0|Like every other fan of Richard Linklater's \\"Before Sunrise,\\" I indulged in a great deal of pleasurable speculation whether Celine and Jesse actually reunited in Vienna six months to the day after meeting there, and I wasn't particularly anxious for Linklater to answer that question definitively. Therefore, I was overjoyed to see that in the sequel, \\"Before Sunset,\\" Linklater provides an answer that is not only satisfying, but actually improves on the original. The new film is set nine years later in Paris, where Celine (Julie Delpy)  attends Jesse's (Ethan Hawke) book-signing for his novel based on that fateful night in Vienna. (Note: the years have been much kinder to Delpy than to Hawke; she looks gorgeous, he looks haggard.) With scarcely a beat, they resume their long-interrupted conversation about love and life, filling each other in about what they've been doing since they saw each other last. Set in real time as Celine and Jesse take a  walk through Paris, the conversation (improvised by Hawke and Delpy on a framework provided by Linklater) builds quietly to overwhelming rushes of emotion, and ends on an ambiguous note that some viewers might find unsatisfying but I found abundantly believable and hopeful. Linklater, Hawke and Delpy keep the movie flowing gracefully, and Lee Daniel's glowing photography of Paris provides the perfect touch for a movie that appeals to the romantic in us all.

B00003CX9E|5.0|Can you imagine what the perception of RKO was at the time they made this decision? Let's see, how about we give complete control of a major film to a twenty five year old radio voice with zero film experience (whose claim to fame was scaring the life out of the public with a fake story about aliens landing on earth) and even better, let him staff the movie with actors who have little to no screen experience. On top of that, we'll let it become one of the most controversial pictures of its time because it mirrors the life of one of the biggest names in America today. Why, it may never be able to be released because of the lawsuits-- Great idea!<br />I have just described Citizen Kane. All of the above is true, which makes the fact that it is possibly the greatest film in American Film History even more amazing. Everything is perfect. The script (which Welles co-wrote), the actors (all relative unknowns except Welles and Joseph Cotton), the special effects (listen to Roger Ebert's Commentary on this special edition for details) and finally, the makeup-- You won't believe how great a job they do making 25 year old Welles look 60.<br />As for the story, it's done in a most interesting fashion. Charles Foster Kane (Welles) dies at the very beginning of the movie and utters his famous last word &quot;Rosebud&quot;. A reporter is given the task of finding out just what that one word meant. So he goes and interviews all the people who knew Kane to try to learn the meaning of the word. In the process, we are shown Kane through the eyes of those who knew him. We never see Kane through his own eyes, always what his former associates saw.<br />This is interesting, because Kane is a tragic figure as seen by just about everyone. He is unhappy and lonely. We as an audience eventually learn the meaning of Rosebud. I have read reviews that complain that the movie is about this one thing (I won't reveal what it is). But long before we learn the identity of Rosebud, the film has madeits point. What is the point? My opinion is that the film shows us basically the worthlessness and despair of materialism. Loving &quot;stuff&quot; or money will ultimately lead to unhappiness.<br />By the way, this movie almost was never seen. The man I spoke of at the beginning of the review is William Randolph Hearst, former newspaper magnate. He saw too much of himself in the film and sued to squash it. Fortunately he lost. The second disc in the set is a two hour documentary on this topic. It is also excellent and well worth a viewing.<br />One last thing. Although this movie has been ranked on the AFI list as number one American movie of all time, it did NOT win Best Picture in 1941. That film? &quot;How Green was my Valley&quot;
B00005JMYG|4.0|This whole movie seems deceptively simple.  Will Ferrell plays Ron Burgundy, a San Diego anchorman, who is a local celebrity and a god among men for simply reading a teleprompter and having intensely primped hair.  When Christina Applegate's character moves into the station and by a freak accident becomes his co-anchor conflict arises, as being an anchor man is a man's job to Burgundy.  Applegate's rise starts liberate the women in the office and make changes for Burgundy's sex driven, macho, misogynist character.  So, the plot seems pretty cliched and obvious, but the movie takes formulas and makes them explode.<br />Somehow, Ferrell takes jokes that would seem banal and stupid and adds the right tinge of irony and clever characterization to turn create an excellent comedic performance.  Also, the movie itself takes basic movie cliches and heightens them to such a level or ridiculousness that it's difficult not to laugh.  For instance, in one scene, Paul Rudd's character tries to seduce Applegate by using the right cologne.  A secret bookshelf compartment opens up and he applies \\"Panther\\" cologne to his neck.  Ferrell warns him that he smells like gasoline but Rudd insists that in fact \\"It works on women at least 2/3 of the time, all the time.\\"  Rudd goes into the office and someone complains that it smells like \\"A baby's diaper filled with Indian food.\\"  Another cries that \\"Something smells like bigfoot's (...).\\"  The fire alarm goes off....well you get the idea.<br />Another scene involves a rumble between the local news stations over their masculine pride and ratings.  At first it looks like a fist fight will start, but suddenly grenades appear, the PBS station becomes involved, medieval weapons are drawn, and celebrity cameos from Tim Robbins, Luke Wilson, Ben Stiller, and Vince Vaughn are featured.  <br />The film takes these stock moments, in these cases macho male courtship and rivalries and exagerrate them to the highest degree of silliness.  They're so funny while you're watching them that you're able to forgive that the film itself is not that sophisticated and that some of the jokes collapse horribly.  <br />Anchorman isn't exactly a sophisticated social critique or the most intellectual comedy, but somehow it manages to achieve comedic effects in an unusual and interesting way.  When it comes down to it, just thinking of the film makes me laugh a bit, and it's hard to find fault with that.
B0001BS4Q0|4.0|There are a few songs on this album that I absolutely love, the rest I tend to skip.  The songs I listen to over and over are breathe me, rewrite, numb and my favourite is sweet potato.  I love the lyrics in sweet potato, they are so easy to connect with. Maybe just a reflection of where I'm at, but these songs just seem to tap into the ups and downs of love - well mostly the downs, the disappointments.  Her voice is calming and the lyrics conducive to reflection.  I'd recommend buying the album just for these few songs.
B00000K19E|4.0|Reflecting back on the enormous popular and critical success of 'The Matrix', it is refreshing to note that people were overwhelmingly drawn to a film that conformed itself neither to the cynical and pessimistic bent that informs many recent movies nor to an easy and clichd sort of optimism. The quest for truth is not mocked but strongly valorized here. This film is especially interesting for the numerous clues it gives about how spirituality is envisioned in the modern, technological world: organized groups and systems of all kinds (social, religious, political...) are discarded in favour of a more individualistic, master-disciple type of spiritual experience; at the same time, the notion of an official church is replaced by secret fraternities. This disregard for dogmas entails an eclectic approach that welcomes elements of Eastern thought (especially Buddhism and Taoism), of Hellenism and of Christianity; the path towards enlightenment is the Way, or Tao, which can't be put into words but must be lived. Neo's ongoing initiation features recurrent death-resurrection motifs - it does get caught up in a few noisy and overdone action scenes, but it remains fascinating from beginning to end. And the movie works well as an introduction to philosophy...
B00007LTIA|4.0|Most progressive-rock bands have that one sweeping, 20-minute epic somewhere on one of their albums. Pink Floyd have &quot;Echoes,&quot; Genesis have &quot;Supper's Ready,&quot; &amp; The Alan Parsons Project have &quot;The Fall Of The House Of Usher,&quot; just to name a few. But talk about guts---on &quot;Tales From Topographic Oceans,&quot; Yes do FOUR 20-minute songs! And if that weren't enough, the album is a conceptual piece---and a religious one, no less---with all four pieces being based upon the Shastric scriptures that singer Jon Anderson was reading at the time. The vague lyrics will keep your brain doing loop-de-loops for days, and the first couple of listens to &quot;Topographic&quot; may be a bit trying (the very first time *I* ever played &quot;Topographic,&quot; I actually found myself checking my watch---I've NEVER done that with any other album that I own). And yet, if you can give this album enough attention over time---and allow it to gracefully age in your music collection like a fine wine---you'll find that &quot;Tales From Topographic Oceans&quot; is, in the end, a darn good Yes album. Okay, so the album IS flawed: listening to it now, 15 years or so after I initially bought it, I still think &quot;Topographic&quot; has a very long-winded middle section with &quot;The Remembering&quot; &amp; &quot;The Ancient.&quot; On their own, both 20-minute pieces are very good, but sandwiched between two OTHER 20-minute pieces (that just so happen to be musically stronger, besides), these two compositions still make for strenuous listening. My advice---listen to &quot;The Remembering&quot; &amp; &quot;The Ancient&quot; by themselves, individually, rather than in a marathon playing of the album from end-to-end. But what &quot;Topographic&quot; really has going for it is first-rate musicianship throughout from Anderson &amp; company, and a *superb* beginning and end. The opener, &quot;The Revealing Science Of God,&quot; is easily one of Yes' greatest masterpieces---a soaring, memorable epic, beautifully performed by the band and definitely making the most lasting impression of the album's four pieces. And the final piece on the album, &quot;Ritual,&quot; is another winner, with the band finishing this mammoth album in sweeping, powerful style---it's an album-closer that definitely sticks with you. Oh, if only Yes had done a single album with just &quot;Revealing Science&quot; &amp; &quot;Ritual&quot;....they would've hit a home run. But hey, getting to third base ain't bad, either. For better or worse, you gotta admire Yes for creating an album that no other prog-rock band would even DARE to attempt. Despite being bloated, &quot;Tales From Topographic Oceans&quot; ultimately hangs together because of it's musical strengths, i.e. the Good Stuff contained on it. The musical journey that Yes take the listener on with &quot;Topographic&quot; is a little bit bumpy, but hang in there---it's worth it.pieces---a soaring, memorable epic, beautifully performed by the band and definitely making the most lasting impression of the album's four pieces.

B0000B3B95|1.0|this has to be the stupidest, most boring movie i have ever seen! i tried to fall asleep in the theater but that was kind of impossible through all of the hulks idiotic roaring. half of this movie is just the hulk galloping and bouncing around the desert.
B00005JMFQ|4.0|My husband and I watched this together, and we both enjoyed it immensely. Wonderful feel good movie with just the right amount of comedy to keep it light.  All of the actors in the cast were brilliant.  Throughly enjoyable film.
B00025ETIW|4.0|In all honesty, the new MYC cd is very, very good.  In comparing it with their previous release, &quot;I brought you bullets, you brought me love,&quot; I would argue that while both releases are great for different reasons, &quot;Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge&quot; might appeal to a broader fan base because of it's slightly more punk-pop songs.<br />With their first release, what you heard was a raw, emotional sound that was very near hardcore/emocore.  I loved their first album and still lose myself on tracks like &quot;Demolition Lovers&quot; and &quot;Cubicles&quot;.  The sound is just a little less catchy and harder.<br />However, with Three Cheers, a much more evolved MYC displays a steady continuance of melodic power punk.  Gerard Way soars with the same emotion and rawness that made the first release great, but the overall sound behind him sustains a much more poppier sound that moves in a far quicker pace than it's predecessor.<br />I'm not going to rate every song (even though I appreciate the reviewer's who do) but I will try to evaluate on content.  For those who don't know, the album has a distinct concept: It's a love story that centers around man and woman that are both dead, and can be together provided the man completes the devil's work of killing a thousand evil men.  If that's not creative, I don't know what is.  Every single song tells a piece of the story, and as a listener, you must put the pieces together.  I also heard Gerard was in therapy during the writing of this album...go figure...?  A lot of people have previously docked MYC as another cheesy thematic band that only focuses on vampires and what not, but I think they are finally starting to receive worthy acclaim.<br />Bottom line, if morbid stuff like tombstones and dead people is your bag, then buy the album.  Buy the album if you like good power-pop music in a severely mislead consumer society.  Buy the album if you enjoy anger fuelled music with heavy drumming and incredibly emotional and raw singing.  Lastly, buy their first release, which in my opinion, outdoes this one a little...
0553277472|2.0|Ugh.  This book can't decide what it wants to be.  Every time you get interested in a topic (and this book does contain some interesting topics from the travel narrative to some of the ideas expressed) it switches over to another topic before resolving anything.  This is incredibly frustrating from the point of view of entertainment.  Does this book want to be a novel and flow like one, or a middle-brow discussion of contemporary worldviews, or a amateur philosophy thesis?  It suceeds only in being a very long and slow 400+ pages of several seperate books thrown together with minimal integration.
B0000039QA|5.0|After owning his first album, I copped this one today at Spinnakers, and am glad I did. Biggie's music has never let me down. It pisses me off that Biggie was shot, he was the most talented rapper of the East Coast scene. If Biggie and Tupac were still alive, and if them and dre were still in the rap scene I'm sure things would be much different. We'd have new material from the most talented rappers of the 90's instead of crappy cash-ins.
0553208845|3.0|I loved HESSE more before I read this book. It is a story, just a simnple story and far away from human reality at least from my point of view. It is full of philosophical discussions about what life should be but I don't think it can be a guide for it.<br />I think that there will always be people who will like this book especially in the west, regarding the spiritual crisis expected to get serious dimensions in the following years, but not suffiecient for pragmatist people.<br />Anyway, not a very bad read.
B00005LOLD|5.0|This is Brando at his very best.  I loved this movie from beginning to end.  It is sentimental without being sappy, it is simply a great love story without any of the modern day 'scenes'.  Red Buttons is simply superb, along with James Garner.  Marlon was able to do the southern accent seemingly without any variation.  This movie was excellent from beginning to end and left me feeling extremely happy to have a copy.  The Japanese actresses fit the roles without exception.  Would recommend this movie to anyone who loves a great love story with an exceptional ending
B000002I97|5.0|I bought this LP when it was first released, and I've heard a heck of lot of John Prine tracks in the past 33 years. I still think this is his most successful album overall. His voice here is young and full of raw vigor, and his songs mix humor and tragedy in a balanced fashion. In recent years John has moved closer to traditional country material, and he does it well. This one, however, is the folk/protest/social commentary record that pretty much capped the '60's for me. If you like John's later work but have not heard this, you are missing some of his finest writing and singing.
B00005JMYG|5.0|This was the funniest movie I've ever seen. I had tears in my eyes through the entire thing from laughing so hard. This was Will Ferrell's funniest yet- he left me in a glass cage of emotion.

B0001Z52RU|4.0|i liked this movie. chaos is everywhere and is happening all the time. i've read a book on chaos theory and it is extremely interesting to me. i thought this movie used it very well. *****SPOILER WARNING***** my only complaint is at the very end, he should have talked to her instead of passing her by. this could have hinted that they finally got to be together AND he fixed things, too.

B00003CXCT|3.0|I don't see why people think Star Wars is the best epic ever.  I mean they are enjoyable movies, but nothing spectacular.  Maybe it is because I was not around when they first came out.  Maybe they are like the LotR of today, and people in 20 years will wonder what we found so great about LotR.  Not to mention I for one prefer the Prequel Trilogy.      Anyway, after owning and watching the DVD set, I must say, these are definitely the best versions you will ever see.  The video quality is just so goregous, and the 5.1 audio just makes the movies so much more enjoyable than they were the past few times I have watched them, especially the Empire Strikes Back.  The improvements do not take anything away from the movies' story, and there aren't too many.  Not to mention Lucas even said the original version were the unifinished versions.  Even having Hayden at the end of Return of the Jedi was no big deal because it makes sense, and it is only like fifteen seconds of footage.  Then you have other changes to make it fit better with the superior prequel trilogy such as Jango's voice for Boba, and it sounds a lot better.  Some people, like my dad, could not even tell what was added into the movie since he only watched them once in a while.  Also, those of you that complained about Hayden's acting in AotC should realize that none of the Skywalker's had great actors.  Luke (Hamill) and Leia (Fisher) were not that great in the acting department either, especially in the first movie.  They did improve throughout the series, but not that much.      As for the extras, well you have the Empire of Dreams 2 1/2 hour documentary that goes into a lot of details on the making of the movies, and also mentions how Lucas was not happy with the way the original movie went due to issues with Fox and his crew members.  There are also documentaries on the evolution of the characters, the success of SW, really bad trailers, a video game trailer and demo, and a few other items.      I highly recommended these you like story and space battles, but don't go in expecting the best thing ever made, because there is better out there.    I give the DVDs a 5/5 stars  A New Hope a 2.5/5  Empire Strikes Back 4/5  Return of the Jedi 3.5/5
B00006RCNW|5.0|I love this show!!!! Our friend recommended this show. I must admit, at first I had doubts about another cop show but this show is so amazing! Everytime, I wish the show would never end! The Sopranos really have a competition except this is way better because they deal with people's everyday problems and gets to the root of things. The SUPER COPS are crooked as a politician but you gotta love the way they handle things. No matter what they do, you just can't hate them. It's too much drama but it's the dramas they have that makes the show so awesome! This is a MUSTTTTTT SEEEEEE especially if you like action!
B0001UL7RY|5.0|No matter how much people complain about Avril Lavigne, my opinion will never change.  I love her music, and she's proven that to me once again.  Thanks very much Avril, awesome stuff.
6301763041|4.0|This movie is so bad it hurts.  It's incredibly campy and silly, a wonderful parody.  I'd say a definate must for Johnny Depp fans (and I can't say I'm one of them) and for anyone who enjoys a good laugh at stupidly silly films.  No smart comedy hear, no deep message or meaning, just a hilarious spoof filled with catchy songs and dance moves.  A good rainy day film, or for cheering you up, though I think if you were really in a bad mood this movie would just seem stupid and make you want to scream.  Still, not bad when you want a laugh.  I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone looking for witty comedy or a serious or engaging film, just someone ready for a silly and over-the-top movie filled with song and dance and tons of unbelievabley stereotyped fun characters.<br />4-stars for a quirky and silly movie.  Nothing extrodinary, but still fun!
B0001UL7RY|5.0|No matter how much all of the OH SO PUNXERZ kids complain about how much Avril Lavigne has ruined music, I will always love and listen to it.  Once again, Avril has shown me why I listened to Let Go 10 times a day.  Under My Skin will never stop playing at my house, and I believe it will outsell Let Go...not that sales really matter, I just personally think it's a better record than Let Go.  She's matured so much.  Thanks very much Avril, awesome stuff.
B000148KK2|1.0|It's just amazing to me how  the jazz industry  is so out of it that it promotes a flat and lifeless singer like Ms. Krall but   disregards really great talent like Dena DeRose and Carmen Lundy, unknown and  underrated, unappreciated unhyped,!  If you are really interested in great jazz singing check out the amazing   &quot;Something To Believe In&quot; by Carmen Lundy, and &quot;Love's Holiday&quot; by Dena DeRose These will both spin you around and show you what great singing  is about. In concert Dena DeRose totally knocked me out. Her playing is as serious as it gets, and she sings beautifully. On occasion she gets into scatting unison lines with her right hand, or she'll sing different melodic textures against her chordal voicings. Very hip stuff.
B000069HK2|5.0|I love this album, thanks for helping us all through hard times guys.  Awesome stuff.
B00000G3PA|2.0|I enjoy most Jerry Bruckheimer movies. There almost always just plain fun, like &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot; or &quot;The Rock.&quot; I somehow missed &quot;Armageddon&quot; in the theaters, so I rented it as soon as I could.<br />Despite all the popularity it got, I wasn't dazzled by it like so many others. The story is about a gigantic asteroid racing towards earth. If it hit, every human on the planet would die. So the U.S. government, led by a NASA administrator (Billy Bob Thornton) hire an oil-drilling team to take a space shuttle out into space, land on the asteroid, and blow it up with a nuclear bomb. Easy, right? The team is led by a guy named Harry (Bruce Willis), and includes such actors as Ben Affleck, Owen Wilson, Steve Buscemi, Will Patton, and Michael Clarke Duncan. Then we get assaulted with Bruckheimer/Bay's trademark action sequences: loud and mesmerizing.<br />Except that in &quot;Armageddon,&quot; I didn't buy any of the action. The special effects, which were awesome in some parts, were horrible looking in others. Willis' and Affleck's performances were awful; most of them were. I realize that a mindless blockbuster like this one doesn't matter if the acting is bad, but it was so bad here that I just couldn't take it. Actually, the best performances came from Owen Wilson (who died in the middle) and Peter Stormare as a Russian cosmonaut. I also thought that when Willis sacrificed himself, all those shots of his daughter (Liv Tyler) were unnessecary. Too much gloss for me.<br />No, this movie isn't very good. &quot;The Rock&quot; was just so much better. Heck, I even enjoyed &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; more.
B00008EYA5|2.0|SWAT is an action movie that just felt uninspired, unoriginal and lacking in more areas than I could possibly account in this review. This is just one of those movies you watch and someone asks you what you though and you respond &quot;eh, it was ok&quot; and cannot even bring yourself to say anything else. If you're bored and just want a movie to pick up from the video store SWAT will do you just fine... especially if it's one of those days you will spend more time talking than paying attention to the movie, and if you happen to come across it while flipping channels then it might make a decent distraction from your boredome, but I dont know why anyone would pay money to own a copy of this movie. Im very sorry I went to the theater to see this.<br /> Samuel L jackson, and your average run of the mill action sequences are the only things that will keep you from completely disliking this movie. You probably wont hate swat enough to bad mouth it to everyone you know, but then again after you've seen it you will probably never ever think of it ever again... ever. <br />Swat epitimizes the word mediocre.

Linkin Park is NOT metal you handi-tards, it's POP music.  The lead singer sucks at screaming, and the guitarist sucks at rapping.  The riffs are boring and simple.  Everything about this band sucks.  Linkin Park sold out before they even started.  I wish I could give it a zero.
B00028HBKC|5.0|Even if you are not a religious person, this is one of the emotional experiences you will ever recieve from a film. The story of christ is portrayed so vividly and savagely than anyone with a soul can see past this film as just another commercial film with no integrity. The scenes of christs suffering and execution as an innocent man will make anyone think twice of their own existence and the life theyve lead. Hopefully all of us can take a little piece of the christ with us because of this film
B00005JMEW|1.0|Imagine Quentin Tarantino, a well known hollywod producer, gets tired of making original movies. Most of his movies ( Pulp Fiction, Dusk Til Dawn1,2,3 etc.) are entertaining, but have been done before or at least have a totally familiar theme. Well now, Quentin just decided to lower the bar even farther. Take B-grade kung fu movies, B-grade western movies, Japanese Animation movies, and steal the most famous scenes out of them. Then throw in tons of people getting killed. You might think this would equal action, but no, it gets old in two minutes. Both volume 1 and 2 are horrible. I tried to like these movies, but I don't understand how anyone could be entertained from this. Wait a minute! I know what it is! The best part in this series is playing name that scene! It's like a trivia book of other people's ideas!<BR>Don't bother

0790731452|5.0|When I first heard that Tim Burton was going to turn the Mars Attacks trading cards into a movie I couldn't imagine how he could adapt them for the big screen for under 100 million, but when I saw it I said to myself, &quot;FINALLY! Some has found a good use for CGI!&quot; This very funny sci-fi comedy is destined to become a classic and is one of the most imaginatively produced films in ages. Featuring tons of great cameos by stars - particularly Jack Nicholson, who plays a dual role and Tom Jones - Mars Attacks also boasts a great score, lots of wild, funny action and, yes.... LOTS OF GREAT DEATH SCENES! Yes, folks, it is DAMN FUNNY when people get killed; heck, SLAUGHTERED, in this film! Yep, death CAN be funny, especially when it happens to movie stars who are all so obviously movie stars in a fantasy movie. I only wish they could have killed a &quot;better&quot; class of movie ACKters, the ones you WANT to see die, like Will Smith, Bruce Willis, Steven Segal, Arn-OLD, Julia Roberts, any model turned actress and virtually EVERY movie star who came to prominence from the time this film was released until NOW (and beyond, it seems). With today's atmosphere, where the world over, especially here in the U.S., people are so insanely and blindly freaful of a coming apocalypse, it's always good to bring it all out on screen, particularly when it's done in such an over-the-top fashion as this. I wouldn't be surprised to see this film become a big hit it it were re-released to theatres today (HEY, ANYONE OUT THERE REMEMBER ANOTHER LITTLE CLASSIC BY THE NAME OF DR. STRANGELOVE, WHICH CAME OUT DURING THE HEIGHT OF THE COLD WAR AND IN WHICH THE ENTIRE EARH WAS DEVASTATED IN THE END????!!!!) Sheesh, some &quot;people&quot;!
B00023B1LC|1.0|There is nothing special about this DVD release even though I think the movie was great.  They just used the deleted scenes from the first DVD release for this one.  Anyway, I read the second book and the third book from the series.  Even though I only saw the previews of Bourne Supremacy, it seems the screwed up the whole plot line in the second movie.  According to the book the whole movie (about 80% of it) suppose to take place in the China region, cause CIA kidnapped Bourne's wife.  I think they should have stuck to the books plot instead of the damn eye candy plot they decided on in this upcoming movie. So, I am sure they will screw up the third movie as well.  I am still going to see it since I am a fan and to see how much difference there is between the book plot and the movie.  Anyway, nobody should buy this DVD, its the company's way of getting you to buy another DVD not needed.  Save  your money and buy the DVD of Bourne Supremacy when it comes out in few months. For all the die hard Bourne Fans, I recommend reading the books of Bourne Supremacy and Ultimatum.
0780622553|4.0|Imagine a city that is always dark, that lives in eternal night. Imagine its inhabitants that are human beings whose memories have been erased and replaced by some borrowed recollections from other human beings, hence artificial. Imagine that city is being built and rebuilt every-« day » in that eternal night at what corresponds to midnight when everything stops, everyone goes to sleep and forgets everything to regain when waking up a newly arranged consciousness in a newly arranged environment that has been reorganized following the dreams or recollections of some human beings that are not even in this city.<br /><br />Imagine that all this is done by some extraterrestrial species that is testing the human race to see how they live and react. Then this city is nothing but a bubble in the middle of cosmic emptiness. The discovery of the extraterrestrials is that some humans can resist this process and then they stick to some dream of sunlight, a beach, the ocean, etc.<br /><br />And this dream will lead these human beings into breaking the bubble to go beyond this selfcontained city. That's the film. It is interesting but it remains rather superficial : a real human being always wants to escape a limited space or time that is imposed onto him or her.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU
B0001Z37HM|3.0|Arnold.<br />He is the reason this is watchable and without him this would be one of the worst movies ever.<br />Nielson has the acting talent of a cherry tree but plays the role well physically. The biggest joke of a scene was Bridgette mourning her dead sister. A true Oscar worthy performance!<br />And young Prince Tarn... ugh!!!<br />He is the reason this movie is 3 stars and not 5.<br />He is easily one of the most annoying characters to ever grace the silver screen and his servant, who has an IQ of a turnip, is almost as bad. His sidekick is not funny, overweight, and uses a giant bone for a weapon. Wow what a great mix!<br />This movie is enjoyable, but only if you were a young male growing up in the 80's and for nostalgic purposes. Without Arnold this would be unwatchable.
052594527X|5.0|This book is very well written, and combines both fact and fiction. It provides insight into the house of the master painter Johannes Vermeer. Tracy Chevalier is a great writer, and the movie is as good if not better than the book. (P.S she gets to slap cornelia at the end! HE He!!!)
B00005Y7GQ|5.0|While I like to think of myself as an internationalist when it comes to watching films, I had never heard of Stephen Chow before deciding to take a chance on 'Shaolin Soccer.'<br />Shame on me. Chow turns out to be a hilarious and creative star. Who could have dreamed of something as goofy, infectious and, at the same time, as technically brilliant (the special effects are eye-popping) as Shaolin Soccer? Now, I'm reading through the comments left here by Mr. Chow's longtime fans and I realize I'm going to have to check out some of his \\"better works\\" (as judged by these aficionados) like 'God of Cookery' and 'From Beijing with Love'.<br />Not knowing what to expect from Shaolin Soccer, I found myself delightfully convulsed with laughter at two early points in the film:<br />- An impromptu synchronized 'street' rendition of the Kool and the Gang hit 'Celebration.' This is almost impossible to explain. When it took shape in the movie, I literally mouthed the words \\"What the...?\\" Truly inspired.<br />- A second muscial number, in which two of the Shaolin 'brothers' take to the stage in an ill-fated cabaret act. While I'm sure this was even funnier in Cantonese, even the wonderfully descriptive subtitles demonstrated the amateur campiness of their performance (which was exactly Chow's point).<br />Plus, for any soccer/football fan the depictions of the in-game events are a joy. All in all, Shaolin Soccer was a unexpected treat.
0060012218|5.0|\\"I was deep behind enemy lines, in the very heart of the enemy camp.\\"  So begins the story of Russel, the teenage protagonist of the new novel, Geography Club.  This is no spy novel, and Russel isn't talking about espionage, but he is in a situation that's almost as dangerous:  he's gay and naked in the locker room after high school P.E.<br />At age sixteen, Russel has finally had it with lurking around in the periphery of life.  Desperate to make contact with other gay kids, he hooks up with an online gay chat buddy--who turns out to be none other than baseball jock Kevin Land.  Before long, Russel and Kevin ferret out other local gay kids as well, including Russel's friend Min, who reveals she's bisexual, and Min's soccer-playing girlfriend, Terese.<BR> <BR>Problem is, they're not yet ready to tell the rest of the school they're gay.  So how do kids this diverse spend time together without calling attention to themselves?  Russel's--and Hartinger's--answer is as ingenious as it is witty:  they form an after-school club that sounds so boring no one else would ever think to join--the Geography Club.  But, of course, this being high school, things are never as simple as they seem.  Soon Russel and his friends are learning plenty about geography after all--specifically, the clique-conscious landscape of a typical American high school.<BR> <BR>This novel comes as a welcome relief from the overwrought, humorless gay teen novels of the past.  The book is funny, especially when Russel tries to avoid the charms of an overly persistent female admirer (\\"Her tongue was like a raw oyster with a mind of its own!\\").<BR> <BR>But this is also a novel with heart, particularly when the gay kids eventually clash over the question of whether or not to reach out to the school outcast who is rumored to be gay.  And I defy anyone not to be moved by the heart-pounding romance that builds between Russel and Kevin.<BR> <BR>The quality of gay books with teenager protagonists is spotty.  Thatsaid, Geography Club is EASILY one of the best gay teen book ever!
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|The first words Amazon notes about director Tim Burton are that \\"[A]fter a string of mediocre movies, director Tim Burton regains his footing...\\" with \\"Big Fish\\".<br /><br />After a string of WHAT? \\"Mediocre\\" movies???  Tim Burton, mediocre director? Excuse me?<br /><br />Nothing personal, but does the Amazon.com reviewer live in a cave, under a rock perhaps?<br /><br />That each Tim Burton movie is a visionary creation \\"sui generis\\", is evidenced in the following list of his movies swiped from the IMDB:<br /><br />Planet of the Apes (2001)<br />Stainboy (2000)<br />Sleepy Hollow (1999)<br />Mars Attacks! (1996)<br />Ed Wood (1994)<br />Batman Returns (1992)<br />Edward Scissorhands (1990)<br />Batman (1989)<br />Beetle Juice (1988)<br /><br />Now I'll admit to not having seen nor heard of \\"Stainboy\\" - but I can't find any \\"string\\" here except one of a kind of surreal and original artistic genius.  If the Amazon.com reviewer finds mediocrity in any of these movies, may I suggest another line of work (or at the very least, a genre other than editorial movie reviewing)?<br /><br />That Amazon.com published such an indefensibly wrongheaded introductory remark does nothing to assure readers of their due dilligence in the editorial process.<br /><br />That is to say, when an Amazon.com review is blatently specious, it must be called to task.  Expecting readers to simply accept as a given a most questionable premise flies not only in the face  of Logic (it begs the question), but is just pisspoor writing. The alledged \\"mediocrity\\" of Burton's output not only asserts a debatable premise as if it were a given fact, but presumes a certain, if undeserved, unimpeachable authority based on nothing but an unsubstianted opinion.<br /><br />Finally, Albert Finney and Tim Burton should have Oscars for this movie.

6301955609|4.0|Santa Sangre already has cult status as it is directed by Alejandro Jodorowsky, a multiply skilled artist who does not consider himself to be an artist.  Jodorowsky has not made more than six films over a 40-year span as he has had problems with producers and other people working in film.  El Top is a cult classic made by Jodorowsky in the early 70s where he is also the main character.  Allen Klein bought the rights to El Topo and was hoping for more films by Jodorowsky that could make him much money.  However, the business deal between Klein and Jodorowsky drew bad blood between them and as a result Klein refuses to ever release El Topo and now it is being withheld for public viewing by Allen Klein and his production company.  Santa Sangre is therefore one of his more accessible films as it has been applauded by large number of film critics as well as Jodorowsky's own followers.<br />Santa Sangre (Axel Jodorowsky) is a macabre horror tale surrounding a small circus where Fenix worked as magician when he was a young boy.  His dad, Orgo, was the manager and a knife thrower who also had a large appetite for women.  Concha, Fenix's mother, was in charge of a small cult that has gone into submission to a made-up saint whose arms were cut off and body raped.  When Concha caught Orgo cheating on her she attacked Orgo who in rage cut off Concha's arms followed by him slitting his own throat, and the whole gruesome event was witnessed by Fenix.  Fenix was institutionalized as he deeply suffered from the traumatic experience.  Years later his armless mother returns and helps him escape and together they become a murderous duo of enormous proportions.<br />Jodorowsky created a bizarre psychedelic horror story that visually connects the characters in a very sublime manner, which seems to seep into the subliminal consciousness of the audience.  The cinematic signs and syntaxes used in the film enhance the connection between the characters instead of the elaborately prolonged dialogues that often connect the characters in many films, which also is a trade mark of regular stage plays.  The young miming trapeze girl with a white painted face whom Fenix adored as a child, the tattoo's, and the symbolic knife are some examples of Jodorowsky cinematic genius as he enters the minds of the audience with this terrifying tale.  It is interesting to see that Jodorowsky casted his son as the lead character, which he performs elegantly.  In the end the audience is to experience a dazzling cinematic event as it brings the audience suspense, horror, desire, and much more to think about as the film unfolds.alogues that often connect the characters in many films, which also is a trade mark of regular stage plays.

B00006DEFA|5.0|When I saw this movie in its original release in 1984, it was only due to the fact that I was dragged to the theatre. (A movie about Mozart -- BORING!!) I have never been so quick to change my mind. From the opening moments, hearing F. Murray Abraham shout out the word &quot;MOZART&quot; I was hooked, and my eyes never waivered from the screen. I anxiously awaited the release of this Director's Cut, due primarly to the extras that were purported to be included. The extras more than deliver on their promise. <br />Not only did I get the joy of watching once again one of the best movies to have ever been released -- to remember how enthralled I was by the performances of Tom Hulce, F. Murray Abraham and Elizabeth Berridge (unfortunately, most reviewers tend to exclude her contribution to this movie, but her performance as Constanza, Mozart's wife, is as powerful as the others) -- but the extras (behind the scenes, the commentaries) added to my delight. <br />I truly find it hard to put into words how wonderful this movie is. I have spent the last 20 years telling people &quot;Trust me, just watch it, and you will understand what I am talking about.&quot; It is more than just a grand journey through the worlds of these two men (yes, granted, told from a &quot;movie&quot; point-of-view). The entire package, from the scenery, the costumes, the story and THE MUSIC, THE MUSIC, THE MUSIC!!! shows you how a movie should and can be produced. Even if you can't stand classical music, you will adore the wonder that is Mozart. <br />Please -- I'm begging you -- WATCH THIS MOVIE. You will NOT be disappointed!!!

In order to accomplish the heist Croker has asked the old-timer John Bridger (Donald Sutherland) to help crack the safe in which the gold is located.  They get safely away with a large amount of gold, however, Steve (Edward Norton) has decided to keep all the gold for himself and kill the rest of the group.  Steve shoots John while the rest of the group escapes, but they decide on settling the score with Steve as they decide to take the gold back with the help of John's daughter Stella (Charlize Theron).  The Italian Job is a fun and suspenseful action film with car chases and dubious schemes, which leaves the audience with a good cinematic experience.

B0001MDP3G|5.0|Cold Mountain is traumatic love story of hope, loss, and dreams where Inman (Jude Law) is at war against the North and his beloved Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman) is home anticipating his return.  The only news Ada receives is that more men are dying as most of the former male population of Cold Mountain is now dead.  Inman continuously reads the few letters that he has received as it keeps him hoping of getting home and holding his adored Ada in his arms.  However, he only sees blood and mud up to the knees as the meaningless war is fought and more men are being killed.  This leaves mothers mourning their children and wives turning into widows.  Despite this madness Inman is a decorated soldier who has frequently displayed his courage in battle, which often leads him into further battles as the officers trust his dedication. In a nightly skirmish Inman is wounded and sent to a hospital where he receives another letter from Ada begging him to stop marching for war and return home as she is helplessly anticipating his return. Inman decides to do as Ada requests as he hears that the South is now fighting a losing war, but he also knows that if he is captured he is considered a deserter and deserters are shot on the spot.<br /><br />Cold Mountain is a powerful film displaying an intense love story between Ada and Inman where the Civil War is separating them indefinitely.  The Minghella illustrates the importance of love as it is what keeps Inman alive and dreaming of something much better than the malice of war.  However, Minghella shows the contrast to love by shooting some very graphic battles scenes that erupt in the audience's face where soldiers stab, shot, and maim each other in the name of freedom and peace.  The most intense example is where the soldiers are stepping on top of wounded men in the bottom of a mud pit where they are to face a certain death.  This demonstrates the ease of destroying life while the difficulty in maintaining life is showed throughout the film.  The film also address women's issues through the many different women in the film and how their lives are threatened as the men are killed at war.  When viewing this film it brings strong emotions against war and wishes that the women would go on similar strike as in Aristophanes's Lysistrata.  This is definitely a very political film as it offers much pondering why we are here while we are here, which in the end offers a great cinematic experience.m.

B0001Z52RU|4.0|While &quot;The Butterfly Effect&quot; wasn't critically acclaimed or well loved by everyone, I thought it was a pretty good movie when I first saw it at the theatres.  It was a dark and completely disturbing film that made me want to look away at times, but at the same time I was very intrigued.  My only problem was the ending.  I thought it really contradicted the whole theme of the movie, but I always suspected that the so-called &quot;happy ending&quot; was forced upon since the movie is so dark and hard to watch that they thought there was no way people would like it if a more darker and depressing ending were added.  Well, now you get to see the director's cut of the film that's on this very DVD, which offers the superior ending.<br />Evan had terrible blackouts when he was little, very much like his father.  He would blackout during terrible situations and not remember anything.  That's when it was suggested to him that he keep a journal to see if he could remember what happened during those blackouts.  When Evan is all grown up, still haunted by his terrible past that had blanketed him and his friends, he discovers that he can relive those memories when he reads his entries.  He can view it like a movie and finally see what had happened during his blackouts.  Not only that, but he has the power to even alter those moments.  Determined to fix the pasts of him and his friends, he relives those memories and tries to fix them so they will all have a better future.  However, when he tries to change one thing, it leads to devastating results that he could have never foreseen.  As the cover says, &quot;Change one thing... change EVERYTHING.&quot;<br />I found this film to be very interesting and complex, even though I felt that the film itself was not perfect.  The movie is very hard to watch at times, so it's not recommended for those who don't like being disturbed or who are extremely sensitive to such matters.  I think it has a smart storyline and great acting.  Believe it or not, Ashton Kutcher is able to act in a serious role.  I didn't even recognize him at first, but he really pulled it off.  He was able to convince me that he was in fact &quot;Evan,&quot; as he played the role with determination and force.<br />As I said in the beginning, my major problem with the movie had always been the ending.  While it was happy and nice to see that things worked out considering the absolute hell this movie can put you through, I still found the ending to be contradictive and a &quot;cop-out.&quot;  Now, all of that's changed as you are given the choice to either watch the theatrical version, OR the director's cut.  The director's cut offers a few more extra minutes that adds more substance to the story (including an interesting find) and a more appropriate ending.  If you were to ask me which version is better, I'd say that the director's cut is without any hesitation  The new ending does a better job of fitting in with the theme of the movie and doesn't contradict the film as the theatrical ending does.  The DVD also offers &quot;infinifilm&quot; features that give you a deeper insight to the movie itself.  Extras included are commentary, documentaries, storyboard galleries and much more.  I must say that the film looks great, and also sounds fantastic as well.<br />&quot;The Butterfly Effect&quot; proves to be an even stronger film with the director's cut version, even if it's still not a perfect movie.  If you're looking for something a little more darker and sinister than your regular picks, then this is something to consider.  Just remember that this movie does not let you off easy.  It's brutal and extremely disturbing.  If you're daring and think you can handle it, then pick this up and prepare for one unforgettable and chilling ride. -Michael CraneBelieve it or not, Ashton Kutcher is able to act in a serious role.

B00005JNH0|5.0|I went with four people to see this film. Two (myself included) were Metallica fans and the other two were not. The film opens like some sort of MTV expo piece with James Hetfield riding in his tricked out vintage roadster and Lars Ulrich laying on his couch with his Basquiat hanging on the wall. Not even five minutes go by and it shows the group, minus recently departed Jason Newsted, in therapy discussing their concern that they have about embarking on recording their first album in five years. Little did they know that it would take two years to make. What you get is a riveting, profound and at often times very funny documentary.<br />What I really applaud the band for is this: They bought the rights to the documentary so that they could have a say in the final cut. Instead of glossing over scenes that aired the dirty laundry of the band, which is what you would think they would do in a case like this, they let it all out. <BR>And not in a counter-culture, rebellious, grandstanding kind of way either. It's sincere and thats what makes the film work. <br />James Hetfields door slamming, Lars' watery-eyed confrontations and Kirk unable to make declarative sentences does not put them in the best light, but it makes them real.<BR>They confront their demons head-on with therapist Phil Towle and producer Bob Rock tow. Die hard fans might roll their eyes and laugh at prospect of the band in need of a shrink. Trust me, stick with it and don't let it scare you away from the theatre. Most of the time it is hilarious and at the bands expense. Lars Ulrichs father is a scream and when one of the toughest metal bands try to communicate with one another in their new found \\"therapy lingo\\" it comes across as comical and awkward as you might think. And yes, they talk about Cliff's death and the Napster ordeal as well. They also visit Jason Newsted and (bonus for fans) Dave Mustaine. My friend and I could pick out the Metallica fans from the documentary fans in the theatre when Dave popped up.<br /> This movie is not solely for fans should not be missed no matter what your preference in music or your opinion of the band. Non-fans, as my other friends will attest, will enjoy this as well.<BR>This year there has been great year for documentaries and this is one that should not be overlooked in the mix.

Taut, psychologically suspenseful, and brilliantly constructed like McCrae's &quot;The Bark of the Dogwood&quot; or some of Hemingway's works (though those are of an entirely different subject matter),this tour-de-force will have you wanting to tackle the other books in the series.  Highly recommended.
B0001MDP3G|4.0|Cold Mountain is a sad romance about the Civil War that shows us the effects of the war on the home front and the women of the Old South.  We all expect that we know what happened to the people who lived and fought at the various fronts of the war with all its direct horrors.  There is one spectacular battle scene - The Siege of Petersburg.<br />Ada Monroe (played beautifully by Nicole Kidman) is a Southern Belle transplanted to rustic surroundings with her father, the Reverend Monroe (handsomely done by Donald Sutherland).  She is widely admired, but lives a lonely life.  Her special admirer is Inman (the always fine Jude Law) who is man of few words with a strong internal life that is somewhat disconnected from the world around him.<br />When Ada finds herself on her own she fares terribly and survives only by the kindness of her neighbors.  When the war comes and most of the men go off to the war one man that stays behind is named Teague (portrayed with real intensity by Ray Winstone).  Ada's friends send Ruby Thews (Ruby Tuesday?) to live with her because Ruby knows how to work the land and survive while Ada is an out of place jewel.<br />Renee Zellweger's performance as Ruby is powerful and is really the heartbeat of the movie if not the lyric poetry of it.  There is a reason Ruby is the character that lingers in the mind vividly.  Ruby and Ada thrive together and as the war turns against the south the Home Guard rises in power ostensibly to protect the people behind the lines.  Really, they prey on the citizens to advance their own greed and power.  Kathy Baker and James Gammon portray Sally and Esco Swanger who help Ada and Ruby and end up suffering terribly at the hands of the predatory protectors.<br />Inman wends his way home and has many adventures and the love that he and Ada share is powerful and unreasonable.  Both of them realize this and do not really understand why their slight experience together binds them so powerfully.  Ada is even unsure that Inman is alive except for some visionary hope.<br />Brendan Gleeson is fine as Ruby's musician father and Philip Seymour Hoffman is indelible as the Reverend Veasey.  I don't know how Mr. Hoffman consistently makes his portrayals so memorable, but he always contributes a richness to his roles that he raises the quality of everything I have seen him in.<br />This movie has a bleakness about it that some may find too cold, and I understand that.  However, I enjoyed the quiet depth of feeling between the characters during such amazingly hard times.  I especially enjoyed seeing the Civil War's effects on those at home who were nonetheless in the war and paid so deep a price.  To see some of that coming from those who were entrusted to protect them is all the more horrifying.nman is alive except for some visionary hope.<br />Brendan Gleeson is fine as Ruby's musician father and Philip Seymour Hoffman is indelible as the Reverend Veasey.

B000001EGA|5.0|If Elton John's career ever mirrored a baseball game, you could easily surmise that, just like in baseball when the bases are loaded and you need a hit, Elton not only delivered but knocked it out of the ball park with this release. It was 1975 and the incredible songwriting team of Elton John and Bernie Taupin was gradually reaching new heights with each release. <br />Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy is their finest album in all ways: production, melody, vocally and the best performance by his then band. In addition, these are likey to be the best lyrics Bernie Taupin ever penned. He is writing in the first person narrative for a change on all the songs. And, finally, Elton is singing lyrics that he can relate to because all of the songs are about the era when he and Bernie first met and stardom hadn't arrived (1967-1969).<br />The title track simply tells the story of their partnership: &quot;Captain Fantastic, raised and regimented, hardly a hero, just someone his mother might know&quot;. How fitting a description for young Elton - shy, unassuming, average. While later on Elton sings: &quot;Brown Dirt Cowboy, still green and growing...hand in hand went music and rhyme, the captain and the kid, stepping in the ring, from here on Sonny, it's a long and lonely climb.&quot; The melody starts with a country flare that rocks out during the chorus...a incredible arrangement that balances rock (Elton) with country (Taupin).<br />Tower of Babel hints at their first glimpse of the music business: &quot;where were all your shoulders when we cried?&quot; Taupin laments. &quot;Bitter Fingers&quot; tells the tale of the doing the club circuit as a struggling band. &quot;Tell Me When The Whistle Blows&quot; is Taupins story of his journey from the countryside in England to London where he would write with Elton. This song in particular has a very urban and soulful sound and captures the lyric perfectly. The big hit from the album, &quot;Someone Saved My Life Tonight&quot; is yet another superb power ballad, much in the same vein as &quot;Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me&quot;. Elton sings with much conviction on this one and the backing vocal of his song capture every nuance and pain in the lyric. Further, Nigel Olsson's drum playing on this song may be his finest performance as he dramatically pushes the song to its emotional climax. <br />The second half of the album kicks off with &quot;Gotta Get A Meal Ticket&quot; which is about the first publishing deal Elton and Taupin signed and the anxieties that come with it: &quot;while the other climb reaching dizzy heights, the world's in front of me in black and white, I'm on the bottom line.&quot; Further, Elton sings: &quot;shake a hand if you have to, trust in us and we'll love you anyway.&quot; The very wary writers of course need a record deal to make it and this song typifies that experience. Guitarist Davey Johnstone's opening hook may be his best since Saturday Nights Alright For Fighting - his guitar soars on this song. The next song, Writing is a relatively simple song that seeks to wonder if the duo have a lengthy future in front of them. We All Fall In Love Sometimes/Curtains finishes in what must be the best closing to an Elton John album ever. The first part deals with a brotherly affection Elton and Taupin discovered when they met and Curtains is simply a song about their childhood wish that came true. Elton has never sounded so sincere as he does here. While it's true he has been delivering Taupin's words for years as if he wrote them himself, there is something distinctively different about his deliverly this time. Frankly, this could be his best vocal performance ever.<br />A couple of extra tracks are included on this remastered version: the wonderful philly soul hit &quot;Philadelphia Freedom&quot;, Elton's dynamite cover of the Beatles &quot;Lucy In The Sky&quot; and a less than necessary cover of John Lennon's &quot;One Day At A Time&quot; from his Mind Gamesrelease. Since these songs have no relation to the Captain Fantastic concept album, I would have left them off and put them on another more appropriate re-release. <br />Producer Gus Dudgeon give each song here a pristine shine and each band member showcases their incredible talents. This also represents the last album by the original lineup. While they didn't realize it at the time, this was to be their swan song until 1983. Elton moved on into different areas after this and things were never really the same again. <br />It's hard to believe that just two years prior, Elton released Goodbye Yellow Brick Road - another masterpiece. Within 3 years, Elton delivered two albums of career peaking quality. And while Yellow Brick Road usually gets the nod as his finest album because it has more pop accessibility then this release, Captain Fantastic shouldn't be over looked. <br />If Goodbye Yellow Brick Road was his answer to, say, The Beatles &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;, then Captain Fantastic would be Elton's equilvalent to &quot;Abbey Road.&quot;
6304539282|3.0|We don't need any (...) rings around the exploding Death Star.  And what even confuses me more, in ROTJ (...) ring around Death Star II when Ewoks see it, it's the original shot.  Huh?  And the thing that explains the Special Mediocre Editions is one word: Greedo.<br />Greedo shoots first, ugh!<BR>Greedo - \\"O\\" = Greed, plenty of that within George Lucas.<br />One good thing about the new, new editions, Han will shoot first again.  I liked the old Ewok song.  I liked the Jawa unloading scene.  I hated Luke's scream.  The John Williams music that's there is spectacular.  But how is a guy that's 3 feet away from someone miss?  And...why would Jabba hire him if he was a mediocre shot?   And...how in h*ll does Han dislocate his spine and not escape with even a scar?   And...when Greedo shoots the wall there's no d*mn mark.  This just left me saying, \\"Huh?\\"  But if you want your OT on DVD, I know how you can do it.  Transfer it.  I did, it, and it's superb, even if it's 2-channel.  And on my DVD, Lucas said something, and made a liar out of himself.  \\"You see an effect without a film, is a very boring thing.  What you need is a plot, good actors, and interesting storytelling and good FX.  But bad FX and good story can still be a good movie.\\"  It may not be his exact words, but that's what he said in \\"From Star Wars to Jedi: The Making of a Saga\\".  And that was very interesting.  And I don't need CGI, fake-looking, terrible voiced Muppets.  And why in h*ll does Lucas think I wanna see inside their mouths.  That's just disgusting.
B00007GZR5|4.0|There are surprisingly few movies dealing with a nonterrestrial afterlife.  While there are hundreds of films dealing with the existence of individuals following death as embodied or disembodied spirits on earth, there are remarkably few that provide any glimpse of heaven.  The few that do tend to present it as an inconceivably white, vast, and indistinct place, from HERE COMES MR. JORDAN to A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH to THE HORN BLOWS AT MIDNIGHT.  In contrast to these other films, WHAT DREAMS MAY COME stands out as one of the most intensely colorful, beautiful, and vividly concrete films in cinema history.<br />The cast of the film is strong, but it would be a mistake to imagine that they are the reason for the film's success.  Robin Williams as Chris Nielsen, Cuba Gooding Jr., Rosalind Chao (who I previously mainly knew only from STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION), Max von Sydow, and the lovely but underused (not only in this film, but by Hollywood in general) Annabella Sciorra all hand in wonderful performances, but they are largely overwhelmed by the astonishing beauty of the sets, the inconceivably vivid colors, and the marvelous use of light.  No performers could have competed, though they try gamely.<br />I find the film especially interesting for theological reasons.  Ron Bass based the screenplay on a novel by Richard Mattheson.  I must confess to not knowing the work of either, but I would lay heavy money that one of them (probably Mattheson) knew well C. S. Lewis's THE GREAT DIVORCE.  In that work Lewis was concerned to lay out a concept of heaven and hell that did not regard God as responsible for sending people to hell.  Instead, he described an afterlife in which people in hell still had the option of leaving hell and departing for heaven.  These two ideas--of people placing themselves in hell and of having the option to leave hell for heaven--drive the metaphysics of WHAT DREAMS MAY COME, as I'm sure anyone who has seen the film will recognize.<br />So why do I give the film only four stars after all the nice things I have said about it?  Primarily because the film doesn't really have all that much of a story to tell.  The plot feels like a short subject stretched to feature length film proportions.  Once you subtract all the amazing visuals, there simply wasn't that much to the film.  The challenge for the filmmakers was primarily padding out the action of the film.  Nonetheless, I do recommend this as an interesting and intensely beautiful film, despite the slender narrative.<br />Interestingly, the title of the film comes from Hamlet's famous soliloquy, in which he ponders whether or not to commit suicide.  In the end, he decides not to because of the dreams that the dead may dream, presumably worse for having killed oneself.  But such dreams did not prevent Annie Nielsen in the film from committing suicide.  It is a nice ironical touch.>So why do I give the film only four stars after all the nice things I have said about it?

B00008WT5C|3.0|This is the first AC DC album I bought, and one of the first rock albums.  The group was raw, in sound and lyrics, and fast and hard.  This is also the earliest release I have of them.  A lot of the songs were made to be cranked up, and actually sound better, when done so. <BR>THE GOOD<BR>Never really much good in a AC DC release, most of the cds could be made into, pre bon, and post bon.  Some catch hooks and the singing is pretty good.  Some of their better Bon area songs are on this, GO DOWN, WHOLE LOTTA ROSIE, PROBLEM CHILD, and LET THERE BE ROCK.<BR>THE BAD <BR>Production stinks.  But I grew up an BACK IN BLACK, and \\"Mutt\\" produced that cd.  A cd that all their cds would have to be held up to.<BR>This is a middle of the road cd for the group, not their best, and not their worst.  Could have been better, with a better producer.<BR>C.P.O.V.<BR>As with this group, sex, drugs, and hell, is always what they are about.  HELL AINT A BAD PALCE TO BE, is about NY city, but they seem to stay there.  GO DOWN, is about oral sex.  WHOLE LOTTA ROSIE, is a fat whore.  Same old songs.-EJW
B0002234LS|2.0|Gotta hand it to this Johnny Depp guy:  the dude has some range.  From Revlon mascara in &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean,&quot; Depp makes yet another fashion statement--ultimately showing that blondes do indeed have more fun--in his role as an addled, befuddled, quirky, annoying writer in the film SECRET WINDOW.<br />In fact, there wasn't much to this movie that I didn't find annoying.  The plot was tedious and anemic, as was Depp's performance as writer Mort Rainey.  And let's not forget (oh, how could we?) the persistent redneck hick, played by a backwoods-looking John Turturro, who basically has one line in this film, uttered ad nauseum:  &quot;You stole my story.&quot;  With Mario Bello playing Depp's soon-to-be ex, and Timothy Hutton in the role as the soon-to-be ex's main squeeze, we suddenly have all the ingredients for an out-of-control, over-the-top ending that comes from literally nowhere.<br />Allegedly supposed to be some sort of a thriller, SECRET WINDOW is a wet noodle devoid of even spaghetti sauce.  A reclusive writer in a cabin, stalked by a Mississippi nutcase, a bitter divorce, and then total wackiness--none of this stuff works.  At least Depp's blonde hairdo works.  I wonder if he'll be a fiery redhead in his next role?<br />--D. Mikels
B00008J4P5|5.0|When I heard Seven Nation Army on the radio, I was amazed, it was one of the only things I had heard all day that was worth listening to. I very much dislike modern music, most of it is done by talentless, repetitive, lame-asses, who don't write they're own music. But the White Stripes are reason for celebration, all their CD's are very good, but Elephant is the most impressive. They have a very distinct sound similar to that of Led Zeppelin (especially Jack White's voice and guitar style), and unlike many other CD's that have only a few good songs and then a lot of fillers, this CD is listenable the WHOLE WAY THROUGH, a very nice change from the norm. Not a single track sounds like another, each is unique. I feel satisfied after listening to Elephant, and I have heard it more than 20 times in a couple weeks. When its done, you are not left wanting more, but in a good way :)<br />Seven Nation Army - 10/10 Infectious beat, great guitar and an awesome beat.<br />Black Math - 10/10 One of my favorite tracks, rocks very hard, I love the guitar work in all of these songs, but this in particular. <br />There's No Room For You Here - 10/10 Cool, very good guitar. Kinda funny lyrics<br />I Don't Know What To Do With Myself - 10/10  A real thrasher. Rocks REALLY hard near the end<br />In The Cold Cold Night - 10/10 One of the more plesent tracks, nice lyrics and good to hear Meg singing. Quite refreshing<br />I Want To Be The Boy To Warm Your Mother's Heart - 10/10 More mellow, kinda like a masculine version of In The Cold Cold Night. This, In Your Pocket, and Cold Cold are the three chillin' middle tracks.<br />You've Got Here In Your Pocket - 10/10 Great lyrics, nice acoustic guitar, now is where the CD eases out of the mellow middle part.<br />Ball And Biscuit - 10/10 Heavy bass throughout, this track is really badass :)I love the beat, it should be in a crime movie, u can just picture some mean dude walkin in slo-mo. lol<br />The Hardest Button To Button - 10/10 Anotherone of my favorites, good lyrics, good beat, just hella-sweet song.<br />Little Acorns - 10/10 The intro to this is really annoying, but after the beginning, it is another excellent track, worth the wait.<br />Hypnotise - 9/10 The only non 10/10 track on the CD is still very good.<br />The Air Near My Fingers - 10/10 Very cool beat, love Jack in this one, this is a great song.<br />Girl, You Have No Faith In Medicine - 10/10 I LOVE THIS SONG!!!<br />Well It's True... 10/10 Fun little ditty to finish off the CD, i love it.<br />Buy ASAP!!!

B00028HBKM|2.0|ITs hard for me to put into words what this film made me feel. I guess that it did provoke a reaction at all means that the filmaker did his job.The film inspires anger rather than compassion. It reminds us how brutal mankind is. What the film does not do though it represent the subject matter as historically correct. I would have liked to see more of the stuff included in about Jesus the person, and the brutality of this film is kinda kard to take. Again, I wanted the jews and the Romans to die slow painful deaths at the end of this film. The film  did nothing to enlighten me to the journey of Jesus however, and that is the main flaw to this film. I get the feeling that Mel Gibson wants to convert people the old fashion way, to invoke fear of losing faith. All that being said, the film was shot beautifully, the acting was good. IF it didn't have to have an agenda and wasn't so political, then I might have liked this film better. And what about Mary Magdelane? Haven't we learned enough by now to put her out of the role of the prostitute and into the woman who loved and was loved by Jesus. Think folks, Jesus was a human, if he were watching this film, do you think he would like it? I don't think so. He was a friend to the sinners, not the right wing, the establishment that praises him today is the very system that he fought against. The very system that killed him. Also, Mel Gibson has made a lot of money out of the torture and death of this wise man. I hope it is being given to those who need it, and not to buy another personal jet, or a new house in Tuscany.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Pop music is such a stale genre how can you listen to this ?. You don't need to buy this album(why would you?) because you eventulally here every song on MTV repeated no less than 20 times a day.Every song sounds the same and lyrically the content is repetitive and not diverse.What you need is Superunknown, Soundgarden rocks.... daaa Whose Soundgarden?
B00005JMYG|1.0|I just saw this movie expecting to see the Will Ferrell who was funny in Old School, but instead I saw a movie that actually appeared to be written by a small child in school.  The type of humor in this movie was quite infantile.  Will Ferrell wasn't remotely funny in this movie and for the most part he was down right annoying. The way Will Ferrell was acting in this movie reminded me of Pluto Nash when you could see in Eddie Murphy's eyes the he knew the movie was stupid.  Save your money and go buy some beer.
6305095442|5.0|The thrills have increased, and so have the chills. This is by far the scariest movie out of the triology. In a way, i dont fully understand it, because why would Bruce Campbell venture with his new girl friend all the way back up to the cabin where the original massacre happened? I mean its not like you would forget something like that so easily, i mean come on! But besides some incredibly stupid moves, this movie is still pretty good.
B000089RVX|4.0|I don't like much pop music.  Really.  I'm pretty picky.  I don't like rock.  I don't like rap.  I listen to a lot of Broadway music and Christian music.  But when a friend of mine left a (burned, sigh) copy of this CD at my house, I gave it a try.  And I've listened to it pretty much non-stop since.  Someone made the comment that she sounds like she's auditioning for a Broadway show.  She doesn't, but umm, that just proves she can sing.  Her voice is incredible.  The musician in me ADORES this CD, even though the chords are weird beyond weird.  In short, listen to it.  If you don't like it, well, then, I'm sorry.  But I think you might.  Especially if you like real music and not just pop.<br />There is a reason for the 4 stars, though.  Many of the songs sound very similar.  Now, I LIKE how they sound, but a bit more variety would be nice.  I think every song is in a minor key.  <br />Now, I'm off to buy a real copy of this CD...
B000063DFN|5.0|I must say that this is probably my all around favorite Iron Maiden album. I actually recieved this cd as a gift, and wasn't exactly sure it was going to be as good as other Maiden albums I had previously heard. To my delight i was WRONG!! some of its songs are different from old Maiden, but still amazing. The song (other than Powerslave) that caught my ear immediately was Flash of the Blade, simply an amazing sound all around, especially the vocals and the solo's.In fact the only song on here that i didnt think to be excellent is Back in the Village. It's still a pretty good song, but it just doesnt seem to fit with the others as well. Anyways, buy this album if your any bit interested in Maiden, and if your not than buy it anyway and you will be. heres my rating for each track:<br />Aces High 9.8<BR>2 Minutes to Midnight 8.8<BR>Losfer Words (Big 'Orra) 9.2 <BR>Flash of the Blade 10.0+<BR>The Duellists 9.3<BR>Back in the Village 7.6<BR>Powerslave 10.0+<BR>Rime of the Ancient Mariner 10.0
B00006CXXU|1.0|please listen 2 me and don't buy this cd. i have buy it and now i just feel bad after listen to it. the reason that it bad is because christina write most the songs' lyrics. her writing is bad as well as the beat of the songs. i'm not being criticism but she should let the lyric to lyricists. although there are some good like &amp;amp;quot;can't hold us down&amp;amp;quot; &amp;amp;quot;beautiful&amp;amp;quot; &amp;amp;quot;impossible&amp;amp;quot; and &amp;amp;quot;dirrty&amp;amp;quot; but overall the bad outweight the good. if you bought this cd, i would feel sorry for you.
B000000WF0|5.0|I got this CD two weeks ago, and it hasn't come out of CD player since. After I first heard Bitter Sweet Symphony, I knew I had to get it... that song is great on so many levels.<br />1. Bitter Sweet Symphony (10/10)- The violin music in the beginning sets the tone for the entire piece, and I love it. This has no competition- it's my favorite song.<br />2. Sonnet (9/10) I think I might be a little prejudiced with this song, because you can see what comes before it... it's a sweet song, but it doesn't really compare...<br />3. The Rolling People (10/10) I love this song, as well. It shows a different side of The Verve, and it's great, too. This one isn't slow... good contrast.<br />4. The Drugs Don't Work (9/10)- Very soulful. <br />5. Catching the Butterfly (10/10) 'I'm gonna keep catching that butterfly in that dream of mine...' great melody, and I love the lyrics...<br />6. Neon Wilderness (7/10) This song sounds like it wasn't finished... my least favorite. I usually skip through this one.<br />7. Space and Time (10/10) I love the 'I just can't make it alone' part of this song... makes my want to sing... or perhaps jump up and dance. Either one. <br />8. Weeping Willow (10/10) You never hear the lyrics 'weeping willow' in this song until the very end, but when you do, they really mean something. Not quite sure WHAT, but something...<br />9. Lucky Man (10/10)- I love this one, as well.<br />10. One Day (10/10) The lyrics and the song are both so sweet in this song... <br />11. This Time (8/10)- I like this one, but not quite as much as the others.<br />12. Velvet Morning (10/10) I love when the music changes from soft and slow to loud and a bit wilder... It's like, 'dumdumdumdumdum- ANOTHER VELVET MORNING FOR ME.' Kinda takes you by surprise. :)<br />13. Come On (10/10)- Perfect ending... 'Come along with our sound'. Fabulous.<br />End rating (drum roll, please): 123 stars out of 130. That's a pretty good percentage. Get this CD... I loved it. And, once you hear Bitter Sweet Symphony, you're pretty much sold already...
B0000DD7LB|5.0|hello! i'm not really a britney fan but recently i just go this cd as a gift from a friend and i must say that this is really good stuff.  this cd is the best ever.  she has really mature in her music and you can hear hip hop feel to this cd.  the only thing that i don't really like about this cd is that she rap a couple of times on the cd.  i don't like her rap, at all but it not that annoying.  other than that this is a great cd.  buy it and you won't dissapoint or u can send an e-mail to me at hantrin@go.com
B0000CDL93|5.0|Okay, I have a little trouble with the swearing but guess people can ignore it or get a blocker.  That said, this was an outstanding movie and really made you think about the unthinkable. There are coverups that most of us have no clue about.The higher ups regardless of what people may think pull many strings to get done what they want done. Those we have always sought to trust can also be the ones who betray us. War is money and I am convinced, that the murder of JFK was a well orchestrated event. Buy the DVD with the accompaining documentary. It amazes me how some people refuse to believe it. BELIEVE IT. I love America but we are no saints here.  Money and power is always a driving force. Don't ever think it can't happen here. Kevin Costner gives a brilliant performance and the impassioned speech in court toward the end of the movie that he gave portraying Jim Garrison drew me in like nothing I have ever heard. Watch &quot;Thirteen Days&quot; first than this one and rethink the situation and see what you come up with.

It's not real scary, The only thing that scares you is the expectation of what's going to happen next.  Secret Window also has an ending that you would never expect.  This movie wasn't the best movie I ever seen but still a very good movie!
B000099T2L|5.0|It blows my mind as to how talented some people are when it comes to creating background music AND lyrics to go with it.<br />I have been a fan of Destiny's Child since &quot;Bills, Bills, Bills,&quot; so I was excited to hear of this solo debut.  All to often have I bought a cd after hearing only the first single, so I decided to wait and see what other hits came out of this.  Her first two singles (&quot;Crazy In Love&quot; and &quot;Baby Boy&quot; were awesome, but the single that did it for me was &quot;Me, Myself and I.&quot;  BOTH the remix (sadly, not on the cd) and the original have killer beats.  It's such a great song with a great video to match.  <br />I wonder why artists don't release more of their songs as singles.  Other songs that could stand out as successful singles include &quot;Hip-Hop Star&quot; (a crazy beat with a colorful chorus to match), &quot;Signs&quot; (a totally awesome beat with creative lyrics), and &quot;That's How You Like It,&quot; (a cute, catchy little ditty).  Her duet with Luther Vandross, &quot;The Closer I Get To You,&quot; would fit right in on BET's &quot;Midnight Love.&quot;<br />Indeed, the aformentioned songs are extremely radio-friendly.  I can't wait to see what else Miss Knowles has up her sleeve.
B00006AG5N|1.0|First of all, I love Elvis' music and have collected it for years and I have to admit if this is your first Elvis CD you probably will be satisfied. My problem with this CD is that Fool Such As I and The Wonder Of You are not the original hit versions that played on the radio way back when and helped build the King's legend. Fool is an alternate take and Wonder is a different live performance. These takes were never #1 anywhere and when you compare the original hits with these alternates you realise that RCA picked the right masters to originally release. In my opinion this is obscuring the King's legacy and in a way changing history for the new listener and not giving them all the goodness that was Elvis. Why would BMG do this? I suspect it is to coax the serious Elvis collector to buy yet again another rehash of hits that they have already bought many times over, just to get these two &quot;special&quot; tracks, and the novice Elvis collector wouldn't notice the difference. I would much rather have preferred a new two CD set of all the correct recordings remastered with today's technology (like the The Top Ten Hits did in 1988) and then have a seperate collection of nothing but unreleased alternates. However, these alternates always get sprinkled very sparingly in these endless Greatest Hits rehashes. But then again, I'm not a BMG marketing director, just another one of the millions of Elvis fans with money in my pocket.
B00000JNJ1|5.0|I always loved bands like the Beatles, Bob Dylan, Rolling Stones, Zeppelin, or the Who, but avoided Rod Stewart because he kind of sucks nowadays. Then, I randomly picked up Jeff Beck's \\"Truth\\" and was introduced to early Rod Stewart and the Faces. <br />While I think the Faces rocked just as hard as the Stones or Who (except they sound like they are having much more fun), the early Rod Stewart lyrics are so honest and full of substance, I think if he had not sold out, he could have rivaled Bob Dylan as rock's greatest poet. <br />Thus, the best songs are those that combine Rod Stewart's honest lyrical side with straight forward rock -- Bad N' Ruin, Sweet Lady Mary, Three Button Hand Me Down. The drunker, philandering, almost sexist, blusy side seen in Too Bad, Stay with Me, Borstal Boys, and Had Me a Real Good Time are fun and exciting rock, but unfortunately foreshadow the Rod Stewart of the late 1970's (thank god Silicone Grown is left off this compilation).<br />A Faces compilation presents a problem. One CD (80 minutes) is not enough time to showcase all of the highlights, yet 2 CDs would make the collection more expensive (and less accessable) and may have made a \\"best of\\" rambling and directionless.<br />With that said, this CD is excellent and the best they could do. While some omissions are regrettable (espicially Maybe I'm Amazed and Memphis), others are forgiveable (like My Fault or Richmond). <br />This CD is a rarity in compliations. It includes the Faces most obviously best songs (Too Bad, Bad N' Ruin, Stay with Me, etc.) with others that showcase the range of talents for the band; others that will hopefully introduce this wonderful band and early Rod Stewart CDs to a new generation. If I had to put together a Faces greatest hits CD, this is, with one or two exceptions, *exactly* how I would have done it. Well done, Rhino!<br />PS -- As a side note, the Faces performed as a band on several Rod Stewart solo albums; I wish the songs could be on a Faces compilation.
0425173895|5.0|The plot is awesome and it contains a great ending - that I did not see coming.  A few things that make Agatha Christie great are: (1) her writing is lean and spare; (2) her characters all have an important role to play; (3) she has a sense of humor; and (4) there are no silly chase scenes or senseless violence.  A thoughtfully written mystery.
B00005JMYG|2.0|The two best comedians in the film are Will Ferrell and Steve Carrell.  Both are given some (if not all) of the best jokes of the movie and deliver them fairly well.  This was probably not an accident since both are the best known among the entire cast, (Carrell known for his stint on the Daily Show). The rest of the cast could have been locked in a closet the rest of the time and I wouldn't have noticed or cared.  But who's really going to see this movie for Christina Applegate, Paul Rudd and Adam McKay's acting?  Nobody.<br />The film is insane, inane, and sometimes just plain stupid but Ferrell and Carrell seem to make it all a little more bearable.  <br />I would suggest this movie instead of Vince Vaughn and Ben Stiller's (who both make cameos in this film) current film, Dodgeball, but if you really want to see Ferrell, get the two movies that give him better material for him to work with, Old School or Elf.  Or even get the SNL dvd devoted to him.  <br />Overall, this movie isn't a waste of money or time if you're into movies like Old School and Dodgeball but wait till it shows up on Amazon or Blockbuster.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|A wonderfully integrated ensemble cast that is story driven with witty and original dialogue set against a western frontier view of the far regions of space 500 years from present.<br />Serenity , the name of the rugged but versatile freighter of the Firefly class cargo ships, is the home and lifeline of Captain Mal Reynolds his crew and passengers.<br />Only 14 stories were produced before the  clueless Fox Studios executives axed the show after much boneheaded TV time slot planning.<br />But Universal Studios bought the rights to produce a movie with all original members present to continue the story after seeing the phenomenal sales of the DVDs and the loyalty of fans around the world, the exciting, loving and talented actors and the persistence of writer and director Josh Wheadon. <br />The movie Serenity is in production now with a release date of 22April2005. <br />The Firefly DVD set is a must own with some of the very best stories Television has ever produced.
B0002234LS|4.0|After I saw 'Dreamcathcer', I thought I would never see another Stephen King-influenced film. But I did. And I wasn't disappointed. 'Secret Window', contrary to all pre-conceptions, satisfies the audience.<br />The film starts rather slowly. One morning, a man dressed fully in black knocks on Depp's door. He claims that Depp stole his story, accusing him with plagiarism. Though he seems to be extraordinarily serious about this. Indeed, he is. Things start happening, and Depp thinks that he needs to do something, before this mad guy kills him for a reason other than plagiarism, which he can't comprehend.<br />The film's end is a big surprise, and I think you won't be able to guess it beforehand. But, after seeing the end, I just smiled, and bowed before King's genius.<br />Not a masterpiece, but still a good movie that you can get engaged with, and have a good time.
B000066I6N|5.0|The music is rich in sound and makes you want to wear headphones at night with no distractions. I recently started playing all my older Plant CDs and then found this one at the store and was BLOWN AWAY. Yes it's mainly cover songs but the production values are well worth the listen, and he does justice to Dylan's One More Cup of Coffee from the Desire album (my fave Dylan album). Morning Dew is a sad but beautifully done song, and Plant's interpretation of Hey Joe is quite different from the one we're used to ala Hendrix but if listened to on its own merits it is still very good, relying more on Plant's voice to build it up with the music mainly keeping the beat and rhythm until the lengthy bridge section then it goes very Led Zeppelin. All in all an excellent CD well worth taking time away from everyone and dusting off that big old set of headphones you may have laying around somewhere.
B000002H33|5.0|I am a fan of old Metallica, even though I still like the newer stuff.  No album made by any band in this genre compares to 'Puppets'.  This album is a masterpiece from start to finish.<BR>This album followed the old metallica formula of starting off with a heavy song (Battery), having a 'Slower' song, (Sanitarium), having an instrumental (Orion) and ending with a blisteringly fast but incredible song (Damage,Inc.).   The title track of this album I think is Metallica's best song and excuse enough to get this album.<BR>   From start to finish, this album is nothing short of genius.  Sadly, this is the last album with late bassist, Cliff Burton.     <BR>    As in previous Metallica albums, this album deals with some serious topics as only Metallica can.  The power of Cliff Burton's bass, Lars Ulrich's drums, and the dueling Axe work of James Hetfield and Kirk Hammett make a powerful backdrop for James Hetfield's Raw but powerful vocals and the serious topics they convey.<BR>   This album was produced by Flemming Rasmusen, who produced previous works.  Rasmusen in my opinion, was the only one who captured Metallica's brilliance properly and put it on disk.  Although Bob Rock makes powerful albums, I think Rasmusen is a much better fit with metallica.<BR>   No written description will convince you that this is Metallica's best work more then just listening to it.  One listen to this album and you will agree.  Master of Puppets is in a class of it's own and will always be one of the best albums made.
B00005AQE8|5.0|All Eyez On Me is a really good cd. I found the cd inspiring and it influenced me to write lyrics of my own, because of its great tracks. On this one theres alot of songs that made it on the Greatest Hits cd, like &quot;Life Goes on&quot;, &quot;2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted&quot; featuring Snoop Dogg, and &quot;How Do U Want It&quot; featuring Jojo of Kci and Jojo, and theres also alot more. And to me this is his best cd. It has good beats mixed by producers like Johnny J,Dr.Dre even produced one song called &quot;Cant C Me&quot;, and great lyrics by the legendary Tupac Amaru Shakur.
B0000DC13U|1.0|My rating is a big fat zreo. The Stones fiddle around with the song off and on but never really get it going. Brian Jones is all<br />but invisable. The social commentary that is interspersed throughout was probably cool at some point in time but I've seen it all come and go. My remote was working, and I used it a lot.<br />I'm still looking for something really good by the Stones on DVD, VHS whatever and have yet to find it. I saw them in 1971 and they were decent but didn't really leave that much of an impression as a live band.
B00005JMEW|4.0|This movie is definetly not one you would want your kids to see, but it was funny and bloody at the same time.  It was interesting to see the take on how people look when their body parts are cut off.  There were arms, legs, and blood flying everywhere!!  It kept me interested throughout, although I'm glad they didn't release it as a 6 hour movie since I was starting to get tired towards the end. I am looking forward to the next volume and can't wait until it's released to find out how it ends or what happens before it ends :)
0783235380|3.0|Forces of Nature starts out as a fun romantic comedy, but as much fun as it was to watch Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock have a good time, I couldn't help being disapointed with Ben Affleck's character. Both he and his fiance, Maura Tierney were tempted to cheat on each other, except Ben's fiance's conscience holds her back, while only timing holds back Ben. I felt bad for Maura Tierney's character. She trusted her fiance and he let her down, and yet there was a happy ending for all. Well, all but those watching the film.
0060537639|5.0|This is an excellent rendition on the early explorations of the<br />Chinese around the globe. Under the leadership of Zhu Di,<br />worldwide travel flourished in China. Advanced concepts of<br />Maritime Engineering were implemented. Chinese seafarers<br />ate fish and Oolong tea. The explorations began in China and<br />traversed India, the Far East, Africa, the Falkland Islands and<br />Australia. For the first time, the DNA of the American Indians<br />contained diseases which originated in China. The Maize<br />plant was unknown in China previous to an explorer named &quot;He&quot;.<br />Zhou Man's fleet reached Australia as evidenced by numerous<br />fortresses in the general area. Chinese records dating back to<br />1430 showed illustrations of &quot;Strange Countries&quot;.  There are many<br />beautiful pictures in full color. Spectacular shots of<br />Antartica are depicted, as well as numerous maps of the Old World. This book has a wide constituency of readers including<br />historians, teachers, students, political scientists and a considerable general readership. The work would be perfect<br />for a student project in World History/Culture. This rendition<br />provides a rare perspective on China in the 14th and 15th centuries. Just the pictures alone are worth the price of the volume. The author's<br />perspective is unusual. In many ways, it rewrites the history<br />of the period. There are sporadic factual patterns to support<br />the contention that the Chinese were early travellers to the<br />new world. The findings of this author will require more<br />investigation and authentication by historians. In the interim,<br />the presentation will continue to fascinate readers and<br />contradict fairly well known and established facts on the<br />history of the new world.
B00004XONN|5.0|I'm not going to say that Kid A is the best radiohead cd, but it's my favorite.  I decided this while I listened to it in its uninterrupted glory during a two hour late night walk through suburbia with my dog.  It is an experience; this album and Amnesiac are the ones you have to hear all the way through in one go because it's hard to appreciate most of the tracks by themselves, because they don't really make sense in small pieces.  If someone played you treefingers or in limbo by itself you might not remember what they sounded like afterwards at all.<BR>But it's hard to describe the experience.  Everything in its Right Place is probably my favorite radiohead song ever.  It defines the mood.  Verse chorus verse does not exist starting now; Thom Yorke will mumble into his vocoder or whatever and then repeat short lines over and over in the songs where you can understand him (besides national anthem and morning bell).  The acoustic songs like national anthem, optimistic and limbo are kind of uneventful because they really just float in the air for a while.  Kid A and Treefingers are little more than atmosphere pieces, and Idioteque is an atmosphere piece with an unexpected club beat.  Morning Bell, possibly the only &quot;real&quot; song on the cd, is kind of quietly intense, even more intense than the screaming horns and raging bassline in national anthem.  And just when you thought it was all over, Motion Picture Soundtrack confuses you beyond all rational limits (there are even harps and a long long silence in the middle) and does something indescribable to your soul if you're really immersed in the music.  It probably makes more sense under the influence of illegal chemical substances, so i've heard, but it takes a lot of patience and almost no expectations to have the love for this music that I have.<BR>But to clear things up this is NOT A ROCK ALBUM by any stretch of the imagination.  There are NO HOOKS and NO SINGLES or anything.  It is about as abtruse and intentionally inscrutable as anything radiohead has done up to this point, so tread carefully.
B00006FDCJ|5.0|The most important aspect of this &quot;Western&quot; is its philospical and spiritual message about the universal condition of man. It is almost biblical in nature like the first chapters of the book of Romans in the New Testament. Man is aware of both good and evil but finally is caught up in evil and unless he is redeemed by the forgivness of God he will die in his sins. The title is very appropriate as the characters in the end are unforgiving and unforgiven. It is a powerful film in that there are certain aspects in the various characters the show they have a sense of what is good but they are unable of themselves to overcome the innate evil of the human heart. There are several classic lines in the film such as the moment the young gunslinger says to Eastwood's character &quot;He has it coming&quot; and the reply is &quot;We all have it coming&quot; The conclusion at the end is that both the man representing the law and the man representing the lawless are both damned. It is not a pretty picture of mankind but a true one and is the reason why the Son of God had to die on the cross that we might be forgiven. There is Evil in man, but goodness in God if we will turn to Him. If this film would have only included the forgiveness of God I would have given it twice five stars.
B00005B4GU|5.0|Pyramid Song is one of the most quietly beautiful songs EVER.<BR>That being said, I find the rest of this album slightly harder to understand as a single unit than Kid A, which cannot be touched or repeated even though these songs were made at the same time.  Maybe that's because this album really just doesn't fit together as well, although many of the songs have textures which Kid A made familiar.  There are songs that stand out, like the last one, the reworking of Morning Bell, and Dollars &amp; Cents (which really had to grow on me), and Pulk/Pull Revolving doors.  I really like You and Whose Army because it kind of looks forward to we suck young blood, the way it crescendos.  Spinning Plates is cool and trippy and Sardines in a Crushd Tin Box is very calm and well constructed; in short, all the electronic songs are well done.  But the other rock tracks: I Might Be Wrong and Knives Out, are pretty good, but feel lacking somehow in placement or maybe they just aren't as great because they've kind of been done before, or maybe my instinct is wrong.<BR>It's like Kid A was made for the middle of the night and Amnesiac was made for facing dawn, with bits of the past still lingering and affecting the present but everything having a different tint to it and being a little bit easier to do.  Amnesiac is not Kid A part two, it's more like Kid A's brother.  With each Radiohead album, it gets harder to categorize them in relation to their predecessors, so just listen to it and see what you think.
B00000DLVA|5.0|This is a 1998 release from this Swedish band (so much Underrated in US). <BR>The happiness and fun that was present on their previous 1996 release &quot;First Band on the Moon&quot; is gone. This album is definitely Darker and Colder in sound. It is more Trip Hop and has more Electronica elements in it.<br />But is this album still Great? Hell Yeah!!! Cardigans changed their style, and yet managed to come up with a Great album. The melodies of the songs are still Extremely catchy and well-developed. There is a lof of Emotion and Melody here.<br />Peter Svensson wrote all the melodies on this CD and Nina wrote lyrics, and they did an Excellent job!<br />Most songs here are slower and mellow (but the catchy melodies never bore you), with the exceptioon of the amazing faster-paced &quot;My Favorite Game&quot;, which is similar to Roxette style dance-rock.<br />Every single song on this CD is Great, with Nina Persson's Great vocals. Her vocals are just so relaxing; you can't help but drown yourself in them.<br />Cardigans do an Amazing job of mixing Electronica with Rock on this album. Great sound. If you like Morcheeba or Dido, than you will Love this album, this is maybe even Better.<br />But generally, if you like high quality Pop music that's very Melodic, than this is a Great buy for you. It's simply PERFECT.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I would like to start off by saying that I generally hate radiohead fans, generally for the same reason I hate miles davis fans.  Radiohead is God's gift to modern rock or whatever you want to call it, they are musical geniuses that still manage to appeal to millions of people, most of whom are to myopic to see all the good points in a wide spectrum of work.  This was the first radiohead cd I ever bought, although by now I have heard all the lps.  Stop trying to say whether this one or the bends is the best, because they're both awesome.  In the bends they were saying hey, we're not immature one hit wonders, we're good.  With ok computer they're saying we're going to be different whether you like it or not.  The Bends was a barrage of perfect songs (like a tribe called quest's midnight marauders, for those of you enlightened enough to know what I'm talking about), but OK Computer is a brilliant departure from the expected.  Jazz musicians keep on covering Paranoid Android and Exit Music because they identify with the experimental but unyieldingly effective nature of the music.<BR>Airbag is a banging opener, but Paranoid Android is a trip.  The different pieces of it fit together, and the time signature shifts only add to the forceful element of the song.  The Homesick Alien song is nice and dreamy and Exit Music is even more beautiful and is a great emotional climactic deal.  I didn't like Let Down at first but it's a nice simmer and a bridge.  Karma Police is irresistible.  Fitter Happier is NOT A FILLER TRACK give it a chance it's a well written social commentary.  Electioneering is very loud but it's got energy.  The rest of the songs are very slow and thick with slightly unusual instruments and they are all very pretty and ironic and angry and spacious and they are more what separates radiohead from its past than the first portion of the album.<BR>I like this album because unlike the bends, which is a great rock album, ok computer is a great album, and it's great art.  Thom Yorke and Co take their time and do things their way and end up with something very meaningful and easy to relate to, whether observed by seasoned musicians or die hard rock fans or whoever you are.  It has an permanent place in the canon of enduring music from the 90s.
B00005NNMK|5.0|Joey Tempest, Mic Michaeli, John Norum, John Leven, Ian Haugland. <BR>Wasn't Europe's first LP, but certainly the one to propel them into worldwide commercial success in 1986, and for a good reason.<br />There is NOT a single bad song on this CD!! Joey Tempest (real name Joakim Larsson) wrote all the songs; and his ability to come up with a Catchy Commercial Pop tune is simply incredible. And he came up with 10 for this album. Yeah, all 10 are perfect and powerful songs, and nothing less.<br />The songs are Catchy, Melodic, Emotional, Polished, Smooth, Powerful, and Energetic. They hit you hard in that way. It's nearly impossible to single out any song or group of songs as being &quot;the best&quot;. They are All 100% Potential Hits, capable of shooting straight to the top of charts. All have Unforgettable and Powerful melodies that you will sing in your head for a very long time. And the repeat button, well it becomes your Best friend. <br />Of course this album features the well-known &quot;Final Countdown&quot; with that Unforgettable Intro to it. And of course there is the Power Ballad &quot;Carrie&quot;. But the other 8 songs are in no way worse. They will send you flying with their Powerful and Catchy choruses.<br />Amazing CD. Swedes truly know how to write those perfect harmonies! This is pure ear candy from track 1 to track 10..... plus the 3 bonus Live versions on this CD.
B000092ZYX|5.0|There is a point as a musician where you stop experimenting with new things and do what you know how to do as well as you can possibly do it.  Radiohead is a mature band now, and I would compare this album's mood to the Bends more than anything after that because it takes what has already been done and just squeezes all the possibilities out into what may be their most finely tuned album yet.  They are using thier minor failures of the past to make sure there are no missteps here; in other words, structurally, this album pretends Kid A and Amnesiac never happened.  The electronic aspect has not been discarded, however, but even in the IDM tracks, Thom Yorke says more than he's said since OK Computer.  I think his lyrics are better than they've ever been, and the musical aspect of the songwriting is in top form as well.  The key is that, even though the thematic and political element of this album is like OK Computer, each track is in perfect balance with itself, just like the Bends, but this time there is so much more to work with.<BR>2+2=5 is sure to become another of their classic openers, going from a melancholy 7/4 lament to a screaming frustrated rock song that keeps changing.  Sit Down Stand Up is hypnotic and unusual, and the rest of the album is dynamite, never repeating itself (like Kid A and Amnesiac did), and having emotions that range from quiet ballads (I Will, Sail to the Moon) to unexpected and very loud techno bits (Myxomatosis).  The atmosphere is impeccable on tracks like We Suck Young Blood and perfectly ironic on songs like A Wolf at the Door.  I cannot repeat that whether you like every song or not, there is little you could do to improve on any aspect of any of them.  No matter when you started listening to radiohead, or whether you never started, this may be their finest work.
B000023VR6|5.0|this cd is wayyy better than chronic. a must-buy! songs 5-11 are my favorites.
B00008EY65|5.0|Yes, finally a good movie out there like Spiderman 2. Hellboy is a movie that cannot be missed because it has every good ingredient that a movie needs to have in order to be great. This movie has action beyond anyone's wildest dreams and it has love, awesome costumes, and a totally great script. It is one of the greatest movie ever made and I give it 10 stars! See it!

0141439661|4.0|In Sense and Sensible the storyline dwells on the two elder sisters of the Dashwood family, Elinor and Mariane.  Elinor is always in control of her emotions and is governed primarily by prudence (sense). Her younger sister, Marianne, is an emotional whirlwind whose sensibilities dictate that those who do not evidence wholly encompassing emotions are without them entirely.  As in Pride &amp; Prejudice, the family home of the Dashwoods has been willed to another member of the family not in the immediate nuclear family.  In Pride &amp; Prejudice, the home was entailed to Mr. Collins, a distant cousin.  Where there was only an overshadowing of the loss of the estate in that book, in Sense &amp; Sensibility, the house is actually lost to the half brother whose wife, a Ferrar, not only talks her husband out of the generous support to his half sisters that he promised (albeit vaguely) his dying father but makes life in general unpleasant for the Dashwood ladies until they find a situation with a cousin, John Middleton.  Part of the unpleasantness surrounds an apparent but unprofessed affection of her brother, Edward Ferrars, for the eldest Dashwood, Elinor.<br />It would seem that the move has quashed the supposed attraction, leaving Elinor attempting to contain her disappointment.  Marianne meanwhile strikes up an intense relationship with equally extroverted Willoughby.  When Willoughby suddenly disappears, the two girls come together to support each other emotionally through a storm of discoveries, pleasant and unpleasant.<br />Sense and Sensibility develops into its own independent storyline after many similarities with Pride &amp; Prejudice.  Although this novel holds its own and is an enjoyable book, I still feel that Pride &amp; Prejudice is its superior in pace, story line and general feel. Sense came out well before Pride and it almost feels that the same idea is being worked out in both - an idea that got clearer and was better communicated in Pride. Pride had a much more natural (believable) feeling to the events where Sense does require a little suspension of disbelief in some of the contrivances to get to a happy ending (specifically referring to the actions of Robert Ferrar).  If you liked Pride and want more Austen, this is your book.  If you are choosing between the two, choose Pride ... than come back for this one.much more natural (believable) feeling to the events where Sense does require a little suspension of disbelief in some of the contrivances to get to a happy ending (specifically referring to the actions of Robert Ferrar).

B00000ING2|1.0|This is one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. I wish I could give the movie a  rating of zero stars, but that isn't an option. I just got through watching &quot;The Sword of the Valiant&quot;, it was so bad it made me smile. &quot;The Hudsucker Proxy&quot; is so bad it made me groan. I couldn't wait for it to end. It was pure torture, I expected a lot better from Tim Robbins, Paul Newman, and Jennifer Jason Leigh. I would just burn the DVD, but maybe I can find someone who will be as taken by this movie as all the other people who gave it glowing reviews, maybe one of them would be willing to give me the $15 I paid for this turkey.
B000001IQH|4.0|rancid is a cool band but this album made them seem like there fading away but we can still listen 2 10 or 11 good songs on this album
B0002DKCMG|1.0|What a waste of time this one was! From start to finish you get a stream of sexual innuendo, implied sex, the word f--k used more often than in most R movies, not very much good about it.<BR>Smallville's Kristin Kreuk has a short segment in the beginning- don't expect Lana Lang here- if this is the best movie role she can get her career is already over, Lucy Lawless is the Dutch operator of a sex shop- another career killer, Michelle Tractenberg had the best female role- I'll take Dawn Summers any day.<BR>This little gem managed to insult everything from British Soccer Hooligans (& that would take some doing although Vinnie Jones did a mostly reasonable job in his role), to nude beaches and gay men ( fat older nude men, the nude women were only topless but younger & in better shape), eastern Europe (the exchange rate is not THAT good, and the people are smarter than shown). I wouldn't have had the nerve to take on the Vatican & the Pope the way this movie did (not very funny). Did they actually get permission to use Frommer's travel guide by name? If I was Arthur Frommer, I hope that wasn't really him in one scene, I would want nothing to do with this mess. Definitely not one to buy even if you do want to see breasts, buttocks and male genitals (but never female).
B00003CXPJ|3.0|Beneath its ridiculous surface, &quot;Zoolander&quot; is a whip-smart look at one of the stupidest parts of our increasingly stupid culture, namely the world of fashion.  Taking a break from his now-standard neurotic-nerd persona, Ben Stiller mugs furiously and often as legendary male model Derek Zoolander, who's sure to go down as one of the most indelible movie characters of the past few years.  Derek has a repertoire of looks that have different names but all appear the same, and he's so stupid and shallow that he mangles almost any word with more than two syllables and thinks bulimia is the ability to read minds.  The movie sees him searching for some meaning in his life beyond being &quot;really, really good-looking,&quot; a search that's interrupted when he unwittingly becomes involved in a top-secret fashion-industry plot to assassinate the prime minister of Malaysia.  If you think all this sounds bizarre, that's because it is.  But that doesn't mean it's not funny.<br />Given its subject matter, it makes sense for &quot;Zoolander&quot; to be heavy on stupid humor, and it doesn't disappoint.  &quot;Zoolander&quot; starts out over the top, and stays there.  This movie throws everything it can think of at you, and some of it sticks, and some doesn't.  It's that simple.  Everything here is calculated for maximum absurdity, be it Stiller's near-microscopic phone, the ultra-lame '80's soundtrack, or the hairdos and outfits worn by just about everybody (most notably Will Ferrell and Jerry Stiller).  Among the more inspired ideas are a &quot;walk-off&quot; between Zoolander and his rival Hansel; a surprisingly intelligent bit that takes off on the Stanley Kubrick classic &quot;2001;&quot; and of course the Derek Zoolander Center for Kids Who Can't Read Good.  All in all, this movie has a more than ample supply of laughs crammed into its 89 minutes.  While too many movies these days seem to be unaware of their stupidity, &quot;Zoolander&quot; positively revels in it, and even for that reason alone it would be worth watching., and even for that reason alone it would be worth watching.
B00004XOWM|4.0|This is the first album that i had heard from Limp way back in 2002. I liked it then and i still do now. Check out the list of Guest artists/ producers on this one. You have DMX, Xzibit on &quot;Getcha Groove On&quot;, Scott Weiland of Stone Temple Pilots on &quot;Hold On&quot; and on co-production. You have Method Man and Red Man from the Wu-Tang fame dropping rhymes on &quot;Rollin' (Urban Assault)&quot; and you have Terry Date and Josh Abraham lining up at the production end. You also find movie star Ben Stiller interviewing Limp Bizkit on the outro, which turns out to be Ben laughing for like 6 minutes straight. This is an awesome follow-up to the style that Limp Bizkit established in their prior effort &quot;Significant Other&quot;. Wes Borland the guitarist is one of the best and he's certainly on a roll on this record. The lyrics sound repetative but Fred Durst is either simply brilliant like on &quot;The One&quot; and &quot;Hold On&quot; or just plain stupid like on &quot;Hot Dog&quot;. The Rhythm development from Drummer John Otto and Bassist Sam Rivers is brilliant all around especially significant on songs like &quot;Hold On&quot;, &quot;The One&quot;, &quot;Boiler&quot;, &quot;Take a Look Around&quot; and others. DJ Lethal is awesome with sampling rather than scratching on most of the album. The all-song review:<BR>01 Intro -- not so impressive.<BR>02 Hot Dog -- Heavy and low on lyrical content.<BR>03 My Generation -- Only impressive point is the Bridge build-up.<BR>04 Full Nelson -- Kinda Heavy.<BR>05 My Way -- Nice Guitarwork and Sampling only.<BR>06 Rollin' (Air Raid) --  The Original bouncy track.<BR>07 Livin' It Up -- Bad lyrical content, good basslines.<BR>08 The One -- The Best Godamn song on the entire record!<BR>09 Getcha Groove On -- With DMX and Xzibit, nice Hip-Hop.<BR>10 Take A Look Around -- The Mission: Impossible 2 soundtrack.<BR>11 It'll Be Ok -- Hauntingly good guitarwork, once again.<BR>12 Boiler -- Brilliant Guitar, Bass and Drum work! <BR>13 Hold On -- with Scott Weiland, Brilliant Guitar and Drumming.<BR>14 Rollin' (Urban Assault) -- with Method Man, Red Man and DMX.<BR>15 Outro -- similar to intro with Ben Stiller, waste of time.<br />That's it folks, hope my review was useful. This is a list of all Limp Bizkit albums:<BR>01 $3 Bill Y'all (1997) -- Pure madness and heavy and noisy and all crazy things combined. It kicks ass, except at the recording quality end. You'll never hear a record like this!<br />02 Significant Other (1999) -- The agression is still there, but they found good quality production and a deeper goal. Featuring Method Man of Wu-Tang Clan, Jonathan Davis of koRn, Scott Weiland of Stone Temple Pilots.<br />03 Chocolate Starfish and The Hotdog Flavored Water (2001) -- See Above.<br />04 New Old Songs (2002) -- Remix album of best of Limp songs from the previous 3 albums. Watered down and sometimes downright boring. Features The Neptunes, Josh Abraham, Everlast, Timbaland, Bubba Sparxx, Bosko, DJ Premier, William Orbit and others.<br />05 Results May Vary (2003) -- Departure of Guitarist Wes Borland opens up way for new guitarist Mike Smith. This is softer and much more deeper album and something Limp never did before. No annoying Intro/ Outros, better lyrical content and use of softer guitarwork and melodious vocals. Features Snoop Dogg.<br />That's it!
B00006SFLV|5.0|I'm 21 now and so I was only about 12 or 13 when My so called life originally aired. I LOVED it then and I even love it even more now.The character's are much more easier to relate to  than any of the other &quot;teen&quot; shows out there, now and then !!(O.C now and Beverly Hills 90210 then) Everything Angela went through,you could relate to even then when I was 12 I could relate and now even after highschool I still love it i'm just sad it got taken off the air so soon. To anyone who enjoys a good show that's not all about Big houses and lots of money I recommend this series!!!!!!!!

B00009W0U4|5.0|There are two sides to &quot;Irreversible&quot;. The first one is violent and disturbing, the second one beautiful and romantic. Since all reviewers from this forum chose the first one, I shall write about the second part of the film, which is beyond greatness. There is a party scene and a subway one that would make any film buff more than happy. And then there is a beautiful and tender love scene between Bellucci and Cassel.<br />The film is told backwards, ergo, the audience knows the characters' destiny. It's so sad to see them having such a great time together -- laughing and dancing, not knowing how their lives will be forever altered. This is great cinema. Monica Bellucci's performance is incredible -- I can't think of any actress (especially one from Hollywood) who would have accepted to play such a difficult part. Vincent Cassel (he did the voice of Robin Hood in Shrek) and Albert Duponteil are equally good. The whole movie is shot in single-take scenes, most of the dialogue being improvised by these great actors. The film has been directed by Gaspar Noe (Seul Contre Tous) and he brings us his unique vision to the material. The sountrack and the special effects are excellent, too. <br />If you haven't yet seen &quot;Irreversible&quot; and you have reservations regarding the violent content -- here's a tip for you: watch the second half of the film (where the party scene begins) and then judge for yourself if you want to see what's left out of this complex tragedy. Everybody knows that good and bad co-exist together. &quot;Irreversible&quot; has such a fresh and realistic look to life that in less than a year will probably become a classic.
B00008DDRX|2.0|Make no mistake: This is NOT a movie! I'm rating it two stars not because it's bad. It's just because this is almost a doccumentary, not a movie. There is absolutely NO acting, no dialogues. The few times the cast open their mouths arwe for some contrieved and dull dialogues (although they do their best clearly). The movie is an endless line of cars chasing cars and chasing cars. If you're an auto-racing fan (like myself), it's clear you'll enjoy the sequences. But, if you are not biased, you'll notice clearly why this movie bombed at the box office.<br />It's not a bad movie at all!! It's a GREAT Movie. But, unfortunately, it has no actor nor dialogues.
B000002JOH|5.0|I have recently purchased this album, and i dont regret it. It one of the best metal albums of all time. I have also recently discovered this band, this cd got me into them. My favorite songs are mouth for war and walk. Go buy this album right away.
B0000DJZ7W|5.0|Whenever people criticize me for being a Cline Dion fan, I always tell them to listen to her in French because it is so much better than her English recordings.  While I like many of those as well, 1 Fille &amp; 4 Types is of the same quality as D'eux and S'il Suffisait D'Aimer.  The melodic quality and intimacy of these recordings really makes her vocals shine without the overblown aspects people tend to dislike in her English songs.  Give it a try!
B00005AQE8|5.0|I love this album, i think cd 2 is better than 1, but its all good. 2pac is one of my favorite rappers and i got to say this is his masterpiece. If you are going to buy any 2pac album i suggest you buy this or any of his other alive ones, his dead ones are good but his alive ones are the way he wanted them to be so they are the best, buy this or thug life volume 1. All the songs are good.
055357342X|5.0|I just wanted to add that this series is awe-inspiring and shockingly realistic for the genre of fantasy. The characters are given depth and perspective through different viewpoints, leaving the reader with mixed feelings on whether they are &quot;good&quot; or not, and whether they should be pitied or condemned. These books have given me many sleepless nights because I was so engrossed in the Song of Ice and Fire, and when I finally had to put down the book I was kept up the rest of the night worrying about my favorite characters' fate. I have fallen in love with several characters and even though I have finished all three (and wait impatiently for the forth) I cannot seem to get the story from my mind and am drawn back to reread it again and again. These books are rewarding, exciting, and allow you to be swept away into a place that is not only magical in a literal sense, but in that it captures your soul.
B0001AP12G|5.0|(...) great lyrics, awesome beats, damn...just great man....Tracks like \\"jesus walks\\" \\"through the wire\\" \\"we dont care\\" \\"two words\\" oh my god......how can someone make such great music???...get it now(...)
B00004R99M|5.0|Mary Poppins is my favorite movie. I love the charictors, the singing, the dancing. It is fun for the whole family. When I was alittle girl I watched it over and over again. I love to dance with the chimeny sweeps; I can't do everything they do, but still. This is the best master piece Walt Disney ever created besides Micky and friends. I love it and I am a teen.<br />It is about a fun nanny who has magic. That is probobly why I like her. There is never a dull moment when Mary Poppins is around: fox hunting, laughing in the air, riding a merry-go-round without the going arout. One of the best parts of all, supercalafagilisticexpialadocious.
B00008FBDE|3.0|I must admit that when I saw Stargate, I was amazed at the then incredible graphics.  The storyline itself was rather unique and piqued my interest since I often marveled at the history of ancient Egypt and the Great Pyramid.<br />Nevertheless, although being an entertaining flick, I certainly don't think it's worth $1,918.98 list price even WITH the free shipping.  It's not even in DVD format!<br />Save your money and just wait for it to be televised again on TNT.
B000056QE5|5.0|I love this CD! It is a collection of master pieces by the Sherman brothers. The music is fun to dance to and is a great way to brighten up your day. I love turning on my CD player and listening to Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke sing thier hearts out. This is my favorite album in my collection. It is fun for the whole family wheather you are a baby or a teen or an adult or a senior. I am a teen and I LOVE it.
B00008FBDE|3.0|I must admit that when I first saw this movie, I marveled at the then incredible effects and cinematography.  It involved a story that was unique and piqued my interest as I've often marveled at the civilizations of ancient Egypt and the Great Pyramid.<br />Altho I did thuroughly enjoy this flick, I certainly don't think it's worth the $1,918.98 list price even WITH the free shipping.  It's not even the DVD format version!<br />All in all, save your money and wait for it to be shown on the TNT network again.
