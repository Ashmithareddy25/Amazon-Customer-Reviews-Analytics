B00004U8JV|5.0|Loved the darker tone and humor and always was a fan of Golblum's character so a flick that focuses on him was quite welcome. Not as ground breaking as the first flick but is still a great thriller. It is also a bit quirkier than the first but I liked that added dimension, although I can also understand how that might be polarizing to some.
B00008438V|5.0|My daughter and I have this thing we do where we just pop off with a movie quote and then ask...\\"Movie?\\" and the other has to tell what movie it is from. We definitely got a lot of good quotes from Weird Science. This was a classic 80's movie that can be watched again and again. I can't wait to get it and have a good old-fashioned 80's movie & popcorn night!
B000Q6GX5Y|3.0|I love this movie but like the title says it is not true Blu-Ray quality and thats why it is getting 3 stars.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great heroine.  Fantastic concept.  Heart pounding tale.  There are tons of storyline reviews already, so I won't repeat them, but I will say that if you haven't yet tasted this trilogy, that you try this book out with as few spoilers as possible.  I knew one major thing about the ending that took a bit of the tension out of the last third of the book.  But you know what?  Still five stars, even with the spoiler.  An excellently crafted tale.
B001HN6918|4.0|I loved the first Kung Fu Panda because it was unique, unlike anything I had seen before. When I heard there was going to be a second one, I was a bit leery-- sequels are hardly ever as good as the originals, so why should this one be different? But I was proved wrong, and glad to be!<br /><br />What makes this sequel so amazing is its almost seemless continuation of the first story, but also with so much new information added. All the original voices (as far as I know) came back to reprise their roles, which always helps. And we get to learn about the inner layers of a few of the characters as well. (Getting to know someone on a deeper level always makes things more interesting.) All in all, it was an excellent movie that could easily stand on its own, but the fact that it's a sequel makes this achievement even better!
B002ZG997M|5.0|Really thoughful storyline.  Strong religious overtones -- basically a futuristic tale about how the Bible becomes the most sought after book on earth after a war which leads to the destruction of most of humankind.    As usual, Denzel Washington is great as the star with Gary Oldman cast as the perfect authoritarian villain.  The future is not pretty as cannibalism, rape, rampant crime, gangs, dominate the new world that emerges after the war.  But the movie ends on a hopeful note.  Better than I expected.
1603420398|5.0|I LOVE THIS BOOK, I TAKE IT EVERYWHERE I GO. THE MOTIFS ARE FUN & EASY TO MAKE  THE MODERN STYLES ARE COOL. SHE DOES A VERY GOOD JOB SHOWING YOU HOW TO MAKE THEM, EASY TO UNDERSTAND.  WHEN WILL YOU BE DOING ANOTHER BOOK,...SOON I HOPE  THANKS FOR ALL THE FUN
B001AQT0OU|5.0|I have quite a few classic films on Blu-Ray....................I think The Searchers and Barry Lyndon look the best.....................The existing light scenes are breathtakingly beautiful.  The film is not my favorite Kubrick;  Ryan O'Neal is pretty wooden in the part, but I guess Stanley Kubrick got the best he could from him...................The adaptation of Thackeray's The Luck of Barry Lyndon is just OK......................Thackeray is my favorite 19th century writer, and this film misses the biting satire of the novel.  The 5 stars is for the photography, sets, and costumes.................this is one of the best looking films ever.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Quit heffing around Lucas. Want the original trilogy; only changes to allow for HD. I miss the ewok village ending :(
B0027BOL4G|4.0|I need to watch this again, since I kept falling asleep during the movie, but what an eye opener it is!  I haven't had a fast food hamburger in almost a year because of this movie and believe me, being overweight, I really appreciate anything that can turn me away from fast food!  The memory is getting dim, so I plan to watch it again this week to gross myself out all over again!  I'm sure there is something I missed that might turn me away from other goodies I don't need to consume!
B004K4AUZW|1.0|I am so disappointed!  The title track of this CD skips like crazy.  I should have purchased it at a local store.  What is my recourse now?  I have never had this type of problem from Amazon!
B000SXOI66|5.0|If you're 12 years old and you haven't heard of Dark Side of the Moon, buy it immediately. Do everyone a favor and save yourself from the rap and crap that is making our youth stupid.
B004O0TKWG|4.0|I bought the 2011 EMI release (I noticed that they merged the reviews from the 2007 Collectables release with the 2011 EMI release)of this 2 album set, and I really liked the mastering/production of these two albums. They aren't remastered, but they still have a nice clear clean sound to them and the tracks on \\"City to City\\" aren't slightly sped up on the single 1988 EMI album release. I don't know what some of the reviewers were listening to when they were saying things like they heard hissing or the tracks didn't line up properly (they might have fixed that in the 2011 release). The only thing that I didn't really like was that there is really nothing in the booklet. It is 4 pages and it includes the 2 albums next to each other (as shown above, on the front), page 2 contains the album artwork to \\"City to City\\" with the red border around it, page 3 is \\"Night Owl\\" artwork with red border and the back (page 4) is the track listings (as shown on back). There are some nice pictures on the vinyl releases and some important liner notes that they missed. Well I hope that United Artists someday re-releases all of his album remastered and with pictures and liner notes. This release has a great sound it is just missing some printed information.
B002BJGYV2|5.0|I can't believe how overpriced every other site is that sells \\" discounted\\" dvd's.  I bought this new for 1/3 the price elsewhere.    Gilmore Girls is one of those series you can watch many times and always see something new and hilarious.
0811875040|5.0|[[ASIN:0811875040 Miette: Recipes from San Francisco's Most Charming Pastry Shop]] is one of the prettiest books it has been my pleasure to come across.  While there are not a huge number of recipes (more is not always better), the recipes that are included cover a wide and very well chosen spectrum.  Among the goodies I was delighted to find were both homemade graham crackers and the wonderful chocolate wafers, now nearly unobtainable commercially, that were such a big part of my childhood.<br /><br />Perhaps the thing I liked best, though, was the scale of the recipes.  I love to bake, but now that I live alone a full-sized cake or pie is simply too much for me to consume.  Ray's recipes, however, are all scaled to small.  The cakes run to a mere six inches, the tarts to seven.  Her instructions are detailed and easy to follow, making this a book that newer bakers will enjoy using.  Highly recommended.<br /><br />PS - [[ASIN:0811875040 Miette: Recipes from San Francisco's Most Charming Pastry Shop]], together with a [[ASIN:B000NO7IOO Wilton Decorator Preferred 6 by 2 Inch Round Pan]] and a set of pretty pot holders would make a perfect bridal shower gift!<br /><br />One final note:  I've spent several hours searching high and low for 7-inch tart pans as specified in the book, to no avail.  While I did find a straight-sided version in silicon, I do not care for silicon bakeware.  On rereading the book, I find that Ray does state that the recipes have been tested for either 7 or 8 inch tart pans or 3.5 inch tartlet pans.  Here are a couple that would fit the bill -<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000NA0CFA Chicago Metallic Tartlett Pan 4 Cavity, 10.60-Inch by, 9.90-Inch by 1.30-Inch (3-1/2-Inch by .90 Cavities)]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000VJUJ24 Paderno World Cuisine 7.875 Inch Fluted Non-Stick Tart Pan with Removable Bottom]]
B001DUKHXQ|5.0|Thriller, on vinyl, on my little record player, ahhhh.  I love it!  This album brings back so many memories and the collector's edition is pleasing to the eyes.
B004UXXVQS|5.0|First I have to say that I am a big fan of the Foo Fighters.<br />I have to say I was a little skeptical about this album, when I heard they were recording it in a garage on tape.  I wasn't sure if the sound quality would be as good as some of the newer digital methods.  After listening to the cd, I was proved wrong. It almost seems more real, because digitizing and removing all the slight imperfections makes a lot of albums sound unnatural in my opinion.<br /><br />As for the songs themselves, they are a little \\"harder\\" than most of the previous albums.  It isn't that the songs are all all more intense than the more vigorous songs on the previous albums, but \\"Walk\\" is probably the closest thing to a ballad or a relaxed song, and it is still not by any means slow.<br /><br />\\"White Limo\\" is the hardest song on the album.  I do skip it if I am not in the right move, but if you like Motorhead, and similar bands, \\"White Limo\\" is your kind of song. The rest of the songs are just all around good.  Bridge Burning, and Back and Forth were instant favorites, and after a few plays, I really like all the songs on the album.
B00005NUZM|5.0|Off The Wall is with out a doubt,Michael Jackson's best album.I can listen to it from start to finish and not get bored like if i was listening to Thriller.Thriller had 2 good songs: PYT and Human Nature.Wanna be startin someting was crap and never liked it when it came out,Thriller was ok as well as Beat it and Billie Jean.Off the Wall had some GREAT SONGS on it,that i enjoy to this day.Don't Stop Till You Get Enough 5/5   Rock With You  5/5  Off The Wall 5/5   She's Out of My Life 5/5  Working Day and Night 5/5 Get on the Floor 5/5  Girlfriend 4/5  I can't help it 4/5 It's the falling in love 4.5/5 Burn the disco out 4/5  Great artist with awesome voice at it's peak.A must if u are a big Michael Jackson or u like music in general.A must buy.
B004WJREPO|5.0|MCCARTNEY II is an album that polarizes fans. Many think it's too weird and not enough of a \\"McCartney\\" record. Others, like me, think it shows Paul's experimental side in a batch of songs that are interesting and fun.<br /><br />For those who haven't heard MCCARTNEY II, I would not recommend the Deluxe Edition as your initial experience. Seek out \\"Coming Up\\" (the studio version, NOT Wings' live version), \\"Temporary Secretary\\" and \\"Waterfalls\\" and a few other songs on YouTube, and if you like them, buy the 2 CD set. For those fans who rank MCCARTNEY II among their favorite of his albums, though, the Deluxe Edition is a must.<br /><br />The first disc, the initial album, is remastered wonderfully. The sound is crisp and clear for the first time on CD. It really makes one appreciate the effort Paul went into in producing, engineering and recording this album--all done at home on a 16-track Studer machine, without help barring initial technical assistance from engineer Eddie Klein and a few backing vocals from Linda. The album is synth-heavy, which may turn fans off. Paul also experimented with his vocals, speeding them or slowing them and sometimes adding echo.<br /><br />\\"Waterfalls\\" and \\"One Of These Days\\" are probably the most McCartneyesque tracks. \\"Temporary Secretary\\", \\"Bogey Music\\" and \\"Darkroom\\" are probably the strangest. \\"Front Parlour\\" and \\"Frozen J**\\" (the title unrelated to his prison time; Amazon will not let me quote it here) are instrumentals. This is a record where no song sounds quite like the one before it.<br /><br />The bonus discs, unlike the MCCARTNEY Deluxe Edition, include quite a few outtakes and alternate takes. Originally, MCCARTNEY II was planned as a double album, but Columbia's record execs vetoed that idea. The bizarre \\"Check My Machine\\" (recorded to test his tape equipment) and the ethereal \\"Secret Friend\\" (a 10-minute long mostly instrumental number) were released as B-sides. Other numbers, like the instrumentals \\"Bogey Wobble\\" and \\"Blue Sway\\", are on Disc 2. The live version of \\"Coming Up\\" by Wings recorded at Glasgow also turns up there, with an additional verse. Unfortunately for completists, the intro and chanting at the end are cut out, and the track's been remixed. So don't throw out your 45s yet.<br /><br />\\"Mr. H Atom\\" is a piece of fluff sung by Paul and Linda; it's not that great, but it's amusing. \\"You Know I'll Get You Baby\\" recalls Prince's material on DIRTY MIND in terms of sound, not content; the entire song is the title line. Still, as a piece of New Wave pop, it rocks. \\"All You Horseriders\\" is one of Paul's silliest songs, but again, the background is pure late Seventies New Wave. For that, I love it. Finally, \\"Blue Sway\\" had orchestration added to it back in 1986, when Paul was considering its release on an outtakes record, COLD CUTS. That take, along with the original, is preserved here, and it sounds absolutely gorgeous, like a lost Police song.<br /><br />Disc 3 is more dispensable. It contains the original, \\"long\\" versions of songs that were cut down for MCCARTNEY II, such as \\"Coming Up\\", \\"Front Parlour\\" and \\"Frozen J**\\". The instrumentals aren't that interesting, but the longer versions of \\"Darkroom\\" and \\"Check My Machine\\" (nine minutes!) are even more alternative fun. \\"Wonderful Christmastime\\", however, isn't much improved with an extra 30 seconds or so. We also get a take of \\"Summer Day's Song\\" without the vocals added later; it's gorgeous. The disc ends with the DJ edit of \\"Waterfalls\\", for what that's worth.<br /><br />Finally, the DVD has an interview between McCartney and Tim Rice from 1980 which is moderately interesting, but not very revealing. The videos for \\"Coming Up\\", \\"Waterfalls\\" and \\"Wonderful Christmastime\\" are included; they don't look significantly improved from their appearance on THE MCCARTNEY YEARS. (\\"Christmastime\\" still looks pretty awful.) The video of \\"Coming Up\\" from Kampuchea is nice to have, but I wish they'd release the entire concert--not justPaul, but the Who, Pretenders et al as well. A rehearsal take of \\"Coming Up\\" by Wings in 1979 is fascinating. It reminded me of the LET IT BE sessions in that no one, even Paul, seems to be having any fun. Perhaps this is why Wings eventually broke up. Finally, the \\"Making of 'Coming Up'\\" video is way too short, but it's a great look into how that groundbreaking promo film came together, with some comments from Paul.<br /><br />The book is well worth the purchase price on its own. Chockfull of rare photos, with lots of technical details about the recording of the album from Paul, Eddie Klein and Richard Niles, who orchestrated \\"Blue Sway\\". Paul also tells a few fun stories about overdubbing, which I won't spoil here. We see photos of the other Wings members from the cover shoot for MCCARTNEY II, an alternate inside spread design, an interview originally published in Club Sandwich about the record, and full details on all the album tracks and videos. Beautifully done.<br /><br />One last bonus: All the tracks are available as digital downloads, limited and unlimited, from Paul's website. You can't play them on your iPods, though.<br /><br />Quibbles: I wish they'd left \\"Coming Up (Live at Glasgow)\\" alone. And where's the B-side of \\"Wonderful Christmastime\\", \\"Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reggae\\"? He didn't record it at home, but it belongs here. Well, it's not that great anyway.<br /><br />If you love MCCARTNEY II, you owe it to yourself to buy this edition. It's a keeper.
B003Y5H54W|1.0|Being a fan of Amanda Seyfried, I purchased this movie with some expectation that it would be a good movie.  Was I ever wrong.   The movie is garbage.   The plot has been done before.  The characters are one dimensional and not believable.  I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|Love this movie! I have the Firefly series as well, but think I may need to get it on Blu Ray too at some point, the quality is SO MUCH better!
B0015XHP4K|5.0|What a great Trilogy to have in Blu Ray. The Quality on these 3 discs in my opinion, is really great. I have the Trilogy on regular dvd. I won't be watching them anymore!!!  The clarity is excellent. You feel like you're in the jungle with him. If you are wondering whether to buy this in blu ray or not, go ahead & get it. You will be happy with the quality. I also got a really good price on Amazon. No complaints here.
0670022411|4.0|Yes, this is a romance, and yes it can be a bit airy. BUT, and I mean BUT if you like a fast paced, light, yet intelligent read (at times), this book is your book. The plot combines the elements of the Twilight saga with, say Kate Mosse's \\"Labyrinth.\\" All I can say is please do not take this too seriously. Most of all: enjoy!
B004N44SOI|5.0|I am always weary of a sophomore album, but this one did not disappoint! It has the same feel as the first, but fresh new music and lyrics.  Definite must buy if you like the first album!
B003H6KRIE|4.0|Came in record time. so far so good.<br />i got this for my dad for Father day because he says<br />\\"Damnit i wanna see what this movie is about and when its on tv they cut so much out i never know whats going on\\"
B0037KMHRY|1.0|Hi this review is not of the music which is great.<br /><br />The way they secure the CD in the case is by a hub. To get it out you need to place your fingre under the edge of the CD and lift until the CD bends and eventually you force the CD over the ring and it comes out, AFTER bending the CD significantly, which damages the CD and reduces its life expectancy. DONT BEND CDS!<br /><br />So download the music don't by the CD, or buy it and get your own jewel case to store the CD in.<br />You should be able to turn the CD case upside down and press the hub and the CD is released and falls onto your thumb then turn the CD right side up and take it out. Simple, well in a well designed CD jewel case it is.<br /><br />However good the case looks it must be functional people!
0062060554|4.0|for the sensitive reader who identifies with the lead character, Christine. That sea-sickness is contagious or it is for me. I think as do most here that the writer is talented and that this book is good. But, having just finished it this hour, and having spent yesterday living with it, I feel that the middle is too long and the ending far too short.<br /><br />In that sense I cannot agree that the 'architeture\\" sp? of the book is all that great. I mostly am upset that part 111 the ending, has so much drama but that there is no part IV where Christina's life will begin again. To me, this is much like those foreign films that end on an enigma left to our imagination rather than shown in all its new details. As a reader who rarely reads mysteries, this maybe my problem because I needed more resolution and more sense of how life will go now that the dramatic fireworks are finally shown. What next? I give this 4 stars for the writing and the pacing, ironically, but left out one star because of the same pacing, a problem if you are interested in the next phase and not just being told what it is. I wanted to live that part especially after living the long story which frankly is good until it is resolved without us as participants. Anyone else feel that it was truncated at just the place where we wanted to see the new situation?
B004H83IM8|5.0|this was a great bargain. all 3 austin powers in one package. totally awesome price. my grandson is still enjoying it. delivery was quick enough that it came in time for his birthday.  thanks amazon.com
B0035V35PI|5.0|Ninja Assassin takes some elements from classic history, adds a dash of over-the-top action and fight scenes, and hits 'frappe'... on the cast. There's tons of gore. Granted, a lot of the action is enhanced with CGI, but if you can get past it, you're in for a fun ride. The protagonist spends just enough time between garnering sympathy and dishing out death. And he's not some invulnerable hero - he gets the stuffing kicked, cut, and  whipped out of him.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray is awesome indeed. There are a few behind-the scenes bits, one of which includes some commentary by Stephen K. Hayes, a well-known and real-world American ninja. Also included is a featurette on the lead actor, Korean pop star Rain, showing some of the grueling training he underwent. After viewing, it is revealed that every stunt man in the film was in one way or another either a highly trained martial artist or parkour artist.<br /><br />All in all, it's a great popcorn flick to just turn off your brain and enjoy. And by the end, you'll want to see Rain doing another martial arts film, guaranteed.
B004I11VZA|5.0|This movie is excellent. I enjoyed the movie and the martial arts style so much that i am now taking Wing Chun here in LA!! =)
B000BO0LKY|4.0|Anyone rating under 4 stars are simply hating. She is the best and this comeback just simply reminded us why. Mariah is the Queen. TEOM features breathtaking vocals, beyond solid production, gorgeous videos, and three new Grammy's lol. I think this literally is the best work since Butterfly. Highlights are:<br /><br />Mine Again<br />Circles<br />Fly Like A Bird<br />I Wish You Knew<br />We Belong Together<br /><br />Of course, this entire album is beyond anything i have heard in recent years. It is the best album is the 2000's. Buy it. And ignore the ppl rating it 1 star just to bring the rating down.
B003H3IOLE|5.0|In all these years of reading, no one ever mentioned this book, no one suggested it and I had never seen it on a list until last month. What a delightful piece of work. I was enthralled for four days wishing and hoping it would not be done too soon.    Francie, a small girl from Brooklyn grows up poor and hungry in a poor family with a handsome Irish singing father and a practical beautiful mother. Her brother Neeley is two years younger and together they weathered the storms of poverty. The story is told with kindness and simplicity. I loved it. the triumph of the American family. I am delighted
B00000ITOY|5.0|This is a great idea for any child.  The bright colors make it easy for babies to focus on and it's great for developing coordination.  The set I got for a friend arrived and is very high quality.  We were very impressed and her son loves it!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I very rarely work out, but after reading the reviews, I purchased this DVD. I am SO glad I chose the 30 Day Shred! I am day 7 and I love it! It is very challenging, but it circuit training makes it go by much quicker. It can be pure torture while working out, but afterward, you feel like you truly accomplished something wonderful & can't wait to start again. I haven't lost any weight (yet-things don't happen overnight), but my clothes fit differently.    Depending on your fitness level, I would defintely considering doing 2-3 workouts without the weights & adding them when you feel the time is right. Even without the weights, it's a butt kicker. I added them on day 4 & it was TOUGH!    Good luck!
0002171856|5.0|Bought this book, and it was in good condition.  Contains lots of useful and vital information.  The book was cheap and it was very cheap to get it to Norway.  I´m very happy with the book and Amazon    Regards Geir
0061478784|4.0|I first heard of Howl's Moving Castle when I saw the trailer for the movie.  Of course, me being a child at heart, I went out and got the movie.  What a wonderful and beautiful adventure!  So when I found out it was based on a book, I had to read it.  I don't regret it at all.  The film has several plot differences from the book.  But the basic plot is still the same.  Howl's Moving Castle is about a girl, Sophie, who gets cursed by The Witch of the Waste.  The curse turns her into an old woman.  Refusing to let her family see her as old and ugly she runs away hoping to find her fortune and maybe even break the curse.  While traveling she sees Howl's moving castle.  Everyone knows that Howl eats the hearts of young beautiful girls.  But Sophie isn't worried because she is old woman now.  So she lets herself in the castle.  She ends up working as Howl's cleaning lady after making a deal with the fire demon, Calcifer, that powers the castle.  Calcifer wants Sophie to help him break the contract he made with Howl in return he will break the curse on Sophie.  However, Calcifer cannot discuss the terms of the contract so he has to drop Sophie hints, which she never catches.  Likewise, the Witch of the Waste made it impossible for Sophie to tell anyone that she is under a curse.  Howl doesn't seem to care for Sophie and her cleaning but he puts up with her, letting her live in the castle.  Howl and his apprentice, Michael, make simple spells and charms for people of several towns.  They are always in the moving castle but the door to the outside is like a portal allowing them access to several places.  Howl is being pursued by the King to find his brother as well as the Wizard Suliman who disappeared.  Howl doesn't want responsibility or commitment, therefore he tries his best to sully his name/reputation in town and with the king.  However, with the Witch of the Waste wanting him for her own, Howl is constantly on the run, dragging Sophie, Michael and Calcifer with him.<br /> I adored this book.  I loved the movie and was so happy to find the book a bit different.  It was so much fun to read!  It was like going on an adventure.  At the beginning of the story, Sophie is working as an apprentice in her family's hat shop.  She has no backbone and is overly shy and quiet, spending more time talking to the hats she makes then to people.  One day the Witch of the Waste comes into the store and curses her, making her into an old woman.  As the story progresses, Sophie's personality matures and changes, she becomes more aggressive.  Instead of feeling that her fate has been decided for her she goes out and makes it how she wants.<br /> Howl hates being tied down to one place.  His character was so interesting.  He is a natural coward, yet brave when he has to be.  He is also such a drama king!  He's like a spoiled kid obsessed with vanity.  It made for some very hilarious situations.  Throughout the book he is constantly nagging at Sophie and blaming her for everything bad that happens. Howl hates Sophie cleaning and messing up all his stuff-but he never kicks her out.  Underneath the surface he is kind and compassionate-very deep under the surface.  These two traits come out very rarely and only for an instant at a time.  He is always begging for attention.  It's quite funny.  One of the funniest scenes was when Howl got a cold. I reread it several times and laughed out loud each and every time.  Calcifer was awesome.  He is a fire demon who made a contract with Howl and because of that is stuck inside the castle until the contract is broken.  He is so funny.  I would love to have a friend like Calcifer, even if he is a bit scary looking.<br /> The whole book was beautifully written.  The world was interesting.  It takes place in Ingary, which is like another dimension, where magic exists.  The ending is suspenseful and sweet.  There is no cliffhanger.  It has a HEA ending but I would still love to see more of Sophie, Howl, and Calcifer.Hopefully they show up in the next books.  Without trying to give anything away I will say that there is a little bit of romance, very little.  It is sweet and very PG.  The other stuff, not so much.  I wish there was more romance BUT, it is still worth it!  I loved every minute of it!  I wish I could read it again.  Actually I'd recommend reading it twice so that once you discovered everything by the end you can go back and see the reasons behind certain things, and pick up on Calcifer's hints-which even I had some trouble picking up.  Overall, it was a VERY unique and imaginative book.  It was charming and engrossing.  I enjoyed every minute of it.opefully they show up in the next books.

B000002AVF|5.0|Mariah is Mariah on this album and its simply breathtaking. Her vocals alone will make u cry. Her angelic tone, the way she emoting (simply melts ur ears), the production,  and once again the vocals,  are being crazy. She may not sing like this anymore, but Mariah is still the best. This album is so pure. Thank u Mariah. I love u So much!!!!
B002A4UQLW|1.0|Being A big Pearl Jam fan I was really looking forward to this album, unfortunately this is just another Neal Young album with Pearl Jam as A backing band. Wanted to like the album, listened to it dozens of times but there is just not much there. Instead of this buy the Pearl Jam / Neal Young EP Merkinball which only contains two songs \\"i got id\\" and \\"long Road\\", much better than Mirror Ball.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Collins has a wonderful basis for a plot and for the terrific characters she creates.  However, the book could be reduced from three to one.  The \\"Games\\" go on and on and become redundant; although the tributes are very resourceful, their experiences leave even their world to the far-fetched.  Reminiscent of Lord of the Flies, Collins could have had a wonderful teaching book here if she just reduced the entire trilogy to one book and still could have achieved her goal.  I would not recommend the book to most people because it is just too far out of the box and the message gets lost.  As a former English teacher, I would have loved to teach the book if it were condensed.

Every single track is fantastic, and while they keep the classic Foo sound--each song sounds unique and new.  For those of you who like your Foo on the hard side, this is the one you've been waiting for--they dial it up to 11 for every track . . . awesome, sick, killer, amazing, love love love this album.

B004K4AUZW|2.0|It isn't as awful as some people claim it to be, but neither is it the epic masterpiece others claim it to be. This isn't \\"The Fame\\" Gaga. This album is nothing like its predecessors. It's heavier, darker... edgier. That being said, Lady Gaga tries a bit too hard to push the envelope. It isn't done effortlessly like those before her. Vocally, it's a pretty sound album (as in, she sings a lot more than just morphing her voice. The eponymous track, The Edge of Glory, and Hair are examples). Lyrically, it leaves something to be desired. A lot of the lyrics are repetitive. How one overuses their OWN NAME in songs is beyond me, but she managed to get it done. I didn't know about the .99 two-day sell from Amazon. But, to me that explains the inflated 1.11 million first week sales. Otherwise, only her hardcore fans will like this. I am a fan, but I'm not so blinded by an artist to know when music sounds bad, overproduced, and all-around cheesy. I also know that drawing inspiration is a thing artists do to pay homage to their idols. But pretty much copy and pasting is not cool. I challenge you to find one song on here that doesn't sound like something that's been done. Fashion of His Love sounds like I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me), yes, the Whitney Houston song, right down to the noisy chorus. I never thought I'd think \\"Whitney\\" while listening to a Lady Gaga song. smh<br /><br />The best tracks are Born This Way, Bloody Mary, The Queen (where she does her best Freddie Mercury impression ironically), and The Edge of Glory.<br />The worst tracks are Americano, Government Hooker, and Bad Kids.<br />Most annoying tracks are Highway Unicorn (Road to Love), Scheibe, and Judas.<br /><br />The only thing we can hope for is that she learns from this debacle and next time makes \\"... music for the ears, not for the eyes.\\"

B003O86FMW|5.0|I thought the first book was good! This series just gets better and better. The hunger games series makes the twilight series look like garbadge (and I love the twilight series)! Twilight watch out cause the hunger games are comin and they will plow you right over.
B000SGGUWS|4.0|I enjoy the tv show a lot, but the books are so much better! When I started reading them I thought they would be childish like the show, but they are actually much more adult.. and surprising!  If you like the show you will love the books, and once you read this one you will want to buy the next right away. I read the first 3 in about 2 weeks, and that's only because I had to balance it with my 5 week summer college class and full time job.<br />Emily is my favorite character in this book.  She is struggling with who she is, which makes her more realistic and interesting to me.  I found Hanna unlikable and pathetic in this book, even though I adore her on the show (conceitedness aside).  Aria - whoa maniac, chill out.  She is way too obsessed with Ezra, it's kinda freaky.  I felt sorry for Spencer.  Her parents are harsh and she tries so hard for so little.  Although the \\"mature\\" stuff like smoking, drinking, and designer clothes were added, these girls act way too young for their age sometimes.  And their seduction techniques made me laugh they were so ridiculous.<br />The events in the book are interesting, albeit unlikely, and it was a fun book to read.  Probably the best in the series if I remember correctly.
B0036MQ7CO|5.0|My husband and I are great Blues fans with a particular liking for John Lee Hooker. Our friend James brought the CD around at New Year and we just had to have it. Blues music is a bit hard to come by in the local music stores which tend focus on more commercial stuff. WE have quite a few John Lee CDs and this one rounds off the collection nicely. I particularly like track 6 with Bonnie Raitt and the Santana one  Recommend highly to any Blues fan

One scene in particular sticks with me, when two cool, angsty, teenage girls look out the window to see two laughing, joyful younger sisters playing hopscotch.   A very good book, and time is a goon.

B0015DROBO|1.0|This is not a review of the book or Amazon (well kinda Amazon). This is a review of Random House Publishing and their shameful pricing for the Kindle version of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo and the other Millennium books. Back when Amazon had control of the pricing, the Kindle version of this book was around $5.50. Then Amazon gave control back to the publishers if they wanted it, Random House is this case. So what does Random House do? They immediately raise the price, to around $7.99. Now (June 17, 2011), in the wake of a very popular trailer for the upcoming U.S film, Random House has priced the Kindle version up to $9.99. That is $2 more than the mass market paperback and $1 more than the perfect paperback. Are they insane? Who would pay more for a digital copy with limited rights and no resale ability? I like to choose Kindle version for their convince and environmental friendliness, but I am not going to sit here and be punished for choice. No Kindle version should ever be priced higher than a paper copy. Hopefully the public agrees with me and send a message to Random House and other publishers by refusing to purchase such titles.
0446560073|1.0|Instead of more hilarious delightful catly antics from Simon's cat, after the first 20 pages or so you get page after page of repetitive too-busy unrealistic scribbling. I pre-ordered this book and waited for it with great anticipation. I'm sorry I wasted my money.
B003JTHESA|5.0|I think most reviewers have already said it... but this is a great album by one of the best metal bands of all time. You really need to listen to it completely at least several times... and it will grow on you.<br /><br />I actually was very impressed on my first play through. The music is (mostly) amazing, and Bruce sounds just about as good as ever. He definitely sounds better than about 90% of every other metal front man out there today. His voice has aged amazingly, in my opinion. The more I listen to the album, the stronger it gets.<br /><br />I give the album 5 stars... even though to me, it's not perfect. The last song, which for me should always be the strongest (end with a big bang... making the listener want to hear the whole album again), is the weakest (just my opinion). After hearing it about a dozen times now, I just can't get into it. I get it... and I actually appreciate it... but for me, it just doesn't fit with the album. That's a minor gripe though, in what is an amazing effort by one of the best metal bands ever!
0307474275|5.0|Dan Brown<br /><br />The Da Vinci Code<br /><br />Corgi Books, Paperback, 2004.<br />12mo. 605 pp.<br /><br />First published in 2003.<br /><br />==========================================<br /><br />It seems that I really should be ashamed of myself for having enjoyed this book a great deal; even more for rating it with the maximum five stars. Strangely enough, I am not. There are simple reasons for that: I picked up the book with as an unprejudiced mind as it is possible for human being to have and I didn't expect more than it could give me. So I found it gripping, compelling and fascinating read; a real page turner from cover to cover - and I had already watched the movie and knew pretty well everything that would happen; still the book hold my attention consistently, and that's saying a great deal. Certainly it isn't a book that is designed to make you think and enrich your personality. Far from it. It is book to be read solely for pleasure and entertainment. Is there anything so bad in that?<br /><br />Before proceeding with this review there are two extremely important things about The Da Vinci Code that must be mentioned and stressed firmly since many people don't seem to remember them. This book is: 1) fiction; 2) a thriller. Now, let's look at some of the most debatable points about it; I fully realise that I myself must be a damned fool to bother with others' stupidity but then again, nobody's perfect.<br /><br />Historical inaccuracy.<br />Did you expect historical accuracy in a work of fiction? If you did, you hardly know the meaning of the word 'fiction' or you are too lazy to read historical studies in order to gain some knowledge and you hope to get it in the easy way, through a novel. Obviously Dan Brown cannot hold a candle to Gore Vidal, for instance, but then again The Da Vinci Code is not a historical novel; not that it would have mattered if it was. A novelist is at full liberty to manipulate his facts, historical or not, in every possible way he chooses. His aim is to write a story, not history. His story must be coherent, plausible and convincing; and Dan Brown did an excellent job. Of course there are some improbabilities but no more than what should be expected in a thriller. Now some of you may cry out: 'Ah, but Dan Brown said in so-and-so interview that everything in the book is true!'. He may well have. It only shows that Dan Brown is not a very intelligent man and as we all know, one can be an excellent novelist without being very intelligent. If the most readers of The Da Vinci Code had been so, they might have enjoyed a nice little game called 'read more history, learn something new and historically accurate about the fictional events described in the novel'; but it was not to be. For my part, beside a great deal of entertainment, the book did tickle my interest into reading more history about the Holy Grail, sacred feminine, the Knights Templar and so on. That's far more than it should be expected from a thriller and it is an excellent bonus indeed. But it is much harder, and requires much more mental power and application, than just to spill venom on how historically inaccurate the novel, a work of fiction, really is; obviously this is how most people fulfill their characters. Well, there is no harm in it. Actually, it is a rather amusing spectacle to watch.<br /><br />The story wasn't new.<br />So what? Dr Johnson said more than two centuries ago that if a story is new it is unlikely to be good and if it is good it is unlikely to be new. The story of The Da Vinci Code is very good indeed. Moreover, it is told in skillful way that shows a good deal of excellent sense for dramatic incident. By the way, the story was new for me and I find it compelling. But that doesn't at all mean that I am going to accept everything in it as a gospel truth, nor do I have time, or desire for that matter, to waste my time and energy with scathing attacks on the historical inaccuracy of a novel, a work of - I repeat! - fiction.<br /><br />The characters are dull.<br />Of course they are - they must be. For this a thriller, remember? And thriller is made with action, not with profoundly drawn characters of immense psychological depth. If you are looking for such thing in, I repeat, a thriller, you are looking in the wrong place. If you could find it, the book would not be a thriller. By the way, at least the main characters are not at all so badly drawn. Both in Robert and Sophie there is something; not much for sure but something nonetheless. Furthermore, the flirt between them is limited to five lines out of five hundred pages and that's something highly commendable indeed.<br /><br />Dan Brown writes badly.<br />Well, if anything The Da Vinci Code is eminently readable. I call something 'badly written' if it is totally unreadable or utterly tedious; I found Dan Brown's style neither. His sentences can be somewhat clumsy sometimes but nothing terrible at all. Moreover, their meaning is seldom unclear. I surmise most of these accusations how badly Dan Brown writes are made by people who try to write themselves and are green with envy that somebody who doesn't at all write better (actually much worse, if you ask them) should attain such a popularity and make pots of money while their considerable merit still remains unrecognised by the world. It is very natural. I guess another reason for this may be the deep preconception in the minds of many people, who probably don't even realise how conceited they are, that something readable can have any value, that something popular must be valueless. It must be a great comfort for such people that what they read is not read by the common run of men because it is so much above their intelligence. It is flattering for the human vanity, is it not?<br /><br />The book offends a good many devout Christians and Christianity as a whole and so on and so forth.<br />Well, frankly speaking, all people who are offended as Christians and think their religion, nay their faith even, compromised by a work of fiction are - no apologies! - perfect morons. No excuses can be found and no allowances can be made for people who so obviously and so completely lack common sense. There is no obligation to read, much less to like, any work of - I repeat yet again - fiction; and if you don't have the slight amount of imagination, should you like it, to enjoy it, you'd better not read it at all. The tremendous religious hysteria that The Da Vinci Code has caused is just another perfect example for the uncommon stupidity of the human race as a whole.<br /><br />Is The Da Vinci Code a great book? I don't know - and neither do you. Only time can, and will, tell this. I can certainly say it is an excellent thriller and since I think a book should be judged, if at all, only within its genre I have no hesitation to give it full five stars. Surely it is isn't a book designed to make you think or to develop your personality; it is such by design; so any accusations that it actually doesn't are simply pathetic. It is book to be read solely for entertainment and enjoyment. It is a thriller and the first and foremost you should ask from a thriller is to give you a thrill. If it does that, it does quite enough. I don't expect I will ever re-read The Da Vinci Code but I certainly don't consider the time spent reading it as lost. It's been quite a thrill.e.

055358894X|4.0|The book tends to bounce between the main character as a child and as an adult so be aware that you will be reading basically two separate story lines.  While the story is very well done there is a few mysteries that the author hints at but don't seem to be related to the story.  Random comments about an ancient civilization are introduced but don't seem to go anywhere.  While this book is the beginning of the series it just didn't make sense for the author to make commentary about the architecture unless he was intending to have the main character discover something unique about it.  Outside of these mild annoyances I am really enjoying the series.  I am looking forward to more from this author.
159514188X|5.0|I could have been Hannah.  If my parents hadn't loved and supported me without fail, I could have been her.  Many things in her story are in my own.  Hannah Baker took her own life. I haven't been so deeply affected by a book in a long time, perhaps never.  And though it was sad, devastating, and exhausting, it was also beautiful. And as unlikely as it seems, I found myself a little more at peace when it ended.  It seems impossible that a book about the suicide of a teen girl could end with hope, yet, it does.<br /><br />The writing is brilliant.  I was pulled in from the very first pages and unable to stop listening to Hannah - just as Clay was unable to.  Having the story alternate between his reactions and her reasons was the perfect balance. It was as though the author anticipated our reactions to Hannah, and Clay played them out for us.  The author says he talked with women about their experiences in high school.  Even more amazingly, he actually listened. Hannah's voice rings true.  More importantly, the author (Hannah) does not excuse her own responsibility in her death.  That would be the easy way out.<br /><br />This may be the most personal, deeply felt review I have ever written. Will ever write.  But this book deserves absolute honesty. To hell with \\"The Lord of the Flies\\" and \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" - schools need to add this to their required reading list.  And discuss it.  It's not perfect, but no book is.  There will be people like Marcus, who dismiss their own actions.  But maybe, just maybe, after reading this they will reconsider casual cruelty.  There is nothing casusal about it.  \\"A book that you can't get out of your mind.\\" Ellen Hopkins could not be more right.  Read this.
B000GRUS22|5.0|So first off, I need to rant a little bit. I'm going back through Enigma's vast music catalogue and listening to the journey start to finish. As I'm doing so, I'm reading through the reviews of all the albums, and I'm left befuddled, pissed off, and just generally annoyed by the naysayers. Now, everyone has an absolute right to critique music, in fact, I firmly believe it should be done, but it seems no matter what Cretu does, and how brilliantly Enigma progresses its sound, some people just can't be pleased. In all the negative reviews, there are people bitching that Enigma's sound is being recycled over and over again, then in the same breath bitching that the sound is too different from the other albums. Seriously? Do you honestly think Michael Cretu would be continuing to produce Enigma records and SELLING Enigma records if there was no evolution in the sound? If you want MCMXC, a.D. over and over and over again, just go out and buy every record by every copycat new age project that rode and and continues to ride Enigma's coattails. Personally, I think while MCMXC,a.D. was sheer brilliance and utterly original when it was first released, now 20 years later, it's starting to sound dated and tired. It's the same way I feel about Delerium's \\"Karma\\". Cretu has said several times in interviews that one of the great things about doing Enigma is how he is able to explore so many different musical landscapes and not be tied to a single framework of sound. Why in the world would he want to stay stuck in one musical place over the span of twenty years? I have to assume he'd probably be bored out of his skull.     Cretu is and always will be a musical pioneer. Not everything he does is perfect, but it doesn't have to be. He set the standard for an entirely new genre of music, and so many electronic artists out there owe their success to him.     Now, on to \\"A Posteriori\\". This record is brilliant in so many ways. On this sixth Enigma offering, Cretu has found the perfect landscape, or skyscape rather, to showcase his new, cutting edge, compact studio he has dubbed \\"The Alchemist\\", and he does it brilliantly. The sound here is a complete departure from any other previous album under the Enigma moniker. The flutes, gregorian chants, world elements are all gone, and instead we are presented with a dark, slick, beautiful, purely electronic (with the exception of Cretu's beautiful classical guitar riff at the beginning of \\"Invisible Love\\") ambient and mostly instrumental set of songs that just beg to be listened to while stargazing. The beats here pulse and undulate instead of attack. The result is stunning. Cretu does lend his, erm...unique...vocals here, however, they are far more subtle and muted than on \\"Le Roi Est Mort...Vive Le Roi!\\" or \\"The Screen Behind the Mirror\\", and they seem to lend themselves to the music rather than detract from it.     Some highlights on this disc include the arrestingly beautiful opener \\"Eppur si Muove\\", which contains the closest thing to gregorian chants on this album. \\"Eppur\\" features a robotic latin chant that isn't quite Gregorian, but still dances around that territory.     \\"Dancing With Mephisto\\" is extremely dark, very very slick, sexual, pulsating, and almost creepy at times. One of my favorite tracks.    \\"Invisible Love\\" can only be described as throbbing. As I mentioned above, it opens with Cretu playing his classical guitar, which is a great contrast to the sheer electronica of the rest of the song, and the rest of the disc. His singing is featured in this song, but it really does work with the feel.     \\"Sitting on the Moon\\" is one of my favorites on this disc. It utilizes the same mid-tempo drum loops as \\"In the Shadow, In the Light\\" from Enigma's previous disc, \\"Voyageur\\". The song is sad, plaintive and beautiful. The loneliness that is conveyed in this song is tangible, and Cretu makes us believe it.     The closing track, and first single from this record, \\"Goodbye Milky Way\\", is the closest nod to the old Enigma sound that we get on this album. It does feature an ethnic, yet almost robotic chant that punctuates the song, but at the same time, it keeps with the same flavor as the rest of the songs. Many thought this was Michael Cretu's swan song to Enigma fans because of the lyrics from the chorus: \\"Mission is over/Mission is done/I'll miss you, children of the sun/Now it's time to go away/Goodbye, goodbye Milky Way.\\" Thank God he was only referring to the ending of the \\"A Posteriori\\" journey.     All in all, this album is so special, and such a wonderful departure for Cretu and Enigma. The fact that it is different is what makes it so compulsively listenable. Well done, Cretu!

Those are the books that transport you into another time and another world, or another times and anotherworlds to be more exact; they provoke you, shock you, charm you, seduce you; they destroy tons of ideas you thought imperishable, but they also create myriad of new notions to replace them. After the last page the entropy in your head is close to the maximum, for there numerous facts, feelings, theories, hypotheses and what not relentlessly occupy your brain until you are almost driven crazy. Then it calms - until the next reading, which causes the same mental hurricane until descriptions such as ''literary classic'' or ''science fiction'' start looking unbearably shallow and stupid. For me, Arthur Clarke's ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' is precisely that kind of book. Which is why I surmise its review would prove a trifle too much. Well, let's see.    But please remember: this is only a work of fiction.  The truth, as always, will be far stranger.  [Foreword.]    If you are brave enough to open this book, you will immediately be thrown three million years back, until the times when some of the earliest predecessors of Homo sapiens trod on the African savannas. There Moon-Watcher, as the smartest and the most accomplished among his fellows, is chosen to be the beginning of the future mankind, no less. The evolution of the human race is the goal of a grand experiment, and obviously a successful one since the vast scope of human civilisation passes in the blink of an eye: from the momentous discovery of the hunting and the fire, through the typical for man endless wars, all the way to the development of the nuclear weapons. Finally, a 2000-year-old dream comes true and man reaches the Moon, not only that but he actually colonises it. Dr Heywood Floyd is a scientist who is accustomed to working with periods of time that are lost in the mist of the past, but on the surface of the Moon, or a little below to be exact, he is confronted with a mystery that has a lot more to offer than immense time scales - extraterrestrial intelligence.    You want a break? There's no time forthat! Instead, you are sent in the open space, on the board of the spaceship Discovery and in the company of the astronauts David Bowman and Frank Poole - and of course the board computer HAL 9000, a last-generation highly intelligent machine that can navigate the whole ship independently and make conversation with a voice very much like human's. The mission of Discovery, at least the official one, is to reach the mystically beautiful Saturn, perform scientific measurements for 100 days and then become a dwarf planet; no matter that Saturn already has no fewer than fifteen of these, one of them as big as Mercury. But things turned out somewhat differently. Going through one almost personal tragedy, a merciless fight with an inhuman opponent, the receiving of some totally incredible - literally - news from Earth and, finally, one creation of unimaginably advanced mind, the space odyssey of Dave Bowman will take him beyond the boundaries of the wildest imagination and most abandoned fantasy, where the spirit is relieved from the chains of the flesh. In case you wonder what Moon-Watcher, Heywood Floyd and Dave Bowman have in common, I'll only tell you that this is one mysterious monolith, black and absorbing light to the point when it looks almost immaterial, with ideally smooth surface and perfect proportions 1:4:9, which had been left by a civilisation advanced enough to explore the space in times when our predecessors thought that to reach the Moon one simply has to climb a higher tree.    Arthur Clarke is the man with a genius for writing and all-embracing erudition who mixes scientific facts, daring hypotheses, vivid characters and dramatic events in a cocktail that once read is never forgotten. His brilliant writing style combines in a most subtle manner lots of popular science, including enough astronomical figures to a make one dizzy, with suspenseful action that may often take your breath away. On the top of all that, philosophical digressions that invite youto look deeply into some of the darkest corners of your soul are not missing either. As a special bonus, there is of course Arthur Clarke's delicious sense of humour. His sarcasm as regards the mental capacity of our ape-like ancestors or his sharp irony about the life at zero gravity - from the buoyant walking to the eating in sticky sauces and the peculiar use of the toilet - are hilarious and unforgettable. One can laugh one's head off a good many times and one can learn a great deal of interesting tidbits from the world of astronomy, but what really makes 2001: A Space Odyssey a truly great book and an outstandingly powerful experience is the fact that in mere 300 pages - duodecimo format - you can immerse yourself in three completely different worlds: man, the technology invented by him and an extraterrestrial intelligence way too sophisticated for us even to start to comprehend its wonders.    ''Would you like to go to Earth?''  Her eyes widened with astonishment; then she shook her head.  ''It's a nasty place; you hurt yourself when you fall down. Besides there are too many people.''  [Chapter 10.]    Man. For three million years he has conquered and nearly completely devastated the Earth; but mere half a century after his first foray into space, he has already founded colonies on the Moon where the first generations ''Spaceborn'' come into existence. Since the Moon's gravity is six times weaker than the Earth's, the moon people grow twice faster but age twice slower than their earthly fellows; curiously, their attitude towards their former planet is most frankly expressed by a four year old girl (who looks as though she's eight). The Moon episode in the book is an excellent opportunity for a little nostalgic glance back to the Cold War, and we can also remember what is the difference between mass and weight, but that's just about all of its significance. Man already looks much further in space, towards Saturn and Jupiter, and with the stupid arrogance typical for him thinks that, if he knows something about hibernation and plasma drive, the space will immediately reveal all of its ancient secrets. There's only one thing that the Master of the Earth has not foreseen: the danger that comes, not from the outside, but from the inside - from his own creations.    ''Poole and Bowman had often humorously referred to themselves as caretakers or janitors aboard a ship that could really run itself. They would have been astonished, and more than a little indignant, to discover how much truth that jest contained.''  [Chapter 16.]    Technology. Without doubt the favourite baby of mankind, with ever-increasing abilities, especially in the field of computers, technology constantly surprises even the most optimistic. Generation after generation, the intelligent machines become faster and cleverer, more powerful and more versatile, with stunning achievements which fascinate people rather than scare them - perhaps it should be the other way around. For some very difficult and very dangerous questions are bound to arise, and no one can give certain answers to them. Can a computer think? Can he be enthusiastic? Or make a mistake? How does one fabulously intelligent machine perceive human values, feelings, nightmares - honour, responsibility, pain, death? Nobody knows. We can at best speculate about these matters, yet is it not a little too naive to leave a human life entirely in his power? In the midst of the vast interplanetary desolation, a single space ship is too small for two brains, one of them electronic. (Can he be vicious?) The collision between man and machine is inescapable. It is bound to be epic and grand and merciless. The time and the place cannot be predicted, but we would do well to be prepared - otherwise the Earth may well communicate with the next aliens on behalf of somebody else.    ''And this at once raised another problem: could any technique, no matter how advanced, bridge the awful gulf that lay between the Solar System and the nearest alien sun?''  [Chapter 32.]    Extraterrestrial intelligence. Every man with IQ above 30 has asked himself ''Are we alone in the universe?'', and though many may reply boldly ''Of course not!'', very few of them probably really think so. Because small talk to kill time and boredom is one thing, but to find a solid evidence that proves the existence of alien civilisation light years ahead of us in terms of technology - that is quite another story. Under such circumstances it becomes most obvious how pathetic the nature of Homo sapiens really is. (''Wise man''? Is this a joke?) The eternal and enormous human vanity - the essence of our minds - has such astronomical proportions that it knows no boundaries even in the open space. All right, aliens do exist. In this case, they must be human-like and therefore slaves of the flesh; if anybody thinks differently, he is promptly ostracized and put in the despised guild of the spiritualists. Our skull's internal volume is supposed to have increased significantly since the times of our ape-like ancestors, but in the half-empty space there prejudices and preconceptions still reign supreme; an epic narrow-mindedness that would have been amusing, had it not been pathetic instead.    We are strange creatures, the humans: we always care much more for our bodies than for our spirit. No, this is not some lousy sermon for the salvation of your miserable soul. Far from it. But, seriously, how often does any of us manage to break the bondage of the flesh and feel the real power of the human spirit? Very seldom - if ever. I even doubt if there are such people in the history of mankind at all, people who really have succeeded to detach completely their spirits from their bodies and achieve at least an illusion of freedom. The famous conditions of nirvana or the contemplation of God by the mystics sounds rather trivial in this case, almost silly; about methods such as sex, drugs and rock'n'roll I needn't talk at all. The artistic creation is perhaps the only human activity that can make some feeble claims to have ever achieved an absolute freedom of spirit, if only for a short while. But do you really want to know what that is, what such a fabulous liberation from the slavery of flesh, so that time, space and matter are of no consequence anymore, really is? Ask Dave Bowman. He knows.    ''But the barriers of distance are crumbling; one day we shall meet our equals, or our masters, among the stars.''  [Foreword.]    ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' was first published in 1968, by way of being a result of Arthur Clarke's collaboration with Stanley Kubrick on the screenplay of the movie with the same name; the movie is so stupendous a failure in every aspect except the visual one for its time, that it really doesn't deserve a single sentence of its own. Later the great British sci-fi writer published three odysseys more: 2010: Odyssey Two (1982), 2061: Odyssey Three (1988) and 3001 The Final Odyssey (1997); even the worst of these - the last one - is thoroughly readable and highly enjoyable, but even the best one among them - the second - lacks the epic grandeur and philosophical depth of the original odyssey. But one should always bear in mind that ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' gives a lot - from the global psychology of mankind, through the chilling depths of the electronic brain, finally to the ultimate release of the human spirit from the severe limitations of the flesh. But this is a book that asks a lot too. It asks from the reader his full intellectual potential and the most daring flights of imagination he is capable of. Only thus can you get all it has to offer. May everybody have one day the opportunity to babble incoherently as Dave Bowman did:    ''The thing's hollow - it goes on forever and - oh my God! - it's full of stars!''  [Chapter 39.]    P.S. By the way, ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' may also serve as an excellent mental self-test. If you read this book carefully and it doesn't cause at least for a short time an explosion of your grey matter, that simply means that you are an idiot!    ==========================================    Note on the edition.    This more or less anniversary edition - on the verge of the new millennium and year 2001 - contains a most fascinating preface by Arthur Clarke concerning his work together with Stanley Kubrick on the screenplay of the eponymous movie which eventually led to the writing of the novel as well. Included is a long quote from the book especially dedicated to this bizarre working relationship: The Lost Worlds of 2001(1972), again by Arthur Clarke, charmingly described in this foreword as ''(mostly) nonfictional account of our enterprise''. Indeed, the title page of the book bears a telling indication of that: ''Based on a Screenplay by Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke.'' But that's another story for another review.
0061998494|5.0|I read Ferguson's novel, Between the Bridge and the River, a few years ago and loved it.  I wasn't even a big fan of his; but I found the book by chance, the story sounded intriguing and funny, and it far exceeded my expectations.    This book isn't quite as consistently mesmerizing, but it's a very good read.  I think Ferguson is funny, but as a writer, he's often sublime.  His story, from nerdy kid to fall-down drunk to angry child-man to eventual success and American citizen will make you laugh and empathize with a man who has paid his fair share of dues on the way to stardom.  I was also amazed at how comfortable Ferguson seems to be with himself.  Considering his struggles with alcoholism, this is a true testament to the power of recovery and the resilience of the human spirit.    If you are not a Ferguson fan, don't worry.  His writing is exceptional by any standard, not just because he's a TV celebrity who can actually write with humility, perspective and loads of humor.  And no ghost writer!    This is a story that can provide inspiration (and laughs) for anyone who has fallen on their face and not only lived to tell about it, but also wants to live a richer, fuller life as a result.    Hope he continues to write!
B001UHOWXI|5.0|A classic and very touching movie. Amazing performance by James Stewart and great direction by Frank Capra.    The video quality is fantastic, and this edition contains both black & white and colorized versions. Also, this edition, comes with a great slipcover.    The only problem is that don't have much special features, only the original theatrical trailer (in HD) and the making of. (22 minutes)    Very recommended!
B000SXOFL4|5.0|This album is wonderful, but if for no other reason for the lead single \\"Gravity of Love\\". Everything about this song is glorious. It is big, powerful, haunting, dark, but yet full of hope. The beat is relentless (it is a big modification of the beat used in \\"Return to Innocence\\"), crisp, crunchy and almost forces you to close your eyes and let it envelop you.     This song is wildly atmospheric. Cretu has chosen to sample Carl Orff's \\"Carmina Burana\\" throughout the album, but the famous opening lines from \\"O Fortuna\\" are prominently featured here. This sample adds to the very large darkness in this song, and complements it beautifully.     Ruth-Ann Boyle, the vocalist behind the electronic duo Olive, lends her voice for the lead vocal in this song. The lyrics are fantastic, and Ruth-Ann's powerful voice fits this song so well.     Believe me this album is worth purchasing for \\"Gravity of Love\\" alone. The rest of the tracks (for the most part) are stellar, but nothing stands out quite like GoL.
B000OIBY4Y|5.0|When I started reading the book, I had some buyer remorse because it's slow going early on.  It's also written in an entirely different manner than I'm used to, so it took a bit.  That said, I really enjoyed the main character, Mersault.  Certainly a unique main character.<br /><br />Like others have stated, the first part of the book is slow compared to Part 2.  However, the first part lays a lot of foundation for the second, so there is a point.<br /><br />This book is worth the purchase for a few reasons.  For one, there's not much else like it in literature.  If there is, I haven't read anything comparable.  Second, it's a book that can and should be read more than once.  That way, you get more of the context and underlying themes.  Third, it's short enough that another read shouldn't take long at all.<br /><br />My only critique is the length of this book.  Just when it gets interesting and I'm drawn all the way in, it's over.  Small critique anyways, and that might be one of the finer points.
0345529057|3.0|Although Game of Thrones series by Martin is engaging I definately would not classify it as intellectually stimulating as the \\"Malazans - Book of the Fallen\\" series by Steven Erikson.  Tolkien stories, whether you like it or not, are simplistic tales of good versus evil - so yes, Martin's novels are a step up from Tolkien but to a truly educated fantasy novel reader Erikson absolutely blows Martin away.  So in considering the feedback from some of those 'offical reviews' on Martin consider that the author of that feedback probably had the IQ of 100.  For those with an IQ in the range of 130-150 Tolkien and even Martin are really just a bit boring!
B00006CXSS|5.0|This miniseries is amazing. The acting, script, and directing are all top-notch! Once you start the first episode, you'll be hooked. Just set aside about 10 hours and plow through the whole thing. You'll be glad that you did.
B001VSD0F2|4.0|So...while I adore many aspects of this record, it took quite awhile for me to warm up to. Let me get the not-so-good stuff out of the way first, then talk about the highlights.     The biggest complaint I have about this album is first and foremost, the majority of drum loops Cretu used throughout this record. Imagine my dismay and disappointment in Cretu when I discovered that more than one of the drum loops, and spoken word vocal samples are included in Apple's Remix Tools Jam Pack (which incidentally was released before \\"Seven Lives, Many Faces\\") for Garage Band. Really, Michael? Not that this is the first time Cretu has used other peoples' drum loops: On \\"Return to Innocence\\" he borrowed the drum loop from Led Zeppelin's \\"When The Levee Breaks\\", and consequently this loop has been used a hundred million times by other electronic artists; he also borrowed the drum loop from Madonna's \\"Justify My Love\\" for the Orthodox version of \\"Mea Culpa\\" from the first Enigma album. But seriously? A GARAGE BAND drum loop? Come on.     Another issue I have with this album is the amount of \\"filler\\" songs, such as \\"Hell's Heaven\\" and \\"Fata Morgana\\". I tend to skip over these tracks.     Now, on to the good stuff. I can't say enough good things about the opening track, \\"Encounters\\". This track serves as the intro track that has been present on every Enigma album to date. \\"Encounters\\" begins almost inaudibly, but as we listen, the spooky, creepy female spoken voice gets louder, and speaks of all the mystical things that surround the number 7: Seven stars, seven days, seven seals, seven gates. Seven angels, seven skies, seven sins, seven lives.\\" To this day, I'm pretty sure that this voice is not of human origin at all, but rather completely created electronically. The effect is downright eerie, but I can sit and listen to this track on repeat and get chills every time.     The first time I heard the song \\"Seven Lives\\", I kind of wanted to throw up. Andru Donalds, the vocalist on this song, has peppered Enigma's music since \\"The Screen Behind the Mirror\\". Sometimes, his voice is great, but other times (more often) it's simply annoying. He tends to \\"growl\\" all the songs he sings for Enigma, but he isn't always as harsh (check out his lovely solo track - produced by Cretu- called \\"Snowing Under My Skin\\" for a perfect example of how beautiful his voice can be). \\"Seven Lives\\" does feature Andru's growling vocal, but after the first few painful listens to this song, it REALLY started to grow on me, and now has become one of my absolute favorites from this record. The song is driving, very rhythmic, and the *LIVE* strings just make this song epic and very theatrical.    \\"Touchness\\" is just dirty, but it re-incorporates Enigma's signature sexuality that oozed out of \\"MCMXC a.D.\\". I like this song, but it DOES contain one of the Garage Band drum loops, which makes it fall quite short of what it could be.    \\"The Same Parents\\" is one of the standouts. On first listen, this song made me cringe a little- the lyrics come off a little Cheez Whiz, but there are some really great elements. The beat in this song is FANTASTIC (and as far as I know, not a Garage Band loop), and features vocals by Cretu's twins, Sebastian and Nikita, which is such a neat tribute, and very appropriate for the song. Their voices are very much like Cretu's, which ultimately could be a bad thing, but it seems to work for this song.     \\"La Puerta del Cielo\\" is probably the most standout track here, and very much bears the signature Enigma sound. The vocalist on this song is one Cretu has never used before, and I think all of us Enigma fans can agree that we hope he utilizes her incredible voice far more in the future. \\"Cielo\\" has a very familiar swinging beat that hearkens back to \\"Sadeness\\". The bassline though sounds slightly cheesy and dated.     \\"The Language of Sound\\" is an amalgamation of many different chants, a lot of which are sampled from several past Enigma albums. The effect is wonderful. This track is joyous, and is a reminder that while Enigma is changing, Cretu has not forgotten his past.     So, overall, a fairly decent record, but seems slightly lazy in spots. I wouldn't recommend this disc for someone who is just discovering Enigma, instead I'd suggest picking up \\"The Platinum Collection\\" and \\"Le Roi Est Mort...Vive le Roi!\\" for a better sampling of the greatnes that is Enigma. I think overall, longtime fans and listeners will appreciate this latest effort from Michael Cretu and Enigma.
B0000BYM3K|4.0|Hello everyone. If you like Iron Maiden, you'll like this. A little cheesy and corny at first listen, but then so is most metal. A group of fifty somethings rockin' all over today's youth.    Up the Irons!
B004G600A4|5.0|we love this movie!  we received it very quickly and it was in perfect shape, still wrapped in plastic.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|George R. R. Martin's A Clash of King is the second book in the Song of Ice and Fire series.  I gave Game of Thrones a 5-star rating. Five stars is a hard rating to come by and a hard rating to match and while I didn't give A Clash of Kings 5-stars (I give it 4), it is only because some of the novelty of the style in which Martin tells his story is no longer new.<br /><br />Outside of that, A Clash of Kings was a rather breathtaking book that carries the story forward from where A Game of Thrones left off and mixes in some new viewpoint characters along the way. I counted 9 viewpoint characters throughout the novel (10 if you can't the Maester in the prologue, who we never return to). Some of these characters we are familiar with and some of the them are new. Some of the new viewpoints are familiar characters, like Theon Grayjoy, but this is the first time we see things unfolding from his eyes. Others are new to the story, like Davos.<br /><br />There are three things that I think Martin does masterfully in A Clash of Kings (and remember, I am a recent convert to epic fantasy, thanks to A Game of Thrones):<br /><br />1. He carries the epic forward in such a way that our interest is ever increasing, but without ever revealing too much at once.<br /><br />2. He build on the characters so that we become as familiar with them as our own friends and family.<br /><br />3. He build the world in such a way as that we become as familiar with it as our own surroundings.<br /><br />One of the things that impressed me about A Game of Thrones was that the \\"magic\\" in the story was only hinted at. People knew that magic used to exist, but much of it had disappeared. There wasn't a good explanation for this, but that's because no one really seemed to know why. It wasn't until the very end of the novel that we started to see some hints of magic that still lingered in the world. In A Clash of Kings, we see more magic than we saw in the first book (indeed, we see some at work in the Prologue). Throughout the novel, we see more and more, just enough of it to keep us interested, but only marginally more overt than the first book. And yet, as the magic takes place, we also learn why it is growing stronger and that reasoning, so far as I can tell, falls completely in line with the story as laid out so far.<br /><br />But the book is about much more than magic. It's about the struggle of 5 men to become king of the realm. What I found rather remarkable about the events in A Clash of Kings is that when you get to the end of the book and see everything that has happened, it all makes perfect sense, and it all flows from what happened at the beginning of A Game of Thrones. As someone was saying on a podcast I was on the other night, you want to scream at Eddard Stark when he agrees to leave Winterfell to become the Hand of the King: \\"No! Stay behind! Don't go!\\" The world is a very different place than it was when things started out.<br /><br />Another remarkable aspect of A Clash of Kings-for me at least-is that the characters are by now so well developed that as a reader, I felt like I knew them and could guess their reactions to various events. When one of the key players in the struggle to become king was killed, my first thought was: oh man, what is Tyrion Lannister going to think about that? When Davos led the fleet into the river before King's Landing, wondering if there was some sort of trap, I wanted to scream at him. As these events unfolded, I found myself wondering what the various players would think of them, in much the same way I do when some juicy piece of gossip reaches you at work. (\\"Wow, I wonder what so-and-so will say when they find out that project has been killed.\\") It takes some measure of skill to build characters so rich and deep and distinct from one another. I wish I could do this as well in my own writing.<br /><br />In addition to the characters, the surrounding world has become more familiar in all of its aspects. Often times, in epic books like these (those that I have read), I easily get lost in trying to deal with all of the places and people and their spacial relations to one another. But Martin is so subtle about how he introduces places anad characters, so vivid in his description horrendous of them, that it all seems clear in my head and when we follow characters to places, be they sites of battle or big cities, I never feel lost. And there must be hundreds of minor characters, but the more prominent of them are as clear in my mind as the major players.<br /><br />Perhaps my favorite scene in this book was the battle scene on the river in front of King's Landing, especially when Tyrion Lannister leads a troop into battle. That scene reminded me very much of the opening scene of Saving Private Ryan. It was remarkable and during the time that I read that scene, the entire world around me fell away and I was very much there in the middle of that attack. I will be very interested to see how HBO managed to pull off that scene in Season 2 of A Game of Thrones.<br /><br />I also loved that we got to go beyond the Wall in this book.<br /><br />I'd say that there might have been some slow parts early on (the book is 1,000 pages long), but \\"slow\\" is a relative term and the change in pacing that I experienced might have been due to the fact that I couldn't read the book every day. I was just too busy. But a number of people have told me that the first two books are really just a build-up to the third book, A Storm of Swords.  Already I can't wait to get more into that one.<br /><br />In the end, A Clash of Kings carried the story forward in a masterful way and has convinced me that George R. R. Martin really does know how to tell a story the right way.<br /><br />(This review originally appeared on my website: [...])in trying to deal with all of the places and people and their spacial relations to one another.

B004SJ3BCI|3.0|I agree that the placement of the ads inhibit game play. Usually when I play I put the phone into airplane mode. That helps immensely. Now, there seems to be an issue with the latest updates to AB Free and ad free Rio. I'm using the Motorola Droid2, downloaded the games via the Amazon app store and the updates fail. I've pulled the battery, pulled and installed the SD card, and rebooted the phone, but to no avail. The update was even re-downloaded, but still won't work. Otherwise a 5 star game.
B004QPOVE6|1.0|Hello everyone in Amazon land. This is a video of AC/DC playing live. Not a live video. The editing is extremely poor, with very little continuity. One second the bass player is by his amps, the next his mic. How did he get there so fast? One shot Angus is going up the ramp, the next he is by the singer on stage, lightning quick, I know! This really detracts from the viewing expierience. Boo!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great app! When my Christian friends doubt the atrocities in the bible, now I can pull them up immediately! You should see them squirm! LOL!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really enjoyed this novel. I expected the whole TV show ideal to take a bigger role in this than it really did and for that I'm glad. I'm glad we got to see more of the characters lives rather than a complete focus on the TV show that was clearly created for the enjoyment of the high society.     Also, the concept is quite original and it was cleverly written. It doesn't seem so far fetched either, as I'm sure things like this occurred in history, minus the TV aspect of course.    This is a must read if you enjoy dystopian novels.
B001LF347E|5.0|I discovered this series on Netflix Instant watch and was pleaseantly surprised...The acting is very good, the story lines are well done and it is not a cheap looking made thing like so many series are. It is sort of odd that Guinievere is a maid and i like the dragon that Merlin talks to..sort of reminds me of Dragon Heart....anyway..this series makes one want to keep watching...I would say to definetly watch it..
B0001GMIOE|5.0|I purchased from Eastcoast Servs. I received two genuine Canon batteries in original packaging with manual. Both batteries were fully charged upon arrival.<br /><br />If you are thinking of buying cheaper batteries by another brand DO NOT DO IT! They may be cheaper, but don't last long at all. Canon batteries slowly die off over the years which is expected. All others I have tried slowly die off for a few months then one day completely stop working. It sucks to charge the battery and the next day go to use it and you get nothing!<br /><br />Item came via USPS and signature was required so I missed the delivery and had to pick them up at the post office. It wasn't a problem, just check to see if signature is required when you order.
0345444051|5.0|Many other reviewers here have summarized the plot, so I will not.  I will only say that this novel is an intelligent, thoughtful, beautifully written story about human-alien contact.  I was shocked to find out that it was written in 1958.  Despite its age, the story is timeless.  The story is about the relationship between the humans and aliens, and humanity's 'transformation'.      When the book was finished, I was completely satisfied with the story.  I wasn't left wondering about unfinished plots.  Throughout the book there are mysteries about these aliens that keep you reading, right up to the very end.  But at the end, you are not left wanting.    Beautifully written, engaging, and very satisfying.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This book was amazing.I cried a lot in the last seventy pages,which I think is a good thing because it just goes to show how the author reached out to the reader.    I was not happy about one thing - Gale being completely thrown away in the whole book,but particularly the end.Fancy job in Two.Pft.Horrible explanation when much more could be done with it.    It was a very good end to the series,and although the last few pages were very predictable,they were sweet.
B0032JTV6U|5.0|Another series i discovered on Netflix instant watch and i loved it. I kept watching all the episodes and was wanting more when i watched all of them available.     This series not only is centered on kids who are talented and join the Glee Club despite being the outcasts because they do..but the emotions and conflicts of each student..as well as Will S....including his deceiving wife and the coach of The Cheer leaders/Cheerios who does everything she can to get rid of him and The Glee Club...I do not like her character at all..Sue.....It is sort of sad sometimes with the abuse the kids endure and The Gay Boy whom i feel sorry for..as no one should be judged..we all have a right to make our own choices and live our own lives. The singing and songs are really good..although i was disappointed when they never win The Nationals etc..but maybe the point is not winning easily, but the struggle to get there...But i would highly reccomend watching this series..
0345529057|3.0|I am a little confused. Why is the Kindle version of this series, more expensive than the paperback version? I thought the whole idea of the electronic version was to save money over the expensive paper versions of the books. Am I wrong? Or has Amazon decided that they are losing money on the kindle versions and decided to recoup some of their loses?
B00008O89K|5.0|This is the premiere fantasy soundtrack. It's simply the best. That being said, it is also one of the greatest scores for any genre of film. Can't believe they don't sell the mp3s online. I was grateful for this disc. Out-freakin'-standing!
B0051QO4QY|5.0|This album is a masterpiece.  The only problem with this album is that it was hyped to death.  If this album just came along it would blow everybody away.  There is not an album out right now better than this one.  And I can honestly say it is the best album I've heard in years.  This is not just a superficial pop album.  It is a great work of art and you can tell it was a labor of love.  A lot of hard work went into this and it shows.  It reminds me of Michael Jackson's albums, in that the production is so prestine and perfect.  Standout tracks: Bloody Mary, Electric Chapel, Shiebe, Black Jesus, Edge of Glory.
0307272702|5.0|Two points about this book:<br /><br />1.  The author's thesis is that the current calorie in & calorie out and/or exercise model for weight loss is the wrong message.  We need to look at the science behind obesity and he comes up with some against the grain conclusions:<br />  * Some people simply won't get as lean as they want<br />  * Calories are not the key factor in dieting<br />  * Carbohydrates are the bad guys in causing body fat.<br />  * To manage weight you need to avoid carbs. in all forms and to concentrate on proteins and fats (Yes fats!)<br /><br />2. The research is extremely well documented and summarized and the writing style is superb.<br /><br />A very compelling book!
1613820100|5.0|After reading Woman In White, I was surprised why the author was not as well known as Charles Dickens.  This was the first time I found Victorian classic book could be suspense and mystery besides romance.  Every page made my heart pounding till the end.    Thank you to whoever discarded this great book in our local post office!

B004G600A4|1.0|My Tangled DVD that I purchased through Amazon for my kids was completely scratched when I received it. I'm pretty sure it was a rental that someone tried to pass off as a legitimately bought DVD from a store. It had rental typed on a sticker in the middle of the DVD itself. I tried to play it for my son one day for the first time and it skipped through the whole entire middle of the movie. I will never purchase a used DVD from Amazon again!
0062060554|4.0|I sit here having a hard time writing this review.  Not because the book was bad, because it was really good.  But I just don't know how to describe it's goodness.  It's a very intense book.  The protagonist, Christine, suffers from anteretrograde amnesia where she loses her memory every night as she sleeps.  She wakes up in bed with a man she doesn't know.  He tells her that he's her husband and she was in an accident years ago.  I can't imagine being on either side of this situation.    S.J. Watson did an excellent job showing us how someone would feel waking up every morning with no memory.  I got tense with Christine as she found and read her diary over and over again every day; finding out new things about her past every day, yet forgetting them as she slept.  The author kept the tension building day after day as Christine would remember a little bit more.  S.J. Watson did a great job with the characters, letting us see clearly into Christine and her angst over her life and memory problems, but keeping the other characters just a little bit shady so you couldn't guess what the truth really was.    This was a great read, with twists and turns everywhere.  Just enough to keep you guessing and very entertained!    *Disclaimer:  I received this book from the publisher, HarperCollins, through NetGalley.  I was not required to write a positive review.
1573921394|5.0|During the Great Depression the classical economists said \\"Unemployment is voluntary. Business owners will not voluntarily keep the means of production idle.\\"  While he had been a student of classical economics, John Maynard Keynes observed that the data didn't fit the theory. And, he reasoned, if the observable data don't fit the theory, the theory must be flawed.   \\"Business owners are risk averse,\\" he saw. \\"A new employee needs to be productive, and if no one is buying widgets, then contrary to classical theory, owners will keep capital idle than create excess inventory.\\" (Keyes General Theory of Employement, Interest and Money.)    We see this today.    When unemployment was low, for example in the United States during the tech boom of the 1990's, people acted on the premise that \\"There is so much work that we can hire and good people and train them.\\"  Today hiring managers seem to be acting on the premise that \\"There are so many people looking for work that they can wait for the perfect candidate.\\"     Perfection being unattainable, jobs go unfilled. This is ok, in this context, because:        \\"Budgets are tight.\\"      \\"The future is uncertain.\\"      \\"Money not spent on a new hire can be saved or used to pay down debt.\\"    Keynes also observed that the government is an employer that does not need to worry about going out of business. Building infrastructure is government employment that is investment for the future. These observations are as valid today as they were 80 years ago.
B004WMKSH2|3.0|To begin with, settling down to watch this film, I began to think there had been a mistake. Did they really have to put fifteen minutes of ads for various stupid video games first?  There's even a Lego Harry Potter game!  I was wondering how much it woukld cost to return the thing from Australia before I finally found 'Chapter 7' which seemed to be the actual film.<br />Next time, manufacturer, just give me the film.<br />The film was OK, but only OK.  I'll still buy the finale of course. For a long-time Harry Potter fan, it's obligatory.
0486446859|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo169QTJLBA3BZZ]]I wasn't all that familiar with Arthur Rackham's works to be honest before I purchased this book. I have seen plenty of his art around in older children's books and different fantasy art compilations. I have quite an extensive collection of fairy (faery) and fantasy art books and I think that Arthur Rackham's Treasury was clearly missing from my collection. I was instantly in love with his old fashioned fairy tale illustrations and the muted color tones. I really like how Rachkham's art is somewhat creepy in some aspects, but also magical taking you inside the story behind each piece. It has the depth of each character portrayed in fairy tales in a very complex way. As someone else mentioned, the Alice in Wonderland illustration on the cover was what definitely sold me this book. As far as the quality of paper it was printed on goes, it is so- so. It is rather thin, reminding me of the paper that school textbooks are printed on. However, I was happy to read that I saved several trees with my purchase as it is all recycled paper.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to any and all ages who love fantasy with a twist of the unexpected. I am providing a video to show what is to be expected inside of the book. I know a lot of people are scared to buy something they have never seen before.

0783225482|5.0|I love this movie.  The script is witty and the actors looked like they were having fun.    Luckily I have the Laserdisc version.  It is in Widescreen format and is better quality than the DVD.    I know that studios sometimes misplace their final version of the movie and attempt to clean up one of the best dalies and put it on the market.    Unfair to the consumer.  I will gladly sell them my laserdisc to work from.
B000LC55F2|2.0|This film is as disappointing as \\"The Illusionist\\" is satisfying, surprising, and representative of imaginative movie-making at its best.  By contrast, \\"The Prestige\\" tries to acquire some literary cachet from Edgar Allen Poe and Joseph Conrad doppelganger stories while willfully disregarding the logic of physical reality and blatantly and continuously manipulating the spectator.  Made-for-TV jump-cutting clashes with the agonizing drawn-out final scene in what is a very confusing and confused mish-mash of a film--a betrayal of the unwritten rules that a master like Hitchock would never think of violating.<br /><br />The movie lectures us about the 3-part drama that comprises a master magician's illusion--the set-up, the act (making something disappear), the trick (or \\"Prestige\\"), which is the restoration of the disappearing body.  But the movie ignores the spectator's underlying requirement--viz. the trick must amaze because it occurs in spite of the material limits, or laws of finite existence, with which we are all too familiar.  When the trick passes this \\"reality test,\\" the result is an amazed and delighted spectator who asks \\"how\\" did they do that?  But in the case of \\"The Prestige,\\" which resorts to the \\"deus ex machina\\" principle, or to sheer fantastic \\"sci-fi\\" and \\"weird science\\" devices, the spectator is left asking, merely, \\"why\\" did they do that?  (We'll pass by the smaller questions--i.e. where are we?  what did he just say?--that this pretentious and botched patchwork of a film is bound to provoke. The movie's frantic editing and \\"Method\\"-like acting do little more than expose glaring deficiencies in both areas.)<br /><br />For those who can be content to play with the doppelganger and sacrifice themes (the disappearance requires that someone or something--a bird, for instance--gets snuffed), perhaps there's something to be taken away from the film other than a bad after-taste and greater respect for superior films like \\"The Illusionist\\" and Alfred Hitchcock's masterworks.  As Michael Caine says, \\"We want to be tricked, which requires believing in the illusion.\\"  In this film we believe in everything up to the point of the illusion itself, at which point our suspension of disbelief is no longer possible.  You'd have to be the biggest fan of Roger Corman or, perhaps, Ed Wood to believe in this film's ill-conceived and clumsy manipulations.  It's an Illusion that, however temporarily \\"amazing,\\" fails with a resounding thud, the director mistaking sensation for suspense and pretense for prestige.<br /><br />[For a point-by-point counter-argument to my position (I won't elevate the above response to an \\"argument\\"), see the first commentary (below) by OBrien, who works out the \\"logic\\" of the trick with persuasive if not compelling points--sufficient to suggest that \\"The Prestige\\" not merely rivals the sophistication of \\"The Illusionist\\" but exceeds it!  All the same, I dislike \\"The Prestige\\" (that is, I think I do--it's hard sometimes to know what one likes; one often likes what one comes to know).  I'll add another layer to Obrien's case (though it's his references to the journals that bring it to mind): the film's unusual (and clever) use of multiple narrators, thereby \\"privileging\\" different viewpoints of elusive \\"truth\\" at any given moment, along with written words, or the power of language.  Journals (words) enable any of us to defy the laws of physical reality (we constantly confront the presence of absence with language, restoring to the present the \\"thing\\" that is otherwise no longer physically present to us).<br /><br />So the film may be both ingenious and deeply philosophical (thereby refuting my position that it resorts to common deus ex machina, sci-fi, sensational devices).  But consider, again, the difference (aside from camera work, acting, sets, form) between the two similar films.  In \\"The Illusionist\\" two childhood friends/lovers are separated and the protagonist-magician ultimately realizes his \\"obsession\\" of bringing her back from the void.  He tells her he loves her and will bring her back into his life--and he pulls off this seemingly impossible \\"trick\\" (the viewer may, if he/she wishes, attribute all to the power of love, though everything is logically explained.  \\"The Prestige\\" is a beast of a different order.  The magician Borden tells his wife that he loves her and she answers: \\"Sometimes you say that and don't mean it, which is all right because it makes sweeter the times when you actually do mean it.\\"  \\"Prestige\\" is a word that has little to do with love and everything to do with power and, more importantly, \\"pride\\" (or that deadly nemesis \\"hubris\\").  \\"The Prestige,\\" in other words, is driven by the obsessive pride of two competing magicians who will go to all lengths to make the rival disappear, thereby realizing the not-so-magnificent obsession of either one.  I suspect I'm not alone in my preferred obsession: I'll reserve my 5-star rating for the magician who will put everything on the line to make his beloved reappear.]from the void.

B004EPYZOY|2.0|Nicolas Cage can be hot and cold.  He has some great movies like raising arizona, but has some realy duds too.  If your getting this for the blu ray 3D then its not worth it. I have a Samsung 53\\" Led TV. This movie didn't look so great in 3D. I watched the movie but the 3d was bad, There where some cool scenes with some good effects but over all I was disappointed with the 3D. I really hope the studios can start making some good live action films that pop, I know it can be done I watch the imax river 3d movie and the opening scene with the  was a big suprise, if only the movie could be more consistanly good..
0441013597|3.0|It is easy to forget that Herbert wrote in a time when the Sci-Fi universe was sparsely populated, with technology based on analog vacuum tubes and such. The dazzling world of Arrakis & its worms, space travel technology etc are  original and reflect raw imagination and talent. SOme aspects of Robert Jordan's Aes Sedai seem eerily similar to Herbert's Bene Gesserit.<br /><br />I couldn't relate to the all-knowing all-powerful main character who seemed too uni-dimensional to be interesting. literal use of Arabic, Slavonic, Chakobsa, Persian etc was disconcerting and jarring.  much of the pseudo-philosophical mumbo jumbo in Dune seems to have been lifted straight from hallucinogenic trances - the book  at times sounded like a diary from a druggie, complete with rapid review of the past and the future. Not surprisingly, the threat of diminished drug supply as a literary device was lifted straight out of another fiend's (Crowley's) oeuvre.<br /><br />Historically speaking this book was ground breaking. Personally, I wasn't as touched as I expected to be.

B000001GG6|1.0|I just purchased and promptly received this set from one of Amazon's outside vendors only to find in my utter despair and frustration that one of the performers--assume it is the pianist! as they are invariably the culprits in these situations, like that high IQ eccentric pain Gould ruining so many Bach keyboard recordings--was HUMMING! MUMBLING! Was so distracting totally ruined the music since it happened in every movement, no relief from concerto to concerto. How did the geniuses at DG let this fatal flaw go by? Am very angry since I passionately wanted this set given my worship of these concertos and current determination to collect multiple versions of them. A pox on the pianist who ruined this for me since the miking suggests he is indeed the villain rather than Mr. Bersnstein.
0439023521|5.0|We're still coyly holding back from game shows with fights to the death, but they are obviously a great idea, as proven by Stephen King in _The Long Walk_ and then again by Stephen King in _The Running Man_. He of course raved this book, as do I, because Collins takes it into the 21st century where the contestants play to the camera for more sponsors.<br /><br />Katniss is modern action hero in this book, because she recognizes it's not enough to be tough and smart, you also have to make yourself look good. She raises a boring love triangle to the next level with her \\"I don't care if you're into me, I'm making love to the camera because WITHOUT RATINGS I DIE!\\" attitude. Even Ender Wiggin might not have thought of that.
1600242405|2.0|I'm not a huge Stones fan but do enjoy their music.  I was looking forward to hearing this audio until I realized that there are 20 discs!  Then I found out the print version is over 500 pages long!  After listening to the story, it was apparent to me that the middle half could've easily been pared way down, as it was the \\"sex-drugs-rock n roll\\" story over and over again.  Basically getting high, getting girls, and playing music over and over again; it simply became boring.  I did enjoy the first part detailing KR's young life and how the band came together.  The last disc seemed to be KR rambling about whatever came to mind--dogs wandering on stage, having Paul McCartney appear at his home unannounced, his brain surgery--and it was enjoyable to listen to what came across as an everyday guy.  The audio has three narrators; Johnny Depp's voice work was GREAT.  Despite the shortfalls, I did like the story; just think it could've been much shorter and still got the job done.

0316056863|5.0|Things I most enjoyed:    1) Explaining what Lorne Michaels does so well and why it works.  (Gripe all you want about how SNL hasn't been funny since the first time you got to stay up late, but it still beats the heck out of any other sketch show.)    2) Amy Poehler's role in changing the landscape of the SNL team.  Turns out she was Leslie Knoping the place up all along and we didn't even know it.    Tina, allow me to explain in writing: the deal with apple butter is, it's the ideal topping for vanilla ice cream.  Get a good Amish variety (I prefer Hartman's from Berlin Ohio, your mileage may vary) and go nuts.
0762434279|1.0|Read during two extended trips in a waiting room. The financial advice mixes obvious facts with nonsense, which can be confirmed in the Jonathan Clements review in the Wall Street Journal (\\"Rich Men, Poor Advice: Their Book Is Hot, But Their Financial Tips Aren't\\") or the Rob Walker overview in Slate (\\"If I Were a Rich Dad: Why millions buy Rich Dad, Poor Dad's nonsense\\").    Of more concern to me was the moral bile. The whole lesson of the book is that rich people should be idolized, poor people are ignorant, the government is stupid and out to get you, and if you work for a living you're a fool. Rich dad brags about underpaying his employees and then blames them for their own low wages. In setting up the poor dad as a loser and the rich dad as a hero, he includes the following nonsense:     \\"Poor people are more greedy than rich people.\\"     \\"Don't listen to poor people.\\"     \\"People with low self-esteem can never be rich.\\"     \\"For example, [poor dad] would say, 'The love of money is the root of all evil.' [Rich dad], 'The lack of money is the root of all evil.'\\"     \\"My poor dad would also say, 'I'm not interested in money,' or 'Money doesn't matter.' My rich dad always said, 'Money is power.'\\"
0767827791|3.0|Wonderful movie, great performances, but what idiot decided     1) to crop this 2+:1 \\"super widescreen\\" film to 1.33:1 vacuum tube TV shape (and when was the last time you saw one of *those* in use..?)    2) while leaving the opening credits at the original 2+:1 widescreen - apparently to rub our noses in it?    Our British cousins have less patience with this idiocy, and Amazon UK has a Region 2 PAL DVD of Picnic listed as \\"16:9 - 2.35:1\\" which is mathematical nonsense, but I think means it plays a 2.35:1 image on your 16x9 widescreen TV - filling it from side to side with black space above and below, so you can see the entire original picture.     So...For this and many other American widescreen movies which aren't available in a Region 1 Widescreen DVD, pick up an \\"all-region\\" DVD player and buy your DVDs in the UK.     Note: This is only a real problem with the \\"super-widescreen\\" movies, as many/most (or possibly all) of the \\"modest\\" (1.66:1, 1.85:1) widescreen movies were shot full screen and intended to be masked in projection. Zoom them to fill the width of your 16:9 TV and you're pretty much back where you should be.
B004G6009U|5.0|I had the good fortune to take my two eldest daughters to this movie at the theater to see it in 3D. It was my 4 year old's first theater experience. We all absolutely loved the movie! My girls adored the entire thing. Disney actually breaks tradition with their princess style stories on this movie. While Rapunzel is drawn in the typical Disney style, glamour has little to do with this movie and Rapunzel shows great modesty in her dress and her attitude. There is a smidgen of romance here, but the romance is not the point of Rapunzel's quest. Rapunzel's dream is about her destiny, it's not to find a perfect prince or to be swept off her feet. In Rapunzel, we have a strong girl who is torn between this tugging that draws her to something that she truly believes is somehow meant for her and her desire to do the right thing and honor her \\"mother's\\" wishes. She's strong, confident, witty, charmingly naive and yet not gullible. Mandy Moore's voice acting talents here are just phenomenal... full of emotion, spirit, and just the right bits at the right time... truly impressive work.<br /><br />We've now seen it twice on Blu-Ray and my girls love it even more (they insist on watching it again). It's only a matter of time before I'll have to buy it for them.<br /><br />My only minor complaint is in Flynn Rider. To a certain extent he continues this tradition of male characters who are designed to be debonair but with little substance and would continue a life of emptiness as a criminal if not for the love of the fair maiden. Zachary Levi does a fabulous job voicing Flynn and you can't help but like him, but there is a concern here that it sends the \\"bad boys are cool\\" message that seems prevalent in so many places. My girls are very young and I've been able to talk them through some of this and will obviously need to continue to help them see that typically, good girls don't reform bad boys - it's usually the other way around.<br /><br />Eventually, we learn why he's the way he is and though it is a nice bit of candor, it's a plot device to help us get past this character's penchant for criminal hi-jinks and adventure. But, hey, this is a fairy tale and that is a hyper-sensitive analysis of the characters in a children's movie. So, my 5-star review stands. Overall, it does little to color the movie which is simply another Disney \\"happily ever after\\" fairy tale. There is great value in the warm fuzzy feel-good stories that Disney has excelled at telling all of these years. Reality sets in for everyone and, as parents, it's our job to help our children navigate the waters of reality... but fairy tales are great places where hope and imagination run free. It's good for the soul.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie. Even I loved it... really!

Simply put, Loomis' books (including the re-release of Drawing the Head and Hands) are some of the best drawing books ever published.<br /><br />Loomis may not be a common name to artists these days, but he greatly influenced generations of artists from the 1940's to the present. Comic book fans need only look at the works of Steve Rude and Alex Ross to see what I mean.<br /><br />Coupled with Loomis' friendly approach to teaching the subject matter and his gorgeous illustration style, this is a purchase well worth making!<br /><br />Now if only Titan would re-release Creative Illustration, his seminal work...
B003TJR2HS|3.0|I bought this unit at the same time as a longer Cable Jive cable. In all honesty, I much prefer the longer cable and am able to use this unit only with my Sony shelf unit to dock my Iphone while it's in the Otterbox Defender case. It's not heavy duty enough to dock my Ipad to the Sony without feeling like everything is going to be bent/damaged. Can't use it all with Ipad/Ihome combo, because Ipad is too big to attach to Ihome dock with this little gizmo. The longer cables definitely offer more versatility and provide more bang for your buck.

B002ZG981E|5.0|If you want to fully understand this movie you must pay attention to every detail. Even though some may not like that, it is worth it as the plot is well thought out and the timeline jumps back and forth to compare the then with the now.

B004QITJC2|5.0|Wow I saw the video for \\"On Earth As It Is In Hell\\" and loved the song and the band seemed to know exactly what they were doing...now that I've heard the whole album there's only one word to describe it...AMAZING!!!!  This album is just so well thought out and recorded the guitar shredding alone...the riffs and harmony guitars are enough to get any respectable head banger smilling...the singer is totally off the wall but you get used to his theatrical style vocals as they fit perfectly to the theme and music.  These guys are destined to be huge if they can keep making albums as good as this...\\"Human Remains\\" is one of those rare albums that 20 years down the road people will still be calling this a classic of it's time.
B003W5C0VW|5.0|I was able to see the Stones about 10 years ago. They were awesome in concert! Great show! I wanted them to play a show in my living room but that was too expensive, so I starting looking for a Stones concert DVD.    A friend let me borrow the \\"Four Flicks\\" DVD, which basically mirrors what I saw in concert about 10 years ago. It is an excellent collection of concert footage. But, as great as Four Flicks is, I wanted to see what the Stones were like back in the day, in their \\"prime\\" (which is hard to define since they STILL put on awesome shows). So, I continued my search.    Then I found \\"Ladies & Gentlemen... The Rolling Stones\\", shot as a film in 1972 during the tour to promote \\"Exile on Main Street\\". I bought the DVD and just watch it last night. It was just what I wanted. It is a stripped-down, raunchy, version of the Stones. No backing vocals (other than Keith Richards sharing the microphone with Mick Jagger, which is pretty cool). No big stage or lighting. Just a solid performance from one of the greatest rock bands ever. The bonus interviews were cool as well (it contains a 2010 version of Mick Jagger talking about the film).    So, if you have seen the Stones lately and want that big stage, big lighting, more \\"mature\\" version of the Stones, buy \\"Four Flicks\\". If you want a solid, raunchy, \\"younger\\" version of the Stones, buy \\"Ladies & Gentlemen... The Rolling Stones\\".

B001AQIYJC|5.0|This is a classic movie that i've watched so many times before and never get tired of it. I love this movie. What more is there to say? Watch it, if you hate it, then you do. If not, then you'll always love it. Sometimes it makes me wonder if an angel watches over me. I would have fallen too, just to be with the one I love.
B0055WRFKG|4.0|Having read some of the reviews from top line critics (including the downright ridiculous one from Roger Ebert), I decided to given this film a chance through Wal-Mart's exclusive steel book release. This item includes a Blu-Ray disc of the movie with features and a second disc that is a standard DVD with just the feature (Probably identical to the disc that is availabe in a RedBox).<br /><br />Jon Liebesman's fourth feature is his best, though that's not exactly putting the movie on a very tall pedestal. I really have wanted to get behind this guy because he really seems committed to creating strong genre films; unfortunately, his previous horror themed efforts (including the studio botch \\"Darkness Falls\\" and Platinum Dunes' \\"Texas Chainsaw Massacre: the Beginning\\") just weren't very good. His last feature, a DTV effort called \\"the Killing Room\\" was good enough that I was willing to trust Liebesman to take me through yet another alien invasion.<br /><br />Lets get this out of the way early: \\"Battle\\" Los Angeles\\" is NOT a great movie. It's not \\"Platoon\\" and it's not \\"Aliens.\\" But this movie is an entertaining two hour ride that pulls together several eye catching action scenes around a central character conflict that--while not ground breaking--is enough to buoy a simple, straight forward story.<br /><br />I found it refreshing to see a Sci-Fi movie that portrays the military as a group of honorable individuals that are still human. These soldiers are not emotionless plot devices or ham-fisted idiots: they act like REAL people. This is in sharp contrast to recent movies like \\"Super 8\\" or \\"X-Men: Fist Class\\" where the same tired 'corrupt military' plot thread is dredged from the grave to create a human antagonist for a fantastic story.<br /><br />The style of the movie is akin to \\"Black Hawk Down\\" and used a lot of shaky-Cam. Some people really do not like this style of filmmaking, but I thought it was perfectly suited for this story and dutifully brought to life the \\"frantic\\" nature of the story.<br /><br />The acting was mostly harmless with the exception of Aaron Eckhart, who did a phenomenal job in the central role. He did a dead on version of an uptight vet I know and the character was easy to identify with.<br /><br />Not much is ever found out about the alien race beyond what is relevant to the characters we're following and while I would've liked to know more about the alien race (they had a unique look that reminded me of Black Manta), it was the better artistic choice to keep the viewer in the dark. Because we no so little, the aliens become more imposing. It also allows the characters to make suppositions about their situation and develop their personalities beyond broad stereotypes (most of them don't get much development; however, we are thrown into a combat situation fairly quickly and I thought they did an admirable job of giving the more important characters brief moments to thicken). The movie doesn't stonewall itself to force developing characters, which can be considered a plus or a minus depending on what you want in a movie.<br /><br />In the end, this is just two hours of fun. I remember when I was a kid this was the movie I always wanted to see: Soldiers versus monsterous beings in all out combat. It's not \\"Aliens,\\" but it does more right than wrong and resists temptation to fall into the one cliche I hoped it would avoid: making the military look like nothing more than a bunch of immoral, heartless robots.<br /><br />I can now honestly say that I'm looking forward to Liebesman's next effort and have a movie with his name on it that I can recommend to other people.The acting was mostly harmless with the exception of Aaron Eckhart, who did a phenomenal job in the central role.

030746363X|4.0|This is a great book to read to get motivated to lose weight, get in shape, build muscle, etc. However, if you're already on a good workout program you'll mainly find some interesting information, but nothing that will completely blow you're mind. It is a great read. Tim does a great job of explaining really complex information while still keeping it entertaining. He shares several different plans (diet/exercise/supplements) depending on what your goal is, which I like, because not everyone just needs to lose weight (although most American's do!). I'm trying to put on weight in the form of muscle, so I like that there were chapters on that. My wife really liked the sections on weight loss and diet, and it really got her motivated. She's already lost 5 lbs in only a week.    Tim's Slow Carb Diet is good. It's basically Paleo, with two exceptions: add beans, and take out fruit. [[ASIN:0470913029 Here's a great Paleo Diet book.]] Tim recommends one cheat day per week, which is great, because most diets are hard to stay on in our culture. My wife already eat mainly Paleo, and take one cheat day a week, so this was nothing new for us.    One part I wasn't too impressed with (and why I'm only giving 4 stars) is the mass building chapters. Tim recommends \\"Occam's Protocol.\\" In a nut shell, you alternate 2 pairs of full-body movements: Yates Row/Overhead Press and Incline Bench/Squat, with moderate to heavy weight, move at a slow count, and only perform one set to failure. That's it, one pair one day, the other a few days later. The good part is it's simple, I just don't think it was enough for me. I had been doing Crossfit for a few months and seeing great results, but decided to experiment with this. I only lasted 2 weeks and saw my muscle mass and energy level decrease, so I dropped it like a bad habit and got back on the Crossfit wagon and haven't looked back. This may work if you're not seeing results with you're workout, or are not sure where to start, but for me Crossfit's where it's at!    In summary, it's a good place to start. The diet is good. The weight loss information seems to be working for my wife. As for mass building, if you're already seeing results with your workout routine you may not get much more than an interesting read out of this book.
1442419814|2.0|The premise was interesting, but none of the characters have any personality! Everyone in this novel is 2-dimensional, making them utterly boring. I can't take any more of this, I won't continue with the rest of the series
159514188X|5.0|I just finished reading this book and was totally blown away. It is EXTREMELY well written, and there is a great balance of commentary by one of the main characters, Hannah Baker, and the other main character, Clay's reaction, which really makes it interesting. Thirteen Reasons Why is about the struggles of a high school girl who is dealing with rumors and peoples views of her. She becomes depressed and commits suicide before anyone can properly help her. Before she dies she leaves behind thirteen stories about thirteen people who influenced her decision to kill herself. This book helped put my actions in perspective. I realized that just the smallest rudeness toward someone may seem a lot bigger to than they may show at the time, and it might influence them well into the future. It also simply and clearly talked about what to do to help depressed people. This book is an amazing and touching story of a young girl and the reasons behind her suicide.
B004RE29PO|5.0|Aliens looks excellent on Blu-Ray. The picture is exceedingly sharp and the sound is excellent. If you like this movie you owe it to yourself to get it on Blu-Ray.
B004IFYMWK|5.0|It is time for us to evolve and disconnect from the fear mongering that wreaks havoc in our lives, our communities, our countries, our planet, and our universe.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|I cannot immediately think of another book that made me think on every page in such a thoroughly enjoyable way. Whether or not one agrees with every conclusion Gladwell draws from the data he has amassed. or even with his basic premise that we are all products of our contexts and connections and not simply the sum total of our own efforts, it is worthwhile to have common assumptions challenged. The examples are many and wide-ranging, the interviews interesting, and the tone both energetic and ironic. His points have stayed with me and I'm interested to follow up some of the references given. The personal touch of the Epilogue fit with the book as a whole as well as affording insight about its conception. All in all. captivating.
B004047XXO|4.0|This review is for the green-pink glasses movie on DVD. The 3D on this movie was wonderful. Naturally the colors were washed out with the glasses but the effect was great. Very little ghosting and wonderful depth to the picture. Very pleased with the 3D.     Now down to the story. I don't think the cast even had a script for the first 30 minutes of the film. This franchise was worn out after the first movie but to stretch it this far is a joke. The cast seemed to ad-lib the first half of the movie until a new character was introduced. Then it got interesting. Not the kind of movie I would pay to see but on the cheap is a good one to watch at home. (Because you can turn it off.)
B004E0Z4XK|2.0|This is just ok.  If Jack White had not made a contribution then it would be very average indeed.  Some tracks can be imagined to be included on a soundtrack at some point but generally it is just like rice pudding......nice but nothing mind blowing.
B004H22RTY|5.0|Great transfer to blu-ray. The image is sharp as a knife but wish the story was better. Love seeing Mila but for videogamers we have gone past her story. Time for Chris to shine a little. I know this was released when blu-ray 3-D was told to us was popular but no one in my town has bought into it. This would have been good in anaglyph but wasn't released as such. Still, in 2D it works well and the high-def content is great. A definite buy if you are following the story.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|It's a great game but I think there's a memory leak.  It makes the game slow very noticeably over time.  If you play long enough, your phone will fully freeze.

0307887960|5.0|I love the Dukan Diet book.  I have been on this diet for three weeks and have lost a little over 12 pounds.  I would have lost more weight but have gone out to eat with friends at times. Even with going out I have stayed close to what is on the diet and still am loosing, but more slowly. The only problem that I have is constipation; therefore, have added a little fruit before I am suppose to.  I do eat the Bran with the Greek yogurt, but for me it does not completely take care of the problem. The main thing is I feel wonderful.
159514188X|5.0|4.5 stars<br /><br />I'm not sure why I waited so long to read this book, and let just say this book is powerful as it's one that will make you think. It will make you think about things you did to others as a teen and it will make you think about the things you do now, even the little things that can and do effect people for better or worse. Thirteen Reasons Why took me back to high school and made me think about all things that happened then. The good, the bad and everything in between. It's not just the big things that effect people, but it's the little things that we don't even think of that can change someone's life, like the story's main character Hannah points out.<br /><br />This is the first book I've read by Jay Asher and what a phenomenal job he's done with Hannah's story. Not only is the book from her perspective via the tapes she has sends to those who effective her life before she killed herself telling them how they did so, but it's also told from Clay's point of view. His thoughts and feelings are played out as he wonders when he'll be mentioned on the tapes, and why. Like those before him, he wants to know what it was that he did to make Hannah do what she did. Through Clay's listening to the tapes I felt like I got to know Hannah more. Her story is heartbreaking, intense, sad and I couldn't help but want to reach out to her in so many ways.<br /><br />Like Clay, I wondered how no one started to see the signs. It was so heartbreaking knowing all that Hannah endured with the vicious rumors, and lies that were going around about her and her withdrawal from everyone. It was frustrating that no one did anything to tell her she could get through this, or to say they were sorry. I wanted so badly to tell Hannah she was better than they were and she was stronger than she knew she was. This is a book I highly recommend to teenage readers and fans of YA. It will make you realize that the things we say and do, no matter how insignificant we think it is will/can have a lasting impression on people. The story also proves that it takes one person to speak up to be the support that someone else may need to change their life for the better. This is a thought provoking book with a powerful message and I highly recommend picking it upan have a lasting impression on people.

B0041LG08U|5.0|The watch arrived as promised and was expertly packed and absolutely brand new. The on-line photos do not do this watch justice. A no-brainer considering the price. Buyers should note,however, that this is a \\"diver style\\" watch as opposed to a true divers watch. the crown is a non screw down and the WR is 100 meters. OK for me though as I don't wear watches in the water.
B002CAWNDS|4.0|This movie seemed like a combination of Jungle Fever, with a twist of Fatal Attraction, and Wall Street, all in one. I liked the strong commitment minded role Derek portrayed of rejecting Lisa's advances. Usually these interracial plots are portrayed in the script, by weak black men characters. Black men that are desperate, and on a mission to get with white women. And eventually permanently taking themselves off the dating market of availability, towards black women. Black men portrayed as big, strong, and dumb, with jungle fever.<br /><br />It was refreshing to see a strong, committed, black family man, finally resist a white woman for a change. Refreshing to see him stay loyal to his marriage, and try to keep his family together. It was especially uplifting to see that Derek was successful, and nowhere near as insecure, or as weak like Tiger Woods. (The self-proclaimed Cau-Blin-Asian). The Tiger Woods type would have quickly given in to Lisa, by grinning and pretending, and secretly fornicating with this woman, to escape his obvious blackness.<br /><br />Derek was the perfect example of what to do when you are tall, dark, handsome, financially successful, being pursued, stalked, bullied, by an overly aggressive woman. I was hoping that Derek did not give up, nor give in to Lisa. She had a smile that could win over the weak, she had very sexy, and graceful, body language, with natural rhythm. She was very convincing for the mentally ill part that she portrayed. Beyonce showed the ugly disrespectful side of some black women, and why some successful black men gravitate to other women. Beyonce expected Derek to remain faithful to her, while he was put out the house and suffering emotionally, all while he kept a roof over her head.<br /><br />In real life situations, most unemployed wives, would not put their six figure salary husbands out for 3 months, after just purchasing their first dream home. I found out the Executive Producers of the film also included BeyonceKnowles, and basket ball great Magic Johnson. They've continued the cinematic expectation, exploitation, and mammy-fication, of the angry black woman syndrome. Beyonce blinded herself to the truth of Derek's complete innocence, and showed excessive anger, insecurity, cursing out, fussing, behavior just as mentally unstable, and unpredictable, as Lunatic Lisa. When the movie first came on, Beyonce played difficult to get in bed, and was trying to get out of knowing Derek.<br /><br />The ultimate showdown between Beyonce and Lisa, was not believable on behalf of Beyonce's weak script. Beyonce offered her kind hand, in a last ditch effort to save Lisa from falling over 30 feet to her death, when the attic floor caved in. Lisa had invaded Beyonce's home, and was trying to kill her, and Beyonce decided to try and save Lisa's life. Executive producer Beyonce, gave herself the script of playing a good samaritan, by trying to save Lisa as she dangled from the high ceiling. Lisa decided to grab Beyonce's hand, but not to save herself, but to try and pull Beyonce down also, so both would fall to their deaths, and neither would be with Derek. The attitude that if I can't have him, you can't live to have him either.<br /><br />Overall a different outcome of a growing black men, white women phenomenon. Idris Elba was the perfect actor for the part of Derek, Ali Larter was the perfect actress for the part of Lisa. Beyonce unknowingly played the perfect part to explain why some black women, force black men to bolt out the back door, to be with other women. The baby did not look like Derek or Beyonce, could have ever been his parents. The movie looked great on Blu-ray, and the soundtrack was mysterious but perfect, for the fatal attraction, demented role that Lisa portrayed very convincingly.
B00457X7XQ|5.0|I heard about this book when listening to the Security Now podcast.  I found it to be a good read and enjoyed it.  There is a little language in the book and some references to sex that I didn't feel were needed for the story, but not overly explicit either.  Nice to read a book written by something that knows their technology.  There were very few errors (grammer, spelling).
076790592X|1.0|I found this book to be ridiculously cliche in every sense of the word.  Morrie's dying, and talks about all the important things he learned in his life.  Death, family, money, and culture are discussed and explained through his eyes, and ultimately, the same few sentences show up at the end of every chapter: \\"Love is the most important thing.  Money doesn't matter.\\"  Honestly, I don't think it takes a dying man to preach these lessons.  Everyone has heard these things before.  They're nothing new.  Just because Morrie is dying doesn't mean he knows what he's talking about or that these ideas have more weight than they usually would - they're still the same old cliches that we've been hearing since we were kids.<br /><br />What's more, the author seems to have written this book as if he not only knows but expects that everyone will bow down to the story and revel in it and call it an inspiration.  It takes a haughty tone, and almost alienates readers by its message that whatever you're doing in life is probably meaningless.  I mean, sure, it would be great to drop everything and spend your life with your family and loved ones, but, here's the thing: LIFE DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY.  Everyone has to work.  Everyone has to suffer.  Albom writes as if Morrie is God, and whatever comes out of his mouth makes total sense and has a deep meaning.  The only way that I can at least try to relate to this is if I think about my favorite teachers of years past and try to imagine writing a book about them.  And only then do I find a small bit of understanding of why this book was even written.<br /><br />I honestly do not understand the praise this book has received.  If you're dying, it might be a comfort to read something about a man who is supposedly not afraid of death.  But otherwise, why be taught elementary lessons that are presented in an extremely pretentious fashion?
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I bought the Trilogy for my Kindle 3.  I like it very much, and will give my initial review below (I haven't yet finished reading the first book in the series, The Hunger Games).  But I wanted to warn Kindle owners that the trilogy edition (I can't speak for the separated books) apparently has a font instruction embedded.  When you first open the book the font will be very large and you will have to adjust it with the font button (Aa).  Well and good, but apparently the font instruction is embedded again in different areas of the book, sometimes at the beginning of a chapter.  So you will have to adjust it again.  Kind of annoying, especially if you read several books at once and are having to adjust those books too, every time you switch from the Trilogy.<br /><br />As for the book itself, I find it highly addictive.  Each chapter ends with a cliffhanger, so don't start reading it if there is something else you should really be doing.  It's not literature like Dickens of course, or even Harry Potter, but it is several notches above such romance-genre suspense and fantasy novels like Discovery of Witches (which I also enjoyed) and the Highlander series (which I could not stomach).  Our hero is a feisty, strong, likable, emotional young woman and she needs to be all of this to survive.  It's a suspenseful fantasy and a dystopian survivor tale with a lot of video-game-like images, which are not too blatant.  I make this point because the video game feel might be appealing to boys, even though the main character is a girl.<br /><br />Written in first person.

0982743726|5.0|Having read books like LoTR and the entire GRRM - Song of Ice and Fire series I am well read in the areas of high fantasy. However, often times I do not want to commit myself to several volumes of 1000+ page books. I was immediately attracted to The Bone Sword. It is a relatively short novel but I enjoyed every single page of it. I highly recommend it to anyone who is craving a fantasy romp and doesn't want to commit to a 5000 page multi-volume tome. It has likable heroes and grotesque villains. It has just enough treachery and violence. All in all it's just an enjoyable book. I look forward to follow ups from this new author, Walter Rhein.

B0036TGSR6|5.0|Polanski is one of the greatest film makers alive.  Beyond the perfect details and intricate stories, most of his films add new possibilities to the genres he operates in.  He re-made the film noire with China Town, introducing characters with far greater depth than in typical whodunnits, complete with an explosive political situation that ended in tragedy.  Now with this political thriller, in which an everyman finds himself in an extraordinary situation like Cary Grant in N by NW, Polanski again deepens the themes with tragedy, romance, and distrust.  There are so many levels to this film that I will be able to watch innumerable times and always see more.  It is some of the best film work available.<br /><br />The plot involves a ghost writer who is hired to fix the memoires of Lang, a Blair-like figure who recently has left power.  The original ghost writer, who washed up on shore dead and full of alcohol, was Lang's most trusted aide.  The new ghost is a political naif, extremely skilled at helping non-writers to find a story line, but largely ignorant of the world of national security and spies.  Upon investigation, he finds discrepancies in what Lang is telling him:  dates don't match up, the narrative makes little sense, and the tension in Lang's temporary residence is palpable.  Lang's wife, a first-rate politico and extraordinarily beautiful middle-aged woman, is extremely bitter at the affair that he is having with a younger aide.  When charges of violating international law brings protestors to the remote island, the ghost finds some strange documents by chance, setting him on a different path of investigation - which he is not there to do.  Needless to say,  he enters very dangerous teritory almost unawares, until he begins to fear for his own life.<br /><br />Behind this are wonderfully fecund themes.  Lang, as played by Brosnin, is a fascinating figure:  at once left-leaning and charismatic, he is also manipulative and enigmatic, perhaps a lier or worse.  You cannot trust anything he says, but his presence is commanding and decisive.  It is a study of a leader who is out and what happens once their secrets are no longer protected by their office.  Then there is his wife, whose subtle intelligence and guile are hidden behind her bitterness and seemingly pure motives to work as her husband's most trusted advisor.  She feels betrayed and is perhaps seeking revenge, yet appears lonely and betrayed, abandoned after a lifetime of devoted marriage.  She too may not be what the viewer is led to think.  The ghost is clearly out of his league, yet cannot help himself from getting dangerously enmeshed as events gather momentum.<br /><br />Polanski's handling of the situation is so deft that the viewer can be deceived, in my opinion.  Sure, the ghost figures out a version of what is going on and pays for it, but is it the whole story?  It is impossible to know.  What is clear is that he stupidly overplays his hand rather than waits for the right moment as only a pol would know how to do.  I write this cryptically because I don't want to reveal the surprises in store for the attentive viewer.<br /><br />This is one of the best thrillers I have ever seen.  The mood throughout is one of melancholy and bewilderment from the ghost's point of view, of gathering forces so far beyond his comprehension that he appears stupid.  Recommended with the greatest enthusiasm.  This is one of Polanski's best films.rust anything he says, but his presence is commanding and decisive.

B004VFYOA2|5.0|C'mon, people! This was TAPED 21 years ago. T A P E D !!! As in video tape. No digital cameras. No 2011 technology. Most of my favorite bands from the 80's never video taped anything, so for this to exist in any form is a huge plus for me. My iPod and my Sony Cyber-shot digital photo camera record better video than what existed in 1990. I have bootleg concerts recorded within the past few months that look professional compared to this, but the technology in 2011 affords us that. This is a piece of rock history. This is a great concert. A great band. A great DVD to own. I personally love it and enjoyed watching it. I just saw Whitesnake 3 weeks ago and they ROCKED! Get over the quality and enjoy the DVD for what it is - a place in time we'll never get back to. These great, real rock bands aren't going to be around forever. Too soon these DVDs will be our only salvation in a world of boring, cookie-cutter, flavor-of-the-week rock music.
0762434279|2.0|The first few chapter were engaging and enlightening, however the book quickly became repetitive.  I'll summarize the points covered in this book:    1 - most of the material goods in your life (including your home) are liabilities-- they keep you in debt and chasing paychecks.  2 - you want to build the assets in your life and create positive cash flow (assets are things like real estate that bring in money without you have to do any work).  3 - when you eventually have enough assets to cover the cost of your expenses, you won't have to work anymore whee!    But this book is misleading and dangerous to many.  Real estate investing is very competitive and very hard work... rarely do paychecks just \\"roll in\\" until you've had years and year of experience and an excellent team you're build during these years... In essence, for those successful in real estate investing, it is their full time JOB and they have to stay on top of their investments.  Kiyosaki's book offers no clear direction on how to be successful and escape the \\"rat race.\\"  Where does Kiyosaki get most of his riches from? That's right-- his books, promotional material, and motivational talks.    I gave his book 2 stars because I liked the points about liabilities and assets-- makes you think twice before going out to buy the latest TV or a bigger house.  But these principles are in other books as well, such as The Millionaire Next Door.  This book wasn't anything groundbreaking if you've been reading other motivational wealth-related books.
B00005JLEX|2.0|So many successful, even classic sitcoms had a rough start. Very few exceptions: The Dick Van Dyke Show, The Odd Couple, et. al.<br /><br />Seinfeld went through major changes in approach around 1994-95 and it was fior the better: we went from a funny show centered around a hip comedian who pulls material from his quirky West Side friends who report to him on crazy West Side events. The first two seasons were very \\"stagy\\", very self-conscious, in the \\"please love us\\" syndrome. I think Michael Richards was the real \\"glue\\", shall we say. Jason Alexander is the new Woody Allen; Jerry's acting is generally atrocius. Writing..mediocre. Editing often bad, especially cutaways to gaga audience members in the thankfully thrown away prefacing bit - Jerry on staqe; to Elaine, the ex-girlfriend still dazzled by his wit.<br /><br />Male Unbonding, The Deal, The Pony Remark, The Heart Attack...all have 1-2 memorable lines but are very weak.<br /><br />For the deep fan, a ***; for the casual fan a **; a great compensator is the extras - definitely the most entertaining feature.<br /><br />I want to add that for those middle of the road fans, who just like to wait for the classics, and there are countless in that category starting in 1994 and going to the next to last season, this is completely unnecessary, unless the commentary, etc., is of value. This was a long way away from the masterpieces with the new characters Peterman, The Costanzas, Susan; with a sensational appearance by Marissa Tomei and other notables. And, very importantly, the emergence of Jerry Seinfeld as one of the greatest sitcom actors, ever!

B004EPZ07K|4.0|This movie although it is no iron man or thor is still a very enterntaining movie and their is a lot to like about this movie. (I'am sorry but i still can not get over how sorry and i do mean sorry and boy when i say sorry i do mean sorry about how superman returns was as a movie) but thats another story anyway this movie starts of with hal jordan a fighter pilot who winds up geting a ring that can use green light to create solid objects i was a little surpised to see that senestro was one of the good guys in this movie I kind of thought that this was a live action movie of green lantern first flight which is another great animated feature film. If you do not expect super high explosive action movie (there is a lot of action but not to much) then this can be a good film to watch it is not boring by any means i just was expecting more then their was but it is still a great film to watch.

B000P0J09C|5.0|Stanley Kubrick's film is spectacular and defies easy description. The film is divided into two parts that are clearly distinct. The first is the Parris Island training base for Marines and the second is in Viet Nam during the Tet offensive. In the first section we see how young men are turned into soldiers and in the second section we see how they perform under real war conditions. Yet there is a dark undercurrent that in the first section asks why such extreme techniques are necessary to create group cohesion and directed aggression in young men and in the second section asks whether the official stated purpose for war runs counter to the experiences of those on the front lines. It is Kubrick's skills that bring in just enough humor, horror, violence, and absurdity to keep the film constantly entertaining. Under war conditions, it is the front line troops with their dark humor that point to the absurdity of their goals and situation. The film rings especially true in this time where we are engaged in war in Afghanistan and Iraq with vague ideological goals of establishing democracy whereas the people of Afghanistan and Iraq, like the people of South Vietnam, may not view the conflict through the same eyes as Americans. The film is beautifully filmed. Kubrick was the finest film maker for interior scenes and the barracks on Parris Island, with their red shiny floors, created a perfect stage for the drama to unfold between the drill sergeant and the new troops. The bombed out buildings for the final scenes were fascinating, a labyrinth of death and danger. The acting was absolutely superb with Private Lawrence giving one of the most frightening performances while the Drill Sergeant giving one of the most over-the-top performances on film. The film is totally entertaining.

My only complaint is that it doesn't download videos to your video gallory, you have to go back to the YouTube download app. But thats not enough to take away the 5 star rating!
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Where to start, where to start. Paranormal romance books are my guilty pleasure and I was so happy when I discovered Jamie McGuire's \\"Providence\\" and \\"Requiem\\" (which I LOVE LOVE LOVE) and then I was even happier to discover she had another book out, \\"Beautiful Disaster\\". This book was beyond great. It was phenomenal and I'd recommend it to everyone. I bought and read this book all in the same day and now I'm re-reading it. I didn't put it down until it was done because there was no way I could put it down! Jamie McGuire is such a great author, she wrote \\"Beautiful Disaster\\" well, beautifully. It wouldn't surprise me if someday soon Jamie McGuire rivaled Stephanie Meyer because honestly this book was better than \\"Twilight\\".    I could feel so many emotions and I had a great connection to all the characters and the plot. The love story in this book is one of the best love stories I've read in a while. You will be rooting for Abby and Travis to be together no matter what happens. They've got such passion and it's refreshing. This book has made me wish, like I'm sure it's made or will make all of you wish, that you had yourself a bad boy with a golden heart in love with you, a best friend who's your rock, and a freshman college experience like Abby's. But I don't want to give away too much. So buy this book and find out the whole story for yourself!

B004EPZ07K|3.0|It feels like forever since Green Lantern first went into production, doesn't it? With all the news about more money being injected into the project to round out the special effects to Ryan Reynolds possibly not being involved in the Deadpool film that may or may not ever see the light of day to sequels already being greenlit to the film's reputation of being downright terrible, Green Lantern has had a ton of ups and downs along the way and its release is finally upon us. While there are certainly better superhero films released in the past few years in comparison and there is some truth to reports of the film being plagued with huge flaws, it still doesn't take away from Green Lantern being at least somewhat entertaining.<br /><br />As you can imagine, we follow Hal Jordan as he becomes a Green Lantern and the film is mostly the story of how he learns to deal with the ring, where it comes from, his biggest threat(s) and enemies, etc. It's an origin story, which seems fine going into it. Once you're actually watching the movie though, it feels like the origin story is forced. It's not that an introduction isn't needed, but we seem to spend a little too much time with Hal's past than we do with this extraordinary world that's just been presented to him. The film shines brightest during the scenes in outer space and you'll be craving more of the cosmos once the film is over. I personally wanted more Tomar-Re and Kiliwog. The special effects are at their best when Hal is in space en route to Oa or when Parallax is sucking the fear right from the bones of some poor organism. Planet Oa itself looks amazing and Parallax always comes off as both devastating and engrossing. Green Lantern almost felt like it was hog-tied into taking the origin path while its restraints were tightened every time the film tried to venture off into more adventurous territory.<br /><br />The cast came off as mostly likeable, as well. Ryan Reynolds portrays Hal Jordan to the best of his abilities as his belief in the project really shines through in his performance. Mark Strong looks and sounds like Sinestro, but isn't really given the chance to do anything important. Blake Lively's role was kind of weird. It's like she started off being more than the clich&eacute; love interest and then quickly evolved into nothing more than just that. Peter Sarsgaard is something else though. His over the top performance as Hector Hammond steals every scene he's a part of and that man can SHRIEK! His performance is laughable, but in the best and most memorable of ways.<br /><br />The special effects are just as much a blessing as they are a curse though. As mentioned before, they can get pretty mesmerizing at times. But when the action gets intense and the screen is filled with nothing but hyperactive computer generated effects, that cartoonish feel rears its ugly head. The scenes of Hal in the Green orb when Abin Sur first tells the ring to find a replacement and right before he goes to Planet Oa for the first time are pretty horrible. Once he starts flying it's fine, but him bouncing around kind of kills it. Sinestro came off as disappointing, too. They have the right actor for the role, but he wasn't utilized correctly. He felt similar to how Venom was just thrown into Spider-Man 3; he was just there to appeal to the fanboys. Then there's the post-credits scene that felt rushed. While awesome, it came off as too soon since the film gave no sign of what Sinestro eventually becomes other than this particular scene.<br /><br />Green Lantern is a terribly tainted superhero film. It seems to truck along at a wounded pace; almost as if Abin Sur's fatal wound and death would be a metaphor for how the film would play out. The storyline goes the simple origin route but it feels forced while dialogue was downright lame at times. However, despite its flaws, Green Lantern is still enjoyable. The cast is above satisfactory and seems to do what they can with the material and the special effects show that they are capable of reaching levels of greatness. Green Lantern isn't necessarily atrocious, but it's not good enough to be considered great either. It turns out that its imperfections are half of its charm and is still fairly enjoyable overall.e of reaching levels of greatness.

0811875040|5.0|I rarely pre-purchase a book before it comes out, but I have heard so much gushing about miette I was pretty sure I would like the book.  I received it two days ago and I just can't put it down!  The photography is gorgeous, and there are lots of photos in the book.  Every single one of them makes my mouth water & I love being able to see the beautiful shop even though I live on the opposite coast.  Another design element used in the book is scalloped edges, which is so fitting because Meg writes about how much she loves the packaging of pastries in France.  There was a lot of thought put into the design of the book.  And then there are the recipes.  I have few cookbooks that have made me want to try every single recipe but this one does! In miette, you don't just get a basic recipe; there are technique notes for everything so you will understand why you do what you do.  Meg discusses why you want your ingredients at a certain temperature, what the paddle does to your batter compared to what the whisk will do, how to make your chocolate ganache smooth and air-bubble free.  Many of the cakes are made with the same recipe- the hot milk cake recipe is the base for princess cake, lemon debutante cake, strawberry charlotte, and coconut mousse cake.  All of them are gorgeous and I can't wait to make them.  I baked the butter cake last night and my family loved the cake.  Beyond the baking, Meg explains how to decorate the cakes and really goes into detail.  Everything in this book has the same \\"je ne sais qoi\\" - simple yet beautiful.  The size of the cakes is nice too- most of her cakes are 6 inch cakes- just big enough that my family can have the cake without having to eat the same cake for days- which means I can try out all of the recipes quicker.  The chapters in the book are: cakes, afternoon cakes (think pound cake), cookies, bars, and pastries, candies and creams, miette essentials (basics like buttercreams and mousse), essential ingredients and essential tools, and sources.  I highly recommend this book; I know I will become a better baker because of it!
0553805371|5.0|Fascinating argument. They take the non-physicist gently through the entire thought process step by step. While the conclusion may be disturbing for some, it a side of the coin which should be considered. The book will leave you wondering whether they are truly on to something or are they just pounding square pegs into round holes? Bottom line: loved it.

Meg's shop is so charming and this book does not disappoint! My favorite items are the chocolate sables! I've been wondering how to make these for the longest time and now the recipe is included in this cute book! It's pretty, feminine, and just darn cute! I can't wait to make everything in this book! This is a definite must have in everyone's baking library!

B004S5D3B6|5.0|There are those who chalk up this whole film as a bunch of 'low-lifes' fighting each other, as something 'low rent'.  Well that's how I felt about the film 'The Wrestler' but not this one.  This is a redemption story and everyone loves a redemption story. The fight scenes are exciting, the personal lives depicted are stripped of romance and imbedded in reality.  The performance by both Bale and Whalberg are spot on as one would expect from both actors.  I highly recommend it.

B004EPYZPS|4.0|You might remember adventure films of your youth, where Middle America kids discovered amazing wonders and defeated great evils that only they could see.  These were the days of E.T., Goonies, and The Monster Squad, where kids laughed, cried, and fought while having adventures.  It's pretty much how adults remember their childhood summers, free of the soul-crushing realities of school, puberty, and adults. If you look back on your misspent youth in the early 80s with nostalgia, then Super 8 is for you.<br /><br />J.J. Abrams has seen those movies, and with papa Spielberg's blessings, wants you to see them too.  Although this film is ostensibly about a child (Joel Courtney as Joe) coming to grips with the death of his mother, it is not for children.  There's swearing, drug use, and violence - pretty much what you would expect from a film set in the early 80s. In fact, despite the lens flares, the out of focus camera work, and the soaring musical score, Super 8 distinguishes itself from other coming-of-age-with-aliens flicks with its unrelenting violence. The alien in Super 8 is big, mean, and angry, and he expresses that anger by eating people.<br /><br />The alien is a stand in for the adult rage that seethes throughout the town of Lillian, Ohio.  It's destroying father and widower Jackson Lamb (Kyle Chandler) from the inside.  It haunts Louis Daniard (Ron Eldard), who was indirectly involved in the accident that killed Joe's mother.  And it is passed on to the children, manifesting with painful eloquence in Louis' daughter Alice (Elle Fanning, bred from a race of superactresses).  When Joe finally confronts the beast, boy and alien finally see each other for who they really are: innocents thrust into bad situations.  Will their tortured legacy define them o r will they rise above it?<br /><br />Heady stuff for a movie, and Abrams' deft movie-making elevates a straightforward plot that might otherwise be lost in the alien-invasion morass.  The film is beautifully shot and, for the most part, tightly scripted.  But once boy and alien face off, the movie loses a lot of its momentum.<br /><br />Lurking throughout the military vs. townies vs. alien conflict is a hope of redemption for both Louis and Jackson.  This redemption is found in a car ride rescue by the parents, who of course don't rescue the kids at all.  Basically, the two guys could have had a beer and come to the same conclusions, but for pacing purposes it happens in a car.<br /><br />And that's where Super 8 isn't quite as successful. The ending struggles to mash the alien's resolution with a father and son reunited, complete with a symbolic locket of motherly love. It feels a bit forced, which detracts from an otherwise pitch perfect tale about filmmaking, death, and meeting girls.<br /><br />With less warmth than E.T. but a better script than Signs, Super 8 is a nostalgia-fueled trip for fans of horror and sci-fi who remember using words like \\"mint.\\" Everyone else might be a little bored.<br /><br />Except for zombie fans.

B003Y5H54W|2.0|It seems the current obsession with vampires and werewolves is so omnipresent that it even invades fairy tales. The original children's story is described as this: 'The earliest known printed version was known as Le Petit Chaperon Rouge and had its origins in 17th century French folklore. It was included in the collection Tales and Stories of the Past with Morals. Tales of Mother Goose (Histoires et contes du temps pass&eacute;, avec des moralit&eacute;s. Contes de ma m&egrave;re l'Oye), in 1697, by Charles Perrault. As the title implies, this version is both more sinister and more overtly moralized than the later ones. The redness of the hood, which has been given symbolic significance in many interpretations of the tale, was a detail introduced by Perrault. The story had as its subject an \\"attractive, well-bred young lady\\", a village girl of the country being deceived into giving a wolf she encountered the information he needed to find her grandmother's house successfully and eat the old woman while at the same time avoiding being noticed by woodcutters working in the nearby forest. Then he proceeded to lay a trap for the Red Riding Hood. The latter ends up being asked to climb into the bed before being eaten by the wolf, where the story ends. The wolf emerges the victor of the encounter and there is no happy ending.'<br /><br />Now take that old tale and replace the wolf with a werewolf (this is not the first time in world literature that this has been done!) and presto, RED RIDING HOOD appears as Valerie (Amanda Seyfried) who since childhood has been in love with the poor woodcutter Peter (Shiloh Fernandez) but Valerie's parents (Virginia Madsen and Billly Burke) have other plans: marry Valerie to the wealthy (but oh so good hearted) Henry (Max Irons),a factor that sets up a love triangle for the film.  Valerie's sister is found dead, the victim of a werewolf who has the reputation for killing all members of the family once he has a victim.  The village is terrified and arms against the werewolf.  Valerie seeks solace from her grandmother (Julie Christie) and with Peter.  A charlatan arrives in the village - Father Solomon (Gary Oldman) - to choreograph the end of the werewolf: he is assisted by a little crew of soldiers and by the local priest Father Auguste (Lukas Haas).  The werewolf strikes again and from there on out it is a wild chase to discover the daylight identity of the werewolf who only takes on the form of the beastie when the moon is full and red. To say more would be labeled spoilers and the story is so simple minded that no further help is needed.<br /><br />The story was written in this format by David Johnson and directed by the queen of vampire and werewolves Catherine Hardwicke (the Twilight series). The producer of this film is Leonardo DiCaprio which may explain why so many good actors were drawn to this insipid little disaster of a film. By now even the appetites of the teen audience for these stories is pretty saturated and this film did not succeed in drawing a big audience.  The cast does the best with what they are given (Max Irons gives evidence of a true find but the talents of Christie, Oldman, Burke, and Madsen are frittered away.

B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|I have to admit, I thought this show was going to be a disaster when I heard about it last year.  I never watched the original show but I knew how iconic it was and I felt that it shouldn't be messed with.  I stumbled across the last few minutes of the pilot episode and thought what little I saw was well done, so the next week I gave it a chance, and from then on I was hooked.  I love the different ways in which they respect and pay tribute to the original show, still keeping \\"Book Em Danno\\" in many episodes and even giving Jack Lord's car from the old show a role of its own in the new show.  The character chemistry is wonderful, especially between Steve and Danny.  In fact, their friendship and bantering is the highlight of the show in my opinion.  I also like the fact that even though it shows violence at times, it isn't as gory as some of the other dramas out there, so I can actually watch it and not turn my head because something gross comes on my screen.  I'm already excited for season two and hope they stay with the great formula they had for season one.
B003Y5H51K|3.0|SANCTUM (defined as a holy site and a place where one is free from intrusion) is touted to be a film by James Cameron of Titanic and Avatar fame: he is only a producer.  This 3D film would likely be more interesting in a theater where the 3D aspects of the photography by Jules O'Laughlin would enhance the beauty of the film.  But given those aspects of this little movie SANCTUM is a visual delight, a harrowing experience of witnessing nature at her most angry, and a bit of a sentimental slight story about father and son relationships and the interaction of humans when pitted against the hostile vagaries of Nature. Of note this film was written by Australian underwater explorer and photographer Andrew Wight (with assistance from John Garvin and may be based on some true adventures.<br /><br />Frank McClure (Richard Roxburgh is a grumpy, hard cave explorer and diver exploring the Esa-ala Caves off New Guinea with his trusty support team (Dan Wyllie, Christopher Baker, Nicole Downs, and Cramer Cain) when he is joined by the wealthy but shallow thrill seeker Carl (Ioan Gruffudd), his climber girlfriend Victoria (Alice Parkinson) and Frank's seventeen year old son Josh (Rhys Wakefield, a remarkably impressive handsome young actor from Queensland, Australia): Frank and Josh have never been close nor understood each other.  The mission is to explore the cave's connection to the sea and all goes well until the descent begins.  A storm begins and becomes a cyclone, filling the cave with rushing water in which members of the exploration team are lost. As the numbers of the groups taper down we're left with a father/son confrontation before the explorer party dwindles down to one.<br /><br />Director Alister Grierson in tandem with his special effects people make the most out of this rather superficial and flimsy script.  The cast is Australian and Welsh for the most part and the film was shot primarily in Australia.

B0052VUNHC|5.0|Loved this book so much as soon as I finished reading it I started over and read it again :D which is RARE for me!!!
0307387178|4.0|I found the book very informative and well written.The movie needed some serious editing.I dont know what it was,some of the scenes seemed to give it a low budget vibe.  After reading so many sarcastic remarks and put downs[about Chris]e.g. the  2 local 'expert hunters' of all people who stated it would take a real idiot to mistake a moose and proceeded to MISTAKE A MOOSE themselves!He DIDN\\"T they DID.I read the story about this obviously highly intelligent and adventure seeking young man  and I couldn't help but ask myself, Where would  WE be if people like Chris MCcandless didnt exist ? For one thing the \\"wild west\\" would still exist now like it was in the day.Believe it or not most chose to stay home.Why is obvious, it's human nature to rationalize with EXCUSES when FEAR rears it ugly head.I have nothing but respect for him and people like him.I don't recall reading anywhere he claimed to be perfect and knew all the answers.I bet the critics could come up with plenty of EXCUSES why they have never hit the road [and never will].\\"Well you know my job,cant just walk away\\" \\"If I had the money\\" bla bla bla  Yet they are quick to condemn him. I see it like this AT LEAST HE HAD THE BALLS TO GO FOR WHAT HE WANTED!He didn't talk, he lived his life to the fullest. All these monday morning quarterbacks sit around and talk and talk and talk and talk and......that's all that happens.TALK !That is the difference.Some people talk some people DO.The talkers love to crucify the doers for their mistakes.I remember he once asked a friend \\"How can so many people be so fu****g mean to each other so fu****g often ? How many people honestly think that way? He was exceptionally loyal and kind to the people he became friends with. A true friend. Something very rare.THAT is what made him a person you [in your lifetime] will probably never meet.You just think you do.
B0034G4ORM|1.0|This movie was done by a high school student who saw a whole bunch of old vietnam movies and tried to incorporate the feelings into a rip off of Independence Day.  The effects and the into is pretty much the same and the whole premise parallels Independence day.  The character developments are very sappy and poorly done.  there is no feeling and the special effects make me feel like I'm watching a cartoon....
B001NLKWLW|5.0|I choose books to read from the best seller lists and this was among them and boy am I glad I chose this one!!!!! Totally awesome read!!!! I feel I am very picky about the books I read and this book was truly up to par, truly engrossing, and one I will treasure for a lifetime!!
B001Q94TQA|5.0|Blu-ray picture is clear and beautiful, much better than the theatre print I saw in 2007.  Despite the improvement, film has not lost any of its naturalness; like we are evesdropping on real people.  John Carney's decision to ask his musical talent, unproven as actors, to be the movie; that was a great call.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I had really high hopes for this workout and it did not disappoint! I've done level 1 for two days now and I'm so pumped to keep going! As someone just starting to work out this DVD is really helpful. Jillian pushes you just hard enough to make you want to keep going but she doesn't overwhelm you with you very complicated moves.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|I finished the game and it was way too easy.  Not nearly as much fun as the first two Angry Birds games.  You can tell the corporate partners wanted something that would sell well and wouldn't offend anyone.  So they glossed up the background art, added a foreground, made the levels super easy so no one would get frustrated (the structures fall down much easier, you barely have to aim), and removed anything vaguely violent (no black eyes, nothing is \\"killed\\", enemies just get bumped off the screen.)    If you're a parent looking for a non-violent arcade game for a child it's a winner.  If you're an adult who's never played the first two games, it's probably worth 99 cents, but then I'd definitely try the first two.
B000XR4OC0|2.0|My daughter loved these shoes, she said they were super comfortable and to be honest they looked it! I was ready to by a bunch more but so glad I waited.  These shoes did not hold up or wear well at ALL.<br />My daughter ONLY wore a handful of times and they started to wear in the front. Now I realize we are talking about a kid but she is not a rough and tough kinda kid, more of a girly girl and does NOT beat up on her shoes...IF I felt they served their time and took a beating I would not be one to complain.<br />Just disappointed in the quality esp for price paid.
B004J4WN0I|5.0|It's about a 2100 year old druid's modern-day misadventures. These books are fast-paced, have great characters and interactions, and most of all are just plain funny. Aided by his very funny Irish wolfhound, werewolf buddies, and a vampire lawyer, he is plagued by stoners, witches, and the attentions of the old \\"gods\\" of several mythologies, mostly his own Celtic ones in this first novel. Ancient man's tendency to personify his deities makes for some great characters, from the Native American prankster God Coyote to the manipulative, capricious and vengeful pantheons of Greece, Scandinavia, or the druid's own Celts. Can't wait for the third book.
B00544L9EI|5.0|This was a solid album. No Super-duper amazing must thump songs. But there also wasnt any \\"oh no way this song sucks\\" songs either. So, solid album
B000SGGUWS|4.0|This book was amazing, but as with every great story, it has some flaws in my opinion.  I thought that the author could have stuck with one characters point of view throughout the whole story, like Aria for instance.  When she wrote from Aria`s POV it was better than any of the others.  But over all this book was a pretty amazing book
B004EPZ07K|2.0|Let me say I've never read the Green Lantern comic when I did read and collect them. I was never really interested in DC comics. The just didn't have compelling characters outside of Batman and I only started reading Batman after I saw the movie back in 1989. Right now I can't name any of the major hero's from DC outside of Batman, Superman, and Wonderwoman. I can name Flash also but that's only because of the TV series that came out back and 1990 which was a good show. I think that's the problem with DC comics as a whole their hero's aren't as well known or recognized outside of the big two Batman/Superman while Marvel has many likable and recognizable characters like Captain America, Spiderman, Wolverine, Daredevil, to name a few and even a lesser know character like the Punisher is probably better known than the majority of the hero's/Villains in DC comics. So I don't think there will be many who truly enjoy this movie outside of the ones who read the comic.    Now I don't want you to think this is the worst comic book movie out there but it is the worst of the this summer by far. But there have been worst. The Fantastic Four movie that was never released. I have a friend who has a VHS copy of the movie and the movie is the worst comic book movie I've seen. Jonah Hex, Catwoman, Ghost Rider, Punisher: War Zone to name a few of the terrible ones. No I'd but Green Lantern on the level of the first newer Fantastic Four movie which was bad but not horrible.    Now that I put you in a downer about Green Lantern I'll go on about what I did like.    I like that DC and Warner Brothers took a chance with this character. Since reading into the back history of the character he has to travel to other planets and fight in space. So this is the first comic book movie I can think of that takes place much of the film in space. It's a risk I don't think many movie studio's or Marvel will risk right now. So I need to give DC and WB credit for taking a chance on some levels it worked well. For example in taking us to a alien world and introducing us to alien Green Lanterns. I'll get to what I didn't like about this later on in my review.    Next I liked Ryan Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively. Ryan Reynolds(Hal Jordan) is a good but not great actor who has done mostly comedies. He does bring life to Hal Jordan but the writing and script didn't help him much. After seeing this movie I'd have preferred if he had done DEADPOOL. I think he was born to do that character but I don't know if it's going to happen. I hope after this movie bombs which I'm pretty sure it will studio's will still give him a chance to star. Then there's Blake Lively(Carol Ferris) who plays Hal's love interest. Again she is hampered by the bad script but she still brings her beauty and charisma along with her acting talent to this film to brighten it up. She's one of the few bright spots in the show Gossip Girl and was outstanding in THE TOWN. Sadly these are the only two characters who are the least bit interesting.    Finally there's the special effects which were good but not great. Going into this movie I thought from trailers this would be the worst part but I was wrong the effects were pretty good. The worlds I saw were believable and the alien characters looked alive.    Now onto the what I didn't like.    There is the story/writing of the movie. You won't understand anything if you haven't read the comic. Outside the Narration in the beginning you don't get anything. Not details on who the Lantern's are or who the immortal guardians are and this supposed great evil in Parallax. Then there is the high school script and dialogue is out of a a student film you'd expect a child to write. That's how bad it was some of the lines were laughable when they were clearly not intended to be. Finally there's the two useless bad guys which were uninteresting and weren't really that bad or at least didn't seem that bad. Loki and Sebastian Shaw in Thor and X-Men: First Class seem morealive and evil than the two bad guys in this film combined.    Now we go to all the useless actors in the film. Tim Robbins(Senator Hammond) is a ghost in this film as you won't remember him once he's gone along with virtually all the other actors except for the two I mentioned above. That includes Angela Bassett(Dr. Amanda Waller), Jay O. Sanders(Carl Ferris), Geoffrey Rush(Voice of Tomar-Re), and Michael Clarke Duncan(Voice of Kilowog) to name a few. Then there is Peter Sarsgaard(Hector Hammond) who I guess was supposed to be tortured soul/villain but he was uninteresting and unlikable and wasn't much of a villain. Finally there is Mark Strong(Sinestro). Mark is a good actor and makes a good villain. Sadly he was underused in this film and I wish he had been the bad guy and I hoped he would have been when the guardians gave him a yellow ring. Unfortunately it wasn't to be and we were stuck with Hammond and Parallax.    You'd think the action and special effects would coincide with each other but the don't with this film. While the special effects were pretty good the action was terrible and downright boring. I heard this movie cost around 175 million to make and you'd think with that much of a budget they'd have better action. I can't think of one good action scene in this film and the climax where Parallax invades earth and chases Hal Jordan around the solar system is terrible    The last thing I'll talk about is the score/soundtrack which there isn't one or at least I didn't notice one. I think this film would have been helped out by a good score/soundtrack.    I was hoping this movie would take place entire ally in space. I would love to have seen a superhero Star Wars type of film. I think it could have worked that way with a better bad guy and better writings. They studio had the budget for it and I'd like to know what they spent all that money on because the couldn't have used it all on this film judging by the finished project.    Overall a bad film but nota terrible one. I have no doubt this will be the worst superhero film of the summer and one of the worst I've seen but no the worst. So I'd skip it and if you need a superhero fix go see THOR, X-MEN: FIRST CLASS or wait for Captain America. This film isn't worth your time or the money you'll spend on it.
B004EPZ07K|3.0|Green Lantern hits theaters today, directed by Martin Campbell and starring Ryan Reynolds in the title role, along with Blake Lively (Carol Ferris), Peter Sarsgaard (Hector Hammond) and Mark Strong (Sinestro). It's written by Greg Berlanti, Michael Green, Marc Guggenheim and Michael Goldenberg and after seeing it I have one burning question: it really took four people to write this?<br /><br />You oughta know the plot by now: Hal Jordan, test pilot extraordinaire, gets chosen by dying legendary Green Lantern Abin Sur to replace him in the ranks.  As both the first human ever chosen and the bearer of Abin Sur's legacy, Hal has a lot to prove to his new comrades.  But the same galactic threat that killed his predecessor is still out there, giving Hal the opportunity to earn his stripes.<br /><br />The basic premise of the franchise remains intact, but only barely.  If you were unfamiliar with the comic you wouldn't know a whole lot more after seeing this.  What's presented here is disjointed, choppy and kind of dull, and I've never really understood the need for comic book movies to deviate so wildly from the established material.  The villain Parallax is a bastardized version of two DC characters, which is silly since if they used the one they borrowed from the most- Krona- you'd have practically the same story.  The origins and personalities of the Green Lantern Corps are the richest parts of the story- and one of the best in comics- and they all get shorted big time.  The Guardians of the Universe, elder beings and creators of the Lantern Corps, are just a bunch of big-headed blue sourpusses sitting around in the dark.  We're never shown what's so special about being a Lantern or why Abin Sur was so revered- Hal may as well have gotten the ring from a Cracker Jacks box for all the honor and responsibility he's supposed to shoulder.<br /><br />The opening sequence is a straight rip-off of last year's Clash of the Titans intro- with the whole half-hearted exposition delivered over space vistas highlighted by mock-ups of key figures and events.  Foreshadowing seems to be the order of the day in this film: at his brother's house Hal briefly plays with his nephew's Hot Wheels racing set, so guess what he creates in his debut appearance to stop a helicopter crash?  During Hal's indoctrination on Oa, Kilowog mentions out of nowhere something about the gravity pull of a sun, so in the big finale against Parallax... And somehow- I'm still not sure how- Sinestro convinces the Guardians to create a Yellow Ring based on the energy Parallax uses to combat him even though they mistrust and fear its power.  *sigh*<br /><br />Four guys, huh?<br /><br />Characters are just ok.  Hal is portrayed mostly as the boy who never quite grew up- which he was never portrayed as in the comics, so why now? Carol Ferris, his love interest, is actually more interesting than he is, but since she's not the main character...  Sinestro is given a little bit of rein to show why he's the Guardians' go-to guy, but doesn't have nearly enough screen time, not to mention how they seem to have completely screwed up his story arc.  I won't spoil it but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt- for now.  Likewise with Kilowog and Tomar-Re- two staples of the franchise that are relegated to bit players.  And the Hector Hammond storyline was completely useless; valuable screen time that could've been devoted elsewhere was wasted on this guy.<br /><br />Four- count 'em- four writers.<br /><br />It's not a total wreck, though.  The humor is pretty good and doesn't distract from anything, in fact it works fine- especially when lampshading the whole 'my mask hides my identity' bit, and when Hal's trying to figure out the Lantern's Oath.  The ring's FX are pretty stellar- the comic's versions are fully brought to life. The planet Oa is built upon the organic technology style that's in vogue these days, but just looks dank, dark and dirty.  Parallax is like a greasy, smoky escapee from some Lovecraft fanfic or someone's tentacle hentai fetish- sometimes it looks good, sometimes it don't.  And in typical Remote Control Productions style the music barely registers upon you, a down moment for someone of James Newton Howard's stature.<br /><br />But still- four of 'em?<br /><br />Green Lantern tries to be the type of origins movie that the first Superman film was but fails by not investing enough into the Lanterns themselves.  And you can't help but wonder why it took four guys to write it and still mess it up.cle hentai fetish- sometimes it looks good, sometimes it don't.

B000002TYX|5.0|It was awesome when they started this album with the new song Free as a Bird. It is a great song that really grabs you. the full alum is fun to listen to our favorite lads growing and evolving. if you get this you must get vols. 2 and 3 also just because. Highly recommend.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|This is a fantastic game that provides hours of fun! Although if you have a tablet, it's not worth getting the ad-free version because the ads are very small and do not get in the way of gameplay.
B000002LCU|5.0|This is one of my favorite Harrison albums! Great vocals and instrumentals. also it has a great crew of musicians working on it (Eric Clapton, Jeff Lynne, Elton John, Ringo starr and more). Harrison really out played many of his 70's work. this record is a gem and i highly recommend.
0425242099|5.0|What a great episode in the Psy-Changeling series! Fans of the series have been waiting for Hawke and Sienna's romance and I don't think anyone will be disappointed. The story was filled with romantic tension.<br /><br />Hawke and Sienna are both strong, sympathetic characters. Both have their problems too. Sienna has a very rare psy talent that has a habit of killing those who have it. And not only themselves. The talent can go out of control and have the effect of a nuclear bomb on the surrounding area. Of course, Sienna is afraid that she will lose control of it.<br /><br />Hawke is certain that he will never be able to have a mate because the young wolf who was destined to be his mate died when she was ten. He has a deep core of loneliness. He is also certain that Sienna is too young and too inexperienced for him.<br /><br />The larger plot concerns the upcoming war between the various psy councilors. One councilor is determined to wipe out both the wolves and the panthers and destroy the city of San Francisco because it is the home base of two other councilors. There are lots of attacks and small battles going on throughout the story.<br /><br />The book was exciting and the romance was hot. What more could a reader ask for? I recommend the whole series for lovers of paranormal romance.
B00006LSM3|4.0|This is a slightly strange album with a great title song. some of his vocals could be considered shaky, but this album has great instrumentals and well written songs.

B0051CSIKQ|4.0|Stakeland was a great Vampire/ Zombie movie. The vampires are definitely of the \\"30 DAYS of Night \\" brand, only more feral and animalistic. The vamps spread over the world and pockets of resistance exist that try to conduct human life as before, but there's another problem lurking about. There's a group of religious zealots who believe that the vampire outbreak is a sign from GOD to cleanse the earth and they use the vampires to do his(their) bidding. Stakeland is a coming of age film about a boy, his vampire killing trainer and a small revolving cast of people who could be his mom, brother and sister, and even girlfriend. Along the way he's faced with a stern un-feeling mentor names Mister who saves his life one fateful night and takes him as a pseudo-son and trains him for the harsh reality of living in a world filled with vampires. As I said, the film works great with good action sequences and down time scenes that don't drag on and help advance the story. My one problem is with the leader of the brotherhood and something that happens that nearly ruined the film for me. (SPOILER ALERT!!!It's a lot like what happened with Steve in Dawn of the Dead. The foreshadowing that if he was to turn, asking Sarah Polley to kill him. We all know what's going to happen right? But look how it happened: We have to overlook why once the zombie bit him, he must have killed it , although he didn't have any type of weapon, and he was given a fatal bite that killed him immediately. See if the zombie kille dhim, what happened to it? Did it run miles away after a killing blow cause he doesn't eat his victims he just kills them?  Why wasn't he ating Steve instead of Steve walking around reanimated? I hated that. Still do. Well we get soemthing akin tot hat here and it was so ridiculous that I almost stopped watching. I gave them a pass on that one small stupid plot device though, and overall I liked the movie anyway. OK. END SPOILER!!)    This is a good movie and if you liek your vampires as monsters, this is the film for you. You will enjoy it. Oh, and there's a scene 10 minutes in that I did not think I would ever see in an American film. Something so heinous that I had to rewatch it to make sure I saw it. You'll know what I'm talking about when you see it. Keep your eyes open for it. WOW.
B00000634J|4.0|This is a good record that tries to span much of johns carrier, but falls short. It would have been nice if they added a few more of his hard core tracks. The music on these are his more softer emotional songs. Great to try and catch your collection up, but falls short.

B000002UYZ|5.0|This album takes songs from many of the albums they recorded during this time so it covers the years well. fun for any beatles fan or any starter beatles fan.
B0012GMVG2|5.0|This was one of the greatest albums by one of the tightest and top bands ever to be assembled.  Many people forget that this album not only produced two of the biggest hits from the 1980's in \\"Rosanna\\" & \\"Africa\\" but won an incredible 6 Grammy Awards and sold over 3 million copies.  Toto has always been one of my favorite bands from that time period.  They were all much sought after studio musicians from Los Angeles who had played on just about every major group or artist's records up to the point they decided to form their own band in 1976.<br /><br />I first remember hearing of them from Quincy Jones who used David Paich & Steve & Jeff Pocaro on many of the albums he produced in the 1970's.  They also worked with another great producer from that time period, Maurice White of Earth, Wind and Fire.  Their 1st album blew me away with it's energy and musical offerings and I listened to them mature from one album to the next by the time they got to this, their 4th LP.  The album starts of with \\"Rosanna\\" a song that has such a nasty groove and shows off their musical talents with it's transitions and harmonies.<br /><br />The other major hit was the number 1 chart topper \\"Africa\\", this song cleary shows off the influence of Maurice White as it has a strong Earth, Wind and Fire groove and of course incorporates the mighty Kalimba an instrument Maurice made famous.  But this album is much more than these 2 songs, \\"I Won't Hold You Back\\" is a beautiful song and one of my personal favorites on the entire album.  \\"Make Believe\\" and \\"It's A Feeling\\" are 2 other great songs that should be paid close attention to by the listener.<br /><br />This is an overall great album and deserved all the praise and accolades it received back in 1982-1983.  The one problem is that it was released around the same time as the album which the very next year at the grammy awards won a record 8 grammy's and somewhat placed this and all other albums from that period on the back burner, \\"Thriller\\".
B004EPZ07K|3.0|2011 will probably be best remembered as the year when Marvel superheroes once again stormed the silver screen and further built upon their wildly successful fictional universe. In a way, it's easy to feel a little sad for DC, who, aside from Batman, hasn't had much luck with their own superheroes as of late. Thus, \\"Green Lantern\\" represents their own foray into the superhero film. But while a lot of time and effort was obviously put into the film, the finished product doesn't quite live up to it's full potential.    \\"Green Lantern\\" follows the story of Hal Jordon, test pilot extraordinaire, who excels at taking risks and doing the things no on else will. It's this daredevil attitude that leads him to a mysterious power ring that recruits him into the intergalactic peace keepers known as the Green Lantern Corps, who's members are said to be above fear. But while he has gained an extraordinary gift and an awesome responsibility, Hal must now deal not only with the threat of an intergalactic being who could destroy everything he holds dear, but also his own failings, which hold him back from being truly great.    When you really look at it, \\"Green Lantern\\" is a typical superhero origin film, with great visuals, some nifty action scenes, a healthy dose of humor, and a good message about learning to overcome fear. I also really liked the scenes on Oa, where Hal learns about the corps, and starts training to become one, which are easily the most entertaining parts of the film. But while all the elements for a great movie are present, \\"Green Lantern\\" feels like a puzzle where all the pieces don't quite fit together. Among these are secondary villain Hector Hammond, who has an interesting character arc, but is essentially a placeholder for the main bad guy, and ultimately feels unnecessary. There's also a light love story, but Hal's girlfriend ultimately contributes little to the story.  But what I felt to be the weakest element of the film lay in Hal working to overcome his own personal doubts, because he can't seem to make up his mind about what he's most afraid of (his father's death, or his insecurity about commitment). By the time the final battle began, I wasn't emotionally interested because it didn't feel like Hal had overcome a crippling personal problem. He just felt like a guy in a green costume with magical powers.    Overall, \\"Green Lantern\\" is strong in terms of visuals and humor (Hal's first attempt at reciting the famous oath is quite amusing, as are the jokes about his facemask), and the world of the Green Lanterns themselves is fascinating, but with the emotional backbone of the movie compromised, everything else feels fragmented. There are parts that definitely work, but had the emotional core had been smoothed out and clarified a bit more, \\"Green Lantern\\" could have been a lot better then it is.
B0034G4ORC|5.0|People reviewing this movie compare it with Independence Day, Blackhawk Down, etc. They say it's a cliche and nothing is new. Well I got news for you: we've been through more than 10,000 years of human history, nothing is new, everything is a cliche. I saw Independence Day, Blackhawk Down, and other notable war movies, but I enjoyed this movie just as much, here is why.<br /><br />Being in the Army ROTC, I have a taste of what military brotherhood is like. Although ROTC is nothing, I mean NOTHING, like the real Army, the sense of brotherhood is still there. I also know the very (i mean really very) basics of squad and platoon tactics, and far as I know, the film makers of Battle LA nailed it when it comes to the portrayed realism of these \\"Marines\\"; I had no trouble actually believing they were real marines.<br /><br />Versus Independence Day, Battle LA felt more real. The sense realism came from the portrayal of the Marines as a team; the emotional journey every combat unit goes through during battles and missions. Yes, the movie is based on an alien invasion, but Battle LA focuses on the dynamic of the Marines and their strong bond of brotherhood; this movie shows the loyalty and sacrifices of a Marine to protect his fellow Marine, which is perfect portrayal of the real world. (I especially liked the portrayal of relationship between a senior NCO and a fresh 2nd lieutenant). My hat goes off to the film makers for the authenticity.<br /><br />If you like war movies, with lots of battles and explosions, you'll enjoy every minute of Battle LA.

B0041KKYEM|1.0|What might have been a great film was ruined for me by an unfortunate turn into Gothic fantasy.  I guess that was the intent, but then what is the film about?  It's not about art or dance, or sexual awaking; it's about the onset of aberrant insanity so extreme in it's consequences that it approaches a Betty Davis horror film.  Not something I'd like to sit through twice.

0451219597|4.0|I have sometimes found Ken Follett too verbose but this book was an excellent fast read with a great female lead character. Flick Clairet is one of a select group of women helping the French Resistance during the final years of the Second World War. She is married to a French man, the leader of the resistance in Reims and in the opening sequence we see a group of them fail to overcome a telephone exchange that is crucial to the Germans. ''Several of the local resistance members are captured, tortured and a German intelligence officer is able to start unravelling the underground team there. He is a ruthless torturer although we also see his cultured side and his love for a Jewish mistress. He even gets terrible migraines when he has to torture people so Follett manages to create a villain who is still believable and not a caricature of the evil Nazi.<br /><br />After the failure of the team, Flick is determined to get back to the exchange and blow it up, creating a critical gap in communications at the same time as the Allied forces invade. The timing is crucial and the book is basically her mission back to Reims in order to accomplish this task. The only way in is to recruit other women to act as an all-female team disguised as cleaners. In that way they can get into the exchange and blow up the communications. The women Flick recruits have been rejected by other services and are generally unsuitable, a ragtag bunch including a convicted murderer, a Cockney explosives expert thief, a lesbian aristocrat and a transvestite whose lover had been killed by the Germans. The journey the women take, the danger they get into is the crux of the story. No spoilers but as in real life, they don't all make it.<br /><br />Flick is characterized as a hard soldier in that she is able to shoot a traitor and and fight in hand to hand combat, but she also has a softer side and is able to love and think about marriage. I like these types of characters and she made the story believable. She and Dieter, the Nazi interrogator are by far the strongest characters in the book and it really was a battle between these two throughout the book.<br /><br />Although you know that of course the Allies will win in the end, you still don't know until the last pages whether the team will survive. I enjoyed the book, reading it on a windy, wild Auckland day in pretty much one sitting. It's a thriller with an intelligent female heroine.

B003Y8YXH6|5.0|I lost my original copy of Double Fantasy to a flooded basement. So when I saw this remix along with the original track I knew it was something I had to get. I enjoyed listening to both versions and comparing them. Each version has its charm. I liked the stripped down version because I enjoyed the strength of clarity of John Lennon's voice. The original version brings back so many memories!<br /><br />Even though I like John Lennon's songs better, I am grateful to Yoko for several reasons. If not for her we would never hear either the original album (he would not have made it) or this album (would not have been released). To hear his muse helps me feel JL music better.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this album!<br /><br />Ali Julia review
B0051BVQFG|4.0|Nothing pisses me off more than watching a movie depicting Marine Staff NCO's with bad haircuts calling senior staff by their first name while in uniform.  Obviously the director had no clue about the etiquette of the Marine ranks.  I know this is just a movie, but if you are going to depict Marines, do it right.  Don't make them look like Army; it just ain't right.  And yes I know my stuff, I was a Staff Sergeant in the USMC myself.  Never once did I call a Master Gunnery Sergeant by his first name, I don't care how long I served with him.
B004EPZ07K|3.0|Saw the movie today. It was a OK movie. I will rate it as Good minus.    If you are a fan of comic, you get to go to support it whether it is good or bad.    I am a fan therefore I got to go!    As for regular movie goers, I think Thor and X-men First Class are better made.    The story is very simple. The CGI is OK, but nothing memorable.
1594202710|5.0|Dr. Kissinger is in fact an intellectual and as such it would be a good idea to keep an American dictionary close by as you read this important book.  I found the book to be a real page turner.  Have learned many things about the intrigue and deceipt among world leaders as well as thier human and funny side.  I think this book should be required reading for all high school students of all the countries mentioned in the book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Suzanne Collins does an excellent job with the introduction to this series.  I waited to read this book because I like to read series books all at once.  This book takes about one chapter to get hooked and then Ms. Collins takes the reader on a roller coaster ride, allowing the reader to experience the gamut of emotions that the human contestants in the inhuman Hunger Games are seemingly experiencing.  This is expertly written for fans of any age, which is what makes it so special.  Harry Potter, Pendragon and the Hunger Games are a fantastic trio of series that can be read and reread by any age over and over again.  Buy this book for anyone that loves adventure and human drama with raw, emotional, passionate, gut-wrenching, high octane style.
B00003CXCT|4.0|The set just arrived I eagerly opened it as its been sometime since Ive seen these movies and that was back in VHS form. The qaulity of the individual disks and cases seems great. I ordered Used but like new condition and it was as expected. I cant wait to pop these in and watch them on my big TV what could be better? Anyways my only complaint is the outside box that holds the movies is a little bit bent not bad though but like I said I ordered used but oh well. The disks seem very clean and the original papers and materials are in the cases so its basically new.
B004V6MWFU|5.0|Not sure why people are bashing this release. It's everything it promises to be. It's not a rock album per say. You have to be in the mood to listen to this album because it is very mellow. But, it's a very solid album and it's everything it promises to be. Ukulele songs.
B00076RT24|5.0|Just got this today have yet to watch it but its in great shape. I bought my copy used and was shoked at how good of condition it was in. I paid like $3 for it and its wonderfull. Lots of bonus content as well. I remember when this came out I cant wait to relive those theatre moments with this movie.
B003EV6DBM|5.0|my favorite season of doctor who so far, steven moffat did a brilliant job. Matt Smith is amazing as the new doctor, karen gillan is by far the best companion. overall this is an incredible season with puts doctor who on top of the sci-fi-tv-shows today for me.
B004EPYZPS|2.0|Because I'm the same age as the director, I can say that this film was marketed directly for me and folks in my generation.  I appreciated the nostalgia, but: my gosh this film is SLOW to develop, way slower than the films to which it plays homage.  This will bore 14 year olds to death.  This 38 year old feel asleep in one part.  It's a pretty film, and the child actors are VERY good, but the story is sort-of lame, and the ending pretty much a let down.  Folks are rating this film highly because they WANT to like it, but own it's own merits, it's really kind of boring and too slow paced to really capture the magic of, say, ET or the GOONIES.  Meh.
B004K4AUZW|5.0|I have been waiting a long SEVEN months for this album, since the 2010 VMA's......And let me tell you that \\"IT WAS WORTH THE WAIT!\\"...Lady GaGa has impressed and inspired me with each and every song on this album......My favorite album (non-stp replaying)......Thumbs Up GaGa!!!!!
B002AWJEU8|5.0|I think Steve enjoys the 'shock factor' when it comes to his playing...he is so good, that I think his fantastic guitar playing is becoming second nature and now he wants to see what limits he can push and still sound great - this DVD did it - obtaining 2 great violinists to 'duel' back and forth with and some stunning harmonies. And Dave is actually getting better! His song was pretty good compared to that 'Party song he did from 'Live at the Astoria'.  This is a new look and feel from Vai, and you won't be disappointed - all the musicians are great and Steve should sing more, he has a good voice.....
B004SBQAN8|5.0|I love this movie and have watched it four times already!  It's suspenseful and yet a love story too!  It's a great movie..........I recommend it to anyone who enjoys Science Fiction!    I hope they make a sequel which would be pretty easy to do the way it ended!
B00000IZOR|4.0|This phone is so cute, (1) problem is the string is too short even for a much yourger child. I bought this for my, then 1 1/2 yr old, and yes she loves it. However, when she did use it and would pick up the receiver the entire phone would be pulled up too. The string is just to short, other than that its adorable.
B004SB60OC|5.0|I am so happy I found Christina Perri's CD!  I looked for it in stores but could not find it.  I found it at Amazon and ordered it.  I think every song is a HIT!  Kudos to Christina Perri!  I hope she keeps singing and making CD's.  I'll purchase every one she comes out with!
B004H8GLXQ|5.0|Loved this. It was one of those books that makes you so excited to go to bed, just to read it. I like those.  I guess I'll say if you like Jane Eyre, books about people who like books, the Victorian era, the haunted appeal of say, Flowers in the Attic, an interest in the disturbed mind, a good mystery that's not in your face, or a gothic fairytale with wonderful prose, any of these and this book might be relevant to your interests. Or if you just want to read a ripper yarn.  I read Kate Morton's 'The Forgotten Garden', a similar themed book not long after this and would say if you liked that, you'll love this.  Two thumbs up!
B002N5N5LG|5.0|Now that the Season 2 DVD is being loaded with commentary, it's a good time to buy the Season 1 DVD in anticipation of watching Season 2's. This show is definitely a breath of fresh air on TV and only contributes to the greatness that is NBC's Thursday night line-ups (30 Rock, Parks & Rec, The Office has climbed back from its melancholy).    This show continues to be \\"original\\" (or at least in my viewing experience its original) and funny. Its got some of the lesser known actors in Hollywood that are primed to make a splash in the next few years after getting noticed on this show. The characters are likeable and somewhat realistic with writers and actors that seem to go the extra mile in making you truly wish these were real people.    Please watch and support this show as this may be one of my favorite shows on TV and could be yours too if you get it a chance!
0312330871|5.0|I'm an incoming freshman, and And Then There Were None was on my assigned summer reading list this year. Considering this book was written in (I believe) 1939, I thought I was going to be suffering through a boring, outdated novel. For once I will admit I was dead wrong.<br /><br />Most people, whether they realize it or not, are familiar with the concept of this book. The most recent time it's been used was actually on a very funny episode of Family Guy. The concept is this: A large group of people from the same town are lured onto a remote island where a lone mansion sits. Someone among the guests is a killer, and the guests try to figure out who among them is the raving lunatic before it's too late. The idea is so simple, but so perfect for a suspenseful mystery.<br /><br />And Then There Were None was reprinted this year, so minor changes were made. Rather than than the \\"indian island\\" and \\"ten little indians\\" you'll hear other reviewers mentioning are now \\"soldier island\\" and \\"ten little soldier boys\\" - I'm assuming this is to avoid any implication of racism. However, the original plot still stands: 10 strangers are lured onto Soldier Island, off of the Devon (pronounced dev-ehn) coast. In every room of the house, a poster of a nursery rhyme hangs, about Ten Little Soldier Boys. After their first group meal, the housekeeper plays a recording as instructed by the man he claims is his boss- a mysterious (and yet to be seen) Mr. Owen.<br /><br />The recording accuses all the guests of indirect murders. Not long after, one of the guests chokes on his food- as per the first verse of the nursery rhyme, where \\"he choked his little self and then there were nine\\". It's not long until the guests realize they're being attacked in accordance to the rhyme and that the murderer is among them. But will they unmask the murderer before it's too late?<br /><br />The book keeps you reading until the very last page. And yes, that does include the two epilogues... Enjoy~
159448385X|5.0|I got this book as a present from my boyfriend. At first I was reluctant to read it, but I'm very glad I did. At first it starts off slow and I would read it here and there, but once it gets going a few chapters in (Chapter 5 or 6), I couldn't put it down. I finished it all in one night. It's a great mix of friendship, family, love, tragedy, history, and adventure. It does get very dark and depressing for awhile, you have to just keep reading, the ending is almost perfect and makes the whole story worth it! I highly recommend it, one of my new favorites! It's also a great conversational piece! Hope everyone enjoys it as much as I did.
B004KA9MQO|5.0|Jennifer Hudson, can now be counted among the artists who don't have to stress about the sophomore slump, she has came through with glowing colors. Her latest effort, proves that nothing about her is a fluke, she is the real deal.  From the start of the album until the fever pitch ending, she doesn't let up.  My favorite tracks on this album are:    Where You At  I Got This  I Remember Me  Don't Look Down  Feeling Good  Everybody Needs Love  Still Here  Why Is It So Hard    I am already anticipating the next project whatever it may be from the super-talented Miss Hudson.
B004G600A4|2.0|Boy I am a sucker. After hearing this was finally a Disney title that equals past efforts I was shocked to find I had to shut it off after 30mins. Four completely boring songs, generic CG animation and story, characters I just didnt care about. Princess and The Frog steam rolls this 20 times over. Apologists like to the pull nostalgia card but I can honestly say we have back stepped greatly since the days of traditional animation or how they dealt with story and songs.
B004H8GLXQ|3.0|I love Gothic ghost stories, I love stories about books and I love beautifully constructed prose, but I only liked The Thirteenth Tale.  Even though Diane Setterfield writes in a manner that evokes the Bronte sisters' [[ASIN:1456534831 Jane Eyre and Wuthering Heights]], I detected more than a little influence of V. C. Andrews' [[ASIN:1442403012 Flowers in the Attic/Petals on the Wind)]].  An alternative book to read is Carlos Ruiz Zaf&oacute;n's [[ASIN:0143034901 The Shadow of the Wind]], an elegantly written Gothic story about books and those who love them.  Or if vampires are your preferred creatures of the night, Elizabeth Kostova's [[ASIN:B004E3XIAI The Historian]] is a hauntingly good choice.

B001HN690O|4.0|When it comes to sequels, it's rare enough that one manages to measure up to the first film.  More often than not they end up being disappointing to one degree or another. Particularly when you're talking about animated films (the Shrek and Toy Story films being more the exception than the rule).  But Kung Fu Panda 2 is that rarity among sequels in that, in my opinion, it is actually an improvement on the first film in quite a number of ways, which I'll get to later.<br /><br />In this film, Po (the kung-fu panda of the title) and the Furious Five (Tigress, Mantis, Monkey, Viper & Crane) are called on to face a new threat:  the return of the exiled Prince Shen (a peacock), who has come back armed with a powerful new weapon and determined to take over the kingdom. Complicating matters though are the fact that Prince Shen apparently had something to do with how Po, a panda, came to be raised by a goose, Mister Ping, his loving if noodle-obsessed father. In order to find the 'inner peace' he needs to defeat Shen, Po must first find the secret of his past, a past that he only sees in flashes of haunting memory that Shen's appearance has awakened in him.<br /><br />Beyond the plot though, almost everything in Kung Fu Panda 2 is better than the first film, which was already pretty respectable to begin with. One thing is that KFP2 steeps itself even deeper in Chinese culture and it shows in both the sumptuously colored and detailed art of the backgrounds, in the traditions subtly brought out in the story, and even in the musical score wrought by John Powell and Hans Zimmer. And there is more depth, both philosophically and artistically, to the kung-fu; a particular key sequence by Master Shifu early on is a slow and beautiful thing to watch.<br /><br />The voice actors are all excellent, with all of the original actors reprising their roles:  Po (Jack Black), Shifu (Dustin Hoffman), Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Viper (Lucy Liu), Crane (David Cross) and of course Mister Ping (the inimitable veteran James Hong). New additions include a sooth-saying ram (beautifully done by Michelle Yeoh), and kung-fu masters Croc (Jean-Claude Vam Damme) and Ox (Dennis Haysbert). And a notable cameo for film buffs is the voice of the Musician Bunny (director Paul Mazursky).<br /><br />I have to give particular praise though to how well Prince Shen was done. At first thought, the idea of a villainous peacock sounds, well, ridiculous. But Prince Shen, as conceived and dazzlingly executed by the animators of KFP2, and as masterfully voiced by Gary Oldman, radiates arrogant menace and threat, in attitude and physically, in a fashion that is both artful and deadly. Director Jennifer Yuh said that \\"Shen proved to be a great challenge to animate, so much that the complexity of the character was like that of doing six characters all at once.\\" IMHO, KFP2 is worth seeing just for Shen alone.<br /><br />And, for what it's worth, this is one of the few 3D movies I've seen that was actually worth seeing in 3D.<br /><br />My only quibble with the film is that it really didn't develop the Furious Five much as characters, which I would like to have seen. There are hints of things given about Tigress, but they're never really developed, and the rest of the Five are relegated to the same hero-support roles they had in the original.<br /><br />Highly recommended for anyone who likes a good story and especially for anyone who liked the first film. This one definitely takes it up a notch.rse Mister Ping (the inimitable veteran James Hong).

B001NEK2GE|5.0|I've owned a couple game boards.  The Wolf King Warrior seemed promising but it wasn't programmable.  The Razer Nostromo \\"previously the Belkin Razer Nostromo N52TE\\" was very uncomfortable and awkward.  It also felt kind of cheap.      This game board is the best of the best.  You can use it with either left or right hand, it has many programmable setups, it is very comfortable and surprisingly sturdy.  At first I wished they got rid of the LCD and dropped the price.  Now I love the LCD.  I can monitor Ping, CPU temps, memory use, GPU/CPU usage, and many other stats.  Being a 3D artist, this has been very useful outside of gaming.  I know when I'm about to run out of memory and it helps troubleshoot where your system is lacking.      This is the same price as the Razer Nostromo.  How that happened I have no clue because it is so vastly superior in almost every respect.  If you are looking for a game board, this is the one to get.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|as fun goes, this game has tons, and Rovio never stops offering updates to keep the fun alive. the only flaw was with the last update.  i originally got the game for free in the android market. when it amazon offered a paid version, i jumped on it. i totally believe in supporting devs. anyway, the lastest update 6/16/11 stole my ownership of my copy. so instead of being able to play the newest level on Angry Birds classic... i cant even open it. i am utterly pissed.
0345457692|1.0|\\"Altered Carbon\\" is the story of Takeshi Kovacs, whose mind has been downloaded to Earth and placed in a stranger's body so that he can fulfill the job of figuring out why an uber-rich, centuries old man who knew he couldn't die would kill one of his own bodies.  What promises from the reviews to be a complex and intriguing story turns out to be 500+ pages of superficial scenarios that are poorly stringed together.  I only bothered to finish the book because I assumed events would come together for a grand finale, but the ending was just as blasé as the rest.  The scenes, with their gratuitous weaponry and violence and cartoonish characters, generally read like a graphic novel (no offense to the good graphic novels out there) and the writing is so shallow that I just couldn't care.

B004K4AVAG|1.0|Only doing this review to get amazon not to recommend me this crap.    Everything from the cover to songs and videos are cheap simple easylistening pile of useless garbage that is made for average joe consumer who loves sugar coated melodies and brainless lyrics.    Cover colours and titles of songs may suggest association with metal or gothic genre. Don't be fooled. Cover is an atrocity btw.    Its a pity this sells... This proves that most people don't appreciate proper music. Not that I care.
B004WJREPO|4.0|Dearest Paul:    We, your adoring fans since we were kids are very happy for you in your new role as elder stateeman for rock and roll.  We really are, and we will never stop being in your corner, but this historical revisionism has got to stop.  In the otherwise revealing essays that accompany the Deluxe Edition of McCartney II, an album I love far beyond its actual merits (probably due to it being the first of your albums I ever owned) you say that the 3 photographs that grace the inner sleeve are you just \\"making fun with characters.  Like the posh Englishman: har har.\\"  So we are to believe that these 3 pictures in NO WAY represented your old bandmates?  One with you in granny glasses looking somewhat disapproving just happens to coincindentally resemble John?  Once again, I need to remind you that we are fans.  We know the history.  He did a really rather nasty song about you and took a picture with a pig that looked like one of your album covers.  We know that you weren't always best buds. and that is O.K.  It will not tarnsih your legacy one bit to admit that these pictures were a playful homage to your old band.  What will tarnish it is lying.      Luv,     Your Fans

B003Y74AZ2|4.0|This case is great. On the back there is a spiral pattern which gives it a great grip, and it also makes it look very nice too. It fits the AT&T iPhone and the Verizon iPhone which is very nice. My only gripe is that it offers very little protection from drops, but I only bought this for looks and protection from scratches. Overall, it is a good case, but I would not recommend it for drop protection.
0385733577|5.0|I have read to my son since he was less than 2 hours old.  It's always been my thing.  I'm a huge book lover and have been my entire life.  I can remember, and actually still have, the very first chapter book I ever read.  So imagine my surprise when my son, who is now 11, does not like to read.  He's a good reader, he comprehends what he's reading well, and has consistently gotten A's in reading...however he will very rarely pick up a book on his own and actually read it.  Over the years I've allowed him to read those gaming guides just to ensure that he was reading something...I checked them over and the words are hard and the books themselves require some extra research so I thought \\"why not\\".  I've read him the Harry Potter series, my personal favorite, and I've read him other fictional books to no avail.  No spark.  Until I picked up these books by Michael Scott about Nicholas Flamel...I have this big comfy over stuffed chair in my room and we put on only the reading light...get cozy and he eats them up.  They are a wonderful series for older boys who are gamers at heart - little character development (which is all Harry Potter is) and tons of action (the true action in Harry Potter always comes at the end of a book).  It has magic, humor, and tons of destruction - a boy's dream.  Try them sometime if your boy, like my boy, requires constant and never ending action in his books and games but doesn't want all the reflection and emotion of Harry Potter!  What I always loved the most about Harry Potter was how JK seemed to seamlessly mix true historical figures and mythological beasts into this fantasy world she's created.  She holds nothing to Scott.  His world is not only entirely made of these characters they are amazingly important to the book.  My son has begun taking names out of the book and researching them online - additional reading!  Just a great book for those kids that love magic, action, and fact!!  A wonderful blend.
B004V7XWEE|5.0|I read about this edition in The Rolling Stone and knew that it would be the perfect gift for my father. I was not miss taken. \\"Whats Going On?\\" was the best (not \\"one of the best\\") protest albums to come out in the 70's and should be listen by anyone alive today. The 2 CD's are the remastered version as well as tons of unreleased tracks and B-sides. But the selling point of this album the the 8\\" Vinyl. In all fairness, that alone is is worth the $50 asking price.<br /><br />Buy this if you have working ears, they will thank you.
B004EPZ07K|5.0|I went in the movie theater, with limited expectations, especially after the disappointment of the  Green Hornet which was fun and light but just was not satisfying.  Green Lantern had great special effects,  an actual plot, interesting aliens, great action scenes, and maybe was the best comic book movie to date, and this includes the   spiderman trilogy.  The 3D was done very well but was not as harsh as Tron, and it just eased its way throughout the movie.  I really enjoyed this movie and amazingly enough, was well worth the price of admission.  Bravo to Ryan Reynolds, who  played it mostly straight and for making the fleshing out his character better than almost any other comic book movies.   FIVE STARS
B000003CUJ|4.0|Reading some of the other reviews, this is a) the greatest thing since sliced bread or b) a poorly executed hack job. Well, I believe it is neither. My biggest disappointment is that someone decided to put this on one CD only - that is its biggest problem. Another reviewer mentioned glaring omissions and is absolutely right.  Had it been longer... but it isn't.    It is one CD only and, in that light, it is pretty good. If your only exposure to The Ring has been the countless movies that have used the \\"Ride of the Walküries\\" (included, of course) then you are in for a treat. Repeated listenings and learning about the missing great stuff may lead you to seek out recordings of the different operas or (dare I say it?) attend performances.    For those who carp about the sometimes abrupt transitions, how would you have done better? Please don't say that you would have written transition music. Wagners music starts at the beginning of the act and flows till the end. Sometimes, an abrupt ending is the only choice if you are going to excerpt a section. I speak as an arranger, composer, conductor, orchestra player and singer (I have performed Wotan/The Wanderer).    The reason that Siegfried is the shortest is that you hear a lot of its music in the other three, not because it is somehow musically weaker than the other three.     For the seasoned Wagnerite: You don't need this unless you want to give it as a gift to someone unfamiliar with the music - and then it is perfect.    It should have been 2 CDs.
B0001CNRB6|5.0|I saw this movie only once--when I was but ten and in the company of my parents.  Rock Hudson plays an advertising executive akin to our current Mad Men crew--but with a life that seems way more fun and devoid of angst.  He had promised his girlfriend a part in a high-visibility TV add campaign.  He is faced with the problem that there is no product on the horizon that merits such a campaign.  Not to be thwarted in his quest, Rock's character starts making the commercials starring his girlfriend--featuring the imaginary product \\"Vip\\".  Without specifying the nature of the product the actress in the commercial is seen to declare such things as \\"I got my man with Vip\\".  Doris Day plays a rival add exec who is vying for this imaginary account.  Of course Rock and Doris end up in their own romantic entanglement.  In one of the final scenes a pregnant Doris is whisked to the hospital delivery room on a gurney while a mobile ceremony is being performed to unite her in holy matrimony with the attendant Rock.
B004LE7PCM|5.0|Sherlock Holmes? What can one say about these stories that has not already been said? They provide a glimpse into London at the turn of the 19th century. The ingenuity of the plots, the clever criminals,  Holmes' reasoning, Dr. Watson's amazement: these are all fascinating to read and experience. Holmes is part of English literature and worthwhile reading for anyone. What is even more fascinating is that for some plots, no crime was involved. Yes, some stories involved interesting schemes without a murder or a theft. In one, Holmes even let a murderer go because he thought the crime was justified. Dr. Watson, never pictured in film as being a husband, marries one of the female characters in one of the stories. You've seen the more criminally sensational tales in film; but there is much more and their reading is even better. Even more interesting is that you will recognize many of Doyle's plots in contemporary cinema. This collection is a must have for anyone's reading list.

B0052UZIFA|3.0|I've played PVZ on other platforms and it was much better.  This version's graphics were lacking for one, every time you unlock a new plant the picture is fuzzy.  Also, I have an HTC Aria so space for apps is limited, and upon completing adventure mode a 15mb victory video is downloaded to your internal memory that cannot be removed..  Very annoying.  I loved this game on other platforms, but it has a lot of room for improvement on Android.
B002ZG99QS|1.0|I was fascinated by the original Tron when I was a kid. As an adult, I could look upon it with a more critical eye, and even though there are some plot holes & dated graphics (which I now consider stylized and still enjoyable to watch), overall I still find it to be a good movie, with good acting, and a story line that is engaging. In brief, the story is basically about good vs. evil, freedom from an overbearing overlord and the need to fight to keep your freedoms, with a little religion thrown in. Is it a deep mental exercise on these issues? No, it's more in the lines of a traditional fairy tale, replete with a happy ending. I prefer this style in my entertainment - life is ugly enough I don't feel the need to wallow in it when I'm trying to relax.   Tron Legacy seems to miss the entire point of the first movie, and as such isn't really a sequel. The plot (if it can be called such) couples teenage angst and the typical Hollywood hatred of capitalism (unless it's making them money) with some comic book-like super villain bent on conquering the world through invasion - from his digital realm because apparently having a physical fight with humans is much more effective than a digital fight. Go figure. It starts with a 27 or so year old man behaving like a spoiled & self-centered 14 year old child trying to get the attention of his daddy.Since his daddy has been missing for 20 years, one has to ask why bother (or even at what point he will grow up). He breaks into the highrise of what is ostensibly his own company in order to commit some domestic digital terrorism by releasing the brand new program, thereby destroying what is probably months of work from many people and making any profit from the product impossible. Being a spoiled 14 year old child, he never considers all the people who depend on that company for a job (the outside contractors, the lowly janitors), all the people who have retirement investments in that company, the company's ability to survive aftera hit like that, or even his own dependence on the money that he never earns. Aside from the \\"prank\\" aspect, he gives a speech as to how programs need to be \\"free\\", which I can only assume is an erroneous understanding of the freedom in the first movie.   Once we enter the digital world we are inside nothing more than a dark comics cityscape with lots and lots of neon lights. It's not imaginative or even attractive. The battles were nothing but kung-fu fighting. Even the few disk battles were mostly kung-fu & didn't really represent the idea of the disk battle. The light cycle battle, though exciting for a motorcycle race (if you could figure out who was who), missed the point of the first movie's light cycle battle. Jeff Bridges' character has now become a Zen master, who, much like his son, does absolutely nothing while living a posh life away from all the strife. His other persona, CLU, is a stiff-faced digital rendition of his bad self who possesses all the bad guy cliches you want. Tron is nowhere to be found until the very end, and he looks like a neon-garbed bad Spiderman (or whatever black suit Spiderman was). I could really go on and on, but I'm bored just thinking about this movie. It's almost as boring as Avatar. So if you liked that movie and thought it was the most thought-provoking thing you've seen in a long time, I highly suggest you watch Tron. If like me, you preferred to watch it with the sound off (the graphics really were amazing), you could skip Tron Legacy until they have re-runs on TV.

B004ULEEY8|5.0|If your hoping that his movie is better than Skyline, I am proud to say...YES! To be honest, I have been waiting for a movie like this to come! I love alien invasion flicks as much as the next guy, but this one is unique in its own way. If your thinking this might be just another Skyline, your in for a sweet surprise! Skyline was an absolute bore, but this film was just action pack! And I am not a guy who like movies just for action. Don't get me wrong, I love a good movie that makes you think like, The Thin Red Line, and Apocalypse Now where it had limited action sequences. And I am a huge fan of movies such as Dr. Strangelove where most of it is dialogue.      This movie is an alien invasion film done right. For far too long I have seen movies that only show the civilian point of views where you only see the military in action very few times like, Steven Spielberg's War of The Worlds. I have been wanting to see a huge full on battle with tanks, helicopters, fighter jets, and infantry duking it out against invaders. This movie has it and it also shows the situation around the world, as it doesn't seem like the United States is the only one being invaded. The movie gets right to the point and doesn't drag on of the intro like Skyline did. That is where Skyline lost me. The intro didn't feel like an invasion film, and (SPOILER) the time it took for the aliens to arrive took too long! And the military response time was ridiculous! THREE DAYS! In three days we probably would have lost already if the military took that long to respond to an invasion!     So if you want to see a war-movie with non-stop action and tons of soldiers, tanks, helicopters, fighter jets, and ALIENS! This is the movie for you! Yes some of the dialog was typical cliche Marine language. What do you want? Thin Red Line where everyone was a Plato with guns! Don't get me wrong I LOVE Thin Red Line for being so poetic and artful, and just beautiful! But every now and then, I want to see some explosions just for the heck of it, or if I am with a group of friends. Its not perfect at all. But its fun!
B0009HLD0K|5.0|This is a terrific movie about breaking barriers between the haves and the have-nots. It encourages people to stick true to their ambitions and never falter in the face of adversity. I highly recommend this movie!
B000WZAE1I|3.0|Saw previews of this and thought it would be good.  It looked like it fell in the category of movies I like.  It was just Ok, not worth buying, unless you can get it cheap.  I bought it at a good price, but would have rather just rented it.  I liked the main story line, but that was all.
B004ZGI2KK|1.0|I gotta say as werewolf stories go, this is the lamest attempt I've ever witnessed. This remote village in the middle of no where (looks like the Bavarian Alps) looks less like a medieval story land and more like a full page ad from a fashion magazine. Where did this small village get all its hair stylist and mousse!   Its the middle of the 'hardest winter' they've ever known, they're living in log huts on the edge of a dark forest where dwells a ravenous werewolf, there is no inside plumbing, the only hot water they have is boiled in small kettles over a wood fire, but some how the entire village is squeaky clean and neatly pressed.  This movie tried too hard to tie all the disparate mythologies from Brothers Grim into a neat little package and make them palatable for all the Stephenie Meyer fans and it failed terribly.   The acting (except for Gary Oldman) was terrible. The lighting was monotonous. The script writing was poor and the musical score was painfully annoying.  I would not recommend this movie to anyone looking for a seriously adult version of Little Red Riding Hood. I'd give it a negative number of stars but you can't do that on Amazon.
B000I2J6K0|1.0|This was the only pregnancy DVD that was available in my local record store so I picked it up. I'm in my fourth month and haven't been able to do much in my first trimester since I was on Bedrest. I was pretty disappointed with this DVD, the sound, image quality is not the best looks quite amateurish. I think they use her husbands celebrity status to sell this more than the benefit of the workout itself.   And to be honest I found her to be quite annoying when she keeps saying, 'Go go go' every second.....

1591843790|5.0|This book by Guy Kawasaki was as enchanting as the title implies.  The book is both personal and factual.  The underling philosophy reflects the maxim, High Tech and High Touch.  Guy seems to embody these characteristics when it comes to starting and evolving a business.  His advice to smile with one's eyes, as well as realistic tips regarding the savvy use of modern day technology are  thought provoking and amusing. Guy is successful as a businessman, innovater and inspirational speaker. Guy has a realistic view of what it is like to work in a place like Apple, especially at a time of transformation.  He was at Apple when the first Macintosh was developed and entered the Market Place.  His title at Apple was Chief Evangelist.  This book is a secular evangelical enterprise regarding business.  The personal advise is as thought provoking as are the advocacy of skills in Business. In fact, they are inseparable.  The inclusion of a personal stories by a different people, including one by Guy himself, were inspirational.  The book is well written, amusing and useful.  I am doing my best to be both enchanted and enchanting as a result of reading this book.
B001EHDQFO|5.0|but... Kindle users please take note:  Parts of the Kindle version are very difficult to read (italic bold small print on gray background in the hardback doesn't translate well to the Kindle screen), so I also purchased the hardback.    It's a quick read, and one you'll want to keep handy.  In short:  it gives you permission to:  remove the guilt (about not getting ENOUGH done), let's you be satisfied with getting a small part of a large thing done, and helps you see that allowing small steps really does lead to larger steps getting done with less thought, less stress, and with less failed planning.      It's well written, and I really like that the examples cover a broad spectrum:  from exercise to weight loss to illness.  It's conceptual, allowing you the freedom to personalize it to your own needs.    Enjoy!

B000244FDW|5.0|I first saw this version on Netflix, and didn't quite like it at first.  But after watching it a couple of times, because it had more dialogue between Darcy and Elizabeth, I became addicted to it.  I had to buy the DVD, which is of much better quality than Netflix's.  I must have watched it twenty times already!  I really like Colin Firth's version, but I must say I like this one a little better.  It is much better cast and this Elizabeth is more of what you picture her to be after reading the book.  I love every single scene Elizabeth and Darcy appear together.  David Rintoul is intriguing.  I have never watched a dvd so many times!
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|I was encouraged to watch the movie based on the extra clips on Focus's YouTube page; the depth of the language in the conversations between Jane & Mr. Rochester gave me hope that it will not betray Charlotte Bronte's book.  It is a true adaptation of the book by all means and I actually thought the 2 hours length did not do it justice.  I am praying the DVD version will have a director's cut version in it that includes all the scenes taken out to fit into the timescale for public viewing.  Michael is indeed the best Mr. Rochester ever, Timothy Dalton comes next.
B003LXT8YC|4.0|Bettye Lavette is not to everyone's taste. We are the same age and I love her and have for years. But even I can only take her in small measured doses. Her powerful emotional renderings sear to the bone. Preferring Motown and the Memphis sound, I ignored most of the British invasion so most of these covers are new to me. Each is done in her own style and sound as if they are from her songbook. That is the beauty of Betty Lavette. Whether she does covers or originals she makes each her own. I suspect that those who are familiar with the originals will be appalled. Others who are put off by her raw emotional delivery will be equally appalled. However those of us who know her work will be delighted.
159420229X|4.0|There is a lot of what you can do with memory, what has been done about memory, and how to prepare for memory contests - EXCEPT the actual techniques. The author ruminates sparingly on techniques, going more into old techniques in some historical texts that will never be available in your local library. Except for one memory palace, he shares nothing about his other personal learning techniques. He will go in greater details on what and how of the memory technique, and will skip over practical examples to learn from.<br /><br />BUT this still deserves 4 stars for - creating awareness on mnemonics. Joshua highlights perfectly the state of education and learning in the USA, and how the impetus has moved away from learning. He presents a solid case for learning methodologies that children must learn before they apply them to something that the child likes. Joshua earns great respect for making us realize, through medical and non-medical endeavors, the blessing of memory.
B004L3AQLU|3.0|A handsome guy (Jake Gyllenhaal), who can pick up any girl just by snapping his fingers, apparently meets and falls for a mediocre, tolerably attractive woman with an apparent caustic behavior problem.  If true love is mysterious, then I guess it can also be cruel.<br /><br />Usually, I don't think much of Anne Hathaway as a girl to pursue for love.  But, she actually did fit the part of a woman with a deep rooted problem (Parkinson's).  She's got a trashy look about her, so I would expect that a good looking guy like Jake Gyllenhaal could have easily pursued any other girl who would have had her act together more.  Anne Hathaway was trying to push him away.  So, I would have certainly taken her advice from the word \\"go\\", from the very first abrasive moment she threw at him.  Especially after getting a \\"head's up\\" from a man who married a woman with Parkinson's disease. The man even told him that, if he had to do it all over again, he certainly would have moved on and looked for a relationship with somebody else.  That would be all that I'd need to hear.<br /><br />Anyway, this movie is probably true to life about dealing with someone with Parkinson's Disease.  But, as a young man, I would have tried to avoid starting a relationship with someone who obviously has issues already so early in her life.

B001JAFYFG|3.0|The music in the movie is really outdated.  It tries to be futuristic but it just sounds so hooky.  But, what I really enjoy about having this movie is seeing both Jane Agutter and Farrah Fawcett-Majors in beautiful High Definition.<br /><br />I don't have to explain the story, I'm sure.  Because, if you're reading this you must have seen this movie long ago already, and you just want to know how well it looks in remastered High Definition.  Well yes, it looks really good, although there are some grainy scenes, but that's expected for any movie over 30 years old.  Wouldn't you think?<br /><br />Jane Agutter is the main reason why I bought \\"An American Werewolf in London.\\"  But anyway, this movie is well worth the less-than ten bucks that it sells for on Blu-Ray.  I originally paid 16 dollars.  I should have waited a little longer.  Oh well.

B004UXUSIM|5.0|. . . with Midnight in Paris. It probably helps that I just got back from Paris a few months ago, and that I'm a writer, so I related with every thought of Owen Wilson's character.<br /><br />I'm not normally a fan of Woody Allen's work, but this one defies his other films and becomes something that is wonderful and amazing simply for being. The ambiance of this film is reminiscent of Stranger Than Fiction, which, if you haven't seen that, is an absolute must. It has same mythical/magical yet realistic quality I adore. In literature, that type of story is often called Magical Realism, and for good reason. These films take ordinary people and add enough magic that they become extraordinary, even if just in their own lives.<br /><br />It may already be too late, since the Amazon review spoils much of the mystery, but if you can, AVOID ANY SPOILERS before watching. I knew what was coming and was excited for it, but I imagine had I not known and gone in with a clean slate, the experience may have been even more magical.<br /><br />Can't recommend this movie highly enough. I'm just waiting impatiently for it to be released on DVD so I can obsessively watch it whenever I need a bit of magic in my own life.

0307588335|5.0|I loved the way the author, Mr. McDonald, weaved together the story of his life - he didn't follow the traditional path to Wall Street - and the story of the fall of Lehman Brothers and the making of the financial crisis that, I think, changed the course of history.<br /><br />Mr. McDonald's view is not one-dimensional, in that he sees many causes for Lehaman's collapse. (Though I wonder if his dislike of Lehman's chairman is a bit over the top.)<br /><br />Also, though sometimes I had to reread some parts, I learned a lot about the world of finance, so this book is educating and well as entertaining.<br /><br />In the end, this is not just a story of Wall Street, but a story of one man's journey of overcoming obstacles only to find, unexpectedly, disillusionment and then a sort of redemption.<br /><br />To me, one of the themes of this book is: Be careful what you wish for. You may get it.

B0051BNRTO|4.0|I love reading books by Nick Hornby. He has a perfectly blending of music, relationships, and witty dialogue. I've read many of his books, including High Fidelity and About a Boy. Both books were great, and the movies were excellent adaptations. After quitting Hornby's young adult offering, Slam!, I decided to try again with Juliet, Naked.<br /><br />Juliet, Naked is the story of Duncan, an obsessive fan of the fictitious singer-songwriter Tucker Crowe whose 80s record \\"Juliet\\" is respected as one of the top break-up albums of its time. After this masterpiece, Tucker Crowe disappeared into obscurity, leaving rabid fans like Duncan to assess, analyze, and pontificate on the whereabouts of Tucker Crowe. When a striped-down version of \\"Juliet\\" arrives in the mail, Duncan reaches euphoria and posts how this version he dubs \\"Juliet, Naked\\" is the pinnacle of Crowe's genius. Other Crowe aficionados are impressed and envious at Duncan's review.<br /><br />One person who is not impressed is Annie, Duncan's girlfriend. She posts a critical review of \\"Juliet, Naked\\" with Duncan's condescending approval. Soon, Tucker Crowe himself contacts Annie to praise her review of this terrible record, and a relationship begins without Duncan's knowledge. He is too busy organizing his bootleg CDs and speculating how many Tucker Crowes can dance on the head of a pin.<br /><br />The novel examines the idea of celebrity and fandom; how do these two work together and how do they contradict each other? It discusses how Tucker Crowe is defined by those few middle-aged men with prodigious knowledge typing away on the Internet. Is it possible that Duncan knows more about Tucker Crowe than Tucker Crowe does? One of the most entertaining and poignant scenes is when Tucker and Duncan meet to discuss his music.<br /><br />Hornby creates a real musician with a powerful record that does not exist. I found myself wishing I could listen to \\"Juliet,\\" especially the closing track, \\"You and Your Perfect Life.\\"  I suppose we all have those \\"Juliet\\" albums in our lives, records that mean more to us than they mean to the artists who created the works. Perhaps there will be a small conclave of middle-age men analyzing Nick Hornby and the book Juliet, Naked twenty years from now, loving it more than Hornby himself does. What will Nick have to say to them then?se \\"Juliet\\" albums in our lives, records that mean more to us than they mean to the artists who created the works.

B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I read this book after my first marriage ended and before I remarried. It was a nice way to do some relationship \\"homework\\" before getting remarried. My fiance at the time (now husband) and I read it together and we each identified our love languages. I have to say, I think we not only learned about each other, but learned a little something about ourselves, too. It was an easy read, both enlightening and encouraging. The book did seem a little God/Christian-y at times, and while I am not a religious person, it did not bother me. The principles set forth in this book are sound whether you are a religious person or not. I feel that the information we took from this book has helped us build a strong foundation for our marriage.
1594202710|5.0|Recently, for the obvious reasons there have been many books published about China. Especially since China's meteoric rise has accelerated in the last dozen years.  Gargantuan economic growth.  This obviously leads to an increase in geo-political and diplomatic power and influence that we are witnessing today. As the world enters the \\"Age of China\\" and Chinese domination in East Asia and other areas of the world, it's necessary to be informed and knowledgeable as much as possible about China.    As for Kissinger, he has supporters, neutral observers, and those who oppose him and loathe him.  But if a reader solely focuses on the book as a piece of work about a nation and concept, \\"One China\\" appropriately delves sufficiently into different and important areas of China: this book examines China historically, contemporarily, and pontificates about the future.      The common questions of today can be better pondered with more knowledge acquired in this book: what ramifications if any, will there be with China as a/the global leader, as the United States declines?   This question is likely the reason for the publishing of this book by Kissinger (and others in the first)  Many of these book hit the best-seller list.  But what makes this lengthy work by Kissinger unique is that it's a historical account written by a man (Kissinger) who's met Mao, Zhou Enlai, Deng, and others personally.    As the author and Nixon initiated Detente, Kissinger's comprehensive historical focus on China in its foreign policy is a significant positive of this book.  From the very beginnings to the 20th Century, at length covering Mao and Zhou Enlai, China's relationship with the Soviet Union, and its role in the Korean war, to Deng Xiaoping, to today.  This book (common with Kissinger books) contains numerous citations and is primarily a historical piece of work.      The period of Deng Xiaoping is given adequate attention as it was Deng who made many of the moves to transform China into whatit currently has become (not saying they were all necessarily good).  Is the China of today better because of Deng's changes?  This is another topic, and a hypothetical one. Kissinger does not mention the human rights issue however,  as Kissinger avoids this negative aspect and other criticisms. I'll note that although I don't trust the leaders of my own country, I'll never trust the Han-Chinese.    Admittedly having only read a few book about China, Kissinger's book is comparable to some of the other well-known books released in recent years about China. As with most books of this genre, if someone already knows more than the basics of Chinese history and in particular China's history of the 20th Century, he/she may not gain much new knowledge.  Other works on China that focus primarily on the economic rational and reality of China are also worth reading (e.g. Jim Rogers), IMO.

B004Q7DQLS|5.0|I ordered this book on Kindle only because of the rave reviews it's received - and I wasn't disappointed.  What a pleasure - I started it last night and finished it an hour ago.  I have never written a review but felt I had to break the mould with this book.<br /><br />Pia is an unknown half-breed Wyr who is paranoid about keeping her identity a secret - even from us readers - even though there are several hints throughout as to what she may be.  The story unfolds after revealing a part of her secret to her ex-boyfriend and he blackmails her with it. Pia's strength is her total lack of egotism, a gentleness right down to her soul, a desire to belong and a plethora of witty one-liners ... she had me giggling into my kindle on more than one occasion...damn damnedy damnit!!  Dragos..well..what can I say...obviously gorgeous, obviously tall, dark and handsome...and so archaic you want to cheer him on every time he proffers a gentlemanly come-back. And as for the first sexual encounter..whew!<br /><br />If this is Ms Harrison's debut album then I will be one of those fans pre-ordering her next installment! Unlike other romance stories, I never once wanted to grab either Pia or Dragos and shake them, yelling \\"wake up and smell the coffee\\"! This book flowed smoothly from one scene to the next and I was amazed to realise at the end that only 6 days had passed in their world!

B004529NKM|5.0|This is it! With every Step Up movie that comes out, it just gets better and better! This movie really could be its own movie and doesn't really need to connect with the first two movies. But still, it does connect in a way. In the last two movies, the main story was about a troubled young adult star that goes to a performing art school for high school. Then, through dance, he/she learns to have a better life and has a bring future.<br /><br />In this movie there is more depth with the story. It's about a guy named Luke. He finds and leads a group of talented dancers to become a family of dancers all with their own unique style of dance. All these dancers want to make it big as dancers, but have no where to go to do that until Luke comes and lead them. Another new dancer that Luke finds is Moose and he is a return actor from Step Up 2. Moose doesn't know what he wants to do about dance because he is actually going to school as an engineering major. He then decides to join the group. Another dancer in the grop is Natalie. There a whole plot story with her but I don't want to spolier it for you and won't tell what that is. There still another of other things that I haven't talked about the movie yet, but instead you should watch it and enjoy it.<br /><br />In this movie you will hear amazing music, and see hot dance moves! I really recommend this dance movie. It is easily the best and actually made the most money worldwide as well. There's a lot of great movie extras to see in the DVD/Blu-ray and was my mine reason why I bought it. :)<br /><br />---Update---<br /><br />I just finished watching Step Up Revolution.(A.K.A Step Up 4.) Let me tell you that it wasn't as good as the commercials made it out to be.<br /><br />Step Up 3 is still my favorite Step Up movie of all time!!! The newest Step Up just didn't have enough interesting story, dance, or on screen chemistry as much as this film did.
B003FSTN52|5.0|Because of scheduling problems, I am not able to watch this series on TV.  I have heard a lot of good things about this show from friends, and the critics sure like it.  Still, I didn't think I would love it as much as I do!    The writers do an amazing job of writing episodes that hold your interest.  And the actors are extraordinary.     I highly recommend you join the list of fans.
0061134007|4.0|I read this book a few years ago and distinctly remember the best part being the characters, in particular Harry Hole.  But I also remember the author's penchant to make the storyline as complex as possible.  The plot has multiple strands that come together in the end--but they allow the writer to explore issues (skin heads, Norway's involvement in the second world war) that are well beyond the norm in the mystery/thriller genres.  The fact that he can maintain the reader's interest with the complicated story throughout does say a lot about his narrative skills.  However the \\"mystery\\" itself is a bit of let down, which fortunately is more than compensated by the twisted threads among the police force.  In the end the characters made this book a far more memorable experience than the central mystery itself, to the point where I bought following two books.  3.5 stars rounded up to 4 stars.

B0044DEAUA|4.0|The speakerphone is a simple and affordable way to get hands-free phone capabilities while driving. The voice clarity, both receiving and transmitting, is good, provided the car radio is off. In our car the radio creates interference so that the other party cannot hear the driver unless the radio is turned off. (Simply reducing the radio volume does not help.) I don't know if this is a function of our car model (a Toyota Solara) or if it is problematic for all vehicles.
B004FGMDOQ|1.0|Wildly over-rated. I am a huge reader and bought this novel based on several positive reviews. Boy were those reviews off the mark... Neither is this book scary, creative nor interesting. The characters are under-developed and aside from the creepy photos in the book, one would never have any affinity for the characters.  If you are even THINKING of buying this book steer clear and purchase any of Stephen King's early novels like Pet Sematary or Thinner or Stand By Me short Story
0440242401|5.0|I think this was my favorite Kinsella book yet!  This one is a page-turner...You won't be able to put it down!  Every time a chapter ends, yu have to keep going to see what becomes of Lexi's relationship with her husband Eric or what becomes of Lexi's relationship with Jon.  It's  impossible not to keep going!  The book ends perfectly too, rigt where it should.  It leaves yo feeling good, yet not kowing all the answers which is perfect.  Highly recommend it!
B004MNVKVO|2.0|What a let-down. The best Rush album in pristine 96khz 24bit resolution could have and SHOULD have been epic. Not so. It's compressed, loud, and harsh in the high end. Hold on to your vinyl copies or try the Mobile Fidelity gold disc version of this classic. It's still the best digital alternative if you can find it. I'm giving this review a two-star for effort. Hopefully we'll see more music in blu-ray high rez-- and done \\"right\\" for a change.
B004LWZVZC|3.0|Redford's heavy-handed portrayal of the US' treatment of war criminals rang pretty hollow in the theater the day we went to see this film---it was the day after the assassination of Osama Bin Laden, and even at that time, information was trickling out that the 9/11 Mastermind's whereabouts were provided via interrogation methods practiced in POW camps. Too bad for Mary Surratt---Even through the refining lens of a century and a half of events and experiences, the audience was all too aware of the \\"ends justify the means\\" scenario being played out on the international stage and couldn't really drum up much support for the woman who owned the \\"plot--hatching nest\\" for the Lincoln kidnap/assassination conspiracy. (Perhaps Redford could have argued for a change of venue for the film's release?)<br /><br />Historical details and characterizations aside, the only character that came across as more than a 2-dimensional parody of the players at that time was James McAvoy, who played the role of Surratt's lawyer, Frederick Aiken. He brought depth to the role as he struggled with his involvement in the entire episode---as a Civil War veteran who loved his Commander-in-Chief, to a young lawyer devestated by the murder of his president, to a young man whose eyes are opened to the possibility that \\"gray areas\\" exist in ALL matters of life & death and that even those accused of the worst crimes deserve fair treatment at the hands of the government. His transformation from dewy-eyed legal infant to a more jaded realist caught and pummeled by the system he strove to defend was the one stand-out performance in an otherwise lackluster field of acting. Alexis Bloedl (\\"OMG! Rory Gilmore!\\") simpered her way from devoted girlfriend to socially-aware bit player with a few eye rolls and well-placed head shakes; Kevin Kline, often brilliant in other roles, couldn't get the audience past the concept that he was playing an inherently evil Secretary of War who had no  agenda other than holding, manipulating and trampling on the rights of the accused (\\"Let's see....What shall I do today? I know! I'll destroy the lives of as many undesireables as possible, and I'll look good while doing it!\\") Robin Wright as Mary Surratt, brought a quiet graciousness to the role and provided a meek counterpart to the seething deviousness of those on the government's payroll; her devotion to the protection of her children and the preservation of her family outweighed her desire for life or freedom, and this came across fairly well in spite of the blusterings of the men engaged in determining her ultimate fate.<br /><br />In short---this film has wonderful historic detail in depicting the tumultuousness of a healing country in its post-Civil War era; unfortunately, it does not offer the same examination of the complexity of character of the people involved in promoting that healing.ulating and trampling on the rights of the accused (\\"Let's see....What shall I do today?

B004EPYZPS|4.0|\\"Super 8\\" is director J.J. Abrams's tribute to Steven Spielberg's \\"E.T.,\\" with a tip of his hat to Rob Reiner's \\"Stand By Me.\\"<br /><br />The film takes place in 1979, with a group of pre-teenage and barely teenage kids--led by the overweight Charles (Riley Griffiths) making a Super 8mm movie about zombies for a film competition. The makeup specialist, Joe (Joel Courtney), falls in love--during the filming--with the female lead in the production, Alice (Elle Fanning). They are both sensitive--having lost their mothers.<br /><br />During a nighttime film shoot, a train is derailed, when it hits a truck that goes on the tracks, and explosions and intrigue ensue, with the Air Force soon appearing. Gradually (a bit too much so), we learn why dogs are running off to the next county, why people are vanishing, and why microwave ovens are missing.<br /><br />I liked the solid acting by the youthful cast, especially by Fanning and Courtney, who establish a very moving relationship with each other.<br /><br />Overall, this film held my interest fairly well and jolted me a few times as I munched on some popcorn. It will be worth watching again when Netflix has it, but I doubt I'll want to buy the DVD.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I am giving this book a full 5 stars, because George R.R. Martin deserves the credit for a well written and deftly woven book. I will not write a detailed review of his work; there is so much already written in the series of reviews here on Amazon. In summary, he writes an exciting story, and although it can get very complicated with the intrigue and (occasionally) confusing array of family names (some of them awefully similar at times), I love the series (and this is my second reading of it!).<br /><br />But I give RANDOM HOUSE DIGITAL (the listed seller) a 1 STAR for making Amazon charge the same price for the Kindle edition as for the paperback. Come on, that feels like gouging and profit taking at best. I bought the Kindle because I love the technology and the convenience. BUT, I also bought it because I feel it is a much better use of the earth's resources in general: less paper, no fuel to move around physical books, etc. AT THE SAME TIME, I expect the sellers to \\"meet me part way\\" and charge a REASONABLE price which fairly compensates the author and provides them profit, but reflects the fact that they did not have to print the book on paper and physically distribute it. Selling the Kindle edition for the same price as the paperback makes no sense to me. The seller - IMHO - is simply putting the savings in their pocket, rather than passing on at least SOME of those savings to the reader while retaining the original profit.<br /><br />I am VERY disappointed in Random House Digital (the seller) for this pricing strategy. I certainly hope they reconsider what they are charging for Kindle books (at least these) in the future.
B000056NX5|5.0|The remake of the original version of Jesus Christ Superstar updates costumes and scenery.  The music is as wonderful as ever.  It is fun to compare this version with the original.  Both are worth having in your personal library collection.  It makes a wonderful Easter gift.  Make sure you are aware that the costumes are really over the top and could be inappropraite for the younger viewer.
B004NIFSRA|1.0|Actually 200 pages of nothing...as a eBook I think it's a failure, nobody will get the joke, people will only think the file got corrupted or something like this...<br />And as a paperback it's waaaaay to expensive for absolutely nothing...
B001JV5BIA|1.0|This 1972 attempt at a horror movie is painfully bad, a cinematic disaster on all levels. It is utterly boring, completely amateurish, and more likely to inspire annoyance than terror. It fails in every way. Even the music is totally inappropriate for a horror movie. It is far beneath any episode of \\"Gilligan's Island\\"; yes, it's that bad! Anything currently available on your TV is better--including static.

B0002VEW1K|5.0|My grandmother's house was made of books. Mine is made of records and compact discs. When I die I'll move into the \\"cloud\\"--maybe. The copy of Exotic Birds and Fruit we have is the FridayMusic version. It has the Blue Danube bonus track. Superb. Nice touch. So here it is. 1974. In with the pounding Nothing But the Truth. Ah, just like my old Procol Harum. All songs here are Brooker-Reid. Well, except the Johann Strauss 2 piece. As Strong as Samson is a tuneful anthem--lyrics pretty current reading. The Idol is pure Procol. One of my favorite tracks is The Thin Edge of the Wedge. Great riff. Great sound. Perhaps the most unusual cut on the album, but I like it when artists with the instrumental and vocal chops step up the game by going somewhere different. Monsieur R. Monde is a crunchy rocker, Fresh Fruit--well, we all know by now, eh? Butterfly Boys is another good one and the lead guitar takes off a bit. New Lamps For Old harkens back to early phases/poses and is another perfect Brooker vehicle. Drunk Again is the B side of Nothing But the Truth and kind of a fun romp. Really well done set of songs and they certainly picked up the pace. The opening cut could be covered today with positive result. The Blue Danube is the real reason to have this version. Sensitive reading--tinkling and all. The current price, however, is beyond ridiculous. Especially for a digital object. UPDATE. Well, when I wrote this it was up around $90.
0062060554|5.0|From the time I had read an excerpt of this book, on Amazon, I could hardly wait for the book to arrive. I immediately started reading it, and could not put it down. After reading a few chapters, of Before I Go to Sleep, I knew I had to have my wife read it. I need to get her view point, of what Christine, was going through. This is a very engrossing read, hard to put down, and always on my mind, when not reading it. One of the best this year!
B004LROMSY|4.0|I do realize that it's a matter of opinion that people write on these reviews. That being said, if you don't like it, then just say that. Don't try to steer people away by falsely claiming it was poorly written, or had bad casting, or was a bad series. I am one of the biggest movie/TV fans around, and I'm highly critical of most shows. That being said, this show is phenomenal.<br /><br />Set aside Joseph Finnes always top notch acting, this show was well done. Well written, well acted for a relatively lesser known cast, and well worth watching again.<br /><br />If you are a fan of this type of show, buy the blu ray. You won't be disappointed. With gorgeous cinematography to boot, you may not like it, but you can't blame this show for being any negatives a few critics are pushing.

1439102724|5.0|This is an extraordinary novel about the conflicts between fundamentalist religion and personal freedom.    \\"Sing You Home\\" has 40 year old music therapist Zoe Baxter trying to survive multiple in-vitro fertilizations, the loss of her husband, and serious illness to move on with her life alone.  Her husband Max - who feels that Zoe's efforts to have a child have destroyed their marriage - first degrades into alcoholism, and then becomes involved in a fundamentalist religion through his brother's influence.  After a while, Zoe finds a new love - a fellow school employee, Vanessa Shaw.  Although they live in Rhode Island, they get married in Massachusetts.  While on their honeymoon, Zoe is regretting that she can never bear children - and that there are three embryos still in storage at the IVF clinic.  Vanessa responds, \\"I can.\\"  But they need biological father Max's permission to use the embryos.  When Max brings his brother Reid and his pastor Cliff into the decision, a bitter legal battle ensues, filled with all the accusations and misstatements one would expect in any such conflict.  High powered attorneys for both sides fight it out in court, with an end result no one would expect.
B00362FO0K|5.0|Michael Jackson-the best artist ever lived on this planet. I saw this concert in movie theatre and loved it, so i had to have it on blu-ray. So if you a Michael Jackson fan or like to become one, you have to have this dvd.
0679805273|4.0|\\"Oh, the Places You'll Go\\" is a book that breaks from its genre of a children's book into the mainstream because the message of the book is universal. It is a perennial bestseller, especially popular during graduation time. Even though it has been many years since I graduated from college, this book still has reasonance in my life. Life is full of transitions. Some of them in which you may feel that you are fighting against all odds to reach where you want to be. I like to refer to this book for inspiration and remind myself that life is a journey when this happens. It is truly a book for all ages, relatable to for children and adults alike.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|hate to tell you guys this, but it's unlikely we'll ever see the theatrical releases on blu-ray.    Lucas can say all he wants about remasters and how expensive it is to remaster blah blah blah.     there are enough fanboys out there who have access to the equipment needed.. Lucas could crowdsource remasters of the theatrical releases and not pay a cent (but reap all the profits).    ... one star because this includes the \\"first\\" 3 movies which don't exist in my reality (LALALALAIAMNOTLISTENINGTOYOUGEORGE)    i don't mind the extra CGI in the background so much, but Han/Greedo and the Jabba/spaceport scene rewrites really ruined it for me.
0307279189|5.0|Let me start by saying this is my first review.  That in and of itself should say something.      I titled this review \\"This book is in the work section\\".  It is.  I'm a runner, but I've never read a running book.  I tend to think these sorts of things are over the top self congratulatory hyperbole. I really don't need to read about some guy I've never heard of story of over coming adversity to achieve greatness and why I can too.  So when I saw this book in the running section I was cautious.  It is not a running book.  Let me say that again, IT IS NOT A RUNNING BOOK!  I think other reviews are right, in that it succeeds on multiple levels.  You could take out ever third chapter and it would read like a good novel, with a suspenseful climax.  You could read it as a study in how the modern world fails western culture.  You could read it as a marathoning or trail running guide. You could read it as a philosophy/sociology/anthropology thesis. Ultimately it is all of these things.    If you read this book, and you are not inspired to get out on the trail, do your own thing and run/walk/crawl down the trail I'll be surprised.  Where the book is most successful, is in making something that 99.9% of Americans would feel is literally crazy (running 50+ mile races) seem reasonable, and even potentially fun.  It make we want to figure out how these guys do it, and yes, I'm thinking about doing an ultra.  I know I CAN now. The book removed my excuses.

0316069353|3.0|I could have easily given this book 4 or 4 1/2 stars because after a slow start it held my attention very well.  As a courtroom drama pitting the arrogant Andrea Freeman as prosecutor against the plucky and aggressive Mickey Haller, as defense attorney, it was working very well.  Mickey's evolving strategy was convincing and clever, and also convincing was his increasing confidence in the actual innocence of his client (even with her occasional acrimonious outbursts).<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT.<br />A hard won fight, and he wins it, fair and square.  You feel that justice, the law, the attorney, his staff, and the client have all been vindicated.  Then Connelly destroys it all in the last two pages with a stupid, stupid, stupid ending.  I don't get it.  He could have (and should have) provided instead an explanation of how the \\"bad guys\\" planted the hammer and Lisa's shoes as evidence against her in the set-up.  That the crime was all about greed and corporate deals involving huge amounts of money as Haller had protested in the trial.  Not about a single act of violence by a stalker, which by the way did not ring true in the slightest, as his little hints and innuendos throughout the book about Lisa do not add up to her being a hidden psychopath.<br /><br />Instead of a great finish where the hard-working lawyer triumphs against corporate greed, we get the awful, ridiculous revelation that Haller had once again been a total chump and busted his you know what to represent a lying, cheating guilty party.  That not only had Lisa murdered Mitchell Bondurant, but also her husband.  Give me a break!!!?? Just like in Lincoln Lawyer. Aarggh!.  Why do all of the plots of Connelly's books involving Mickey Haller have to be the same?  Haller works his b*** off.  \\"Gets client off.  Client is guilty after all.  What a chump I am.  I have no morality.  I represent the low-lifes of society.  Also, I can't see one reason on earth why Lisa would have sent the two thugs to beat up Haller, who's defending her very well in the trial.  That makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.  Aargh.  I was so disappointed.  He ruined an almost 5 star book in the last two pages.  Why???ng her very well in the trial.  That makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.  Aargh.  I was so disappointed.  He ruined an almost 5 star book in the last two pages.  Why???
1936719010|4.0|As you've probably noticed by now, this book has mixed reviews: some people hate it, and some people love it. Overall this is an excellent, short book to read--but it should not be taken out of context. It seems to me that reviewers giving it negative press do not appreciate the purpose of the book, and are taking its messages literally.<br /><br />The purpose of this book is to inspire you to pursue greatness. The author does a great job of explaining what natural resistance is to work, and how to overcome it--through numerous situational stories. The theme includes lots of motivational-type rhetoric, that servers to build your adrenaline, and make you fiercely decide to pursue your dreams, and turn them into reality.<br /><br />If you're looking for a book that explains through scientific method how to achieve greatness, this isn't the one for you. This book is designed to simply persuade you that you CAN, in fact, achieve great things by simply working hard, and never giving up.<br /><br />I'm giving this book 4 out of 5 stars because it was an excellent, motivational, and well written book. I'm not giving it 5/5 stars because it was extremely short, and could have been expanded to cover more topics (and perhaps, scientific studies) to reinforce the author's ideas.<br /><br />If you're having problems with motivation, discipline, and/or achievement, give this book a read. It only takes about 1 hour to read through, and will certainly help pump-you-up for the battles ahead.

B001EB5CDE|4.0|I first heard Megadeth on \\"Countdown To Extinction\\" which still is my favourite album of theirs but prior to the well-deserved \\"sell-out\\" that led to their lucrative payday \\"Rust In Peace\\" took thrash metal to another dimension crucially because of the addition of new but brilliant guitarist Marty Friedman.  Dave Mustaine having once been associated with Metallica which I believe to be the greatest metal band ever with Iron Maiden coming in a close second I guess continued comparisons between the two \\"M\\"s are inevitable and to me \\"Rust In Peace\\" is to \\"Ride the Lightning\\" as \\"Countdown To Extinction\\" is to \\"The Black Album\\" and just as in \\"Ride the Lightning\\" it took me a few listens to better appreciate the work it took a few listens for me to realise just how good \\"Rust In Peace\\" is at least musicianship-wise; I still don't like much of Mustaine's lyrics and really singing about alien conspiracies leaves me cold when I compare that with the more meaty and real-life meaningful lyrics of the vast majority of Metallica's pre-\\"Load\\" of crap albums.<br /><br />Still, this is a very good thrash album and fans are in for a treat here in this the mini-lp replica sleeve (mlps) version of the album.  The mlps design in itself isn't that great as I've seen much better designs and overall assembly but the inner jacket sleeve is well done coming with an insert with all the lyrics in both English and Japanese but most importantly with a short write-up by Dave Mustaine himself about the album which was a nice treat.  The all important sound quality is very good having been adequately remastered for an improved sound over the original cd release.  The bonus tracks also add to the overall enjoyment of the album not being mindless afterthought fillers:<br /><br />10. My Creation<br />11. Rust In Peace...Polaris (Demo)<br />12. Holy Wars...The Punishment Due (Demo)<br />13. Take No Prisoners (Demo)<br /><br />While I enjoyed the tracks on the next album a lot better I have to admit that overall musicianship-wise as an all-out thrash album this is not only Megadeth's best album but it is also among the top 20 metal albums of all time and would rank even higher if the lyrics on some tracks were stronger.  Still it is no accident that both this and \\"Countdown ...\\" are my favorite Megadeth albums and that Marty Friedman played his ass off on both albums; what a great guitarist!<br /><br />Ok mlps design, very good content and good sound quality makes this an easy review.<br /><br />Recommended!all-out thrash album this is not only Megadeth's best album but it is also among the top 20 metal albums of all time and would rank even higher if the lyrics on some tracks were stronger.

B002ZG98G4|3.0|When Becky Fuller (played by Rachel McAdams) is fired as a TV station executive producer she is employed to turn around the fortunes of a small, struggling breakfast show called Daybreak.  She changes some of the show format and brings in a new co-anchor played by Harrison Ford.  He is serious and dour and only wants to report on the news that will win him awards and which he deems newsworthy.  There is also a love interest thread thrown in for good measure.<br /><br />The trailer made `Morning Glory' seem way more funnier than it actually is and whilst I laughed out loud a few times, it was disappointing overall.  It kind of feels as if the writer and director didn't want to think too hard with this project and it is film-making `by numbers'.  It feels formulaic and clich&eacute;d.  McAdams is really good and what saves this film from being truly awful, but Harrison is unremarkable and a disappointment.  His accent is annoying and his acting is wooden and uninspiring.  Diane Keaton is great as the co-anchor and she always adds something to any film she stars in.<br /><br />All in all this is an ok film, but nothing truly outstanding.  I felt more disappointed than I should have after watching the trailer and expecting great things (but that's the job of a trailer I guess).  The love interest aspect is superfluous and whilst relatively charming it doesn't add a great deal to the film.  This is an innocuous, light hearted film and makes for an entertaining couple of hours, don't expect too much and you'll be fine.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
0385335989|5.0|Perhaps in most books in a long series, by the fourth book they seem to get dull and unimportant. Not so in the Outlander series. After the second reading of \\"Drums of Autumn\\" I realize that this series is perhaps the greatest in the world. Though book four lacks more sex scenes which made the first three books awesome, it is just as adventurous and exciting.     Clair and Jamie, though dominant characters in the books, take a little bit of a backseat, since Bree, their daughter, comes into her own in an attempt to find her parents in the past. Just behind her is Roger, the Oxford man that had helped to find Jamie for Claire and Bree, also able to travel into the past. The story takes place in pre-revolutionary America, and the knowledge that Claire has of future events is always in the back of your mind. More on that in the next book of course.    I can't recommend this series enough, and I plan on reading these stories again and again and again.
B004LWZW4C|5.0|Eleven years ago 20th Century Fox and director Bryan Singer introduced the world at large to the idea of mutants living among us with the box office smash \\"X-Men\\". Following that success a couple of years later with \\"X2: X-Men United\\", which was an even bigger blockbuster and an even better movie. However, when Bryan Singer left the franchise to direct \\"Superman Returns\\", some would argue the franchise lost its way with the likes of the critically maligned \\"X-Men: The Last Stand\\" and \\"X-Men Origins: Wolverine\\".    Personally, I enjoyed both of those films (as did many audiences based on their box office receipts), although I do recognize their flaws. To those critics and even some fans that were displeased with the aforementioned last two installment into the franchise, a new entry has come along to right those proverbial wrongs. That film is the critically acclaimed \\"X-Men: First Class\\" from director Matthew Vaughn (\\"Layer Cake\\"), with Bryan Singer serving as a producer this time around.    \\"X-Men: First Class\\" explores the friendship between Professor Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and Erik Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender). Set in the early 1960's, the two one-time friends and veritable leaders of the mutant race, join forces with the CIA to discover and train new mutants in the use of their powers. However, when a dangerous mutant named Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) sets into motion events that could lead to nuclear war; Charles, Erik and their team of mutant recruits must band together to save mankind.    When this film was initially announced I was excited because at the time Bryan Singer was attached to direct. However, shortly thereafter Singer was forced to drop out due to scheduling conflicts, and eventually director Matthew Vaughn was hired to take over the reins.    It was upon this revelation that my excitement for the prequel began to wane because Matthew Vaughn had already balked at the chance to direct an X-Men feature with \\"X-Men: The Last Stand\\". Thus,my confidence in him wasn't exactly solid. That was before I watched his surprisingly entertaining, tongue planted firmly in cheek, comic book adaptation \\"Kick-@$$\\".    After seeing the aforementioned film, my concern for the X-Men franchise was quickly dissipating. My thought was so long as Matthew Vaughn, and company, remained relatively faithful to the material, plus made every attempt possible to ensure this is the best in the series; then the future of the franchise would be in good hands.    So, let me say that I for one can attest that \\"X-Men: First Class\\" not only delivered the goods, but surpassed almost every one of my expectations. If you are one of the fans or critics or general moviegoers that were disappointed to some degree with any of the previous films, then this movie should easily renew your faith in the franchise.    Written by Ashley Miller and Zack Stentz (\\"Thor\\") the story for \\"X-Men: First Class\\" is jam-packed with history for not only the franchise, but even some actual world history to boot (albeit with a comic book slant). Not to mention terrific character beats (especially for the primary cast members); plus, taking considerable care to not trample too much upon the continuity that had been established by the previous films in the series.    Admittedly there were some minor contradictions between this film and the rest of the series; however, they can be forgiven or explained away in later sequels. So I digress.    On top of all that the film boasts some very entertaining action and visual effects set pieces that are some of the best this series has ever had to offer. From the scenes of the various young mutants training to harness their abilities to the film's climactic moments, the visual spectacle on display is well worth the price of admission.    As always the best scripts, action, visual effects, and directors and crew members are all for naught if the cast can't step up to deliver the goods too. And this cast delivered with great ease and nearly flawless execution.    Leading the cast are two very talented actors: one is the more recognizable James McAvoy (\\"Wanted\\") portraying Charles Xavier, and the other is the soon to be recognizable, due to this role, Michael Fassbender (\\"300\\").    At the onset of this film you can forget some of your preconceived notions for the character of Charles Xavier that you may have gleamed from comics or the movies. Here we are introduced to a version of the character that's willing to be somewhat ethically loose with his powers. For example, he is not above using his telepathic abilities to hit on women in bars and such.    Now, I understand that some could be turned off by this take on the character in his younger years, and therefore attempt to write off the film in the process. However, actor James McAvoy manages to portray this time in Xavier's life with such charm and personality that you can't help but be drawn in by him.    And when the character begins to embrace his destiny as a potential future leader of mutants, McAvoy naturally shifts gears with the character. Over the course of his story arc James begins tempering the more spirited side to Xavier with an over-bearing sense of responsibility and a strong ethical moral code that we all know from the original trilogy.    As for the future Magneto, actor Michael Fassbender portrays this younger Erik Lehnsherr with much more volatility than we've ever seen from the character. However, with that temperament, we also see an underlying sadness that is constantly at odds with his intense anger and aggression.    When we see those flashes of sadness come to the surface of Erik, Michael truly excels at playing them off with genuine surprise and bewilderment from the character. Seeing these moments of vulnerability seep into the role was a fresh approach to Erik that we had not seen previously.    Plus, witnessing the transition of Erik from a man consumed by vengeance and lacking any real sense of direction to a man with a mission and purpose in life was extremely satisfying and intriguing to watch.    Separately both James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender were great, but their shared scenes are simply excellent. The natural rapport the two share onscreen perfectly conveys the brotherly relationship the characters once shared in the comics.    Honestly, if the Academy was willing to take a chance on another comic book property for a potential award nomination (beyond the visual and sound effects categories), then this film and its two lead actors could easily snag a nod. Of course, this most likely will not happen, but the fact that they could be considered worthy is a testament to the quality of this movie.    Alongside the two leads are a plethora of actors and actresses delivering very solid turns, even if their characters aren't given as much to do as the aforementioned. The two biggest standouts from the supporting cast of young mutants are Mystique and Beast, played by Jennifer Lawrence (\\"Winter's Bone\\") and Nicholas Hoult (\\"Clash of the Titans\\").    These two young talents deliver strong performances, and provide a different perspective on the events of the film than that of the leads. For me, I was pleasantly surprised by the fact that the movie spent as much time as it did showcasing the viewpoint of the \\"students\\"; especially, since the driving force of the film was the early years of Charles and Erik.    On the villainous side of things, we have Kevin Bacon (\\"Hollow Man\\") and January Jones (TV's \\"Mad Men\\"), portraying Sebastian Shaw and his femme fatale, Emma Frost respectively.    Between the two, Kevin gave the stronger performance, not to mention having more to do within the story. His portrayal of Sebastian Shaw was an interesting blend of a charismatic, suave, and sophisticated business man, mixed with a cold and calculating killer, devoid of any vestige of humanity.    To his credit, Kevin could have played the role over-the-top, which seems to be the temptation for so many actors when playing characters with a clear messiah complex, but he didn't. Instead, he opted to play things more subdued and both the character and the film benefited.    Now, a moment ago, when I said that Kevin's performance was the stronger of the two, that wasn't to say that January Jones didn't deliver on her end. On the contrary, January did a good job portraying Emma, a character whose beauty belies the cold-hearted mutant she truly is.    Some have complained that January seemed too emotionless and detached, but that's the way her character should be, so her portrayal would be accurate. It's just so many times critics aren't aware of the source material (I know I'm guilty of this too), and judge based solely on what they see whether that's the way the character is supposed to be or not.    So, in the end, with all the terrific performances, excellent storytelling, and great visual effects and action sequences, \\"X-Men: First Class\\" is an outstanding movie! Serving as a perfect introduction to those who may be unfamiliar with the film franchise or its comic book source material, but also providing longtime fans another excellent entry into the franchise that easily erases any ill-will garnered from the last two installments.    \\"X-Men: First Class\\" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.
B004HO6HWA|5.0|I saw this movie recently on an airplane going to Singapore.  It kept me on the edge of my seat the entire movie.  (I never saw the original, so I didn't know this was a re-make.)  This was surprisingly well done...great special effects and acting by Ben Foster.    The ending took me by surprise!  I must have seen 15 movies going to and from Singapore.  This is the only movie that stands out!!
B0036EH3U2|5.0|This collection was a real treat in video quality and offered a nice range of commentaries and extras.  As a relatively new fan, it was just nice to watch the show from beginning to end.
B0035G5IOE|5.0|Wow. I cannot believe that there are any 1 star ratings for this, but alas, some people are the kind of \\"different\\" that is not fantastic.    Granted this may not be your kids' cup of chocolate milk - especially if they are the same kids that like mindless trash like Power Rangers.    The Fantastic Mr. Fox is for all ages and it is the perfect package of imagination, wit, whimsy, and heart. Yes, the story is simple, but it's the execution that elevates it into something special.    To call the graphics poor is a great insult especially when it is very clear that the intent was not to reiterate the same artistic style that defines a majority of 3d animation today. The look is rustic, slightly messy, warm, and frankly refreshing. The artist in me appreciates it in every way. The music too, beautifully compliments the movie and is emotionally complex.    The movie explores topics like individuality, responsibility and consequences, and most importantly, compassion for family and friends. I love how they managed to juggle in all those wonderful bits around a story about food and survival (as a foodie, I can certainly understand the drive to attain fresh tasties lol)!    I can honestly say there are no faults to be found. It is liquid gold.

0743437497|5.0|Sometimes you'll read a book by a popular author and wonder what all the fuss is about, but occasionally you'll come across a work that proves that this writer is - or at least can be - the real deal. I do like this book better than the movie, and while the movie is praised for all the subtle subliminal touches kubrick supposedly added, I think the book is more subtle than the movie. For example, rather than the famous river of blood from the elevator seen in the movie, the book has the elevator filled with something less stereotypically horror but more effective due to the build-up. Even the mantra \\"Redrum\\" feels like less of a gimmick in the book because of the stronger focus on Jack Torrance's alcoholism. On the website \\"cinemassacre\\" the review of kubrick's \\"the shining\\" makes fun of the way it \\"tries to scare you over nothing\\" with a loud noise occurring when the word \\"tuesday\\" is shown. \\"Oh no, not tuesday!\\" jokes the reviewer James Rolfe. However in the book simple chapter titles like \\"snow\\" or \\"tony\\" do have a big emotional impact because of the places they appear and all the implication king has carefully laden those simple words with by that point in the story.    The story is not without flaw, and King doesn't always know when to be subtle and when to be brutally explicit, a problem reminiscent of the roque mallet that features so prominently in the story with one end rubber and the other end hard. King's trademark habit of rambling in brackets to remind us of something else that is scary and related to the currently scary thing happening sometimes feels like the prose equivalent of pounding music in a movie to remind us that a certain scene is supposed to inspire terror when the absence of such cues would probably make it more scary as they would make me feel I'm facing the terrifying thing on my own without the narrator to hold my hand and tell me what I should feel about it. Another slightly distracting feature of King's prose in \\"The Shining\\" is thatwhile his writing is frequently beautiful you can tell that he had the thesaurus handy, and it even invades the dialog with Jack Torrance using the word \\"dray\\" when being playful with his wife and son. Even with a character who is supposed to be a writer this somehow strained credibility for me. And one of the strongest aspects of the novel for me in the middle weakened the conclusion in my opinion - the scariness of not knowing how much of Jack's transformation to evil murderous maniac is because of the hotel and how much is caused by his own inner demons seems completely obliterated by the way his behavior is handled towards the end of the book. King says in \\"On Writing\\" that the scariest villains are those with believable motivations that you can almost relate to and it's quite creepy the way Jack's inner rationalisations which eventually lead him to violence almost seem reasonable, and how the same character we might have seen as sympathetic at the start doesn't seem to have had to change all that much to become the bad guy. But by the end he's painted as a decent guy possessed by a demonic hotel and you almost get the sense that the ending was written before the earlier sections detailing Jack's thoughts as he loses his way. But while flawed this is still a horror novel you need to read, and also a painful mediation on how some of the very things that make a man needed by his family - focus on career, discipline, determination and single-mindedness - can backfire and tear a family apart.
020530902X|5.0|This is a wonderful reference for anyone who writes anything, even thank you notes or emails. It is brief, to the point and readable.
B003YUC2FE|3.0|In the long run, only the second movie is worth repeated viewing. The 3rd movie involves malicious toys and extreme danger as part of a story line that needs neither of these; the essential story is about toys transitioning from one owner to another. The first movie is about toys realizing their nature. Does this storyline need a malicious, destructive juvenile to terrorize toys? It does not. The 2nd movie is the gem. It only sinks to a little human greed to move the plot that conveys the story of the role of toys in the lives of children. Go buy the second movie.
B0015AARJI|5.0|This is an excellent controller by Sony.  I highly recommend it.  Great price and fast shipping.  Would buy again.
B001V7YJMG|5.0|I must say I agree with the positive reviews, but I wanted to add mine in hopes of raising its 4-star customer rating to 5 stars.  It's a quiet sort of movie centered around the new-found relationship between Oskar and Eli.  Oskar has problems with being bullied at school and Eli helps build his confidence and gives advice on how to deal with them.  Yes, there are killings, as it is a vampire movie.  Can't always have packets or bottles from the blood bank.  What I'm trying to say is, this is a movie to think about and watch more than once.  In fact, I think I'd be interested in the book, since I understand from another reviewer that it goes into more details about Eli's background.  Eli doesn't say much except to ask Oskar questions and give advice.  The movie does an excellent job in presenting a day in the life of 1) Oskar, and alternatively, 2) Eli, and then the two of them together, at night.  This is a thoughtful look at the life of a lonely 12-year-old looking to make a change and a young-looking girl vampire who has change thrust upon her.

B004J4WLPU|5.0|I won't go into the details as other reviews give that info.  I loved this book--it was beautifully written and a great story too.  I will highly recommend this to my friends as it has been my fav book this year.
B0001I55OC|5.0|It seems the best thing about this movie, for most of the reviews I've read, it wasn't as good as the book. Think bout it, most movies aren't. The advantage I have on most reviewing \\"Timeline\\", I never read the book. So in my case it's just another good \\"Time Travel\\" movie, which I'm mostely partial to anyway. Great story, and like most of them, it's always fun how they all come together at the end. Timeline....think I'll watch it again....right now.
0670022411|1.0|I was tricked into buying this book by America's poular media: People Magazine's book review being the biggest offender. I am finding it disappointingly slow and tedious, quite along the lines of the miserable Twilight series. Maybe it's just not in my preferred genre; I tend to like police procedurals and authors like Michael Connelly and Henning Mankell. But I am ruing the $14.99 I spent to download to my Kindle and forcing myself to finish it because I paid for it. If you liked the Twilight series, this is the book for you, anyone else, steer clear.
B004EPYZUI|5.0|Two aussie chick in the lead rolls of an American blockbuster is heaven.  I think too many people are trying to overthink the plot.  As with any movie, watching it a second time will fill in any plot holes that you have missed the first time   There are plenty of youtube interviews with Emily and Abbie if you are still having trouble with the plot  And the visuals are fantastic.  Just watch it to be entertained.  Personally, I cant wait for the DVD
B0033AGPF8|5.0|Okay, so I'm a rabid Jimi fan. Sue me. I like other music too. However, I won't just buy any ole thing that comes down the \\"Jimi\\" pike and this is well worth the price paid.<br /><br />Sure we've all heard this album before but this vinyl pressing puts it into new light. Crisp highs, warm bass and incredible drum sounds. Simply amazing! Far -outshines- the CD versions of this record. With more \\"space\\" and depth between the instruments it's warmer and exceptionally realistic. It's like you're sitting cross-legged on the floor while the band plays.<br /><br />The guitars shriek and howl without any unpleasant high frequencies, sounding more like a \\"real\\" guitar. The mix is fabulous and you'll find yourself hearing things you didn't notice before - you'll say what instrument is THAT?. Very cool record that hits you right in the gut. All songs are great. Multiple listens yields greater results!<br /><br />I've read other reviews where someone stated they couldn't hear a difference between the CD and the vinyl, and I think this is very sad that one cannot discern between the two. With a fresh cover and a fresh groove, this will keep me going for years.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and get a GOOD pair of headphones, dim the lights, turn on the lava lamp and just relax; this is the best way to enjoy the mastery of Hendrix!
B0049P1VHS|5.0|this is one of the best tv series i have seen in a long time its unique there is no other tv series like it if u love zombies action and drama u are in for a treat its well worth the price and season 2 will be out soon so watch,buy or rent this today
B004DMIIO6|5.0|Remember the awesome Asian fliks of old? But kicking from start to finish. Or, you got a sob story packed full of the main character crying like a baby; a good emotional tale that shows the soft side of the usually indestructible hero with only a halfway decent fight or two. This film on the other hand, is one of the great ones that sit right in the middle in between the early Jackie Chan directed films previously unreleased in the states, and Storm Riders, one of the best for Dragon Ball Z style fighting. GOEMON has an amazing emotional story that builds throughout and really makes you feel something for the characters, multiple characters, not just the hero 'Goemon'. This movie doesn't just jump from fight scene to fight scene with some poorly written filler masquerading as a plot line, it does rely heavily on the brilliant story but, the fighting that it does have in itself certainly makes the movie worth buying, even if your the type that isn't into watching all that \\"talking crap\\" ...or reading crap if you prefer subtitles like myself. So, DO NOT miss out. This is a -good movie- the whole way through, no matter what your martial arts movie preferences are.

B003C5FMEE|5.0|What's not to like about this CD?  In particular, if you find yourself listening to old school NoLa jazz but would like something updated for this century, you'll definitely like this CD.  Great for listening to while at work, or while crashing on the couch after a day at work.  There really aren't any weak tracks on this album.  You'll be happy you added this to your collection!
B004SKIPXW|3.0|If you're looking for a vendetta movie where Nicolas Cage goes cross country with his beautiful co-star, with plenty of decent driving, stunts and gun fights, and a cool William Fichtner as a matrix-like special Agent sent to capture Cage, then this is worth checking out. The story is bare bones though, and nothing to get excited about, but the pacing and action deliver a decent experience with some neat moments. The driving, for all of Nic Cage's supposed skill behind the wheel, is only average at best thanks mostly due to its slower pace.<br /><br />The 3D is the real star here, and is executed as well as one could hope. The 3D stands out, so the foreground, mid and background pop out from each other, creating a very convincing illusion of depth. This was filmed with two cameras, not post converged (though post converged 3D can be just as good if done right).<br /><br />So if you own a 3DTV and could use a gritty, decent action movie with great 3D, this is worth a look.
B002SEQ92E|5.0|This came up in my Amazon quick picks so I decided to read the reviews to check on the transfer quality.  Started mentally lamenting the fact that so many films on my want list never turn up on the high-def movie channels, although even that isn't as frustrating as when they turn up once and once only and I stumble across them halfway through.  Did that on both Billion Dollar Brain and 52 pick-up.  Anyway, The reason I'm writing this is because I just checked the satellite tv listings and The Philadelphia Experiment is on the ENCORE high-def channel once and once only June 29, 2011.  Catch it if you can.  Probably won't get another chance until the SHOWTIME BEYOND channel goes hd.  ENCORE is also showing Freejack once only on June 19, 2011.   One last thought in a science fiction vein,  June 19th also sees the premiere of the new Independence Day type series Falling Skies on TNT and the new season of Drop Dead Diva on LIFETIME, plus new series Outcasts starts June 18th on BBCAMERICA.   Have to give a star rating to post this review, so I'm giving it 5 stars because I've always liked the film and another reviewer said the newer dvd had an excellent transfer.
B0055EAJ7A|4.0|Thor is a fun super hero movie of a son stripped of his trusty hammer (by his father played by Anthony Hopkins) and his powers along with it. His mysterious brother watches as their father casts Thor to earth. Through the help of his earth friends (Natalie Portman) and his team from his home planet, Thor must recover his hammer and defeat the evil pulling the strings of the impending ice-men invasion. A well told story, with plenty of nice action pieces, special effects and good pacing, this is a worthwhile addition to your super hero collection, and the 3D really shines.<br /><br />3D Review: The foreground pops clearly from the mid and background, resulting in a clear, impossible to miss 3D effect throughout most of the movie. Even though it was post converged 3D made after the film was finished in 2D, this doesn't matter, as the 3D is excellent and worth a purchase for 3DTV owners.<br /><br />Movie: 4/5 recommended<br />3D: 4/5 recommended
0807014273|5.0|Very easy read, not an easy topic, but it's message is profound. The gist of the book is, no matter your circumstances, you are responsible for your experience. That is singularly one of the most powerful truths. When we realize we are responsible for our lives and experiences, we will discover the gift of power. You want to have a happy productive life, create it. We are not the victims of our circumstances as Viktor Frankl writes, and if anyone realized that, it was Viktor Frankl. Do yourself a favor and read this book,  then pass the book along to someone that will appreciate it's value.
0596004966|3.0|I used to know C++ very well but have done little C++ programming in the past decade. I was hoping this book would include all the niggling little details I had forgotten. Looking through the book jogged my memory to help me remember these details, but I was surprised to see how many were not explicitly stated in the book. Perhaps the best example of a detail not included is the difference between overloading the preincrement and postincrement operators. One of them takes an extra dummy parameter, but the book does not mention this difference. The book explains how to declare a multidimensional array when the dimensions are known at compile time, but does not give a code sample explaining how to do so when the dimensions are not known until run time. The section describing return codes from main does not explain that zero indicates success and a non-zero value indicates an error.    Perhaps the most disappointing aspect of the book is how little is devoted to the standard library. No math functions are described. There is no discussion of how to format output. I was even hoping for discussion of the most basic uses of the STL. Instead, the book lists only the names of the header files and the four standard input and output streams with the most basic unformatted uses of these streams. The book covers the core C++ language fairly well, but almost none of the extensive standard library.

I have been slightly cheating during my diet times and yet i still lose roughly a pound a day. The book is filled with tons of info about dieting, sex, energy, Strength training. Every piece of info is backed up with data that it works and usually gives the reason as to why it works. Great book, great diet.
B001UV4XHY|3.0|As others have said, `Deathly Hallows Part I' is a good film for fans of the 7th book.  David Yates is faithful to the novel (to a fault, perhaps), and those who enjoyed reading JK Rowling's final book in the Harry Potter series will be satisfied (especially since `Part II' is coming to theaters in just a few weeks).<br /><br />As a stand-alone film, however, `Part I' suffers for the same reason Rowling's book suffers - too much exposition, too many over-complicated plot threads to set up, and too little action.  It's not that nothing happens - actually, Yates manages to include all of the action sequences from the first 500 pages of the novel (the escape from Privet Drive, the aftermath of the wedding, the visit to Godric's Hollow, the incident at Luna's house, the Gringotts break-in, etc.).  But it all feels somewhat like a series of disconnected scenes cobbled together with too much talking, whining, and camping in between.  Like the book, the film focuses almost exclusively on our trio of teenage heroes as they try to track down and destroy a series of Horcruxes (magical objects containing segmented parts of Voldemort's soul) while at the same time avoiding detection and capture by followers of the Dark Lord.  Unfortunately, an awful lot of exciting-sounding things are happening to the characters who are NOT Harry, Ron, and Hermione, but neither the book nor the film lets us experience any of them.  And these other characters are sorely missed.<br /><br />There is so much sheer plot in this movie that it's difficult to keep up with it - there are so many things we need to understand to make sense of it all (the mythology of Horcruxes, the meaning of the titular Deathly Hallows, convoluted wand lore . . . and how they all play into the mission to bring down Voldemort and save the world for Wizards and Muggles alike).  And none of it goes anywhere in this film.  The final film will probably be more satisfying, since it actually has an ending . . . `Part I' does not.<br /><br />Several characters die in `Part I' - only one of them generates the kind of pain I expected (and as we see in the novel).  If anything, Yates sacrificed the emotional heart of the story in trying to stay so close to the overriding plot, probably the result of breaking the novel into two parts.  The pay-off will come in `Part II,' so it may all come together fine in the end.  Actually, Yates has a chance to improve on the novel in this final film - Rowling left us hanging a bit with her final few chapters (no Harry/Snape resolution, no Harry/Ginny reunion, no sense of the aftermath of that final battle at Hogwarts).  The `Part II' trailers suggest that Yates may have understood this.  I hope so.<br /><br />If you love the Potter universe, you've undoubtedly already seen this film.  If you're just curious, watch the other movies first.  And wait until July 14 to watch `Part I' - then you can rush right out and see `Part II' on July 15.  Perhaps together the films will do what `Part I' can't do alone.<br /><br />One final note - I watched this on a standard DVD on a pretty ordinary and inexpensive TV, and I did not find the scenes excessively dark or difficult to see.  Since so many reviewers mentioned the poor quality of the \\"transfer\\" on the DVD, I'm not sure what this means.  I had no problems.characters die in `Part I' - only one of them generates the kind of pain I expected (and as we see in the novel).  If anything, Yates sacrificed the emotional heart of the story in trying to stay so close to the overriding plot, probably the result of breaking the novel into two parts.  The pay-off will come in `Part II,' so it may all come together fine in the end.  Actually, Yates has a chance to improve on the novel in this final film - Rowling left us hanging a bit with her final few chapters (no Harry/Snape resolution, no Harry/Ginny reunion, no sense of the aftermath of that final battle at Hogwarts).  The `Part II' trailers suggest that Yates may have understood this.  I hope so.    If you love the Potter universe, you've undoubtedly already seen this film.  If you're just curious, watch the other movies first.  And wait until July 14 to watch `Part I' - then you can rush right out and see `Part II' on July 15.  Perhaps together the films will do what `Part I' can't do alone.    One final note - I watched this on a standard DVD on a pretty ordinary and inexpensive TV, and I did not find the scenes excessively dark or difficult to see.  Since so many reviewers mentioned the poor quality of the \\"transfer\\" on the DVD, I'm not sure what this means.  I had no problems.

B004MNO0BQ|5.0|Lots of fun and play well with good speed. Like the choices of board. Always enjoy these types of games.
0312944926|3.0|The book was pretty good, but there was simply too much talk talk talk about computers and computerese.  I would have liked a bit more plot.
B004ZQRJFO|5.0|Anything Em does is solid gold and it is great to see him going back to some of his older style while staying with his new style. This album is the best album of this year and I doubt any other album that comes out this year will touch it. I've said it before and i'll say it again, Eminem is the best rapper ever and will ever be!!! I've been an Em fan since 99 when Slim Shady LP came out and when many ppl gave up on him I was still behind him saying \\"just you watch, my boy is gonna come back\\" and sure enough there he was. He is one of my biggest inspirations!! Eminem is the best rapper there ever is and will ever be PERIOD!!!!
0807014273|5.0|The book I purchased arrived very fast, much sooner than I expected. The package arrived in perfect condition and the book was just as it was described.  I am very pleased with this purchase and will not hesitate to order from this site again in the future.  Great service, great purchase.  Thanks!
B004RKC4PI|4.0|I have all of Aerosmith's albums so when they released this one I just had to buy it. It has all their greatest hits on it if you are looking for an album that has all their greatest hits on it you should buy this album. Another great album that you should try to get you hands on is OH YEAH.
B000069AT7|5.0|I have a rather large DVD collection that contains just about every movie I have ever loved -  the one glaring omission was E.T. - which was ironic since   that movie basically started it all in terms of my love for movies.  I was hoping Spielberg would release a 25th anniversary edition -  when that didn't happen I gave in and bought the rather cheesy   one disk edition of the 2002 release that is in stores now -  I wanted the original movie and packaged in a way that was worthy of one of the best movies of all time -  I had all but given up when I stumbled across this ultimate edition -  it is exactly what I was looking for - just the four disk set would have been enough -  but the book and the strip of the actual film were nice added bonuses -  E.T now has an honored spot on my DVD shelf along with the other great Spielberg movies -  Jaws, Close Encounters, The Indiana Jones movies and Jurassic Park - and my collection is now complete -  Thank you very much Amazon - you made me very happy :)

B0028IDXDS|5.0|I bought this for my infant grandson.  He would only take the pacifier the hospital gave him to comfort him.  In desperation, I found the same pacifier on Amazon.  However, there were animals attached. I've never seen one and it fit perfect with his \\"Jungle\\" theme.  He LOVED it.  The plush toy allowed him pick up his own pacifier with his little uncoordinated hands.  Only problem, I had to buy a second one so we could take away the first one long enough to wash and dry it. A+ product, shipping and cost.  Well worth it.  Thank you.
014241722X|5.0|I bought the book for my Grandson who is eleven years old. Having read almost all previous Grisham books I had to read this before sending it on. This is a wonderful book written for youngsters. A nice story along with a great civics lesson about the workings and procedures of our legal system. Just received the next edition of the series yesterday from AMAZON. These are Great Reading for all both young and old.
B002D0L0R2|5.0|My mom is 68, loves musicals and loves to dance and who doesn't love John Travolta!  I saw this and knew my mom would enjoy it.  For Mothers Day, I packed a gift basket with everything you'd need for the movies and planned a movie date. She loved the movie.  In addition, on the disk are 2-commentaries from the Director and Producers, and 5 Featurettes: Inside the recording booth, It's Hairspray, Playing Tracy, Transform of Travolta to Turnblad and search for Tracy.  Really cute.

B004289ZW0|3.0|The unit works OK.  In my experience it provides only a marginal improvement in GPS signal. The on/off switch is twitchy. It tends to switch on just about any time the unit is picked up. It would be better to simply have a physical switch.

B0034G4ORM|4.0|\\"Battle: Los Angeles\\"(2011) is directed by Jonathan Liebesman (The Killing Room). Aaron Eckhart stars as SSgt. Michael Nantz who helps lead a group of marines against an alien attack. This film is reminiscent of \\"Black Hawk Down\\" but with aliens instead of Somalis for enemies. A sweeping, heroic soundtrack that would have been at home in the film \\"The Last of the Mohicans\\" is often buried beneath the gun fire and explosions. The special effects are great and the action keeps coming. Some of the editing and jittery camera work initially feels choppy, but once the action kicks in all is well and we just hang on and enjoy the ride which is often compelling.<br /><br />This blu-ray has many interesting special features about the making of the film.
B000BFNAYC|2.0|I purchased it to remove paint on concrete. It only shot out a slurry of sand at way too low velocity to remove anything
0525425578|5.0|This is a believable adventure for young Theodore Boone and there are many subtle lessons in compassion and caring in this book. Grisham , as usual, does an excellent job in keeping the reader entertained and interested in the fate of these young people. Anything that makes preteens and teenagers worthy of our interest and respect is such a rarity these days. I found this book a very quick read and such fun.
0670022411|5.0|this book is the best book i have listen to it sgot so much detail and such a good story behind it and explains so much its a book i wish they would make it into a movie i so wold love to see this acted out in a real scene it would be so cool. this book puts so much into detail and it is so vivid i can see it in my mind.
B004L79VUI|4.0|I bought this CD as soon as it came out as I own three other solo efforts by this man. The fact that he's only released five solo albums with them coming like every 10 years is unbelievable because he is incredibly talented. He's able to capture this New Orleans mellow blues style that I haven't heard anywhere else except from maybe The Band (which he was a member of for those of you too young to know). Favorite song is definitely \\"He Don't Live Here No More\\" but a strong contender is \\"The Right Mistake\\" or \\"When the Night Was Young.\\" The latter captures a haunting melody that does take me back to youth but the music sounds like I could hear it on Bourbon Street because it's gotta a crazy, happy undertone to it. Even though I know Robbie sings about the sixties on the track the fact that he's captured a universal melody takes me on the ride. Again, I stress it's a mellow CD but that doesn't take away from the artistic talent alive here within each track. If you're fan of production you'll know what I'm talking about. Check out the title track and a couple of tracks with Clapton; (anyone remember The Last Waltz with \\"Further on Up the Road\\") talk about two guys in synch.<br /><br />Yes, I'm showing a bit of favoritism but it's only because when I put the CD in I find myself going \\"where has this guy been?\\" and \\"if musicians today would take a listen maybe they'd learn everything doesn't have to be a recycled U-2 or Linkin Park guitar bit.\\" The music world is missing this guy and that's a real shame. As for what he's been doing, I know he's been busy. Just ask Marty Scorsese who's asked him to do a few soundtracks and scores, and for those of you needing some information about the lyrics; the man was awarded an award and he co-wrote the Clapton grammy winner \\"My Father's Eyes\\" and the Rod Stewart hit \\"Broken Arrow.\\" The latter is actually one Robbie recorded on his first solo record and it's better than Rod's.<br /><br />Look, I'm heaping praise on the guy because heflies under the radar and I know I sound like I'm kissing ass so take a listen to some of the tracks off your computer before you purchase. All I can say is if you like mellow music touching your soul, with lyrics grabbing you into a scene, and you escape with the music into the presence of a scene in your head then you know he's reaching you.<br /><br />Take a listen and discover.
0374158460|4.0|A few thoughts on this fine novel:     1) Dip into the pages of Freedom and you'll just be swept along by the story, the characters, the observations of modern American life. The writing is effortless. You don't catch Franzen engaging in literary showmanship -- at least I didn't. (Not that I object to literary showoffs -- see Rushdie, Salman.) Franzen's style serves his sprawling story well.    2) Freedom contains some spectacular set pieces and riffs. One that struck a bit close to home for me: a description of Walter Berglund's self-righteous fury at other drivers.    3) Franzen's decision to attach his story to Bush 2-era politics sometimes seemed artificial and not completely thought out. Like at least one other Amazon reviewer, I didn't buy the notion of a 19-year-old University of Virginia student as arms dealer. Even so, Franzen does make some cutting observations of the American political scene circa 2004.    4) For most of the book, Franzen treats his characters with a detached amusement. Every one of them is deeply flawed, and Franzen's dissection can seem condescending and almost heartless (reminding me of the unflinching way the director Alexander Payne sometimes treats his characters). The Berglunds should have been heartbreaking, not just annoying. Then, in the last, I dunno, 50 pages or so, everything seemed to change. These pages are full of, well, love. So much so that...     5) I choked up when I read the final sentence.
0470932139|5.0|I purchased this book simply based on the few images I saw as examples.  I was not at all disappointed. I learned more from the first 10 minutes of reading this book then I had on my own over the last year of blogging.<br />This is a definite must to read, especially if you think your images are not good simply because you need a new camera.  Buy this book and possibly save yourself the expense of a new camera!

B0000DZTIL|5.0|The first time I see it it was on the VHS decades and I was a teenage looking for excitement. Guess what? I got it with this movie. I love everything of this production. The character, the story and the FX. After watching this movie last night I realize that It have a lot of influence from the [[ASIN:B00164GDD2 Ghostbusters [Blu-ray]]] movies. The funny Characters, wonderfully play by the actors and the special effects. I have to say the Fx are incredible, even is 1985. Back in those days, a lot of the lightning, were make manually painted frame by frame and until this day they look awesome. If you like [[ASIN:B00164GDD2 Ghostbusters [Blu-ray]]] you going to love this one.
B004JY0KP8|4.0|I agree with the first reviewer.  The watch is even better looking \\"in person.\\"  It looks and feels like a more expensive watch than it is.  I too find it a bit bigger than I was hoping, but I have small wrists.  It certainly is not a monster.  I have some minor complaints about the band as well.  It is bit stiff, but I hope that its just because its new and will loosen up with time.  The other complaint I have is that the hands are the same color as the face, outlined with silver, but it sometimes causes me to have to look closer at the watch than I might otherwise have to.  They do glow in the dark, however, so that's nice.  Overall I am very pleased with this watch.  Its a very nice looking everyday watch that can be worn for just about any occasion.
B002MRRRAA|5.0|I love this DVD. I watch it over and over and over. The quality is over the top. Audio and Video is great. If you like Nirvana you will love this show! One whole live show from start to finish.
B000062XGB|5.0|I had seen the musical version of this story, both on stage and on film, many times before I saw this version. This version, starring Jodie Foster, is a visual treat.  The scenery and costumes are beautiful, and all of the cast are perfect in their roles.  The king is much more human than in the musical.  Especially touching is his reaction to the death of his favorite child.  I enjoyed this movie so much that I decided to read the actual book written by Anna after her years in Siam.  I learned that this version is the most historically accurate one. I had been waiting for this movie to broadcast on TV but it never seemed to be aired in my area.  When I saw it for sale at a very good price on Amazon, I decided to buy it so I can watch it again.
0847835073|5.0|I remember I missed purchasing this book when it was first released on Amazon. It sold out so quickly. And then afterwards, for the longest time, private sellers was selling this book for triple the cost. Then Amazon restocked it's copies but they only lasted a few days before it sold out again. This happened over the course of a year. I jumped on it this time. I tell you, the wait was worth it. I see why the demand is so high for this book. Its beautiful. Heck, Monica is beautiful. The images are huge, there is enough content to satisfy anyone. If you are like me and missed out on previous opportunities don't miss out again. Right now the book is aback on Amazon and they are offering it for an excellent price. Once it's gone people will be selling it again for some crazy price.
B003TJ4YUQ|5.0|This is an amazing CD/DVD. Music tracks from around the world mixed together to form high quality music. Whats not to love. If we can sing together we can live together - that is what this CD/DVD is promoting. Peace through music, 'Imagine' that!
030746363X|4.0|I saw the hype and the loads of reviews appearing on amazon and wondered if the book was that great, or if it were just an awesome promotion and advertising campaign.  I then thumbed through \\"The 4-Hour Body: An Uncommon Guide To Rapid Fat-Loss, Incredible Sex, and Becoming Superhuman\\" by Timothy Ferriss in the bookstore and ascertained that it did have some information that looked interesting and useful.  However, with the index finishing at page 571, I knew I would not be able to work it into my reading list right away, so I figured I'd wait to purchase it later.  I then sort of put it out of my mind until seeing it on the grab n go shelf at the library.  So I grabbed it, and am glad I did.  It is one I will add to my personal library.  While the entire book is not for everyone, and it is aimed more at men, I think many will find sections of this book quite useful.<br /><br />I really like the concept of the book.  Ferriss used himself to experiment with a variety of concepts related to the human body, or more accurately, his human body.  He believes that by focusing on your body, you will also develop yourself as a whole.  Something I agree with.  You improve your inner game by improving your outer game.  And this book is the result of his experimentation, on himself, to develop his body to the utmost.  One would not do everything in this book simultaneously, and many people won't do everything in this book, I know I wont.  However, for certain areas, the information is worth looking into and following, and I think we all should experiment with ourselves in the quest to become the best we can become.<br /><br />There is an introduction, and then some basics on losing fat.  This might be what most people will want out of this book.  From there, there are additional chapters on fat loss and adding muscle.  These areas are controversial, and that is why there are so many different books proposing various theories and so on.  Ferriss explains how it worked for him and others, and cites the references used, both written and the experts he consulted in person.  (He does this for everything in the book, and that is one thing that impressed me.  The book is well researched and he consulted many outstanding experts in their fields.)<br /><br />Besides the fat losing and muscle building chapters, there are chapters on improving sex (If explicit drawings of female anatomy offend you, you will not like these chapters), perfecting sleep, reversing injuries, running faster and farther, getting stronger, swimming faster and longer, and living a longer and better life.  There are also some interesting things in the appendices and extras, especially the articles on spotting bad science.  There are also numerous supporting videos and related matter at his website.  The book refers to you web pages on his site and others to support or illustrate with video the things he's teaching.  Many of the ideas are not original, and you will find in alternative sources.  Additionally, not all of the suggestions, routines, etc. will work for everyone, nor are they all proven or necessarily safe.  So each reader must use some common sense when reading any book of this type, and never believe one source absolutely for everything.  Ferriss himself says that his research, using only himself, does not meet the criteria of scientific method research and some will slam him for it.  So don't take everything in this book as gospel, and don't believe all the hyped up claims.  Remember, nothing is THAT good.<br /><br />Ferriss writes in an entertaining and conversational style.  It is like you are sitting over a meal and he's explaining what he did to himself, why, and what happened.  (Though from some of the ways he's eaten, I'd want to know what experiments he was engaged in before going to eat.)  It's an enjoyable book, and interesting book, and one that made me think about my own eating, training, and how I keep track of what things are doing to my body, and how I'm advancing in areas.  I'm not going to do everything in this book, but I am going to try some of the exercises and strategies he suggests to see what they do for me.  It's a book I'm glad I finally picked up and read, and I'm looking forward to trying some of the things I learned in it.  I recommend anyone interested in health, fitness, and their body to take a look at it too and use what is useful.<br /><br />Reviewed by Alain Burrese, J.D., author of a number of self-defense DVDs including the Lock On Joint Locking Essentials series.ot going to do everything in this book, but I am going to try some of the exercises and strategies he suggests to see what they do for me.

B004EPYZOO|5.0|After reading Bret Fetzer's poor excuse for a movie review, I was compelled to buy a copy of this film immediately.    No, Bret, it's not Dr. Zhivago.  But a lurid B-movie?  Please.  This is the second film Cage has made that involves the mythology of Hell and the Devil, the first being Ghost Rider.  You have to buy into that hypothesis at the beginning.  It has more cursing, nudity and gory violence than I've ever seen in a Cage film.  It's no family movie.  That said it gets your attention and holds it all the way through.  The acting is mostly grownup and the directing is fair.  It has no drawn-out boring parts.  It is entertainment.  It's not deeply intellectual, it's not good clean fun, and it doesn't have world-class special effects, but it's entertainment.    Worth the price of admission.
B004EPZ07K|2.0|An awful movie, the worst potentially good superhero film since \\"[[ASIN:B001CC7PKS Daredevil]].\\"  The problem stems from an excruciatingly simple script, composed by a quartet of television writers, which is entirely devoid of creativity, the absence of which the writers compensate with gaping plot holes.  The hero of the picture is Hal Jordan (Ryan Reynolds), an arrogant fighter pilot who walks away from everything he cares about because he has daddy issues.  Reynolds doesn't have the power to play a superhero.  He's never seemed so gratingly foolish as when he's trying to do so.  He's like a guy who went to a superhero-themed kegger and started taking himself seriously.  The core fault of this \\"Green Lantern\\" is that I never for a moment believed Hal Jordan could save anyone, let alone the universe.    Blake Lively, on the other hand, is charming and underused, making her transition from \\"[[ASIN:B000W6ZUUC Gossip Girl]]\\" to the big screen.  But God save the scene if she has to act emotional.  The rest of the cast, which includes Peter Sarsgaard as an increasingly deformed scientist, Mark Strong as Sinestro, Jordan's mentor in the comics and his bully in the film, and Temuera Morrison as Abin Sur, the dying alien who grants Jordan his powers.  They're all forgettable, perhaps save for the aforementioned and appropriately named Ms. Lively.    It's only so much their fault.  Besides the trash script, Martin Campbell, who previously directed the Antonio Banderas \\"[[ASIN:B002PQKNRC Zorro]]\\" films and twice revitalized the James Bond series (minorly with 1995's \\"[[ASIN:B000M53GM2 GoldenEye]],\\" with Pierce Brosnan; majorly with \\"[[ASIN:B001DSNF8C Casino Royale]]\\" in 2006, Daniel Craig's debut), has an uninspired directorial style which also produces dull visuals and poorly-constructed scenes--big pitfalls in what should be a flashy film.  The filmmakers are clearly trying to emulate Richard Donner's original \\"[[ASIN:B000K4X5XA Superman]],\\" from 1978--but that was 1978, and this is 2011.  Superhero films have grown by leaps and bounds since then.     This film seems unconscious of that fact, so it also seems derivative and lifeless.  The visual effects are up and down: some are underdeveloped (landscapes, especially on the Green Lanterns' homeplanet, Oa), while others are impressive (Parallax, the demon space entity with an insatiable hunger for fear).  The underappreciated \\"[[ASIN:B0055EAJ7A Thor]]\\" is a better bet as far as superhero movies are concerned.  Better yet, wait for \\"Captain America: The First Avenger,\\" released July 22, which, with a sturdy cast, Joe Johnston's direction, and a script co-written by Joss Whedon, the maverick of creative genre writing, seems likely to be the best superhero movie we've seen since \\"[[ASIN:B0021L8V1Q Iron Man 2]].\\"
B0051BVQFG|5.0|When I choose this movie, my family had mixed reactions at the prospect of watching it. By the end the of movie, even the reluctant viewers were glued to the television. The camera movement is akin to \\"cloverfield\\" in the fact that the shaky camera movement adds to the movie feel and flow. The actors of the marine protagonists are strong and well-chosen for their parts.<br /><br />The few issues that my family pointed out were related to the tactics of the marines not finding cover, and more often then not, staying out in the open while being shot at. This can be atributed to the fact the marines are mostly green with only one \\"old war horse\\" to keep them focused. Another issue that my daughter pointed out was the fact that the aliens attacked Earth for the water. The movie claimed that liquid water can only be found on Earth. Liquid water can also be found on Europa, a moon of Jupiter. The fact the movie guys missed this science fact annoyed my daughter since the premise was \\"Only Earth has liquid water\\" -- not true.<br /><br />As much as can be done in an action flick the characters are developed and the movie draws you in. THis overcomes some triteness and a somewhat formulaic war movie developement. Despite some gaps, this movie is more believable and more entertaining than Independence Day.
0545123275|5.0|Shiver was not only the first wolf book I ever read, it was also the first book that introduced me to this thing called alternating point-of-view. And let me tell you, it was MAGIC!<br /><br />This story has wolves, conflict, hospital visits, bookstores, candy shops (oh! the candy shop! *swoons!*), girl-wolf angst, blood, fur, tears, laughs, kisses, dare I say bedroom visits?! & yes, it takes place in good ole Minnesota! Score 1 for my home state! Shiver honestly has it all!<br /><br />These wolves are unique, they shift based on the weather, not the full moon. Cold = Wolf, Warm = Human. You see how this can be a problem? MinneSNOWta is so cold, we all freeze our nips off until the end of April...no joke. So Sam & Grace's relationship is sort of based off this fact. Sam has to stay warm in order not to shift...so him and Grace might do some.... things to keep warm *wink,wink*! But all jokes aside Maggie creates a world that is intense & frantic it's absolutely impossible not to get caught up in it!<br /><br />I'm just going to throw this out there & feel free to disagree (even though I.am.right!) Shiver has THE BEST ENDING OF ALL TIME. It literally punched me in the gut, not once, but twice. I was so side swiped by the ending I didn't even know it was possible to become so shocked. I am serious. Maggie wrote the ending in such a fantastic way it makes you think one thing....but...that's all I'm going to say. IT. WAS. AWESOME. I still think about that ending all the time!<br /><br />If you like cute boys who shift into a big cuddle-muff of fur when it's cold out, pick this UP!
0439023513|4.0|In \\"Mockingjay,\\" the third in the Hunger Games series by Suzanne Collins, the narrator and protagonist, Katniss Everdeen, age 17, becomes the Mockingjay, the leader of a group of revolutionaries/resistance fighters in this dystopian story world.  The suspense in this novel is good; readers do wonder whether or not the revolutionaries will win their fight for freedom.  There is all that goes with war -- privation, violence -- delivered in a manner for teen readers.  Teen girls will like that Katniss especially is drawn as strong but not without flaws.  Readers are kept in suspense about whether the revolutionaries will win.<br /><br />Granted this is the third book in the series, but the biggest reason I give high 3 to low 4 is because there are readers who do end up picking up in the middle  (or even later) in series books and could use more background than what I found in \\"Mockingjay\\" to catch up and better enjoy this book.  I can recommend \\"Mockingjay\\", but someone who started from the beginning might enjoy it even more than I did.

B000JQU4TW|3.0|This is a review of the Kindle formatting of \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray.\\" I really enjoyed the story itself, but the Kindle layout could really use some work. Like a lot of free public domain ebooks, this one isn't exactly user-friendly. The lack of a title page doesn't bother me, but this book is also missing a table of contents. If you're reading this for a class or a reading group, that missing table of contents might be a deal breaker. Additionally, while you can always refer to line numbers, this book lacks pagination. Again: I realize this isn't something that's going to bother everyone, but if you need to refer to page numbers in an essay, you might be in trouble if you use this copy.<br /><br />If you're like me and you're interested in reading this book just for fun, page numbers and a table of contents probably don't matter much to you. However, I think everyone can agree that things like page breaks and proper spacing between chapters vastly improve one's reading experience. That's the real rub: There are none. Paragraphs sit immediately atop one another like a great wall of text. Chapters receive the same treatment and are only demarcated by plain text- no bolding, no new section, nothing. The whole effect is not only visually unappealing, but just plain annoying.<br /><br />So the layout of this Kindle edition isn't great, but this book isn't all bad. For one thing, it's free. You get what you pay for formatting-wise, but it's a fantastic story and it's yours forever at absolutely no cost. Plus- and this is also big- this ebook isn't riddled with spelling errors and typos like a lot of the other public domain books available on the Kindle. In sum, while the formatting is annoying, the book is still totally readable.
B001GKYBXA|5.0|Modern. Unpredictable. Melodic. Beautiful. Challenging. Extraordinary.<br /><br />There are wonderful flourishes of electronica followed by moments that can only be called Beatlesque. Is it Paul's best? Yes or no, this is an album that will surely stand the test of time--leaving some to scratch their heads while others race to share it with their friends.<br /><br />Me? I haven't liked something this much in a long, long time.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|I already knew the content was excellent from watching the series, but I was extremely pleased with the speed of the delivery. The series was purchased as a gift, and it gives great peace of mind to have it in My possession well ahead of the special birthday!
0061726826|5.0|This book was so lyrically & poetically written that sometimes I wanted to cry(maybe it was just that time of the month) but some of the descriptions were absolutely breathtaking.<br /><br />If I'm going to be completely honest the first 200 pages (exactly) we really slow for me. It wasn't that it was bad or I didn't like it, it was just slow. But as soon as I hit page 200 vrrooommm! It shot off like crazy, so much action, and dialogue and tension and kissing! Eeep! (I like kissies!!)<br /><br />The plot/dystopian society in itself was the most amazing concept ever. How weird to think that love is a disease you need to be cured from? Even the word love was a no-no, which was just so crazy for me because I whip the word love around more than willow whips her hair back and forth!<br /><br />The characters were fantastic! I adored Lena, she was strong and the most selfless character i have ever read about. I really liked that she was a teenage girl who saw her flaws. Not many girls admit to being a \\"stale cookie\\". I thought she was just an amazing heroine and you know what!? She deserves to be happy!<br /><br />Do NOT even get me started on Alex! I loved him from the very beginning! He is the perfectest & sweetest guy ever! As I was reading I kept thinking \\"when is Alex gunna pop back up!?\\" He and Lena were so cute I could not even stand it! It was kind of like watching a bunny eat cotton candy... adorbs right!? I thought their relationship developed so naturally and it made it believable. Alex is so upfront and honest and caring and I want him! Yesterday!<br /><br />Oh-my-goodness gracious the last chapter had me sweating (literally it was really hot in the dorm) holy crap the ending. *mouth drops* I can't believe that's how it ended and that's all I am saying... ALEX *cries* *hugs self* *cries some more* Alex?<br /><br />I can't wait for the next installment in the series!! Lauren Oliver is an incredible writer!<br /><br />Don't give up on this book, keep trucking through if you feel like stopping, because you wont be disappointed!appointed!
B0046W1692|5.0|Mana kept us waiting for a few years for this one, but it was worth the wait! The sound is fantastic and the lyrics poetic. Thank you, Mana, for sharing your music with the world.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I just finished the last book and was totally disappointed. I felt as though the author lost her momentum.   In the first two books I was captivated by her writing, in this one, I felt like someone else had taken over and I was reading a different story by a different author.  I wanted more of the same but this one just took too many turns and I didn't feel as deep of a connection with any of the characters. I wanted more about Gale and Peeta and their relationship with Katniss. I thought I might get to know Gale more in this one, but he was all over the place and I felt as though his character was never developed in full.   The ending seemed so sudden and totally took a nose dive.   Instead of hanging onto every word, I wanted it to be over and felt bored at times.   Sad because the first two books were fabulous!
B000WJSCZE|5.0|This excellent book clearly outlines specific techniqies to make your presentations effective, and more than just flashy slide-shows. Although this topic might sound dull, Reynolds makes this journey both interesting and understanding. This book has quite literally changed the way that I present, and very much for the better.
B0051BVQFG|5.0|There's plenty of bad reviews for this film, from \\"professional critics\\" and actual people alike. For the former, if you have any experience you already know where to shove those. For the latter, it's more interesting.    If you look at most bad reviews, it's clear that people are panning the movie for being a very archetypal war action movie. Yes, it doesn't have much character development. Yes, it doesn't have a twisty plot or any particular surprises - the storyline is rather predictable. Yes, there's not all that much dialog, and a lot of action.    But, hello, guys? It's a WAR ACTION MOVIE! It's meant to be about shooting and blowing stuff up, spiced up with a bit of soldier camaraderie, self-sacrifice, and \\"Now we're so mad we're gonna kick those guys ass! Hoorah!\\" attitude - NOT about storyline or emotional development of characters or delivering some deep and thoughtful insight. If you don't like the genre, then why bother viewing it? You're not going to like it, precisely for the things that make it distinct. I hate sitcoms, but I don't go reviewing them telling how they such because of the stupid laughter behind the screen etc. It's just not constructive.    Now if you look at this from the perspective of its genre, then it's practically a classic - all the cliches and stereotypes of the genre are here in droves. If you enjoy that kind of thing, you won't be disappointed at all - it's a solid hour and a half of gritty action. Acting is good, camera work is good, and special effects are not overwhelming, but what's there is well done.    By the way - yes, for those who game, the movie does feel a fair bit like modern casual war games (like Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, or perhaps more like Operation Flashpoint: Red River, if I was asked to pinpoint the closest living relative). That's no surprise, because that gaming genre arose from war action movie genre, and shares a lot in common with it. Nothing bad about it.
B00003CXXP|5.0|I will be honest here. When I heard about this movie ten years ago and rediscovered it recently I really wanted to not watch it at all since it was a \\"Speilberg\\" film and you know how sentimental and stuff his movies can be (despite having seen and enjoyed many of his movies including \\"E.T.\\" and \\"War of the Worlds\\"). However since movies about robots, more specifically \\"human\\" robots greatly interest me and also seeing previews of the film with Haley Joel Osment's incredibly convincing acting as David and his lovable companion Teddy I knew I had to see this film.     I really believed Haley was the robot David who just wanted to be loved by his mother. I felt his pain, joy, and loneliness. Stanley Kubrick originally did not think a child actor would be able to portray David but in my opinion Haley did the role justice. I could not see anyone else bringing Teddy to life as Jack Angel did. He really made Teddy feels like a loyal guardian type who wasn't afraid to be stern with you but would always be there to comfort you at the same time. I also felt Jude Law was convincing as Joe.     **POSSIBLE SPOILER**    I wish more imagination had been put into the mecha towards the end of the film. I was not impressed by their appearance but this did not hinder my enjoyment of the film.    I recommend anyone who loves Speilberg films, sentimental films that tug at your heartstrings,  or  just loves robot/sci-fi films (especially with \\"human\\" robots) to rent or purchase this film.
0802798225|5.0|So Perfect Chemistry was... PERFECT! It was super good! Witty banter, sexual tension... Chemistry everything I love in my books!<br /><br />I think ulternating POV is heaven, YOU get the best of both worlds!  I finished the beast in one night it was too good. So fast paced, I did not want to set it down.<br />Brittany is surprisingly likeable. She puts on an act that everything in her life is perfect when she is actually miserable. The scenes with her sister were heart breaking at times, if you know what its like to live with a handicapped person. Alex just has the intention of winning \\"the bet\\" but when he starts to fall for Brittany it just too cute! Of course the poop hits the fan and she find out, and then I was all like \\"ALEX YOU IDIOIT! WHY DID YOU SAY THAT?\\" I was so mad towards the end. I think I almost cried. You need to read this book. It will not dissapoint. I want to read Rules of Attraction just for the mentions of Alex and Brittany being happy!

B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this second part of the trilogy as much as the first. Again, you are immediately caught up in the story until the very last page.<br />I enjoyed the author's writing so much...it's as if she is telling you the story by a campfire and you have to listen to each and every word.  Not many books I don't find myself skimming over parts, but so far in both novels, I've been enraptured and totally engrossed, not wanting to miss a word.<br />Great imaginative story!
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|The  cd arrived in quick time and was exactly the product that I ordered.  It sounded great and I was pleased with my purchase.
B0054IOWTS|2.0|Where to start? As a real rebreather diver, I thought, how bad can it be? WOW. I agree, the first shot of the cave hole was cool. So was the tank from WW2. So how about that boulder that sat there for eons, just to plug the hole when they needed to get out? You just got to love that ending, where did that come from? The real thing is happening right now, TED did a cover on it. Script, where did it go?
0783231032|1.0|1941 itself is an entertaining movie, and I have always enjoyed it thoroughly.  I was quite shocked to buy the disc and find that first and foremost it is not enhanced for widescreen TVs, so you have to zoom to view it in the proper aspect ratio, thus distorting the resolution.  Secondly, the colors on this print are very blurred.  It was originally slapped onto DVD at the end of the '90s, well before the concept of cleaning prints and removing dust and fecks was common practice.  In short, it still has not received this treatment and desperately needs it.  Good movie, bad disc, a pity.
B004SBQTHU|3.0|liked many of their full albums....     however (comma) i was not a fan of this one

B0026RHR6K|5.0|BSG is one of the best sci-fi series I've ever watched.  The story, the characters, and the acting are superb.  There's nothing about this series that isn't great.  It will keep you entertained a short time--I say short because you're going to want to watch five or six episodes at a time.
0439023521|4.0|I really liked this book, it was hard to put down.    It is set in the future, and is about the future and the way the government instills fear in the population is to make the kids fight a reality show where they have to kill each other \\"the hunger games\\".    I loved Katniss - she was a fighter. Since her mother checked out on her when her father died, she had to grow up and support the family by turning into a hunter - skills that definitely came in handy for the entire book and ( obviously ) enabled her to survive.    I couldn't quite get into Gale as much, not sure why ( it might have to do with the fact that there was this guy named that in high shool that I absolutely HATED...:) ), but I'm hoping he grows on me in the next book that I haven't read yet. :) He is just not quite as interesting to me.    Books are very hard to review for other people, what makes one person love them another one hates... so, sorry if I've offended any Gale fans out there... ;)    Definitely worth the price of the first book. I'm just hesitating a bit on the next ones since they cost a lot more.
B002JVWQSW|2.0|The first disc did not work properly. It skipped and looked like there was something wrong with it even though it was new.
0316067938|5.0|I don't understand why people are saying this book is awful. I found this to be the best of the four. It was great! I couldn't put it down. Can't wait to see what they do with the movie. I'm glad it will be 2 movies. There's so much to digest that one movie couldn't have done it justice. Don't listen to the critics. Read it yourself. I don't think you will be disappointed. I hope Stephenie writes another one about these vampires. I would buy it in a mili-second.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The hunger games is the best book i've read in years.  It takes you along with katniss as she fights for survival in place of her little sister and struggles to understand her own feelings for her best friend and new found love interest. Suzanne Collins writes so well you feel every emotion katniss feels and find yourself rooting for Katniss and Peeta. It also makes you think about what would happen in our country if the things that happened in the book happened to us. Would we become as sadistic as the capital is?
B004LZRRRE|5.0|I understand from some fans that a couple of songs were missing from this, but they did a bang on job with what you do get.  Of all the concerts i've seen of them, Morten made the best effort on this one.  His voice sounds really great and they all seem to be having some bitter sweet fun.  Worth every penney.

1416955070|4.0|I quite liked this book. I read a lot, and so does my preteen son, but he's got really good taste, so I borrowed the book from him. It was a quick read for me, and it's not deep, but it was fun, and I appreciated that it was well-written, unlike some other things I've read. I'd read the Faerie series that Cassandra Clare wrote and enjoyed it as well, though this plotline seemed a little more derivative. I will say that I didn't find it as improbable as some of the Harry Potter books, and the storyline was more engaging for me. The characters also felt well-written, if a bit shallow. Overall, I liked it better than Harry Potter. It was entertaining and I enjoyed it, and I'm reading the second book in the series.
B00005214X|5.0|When I want \\"new\\" music I start searching youtube and my memory for stuff I haven't heard in a long time and/or always heard was good but didn't own when I was younger.

0743454537|5.0|My Sister's Keeper is Jodi Picoult's 11th novel. It centres around Anna Fitzgerald who has retained lawyer Campbell Alexander to sue her parents for the right to her own body. Anna was conceived to provide (initially) cord blood for her older sister Kate who has leukaemia. As she has grown up and as Kate's disease has progressed, more and more has been demanded of Anna's body for her sister. The story of what happens is told in several voices: Anna's, her mother Sara's, her brother Jesse's, her father Brian's, her lawyer Campbell's, and her guardian ad litem, Julia's. this is a provocative novel that does not shy away from the issues: conceiving a child to save another; who has rights over a minor's body; is it possible to love a child too much; is it possible to love all one's children equally; teenage pyromania. As always, Picoult handles the court scenes with finesse, and the final twist makes for a perfect ending. A great read!
0307716511|5.0|This is a MUST READ. Not one boring moment in 318 pages. Amazing that this is a first novel. Rosamund Lupton is a master writer and in this, her first novel, it isn't only the story but the ending. Wow. Reading for many hours, all I can say is wonderful, excellent, a great escape, a great read, a marvelous literary mystery. Vivid and the pacing is pitch perfect. I am so glad I bought this and read it and having a sad day, I was not sad at all being in the world of \\"Sister\\" but ecstatic.<br /><br />I'd put this in the league of PD James and Batya Gur. To me, a masterpiece. There are only two things that I would quibble with, and they would be spoilers but you'll feel it as well, as it comes in the last pages. Which are wonderful and in one instance a little sad. But basically: Just beautiful. FIVE BIG STARS.
B001AIRUOU|5.0|Love this movie!  Fantastic price for the collectors set! Movie arrived in less than a week, well packed and not a scratch on it. I've bought more movies since from Amazon.....so far have had great luck with all of them!
B0009FTXGI|4.0|I bought this lens hood to put on my [[ASIN:B0002Y5WXE Canon EF-S 10-22mm f/3.5-4.5 USM SLR Lens for EOS Digital SLRs]].  It fits on there okay.  The fit on the lens isn't especially impressive, but I can't see any reason why it would be less effective at blocking stray light than the Canon branded hood.  The one thing that it likely loses to the Canon hood on is build quality (to be expected) and the likelihood of it being able to protect your lens as well if you were to drop it accidentally or get hit by an object with it mounted.  Although it would be nicer to have that added confidence, most of us aren't likely to drop our camera/lens/hood, although your likelihood of getting into a situation where an object might hit you/your camera setup will vary.  Even if you did drop it or get hit with an object, my guess is that this hood should still stand a decent chance of protecting your lens, but if this is a concern for you, get the Canon-branded version for peace of mind.    I primarily bought this hood for the purpose of protecting it from stray beams of light, and improving my image quality in daylight, and for those purposes, it does its job very effectively at a worthwhile cost-savings over its branded counterpart.  I can't say I'm \\"thrilled\\" with it, but it's like that old saying, \\"close enough for government work\\".  :)
B004H4HRX8|5.0|The Distant Hours is Australian author, Kate Morton's third novel. The novel plays out over two time periods: the early 1940s and 50 years later. The story begins when Meredith Burchill receives a letter that has been delayed by 50 years. The letter is from one of the Blythe sisters of Milderhurst Castle in Kent, to where Meredith was evacuated from London during the war. Her daughter Edith watches her reaction and is inwardly sceptical when her mother dismisses the letter as unimportant. Sometime later, Edith's publishing job takes her near Milderhurst Castle, where she is drawn to know more about the place her mother stayed, the place that was also home to the famous author, Raymond Blythe. She meets the elderly sisters Blythe: the twins, Persephone (Percy) and Seraphina (Saffy) and the much younger (and mad) Juniper (June), during a tour of the Castle. Whilst there, she hears something of the events of 50 years previous that have left Juniper stuck on October 29th, 1941. Juniper still waits for the expected fiancé who never arrived. This book is filled with wonderful prose (\\"And then had come the rain, great sobbing drops that brought an immediate sheen to the world.\\" and \\"The room bore an unmistakeable signature of stillness\\"). The characters develop well: Morton binds the sisters in an intricate tangle of love and duty and resentment. The plot is involved and interesting enough to keep the reader turning pages. By about a third of the way through I was convinced I had figured out who dunnit, as I think many readers will be. It was such a lovely read, though, that I kept going and was duly surprised by the twist at the end. The epilogue was a superb touch. A very enjoyable read.
0345472322|5.0|I read a large number of books with information that is worth knowing. The difference with Carol Dweck's Mindset is that just reading this book will change your life, and your world, for the better. I mean it: results are instantaneous. You will learn a lot about other people and some things about yourself, and you will become better for it. As you continue to apply your knowledge, you will help other people act in more constructive ways for themselves. Simple concept, but life enhancing results. I urge you to spend a few hours with this well-written book.    The intellectual concept is easy to grasp very early in the book, and some will say, \\"That's all I need to know.\\"  In honesty, I do that too with many books because I do not have enough time to read all of the books I want to know about; I have a point of reference that I can return to as needed.  But I stuck with this book, and I am glad I did.  It's not a difficult read, and by staying engaged longer, I became aware of some wrinkles in myself that were not immediately obvious.  I have work to do, and I would not have known that if I stopped early. I also built up my emotional mote (levee?) around the concepts that I quickly agreed with intellectually.  I suggest reading the whole book:  It will not take long, you'll have some laughs, you will most likely gain some immediately applicable techniques to use, and you'll strengthen your emotional commitment to the ideas you have already committed to intellectually.
0061997811|5.0|I just received the book today and have only skimmed the contents, but this book is simply astounding!  Every imaginable paper artifact from the HP story is here to hold in your hands - Quidditch tickets, wanted posters, maps, Yule Ball program, etc., etc.  Even without all of these wonderful inserts, the book would be worth many times its modest price, just for the wealth of fascinating details and photos about every aspect of the HP story and film series.  The quality of the presentation and sheer volume of information they managed to squeeze in is difficult to describe; you just have to see it.  If you love Harry Potter (especially on the big screen) or know anyone who does, stop reading now and buy this book!

B004WCTLNY|4.0|Though this film is not fantastic - it certainly is entertaining and incredibly real in it's explanation of our daily lives and the decisions we make.    If you have you any sense of spirituality, existentialism, fate or the ability to understand what 'analogies' are, then you'll understand this film.    The 'Adjustment Bureau' are actually the 'Unseen' and 'Unknown' forces that make each individual 'make'   and 'create' our decisions, or prevent us from doing certain things, or presenting opportunities.    Exactly like the film - missing a bus, or failing to get the girl's number - are all adjustments for a reason.    I first thought the 'agents' running through the doors was crazy - but again a simple analogy... Unseen forces can appear anywhere at anytime... Get it??    It also helps your understanding, to know your life is guided to a certain extent. Options are presented and you have choices... anything else getting in between you and your choices, are adjustments...    Hope I cleared this up :] - Lemme know your thought's otherwise.    Cheers,  Sebastian
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|I love this movie. I just knew I had to buy it after I saw it. The scenery is beautiful, with the crystal clear water, gorgeous skies and EVERYTHING. I love Bethany Hamilton she is such a Godly woman. She came home from the hospital trying to live life as normally as possible. She didn't sulk around having everyone wait on her hand and foot. I also love how she reminded her brother that they need to give thanks before they eat. If anyone could've forgotten to be thankful it could've very easily been her. She has such a lovely spirit and such determination. I love how she was still willing to compete and do her best. The scenes with her training were so awesome. I can't even do push ups with 2 arms! She has such a blessed life and God certainly is using her. I love this movie. I also love how she went to help out in Thailand and encouraged the little boy to get into the water. I also love how she didn't even get sad when the boy poked the stub of her missing arm. She just laughed and said \\"Something's missing huh?\\" She has an amazing drive. She didn't let her situation stop her from helping others or doing what she loves most. I think this movie is a must see =) It goes to show you how God can use the worst situations and turn them into something beautiful and bring glory to himself
B001U887XS|5.0|I had bought a pair of Mammoth Crocs for my dad before... he loved them.

B00544L9EI|5.0|I was very excited to get this CD in the mail. I was not let down. I have been an Eminem fan since The Slim Shady LP. I really like Recovery, but like other Eminem fans, didn't think it was as hard as he usually goes. It did have a lot of \\"fluff\\" The Marshall Mathers is by far my favorite CD. Hell: The Sequel reminds me of the reasons I love Eminem, and also reminds me of the Marshall Mathers CD. Royce is also amazing as well. They sound great together! It is a very raw album with just a little fluff(bruno mars). It sounds more like a real hip-hop album!

B000SXMSUO|3.0|As with so many other rabid Enigma fans, I anxiously awaited this record's release. I've followed Enigma from the very beginning and every record Cretu has unleashed on the world has charged my soul and changed me in a pretty significant way.  I heard some of the sound clips from \\"Voyageur\\" prior to its release, and generally liked what I heard. But when I finally got the CD and listened to it start to finish, I was left feeling a little deflated. From all the tidbits we gathered before the release of \\"Voyageur\\", Cretu himself said that the old familiar sound of Enigma was a thing of the past, and that the new album would be something different entirely. I don't think many of us were prepared for just HOW different it would be.     I'm a huge proponent of artists evolving their sound and keeping things fresh- that's how the most successful musicians of all time have managed to sustain their popularity, but I also believe the change needs to be very carefully calculated, especially when it's out of left field like this CD.  \\"Voyageur\\" is a bit of a shock to the ears upon its first listen, especially when we've all kind of settled into an expectation of the Enigma sound over the first four albums.     Now, I will say that \\"Voyageur\\" has some great elements to it, and there is still most certainly Enigma present in a lot of these songs, however, it's hard to say whether the good outweighs the bad. \\"Voyageur\\" is unfortunately a pretty disjointed recording. The styles are all over the map, and unfortunately songs like \\"Look of Today\\", \\"Incognito\\", and \\"Weightless\\" are somewhere out in the middle of nowhere, and aren't cohesive at all. In the past, Enigma has been very much about concept albums, and overall, this one hasn't strayed from that formula, but a lot of it feels like musical \\"leftovers\\" that were just kind of polished up and thrown in the mix without much thought to whether they belonged. Even the best tracks on here \\"From East to West\\" (my favorite from this CD), \\"Voyageur\\", \\"In The Shadow, In The Light\\", and \\"Page of Cups\\" aren't quite up to snuff in terms of sound quality and originality, especially when compared to previous albums like \\"Le Roi Est Mort, Vive Le Roi!\\".     So while I'm still of the mind that Cretu is a genius, even geniuses can't win 'em all. Over the course of a twenty-year-and-counting career with Enigma, there's bound to be some stinkers in the bunch. Don't get me wrong, I still like many of the elements on this album, but it pales in comparison to most of the other Enigma records.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|Bought the flash based upon the 100's of reviews saying I needed it:)  I am a newbie to DSLR and own a Nikon D3100 which I'm loving.  Indoor pictures with the built in flash were nice but certainly left a lot to be desired.  I just got the flash a couple of days ago and when I opened the box I though \\"that's it!\\"  I guess I had imagined something with a little more substance and weight.  No big deal though.  It is almost unnoticeable on the camera and does it's job well.  I took several pics with it compared to the built in flash.  Big difference!  Aiming it at the ceiling made my pics look like they were taken in a window filled room in the middle of the day rather than in a dark room with a flash...  I'm excited about the impact this flash will have on my pictures!!!
0142418218|5.0|Like more than one reviewer of this book, I was in Third Grade when I read it, and it was the first book with over 100 pages that I recall completing on my own.I talked about it incessantly as I did so, and may have driven more than one acquaintance crazy with that.   I was galavanized by having seen the movie on NBC some time earlier, in the days when such airings were more sporadic, and also by a rather cheap staged version by other school mates in which Veruca Salt whirled out of the classroom to a recording of \\"I Want It Now\\".   The story of Charlie Bucket's virtue being rewarded is an archaic theme, presented to us by the late Roald Dahl whose style is emulated by J.K. Rowling in many ways.   The young newspaper boy lives in a two-room shack by a prestigious and mysterious chocolate factory with his parents and four bed-ridden grandparents.   His Grandpa Joe tells him the story of the candy factory's owner, Willie Wonka, whose factory was closed for many years due to spies trying to steal his candy-making secrets, until one day smoke mysteriously appears from the smoke stacks after years of inactivity. No one knows how the factory is run since no one is seen going in or out.    One day, Mr. Wonka stages a contest in which he promises children who find special golden tickets beneath the wrapping of any of his candy bars a tour of his factory, whipping the whole world into a ticket-finding frenzy.     The first to find one is Augustus Gloop, the personification of gluttony, whose parents overindulge his consumption of junk food.     The next is the ultimate spoiled rich girl, Veruca Salt, whose father runs a nut factory, and who, to quiet his hollering daughter, makes his workers \\"shell\\" Wonka bars until one is located.     The third is the curly haired gum-chewing champion, Violet Beauregarde, who switched from gum to candy bars in order to find a ticket.     The fourth is Mike Teevee, who dressed as a cowboy, shoots his pistols before his television set all daylong.No explanation of how he found a ticket is given.     Amid the discovery that an early find was a fake, and the worsening situation for Charlie's family, Charlie finds a stray dollar in the street, buys a Wonka candy bar, and finds the last ticket. His family fortunes will change forever.    Grandpa Joe, bedridden for over twenty years finally gets out of bed to accompany Charlie on the tour on that fine snowy day.   Amid much fan fare, the ticket holders and at least one accompanying adult are greeted by the diminutive Mr. Wonka the very next day. They enter the factory, and begin a magical, mystical adventure, enjoying a few sweet treats along the way.   But alas children will be defeated by their own personal vices, and the best one can hope for is that they will eventually be wiser for the ware.The Ooompa-Loompas, described in the book as little Cro-Magnon types with rosy skin, long-golden brown hair, bearded, mustachioed, and with beautiful sets of teeth, break into a little morality song every time a child is eliminated from the tour for bad behavior.   Having seen both of the film versions, I have often wished that one could be done that's truer to Dahl's story, although both featured some elements of it.     In the final analysis, this adventure is still a delightful one of which I have fond memories,and of which generations more will too.

B0034G4ORC|1.0|OMG!  This is the absolute worst movie I have EVER purchased.  Don't waste your money - wait for it to come on the sci-fi station - during \\"Z\\" flick week.<br /><br />Did Hollywood completely run out of talent?  It's not the graphics that are lacking in this really bad film...those are not bad but they are entirely wasted on this film (you can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear).  The \\"story\\" is old..aliens come down to wipe us out.  However, it's a story that can be made entertaining with the right characters and plot.  This film lacks BOTH.<br /><br />I rarely commment on movies - however, this one is so incredibly bad - I felt it my duty to warn those that might be considering parting with the 16 bucks for this movie - save your money!!!!
6304696515|5.0|At first glance the story of this movie looks like something much too inane to base anything substantial on it. It revolves entirely around seduction and gossip, thus being more suitable to a teenage comedy rather than to a historical drama set in France from the XVIII century. (Indeed, later it did become a teen comedy: [[ASIN:B00001PE4D Cruel Intentions]]; but that's another story). Yet the movie is an absolute classic that cannot be recommended highly enough to anybody who still cares for great acting and deep meaning on the screen.    The reasons for the undisputed, if a bit neglected, classical status of this movie are chiefly two: 1) the screenplay is much more than mere sexual intrigues; and 2) the cast is downright outstanding, especially the leading parts.    To begin with, the screenplay in the beginning is far from promising, busying itself - and yourself too - with petty games of people who have much too much time on their hands. Yet somewhere in the middle you start having some kind of foreboding. It is well justified. For the movie develops from an innocent social comedy into a dark drama of frightening intensity. This is no period piece, that's for sure. The main theme of the movie is the complex relationship between lust and love, a conundrum as relevant today as it ever was - or ever will be. For all their cunning duplicity and social hypocrisy, both Vicomte de Valmont and Marquise de Merteuil, deep inside themselves, long for the same thing as more or less anybody, then and now: love, affection, companionship. Both the Vicomte and the Marquise have far too intelligent and sophisticated minds as not to realize that passion and lust neither last nor bring lasting satisfaction.    Even though the supporting cast includes fine performances by Michelle Pfeiffer, Uma Turman, Keanu Reeves and Swoosie Kurtz, all these worthies are completely overshadowed by Glenn Close and John Malkovich in the parts of the Marquiese and the Vicomte, respectively. Neither of them may at first strike you as the right choice for a great seducer, of either sex, but both of them (considerably helped by the great script and genius for acting) make terrific roles and remind me that the secret of seduction is in the provocative behaviour, not in the gorgeous looks. The scenes between them are unforgettable, full of double entendres and refreshing frankness delivered with the most deliciously elaborate eighteenth-century vocabulary. No less suave are the innuendos they devise and carry out with the destinies of the other characters. Yet one is never in any doubt that behind the glittering façade there are ruthless calculation and genuine malice quite devoid of any scruples whatsoever. Significantly, both have ''solo scenes'' in the very end of the movie - the duel (with a great dying speech by John Malkovich) and the public ostracizing (deeply affecting performance by Glenn Close without a single word) - and these are among the most affecting moments in the whole movie.     For my part, I did not in the least find the main characters too cold or impossible to sympathize with, as other reviewers apparently did. Quite to the contrary: the icy coldness, which is of course essential for their characters, was finely balanced by sorrows and torments common to all of us. In the end, for all their appalling selfishness, I was sorry for Marquiese who lived to see her whole world destroyed beyond repair, and I definitely found the Vicomte very likeable, even compelling, especially considering his longing for something had never experienced: a true love, an union of souls and bodies entirely devoid of any self-interest.    In conclusion, this is superb movie exploring the eternal war between the flesh and the spirit; if anything, it is MORE relevant today, in our supposedly free thinking but actually abominably loose times, than it was few centuries ago. In addition to great script and some of the finest dialogue ever written for the screen, the movie boasts sumptuous historical sets and costumes, very nice soundtrack, the right dose of high comedy and, above all, stunning acting, particularly by Glenn Close and John Malkovich in the leading roles but also by Michelle Pfeiffer in the most important supporting one. Nobody who cares about cinema as a form of art should miss this movie. It rewards a re-watching also.    P. S. It goes without saying that this movie is on a significantly higher plane than ''Cruel Intentions'', but this is no reason to degrade the latter. It is made as a teen comedy by design and it is a very clever adaptation of a story which was originally much more like a film noir, rather than a comedy. Besides, ''Cruel Intentions'' does not in the least lack some substance, though admittedly of a lighter kind than the one in ''Dangerous Liaisons''.
0385335997|1.0|I don't even know where to start with this book. First off I have read the other two books that preceeded this one. I liked Outlander, although there were moments where I was bored, and DIA was just one giant flashback. However this book had me flipping back to see what I miss because I was sorely lost. There was just so much going on in regards to the plot of the story and I was surprised to discover I was beginning to hate Claire and Jamie.<br /><br />Okay so who doesn't love some drama and excitement in their lives (or at least their novels) but Ms. Gabaldon, come on! This book was full of ridiculous nonsense. A break out of typhoid, Jamie somehow becoming a leader of a group of pirates (that one's never explained), a one armed black man that gets... ahmen relieved in public? WHAT AM I READING? The sheer amount of drama that goes on in this can induce migraines.<br /><br />I was also really upset at the characters in this book. First off I know it's 20 years later and Jamie's had a lot of crap to deal with in his life, losing Claire, Culloden, Prison (again), becoming a stud, having a child with a girl he didn't want to sleep with, and the list goes on. However that's no reason for him not being truthful to Claire when she does show up. Also... what?! Why would he do any of this crap? He's suffered the consequences before with no problem. I know he's helping his family and keeping them safe but what are the chances of all of this happening to one man and he has no control over any of it? Another problem with Jamie... he must be a real stud. I mean there are people crawling out of everywhere to have sex with him. Random men, girls, everyone is making a pass at him... I just don't understand it! And on top of everything, Claire, who HAD a backbone in Outlander, accepts everything he's done like it's no problem. It's disgusting.<br /><br />As you can clearly see I did not like this at all. I usually devour novels within days however this one took me 6 months to complete. I sincerely hope that in the future the novels get better (unlikely because they're just as long). However for me I'm stopping here. I want to throw the book across the room and never look at it again. 1100 pages, too long and very unnecessary.the future the novels get better (unlikely because they're just as long).

B0052UZIFA|3.0|This game is great, could use the puzzle modes. I would give it 5 stars if it had the puzzle modes.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|Almost everything about that movie is mediocre. Oliver Stone's screenplay is the ordinary, even trivial, story of the American Dream from a gangster's point of view: from a destitute Cuban emigrant to the most powerful mafia boss on the East Coast, if not the whole country. There are some really memorable lines but they are usually diluted with a good deal of foul language. Brian de Palma does have occasional shots that are singularly illuminating, even haunting, but on the whole he is the most overrated director after Tarantino and Scorcese. Giorgio Moroder's soundtrack is a cheesy semi-trash. The supporting cast is reliable and serviceable enough, but none of the players - and these include Michelle Pfeiffer, Robert Loggia, Steven Bauer, and Mary Elisabeth Mastrantonio - has much chance of making anything memorable.    If this movie is a classic - and classic it certainly is - this is solely because of Al Pacino, one of the last actors in possession of genius and charisma prodigious enough to make a whole movie (and a long one) well worth watching for generations ahead. If the brash, bumptious, having tons of ''balls'' Tony Montana has become one of the most iconic characters when it comes to mafia bosses, this is entirely due to Al Pacino's incredibly vivid portrayal of every detail from his make-up: from the Spanish accent all the way to the violent temper. It is incredible that this is the same man who has played the title role in ''The Godfather'', yet it happens to be true. For the cold, extremely sophisticated and highly intelligent Michael Corleone is the very antithesis of Tony Montana who is shrewd and clever, rather than intelligent and sophisticated, and flies into passion at the smallest provocation. Having created these two extremely different faces of the same coin, it is safe to say to say that Al Pacino has done everything there is to be done as far as mafia bosses on the screen are concerned. (Of course ''The Godfather'' is infinitely superior inevery other aspect than ''Scarface'', but this is not the point here.)    In addition to completely overshadowing a decent, if far from brilliant, supporting cast, the explosive Tony Montana is also the only character in which there is some sort of deeper meaning than the small talk that occupies 95% of the screenplay. There are, indeed, some lines of his (such as those from the embarrassing scene in the restaurant: ''You need people like me so you can point your [*Amazon censorship!*] fingers and say, \\"That's the bad guy.\\" So... what that make you? Good? You're not good. You just know how to hide, how to lie.'') which are almost too smart to be entirely in character. Nevertheless, one is bound to ask: why does Tony Montana fail? And fail he does, in a most pathetic way: after the world almost literally was his, he ended up with more lead in his body than it was used in the Gulf War. (Compare this with the aged Michael Corleone dying peacefully in the yard of his Sicilian house.) The more simplistic explanation is probably the truer one: Tony is victim of his own temperament which knows no restraint. Perhaps, for all his cleverness, there also is some essential lack of astuteness in Tony; even though he ''knows the street'' and ''makes the right connections'' he entirely fails to grasp that Alejandro Sosa is not somebody to screw up your business with. In a way, Tony Montana is a curiously inspiring figure, suggesting that you can achieve everything in this life if you have the character (or the ''balls'', to use his language). And yes, it is dead true that most simple don't have the guts to be what they want to be and have to satisfy themselves with third-rate lives rife with hypocrisies at every corner. On the other hand, if you aim at big money and unlimited power, you should keep in mind that ''balls'' may well put you on the top, but it is only brains that may keep you there.    Last but not least, it may be remarked that, sadly, there are some pusillanimous countries (like Germany, for one) where the movie is offered only in a censored version some 16 minutes shorter. The final gunfight melee, the notorious scene with the chainsaw and the one in which Frank met his maker are the parts that suffer most badly, everything that offends the faint-hearted being severely cut; also a lot of cocaine sniffing and the scene of Manny with his bombshell blond in the bed have been left out. Needless to say, this mutilated version is way weaker than the original one. Besides, none of the cut passages has anything really shocking to offer; ever the horrid chainsaw scene, though it does have a lot of blood, is no big deal by the modern standards. I am always amused at such silly censorship today, when kids may easily access on the Web everything vile human nature has to offer.

0307341577|4.0|This is a well written, well paced story. Once you start reading it, the reader will find it difficult to put it down. It is an engrossing story, enhanced by the excellent, descriptive language that is at times jarring and disturbing. Once the preliminary information is presented, the reader will try to guess the ending or conclusion to the mystery underlying the main plot. Be forwarned though. The story is truly a dark place of humanity. There are several victims in the story. Poverty, mental illness, alcoholism, drugs, accusations of child molestation, despair, neglect, drugs, animal sacrifies, bullying, harsh and profane language are all in this story. There are so many layers.  Readers who like mysteries without the sterotypical super detective will enjoy this one.  Highly recommend for a movie of the week.
B004LWZW42|4.0|As a long-time fan of the comic, I am consistently wowed with the quality of the x-men films, particularly the first trilogy, which is the best adaptation of comic characters for the screen I have ever seen.  Sure, this and Wolverine are not quite as good, but they are definitely in the same league.<br /><br />Beyond a wonderful story, the greatest fun of this film is to see the relationships between the early characters, many of whom become the deadliest of adversaries 30 years or so later.  I was surprised to learn that Xavier and Mystique essentially grew up together, she as an adopted and beloved sister who wanted him to become her husband; after his rejection, she almost got together with Hank, then ultimately chose Magneto when he insisted she appear as her natural self.  Meanwhile, the background and character of Magneto are fully developed, from his incarceration as a Jew in Hitler's Germany to his enlistment by a mysterious psychopath as played to perfection by Kevin Bacon.  Once he mastered his powers with Xavier's help, Magneto comes to treat others as he himself was treated.  Finally, the relationship - like warring but loving brothers - between Xavier and Magneto, representing the two poles that the mutant community must choose.  It is superbly acted, mostly by relative unknowns.  I hope that this will spawn its own series.<br /><br />The plot is also very engaging.  Placing the mutants smack in the middle of the Cuban Missile Crisis, we learn the hidden history behind not just its inception, but its resolution and the terrible dangers that were avoided are great imaginative reconstructions.  There are also some great new characters with unusual powers.<br /><br />Yep, this will have to be added to our collection.  Warmly recommended.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|No words in the dictionary can describe this Anthology set, a MUST BUY without a doubt for any alien franchise fan or any sci-fi/horror/action fan who haven't had the opportunity to see these films. These are the greatest you will ever be able to see the films up to date and an incredible restoration they did, looks fantastic and more enjoyable to watch seeing it so good. The amount of extras which are 60 hours plus is just incredible and when there are so many extras i just cannot list them all, that alone is worth the price, worth every cent indeed. I wish tons more blu-rays would create unique packaging and take their time with their blu-rays, this is truly to me, the standard in which i judge all box sets by. What an incredible boxset and I absolutely loved the huge digibook US version, job well done indeed. The Anthology receives my utmost and highest rating possible, 6 out of 5 stars indeed!

B001E45XT4|5.0|I got these headphones a little over 3 months ago and I've been very pleased with them so far. The cord is sturdy, the ear cups are quite comfortable, and the sound seems great to me. I'm a musician, but I don't do any studio work so I've never used any high quality headphones before, but the sound quality on these is great. The volume goes loud enough that often times I turn it up all the way, put the headphones on my desk and use them as speakers. As a gamer these work great for me, the microphone works great and has built in noise-cancellation, and when you aren't using it it slips right into the frame.    The only possible drawback to the headphones themselves is that they don't block out outside sounds at all. For me that's fine, although at times I've wished I could mute out my roommates when they blast their own music, but like I said before the volume goes so high that I usually just turn it up until it drowns them out.    I highly recommend these to anyone looking for good headphones at an affordable price.

0061251321|5.0|I've been a student of human development and culture development for decades.  Tribal Leadership is a great compliment to the book Leadership Agility.  Together, they are more powerful than apart from each other.  I've used the TL model for the last two years in my consulting work to both diagnose and change cultures.  People \\"get it\\" right away, which makes it very useful.  In fact, I took the TL Intensives, both 1 and 2, from the authors.  Worth the time and money.  Read the other reviews.  Buy the book.  It will help you to make sense of your tribe, and it will help you to behave in ways that will eventuate in your emergence as the leader of your tribe.  However, know that there is way more to tribal leadership than is contained in this book.  Study, interact, get on their website, and join in the open source learning that is taking place.  Very worthwhile stuff.

1416583432|2.0|Despite some interesting anecdotes, I found very little of value in this book.  Having lived with dogs my whole life, I found many of the author's conclusions to be completely off.  The dog info aside, I found the writing to be pretty torturous...pretentious, overly whimsical, and somewhat condescending.  The footnotes on virtually every page made me want to chuck the book in the trash every time I picked it up.  Enough already.  We know the author is educated and intelligent, and we don't need distracting and useless footnotes on every page to remind us just how much the author learned in school.   This book frustrated me, and I would have gained more from watching reruns of the Dog Whisperer.  I don't recommend wasting your money on this book.

B0031YJFCQ|3.0|Although I've enjoyed Larsson's books as whodunits, I've never been able to understand why the pricky, tattooed and pierced heroine Lisbeth Salander caught on with so many readers. Larsson is a pretty clunky writer and, beyond Salander, his characters are little more than sketches. He's a pot-boiler plotter for sure, but there's a lot of slice of life repetition -- showers, coffee, sandwiches, slept xx hours, etc. -- to provide plenty of dull stretches in these way-too-long books. As the culmination of his Millennium trilogy, Hornet's Nest must have surely been a disappointment to many readers. With Salander safely locked up in either an intensive care unit or prison cell for 99 percent of the book, there's far too much talk-talk and far too little action-action in this novel. The story consists of three threads -- Salander's recovery from a gunshot to the head and surreptitious resumption of her hacking while under police guard, Blomkvist's unraveling of of very long and very twisted conspiracy against Lisbeth Salander, and the determined efforts of that secret cabal to silence her once and for all. There are also two subplots -- one concerning the job change of Blomkvist's long-time mistress, Erica Berger, and the other concerning the new girl in his life. While I was interested in the how-to aspects of all three threads and happy to see Salander vindicated at last, I couldn't help thinking that many readers would find this finale too slow for their taste.
B00015TOCY|5.0|Brian Eno's ambient works are all worthwhile, some more rewarding listens than others. If I want to clear the air and give myself space to breathe, a thorough immersion in Ambient 1 Music For Airports, Neroli or Thursday Afternoon usually does the trick. But the dizzing heights of Eno's art, in my opinion, is on full display in the albums with vocals and -- more or less -- proper song structures. Another Green World, Before and After Science and Taking Tiger Mountain By Strategy are each definitive statements in Eno the weird, eccentric singer/songwriter. Here Come the Warm Jets is a bit raw for my taste. Taking Tiger Mountain By Strategy -- released in 1974 -- is the best of the lot. When you hear the ten great tunes on Taking Tiger Mountain, in all its strange glory, it's clear how pivotal Eno was to shaping Roxy Music's sound in the early days. It was this style and sound that would influence David Bowie's work for years to come as well. Burning Airlines Give You So Much More starts things off in fine fashion. The Fat Lady of Limbourg with its contagious fat saxophone part is a trip, man. Third Uncle, often covered by other acts, really rocks and has the greatest electric guitar riff from the incomparable Phil Manzanera. Manzanera shines through-out this set and The True Wheel has another guitar part that will stick with you forever. The very odd Put A Straw Under Baby -- which feels like a day at the circus -- features some of Eno's best lines including: \\"There's a brain at the table, there's a heart in the chair and they all live in Jesus, it's a family affair.\\" The lengthy title track Taking Tiger Mountain, with it's spiralling chorus \\"We climbed and we climbed, oh how we climbed...to top Tiger Mountain\\" is transcendant. Eno sings in his inimitable voice and plays all manner of electronics, snake guitar and keyboards. The album features a great supporting cast with Brian Turrington on bass, Freddie Smith on drums, Andy MacKay of Roxy Music fame adds brass, while the Portsmouth Sinfonia offers the weird, off-kilter strings on Put A Straw Under Baby. Phil Collins, as he does on other Eno albums, makes a cameo on drums as well. Rhett Davies, assisted by Robert Ash, engineered Taking Tiger Mountain. Anyway, it's a simply amazing batch of songs from Eno. A classic of the genre!!
B001NLKT60|4.0|Fire is the second of the late Stieg Larsson's Millenium trilogy, and I liked it much more than the first novel. Dragon Tattoo featured a fairly conventional story that combined a missing heiress element with a serial sex slayer. Two things stood out in that novel for American readers -- the setting in Sweden and the anti-social computer hacker Lisbeth Salander. Larsson must have realized how appealing readers would find prickly Salander because he moved her front and center in Fire. When the story opens, Salander is in the Caribbean after a year-long journey which has taken her hopscotching from Europe to Asia and across the US. After a hurricane ravages the tropical island where she's been staying for some months, Lisbeth heads back to Sweden, determined to refashion her life without Mikael Blomkvist, her sleuthing partner from the first book. While Salander is busy finding and furnishing a new apartment, Blomkvist is editing a young reporter's book on the Swedish sex trade, and Salander's perverted \\"guardian\\" is lining up a hit man to eliminate the \\"ward\\" whose vengeance for rape has ruined his life. When Salander's fingerprints turn up on the murder weapon at the scene of a double-homicide, the Swedish media gloms on to the tale of the pierced and tattooed Salander, who's dubbed a \\"lesbian satanist\\" by some cops and quickly convicted in the court of public opinion. Newsman Blomkvist, of course, is having none of it, and as the book unfolds he and Salander, each acting independently, peel back the layers of her past to reveal who she really is and why she's again been targeted by a secret cabal. Salander again is the most interesting character in the book, largely perhaps because she's the only character Larsson actually develops. Through the course of the novel, she changes and grows while Blomkvist and the other continuing characters remain static from one book to the next, with their lives, characters and conflicts essentially unchanged.
B00004XQ83|5.0|based on some of the reviews, i just wonder why music is compared to a movie rather than just enjoying the music for the music itself...obviously there are those reviewers who got caught up in the emotionalism of the movie and expected the music to create that same dynamic...it is simply music, no story line....speaking of which that is what i really like about this album is just the simplicity of many of the songs...nothing complicated or loud, just good clean mountain music...if you are looking for fancy schmancy music, this isnt the album for you.
B004WJRF6C|2.0|For the most part, this is crap. It contains a few good songs, but honestly, these are just fragments that he threw together. I love and admire Paul. He is a genius that can make great records when he wants. Let's hope he is serious on the next release, as he was with \\"Chaos and Creation.\\"
B004WCTLNY|5.0|\\"All I have are the choices I make, and I choose her, come what may.\\"  While on a bus politician David Norris (Damon) meets Elise Sellas (Blunt) and soon after the depart he thinks he has lost her forever.  When she starts to show up at more and more of the places he is at he thinks he is the luckiest man alive.  Until he meets the \\"Bureau\\".  When told it will ruin both thier lives if they continue to see each other Norris has a decision to make.  While the movie reminded me a lot of \\"Inception\\", it was also one of the more original movies that I have seen.  There is quite a but of religious undertones, being that the movie is about how your life has a \\"plan made by the Creator\\", but it is in no way a religious themed movie.  Much like \\"Inception\\" this is a dramatic/sci-fi/thriller, and it seems like this may be a new genre and type of movie that will continue to be made. I am OK with that.  A great cast adds to the enjoyment of the movie and this is one that will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout.  Overall I would say if you liked \\"Inception\\" you will love this one.  This movie is also much, much easier to understand then \\"Inception\\" was, and almost as good. Great, great movie.  I say A.<br /><br />Would I watch again? - I absoutely will. I want to buy this.<br /><br />*Also try - Inception & Speed Of Thought
B004L3AQFG|5.0|It hits hard but it's very emotionally satisfying. It gives a strong message that you should appreciate life. It's a beautiful movie and you should not avoid it just because of one small scene.
B004WJRDN2|5.0|After last year's reissue of Band on the Run, I was very excited to hear McCartney's next two reissues in his Archive series were McCartney and McCartney II. Having owned both the original cd issues from Capitol, I've been longing for a cleaner version of both albums. The results are very satisfying.<br /><br />As far as the remastering process goes, the music from both albums sound as good as the original master tapes will ever sound. As with my review for John Lennon's Signature Box Set, I only wish the team at Abbey Road would use the original multi track sessions to improve on the mixes. Either way, I'm very satisfied with the sound quality here.<br /><br />As for the delux edition! The 128 page book is filled with photos from my favorite McCartney era. There is just something about McCartney's first album that radiates honesty and simplicity. The history in the photos of him, Linda and family are fun and make me (as a 20+ year old) long for such a point in my own life. The bonus discs are interesting. A mixture of outtakes and live performances from wings and early 90's material is present. There's a small documentary on the making of the album but if you haven't checked out the documentary Wingspan, I urge you to do so!<br /><br />The perk of this set is the 24 bit audio available in the form of download! The audio quality is beautiful but downloading them can be a pain. Luckily Topspin has a great help support team and has got back to me right away with solutions.<br /><br />If you're looking for a better sounding version of McCartney then you all ready own, this release is the one to get! It rivals anything else available. If you've been waiting for reviews on the deluxe edition, I'll simply say this is the definitive release of this record!
1594202710|5.0|I am not a fan of Kissinger's because of his advocacies in many political decisions concerning war and American power that violated human rights.  In fact, I believe he should be tried by the World Court and be locked up.  However, should he plea for clemency before the World Court, I would be in favor of granting him a much reduced sentence based on his grand accomplishment of helping to bring China out of isolation and possibly preventing the takeover of China by the Soviet Union.  In so doing, he helped to better the lives of millions of Chinese and to improve U.S.-China relationships.  Kissinger's rapprochement with China was done for selfish reasons (U.S. interest).  Nevertheless by helping to possibly prevent a Soviet-China war, he benefited the world, particularly if such a war went nuclear.    With respect to his book,  I must say, after reading many Western writers of Chinese history only Kissinger really wrote anything close to reality.  Most of Western writers are so encumbered with their Euro-centric upbringing, I find their analysis of the facts implausible based on my understanding of Chinese history and the Chinese people.  (I am Chinese born in Taiwan).  Having heard so much unenlightened invectives against China and her leaders from tin-horn American and European politicians, who seem to be living on a different planet, it is refreshing to finally hear someone speak competently on this  subject .  This book is well written, contains many interesting facts that I was not aware of previously, and easy to read.  I bought the hard covered version as well as the audio version from Audible.com.   I will pass them on to my children to read.      Kissinger makes Hilary Clinton and President Obama  look like high-school physics students trying to explain relativity and quantum mechanics to Einstein.  (and I voted for both Clinton and Obama).   It behooves our secretary of state, our president, as well as all Americans to read this book.  Failure to properlyunderstand China will lead us to our own peril
B0052UZIFA|4.0|It's definitely a classic, but there seem to be a few bugs.  My Samsung Vibrant keeps locking up on it, and once already the game lost my completed adventure progress, so that I have to play the entire adventure again to do Quick Play.  Kind of annoying.  Also, it tends to lag pretty bad at times.  Closing the app and restarting fixes that.
0316069485|2.0|Connelley has a deserved reputation for tight, hard edged writing in the crime and mystery genres. This time its just sort of tired out. The book re-unites his two popular characters Harry Bosch, and Mike Haller (the Lincoln Lawyer). He also recycles a few ex-wives, and kids, and plot elements from previous books. This is a page turner, but you keep turning to find out where the story went.  Haller, a long time defense lawyer, for some reason that is not clear takes on the job of being a prosecutor, then screws it up in a tyro error by letting the defendant loose. This is presented as if its some super slick move, but, its just dumb. And then it goes down hill from there. The rest of the story involves will-he-or-won't -he back and forth on the evildoer (goes nowhere). Since this is a 24 year old case there is little to investigate, the procedural elements are pretty tired (we all know the guy did it), and everyone sweats and stays up late in police cars trying to make any of it interesting. No luck.  Then at the end people we don't even know or care about get iced (because of another dumb move by the police/faux prosecutor) and we throw all that away and just call it quits. You probably should too, and wait for a better effort.
B004SEVPWQ|5.0|The graphics are fantastic. The game reality is great, and very challenging AI (droid opponent). I love the variety of billiard games within, I was truly astonished. Not a hitch so far! Works like silk on my Desire, not to mention how incredible it looks and performs on a Tegra hardware tablet.
0671027573|5.0|This is one of my favorite Linda Howard novels. I have reread it many times, loving the blend of humor, flirting, sex, and suspense. The back and forth between the leads reminds me of a super sexy version of those great Cary Grant movies like His Girl Friday or Philadelphia Story.
B0052OWGYW|4.0|i like all his movies.  so i will watch him no matter what the film is.  i did not see the original with charles bronson. although i did like this movie there were a few things i would have liked to see. and along with that, a few things i didnt like.  the plot is good, the acting is good, donald sutherland although a small part was fantastic and brings with him a credibility to add to the film.  i cant say to much and if you have not seen it maybe you shouldnt read any further just in case i say something that spoils it for you.  jason's character a master hitman, ends up having a conflict with his master. my problem with this is , after all the years of knowing his master and mentor, he takes the word of the firm that his mentor was no good.  there is no explanation, and not even a hint of jason's character asking the question \\"why\\" does the firm want my mentor and friend our of the picture.  also, he takes on his mentors son as his protoge and in doing so, there is little training, and they didnt go anywhere to develop any kind of relationship between the two.  you are left wondering what he really thinks of him.  you see a hint of compassion, and a hint of thoughts that he owed it to him out of respect for his mentor. but they dont do anything to develop a relationship between the two, and then they are off to do jobs.  they could and should have done more with this movie.  it had great potential.  i thought it was over to fast, and it left a few questions that should have been answered. it felt rushed.  but it is a good movie and has good action and good acting, and its worth watching.  i will see all his movies and this one is worth watching.....
B004MNO0BQ|1.0|Down loaded to see how I liked it on a larger screen.  It doesn't support the galaxy tab 10.1 at all.   Will uninstall.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|Doctor Who is my favorite show, and this is one purchase I do not even slightly regret.    It's fun, it looks just like the one on the show, and it made me feel like the doctor.     Also, it came two days before expected, which was awesome!   I'd recommend this product and this seller to any fan of Doctor Who and anyone who likes fun.
0316056863|5.0|BOSSY PANTS is one to read when you want to laugh from deep within. Tina Fey has a way with words that she can work in her witty humor, her world views, prejudice against women, and feminism in her self-deprecating way that ultimately inspires. She's a powerhouse of fun and inspiration and makes our every day lives feel exciting! There is no room for boredom! I highly recommend!
B004XIQIPQ|3.0|I am not the kind of person who criticizes The Arctic Monkeys for their dramatic change in sound.  I love when artists mature, and develop their \\"own\\" sounds.    I LOVED the first album from Arctic Monkeys.  There was something about how direct it was that made it really catchy, upbeat, and a lot of fun.  Songs like \\"Mardy Bum\\", \\"The View from The Afternoon\\" and \\"When the Sun Goes Down\\" were some of the highlights.  These songs were 5 star material to me.    I disliked their second album, however.  \\"Brianstorm\\" and \\"Fluorescent Adolescent\\" were great tracks, along with a personal favorite \\"Balaclava\\", but other than that, most of the songs sounded the same.    I was happy to hear the DRAMATIC change in sound for \\"Humbug\\".  It sounded very different, dark, and mature.  However, I just couldn't really get into it.  Not saying it's bad music, because it wasn't, it was just hard to get into a lot of the more experimental tracks.    That leads to \\"Suck it and See\\".  My honest opinion of the album... is completely mixed.  The album opens up with one of my favorite tracks \\"She's Thunderstorms\\".  I like this track a lot because of how beautiful I think the vocal melody is during the verse.    Other than the opening track, \\"All My Own Stunts\\", \\"Love's a Lazerquest\\", \\"Black Treacle\\" and perhaps \\"Library Pictures\\", the rest of the tracks are really mediocre.  I think some of the worst tracks are \\"Brick by Brick\\" and \\"Don't Sit Down Because I've Moved Your Chair\\", and these songs seem to be going back closer to the roots of the band.  These songs just seem really basic, and cheesy to me.    I would like to add the note that I love \\"All My Own Stunts\\".  I think this is one of the best songs they have released.  It's awesome.
B003Z2LAAO|4.0|The 3D was pretty darn good. Rich detail and the birds eye view of the Canyon were awe inspiring. I try not to base my review on anything but 3D and how it looks but the I had a hard time simply taking in all the beauty because of the heavy conversationalist/ water conservation overtones through out the film. While I support the ideas expressed in the film I would have liked to have taken the beautiful raft river ride down the Colorado River free of interruption.<br />Very sharp and beautiful detail was apparent throughout the movie, and it gives you a sense of just how much depth the Grand Canyon has. Spectacular birds eye footage that when watching it in 2D lacks some of that luster that I saw in the 3d version. The 2d was still very pretty but which would you rather view, a screen of high definition images, or the birds eye as it sores through the canyon. I envy the birds.<br /><br />The 3d was good, the movie it self was alright, but I hoped to see more breathtaking images of the Grand Canyon and I did not get that. Robert Redford it seemed only narrated a tiny part of the movie. That was pretty disappointing, it was like they said Morgan Freeman was narrating a film, but than 90% of it was narrated by Andy Dick. I realize that has nothing to do with the 3d, but when I bought the film I was under a different expectation. Ultimately the film was pretty, but political overtones and 3 different narrators hindered my overall experience. Also if you are looking for another awesome Imax 3d movie check out Tahiti big wave. That was a fantastic 3D Imax movie.
1401922732|5.0|This card deck is incredibly ACCURATE and insightful. I wonderful tool for those seeking clear answers and insights to questions. I highly recommend!
630522577X|5.0|Wonderful!!!  Music and video restored to perfection.  This is an example of the great movies we used to enjoy.
B002L2GK0O|5.0|The reason why I bought this book is because it answered all my questions when I first started brewing. Now that I am becoming more experienced it still has a lot to offer. Honestly best book on home brewing I have read. It is easy to understand, have pictures, and has information for both beginner and experienced.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|The story told by Jack it made more thoughtful and compassionate! Can't wait to see a movie based on this book! It deserves it!<br />My sis is a single parent and I pictured her and my nephew all the way thru the book - thankfully, the circumstances are totally different -.<br />It made me think what mothers, especially, do for their kids to keep going; no matter what!<br />It's a great book for mother's days to tell tell, THANK YOU for everything you do for my everyday mom!
B004DI7HZ6|2.0|Wish I'd read some of the other reviews before I read the book. It's an adult version of the popular overheated teenage vampire romances. And somehow I missed that this was Book One of a trilogy. My library copy had tape over that part of the sleeve. I grew suspicious when I was past page 500 and they weren't even close to wrapping it up. Sure enough, I discovered that the nearly 600 pages were spent introducing the characters and laying the foundation for an actual plot, which I assume will occur in Book Two.<br /><br />Agreeing with the other reviewers' comments about the attention to detail paid to mundane and repetitive events such as picking out clothes or practicing yoga, I also loved the over-dramatization of Diana's and Matthew's conversations. Every time he said some trivial thing she didn't like, she became \\"furious\\" with him, then switched back to lovey-dovey as soon as Matthew made some conciliatory gesture. Pretty teenager-ish for 35 and 1500 year old adults.<br /><br />Another howler is Diana's rescue from a kidnapping, imprisonment and beating (which, at that point, I actually enjoyed reading about). Her rescuers simply discuss it for a minute, pick a location out of thin air, and race there to free her.<br /><br />This book falls solidly into the Women's Fantasy Literature category, with a protagonist who is smart, pretty, accomplished, snags a hunky boyfriend, and who stands to inherit (if he dies, which is difficult but not impossible) one third of what he owns, which is pretty much one third of everything on planet Earth.<br /><br />If that's your thing, I guess this is a workmanlike example of the genre. If you are looking for something with the same literary and creative possibilities as something like \\"Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell\\", keep looking.
B001PPGAIA|4.0|OK, it's a little long.  But let's check out what's inside: It's got comedy, drama, action, a cattle drive, some scheming scoundrels,a war, racism and anti-racism, romance, and one charming kid.  It's got a manly hero and a rather diverse performance by the leading lady. There's something for everyone and some historical perspective as well.  There are some genuine wholesome laughs.  I don't consider it a children's movie.  But if you want an entertaining way to spend a rain afternoon, I'd recommend it.
B000000WJ2|5.0|If you are a Richards fan, and primarily if you are not, you need to listen to this album and all of the rest done with the Winos. This is bare nuckled rock and roll,how it should be. Almost 20 years after the albums, these are musical gems, particularly compared to what passes as Rock these days. Regardless of your view on the 'Stones, Keith Richards shows in these albums that he was and is the driving force behind the music that basically defined more than a generation of Rock. Sir Mick can sing(but not here, but Keith can play and sing wonderfully. His voice actually really got a lot better with age, and I prefer his vocalizations to a \\"Jagger\\" style. There are some \\"fillers\\" as noted before, but even those are better than anyone else is doing today. Although the albums did not get huge airplay when they came out originally, they certainly have gotten better with age. Any true Rock and Roller has to have these.    I would go to the Crossroads and trade today if I could have about 50% of what Keith can do.
B004RSCWZ2|4.0|Rolling Stone compared them to \\"Delaney Bonnie & Friends\\". While this isn't totally inaccurate, it led me to believe there'd be a lot of soulful vocal harmony, and some high-energy rave-ups to balance the lower-key numbers. In fact, there's almost no harmony, and not one truly blazing tune.
B004Z2TUGE|4.0|I enjoyed the movie, but it seemed more like a made for TV movie than for the big screen and the ending was so cliche TV series setup.
B002ZG999U|2.0|The Expendables is an example of false marketing. We have a fabulous myriad of action actors all claiming top billing. I expected to see a troupe of guys kicking butt in some dumb steroid-filled action frenzy. I was mistaken.<br /><br />This film belongs entirely to Sylvester Stallone and Jason Statham. Why are the other guys even there? Statham and Stallone are about the only characters to have anything to really do with moving the plot forward, going together to an island to free a girl from a tyranny. Which is fine, but what about Jet Li? He basically does nothing but complain about not getting paid enough. Bruce Willis? He appears for about a total of 60 seconds, barely even enough to qualify as supporting actor, let alone top billing. Even Mickey Rourke does nothing but sit around making tattoos and lamenting his lost humanity. In any other situation I would have welcomed such exposition, but what about all the rest?<br /><br />The Expendables does have its fair few action scenes, naturally. The film opens up pretty much in your face, with our heroes rescuing hostages from a pirate boat, and in quite a macho fashion too. I thought the rest of the movie would be like that. We do have a fight scene on a basketball court and a fast-paced fight in the trenches of a palace, with heavy adrenaline rush. I knew the movie was aiming for this, and it is an entertaining enough action movie, just without any real punch like, say, all of Arnold Schwarzenegger's action movies (arguably the king of action movies, and he appears for even less screen time than Willis, and then in the role of a politician. How the mighty have fallen).<br /><br />What annoys me about The Expendables is that it promised us an all-star extravaganza of actors and most of the time that just isn't the truth. Most of the actors are barely even there. They should just have marketed this as a buddy picture between Stallone and Statham, because that's basically what The Expendables is. I'd have more respect for it then.
B0053EZXRS|3.0|Overall I thought this movie was good, but it had more nudity than I cared for and the usually bad language that I have gotten used to excepting. Still the avenging angel from hell has been done before by him...ghostrider.
0316056863|5.0|It's so worth reading simply because she's always come off as the best friend you'd love to have, and frankly this is as close as any of us will ever come to sitting in a room and picking her brain about \\"30 Rock\\", \\"SNL\\" or that dead on Palin impersonation.
B004HFON7K|5.0|My whole family loved this movie! Enough said! Some where I missed the extended scenes from the original. It is still an excellent movie.
B004H4XLR4|5.0|My son (2.5 years old) loves all things Cars and all transportation. Siddeley looks great, seems durable, has limited assembly needed (VERY easy, the tail slots right in) and you can store several cars inside (I know it says '3', but you can put at least 5 in there stacked on top, and more if you're putting Guido, Luigi and Uncle Topolino in there).  Great imaginative play toy.  Siddeley flies around during the day and snuggles with my son at night. Definitely worth the $.
B004Q7E0TA|5.0|If you're looking for a book to read in your spare time this was a great read. Especially if you are a Portia de Rossi fan.
0553805371|4.0|Been reading physics related books and magazine articles for about forty years (also have a B.Sc. in Biophysics) and I would say this is the best overview of modern physics and thinking about the Universe to come along since Hawkings previous treatise \\"A brief History of Time\\". Though not as comprehensive scientifically as that 20 year old work, this one is perhaps more accessible to the lay person. That said, I am not much closer to understanding the origins of the Universe, as abstractions such as \\"no boundary\\" and \\"multi universe\\" remain for me elusive mathematical concepts, as I am sure they do to many. Also the apparent conclusion that \\"there is no God\\" seems to be replaced by \\"there is Gravity, but we don't know exactly what that is ...\\". Still, a worthwhile and easy read at under 200 pages.
B000UZQI0Q|4.0|So I had read many of the reviews prior to reading this and got very mix results.  Some seemed to be too good to be true and fanboish while the ones that seemed more grounded were quite negative.    So I am going to try to offer maybe a more objective review.    If you are here just for a good action book with lots of fight scenes that are done well you may want to look somewhere else I would probably only give it a 3 out 5 if thats all you are looking for.  I would recommend Salvatore if you want great action sequences because while the author is not bad at action there is something to be desired still.  It is oddly much darker and carries a much more somber tone than the first book even though the Lord Ruler from the first book was overthrown which I think some may find this off putting especially since it does take an effect on the characters and make them moodier and at times whiny and annoying.    That being said I will still stand by my 4 out 5 rating as I think the author actually played to his strengths in this book which in my humble opinion is that of advancing your understanding of the world in which the story takes place and the lore surrounding it,  Character development and nice subtle plot twists and hiding gems of information in seemingly mundane segments that turn out to be quite important when the pieces start falling into place at the end of the book.  I also am one who appreciates and enjoys the political posturing and intrigue and the attempt at making it more a battle of wits and character than of super hero runs around overcoming every challenge simply cause they are the all powerful chosen one.     One thing of note is that the author does a great job of developing the supporting cast much better than the main characters.  You get great insight into and awesome development of characters like Breeze, Ham, Clubs, Sazed, Marsh and even Straff Venture as well as others that I will not mention for fear of any spoilers.  The Author does this artfully and subtly enough that it feels natural with these characters while his attempts with Vin and Ellend can feel forced and over done causing them to come across childish and annoying at times which can be frustrating and slow the pace of the book.  It does somewhat excuse itself towards the end for this when you realize the attempt by the author to get across the idea that you must understand yourself if you are ever to expect how to understand others and help them but its somewhat of a sloppy attempt and the supporting characters are the ones that actually carry the idea to any sense of legitimacy.     As for the plot and premise of the story I think they are very well done and a great thought provoking narrative.  While some say the premise is forced for the sake of a sequel I would disagree there were many lose ends from the first book as well as the basic premise of instability and chaos in the wake of the Lord Rulers defeat is a very logical and likely scenario.  Which sets up nicely for a test of the characters resolve and strength of character to follow through on what they have started.  It also stretches the characters abilities and challenges them on a much broader scale and in the process it gives a noble attempt at providing understanding for human behavior and motives with all the political scheming and posturing as well as the personal moral and emotional battles many of the characters face.  In the end it provides a great plot twist that is both surprising as well as it makes sense and is not forced as you recall all the bits of information hiding through out the book.  Which is satisfying since it also makes things from the first book make more sense since I thought its twist and conclusion was actually quite lacking.     All in all I highly recommend this book as I feel that it is the book that generally most great series have that can be frustrating to read and leave you wondering why or what was the author thinking but when all is said and done you realize the point as all the pieces come together and you get the bigger picture the author was trying to paint as the seemingly mundane and frustrating aspects come back to have an impact on the final outcome in surprising yet logical fashion.
B004H4XJW6|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie, enough that I bought the DVD. My \\"kids\\" are in college, and they liked it, too. The special features were interesting, and the short feature was fun.  My only complaint: Considering the upcharge for the 2 disc set, I would have expected a few more extras on the second disc.
B004EPYZOO|1.0|In every movie, Nicolas Cage has seemed to act in the same monotonous, boring way. In this movie it was even WORSE. As others have described, if you're looking for a movie with nudity and blood you should waste two hours of your life on this one.
B00544L9EI|5.0|Finally people will realize Royce is a nice MC. No explaination needed for Marshall. Unlike so many collabation albums that are thrown together, these 2 MC's have history together and there chemistry is outstanding. This CDis a straight lyrical execrise beweteen the two. Buy this now! You will not be disappointed! My favorite songs are A Kiss, Reunion, and Loud Noises featuring Slaughterhouse. This is real hip hop!!
0307454541|5.0|I picked this up because it was on the best seller list and I didn't really know what to expect. The story started out slow, which made it in the beginning a little difficult to read and i would have put the book aside early on if I didn't read the other reviews that say it will get better. It really does. The ending of the book is fantastic and interesting. I enjoyed the story a lot though some of the characters in the book were portrayed with extreme characters such as women either being victimized or very strong, nothing in between. Since I enjoyed the story a lot, I can only recommend it.
B00006AW2G|5.0|My band's late, great roadie, Jeff, and I almost came to blows in 1972 about whether this or \\"Sticky Fingers\\" represented the Rolling Stones' greatest body of work.  I still contend that by just the mere inclusion of \\"Gimme Shelter,\\" there is NO finer album in the world.  Jeff argued, \\"Yeah, but how 'bout 'Brown Sugar?' 'Wild Horses?' \\"  He may or may not have been right; but Kent, the wise sage who was our guitarist, spake but four words: \\"Exile On Main Street.\\"  Jeff and I stopped fighting and...\\"lit a cigarette...\\"  Still..when I kick, I want the Hymn, \\"Living For Jesus,\\" Weather Report's \\"A Remark You Made,\\" and the etherial \\"Gimme Shelter\\" played @ my funeral.  (not that I'll have all that much to do about it...as John Maynard Keynes once so happily observed, \\"In the future, we are all dead.\\") 8/11/12 - Yeah, well...say, when is...whoever controls the music for \\"Let It Bleed,\\" Sticky Fingers,\\" and \\"Beggars Banquet,\\" going to do the big re-packaging, re-mixing, blah-blah-blah, thing that A&M did for \\"Some Girls,\\" UM (?) for \\"Sticky Fingers,\\" and ABKCO for \\"Let It Bleed?\\"  \\"Gimme Shelter\\" & \\"Brown Sugar\\" CERTAINLY deserve the same re-whatevering that that POS \\"Miss You\\" received.
030745455X|5.0|The sequel to The Girl with the dragon tattoo is just as good as the first one.  It was very well researched and well written. As was the case with Larson's first book, the The Girl who played with the fire takes about 250 pages or so to get rolling but once it does, it's very entertaining and comes with the perfect cliffhanger ending.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|I really really love this game and if it wasn't for that, I would have probably stopped trying to play it a long time ago. Unfortunately the game will crash at random, sometimes seconds after I start playing, and restart my phone. A couple of times I had to go as far as pulling the battery out because it was frozen and wouldn't respond. If they ever fix the issues, I would certainly give it a much higher rating. I'm using a Nexus S.
0446614459|1.0|The premise for this book is totally stupid. I finished it because I kept hoping it would improve. It didn't.  SPOILER  An example of how dumb: Two high level secret service agents find a weapon put it in the glove compartment of their car. Do not lock the glove box, don't lock the car. It gets stolen while their in the house. Is this dumb or what?
0316548189|5.0|Mandela's chronicle of his long struggle for human rights in South Africa is one of the most riveting tales of courage, dedication and commitment to freedom for all I've ever read. A must-read for anyone who cares about everyone's need for democratic equality regardless of race, color, gender or religion.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|This game is addicting!  Would have given it 5 stars.  But based on the amount of RAM your phone has, it can eat up your phone resources really quick.  It is likely to crash the phone consistently during game play.  The phone freezes,  then does a panic reset.     I have played this game on 2 Motorola Phones, and the other a Samsung Phone.  While it works decent on the Motorola Phones (Droid 2 Global) (with an occasional phone crash here an there), it would crash the phone consistently on the Samsung Droid Charge.    Find a way to increase garbage collection and reduce RAM consumption and this app would be golden.  It defintiely requires some optimization.
1439181780|5.0|This book is a life changing book, I ordered to share with love ones and friends.  I'm going to order more copies since Amazon can ship anywhere in the US for me.
B003L77GGK|5.0|Supernatural is a seriously underrated show. It is on a tiny network, gets ratings that the NBCs of this world wouldn't get out of bed for, and is never considered for awards. Yet it is still here - six seasons and renewed for a seventh. The reason? It is a great show; brilliantly acted, brilliantly written, great stories. It is made by a tight team in front and behind the cameras, and even after 6 years they still care about making a quality show.<br /><br />This season has a different feel to the earlier seasons, but maintains the quality we have come to expect. The storyline twists and turns and takes you places you never thought it would go. And it has some of the best eps of the show ever; the hilarious The French Mistake, Dean and Sam go to the old west in the great fun Frontierland, we get an excellent Bobby-centric ep directed by Jensen Ackles, the moving and wonderful Like a Virgin (including the best scene the show has had for 2 or 3 years), and many, many more.<br /><br />Buy it. You won't regret it.
B000MD9UJC|5.0|Most of my flashlights are high-end cree 2xCR123 lights, so I never used to touch my mini mag. I considered getting the $18 upgrades, but that's halfway to a nice 1xCR123 Cree XM-L light, so I couldn't justify the price. Then I found this upgrade... I'm really impressed with it! It won't make your mini mag come close to a nicer cree light, but it's bright enough that I actually use the thing now instead of letting it sit in a drawer untouched!
B000GCFO0I|5.0|I am not going to say much, as I dont want to spoil anything, but if you like a good scary movie, and have not seen this, its very good IMO.  Love Sean Bean as an actor, he was great in Game of Thrones (my heart was breaking a little in the 6/12/11 episode \\"Baelor\\" ).  Kim Coates never disapoints, and Radha Mitchell did great work.
0312600844|5.0|Loved this great piece of literature that portrays the modern day self observed society. Great read for anyone who is looking for something different.
031603441X|5.0|The book arrived in a timely manner and in perfect condition. My only complaint is there was   no pizza along with it!!! I haven't read the book yet, so no comment on the content, but the   delivery was great.
1439153663|5.0|WOW!!!  This is a wonderful book.      When you start reading \\"The Kitchen House\\" plan to do nothing else but read, read, read!!!!!  You can read other reviews that will tell you something of the story.  But, I want you to know that the writing is absolutely wonderful.      There is never a time when you feel it is a novel.  You become completely immersed and feel that you are living these experiences; that Belle and Lavinia have just stepped from the room and will be returning to lead you through more of their lives.  Ms. Grissom has done a superlative job of writing a believable book told by 2 voices that hold your attention throughout.      Unfortunately, this book moves quickly, and without a sequal available, you are left feeling as if you have experienced the death of your whole family when it ends.  What a tour de force for a first time author.  There are simply not enough superlative words to describe what a wonder this book is.    I will be watching Amazon for more works by Kathleen Grisson.  Her writing is without unequal.
B004RSCWZ2|4.0|Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi have been married for some time now. They have been appearing together for some time in concert now but because they were signed to seperate record companies, they haven't been able to do much together in the studio. This is their first full fledged CD as a team.  For those who have seen them together in concert, this is in that spirit: a blend of R&B, rock, blues with a gospel feeling and a little funk and world music tossed in for good measure. Categorizing it isn't easy but it is a very enjoyable sound. The band is strong with Allman Brothers bassist Oteil Burbridge and his brother Kofi among the standouts. 4.5 stars.
B003Y5H54W|1.0|The story idea had potential but the obvious, always clean, costume shop made clothing; heavy use of cosmetics (mostly female); nicely machined tools; poorly developed storyline (mostly tired, used to many times script and disjointed if not missing background and continuity to the story itself); ripped off Twilight wolf graphics; and finally sophomoric acting result in a disappointing and  inadequate production.   Nice, entice-to-rent, Twilight like graphics on the DVD cover - though.
B00362DRQS|5.0|Amazing edition of this great record, the video \\"As the lights goes down\\" was a register of the wonderful fase of this unique band.
B0051RP4DA|5.0|I am glad I ignored many of the negative reviews and bought this album.  It demonstrates the growth of Eddie Vedder as a musician, singer, and song writer.  When I see comments like the all songs sound the same I have to ask myself - has that person actually listened to the album?  Perhaps, since I don't think all of Jack Johnson's songs sound the same makes me a bad listener?  For those that think this should be similar to Pearl Jam - you have got to be kidding....this is a great collection of songs, short songs, that highlight Eddie's vocals and proficiency with a new instrument - simply beautiful!  Just listen to the preview tracks, if this is not your cup of tea - don't buy it...for the rest of us enjoy one of the best artists in the last 20 years with a fresh new album.
B004FVHBXY|4.0|Definitely an entertaining movie!    The effects are great, the storyline/concept was very interesting, and the graphics are top-notch.  If you like the Mission Impossible-type movies, this would be right up your alley.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I am not kidding. I have read thousands upon thousands of books and this book was AMAZING. I will be reading everything this other puts out there. She will make magic come out of any and every book she writes guarunteed. Wow the story was so good. All of the characters were perfect and the two main ones really were the most beautiful disasters imaginable. I fell in love with both of them. Well done. And please keep writing such wonderful books Ms. McGuire:)
B004NIFSRA|5.0|Gentlemen, I hope you will purchase this for the loved one(s) in your life.  You will thank me later!<br /><br />As a man, I have tried many times - and most unsuccessful in those efforts - to explain to women how a man really feels.  Some may call it more of my Mars self in an attempt to get in touch with the inner Venus.  Alas, I have been unsuccessful in relaying to the better half exactly what goes on in a man's mind, especially mine, which inevitably (a) starts a new argument, or (b) continues the ongoing argument.<br /><br />If only I was able to articulate how I really felt in a way a woman could understand!  I have searched for years for a \\"self help\\" or \\"how-to\\" guide to help me help them.<br /><br />Shed and Sheridan Simove should be nominated for some type of Pulitzer, or possibly even the Nobel Peace Prize, as this resource finally captures what I have tried to say over the years.  Finally, women will be able to understand a male's point of view.<br /><br />This handbook should be mandatory reading for each premarital counseling session conducted by the ministry or layperson as I am certain, for example, this book will be able to communicate 100% more than any catholic priest knows about the subject.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I can not believe this book is for young adults?!?! It is amazing I couldn't put it down. What a great story, brutal with a sweet love story. Be sure to read all three!
B0049P1VHS|1.0|I have seen more zombie movies than I would like to admit. Very few of them has been any good, in fact I can not remember a good one since the movie \\"28 days later\\". I had hoped this serie \\"Walking dead\\" would be good, but it is really not any good. There is not enough action, and I get the same sence of the show as when I started to watch \\"Lost\\". Short and sweat, it is not interesting enough, poor actors, sad special effects, horrible storie etc, etc.     If you are looking for a zombie movie, or \\"the world is going to hell\\", I recommend you buy these movies:    28 Days later  Dawn of the dead  Stephen King's - The Stand    I have seen the complete first season, and there is nothing at the end even teasing me to look into season II...
0470449748|1.0|The Math section is a good review for overall knowledge. However, it is NOT a good study reference for the actual GMAT. The Quantitative Portion of the GMAT was mainly number theory, not application as this review book prepares you for. I recommend using a college number theory reference, Not this book!
B000002OTL|4.0|It's probably just coincidence, but two of the selections on this now classic soundtrack have momentary \\"spoken bits\\" that are among my favorite little pop epiphany moments ever.  When Al Greene momentarily breaks from all that gliding about in his uppermost register on \\"Let's Stay Together\\" and utters the words \\"would you, baby?\\" as a spoken aside, it comes as a kind of mini-shock.  Is his speaking voice really that cracked--and that deep?  It's a split second thing, and then he's back in the stratosphere, but we were briefly, but definitely brought back down to earth there for a second.    Equally, effective is Dusty Springfield's sultry spoken, \\"yeah, he was the son of a PREACHER\\" at the end of her signature \\"Son of A Preacher Man.\\"  Are you sure she was just IN Memphis: she sounds like she could be FROM Memphis there.  Not bad for a girl who came to these sures as a distaff rep of the Brit Invasion a few years earlier.  Sly and seductive as the whole tune is, that little aside closes out the number on just the perfect note.    It may not just be coincidence, after all writer/director Tarentino is widely touted for his uncanny ear for actual conversation--to say nothing of his pop culture references.  This is one soundtrack album where the included dialog from the film actually ENHANCES the listening experience (particularly the \\"Royale With Cheese\\" and \\"Personality Goes A Long Way\\" bits).    Of course, this is one soundtrack that's celebrated for its inclusion of several long-forgotten instrumentals (including the \\"just right\\" selection of Dick Dale and the Del-Tones' \\"Miserlou\\" played over the opening credits), so the spoken dialog kind of offsets all that.  (Other instrumentals include the Tornadoes' \\"Bustin' Surfboards,\\" \\"Bullwinkle Part II,\\" and the Revels' \\"Comanche\\"--and, wisely, not a single late '60s endless jam in the bunch.    The sheer variety of the selections is indeed an impressive testimony to the scope of Tarantino's pop culture knowledge. You'vegot everything Ricky Nelson's \\"Lonely Town\\" (a forgotten '50s classic) to Maria McKee's less well known (but equally elegant country rock ballad) \\"If Love Is A Red Dress.\\"  More well known tunes like the Statlers' \\"Flowers On the Wall\\" and Chuck Berry's \\"You Never Can Tell\\" are obvious cultural touchstones.  Like most successful soundtracks consisting of previously recorded pop numbers, PULP FICTION's is a cleverly done array of familiar classics--and a few revelatory surprises.
0553805371|5.0|This is a fascinating book that explains many mind-blowing concepts in a clear manner that even the general public can follow, however, he doesn't convince me that his evidence truly or seamlessly ties the super-macro to the sub-micro, nor does he convince me he has ruled out a possible creator! That little chicken-and-egg problem has not gone away in my estimation!
B004NO5FO0|5.0|This a review for the box set of the first four books in the Song of Ice & Fire saga. I think it's appropriate here because there are no spoilers and if it makes you want to read the first book, you can save a nice piece of change by ordering the box set. Believe me, once you've read the first book, you will want the others.<br /><br />Here's the briefest possible plot summary of Ice & Fire to date (Volumes 1-4): Five factions are at war for the Iron Throne and control of the continent of Westeros. A sixth force is gathering power in the East across the Narrow Sea while ultimate Evil lurks in the North beyond the Wall. I don't intend to tell you any more of the story. To do so would be a grave disservice. It would ruin the shocks and surprises that await the reader. To borrow the tag line for the movie Sucker Punch, you are not prepared. No more story, but I do have more to say.<br /><br />A reviewer for Time magazine dubbed Martin \\"the American Tolkien\\". It makes me wonder if this reviewer has ever read The Lord of the Rings. You'd be hard pressed to find two more different Sword & Sorcery series. I'd say that any child who is old enough to want to read LOTR should do so. That's not the case with Ice & Fire. It's far too grim and gritty, far too bloody, and far too sexually explicit. Another difference is plotting. Once you get into LOTR you can pretty much know where the story is going to go. There may be a few bumps in the road, but it's pretty predictable. Ice & Fire is completely unpredictable. While you're reading, you may think you know where the story is headed. Trust me, you'll be wrong. A third difference is tone. LOTR was written from the perspective of a neutral observer. Ice & Fire is written from the point of view of the characters experiencing the events of the story. (In fact none of these books have chapters. Each section is labeled with the name of the POV character.) As a consequence, Ice & Fire struck an emotional chord with me (multiple ones actually) that I never felt with LOTR. LOTR was like watching a fun fantasy movie. Despite its dragons, sorcery, and wights (reanimated corpses),its giants and wargs (skin changers) Ice & Fire seems very real. It's like you are living the story. One final difference: LOTR is clearly a story of Good vs Evil. The One Ring may be able to corrupt a good person, but basically there is no trouble telling which side a character fits on. One of the many things I like about Ice & Fire is its moral ambiguity. Each of the six factions has a legitimate claim to the throne (at least by its own reasoning). Its true that one side seems more noble than the rest and another is nastier but men on the \\"good\\" side commit atrocities every bit as heinous as those on the \\"bad\\" side. Even the noblest character in A Game of Thrones (Eddard Stark) has warts (marital infidelity) and some of the \\"bad guys\\" turn out to be sympathetic characters.<br /><br />I must confess that I have never been fond of overly long novels. I suppose then that I should explain why I ordered this box set sight unseen. I had read the two prequel graphic novels, The Hedge Knight and The Sworn Sword, published by Marvel (based on George R.R. Martin's novellas). I liked both but not enough to buy these megabooks. Then I was blown away by the first episode of HBO's Game of Thrones series. That did it for me and I'm so glad that it did. I've just spent a big chunk of the last month or so of my life immersed in this fantastic world and loved every minute of it. Four books back-to-back-to-back-to-back, 3882 pages without a break (not counting the appendices). I've never done anything like that before and am unlikely ever to do it again. For me that pretty much defines \\"page-turner\\". Martin is an excellent plotter. He uses the same technique J.J. Abrams used with Lost. Every time you get to a point where you've just got to see what happens next, he switches scenes. I could almost hear the sound that indicated a scene change inLost. BRrruuUPP. Oh,no, don't stop now. Not now!<br /><br />I don't give out 5-star ratings easily. For me 5-stars means the work is exceptional. If ever there was a 5-star series this is it. (I should add that Volume 4 is not quite as good as the previous three books, but that's because my two favorite characters, Daenerys of House Targaryen, and Tyrion Lannister the Imp, do not appear in it. That will be remedied next month when Volume 5 comes out. I can't wait.) If Martin maintains the quality of the remaining volumes, this series will truly be a monumental achievement.<br /> Comment   Permalinkno, don't stop now. Not now!

0743454537|2.0|I really enjoyed the start of this book, the characters seemed complex, parents struggling with the heartbreak of a child slowly dying complicated by the moral dilemmas that genetic selection bring to medicine, but long before the end I felt like Jodi Picoult had stolen valuable hours of my life.  The end is so ridiculous, i felt I was watching a cheap one hour TV show where all the loose ends have to be wrapped up in the last 10 minutes. The fact that someone would still be devastated about being dumped by their High School boyfriend 15 years after it happened began to seem normal compared to the drivel that followed - if only I could get a time refund.
B0000AUHQT|5.0|A LOT of Newport exteriors make this quite plush. Still, this is the ultimate hot summer night must-see.  It mostly gives an insider-look at the selfish, greedy upper-class condition.  But so what- look at Robert Redford!
B0053Q9DHW|3.0|This had all of the right ingredients for a masterpiece (cast, directior, location, big budget), but is just fell flat!  The first part of the movie started out well enough, but by half way through, it just started to drag.  Mia Wasikowska and Michael Fassbender were wonderful as the leads...seperately!!  There were absolutely no chemistry or fireworks in their scenes together!  The ending scene in which Jane is re-united with Rochester was so abrupt and anti-climatic!  I was left with a feeling of \\"Is that it?\\".  My favorite version is the the Masterpiece Classic version with Toby Stephens and Ruth Wilson.  That version was longer and it put me in a \\"swoon\\" for all 4 hours!
B004EPZ07K|3.0|This movie was nowhere near as bad as a majority of the reviews on the internet would lead you to believe. Sure the movie's been getting trashed since it's release but overall it's an enjoyable film & I think from the fanboys standpoint perhaps the films not up to par with Green Lanterns rich history & mythology. From that viewpoint I can totally understand because like most movie adaptations the film feels a bit rushed in some parts & lacks some character development but hopefully a sequel will up the ante in action & character driven dynamics. I was never a huge follower of the Green Lantern comics but I think overall Martin Campbell, Ryan Reynolds, & company  did a pretty decent job. Green Lantern is nowhere near as bad as say, Catwoman or as embarrassing as both Matrix sequels.

B001CT81EU|5.0|Best crime drama to come along in years. It combines actors from different genres and decades and yet they work together flawlessly. Edward Norton's performance is hands down one of the best (without being psychotic) villains. Be sure to watch the extra's also!

B004LWZWEC|5.0|purchased this bluray and watched. Bonn Scott was the greatest front man rock and roll has ever seen AND THE HI DEF VIDEO REALLY BRINGS THAT OUT.That being said the audio part of the bluray loses it a little at the end of guitar notes in some songs like livewire and hell aint a bad place to be. Video Quality Is Amazing for something that Was Filmed In 1979. Let Me Tell You This Bluray Rocks lIKE Nothing Else You Will Find. This Is The Real Deal. This Is The Real AC/DC Not some Tribute Band With The Young Brothers And Some Other Singer If You Know What I Mean.Would Recommend This To Anyone Who Likes Real Rock And Roll. THIS IS A CONCERT! Just Wondering When More Bluerays With Bon Scott Are Going To Be Available Like The 1978 Show At The Apollo In Glasgow Scotland or The 1977 Show At Golders Green Or Rock Goes To College. Dont Know If The Film Of These Shows Is Able To Be Remastered But That Would Be Outstanding.Esepcially The Apollo Show Where They Recorded If You Want Blood The Live Album So I Know Sound Quality Would Be Great. Hopefully The Same Group Who Did This Blueray Will Consider This.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|This was a FANTASTIC interpretation of Gaskell's book - the screenwriters and producers did a masterful job of bringing this wonderful story to the screen and all I can say is BRAVO on the last scene - what a wonderful, wonderful realization of the book's ending. I loved, loved, loved it!!! Richard Armitage, Daniela Denby-Ashe and the entire cast were simply fantastic!! Armitage channeled Mr. Thornton masterfully and Sinead Cusack WAS Mrs. Thornton. Honestly, each of the actors owned their roles and made me believe - again, I can't say enough great things about this adaptation.

0756404738|5.0|I dare say this is even better than the first book.  I am absolutely in love with this.  I'm not even a big fan of fantasy, but this sucked me right in.  Definitely a must-read.  However, the wait for the third and final book will be UNBEARABLE.
B004A8ZX2S|1.0|Visually this is a fine film albeit no better than a trip to a great planetarium or certain IMAX films.  Otherwise, The Tree of Life is a pretentious and extremely feeble attempt to philosophize about everything from the creation of the universe to the interrelations in dysfunctional families, particularly the questionable and for the most part reprehensible treatment of children (even the \\"radiant\\" mother being a pathetic model).  One could learn more about these things by simply listening to the Mahler and Brahms works (and others)  offered as a sound palette to accompany the visual wonders.     The film leaves more questions about its creator and the actors who lent themselves to the project than it does to real feeling and intellectual or emotional depth.  What was Malick looking for?  Why did he choose the particular storyline he did and how does it illustrate universal concerns?  Why are there benevolent dinosaurs? Are nature and grace really so easily explained as we are told? Are we to think that all families experience these same alienations?  Where in the movie is there any real acting?  Who now are Pitt and Penn?  Why did we spend money on this film?
B003VNKNDW|5.0|I have another one of these but in the one gig, V30 version.  The Jet Flash 300 case is made of similar black plastic material.  There's nothing flimsy about the case.  Sure, if you try to crush the drive in a vice, it'll crush.  FWIW, you'd have to be trying to cause the flash drive case harm in order to break the case.<br /><br />The drive is pre-formatted and ready to go and was quickly and automatically recognized by the Win7/64 OS being used.  Although the drive states 16GB, when read by the computer, the computer claims 16,216,080,384 bytes of free space or 15.1 GB.  Not being a \\"total\\" computer geek, I can't explain the storage discrepancy.  It's pre-formatted FAT32.  The drive has a few GIF files and an exe file preloaded.  Don't know if I'm getting ripped or not in regard to storage capacity.  At a price of $27.42 for 15.1 GB's of usable storage (including two-day shipping) or $1.85/GB, to me, that's a screaming good deal.  Coming from the old school days of the TRS-80 and the first PC's, to have sixteen gigs of storage in my pocket for less than the price of a tank of gas is the stuff of science fiction as one can sure keep a lot of files on a flash drive of this size.  So personally, in today's terms, this drive, my opinion, is a screaming good deal.  In fact I liked it so much I bought one for my Father-In-Law to give his laptop a Flash Drive memory boost for Father's day.  So whether you're looking to buy a flash drive to give as a gift, store music, video, pictures or classroom notes, you won't be disappointed in this flash drive for either price or capacity.<br /><br />The only fly in the ointment when purchasing a drive of this kind is the unknown question; will this drive trash on you.  The answer to that question, nobody knows when a drive is going smoke their files as all anybody knows, one moment their files are there and the next moment their files are no longer accessible.  My suggestion, if you're worried about a flash drive trashing your files, buy two and keep the drive properly backed up. That's why \\"everybody\\" needs an active back-up plan and that's why we need to actively back-up our files.  When was the last time you backed up your HDD?<br /><br />Hope the above helps.

I believe most of them must have been watching a different movie. This movie is pure entertainment and the special effects are amazing, especially on OA. Personally, I was delighted to see some of the corps members rendered with such detail. As a fan of Green Lantern and the Corps I was very happy with this adaptation. It's not perfect and has the standard super hero origin story going on but this doesn't hold it back in my opinion. If you're a fan or someone who enjoys movies with adventure, humour and action then this is for you.

0853087563|5.0|A DETAILED, PRACTICAL GUIDE TO MATTERS OF EVIDENCE IN PI CASES<br /><br />An Appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />Personal injury, whatever its cause, can result in the widest spectrum of consequences, from mere inconvenience to the direst of personal tragedies.  Stephen Glynn's aptly titled `Guide to Evidence' is precisely that!  Published by Jordans under the auspices of APIL - the  Association of Personal Injury Lawyers- this clear, concise and authoritative text deals with virtually all aspects of evidence that are likely to pertain in personal injury claims.<br /><br />`Evidence,' as the author reminds us `forms the very foundation of any legal system and no claim can succeed at trial or before without sufficiently good evidence to support its constituent parts.'  This book, therefore, focuses on the rules of evidence, how to use evidence and what the court-imposed limits are in using evidence.<br /><br />`No properly advised Defendant is going to admit liability,' warns Glynn, `or make a decent offer is the evidence is not there, or cannot be used.'  Bearing in mind that the legal burden of proof lies with the Claimant in civil claims, including personal injury, there can be no proof - and therefore no successful claim without the evidence.<br /><br />As evidence is often regarded as an opaque subject, this lucidly written book will be warmly welcomed by practitioners, whether barristers or solicitors.  It's a crucial addition to the legal literature on evidence in general, and on evidence in PI claims in particular.  Logically structured in just over 250 pages for ease of use as a reference book, it lays out in plain language and in considerable detail, everything you need to know regarding evidence in PI cases, from liability investigations and medical records and examinations, to expert evidence, witness evidence, video and other evidence and quantum evidence.  Procedural steps, the role of Counsel and, of course, the trial itself are well covered, too.<br /><br />Written by a team of experts in this field -- both barristers and solicitors -- the book offers a wealth of practical advice, including tips on drafting, pleadings and schedules, as well as trial and appeals.  This new work presents an erudite as well as straightforward examination of this difficult area of law.  As you would expect, it contains extensive tables of cases, statutes and statutory instruments and there is a very useful index at the back.  Jordan Publishing refers to this guide as essential reading for all personal injury and clinical negligence practitioners, and we would certainly agree!re well covered, too.

1846612292|5.0|CRIMINAL SOLICITORS, BARRISTERS, THE JUDICIARY AND THE POLICE: A WEALTH OF PRACTICAL AND TACTICAL ADVICE ON ABUSE OF PROCESS<br /><br />An Appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />If it can be said of a Defendant in a criminal case that he cannot have a fair trial, or that it would  be unfair to try him, the matter of abuse of process suddenly looms as the most salient and important issue.  The subject is complex of course and very topical, (check out the chapter on adverse publicity), which is why this important book by Colin Wells has inevitably gone into a second edition, now published by Jordans.<br /><br />In collaboration with the other learned contributors, Paul Hynes QC, Carolyn Robson, Kris Gledhill and Nev Niyazi, Colin Wells of 25 Bedford Row, examines the concept of abuse of process and clearly explains the way it operates over an extremely wide range of circumstances within the criminal justice system.<br /><br />Quoting in broad terms, Article 6 (1) of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights (ECHR), he arrives at one of many definitions of abuse of process, namely that `...everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal'.  Quoting Lord Chief Justice Roger Ormrod, he later refers to `the power to stop a prosecution (which) arises only when it is an abuse of the process of the court....The ultimate objective of this discretionary power is to ensure that there should be a fair trial according to law, which involves fairness both the to the defendant and the prosecution.'<br /><br />Concepts, theories and definitions aside, this book is indeed an authoritative and accessible guide to the practicalities of how to make an application to stay proceedings if it can be shown that an abuse of process has taken place.  Such topics as, for example, the correct procedure pertaining to suspects detained at a police station and the disclosure of documents are covered, not to mention the preparation of cases generally, as well as the matter of delay, and a wealth of other issues.<br /><br />All recent changes to the law are cited in this new edition, including important judgments such as Mc E v Prison Service of Northern Ireland [2009] UKHL 15 and R v Hamza [2007]Crim LR 320.<br /><br />If you're professionally involved in this aspect of criminal law, you definitely need the latest edition of this definitive work.  To aid your further research, particularly when you are grappling with a case, there are at least 100 pages of appendices containing all the key materials you need, from the Attorney General's Guidance on Disclosure to the Code for Crown Prosecutors.  There are six skeleton arguments included, from Unfair Conduct and Non-availability of Evidence to Road Traffic Act which will be of great help to Counsel.<br /><br />With its useful resources section and extensive index, this valuable guide deserves pride of place in your professional library now it's in a second edition with the law as stated at January 2011.ed, not to mention the preparation of cases generally, as well as the matter of delay, and a wealth of other issues.

0765348276|4.0|Old Man's War, by John Scalzi, does a remarkable thing: it entertains and takes the reader into a complete and fascinating science fiction world, while at the same time addressing issues of humanity, how we determine our own identity, and the utility of war. This is the second book I have read by Scalzi, the other one being Fuzzy Nation, and I liked this one much more. Which is not to imply that I didn't like Fuzzy Nation. Because I did.<br /><br />Old Man's War follows a protagonist named John who starts the story as an old widower. In this world, elderly folks can sign up to join the Civil Defense Forces when they get old enough. The CDF goes about helping humanity secure new planets to colonize. John doesn't know exactly how they're going to make him young and tough again, but joining the CDF is something he and his wife, Kathy, planned to do when they hit the proper age. So with his wife gone, John decides to go ahead and join up on his own.<br /><br />Thus begins John's saga as he is put into a MUCH enhanced, younger and more soldierly version of himself. Comradeship, possible love, and lots of battle ensue. And in the meantime, science, or the fictional science at least of the book, drives much of what's going on in close combination with the characters.<br /><br />Scalzi's got a very clear voice. It's similar to Heinlein's, but more sardonic and snappy. There exist many more similarities between Old Man's War and much of Heinlein's work, say for example Starship Troopers. Indeed, there are clear homages to the master of the military science fiction novel in Scalzi's work.<br /><br />The characters and action of Old Man's War, kick the book along at a very nice pace, with dialogue keeping the pace snappy as well. Nice twists and plot turns keep the reader guessing, but not at the important stuff. John is going to be a hero because his vision of things and understanding of people give him a leg up. His loyalty and good heart endear the reader to John and we know that the fellow is going to survive against all odds, because Scalzi knows how to write an entertaining and satisfying novel.<br /><br />Scalzi's strengths are his dialogue and characters' voices, along with very well done plotting and, in the case of this novel, a robustly realized universe. Old Man's War is like a nicely done chocolate cake that isn't too rich but has a delicious and perfect layer or two of frosting. It's pleasant to look upon, very enjoyable to consume, and you (or at least I) can keep eating until it's all gone and still want more.<br /><br />The only critique I have is that the concept of 'skipping' needs to be somehow fleshed out more. Once you open the can of worms that is parallel universes, you either need to get that can under control fast or use the worms quickly, or you'll lose them.<br /><br />But considering the fact that I haven't read science fiction that engaged me from page one and kept me engrossed until I finished the book in years, that's a minor issue.<br /><br />I give it 4.5 out of 5 pens.<br /><br />Some deets: Plenty of salty language; they're in the infantry after all. Also, sex referred to, but not graphically by any means. Finally, plenty of violence, but it's mostly aliens.rvive against all odds, because Scalzi knows how to write an entertaining and satisfying novel.

B004EPYZUI|5.0|this is probably one of the best movies I have ever seen. I don't really like tons of action, but this was different. Most of the time action is so over-the-top and ridiculous that I can't stand it, but since all the action was actually imagined, it worked. I actually believed that babydoll believed she was fighting nazi zombies, dragons and robots.   Besides the action, the plot was original and insanely well developed. It was so intense. I loved how it was layered into multiple levels of reality, real-life insane asylum, the brothel that was imagined, and the fight scenes that were dreamed of also. At first I wasn't entirely sure what was real, but it was all cleared up in the end.  Anyone who says this movie has no plot was probably not paying attention. The CGI can be distracting, and Browning good looks may have diverted the attention of many also, but the story is strong and meaningful. I felt like crying after seeing this. How can someone do that to an innocent girl, and all for money? Oh and the soundtrack, without a doubt the best I've EVERRR heard.
1936719010|5.0|My husband suggested I read this book.  Let me rephrase that. He downloaded it on MY Kindle and recommended I read it.  Okay - he requested I read it.  \\"It's short.  You can read it fast,\\" he said.  My fast is not his fast.      I began reading and proved my comment to be one of truth.  Not because I was trudging through stupidity (as one reviewer commented) or drudging through meaningless insight (as another reviewer alluded to), but because I kept stopping to take notes (which Seth Godin suggests against doing the first read through).     Rather, I found this book extremely useful and quite helpful, even if at a simple level (which is often the best presentation for teaching).  It is a book on combatting the resistance that rears its ugly head whenever we start or are near to finishing something meaningful to us.   Some of you have learned to combat or master this monster, but for those of you (us) who haven't - you will find this little gem a worthwhile read that will empower you to keep on keeping on and finish the race (or 'project') you began.    Pressfield uses personal examples of his own failures in writing (which is the medium used as an example and can be translated to whatever the reader struggles with in terms of his/her own project). Throughout his book, Pressfield shows us the places in our projects where we get stuck and what it is that holds us back from finishing what we've started and HOW to overcome the walls that get in our way from reading the end.    Simple - yes.  Stupid - no.  It's a quick read, no brainer gem filled with treasures we so often forget and daily need to be reminded of.  Treasures we will want to carry in our back pocket and re-read over again, reminding ourselves they're not merely treasures   - they are truth.

0812550757|4.0|This book is the sequel to Ender's Game, and will have some spoilers for that book.  Ender's Game is an amazing book (as is this book) and both are highly recommended by me.    Characters    The main character in this book is Andrew (Ender) Wiggin who was the main character in Ender's Game.  In the 3,000 years since the end of the first book, Ender has traveled throughout the universe acting as a Speaker for the Dead.  As a Speaker, Ender goes to different planets to learn and speak the truth about those who have died.  He speaks without bias, and tells both the good and bad things that they have done in their lives.  The book also deals with several inhabitants of Lusitania, although Ender is the central figure in the story.  Of note among the other characters are Pipo, Libo, and Novinha, who are all scientists on Lusitania.  All of the characters were interesting, even if at the beginning it was difficult to tell Novinha's children apart.    Setting    Most of the book takes place on Lusitania, a planet that was found to be habitable by humans.  The planet is unusual as there is almost no genetic variability on the planet, there are very few species that exist on the planet.  However, one of these races, the pequeninos or piggies.  The piggies are an intelligent species and a large portion of the book is spent dealing with the piggies.  The worldbuilding in this book is brilliant, the piggies are amazingly unique as far as aliens go in books and Card does a wonderful job showing how they are different compared to humans.    Plot    As the humans had previously destroyed the only other intelligent race they met (the buggers from Ender's Game), they decided that the piggies must be left alone as much as possible.  Ultimately, when one of the humans is killed, they call for a Speaker for the Dead to commemorate his life.  Part of the genius of this book is that there are several different plots told at the same time.  There is Ender's storyline and his growth as a person, the story of the humans learning about the piggies, the history of the piggies, as well as how the galactic congress deals with the piggies as they deal with the humans.  All of the plots are done very well, and they interweave very well throughout the book.    Enjoyment    Between the brilliance of Ender's character, the excellent worldbuilding (especially when dealing with the piggies), and the multiple storylines told at the same time, this book is genius on several levels.  The book does a wonderful job of reversing many of the conflicts from Ender's Game.  Ender's game dealt with the possible extinction of the human race, this book is a much smaller scale for most of the story.  Ender's arc is flipped from the first book as well, in the first book he was separated from everyone, this book is about him coming back into society effectively.  All of the parts of the story are very well done.  My only complaint about the book (and this is what is keeping it from getting a 10) is that from time to time the characters revert to speaking in portuguese.  This irritated me as I don't think it worked within the story.  I think it was mostly there because Card knows some portuguese and decided to put it in a book that he wrote.    Overall Grade    The portuguese parts of the book were the only thing that kept it from being a 10.  This book is brilliant and Card is a wonderful author.    9/10    This and all of my reviews are available on my blog, check out the link in my profile to get there.
159514188X|5.0|The box outside his family home was addressed to Clay Jensen.  Inside are seven audiotapes with numbers on them.  Nothing else is inside.  He plays the first tape in which Hannah Baker starts musing about herself.  Hannah Baker committed suicide and on the tapes she recorded the Thirteen Reasons Why.  Each of the \\"Baker's dozen\\" on her list is to listen to the tapes before sending it on to the next culprit.  If someone fails to meet her terms, Hannah has a public backup plan to embarrass those who led her to kill herself.  Clay wonders why him as he was nice to her and she rejected him.  Still he listens trying to learn why him before he forwards the tapes to Jennifer.<br /><br />This is not an easy read for obvious reasons, but is handled deftly by Jay Asher.  The story line rotates between Hannah's telling her story and Clay's attempts to figure out why she added him in the mix with the others who were nasty to her.  Character driven, Thirteen Reasons Why makes a strong case for people to become involved especially with those who are down and need a friend; even if they reject your overtures try again and again for it takes a caring community to prevent the taking of one's life.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|A lot of books written by comedy writers and/or performers tend to read like a \\"joke book\\", more of a transcript of a stand up routine - this is not the case with this one. Yes, the book is hilarious, but that's because Tina Fey has a thought process that is so completely funny and twisted and real. There is nothing fake or forced about the humor; the book is funny because she is funny.

0062060554|5.0|At twenty-nine year of age Christine Lucas survived the car crash, but her ability to store short term memories was shattered.  She can only recall 24 hours and no more.  Dr. Nash recommends Chrissie keep a journal so she can scan what has recently happened, which she diligently maintains.<br /><br />Every morning she awakens as if her brain was an etch-o-sketch.  She has no idea who the man living with her is or if she has children.  When she looks in a mirror she sees a middle aged face not the youthful one her mind says.  Her journal and pictures on the mirror enable her to know the man is Ben her husband and that she is published novelist.  However, she wonders why Ben conceals truths from her and what Nash wants from her.<br /><br />Although there is an obvious connection to 50 First Dates, Before I Go To Sleep takes a much darker with no humor look at the loss of short term memory; making the story line more aligned with Memento but in a domestic setting.  Chrissie holds the plot together from her opening awakening in bed with a married man she fails to recognize and never slows down as she begins to question those who allegedly care about her.  Filled with twists, readers along with the beleaguered heroine will wonder why her loving husband hides truths from her.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
B004R15SIW|5.0|Inside Job did an excellent job at telling the story of the lead up to the 2008 financial crisis in the United States.  There were parts of the documentary that seemed overly dramatic (which the viewer could do without), but the overall detail and message are so important that the film deserves 10 stars.  This documentary should be required viewing for all Americans as the financial crisis is easily and thoroughly explained courtesy of the filmmakers and the many real life interviews with those in the financial industry.  What is truly sad (and may make you angry) is how the 2008 financial crisis was man-made, could have been avoided had our 'politcal elite' eschewed their greedy, transparent, dark side and the biggest offenders (from Presidents to CFO's... past and present) have gotten away with it.<br /><br />Inside Job is excellent and should be seen by all regardless of your political affiliation.

I also tried them out while watching a blue ray movie on my laptop (with stock sound card) and was blown away by what I was hearing!  The mic is also very adjustable and easy to move around.  Although I keep hearing myself breathing in the mic, I assume this is something I can fix, I just have not taken the time as of yet to figure it out.      If anything comes up on this after further use, then I will return and modify this review.  As of now, I am extremely happy with the sound, design, comfort, build, quality, and overall ease of use.
B004BC7MRM|5.0|After reading the reviews of this album, I have to say that I'm disappointed in those who criticize Kid Rock for changing his style.  Please remember that Kid Rock is now 40 years old, not 20 years old.  His focus in life has changed, so therefore, he chose to use this album to show a different side of himself.  Does this mean that he's not the same rocker as before? Of course not. I think this album actually shows that Kid Rock is quite diverse and is not limited to raunchy lyrics and drunken scenarios.  Don't get me wrong.  I jam with some of his old stuff; however, I find this album to be reflective of a more mature Kid Rock who has gone through trial, tribulation, as well as titillating fun.
B002SF9YNO|5.0|This video/movie is on a subject most people dislike discussing or even admitting that death exists.  It has layers within layers of life and death and treats each gently.  Watching the evolving life of this young man and his family brought forth many emotions of my own family and life.  But in such a sweet, gentle way that it was like remembering the aftertaste of a favorite dessert.  Wow, how can a story about death do that?  By treating death as a normal part of life and honoring the one who has transitioned with such dignity.  Perhaps not everyone is ready to watch this movie and see the same thing that I did, but I do recommend it for anyone who has lost a loved one.  There are some lessons to be learned from this movie.  I am glad it is on DVD so that I can watch it again and again.  Thank you.
0062060554|5.0|The story is about Christine, who has had an accident and is unable to form new memories. In addition to this, she has forgotten most of her adult life, and wakes up every day as a stranger in her own home.    Reading this story, I felt sadness and frustration. Both for Christine, and her husband Ben. I can't even imagine how horrible it would be to wake up every day and have no idea who you are, or what has happen during the past few decades. I think it would be equally as horrible to live with a person like that. To have to explain who you are, and who they are every day. I don't think I would have the patience.    I found Christine's character to be very real. She felt a gamut of emotions, and it seemed like you were privy to her version of life, feeling and living right along side her.    I didn't really believe the character of Dr Nash though. He seemed very cardboard-like, and just there. Not the professional you would think, or even like an obsessive researcher, which is how I think he is supposed to come off.    Overall, I was very impressed. I didn't guess the twist until right near the end, when everything started to come together. This was a very interesting, and at times, emotional read. Definitely worth checking out.
B004LWZW42|3.0|No Nightcrawler. No Storm. No Cyclops. No Rogue. No Gambit. And there's a noticeable lack of dignified old men like Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen.<br /><br />Yes, this is not the X-Men you're used to. \\"X-Men: First Class\\" goes back to the 1960s to tell the origin stories of both the X-Men and the Brotherhood of Mutants, as well as their charismatic leaders Professor X and Magneto. The story itself is a puff piece used to introduce the characters, but the performances by James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender are absolutely spellbinding.<br /><br />In the 1960s, a CIA sting operation discovers that the the cruel Sebastien Shaw (Kevin Bacon) (who is working with the Russians) also has a small group of superpowered mutants who can teleport, read minds, and so on. And the existence of mutants is proven to the government by mind-reading telepath Charles Xavier (McAvoy) and his foster sister Raven (Jennifer Lawrence).<br /><br />With Shaw planning to spark off a nuclear war between Russia and the US, Xavier begins gathering his own group of mutants -- including Erik Lensherr, a Holocaust survivor who is hell-bent on killing Shaw. The mutants begin training themselves so they can use their abilities to the fullest, but they may not be a match for Shaw... and even worse, Erik might be.<br /><br />\\"X-Men: First Class\\" as a pretty fluffy main plot, since its main purpose is to bring Erik and Charles together as best buddies... only to have them splinter off in two very different directions. Yes, there's a lot of stuff about the Cuban missile crisis and impending nuclear doom, but it feels like it's just a backdrop for the REAL drama.<br /><br />But it is a pretty fun popcorn movie, though not as powerful as the first two X-Men movies. There are some very striking moments (the FLYING SUBMARINE! Epic!), and some pretty impressive action scenes. However, director Matthew Vaughn really underplays some important scenes (such as Beast's transformation), and he really beats you over the head with the gay parallels of the mutants (\\"You didn't ask\\").<br /><br />As for the cast, the villains are pretty lackluster. Bacon gives a good performance, but he feels strangely out of place, as if he doesn't quite click into the story. And January Jones -- aka \\"sparkly Christmas ornament with breasts\\" -- gives a performance like garden tools scraping through a chalkboard. She is so annoying that she actually infects any scene she's in.<br /><br />But on the flipside, the protagonists are AMAZING. McAvoy and Fassbender are absolutely brilliant as two very similar men -- charismatic, intelligent, strong-willed -- who become fast friends, but are divided by their different views of human nature. Both actors really explore the bond between their characters, but you can see their differing beliefs slowly infecting it.<br /><br />As for the younger X-Men, they range from excellent (the adorable Nicholas Hoult) to horribly flat (Zoë Kravitz), but the one that disappointed me the most was Lawrence as the young Mystique. She's not bad, but she doesn't show the conflicted feelings and pain that she needed to.<br /><br />\\"X-Men: First Class\\" has a rather lightweight plot and some sketchy casting, but is saved by the presence of McAvoy and Fassbender.

0062060554|5.0|June 15th 2am 2011  I am writing this down, in my journal I must do this otherwise I fear tomorrow I might not remember anything. Anything about the book I read today or about me or my wife, well she says she is. I woke up this morning and my eyes were cast upon a striking beautiful woman in an even more striking body wearing nice lingerie that fits like a glove. I have no idea at that moment who she is, she says she's my wife but I don't remember being married! I am trying to piece together my life. All this is too much to muster I have been told I was in an accident I had fallen over an egg and banged my head. Strange but I don't remember this, this is what she my wife tells me. I need to write this in my oh so important journal otherwise I will run through the same routine again and not recollect her or the egg. Oh yes that book before I forget this book has inspired me to write more into this journal as the female protagonist is in same situation as me. Her story is ever so more gripping, its tense I am almost glued to the pages her quest is heart warming and heartbreaking I felt tears of joy and sadness on the completion of her story. The story is in the first-person narrative and flows in a visceral fashion. They say it can be cured what we have if we piece together our past and write, I hope so. The story was something fresh and different well worth the read. When I wake up tomorrow I must remember on reading this journal  that I have to share these thoughts and write a review.  goodreads.com/loupendegrast
B004EPZ07K|2.0|I honestly didn't know a lot about the Green Lantern before this movie, since he's not nearly as well known as Spiderman, Superman or Batman. And, well, the &#34;Green Lantern&#34; movie isn't really the best way for the public to be introduced to him -- it's thinly-plotted, with a forgettable female lead and a barrage of flashy, splashy CGI.<br /><br />Fighter pilot Hal Jordan (Ryan Reynolds) is suddenly abducted by a ball of green energy, and deposited next to a dying alien who gives him a ring and a green lantern. Before you can say &#34;it's not easy being green,&#34; he's zapped off to an alien planet called Oa, where the Green Lantern Corps is headquartered.<br /><br />What is the Green Lantern Corps? Well, they're an intergalactic force for good, who rely on the green energy of WILLPOWER (just roll with it), and are able to use their rings to fly, fire energy blasts, and make anything they can imagine. And the Corps wastes no time in training Hal in his ring's use, although their leader Sinestro (Mark Strong) doesn't think he's up to the job.<br /><br />However, it turns out that the dead Green Lantern was killed by Parallax, a vast malevolent creature feeding off the yellow energy of fear -- and it's also infected a mousy scientist (Peter Sarsgaard), who goes on a rampage. Now Hal must somehow overcome his own fears, or the entire Earth will be destroyed by Parallax.<br /><br />The Cinema Snob said that this felt like the pilot for a Green Lantern TV show, and I have to agree with him -- it's basically all an origin story for the Green Lantern, and everything else is basically secondary to Hal Jordan becoming a superhero and proving himself. It's not horrible, but it failed to thrill me as an epic superhero movie should.<br /><br />So for most of the running time, Martin Campbell tries to dazzle us with flashy action sequences (a dogfight with AI fighter jets) and vast expanses of glitzy special effects (the glimmering emerald cities of Oa). The plot is pretty thin and straightforward, with no real twists or surprises -- about ten minutes in, you can easily predict everything that will happen after that. Seriously, four writers worked on this?<br /><br />And yes, I found it VERY distracting that Parallax looks like a giant cosmic diarrhea attack. I am not kidding -- he looks like Sauron's poo.<br /><br />Ryan Reynolds is.... passable. He doesn't seem like he's trying very hard during the more dramatic scenes, but he's pretty good when Hal is being goofy (&#34;To infinity and beyond!&#34;) or kicking butt. And Mark Strong and Peter Sarsgaard give excellent performances as a suspicious military leader and a big-brained scientist-turned-megalomaniac.<br /><br />But Blake Lively as the token love interest? She's not only completely nondescript and bland, but totally devoid of chemistry with Reynolds. She literally looks like his much younger sister.<br /><br />&#34;Green Lantern&#34; does a decent job introducing us to the world of the Green Lantern Corps, but the plot is so thin and predictable that it really doesn't do the concept justice.

B003M6EAXM|5.0|Jack and the gang hit another home run in the eighth season. What can I say, they just keep the intrigue high, the story moving fast and furious, the writing excellent, and the acting superb! They have wonderful special effects, and Keifer Sutherland is the absolute perfect actor to play Jack!
0525422943|4.0|I won't go into much detail about the book. If you haven't read the first one, you must read it first. This one is all Adam's perspective. He is a successful musician, and he and Mia are no longer together.<br />This was a pretty good story, but it wasn't nearly as good as If I Stay. The ending of this one wasn't necessarily what I expected, and it wasn't very dramatic at all. I would have rather the first one been a stand alone so that I could imagine what happened to them both. It was sad seeing Adam in the state he is in. So overall, it was a good story, but I would have been just as happy having only the first book and my imagination.
0064400557|5.0|It's a classic. It has become part of an American childhood. Every American child will read it and probably go over it in school. Every American child should own it.
B004EPZ07K|5.0|Green Lantern has one of the best balances between serious and humor that most any movie has, especially superhero movies. Movies based off of superheroes seem to think in order to look real they must have everyone unhappy, serious all the time, and often self hating. Green Lantern had a great deal of fun while taking on a great evil in the universe.     Green Lantern also stayed very true to it's comic origins with the passing of Abin Sur's ring to Hal Jordan, his relationship with Carol Feris, the appearance of Planet Oa, the members of the GL Corps, and the Guardians were amazing. Sinestro was by far one of the best characters in the entire movie, like he walked right out of the comics.    Anyone that can't like this movie just doesn't know how to enjoy a movie.
B003UESJHO|4.0|yeah, you know, i'm not so sure that this film is as 'predictable' as lots of  previous commenters have suggested. the awfulness of life permeates this film up until the last 15 minutes.  it's real, you know, so unless you want the film to be unreal, then give up the 'predictable' comments.    i have to say, christian bale--an actor i kinda found repugnant up till this film--was incredible. he was so trippy; uneven: uncomfortable to watch. he totally rocked. i mean, the dude in real life  reeks of  'pretty boy'. in this film: notsomuch.    and wahlberg (sp?)  you rocked it too!  i totally felt the conflictions your character was  dealing with---you deserve as much credit as bale got; oh-so-subtle but incredibly effective.    thanks for some incredibly ugly, redemptive stuff!
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Game runs but plants and zombies don't show up. Probably a resolution or graphics problem. Yet another half assed port of an iphone game.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Plants vs Zombies is a very entertaining and challenging game. Each level is a little different and requires a unique strategy to conquer. My only complaints are that it tends to make my Droid X run hot and that it drains the battery quickly. So, don't. play too many levels at once and keep in mind that you may have to recharge your phone when finished playing.

B002ZG98C8|4.0|One of my favorite part of Robert Rodriguez's DVDs are his extra features, so I decided to rent it through Redbox first and purchase the feature-packed version when it comes out.    This film reminded me of his El Mariachi film which he shot with the $7,000 that he made from working in a drug research lab as guinea pig.  The plot is a simply goodguy/badguy storyline that we find in most drama/action films.  It has the same B movie and exploitation style of Grindhouse.
B004A8ZX2I|2.0|Here's how far we've come in some fifty years:<br /><br />The plot of \\"Unknown\\" may or may not have proven adequate for a half-hour episode of The Twilight Zone. That episode may or may not have begun with Rod Serling telling us \\"Submitted for your approval. What is a man but his memories...\\" and gone on to dazzle and charm a few suburban families for 20+ minutes. Today, this selfsame, threadbare kernel of a plot that would have to stretch to the breaking point to span 20 minutes has somehow received the approval to extract a 113 minute chunk from your life. Padded with innumerable and now requisite car crashes, chases, shootings, injections and generally improbable -- though incredibly well-timed -- miscues by the bad guys (or, Or, ORRRRR: are they good guys?) \\"Unknown\\" is actually quite knowable thanks to its obvious, clich&eacute; machinations. Why did I watch it, you ask? I was on an airplane. A 12-hour flight made sadly even longer by the steady stream of dumb dripping off that tiny little screen and onto my trouser legs... Wow, do I hate flying.
B00544L9EI|5.0|I'll be honest, I thought this album was going to suck. Especially since it wasn't advertised well. It's not one song on this album that I DON'T like, and I must say that it feels GREAT to have the old Em back that we're all use to. They both go hard thoughout the album so it's tough figuring out who has the best verses on every song. CLASSIC!
0143038583|5.0|This book completely changed my way of thinking about food. I've always been very interested in the consequences of our food choices, but Pollan took me several steps further into that process. Pollan didn't write this book to convince anyone of anything, and I really appreciate that. Instead, it represents his own search for the truth and meaning behind our daily bread, and as we travel with him, our own search. There are no clear answers, no absolute rules to adhere to, and Michael Pollan fully respects that.    When I read this book, I couldn't help but telling people what I learned, and saying \\"You've really got to read this.\\" On so many levels... It's a fascinating and utterly compelling read on the one hand, and full of things you want everyone to think about on the other hand.

I use it right away when turning on the phone, as it automatically runs a long list of apps I don't even use, then I run it as needed.
1608870081|4.0|It uses actual movie stills and makes them three dimensional. I thought the book was very cool. Would have like there to be more scenes.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|The book is waaaaay too big to make into a movie without leaving out some serious amounts of story, so they split it into two parts, which was a wise decision.<br /><br />I've worked on some movies, and the ideal length of book to make into a movie is really a novelette. Anything longer, and you have to cut a lot out.<br /><br />This movie is very true to the first half of the book, and I'm delighted that they managed to cram in as much as they did.<br /><br />It's all at least as well done as the rest of the series, in other words, superlative, and I'm very happy with it.
B00001U0DP|1.0|Maybe my husband and I are too old and jaded, but we couldn't watch more than the first 20 minutes of this movie.    We liked the costumes, make-up, scenery, etc., but the actor playing the main character is way too self indulgent for our tastes.    We're both fluent in italian.  I wonder if someone watching it with subtitles will have better luck liking this film.    It has over 600 positive reviews here.  I'm shocked!
B003Y3BMFW|5.0|(This review is for the deluxe version (2CD/1DVD) but not the ultra deluxe version with the vinyl.)    When I saw that all of the songs on this were off their albums/EPs except for one soundtrack song (\\"Birth Ritual\\" from \\"Singles Sdtk\\") and the one new song, \\"Black Rain\\" I admit that I was pretty disappointed as a Soundgarden fan.  It seemed like they were making you buy a whole greatest hits package for one new song.  I thought \\"weren't these guys supposed to be against this kind of crap?\\".      I already own nearly all of their albums so it seemed like a waste of money to me to buy this one but I was still VERY curious to hear \\"Black Rain\\".  So OK, I justified buying this because I figured at the price point it was worth it for the DVD alone and \\"Black Rain\\" was a bonus.  There were a few tracks I hadn't heard since I don't have the \\"Singles Soundtrack\\" or \\"Screaming Life/Fopp\\" yet (though I was and still am planning to add them to my collection before long).      Well, from the very first track I realized this is NOT a collection of stuff strictly from their albums.  The version of \\"All Your Lies\\" on here is quite different from the version on \\"Ultramega OK\\".  The version on here is apparently from the Deep Six compilation (I guess that one's now fairly rare/pricey) and it has a much more \\"New Wave\\" vibe to it than anything I've ever heard from Soundgarden (though it doesn't surprise me TOO much to hear them sound that way - they did do at least one Devo cover that I'm aware of).      That was my first clue that this collection was more than I had supposed it to be.  It turns out that there are something like 8 or 9 of the 24 tracks that are either live or alternate versions of the same tracks that appear on their albums.  Between that and the few tracks from the couple of releases of theirs that I don't have yet, there was around half of this collection that ended up being completely new stuff to my ears!!!  And in my opinion, all of this \\"new\\" stuff rocks!\\"Black Rain\\" rocks!    The DVD rocks!  I grew up without MTV so this was the first time I'd seen almost any of their music videos.  And if I had grown up with MTV I can only imagine it would have probably been even more cool to finally get their complete music video collection for nostalgia reasons.    The artwork is awesome!  I kept reading that people said the artwork was great and I kept thinking \\"who the hell buys a CD of songs they already own just because it has a new picture on the cover\\".  Well, if that's all you got here I'd still think that way but what you really get is a great collection of stuff that there's a good chance you don't already have AND they went to the trouble of giving you some awesome artwork too!  Telephantasm is truly a \\"whole package\\" deal.    I now realize they did just about everything humanly possible to make this collection appeal to pretty much ALL Soundgarden fan.  The casual fan or newbie gets a great \\"best of\\" package with some rarities and a DVD!  The diehard fan gets some great rarities and alternate versions of some of their favorites along with the first new Soundgarden track in 15 years AND A FREAKIN' DVD!      So I went from total skeptic to someone who would easily recommend this to just about any Soundgarden fan, even the ones who already have all of their albums.  Well done Soundgarden!  Thanks for not letting your fans down!    Can't wait to hear their new album when it comes out.
B004EPYZQ2|1.0|...that rate a product before it is even available!   What lots of idiots do not understand is that if they want to rate the movie they should go to IMDB.com.   If they want to rate the DVD or blu-ray they have to wait until it is available and they have tried it out.   How do they know what the video and audio quality is going to be?   The packaging, the extras etc.?  Of course ultimately it is Amazon's fault for allowing reviews of a non-existing product.    So once again, for all the mentally slow people, DVDs and blu-ray discs are *products* an important *part* of which is the movie and/or TV episodes on it and their quality but that is far from being the *only* criterion by which they should be judged!   Ergo, you actually need to have experienced the product before you can rate it!
0439023521|5.0|You read the blurb of a book or see a movie preview & you think that it will be really good what a great idea, but after it's over you're completely disappointed at the wasted potential.  Thankfully Collins does not fall into this trap, she really makes the most of a great idea and delivers a tense, exciting & gripping novel.  Just as the Harry Potter books are enjoyed by adults & kids, so will this. With the movie due out shortly this stunningly entertaining book is destined to be a classic.
1416583432|1.0|Had I known that this New York Times Bestseller was written by a scientist I would never have purchased it. In my opinions scientists have very little ability at communicating with the \\"common\\" man/woman.This should have been titled the science of dogs. It is not a pleasant read nor does it read easily. I have a better than average IQ but seriously I was struggling to make any sense out of the author's incessant drivel.    I am not interested in the history of dogs and how they evolved from wolves. I was interested in getting inside the brain of my dogs to see why they act one way at home and yet another at the dog park.The author may at one stage in the book been able to help me but seriously after perservering with the twelve page prelude( thinking that surely once inside the body of the book, it would become more entertaining)I gave up after 2 pages into chapter one.    I would suggest that all scientists that write books about common everyday subjects, to get a non-scientific person to proofread the book first.    I am very disappointed in this book.

B00004TEUX|5.0|This CD features what is almost certainly the greatest recorded performance of Mendelssohn's best symphony, the Symphony No. 3, \\"Scottish.\\" Although eclipsed in popularity by the \\"Italian Symphony,\\" the Scottish Symphony is the most mature symphonic statement by Mendelssohn and the last symphony he completed, in 1842 (despite being no. 3 of 5!). Peter Maag's 1960 performance with the London Symphony Orchestra has long been regarded as the \\"reference\\" performance of this work: Maag simply got everything right here, from tempos (always spot-on), clarity of textures, the right atmosphere and an overriding sense of excitement and discovery at every turn. Pay special attention to how Maag handles the coda at the finale of the symphony, with the horns blaring out with such power and clarity. I have yet to hear a performance which surpasses Maag's, including his own digital remakes with a Spanish orchestra. The sound quality is absolutely great for its time and in this 24/96 remastering it sounds better than ever before.    The second half of the disc contains what many regard as Mendelssohn's greatest work: his Overture and Incidental Music to A Midsummer Night's Dream. The Overture, written when Mendelssohn was a teenager is a delightful and joyous work and it is admirably complemented by the music he later wrote to accompany Shakespeare's play. The tracks featured here include all the best numbers, leaving out only the repetitious movements. Each and every moment of this music features something we do not normally associate with the German repertoire: color. Maag ensures that the maximum amount of color is drawn out of each movement, which makes his performance eclipse even Szell's virtuosic but dryer Cleveland performance of many of these movements on Sony. Although recorded three years earlier than the Scottish Symphony, Maag's Midsummer still features first-rate sound, again given excellent remastering here.    In my opinion, this CD contains Mendelssohn's two greatest compositions: his best symphony and one of the most beloved of all \\"incidental music\\" ever composed (his Violin Concerto is a very close third favorite of all Mendelssohn compositions). The performances of these two works featured here are also the greatest performances of these works ever committed to disc (at least to my ears). At slightly under 80 minutes, this CD is also very generous. Don't hesitate to grab this CD before it goes out of print!
B0032UYFA6|5.0|As much as I like this show, it's the sort of drama that throws into sharp relief the difficulties in telling plausible character-driven (as opposed to plot-driven) stories. The writers have the sense to avoid \\"on the nose\\" dialog that tells us what the characters are thinking (especially their motivations), but this leads to occasional confusion as to What, Exactly, Is Going On, And Why? There is also some out-of-character dialog, such as Jesse making profound and subtle remarks, and Hank not being his usual doofus self, for no good reason.<br /><br />Skyler remains the principal villain of the piece. She is repeatedly called a b**** -- which she is -- and Goodman even says he doesn't understand why she and Walter ever married. She finally starts supporting Walter -- but principally for financial reasons.<br /><br />The logical and scientific errors continue. The Doublemint Twins are Really Bad Shots, and it's not likely metalized balloons could blow a transformer. Fortunately, \\"Breaking Bad\\" continues stealing scenes from other films -- in this series, \\"Ratatouille\\" and \\"The Court Jester\\". (Really.) I don't know whether the reference to a famous work by Milhaud is intentional, though.<br /><br />By the end of the season, the plotting gets nicely complex, and most of the complexity derives from the characters' personalities (rather than writers' room brainstorming).<br /><br />\\"Breaking Bad\\" is classy soap opera (or should I say, the organic salt of a fatty acid opera?) and, as such, is extremely entertaining.
B004WJREPO|5.0|It was worth it for me since I wanted all the outtakes and uncut versions (crazy as it may seem)! Nice photos: alternate album cover photos, the tape boxes, instruments used on each track, video behind the scenes shots, various studio shots of the gear used and instuments. Screen captures of the videos is kind of unecessary as the videos are on the DVD. Nice interviews in print. DVD is pretty good with the videos and the vintage interview with Macca - hadn't seen that before.<br /><br />All in all, very nice to have it all in a book form. Finally found out that the orchestration for Blue Sway was done in 1986 when Cold Cuts was still in the works. He says he worked on orchestrations for 14 tracks, so, who knows what's still in the can?<br /><br />The outtakes are remixed and sound better than the bootlegs out there. The only thing that appeared edited was Bogey Wobble, which is about 20 seconds shorter. Comparing it to the boot, it looks like the intro was trimmed slightly (no great loss there)! Mr H Atom remix makes it a tad more listenable, too. Wonderful Christmastime is maybe 30 seconds longer. I still like the longer versions of Coming Up and Darkroom.
0345529057|5.0|This is purely a review of the work itself and not the packaging. I personally recommend getting all four at once and going at it. (Buy the fifth too!) To my mind, Martin is the first author in his genre to exceed the innovations and uniqueness of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings series, bringing the fantasy genre completely up to date, extending the milieu, characterization, cultural complexity and presentation far beyond his rightly esteemed predecessor. Spoilers ahead: essentially, where Tolkien is black-and-white, Martin deals in shades of grey. His books are sexually explicit. The High Middle Ages milieu is carefully rendered, complicated, violent bordering on anarchy, and almost pitilessly realistic. He shows no compunction in killing off main or major characters. (This is one of the things I like most about him.) Magic and magical creatures are sparsely deployed, especially in the first volume, and when appearing can be rather repellent in their actuality. There are no Gandalf-figures in this series. There is none of the Dungeons & Dragons atmosphere so prevalent in popular fantasy genre books. By the middle of the fourth book, the main continent of the series, Westeros, is pretty much a wreck and most of the major characters are dead or missing. (This is a major letdown for many readers.)<br /><br />Book 1 - A Game of Thrones: sets up many threads and trends for the later books, introduces many characters, some of which make it to the fourth book. Some characters and medieval powers seem to be set up as the Forces For Good, and others as the Forces For Bad. The entire book is gripping and fascinating, and gives serious indications of the unpredictableness to come.<br /><br />Book 2 - A Clash of Kings: The series takes flight in this book. There is no other way for me to put it - you simply will not be able to put this book down. You will bounce around between a dozen or so main characters and meet so many other major figures peopling each section, and yet the sense of constant movement and engagement with all characters is unceasing. Great suspense is built as the monsters beyond the Wall continue to threaten, and the Black Brothers resolve to confront the threat. A unifying king dies and armies march.<br /><br />Book 3 - Storm of Swords: Ditto with the third book. Un-put-down-able. Climactic battles take place at the Wall, and in Westeros, and in the keep at King's Landing. Here it is completely clear that the \\"side\\" previously considered the 'good guys' - the Wolf forces superficially headed by the Stark clan - are just as bloody-minded and warlike as the Lion forces headed by the Lannisters. Some very ugly events take place in this book, but they are never less than utterly gripping for the reader. By the time this book ends, you will be on a trembling edge of eagerness for the fourth book and What Comes Next.<br /><br />Book 4 - Feast For Crows: Widely considered a letdown, and to some extent it is, since the only really sympathetic character turns out to be Jaime Lannister, other than Samwell, who is almost unmistakably the authorial alter ego. The continent, as I noted, is pretty much wrecked except for the southern reaches of Highgarden and Dorne. An island nation suddenly becomes far more aggressive. The dwarf disappears. The dragon queen makes no appearance. The character of Brienne takes up far too much space in this book, only to meet a very ugly end. Poor Arya hides out in Braavos. Nevertheless, this book takes off again in the last 300 pages or so and ends in an uptempo fashion, with Jaime cleverly resolving a siege and another depth-charge detonation of a major character, also with a very clever change in fortunes for the tragic Sansa. Setting things up very well for the fifth book, forthcoming a few weeks after this review was written!<br /><br />Tolkien is great and I love him and his books. Nevertheless, it was time for someone to come along and surpass him. I think Martin innovates in this genre to such anextent that even when he takes risks that don't work, as much of Book 4 does, it's still worth reading and and when it does work, as it does pretty much all the time otherwise, the series transcends genre literature. He breaks out of the D&D concept completely and makes a fascinating real-world concept out of something that seemed impossible. These books will be remembered for a long time.that don't work, as much of Book 4 does, it's still worth reading and and when it does work, as it does pretty much all the time otherwise, the series transcends genre literature.

B004IFYMWK|5.0|I had read the book and had followed the news so I was not too unfamiliar with the event. My teenager got to watch the DVD and only then learned about it. I was glad he paid attention, and wanted to know more about it. Thanks for making the movie available.
B0041KKYBA|4.0|Fantastic movie overall, excellent review of what happened with the GFC.  Last 30mins however I thought was woeful. Does not go into the further mistakes of Bernake of QE1 & QE2. Fails to mention that there really has been no economic recovery and that mistakes by governing bodies and Investment banks continue.
B0000CBHOI|5.0|It comes down to what you might be looking for. If you want a concert, if you want a documentary of one of the particular \\"blues gods,\\" this might be too overwhelming for you. It has numerous discs, yes. It is quite long, yes.  But that is because it's a chronology of this music. It follows not only the music itself but the foundations of it: The social history. It shows what the music is about. If you are looking to see B.B. King play his famous style of guitar, it's here. But there are scenes that discuss what his life was like before he ever played. It discusses social unrest, poverty, even slavery. One of the best discs here involves a narrator taking a trip to western Africa, studying the music there and how it relates to what we now call the blues, talking to and playing with African musicians who don't even speak English. Later discs show what Robert Johnson's life was like before he made his classic recordings in the 1930's. You get to see all the other main men, like Buddy Guy, Willie Dixon, Muddy Waters, all of them. You get to see actual interviews with most of them.  And, later, you see Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, and others talking about what they felt like to first hear this music form, how and why they started, what kept them dedicated to learning it.<br /><br />And the music? Is there live, loud, clear sounding blues? YES! You bet your you-know-what there is. It is here, and it is hot. It's just not all concentrated at once. You don't get to see all the great blues guys on the same stage during the entire thing. If that is what you're looking for, you might want to get one of the Eric Clapton \\"Crossroads\\" videos. They are great, and he still makes them every year with the latest players. This goes deeper... This shows you not only the music itself but the social fabric that created it and allowed it to grow through all those past generations. ENJOY!
0739432141|5.0|Such a great book, Morgan doesn't hold back when it comes to the vicious truths about life. Having read it before, I wanted a hardcopy for myself so I could share it with my friends and family. Sex, Drugs, Violence, this book has it all. And even if that isn't for you, the complexities of the questions that eternal life brings up is enough for me. this is up there with some of the best science fiction I have ever read.
B0001JXQDI|3.0|nobody else gave it 3 stars- take this for what its worth Ive listened to this at least a half dozen times, couldnt tell you 1 song on it, but after a day of working in hell I enjoyed putting it on and relaxing
B001NXDIMK|4.0|Season One was enthralling: the acting was spot on; the writing was deft; the characters entrancing, albeit malignant; and the plots were Machiavellian and Byzantine. Season Two has much to recommend it; Glenn Close is still brilliant as Patty, and William Hurt introduces a fascinating and dark new character. There is one serious flaw in my view. Who the hell told Timothy Olyphant he can act? His entire range has three expressions: concerned furrowed brow, thoughtful squint, and earnest clinched teeth. The character may be okay, but please God, get somebody who can show more depth!
B0051QO4QY|5.0|GaGa has a lot to live up to.  Poker Face and Bad Romance are once in a lifetime songs.  Born This Way the single comes very close.  If you expect every song to be like those, you will likely be disappointed. But once you listen to this album several times, you realize the new direction she has taken.  Her hallmark dance beats and in-your face lyrics are influenced this time by the 80s.  Hence, why people thought Madonna's Express Yourself sounded like Born This Way.  They share an arrangement style--though it's far from the same melody.  GaGa also has more between the lines under her usual in your face.  For example, Government Hooker is really about JFK and Marilyn, but it takes some a while to figure that out.  As the album progresses, her sound becomes increasing influenced by the 80s.  She even throws in some county influenced arrangements (You and I) and if you bought the deluxe edition, a country-influenced Born This Way.  I like the whole album, but if I'm pressed for time I favor the following: Marry the Night, Born This Way, Judas, Government Hooker, Hair, Sheise,The Edge of Glory, Highway Unicorn, and Americano.  If I lhave a little more time, well, i just play as many as I can. It just grows on you.  For example, at first I thought Hair was silly, but now it is one of my absolute favorites.  Yes, I want to be as free as my hair.  When you have big hair, it's easy to understand what she means.  Love her.
B003IKMR0U|3.0|I got this for my nine year old son figuring it would make for some good family gaming. The rules are simple to learn and have just a trace of strategy to keep it from being a game of pure luck. The theme is well done with the artwork on the instructions, dice, and packaging all excellent.     In fact it's not a bad game at all. However I am calling this a novelty in my review and the reason for the three stars is it has very little replay value. It's fun a few times and then, at least in our family, it wasn't picked up again. There are lots of simple games that are played over and over again, but not this one.     Steve Jackson Games makes many great games; I've been a customer for years. Zombie Dice though, just doesn't have enough replay value to be more than a one day novelty. Maybe buy it for your Halloween party or other one time event and it's fine for that, but this game won't be the centerpiece of a family game night like many classics might be.
0316098329|3.0|\\"When all is said the greatest action is to limit and isolate one's self.\\"  -- Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe\\"    \\"The smaller the world, the more complete the knowledge of the writer, therefore the greater his creative choices.\\"  --- Robert McKee, Story    \\"Now I'm in Outside but it turns out lots of it isn't real at all.\\"  --- Jack from Room    I really wanted to like this book.  The premise, the ambitious POV, it was all very enticing.  But, alas, as is so often the case - it doesn't quite deliver on its promise.    Plot-wise it is pretty standard fare, following the journey of Prisoner, Escape, Real World, Adjustment Pains, Epiphany, etc. (you even get the classic insensitive foster mom!)  It may have been more interesting if they'd failed to escape and instead fell into a psychosis, the narrative becoming more and more surreal.  In that sense - being severely limited gives you limitless imagination.      Another unexplored dynamic and something that could've really catapulted this story to the ranks of Timeless is: How does a Mother who's been raped deal with seeing the features of the rapist on her child? Is not the child, in a psychological sense, also a rapist?  Wouldn't the Mother start to unravel or at least be conflicted, especially since she's a prisoner?  To have witnessed this from the child's POV would've been truly something.  Too bad it's left on the back burner.    The first 100 pages are what Jack and his Mom do in the Room to occupy the time.  They play the same games over and over, read the same books over and over and cook and eat and look at skylight and cook and eat and really I don't think you need 100 pages of that.  Half would've more than sufficed to get the monotony of their routine.      Then there's Jack's inability to understand figures of speech, e.g. -    The Mom: \\"I think I'm losing my mind.\\"  Jack: \\"It's right here.\\"  I tap on her hair.      The Mom: \\"If he's the least bit human...\\"  Jack: Then what are his other bits?    And so on.It's cute, but gets old (and annoying) pretty quickly.   Again, less would've been better.  Though occasionally the boy does say some trenchant things, like the quote above and this bit on p. 287 (which is my favorite):    \\"I guess the time gets spread very thin like butter over all the world, the roads and houses and playgrounds and stores, so there's only a little smear of time on each place, then everyone has to hurry on to the next bit.\\"    I also thought \\"scave\\" was a cool invention, a blending of scared and brave.  \\"Scare is what you're feeling.  But brave is what you're doing.\\"    But these are the highlights.  Most of the book feels repetitive and predictable.  And the escape plan was totally crazy (see my \\"Spoiler Alert\\" at the bottom).      This is one of those books that could've been a true classic but falls short because it opts for plot convenience and narrative ease.  Donoghue could've limited herself even more - give Jack and Mom no TV, no skylight, no access to the sun (as was the case with the real-life Fritz children) and see how the boy would've made sense of the Outside then.  Would've been more interesting, much more of a shock, surreal, etc.  Again, a lot of potential here that wasn't fully mined.    I give it three stars for its attempt at a unique POV.    ***SPOILER ALERT***  I found the mom's plan for escape to be unbelievably far-fetched, certain to fail.   There were so many things that could've (and should've) gone wrong.  First off, the Outside would be so disorientating to Jack he would've very likely gotten confused and unable to carry out the plan.  Second, Old Nick would've treated him roughly, hauling him around, dumping the rug he was in onto cement or whatnot.   I could go on.  But once you read it I think you'll know what I mean.  Again, another too convenient device.

B002ZG980U|4.0|I just watched Inception and right away it reminded me of Dreamscape, where people could enter other people's dreams and help them defeat scarey monsters or kill them off in their sleep.  Inception, though, is on a much higher (albeit \\"lower\\" level) going through 4 (5?) consciousness states.  I found I had to consciously keep reminding myself which level of consciousness I was watching so I wouldn't get too lost. I think the trick to watching this movie is to let it carry you away and don't fight it. I found it extremely cerebral, initially, but in the end it's actually quite simple.  That's the genius of the movie - it is both complicated and simple.  The acting is first rate but that's really not as important as how the movie plays out. I gave it 4 stars because it's one of those movies I call \\"a lot of work\\".....watched it one time, and it's still with me, but not sure I'd want to go through it all over again.  And I rewatch A LOT of movies but every once in awhile, there's a movie that's \\"a lot of work\\"....this one is worth watching, at least one time.....
1582406723|5.0|This comic was just wonderful.  I have been reading comics for about 15 years now and I've read some real stink bombs, but this is by far the best zombie comic I have ever read.<br /><br />The main character is Rick Grimes, your average small town cop that you see every day when you drive to work, or when you're walking around town.  He's a simple family man with a wife and a son and a job that he excels at.  He has his partner Shane who has stuck by him through thick and thin, who is not only his partner, but is also his best friend.<br /><br />Rick is injured in a gunfight and is in the hospital stuck in a coma while the world falls apart.  He finally regains consciousness only to find that the dead now rule the earth.  Rick moves heaven and Earth to find out what happened to his family and to be re-united with them.<br /><br />I love how this book didn't explain how the dead started to rise, and no one is asking about it.  It has always been my personal opinion that if zombies did start to rise, you'd be too scared to ask these questions.  You'd be too worried about keeping yourself and your family alive, getting food, staying safe and in one piece to ask these questions or to really investigate what happened to cause all this.<br /><br />If you're a fan of zombies, or if you like the TV series of the Walking Dead, or if you're  a comic book fan, check this out!  There will probably never be another comic about zombies that could possibly top this series!

B004VFYPTW|5.0|Finally one of the most requested recordings in hard rock gets an official release in June 2011 by \\"Frontiers Records\\". This is arguably \\"Whitesnake\\" at the peak of their international popularity headlining the \\"Monsters of rock\\" festival in the UK with the legendary line up of David Coverdale (v), Andrian Vandenberg (g), Steve Vai (g), Rudy Sarzo (b) and Tommy Aldridge (d).<br /><br />BACKGROUND OF WHITESNAKE AT DONNINGTON<br /><br />This 2CD plus DVD set is a perfect documentation of \\"Whitesnake\\"s headline performance at the \\"Monster of Rock 1990\\" festival at Donnington, England. \\"Whitesnake\\" had previously performed at \\"Monsters of Rock\\" in 1980 and 1983-at which time they also headlined and shot a live video for a domestic release entitled \\"Whitesnake Commandos\\".<br /><br />THE RECORDINGS AND SURROUNDING CIRCUMSTANCES<br /><br />It has to be addressed that the recordings of audio and video were NEVER intended to serve for a commercial release. The audio was recorded and transmitted live by the BBC radio; the video served as real-time footage for the large video-walls of the event so that all 75.000 people could have a decent view of what was happening on stage.<br />The sound has been remixed and re-mastered to perfection, all instruments come through clearly, capturing each musician's distinct sound. Tommy Adridge's drum attack is up front in the mix with all toms and cymbals audible, Rudy Sarzo's bass is clean and ever-present while the guitars are perfectly defined bringing every minor improvisation to front, you will actually be able to tell the difference between Vandenberg's and Vai's sound from the CD alone.<br /><br />The video, as mentioned above, was professionally shot but not for the purpose of a video-release, simply for direct transmission. This<br />practically implies that you get many cameras covering the event but not all angles are perfect, in addition the definition is found to be slightly lacking and finally the colours are rather imbalanced. At the end of the day, however, the content more than makes up for the lack of HD: you get all the rock-star poses from the band, all stage theatrics have been captured and most importantly all members have a respectable video presence on each and every song, so you get to see all five snakes playing and moving around the large stage.<br /><br />EXTRA FEATURES<br /><br />The DVD provides the option for 2.0 stereo and 5.1 surround sound which is quite a feat for an early recording as this; both options are impeccable. In terms of bonus material there is a gallery with stills from the same era but most importantly an extensive behind the scenes video. This video goes through the recording process of the multi platinum \\"Slip of the tongue\\" album finding the band in the studio near lake Tahoe testing ideas and having fun, the entry of Steve Vai in the line up, the process of filming the promo videos for the album as well as live footage, all topped by commentary by David Cloverdale who is the ideal narrator for such a journey.<br /><br />OVERALL<br /><br />\\"Live at Donnington 1990\\" is a breathtaking documentation of the \\"Whitesnake\\" golden era and captures nothing less than a band at the top of hard rock/hair metal world. Whatever limitations of the footage do not make this package any less enjoyable and certainly take nothing away from the amazing performances that were delivered that night. Needless to say, this is a must for anyone in 80s rock.content more than makes up for the lack of HD: you get all the rock-star poses from the band, all stage theatrics have been captured and most importantly all members have a respectable video presence on each and every song, so you get to see all five snakes playing and moving around the large stage.

B001MEJY8W|5.0|There is no real need to express this film on here as a lot of people have already done a great job. I can say this, I do enjoy horror films, even bad ones, when I went into this film that is what I expected, what I got was something way more than I could imagine. I have always said no matter how good or bad something is there will always be someone in the world who likes it or hates it...I am not sure how this film could be hated unless the following things apply to you....A. It was too intense for you to view. If this is the case why are you renting a movie like this in the first place? B. You go on review boards to bash anything people like. This is probably mostly the case, as I have found no matter how good something is, someone will want to bash it. C. You have a different taste in genre, which leads me back to \\"A\\" in why would you rent this movie? In other words, if you have a taste for this genre, you do not mind the intensity, and you are not a troll just looking to upset people, then not sure how you could not like this movie.
B004WJRDN2|5.0|The second album in Sir Paul's long reissue series is McCartney's self titled album from 1970 'McCartney'.  This deluxe set includes a the original album remastered, 7 bonus tracks on disc 2, and a 30min. DVD containg rare footage of Paul and Linda on the farm 'Mabye I'm A Amazed' music videos and 4 concert videos.    Package:  You can tell when you first open the 128 pg. hardcover book that it was made and designed with care.  The quality of the pages is fantastic and has very good print quality.  The back page houses the discs in a cardboard sleeve for each disc.    The Book:  The book is fantastic, filled with many seen and unseen photos.  Some great pictures of Paul recording the album, the original gatefold, pictures from the same time as the pics seen in the gatefold, and the press release interview paper is copied onto the pages.  The book is worth the $50 plus dollars alone.    Remastered Sound:  Well the album is great and one of Paul's best and this remaster makes it much more enjoyable.  The whole album is much brighter and cleaner sounding than previous releases,  plus with this deluxe set you get a card to redeem the album in an 'Unlimited' format which is even better than the CDs and definatley worth a listen.    Bonus Tracks:  Well from just looking at the listings for disc 2 you can tell it's skimpy and short on bonuses.  The unreleased 'Suicide' is the same line we already know repeated a few times in different tempos but still nice to have.  The next track is Maybe I'm A Amazed form One Hand Clapping which is different enough from the studio release to be enjoyable.  But the other 3 live tracks aren't that interesting and would be better suited released as full live albums.  'Don't Cry Baby' is an Oo You instrumental with Paul talking to baby Mary in the beginning.  'Women Kind' is supposedly from the McCartney sessions and is a rather silly song but one of the only interesting tracks on disc 2.    DVD:  The Album Story is Paul talking about the album (all pretty much from the book) and with some nice features.  The Beach is film footage with baby Mary in Paul's jacket played to an orchestra version of 'Junk'. The live tracks that are included are nice and will hopefully be released as a whole later.    This a great set for McCartney fans who will enjoy the attention to detail.  This set is well worth the $50 bucks you pay for this.  All I have to say now is, go get it now!  And I hope Paul and his team will remaster all his albums and give it a nice treatment like this.

B004EPYZZ8|5.0|Saw it in the theater twice, and have now pre-ordered it.  This is the only movie I have purchased this year.  I know my wife and kids will watch it multiple times.  It only pains me to see that it was released through Sony (Sony bore much of the responsibility for the root-kit viruses a few years back).  Were it released through any other production company, the purchase would have been pain free.

B002N5N5M0|5.0|I would say Dexter is the best show that I have watched lately.  The creators of this show made something so different from anything else you could watch that it is intriguing.  Also they do not write this like most other tv shows where the main character does the same thing every show with little differences, they really seem to work hard to make each season different not just each opponent different.
B004SBQAL0|4.0|The intro or trailer tells the whole story. Good aliens fight bad aliens on Earth. The aliens good or bad get intertwined with earthlings.  Evidently they did not hear Carl Sagan's warning that making love with an alien is like making love with a petunia.<br /><br />There is a little valence and car chasing but no profanity, nudity, or blood. There is no number two.<br /><br />I wonder if the same people will be in the TV series should this take place. I guess this presentation was tied to the book series do they could not really wrap it up in the end.<br /><br />The DVD extras include deleted scenes.  Becoming number six. After years Blu-ray and 60\\" TV's there is no need to tout the visuals and audio.<br /><br />Actual quote \\"I think the chance of a man mating with a petunia is much greater than the chance of him being able to mate, much less produce offspring, with an inhabitant of another planet.\\"

B004VUP8WK|5.0|The treatment Morbid Angel is getting for \\"Illud Divinum Insanus\\" is ridiculously unfair and shows just how intolerant audiences can be any more.  We should all know that a musician as good as Trey Azagthoth isn't going to keep writing the same album over and over.  No doubt he knew well the risk this new CD would be.<br />  Yes, there are a couple of industrial moments but this is not an industrial album and doesn't remind me one damn bit of industrial, not that having those traits is necessarily a bad thing.<br />  But here's why the critics, who are being very short sighted and thus influencing opinions before kids even buy the album, are slamming Morbid Angel:  it doesn't sound exactly like all the others.  We have more conventional drumming, catchier rhythms, and a cleaner sound than any previous album.  There are actual grooves on \\"Illud . . \\" and some people don't know how to deal with it.<br />  Let's face it:  \\"Heretic\\" suffered from a very muddy sound and some parts were unfocused.  Steve Tucker was okay, but he lacked the personality and charisma of David Vincent.  But it sounded like the other stuff so it passed.  \\"Domination\\" is the closest thing to \\"Illud\\", and my guess is had this new one been released next after \\"Domination\\", people would have thought it was a logical step forward.<br />  \\"Illud\\" is heavy - it's real heavy.  It has the trademark orchestral moments, some twisted stuff like \\"Nevermore\\" that harkens back to the more classic sound, and in cuts like \\"Destructors Vs. The Earth\\" and \\"Radikult\\" we get spacious drums and a real beat, not just the tired old blast beats that are becoming so cliched and annoying.  Azagthoth's guitar work as usual is stellar and miles ahead of the competition.<br />  This is not \\"Cold Lake\\" or some other famous misstep.  Morbid Angel are breaking new ground, and you can come along and dig it or not, but this CD will not be regarded as the failure so many reviewers want you to think it is with due time.  Don't let others make up your mind for you.  I think \\"Illud Divinum Insanus\\" is a damn fine album and I'm glad to finally have some new Morbid Angel.is with due time.    Don't let others make up your mind for you.    I think \\"Illud Divinum Insanus\\" is a damn fine album and I'm glad to finally have some new Morbid Angel.

B004LWZWEC|1.0|After reading the reviews of the poor picture quality, I am wondering, is it worth getting the 2-disc outrageously priced set? What is on the second disc? I still have my VHS but heard they sunk up the stereo audio from the \\"Bonfire\\" Box and when it switches to spoken word in interviews, the audio is drastically reduced? Help out another Bon fan! Thanks
0767811070|5.0|I love this movie.  It always makes me cry toward the end.  Powerful and moving; riviting and raw are a few words to describe this great film.  I'm not a writer or a film critic but I say just go ahead and buy it, you won't be dissappointed.
B004O86JZ4|5.0|First, create the best album to date (oh, and record it in your garage on analog tape!) Release it to the masses so fans like me are blown away by it's incredible songwriting and engineering!<br />Second, Hire Jame Moll to document and make a band history from the days of Nirvana to the recording of \\"Wasting Light\\". That sounds like a plan!<br />  To sum up this album as whole, that's a simple \\"It Rocks\\" review. To review each track is what people tend to rather see...and I will be brutally honest because there may be one track they could have rejected in the line-up.<br /><br />BRIDGE BURNING - A perfect album opener! It truly shows the machine that is \\"Foo Fighters\\"! This is a very intricate song along the lines of \\"RUSH\\" time signatures with a great hook Chances are good it may become a hit!<br /><br />Rope- Already a smash through the world! This was one of the songs I heard first. Again a great hook surrounded by great verses that chug along at speed of sound.<br /><br />Dear Rosemary - A very dark yet uplifting at the same time (is that possible)! Great harmonies from Bob Mould (ala Huska DU) Making this track stand on it's own as maybe not a hit but for fans wanting a different feel of Foo, this one will enchant you!<br /><br />White Limo - This is the track they could have by passed! Dave screams throughout the song and takes away from the flow of the album.<br /><br />Arlandria - Back on track with this great album track! Great writing and perfection. Don't forget folks, this is not a \\"Pro-tool\\" album. This album was done the old fashion and preferred way. Only the best can record analog!<br /><br />These Days - WOW! Probably my favorite off \\"Wasting Light\\". Dave's lyrics are both haunting and truthful. Far be it from Dave through-out Foo Fighters 16 year history to put a song in the mix that touches your soul! This better be a hit!<br /><br />Back & Forth - Great guitar driven chugging rhythm! A great track but don't see it as a hit...just a great album track that belongs perfectly at home on this album.<br /><br />A Matter Of Time - Another guitar chugger with great drumming by Taylor & great bass work by Nate. This is proof of the great rhythm section in the Foo's!<br /><br />Miss This Misery - Great heavy slow metal rocker with fantastic harmoies by Fee Waybill of The Tubes fame.<br /><br />I Should Have Know - A song we can all relate with in many poor decisions made through life. Probably my send favorite. Adding Krist Novoselic from Nirvana on an over powered bass line and also on accordion. Jessy Green who was in the Wembley show, adds her violin to add the whole haunting music and lyrics like \\"and I should not forgive you yet..\\" All the makings of a number one again with this track.<br /><br />Walk - By the time of this review, this is their latest hit and video. The song was also included in the \\"Thor\\" soundtrack. Obviously, with their choice of making this the 2nd single, it was well worth the decision! \\"Learning to walk again...I believe I waited long enough..\\" another instant classic. If you are or never even saw the movie \\"Falling Down\\" starring Michael Douglas...you have to drop by ([...]) to see this funny and so Foo Fighter-like video! You will be hooked into the song immediately<br /><br />For those who bought or plan to by the version with the bonus CD. It contains  a Deadmau5 mix of \\"Rope\\". Not that impressed, but has another bonus track \\"Better Off\\" which was one of the many songs passed on for the album. My opinion, it would have worked better in mix instead of \\"White Limo\\". To me ..this album starts a new chapter in Foo Fighter history since the prios Cd was their \\"Greatest Hits\\" which is sparse and left off many favorites but included the incredible \\"Wheels\\" and \\"Word Forword\\". Hoping The guys do a show in the North East! This is definitely my favorite album of the year! It seems unlikely someone can trump this masterpiece!ack that belongs perfectly at home on this album.<br /><br />A Matter Of Time - Another guitar chugger with great drumming by Taylor & great bass work by Nate.

6304806418|5.0|Neither the movie, Madonna, nor Bandares received Oscar recognition -- what a shame.  The plot, scenery, Lloyd-Webber's music and Jonathan Pryce's support all came together to make a classic.  This movie will be around as a Classic/Cult Classic for years while the movie and actors that won the Oscar that year can bask in the glory of anonymity.  Not their fault, of course, but shame on you -- Academy.

After reading the reviews on this  Buggy Buddy, I decided to buy it.<br /><br />It is great! It fit my city mini and does not get in the way when I want to recline the seat.<br /><br />The only thing I noticed was that it had a really strong smell (smell like petroleum) when it was in the package. But once I attached it to the stroller and started walking outside, I couldn't smell it any more.

1439102724|3.0|Like so many other reviewers, I'm a big fan of Jodi Picoult's books.  But not this one.  I still think she's a good writer and I enjoy the way she unfolds the story, but there were many things about Sing You Home that left me less than enthusiastic.  It's got too many researched topics floating around for one thing, and Jodi is so intent on getting the details of her research in that the story suffers.  At times, I skimmed whole sections.  I couldn't relate to any of the characters either (and in a good novel with well developed characters I can relate to even horrible characters).  The story is preachy, and the \\"good guys\\" and \\"bad guys\\" aren't nuanced, more like caricatures than real people.  I was still thinking I'd give the book four stars until I reached the end.  It was a cheap, easy out, unbelievable and, (hope this isn't a spoiler)how the heck to people in a school system know nothing about a troubled student's family?  I was so angry at that one I wanted to throw the book.
B004VUP8WK|1.0|I'm afer this band from the early days of the tape trading underground (their genre defining first demo tape). Well, this album is a total waste. A useless mix of techno-industrial and pseudo-death metal. Utter crap!
B003FGRPWC|5.0|If you like movies such as Magnolia, American Beauty, and Little Miss Sunshine, you will love this series. I could watch these shows (and have) many times over and never get bored with them. As this show deals with the private lives of several generations of characters, there is bound to be someone's story you can relate to within the show. Depressing? Only if you think life itself is depressing.
B003UESJH4|5.0|The story is based on real events and real people. The acting is superb, the script perfect and the casting a touch of genius.<br />Some have critized this film for being slow, or a boring subject.<br />Well, we all knew what it was about before we even saw it, the previews said it all, so we knew what to expect.<br />If you don't get it, then no amount of good reviews, award nominations or anything anyone says will change your mind.<br />The amount of effort that went into this movie, to get it all so perfect, shows dedication and passion to the art of film making. It's a shame that so few films of this calibre are made these days.
B002VECM6S|5.0|A great movie of hope, love and dedication. Dedication not only from the player, but also the family that brought him in. They help not only with his sport but also his education, even if it was to get him to college it has a great message of the importance academics should have with the athlete. Great true story!

Mickey Haller is also a favorite character, and Michael makes the courtroom drama come to life.  It is interesting to see all of the research and digging that goes into a courtroom defense.

This group has been one of the sensations in the area of pop music.From the lyrics to the rich vocals of Morten the group always touched the chord of your inner self.Being a die hard fan of A-ha it is sad that we won't hear the group any more, but for those who only savoured rock music, it is time you guys purchase this item and soak in the music.

B004ZGI2KK|2.0|I wont' go detailing what I didn't like it. I do like Gary Oldman so far, and some others actors, but acting was really ... what to say, even bad doesn't give justice, because I think is not their fault really, I think they were miscast first, second the story have a very lame dialogue at times. I wanted to be a little bit darker.. I don't know, kind of Sleepy Hollow, but many of the actors are already known for not being really good, and others were to shallow. I didn't enjoyed.
B002OT7314|4.0|\\"Flashpoint\\" is subtitled \\"Recorded Live 1989-90 Steel Wheels / Urban Jungle World Tour\\" and was originally released in 1991. Most true Stones fans will love this CD. It holds up favorably to other live recordings (\\"Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out\\", \\"Love You Live\\", \\"Still Life\\", \\"Live Licks\\", and \\"Stripped\\"). In fact, \\"Flashpoint\\" has some of the edginess of \\"Live Licks\\" and some of the laid back charm of \\"Stripped\\". Jagger, Richards, Wood, Wyman and Watts are backed up by the fabulous Bobby Keys on sax, plus other horns and 2 on keyboards. Some unknown dude named Eric Clapton ;-) plays guitar on \\"Little Red Rooster\\" (the only non-Jagger/Richards composition on the set). Collectors may want to consider the 2-CD deluxe version [[ASIN:B00000DSG6 Flashpoint]] which includes \\"Everything Is Turning To Gold\\", \\"Fancy Man Blues\\", \\"Beat of Burden\\", and \\"Cook Cook Blues\\" (not to be confused with the rare and raw C.S.

Much of this material also appears on the recent mega-set [[ASIN:B004N44SPM The Complete Singles (1971-2006) [45 CDs]]] although in different configurations; several of the deluxe extras appear on [[ASIN:B000BP86MI Rarities 1971-2003]].
B0036XN2L2|4.0|After an extremely long, influential, and storied career complete that spanned eighteen (!) studio efforts, four live releases,  twenty-three compilations/\\"best-of's,\\" several (i.e. at least five) side-projects, a truckload of famous hit singles, a ton of touring, and eighty million records sold worldwide, hard rock/heavy metal/glam primitives Scorpions have decided to call it a career. But fear not, fans, because this dissolution came not before dropping another new full-length. \\"Sting Of The Tail,\\" was released in 2010, marking their forty-fifth anniversary of being a band. Groups that are anywhere near as old as this are exceedingly rare to come by, anymore; and many of those that are still around seem to have lost their touch long ago. But The Scorpions put to rest any remaining doubt that you might have had once and f or all. On \\"Sting,\\" they once again offer more than enough proof that they are still extremely energized, inspired, potent, and well-oiled. And they might verge on sounding a little bit dated at times, here, but overall, they can still rock mighty hard. In fact, one could make the argument that they can still rock the house with the most of the best of `em. `<br /><br />These eleven new songs can be broken down into four parts. Numbers one, \\"Raised On Rock,\\" two (which is vintage glam), the pure speed metal of number six, \\"Rock Zone,\\" and eight, \\"Turn You On,\\" are all surprisingly aggressive and up-tempo. They are bolstered by fiery, chug and churn riffing, strong hooks, memorable choruses, power metal harmonies, occasional ripping guitar solos, and prominent, muscular, underlying bass lines. Also make sure you pay special attention to the last of these tunes, because it \\"rocks like heaven and hell\\"; and features a climactic and epic section with the record's best soloing. Next, there are big riff rockers like \\"Slave Me,\\" (which is very reminiscent of Dokken and Dio, and sports fist-pumping vocals and careening shred solos), \\"No Limit,\\" and \\"Spirit Of Rock.\\" Finally, there is a fair amount of material that is very lush, Eighties-esque power balladry. \\"The Good Die Young\\" is but one example, and it is long on soaring melodies, clean, pensive singing, docile harmonies, crunchy  choruses, and screaming guitar solos. \\"Lorelei,\\" with its warm and pretty acoustic strums, the very Iron Maiden/Queensryche-inspired \\"Sly,\\", and the bloated, and vocal hook-saturated closer, the ironically-entitled \\"The Best Is Yet To Come\\", follow-suit later on.<br /><br />It might not be the best Scorpions album of all time, but it is regardless a pretty darn good and rock solid one. It might not break down any walls, but it is most important for it to be an enjoyable listen. And that it is - very enjoyable. (All fans should be pleased with the \\"sting\\" left by the band this time around.) And one other thing is for certain: If this is the last we will ever hear from the Scorpions, then at least they went out sounding as poisonous as ever.k.\\" Finally, there is a fair amount of material that is very lush, Eighties-esque power balladry. \\"The Good Die Young\\" is but one example, and it is long on soaring melodies, clean, pensive singing, docile harmonies, crunchy  choruses, and screaming guitar solos. \\"Lorelei,\\" with its warm and pretty acoustic strums, the very Iron Maiden/Queensryche-inspired \\"Sly,\\", and the bloated, and vocal hook-saturated closer, the ironically-entitled \\"The Best Is Yet To Come\\", follow-suit later on.

B0052UZIFA|2.0|Would be a great game if it weren't for the incessant &quot;Loading&quot; message that appears every 10-15 seconds during gameplay. Then I have to unpause and continue. Terribly aggravating on my SGS with Froyo. Almost unplayable as-is. Possibly a conflict with notifications? Whatever the case, it's not worth the irritation. Fix it!
B0034G4ORC|4.0|At it's heart, Battle: Los Angeles is yet another retelling of H. G. Wells' seminal story, War of the Worlds. Like that classic invasion story, this one begins with a meteor shower that takes a turn for the worse when it becomes apparent that those meteors are actually extraterrestrial vessels containing a deadly cargo of alien soldiers hellbent on conquering our world for our natural resources, especially our water.    What unfolds is a world war where the unprepared forces of Earth must confront an unexpected threat from beyond. Thrust into this maelstrom is a Marine unit, largely lead by Sgt. Michael Nantz, tasked with rescuing some civilians who are trapped in a police station that is now behind enemy lines. As you can probably figure out on your own, when you send a Marine unit on a collision course with alien invaders, well, your gonna get a lot of fireworks.    So, that's the summation. Does this movie work?    I don't know what movie the critics were watching, but it wasn't the awesomely entertaining Battle: Los Angeles I watched last night!    Now, don't get me wrong - this isn't a perfect movie, nor a completely original one - but nonetheless I found BLA (I'm tired of writing out the name ) to be a throwback to classic sci-fi film making of the 1950's - you know the type: those classic alien invasion tales heavily influenced by the Red Scare; the \\"aliens are evil and need to be gun-downed by red blooded Americans\\" type of tale that they haven't made in a long while. On this, BLA succeeds wonderfully as we get to watch US Marines, along with the USAF and Army, attempt to battle back and stop the alien invasion over the course of approximately 48 hours. The aliens are clearly evil - we get to watch a bunch of television news clips where they can be seen gunning down civies - so this is definitely not one of your pansy, politically correct Avatar-like flicks where the humans are the bad guys - and I am tremendously grateful for that moral clarity. These aliens are bad and we are good. Now it's time to kill 'em.    But in addition to this being a tribute of 50s-era sci-fi, this movie is also a tribute to classic war flicks. As you watch BLA, you will find yourself thinking less in terms of Independence Day and more along the lines of Battleground, Black Hawk Down, or The Hurt Locker. In other words, this movie is, first and foremost, a military sci fi flick, the likes of which we haven't seen since James Cameron's classic Aliens. This is a movie about war and the men who have to fight it battle by battle, and not about soldiers that have time for existential ponderings or deep discussions about the \\"nature of war.\\" Nor is it about giant robots or befuddled Jedi warriors. Thank the maker!    Helping the movie is the fact that it looks and sounds great. The FX are impressive, so much so that I was surprised this wasn't one of those 80 or 90 minute smash and grabs, but rather a movie that just ran short of two hours. The visuals do an excellent job of bringing the war to life with vim and vigor, in the process creating some very memorable scenes. I particularly enjoyed the realization of the aliens, not that they were particularly original - there is a lot of District 9 to them - but the fact that they were the analogues of the US Marines. That is, unlike other movies that seem to get carried away by flights of fantasy when it comes to imagining an alien invasion, this movie stuck to it's mil sci-fi roots and imagined the aliens to largely function like their earth military counter-parts. So we get to see alien foot-soldiers, alien officers (taller than the rest), alien drones, alien aircraft, even an incredibly cool and realistically clumsy alien crew-served heavy weapon!    Likewise, the sound FX are well done, bringing the battle to vivid life with all the appropriate sounds of war, as well as some alien noises (I particularly enjoyed the 'pop-pop' of the alien reaction thrusters ). If you have a surround sound system, crank of the volume!    Lastly, I found the cinematography to be handled well - this is where I vehemently disagree with the critics who were wont to call it \\"nauseating\\". While I don't usually care for the shaky camera documentary style, especially when we are merely watching two men having a sedate conversation (as this movie does ), once the action starts, it does an excellent job of bring the battles to frenetic life. Between the audio and visual FX, and the camera work, the battles in BLA will have you on the edge of your seat.    So, what's not to like?    First and foremost, the length of the movie. It runs for 116 minutes, which is too short! I wanted to see so much more! I mean, this is a world-wide invasion! I can imagine all sort of interesting battles, missions, guerrilla actions, and alien autopsies (there is an impromptu one in here, though ). Two hours is just too short! Fortunately, the powers that be have let it be known that this is the first of a series of films. I hope we can look forward to Battle: NY, Battle: Paris, Battle: Tokyo (all mentioned in the film). I also wish them luck with any and all game tie-ins. Maybe we'll even get some books and a TV show?    But there is a more serious problem with the running length being too short. This movie tries to cram much too much into its running time, resulting in a movie that proceeds at a breathless pace. It runs so fast that as soon as the movie begins you feel as if you came in late and need to catch up on what you missed. This is a shame for two reasons:    First, the breathless pace hurts character development. BLA is not Aliens in that there are no memorable characters outside of Sgt. Nantz. This is because the movie spends a bare 10 minutes or so introducing them to us, reducing them to \\"the guy getting married\\", \\"the friend of the guy getting married\\", \\"the raw recruit\\", etc. Even Sgt. Nanzt, well played by Aaron Echhart, lacks serious development, which is a shame because he seems to have aninteresting past involving a costly action in Afghanistan where he lost some of his men, an issue that will dog him throughout this film. The mere fact that after watching the whole film I am still hazy about just what exactly happened to Nantz is indicative of the lack of serious character development. The same goes for Corpsman (or, if you're President Obama, 'corpseman') Jibril Adukwu, a soldier of African decent who made for an interesting and likeable character. The movie needed some more time to develop these guys, but rather chose to rush off to war.    Secondly, I lament the films pace because it eliminates the opportunity to crank up the tension of the impending invasion. As with H. G. Wells classic story, as well as the two movie versions of his book, the best part of an alien invasion is knowing that it is coming and being unable to warn the characters in the film. Unfortunately, instead of the drip-drip-drip of slowly building tension and apprehension, BLA pretty much just does the equivalent of \\"a weird meteor storm is coming....this means WAR!!!!\\" >Sigh< So much wasted tension potential.    Another complaint is that is does borrow somewhat obviously from other films, particularly Aliens and District 9. For example, Michelle Rodriguez pretty much reprises the role of Pvt. Vasquez. What is more, there is a scene where the Marines take a LAV and start running over the aliens, including shooting one in the face during the process...sound familiar? And there is a District 9-esque buried spacecraft as well. Add in a demolished US airbase as in ID4, and you can pretty much conclude that when BLA borrows material, it does so unabashedly. Fortunately, most of this borrowing is in the last half hour, so it doesn't get too annoying. I guess they just started to run out of original material.    Lastly, the ending battle is a bit too contrived and rushed. I would expect an alien command center to be a tough nut to crack, but not here. It is painfully obvious thatthe film needed a feel good moment to end the story but was running out of time (or money), so they threw this together. The battle does have some good action to it, but it is ultimately yet another take on needing to shoot a photon torpedo into an exhaust shaft that is only three meters wide. Oh well. If Independence Day can be praised for its \\"sci-fi tributes\\", so can this film.    Now we come to the important question:    Why did the critics so hate this film?    I can only offer two possibilities, with the truth no doubt being somewhere in the middle:    First, this is a very patriotic movie. Here, the military men and women are portrayed as larger than life heroes, risking all to save their country. In fact, they are so heroic that, like Space Marines, they begin inspiring civilians to bravery in the face of the enemy. I have no doubt this ticked off more than a few of the more, er, cosmopolitan critics.    The second reason I think the critics disliked this movie is because of it's authentic mil sci-fi trappings. This is a film that has NOTHING in common with the juvenile sci-fi nonsense we've been force fed for years now. There aren't any teens running around with an \\"all spark\\" to save the world where the adults have failed (indeed, here we have the opposite where the older Sgt. Nantz keeps the kids in the fight and not vice versa), nor are they any lighthearted comedic moments to remind us that alien invasions can be fun, too. This is a largely grim movie (but could be grimmer - darn you PG-13!) about war. Quite frankly, I think most critics, lulled to sleep by years of fluffy Transformer and Star Wars/Star Trek flicks, just didn't understand what was going on. After all, the last real mil sci-fi we had was Cameron's Aliens...some fifteen years ago! That says a lot right there. I truly believe this film just confused the lot of them with its lack of after school content.    So there you have it, my review of Battle: Los Angeles. I liked this movie...reallyliked it. I liked it so much, that I encourage you to spend money on it via DVDs, BluRays, and VoD. The cast and crew of this movie deserve to be rewarded for making such an enjoyable film. But more than that, serious sci-fi fans need to step up and declare that if a studio has the courage to return to mature, old school sci-fi, they will be rewarded with cold, hard cash. By no means a perfect film, Battle: Los Angeles is nonetheless one worth supporting not so much for what it is, as for what it isn't.

B004EPYZPS|5.0|The Review:<br /><br />When Steven Spielberg and J. J. Abrams get together to make a movie, rest assured it's going to be good.  The only question is just how good. Super 8 is a mash-up of E.T. and Cloverfield.  That's an oversimplification and a big disservice to the hard work that went into Super 8, which stands on its own two feet as a sci-fi movie with a lot of heart.  Much of that heart comes from Super 8's child actors who far outshine most of their adult counterparts this movie season.  Joel Courtney and Elle Fanning stand out in the two lead roles, but everyone in the movie did an A+ job, at times capturing the camaraderie of films like Stand by Me as well as the sense of wild eyed adventure from Goonies.<br /><br />Super 8 tells the story of a group of friends in an Ohio steel town who witness a cataclysmic train crash, inadvertently capturing it on a super 8 movie camera while making a student film. It's clear that something monstrous was aboard that train and made its escape during the crash. When the U.S. Air force comes to town, local law man, Jackson Lamb does his best to get to the bottom of a series of disappearances and thefts that plague the town in the wake of the crash.  But the civilians who know the most about what happened the night of the crash are the kids who witnessed it while shooting their super 8 movie, including Jackson's son, Joe.<br /><br />Super 8 does an excellent job of taking you along the adventure with its characters.  You'll uncover the mystery alongside them. Unlike a who done it, I never felt the need to guess who or what was behind all the craziness. Super 8 just took me along for a crazy ride, and I enjoyed every minute of it, and as with the best thrill rides I totally lost track of the time.  Going into the movie I feared there would be a boring half hour build up or some down time, as there is in a lot of 2 hour movies. I'm looking at you A.I. I couldn't have been more wrong. Super 8 is pitch perfect. Action, laughs, human drama and a few scares. It's all there.  I won't spoil the set piece action scenes in this review, but there is one in particular which is the best I've seen so far this year, and that includes action tour de forces like Source Code, Thor, and X-Men: First Class.<br /><br />Special mention must be made at how the film makers captured 1979 down to the tiniest detail. Super 8 doubles as a time warp the same way Mad Men does with Don Draper and company. To sum it up, Super 8 is a must see and it's very much a big screen movie experience, even at today's inflated ticket prices.<br /><br />FTC Advisory: We purchased our own tickets.es.

B004132HZS|5.0|Forget the deerstalker hat and pipe, this isn't your grandma's Sherlock. But that being said, it's a modern twist that is amazingly still true to the character and charisma of the original stories. You won't be disappointed. The only downside, there are only three episodes. Can't wait for next season.
0316069353|1.0|I want to like Michael Connelly.  Actually I want to love him just like everybody else!   And yet upon close inspection, other than  one good premise line, he really doesn't deliver.  His writing is plodding, charm and charisma free, and he manages to leach out any color LA has.  The things that work for him are the bits and pieces his journalistic self has picked up from others,  the Lincoln lawyer really exists -- the cases belong to others and he reports them.  His famous court scenes are incorrect, legal mistakes and errors are made that are not character flaw based but law buddy advice mistakes and actually unravel his entire story   He seems to be the commercial heir apparent in this genre because... He is prolific -  he's pushing books out a pace that makes it seem like he just found out he has only months to live. He's competent but nothing more.  So I guess it's not that the emperor is entirely  naked, in Connelly's case the emperor is just wearing a terrible shorts outfit with dark socks but has a really good publicist.

0156347113|5.0|The \\"General Theory\\" is two things.  It's brilliant and it's complicated.  While it lays the foundation for modern economics, it's by no means a book that someone should read before they've been fairly well-versed in the subject.  While it is undoubtedly groundbreaking, that very fact makes it a book that shouldn't be read as an introduction.  The GT was for economics what relativity was for physics-- because of that, Keynes spends much of GT grappling with the orthodoxy that he later undermines.  This leads the work to be equivocating and uncertain.  Two of the major developments that come out of it are the refutation of Say's Law in Part 1.  It's impossible to overstate the importance of that development for modern macroeconomics.  It's the economics equivalent of the theory of gravity because it establishes what is essentially the modern view of recessions-- the possibility that there can be a shortfall of demand.  The second development is Keynes's formulation on financial markets, which refutes the classical assumption that financial markets are rational and perfect (in the technical sense).      The second thing to take from this review is that literally not a single one of the one or two-star reviews (aside from the ones criticizing this particular publication or the Kindle price or whatever) actually read or understood the GT.  The GT is NOT about running massive fiscal deficits or government control of the means of production.  The implication that deficits financed by government works projects in a liquidity trap (when excess demand for cash makes monetary policy ineffective) does naturally follow from GT, but there's nothing about deficits being forever and always desirable (indeed, Keynes would be horrified at that proposition).    Having said this, a clearer and perhaps more intuitive and straightforward derivation of Keynes's relevant conclusions can be found in the work of Paul Samuelson (the most influential economist of the second half of the 20th century) from the 1950's, where he develops the neo-classical synthesis and the IS-LM model that clarifies the relationship between fiscal and monetary policy.  But once Samuelson has been mastered, the GT is the place to go to understand the economics underlying Samuelson's models.  Then one can really appreciate the significance of Keynes's insight.

The album is probably the last \\"great one\\" before all the mayhem hits.

The album does rock and if you are a kiss fan, this is a must along with alive and destroyer. Just buy it ...
1936719010|2.0|I stopped reading after 20 minutes or so, and I had almost finished the book. I found it to be pretty lightweight and full of cliches. The different fonts, varying type sizes, and constant shifting of text alignment were highly annoying (some pages have only ONE word on them). If the content was presented in a typical manuscript format, it would be only a couple of pages long.
B0034G4ORM|1.0|Proof positive some movies are a business model instead of an artistic creation. Not one single iota of talent or finesse went into the making of this film. This is essentially the poor man's Black Hawk Down meets Independence Day, while borrowing cliche plot points from just about every major war movie ever made. All things that could be overlooked if it weren't for the awful script; not even Ridley Scott could have saved this film.<br /><br />I could write a lengthy review pointing out how awful this movie is on every level, but it's not even worth me wasting my time. I'll settle for this:<br /><br />Dialogue is 95% consisting of marines grunting or yelling \\"Staff Sergeant!!!!\\"<br />Dialogue is cheesier than dangerously cheesy Cheetos. \\"I'd go to hell and back for you.\\" .....really? Lets not even get into the pep-talk scene near the end. Some of the worst writing I've ever seen.<br />The aliens are laughable, at best. Seeing them evokes no sense of fear or dread, they look like rejects from a Star Wars droid casting call.<br />I could care less about any of the characters, they're all hollow and rarely speak more than a sentence at a time.<br />Plot has poor pacing, makes no sense, is uninteresting and totally disjointed. This is more video game than movie, minus, you know, you actually playing it.<br />Cliche's at every level of the film. I couldn't find one original idea or plot point. It's as if the director said, \\"omg hay guyz, lets make a terrible mash up of every successful war movie and add aliens because that would appeal to teenage boys who play Halo!\\"<br /><br />Given how interesting this film could have been and how insultingly bad it was, I find it mind boggling that there are actually positive reviews here. The only person I could see liking this movie, in any capacity, is the type of person you ask what they think is the greatest film of all time, and they respond: \\"Armageddon!\\"
0061726826|4.0|I had no idea that this was part of a series until after I read it. So initially I hated this book because of the ending.<br />However, knowing that the story may/will continue, I'm crossing my fingers that the events that occured at the end of Delirium will be made right.<br />I liked the idea that the government \\"cures\\" love by performing some sort of lobotomy making all the adults placid zombie-like people. They believe love is an illness because it makes people do crazy things and believe that their cure will ensure peace... Ha!<br /><br />Anyway,it's entertaining, frustrating, a good balance between romance (nothing graphic), action and angst, and worth reading for sure. I'm ready for book 2!!

Very likable, informative and very usable as a learning tool that compels its reader to continue to absorb page after page, chapter after chapter! In short, once started, it's hard to put this book down.<br /><br />For anyone wishing to market a product or service or develop their brand in the 21st century social media will have a huge impact. Which makes this a must-have book. Author, Dave Kerpen shares a great deal of knowledge and expertise with his readers on how marketing today - whether intending to use social media or not - is being changed by how customers and clients are driving producers and providers to pay attention to and communicate directly.<br /><br />According to Kerpen, selling on social media is done by listening and responding to individual needs or concerns - which makes sense with any good relationship, or one deserving to be nurtured. And, from my own experience - as one who invested twenty years selling in the business and technology sector - communication beyond \\"selling\\" is the now way to successfully conduct business.<br /><br />Likable social media lives up to its name and delivers on its promise. You can count on greatly increasing you're marketing presence and effectiveness in the 21st century with this book.<br /><br />Allan Hay,<br />Career Development Consultant, Instructor and Author<br />Memory Mining, Digging for Gems from Your Past Good Work

B0034G4ORC|1.0|After reading enough good reviews and having a liking for any kind of war flick, I decided to buy the film at my local Walmart. Since I watched the film in my living room, I could not walk out. Battle: Los Angeles is not a film as much as a video game, with video sequences that repeat in intent if not literally so, and audio and dialogue that DOES repeat. Often. Couple that with a lame minimalistic storyline and incredibly bad acting, and you have one of the worst films in a long time. If you are a fan of the original SF war film Starship Troopers, as I am, you will be sorely disappointed in this work which borrows extensively from better films such as Independence Day, War of the Worlds, District 9, and even Skyline. Not that it doesn't have some interest for film students. If you are fan of Avid film editing you will enjoy taking the sequences apart to see how modern editing can make something out of nothing. But for the rest of us, there are much better choices.
B000P0J02E|5.0|I'm a big POTC trilogy fan and a big fan of Hans Zimmer. I also give credit to Klaus Badelt, who did the original score for Black Pearl. Zimmer took Badelt's music and followed with his own interpretation of what the score should be. This third installment is clearly the winner of the three soundtracks. The tracks are longer and the music is more epic; listening to the finale can be likened to a huge wave of symphonic beauty washing over you, one that can be enjoyed over and over again. All three POTC soundtracks are great, but if you only choose one, this is it.
B003EYVXUU|3.0|If you have already seen the original Swedish film be prepared to be disappointed. 'Let Me In' is almost a shot-for-shot remake of 'Let the Right One In', the Swedish vampire film by director Tomas Alfredson. There are scripting changes that appears to have been done to tailor the script to American audiences. Some are understandable, others are not. For example, the original is set in a Swedish community that was built in the age of Swedish socialism and this setting is part of the film's backstory which is set in the cold winter of 1982. The American version changes this to an apartment complex during a cold snowy winter in ....  1980's Arizona(?). The impact of the setting laid out in the original is lost in the remake. In the original, Oscar's mother is obviously not religious; in the remake Owen's mother (name change here) is clearly very religious for no apparent reason.    The original film has a particularly Swedish approach to storytelling which is one of things that makes it such an interesting film for film fans who like to understand a director's style.    Much has been made about the use of CGI in this film. The remake has too obviously inserted CGI in 2 critical scenes. They are fake looking, obviously CGI,  and are out of place in a film that was produced to have a realistic film approach.   The remake IS a good film and a welcomed relief for what passes as a horror film nowadays, and normally would deserve a higher rating then 3 stars. But since I rate the original a 4-star film, and the remake is not quite the film that the original is, this version need a lesser rating.  The director also makes, in my opinion, a mistake in his commentary in not acknowledging that his film is a direct remake of the original. He takes credit for the look of film which is clearly not his; lighting, cinematography, and acting style is a copy of the work of Tomas Alfredson. Watch both and see for yourself.

B0050PYNOY|4.0|On a lark I saw this with a long time friend of mine.  We were laughing our heads off, laughing so hard we hurt.      Really funny, there were KIDS in the audience.  But the kids got the nasty jokes too!  Wonder if their parents told them later any \\"Wizard\\" offers them a special leaf in exchange for \\"Fun\\" to tell them so they can \\"negotiate\\" with the shotgun;-)      Frankly, this movie is what I WISH could have been made in the 80s.  It reminded me quite lovingly of good classic but FAMILY movies, Dark Crystal, Labyrinth, etc.  I'd like to see more along this line, like a sequel to Sword and the Sorceror, lots of good and NON-FAMILY NON-PC and well acted/good effects fantasy movies.  There's too much PC drek out there without the fun and wonder.

B000W7JWUA|5.0|This game is incredibly enjoy to play. The way it's set-up guarantees that every single game you play will be a unique experience.<br /><br />My favorite aspect of this game is the trading. It forces players to be tactful, just like in real-life, and not rely on things like experience points or brute force. The economy of Catan is not something to underestimate.<br /><br />Honestly, this game is 50% skill and then about 50% luck (due to the dice), but that doesn't change how much fun it is play.<br /><br />And in all seriousness, winning this game just feels good.
B001AKTZOQ|5.0|I can remember it like it was yesterday, me, my brother and my dad went to shoot some pool at a place right up the street from our house. While we were there hangin out shootin the bull and tilting a few back the begining of ccr\\"s I heard it through the grapevine came on over the speakers. At this point I was aware of ccr but had not heard everything they had done. All I can say is that my brother was looking at me and his lips were moving and Im sure he was talking to me but I could not tell you a damn thing he said. I was completly inraptured in the music I was hearing and by the time the guitar chorus kicked in I was coverd head to toe in goosebumps. Needless to say after I heard the entire album I was certain that ccr was one of the greatest things to happen to popular music.
1416909532|5.0|Charlene Davis,MSW Author of Pay Attention to the Red Flags. He is just not into you is a must read. I bought this book for several of my friends. It never cease to amaze me how women make so many excuses for men when it is totally clear that he is not in to them. Greg made it clear, if he is not calling, he is not into you. If he stands you up, he is not a man of his word. This book is so needed, and extremely educational. It explains the importance of women paying attention to a man's actions instead of what comes out his mouth. This book can even help men to be more truthful. It can develop those men that want to change into better human-beings. Women need this book all over the world. Greg, I give you so much credit for writing such a needed book. I would recommend this book to everyone.

B001GCUO5M|3.0|Like virtually every movie based on a novel, I'm glad I read the book first because I was then able to pay attention to nuances in the movie.  However, I'm not sure whether I would've like the movie more if I hadn't read it first.  The book was a fairly quick read but the movie's pace felt relatively slower.  I do appreciate how closely it followed the book, though.  It omitted a few scenes but didn't take liberties with the story.  DiCaprio did a fine acting job as usual, but he wasn't what I pictured for the Teddy character.  He has too much of a pretty boy look that doesn't reflect the stress endured by the character.
B004M3H17Q|5.0|James Blake's self titled album is a unique album coming out in a time where most 'popular' music is loud, busy, and full of clutter.  Most of it doesn't sound personal at all, and most of the time these artists aren't even writing the music they are singing/playing.  This is the main reason why I find this album by James Blake to be so refreshing and enjoyable.<br /><br />Every song utilizes Blakes soulful and fragile vocal palette backed by gentle and ambient undercurrents of electronic sounds and downtempo beats.  It comes across as a extremely intimate album due to the sparse minimalistic approach Blake has taken.  Most noticeably this is seen in 'Lindesfarne I', which I believe is the most important part of the album, where Blake sings though a vocoder to distort his voice into an autotuned version of its original form.  His voice is the only audible sound in this track, and after each verse is sung there is complete silence.  The lyrics sink in during these subtle breaks, and instead of sounding pretentious it sounds extremely touching and makes you look inside yourself in an introspective sense.  As all great music can effect you, this song, and most of the album touched me.  The final song 'Measurements' finishes the album on a somewhat optimistic and upbeat note, with Blake singing a final ballad backed with a soulful vocal harmony and backing bass.<br /><br />I first listened to this album while doing an early morning shift at my work (A supermarket) where I had to open up the store and get everything ready for opening in a few hours.  I was downstairs in the pitch black storage area when 'Unluck' came on, and it was such a apt moment in time for me to be listening to this album.  It was the perfect music for that mood - being in a place where you were somewhat solitary and alone, and have time to delve into your own consciousness.  People who dismiss Blake as trash probably are better suited to listening to the mainstream radio, but for someone who utilizes music to accompany their own consciousness in an introspective fashion, then this album is a masterpiece of modern music.accompany their own consciousness in an introspective fashion, then this album is a masterpiece of modern music.
0688163173|4.0|Great story, fairly quick read, enjoyed the plot twists.  I liked that it kept me guessing but doesn't string you along to the point where it becomes obnoxious (e.g. \\"Girl With The Dragon Tattoo\\", where you feel like it should be done but there are still 200 pages left).  Still a couple of questions unanswered and a couple of seemingly pointless scenes (or maybe they provide a context I missed), hence my 4 instead of 5.  I appreciated the ending because I felt like it was the only one that would be appropriate.
0783240287|5.0|Joseph was not only given a Coat of Many Colors by Jacob, but, he received a gift from God of a life which was a \\"Coat of Many Colors...\\" and what he did with his life teaches us the power of Forgiveness, not always (or should I say ever) an easy task.  This musical is just a wonderful telling of Joseph's story and the tongue in cheek rendition of all the characters are smiles and more smiles.  A very pleasant experience to watch and you will want to pop this DVD in and escape over and over. Donny Osmond is perfect for the part of Joseph and that voice of his... and loved the Elvis Pharoah and the brothers....and the jail scene and Potipher and on and on....perfect in every way.  A MUST see!!

B00006RU5B|5.0|As a native Northwesterner(VIVA OREGON!!), I cannot diss Chris Cornell..I loved Soundgarden(and TOTD). I really was dissapointed when Soundgarden broke up in '97. However, I do love Audioslave, although it really didn't highlight Chris'<br />amazing vocal range('member \\"Rusty Cage\\" or \\"Mind riot\\"?) But having the rhythmic section of RATM to back him up was awesome..and  it showcased Tom Morello's incredible talent! An angry,disillusioned Zac, or a more subdued,intro-spective Chris..you decide!My fave track is \\"show me how to live\\" but\\"i am the highway\\" is up there for me also.Overall,I dig the album, and listen to it often( I would more oft, but when you have 130 cd's, it's hard to!!)Would I recommend? You bet!
B000FMGTTE|4.0|John Ottman did a solid job writing music for Superman Returns(2006). He borrows a few music cues from John Williams' music score for Superman The Movie(1978). This CD gives us the best of the music score. In the movie, there's a suspenseful music cue playing as Superman tries to save people and an earthquake tears up Metropolis! This music cue is not on the CD! In the movie theater in 2006, I was giddy with joy as we were given a roller coaster ride through the universe and John Williams' Superman theme music played in Digital Surround Sound and subwoofers. Ottman does an energetic cover of it. There's music from Superman The Movie as Lois Lane is reunited with Superman in an airplane that's stuck in a baseball field. Ottman's music score for Superman Returns has gotten some bad reviews. They claim it sounds too sappy. I enjoyed it. Ottman writes a brand new music cue for the evil, ego driven, megalomaniacal Lex Luthor. John Ottman's music score for Superman Returns works.
B0017UOU9Y|5.0|The first three Funkadelic albums (Funkadelic, Free Your Mind. . ., and Maggot Brain) are all amazing. The band morphs quite a bit after that and loses some of the rock edge that, to me, makes these early discs such an interesting mix. If you liked either of the other two, you'll like this. If you haven't experienced Funkadelic yet, I'd say start with the first album (Funkadelic) and then grab this disc, and free your funky mind!
B000IJ79WU|4.0|Superman(1978) and Superman II(1980) were filmed back to back. However, the producers and the director put most of their emphasis on the first Superman in order for it to make it to movie theaters in 1978. The budget ballooned out of control and director Richard Donner didn't get along with the producers. The producers let Donner go and they hired director Richard Lester(A Hard Day's Night) to complete Superman II(1980). Lester's style of directing is lighter than Donner's and it shows in Superman II and III. After years of demand from Superman fans, Warner Home Video released Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut in 2006! It's very, very different from the Superman II that people saw in 1980. Most of Lester's silly gags are gone and footage of Marlon Brando is put back in the film. Footage from screen tests from 1976 was used to fill in blanks. A VFX shot of Superman smashing into the Statue of Liberty is put back in! There's a chilling scene where General Zod shoots people with a gun for thrills! The footage of a defiled Mount Rushmore is gone. Margot Kidder looks robust and pretty in the Donner footage. In the Lester footage, she looks pale and sick! There's alternate angels of General Zod yelling at Jor-El. The scene with Lex Luthor and Otis in jail is longer. Sadly, the Richard Donner cut of Superman II is not as coherent as the Lester cut. Superman reverses time and space to keep the Kryptonian Outlaws from reaching Earth. However, the rude, violent trucker who beats up Clark Kent still recognizes him in the last half of the film! The patriotic scene with Superman delivering a new flag to the White House is not in this version! Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut is an interesting experiment and it is a must see for any Superman fan.
B002BU0DPE|2.0|Everything about this headset is excellent, except the right side broke where the cup attaches to the headband and when tried to repair with tape, the ear cup no longer fits against the ear. Others we know who own the same headset had the same thing happen to theirs. Too expensive to be disposable after only two months use. Poor overall quality.
0061478784|4.0|Let me start out by saying I love the movie version I have watched it over 100 times. Upon seeing the reviews about the book I decided to give it a try and I am happy I did. Reading the book after the movie gave me a chance to see the how amazing Hayao Miyazaki's imagination is.     The book was also well written kept me interested and I liked the character of Sophie in the book she had more to her that you didn't see in the movie. This was a quick read that I really enjoyed if you love the movie I would recommend taking a look at the book :)
014241722X|1.0|\\"A Time to Kill\\" was an amazing book.  \\"The Firm\\" was spectacular.  John Grisham has had several good books over the years; I've read them all.  He seems to have lost his touch.    I expected something like \\"The Firm\\" meets \\"A Painted House\\".  A new version of Encyclopedia Brown, where a clever child must use his resources in interesting ways.  This is far from what the book actually was.  Theodore Boone is a child who somehow knows every aspect of all criminal law.  He has a magic laptop with which he can somehow lookup anything about local proceedings at anytime.    The worst part of the book was that there was no creativity.  The book revolves around a murder.  I felt it was rather ambitious for Grisham to have a \\"Kid Lawyer\\" solve a murder; Grisham solves this problem in a most uninteresting way.  The key piece of evidence magically falls out of the sky into the kids lap.  And since this isn't enough plot to fill a book with, Grisham has a second magic piece of evidence fall out of the sky.  The book starts out great (about 20 pages).  Then there are about 200 pages of the kid worrying about what to do with the key pieces of evidence since he promised not to tell anyone.  Near the end, he reneges on his promise, tells his parents, and they fix this situation.     It's a horrible book.
0345529057|1.0|it's hard to write a review of this without letting spoilers slip, so if any do, sorry ahead of time.  i keep trying to write a review and i keep having to start over because i'm revealing too much.      i got these books because i caught a few minutes of the series on hbo, and was really looking forward to a good read.  i love fantasy fiction, especially political treachery and redemption stuff.  i was so seriously disappointed with this series.   realistic fantasy fiction is great for me - i don't want knights rescuing damsels and crap like that.  but this was too gritty and gross for me (and i have high thresholds for both!)     these books should come with a warning about the inappropriate sexual content and the abhorent, unnecessary violence.  you could tell this story without all the graphic dismemberment and the un-ending hacking off or biting off of nipples and boobs and noses and faces and ears and such.  honestly, you could.  it gets almost humorous.  you start wondering if everyone has to lose a limb or a bit or a part to exist in this world.      these books are not appropriate for anyone under 15 unless you want to be paying for therapy for your child.  the violence against women and children is couched in this \\"war makes men evil\\" psychology, but in reality, even the \\"good\\" characters that you are supposed to like and who are being nice, even they are being inappropriate, wanting to kiss and touch and have sex with really young girls.  i know some will argue that was appropriate for the \\"time\\", that kids were bred and married much younger than \\"now\\", but really, isn't that just justification for creepy perverts and old guys to fantasize about bedding young tweens?  gross.  learn to relate to women your own age.     the only half-way equal (both of them are adults) relationship between a male character and a female character is the incestuous relationship between siblings.  equal in that they both are in positions of power and working for their mutual benefit, sort of.  the overwhelming majority of the sex in these books is violent rape or money-based/power-based sex.  there is constant physical, verbal, psychological abuse of women and children, to the point that you start to wonder about the author as a person. is there no gentleness in his world because he doesn't believe in it?  is sex in his world always this one-sided?     setting all the sex and violence aside (which is damned difficult) he never gets ANYWHERE with the plot.  everyone is running in circles, wandering, in transit, in constant upheaval.  war settles nothing.  political marriage settles nothing.  death settles nothing. stuff that starts in book one does not get resolved by book four.  it just keeps going and going, transforming into deeper mires of nothing changing.  situations might change location but they never get resolved.  IS IT THAT HARD TO RESOLVE THINGS??  just when you think he resolves one plot, he brings in the whole resurrecting the dead stuff.  another complaint is that the same types of plots play out with several different characters, to the point that he's repeating himself, even with the sibling sexual tension stuff going on with two sets of siblings.      one major source of annoyance is that one of the main characters is a cross-gender mary sue that is all-powerful and perfect and beautiful, and everyone loves her, and all men want to sleep with her (even though she's all of 14). she just sorta walks through the books with the world bowing down at her feet, and doing wild and weird things that honestly become laughable at a certain point.  you know the sort??  \\"i'm the pretty elf princess, and i'm perfect and everyone loves me, and i have pet unicorns and dragons, and my eyes are purple, and i have long silky hair\\".  it's like a role play character so stacked with stats that they can never be hurt and they are practically a god. i got bored with her really fast, and started just flipping through her chapters, scanning without reading, because she was so unrealistic it was distracting and annoying.        what did i take away from these books?  this author hates women and wants to hurt them.  he has a boob fetish, maybe even a collection.  in  his world, grown adult women are evil and manipulative, and they are not to be trusted.  they are to be used sexually and killed if at all possible.  young girls that you can control are all any man should want.      storywise, what did i take away?  good people will perish because they are trying to do the right thing.  bad people will profit and advance because the old gods love bad people.  if bad people start to try and do good, they will be severely punished.  the only way to save the world from the advancing zombies and wights and evil people from the north appears to be through throwing off the old gods and accepting the one god, the god of light that is on the rise (yeah, by the way, i suspect this story is headed for jesus land - veneer of christianity not very cleverly hidden).  the message i got was: do evil and you will live.  do good and you'll die.  the one god is the way to go (even though his biggest proponent is an evil evil evil woman who dresses in red and is beautiful and makes every man around her want to sleep with her).      i honestly wanted to like this series, and the first book was okay because he didn't start getting into grossville right away.  i kept persevering because i wanted resolution.  if an author gets more than four thousand five hundred pages into a story and hasn't resolved stuff that started in book one, page one, then it's time to move on.  i held out hoping the characters i got attached to would get some resolution, or that evil people would finally get comeuppance, and nothing like this remotely happened.      i will not read any more of this author's books, not just because of the abhorent violence and inappropriate sexual content, but because NOTHING GETS RESOLVED, EVER.

0439023513|3.0|After devouring the Hunger Games books in under a week, I felt very empty.  The first two bittersweet books left hope for a happier end, which I expected would come in the third book, Mockingjay.  Instead, Mockingjay turned out to be a thesis against war with shattering effects on the characters, one in particular which left me crying even after I put the book down.  Since the first two books were about breaking the system, I didn't expect the system to break the characters at the end.  I'm glad I didn't read other reviews of Mockingjay in advance because I wouldn't have wanted to know the plot, but I think it's worth knowing that it's very sad.      The end of Mockingjay made me think about the importance of supporting our veterans and how we as a community can help them live better lives and recover after the horrible things that they have seen.  Here, I would like to plug The Mission Continues, a non-profit that empowers wounded and disabled veterans to recover begin new lives of public service.  I have donated to them in the past and this book has encouraged me to do so again.
0307595862|2.0|While I (sort of, mostly) enjoyed the book, and Harry Hole, I can't get past or forgive a gaping plot hole which had the additional effect of making the usually intelligent Hole look like a dope.  It was so obvious to me who the killer was that I thought it had to be a misdirection (it wasn't).  Ruined the book for me.
1439181780|5.0|I have just finished reading The Power and so many light bulbs are now switched on,it feels like a whole new refreshing change is sweeping through me.Very exciting,I know how Rip van Winkle must have felt.I am now reading it again.
B004WJRDN2|4.0|I am a McCartney fan sure enough, obviously I am going to buy the \\"Deluxe\\" versions of his solo recordings. I am going to buy them because I really like the idea of the \\"books\\" and the updated audio. I pre-ordered both I & II straight away. I will get to the point, if you are buying McCartney don't do it if you are excited for the \\"bonus\\" disc.    McCartney has never been one to let his guard down and I would say with good reason. The Beatles would never have made it if they would have, and, McCartney would have either.    Now I may be contradicting myself here, because, McCartney, Wild Life and McCartney II, were all very, very out of the norm for him. So I was thinking, \\"Hey\\", the outtakes from this album should be as far out as the idea itself, but, in this case it is the very opposite; the tracks are very \\"ordinary and somewhat obvious\\". I don't need two versions of \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\" and since he opted to use the song for the bonus disc it could have at been and acoustic first or second run at the song. It is rather short, I guess 2 more hours wouldn't have been enough either but I think rather than using \\"live stuff\\" from Glasgow, 1979 they should be at least from the era, that what makes  bonus tracks interesting, for instance \\"what didn't make it on the record and why\\"? \\"Suicide\\", \\"Woman Kind\\" are cool because they were from the period and didn't make the record.    I really like the audio, I like the package as a whole, I think that it is worth it without the bonus disc. The photos put you right in your place, Linda was fabulous. This record is a very important piece of musical history,I mean this took guts to release because of the circumstances at the time. You just left one of the most important and influential piece of music history and released your first solo album, recorded in a living room to a very unforgiving and unfair public.    I think that the thought behind this record was in fact \\"ahead of it's time\\". I like this offering because it is honest and the first piece of the puzzle, the scrapbook so to speak.    This is certainly not his best record, but, is a better document of history. \\"Fine\\" Paul & Linda McCartney, your gonna take the world your way.......and God bless you for doing it.
0525422943|3.0|This second book is still very heavily laden with the music world. I was actually surprised that the book was not titled Where They Went as the story is told from Adam's point of view and the direction that he had taken after Mia's accident and then briefly for a couple of chapters Mia's story is told. The majority of the book is really Adam's situations, feelings and travels since Mia had left. Although of course through him her story is eventually told it really is Adams' story.<br />The fact that this story is told from Adams viewpoint is what actually got my attention and curiosity after reading the first book to see where the story went. Adam was my favorite character from the first book and he and his rock band style was more appealing to me than Mia's classical side.<br />I thought maybe we might see that rockstar side of Adam, the love of performing for people and the intense emotions that come from performing on stage and travelling. But Adams' story was full of depression, anxiety, saddness and hate for the situation he was in, like he was just following the motions to get through another day.<br />The author is obviously incredible at describing emotions and scenes that you can place yourself in the story very easily. Overall these books are very touching, but very sad.
B003INBNXO|5.0|A co-worker loaned me a copy to watch.  Wonderful.  The setting, China before and during World War Two, was very researched.  The men, women, and even children, all perfectly selected and played their parts wonderfully - even the Japanese actors.  The drama, history and, yes, even romance came out without being over done.  This is not just some fist-fight movie, with lots of blood, gore, and some message about being a Man.  This is a film about being an individual, picking your path, and not letting anybody make choices for you.  And has cool fights with blood and gore.  It is about being with family, supporting friends, and about protecting the most important thing about life - your right to plan how you wish to live it.
1401923119|5.0|This is a very well thought out book which fully explains scientific concepts clearly for the non-scientist.

B004ZH66XO|5.0|This is game is simple to understand and does not need a long tutorial to figure out. Its best aspect is the desire for improvement, meaning the player always wants a bigger and faster fish. The game has an variety of powerups the player can use to catch prey or avoid predators. Money can be collected to in order to buy upgrades, which improve powerups. This game is not the first of its kind, but is very original. Definitely repayable.
B001JRB16U|3.0|This movie reminds me of the need to decolonize from European culture. For one thing, their nannies remind me of our housemaids/houseboys in Nigeria. This is not to say that every Nigerian had/has a housemaid/houseboy. The film just reminds me that they imposed their culture on us. Mr. Banks is glorifying British colonization with his colleagues in the bank. Because of this scene, I sold my copy even though the sales associate cheated me. The truth is that they stay true to history, but it's still annoying to watch. On a lighter note, it is a good family film. The kids make you want to be a kid no matter how old you are because you want to have as much fun as they're having and their mother is an advocate for women's rights, which is fantastic. She's also a good mother/wife and she takes good care of the nannies. It's a fun-filled film for all ages. The soundtrack is also good (except the one at the bank for the reason I mentioned above), but I hate that it glorifies British colonization in Africa. It just shouldn't have occurred.?!
B004EPYZPS|4.0|Four somewhat geeky jr. high kids opt to make a zombie movie. Joe (Joel Courtney) is one of them. His mother has recently died and his dad (Kyle Chandler) is a deputy who is semi-understanding. Charles (Riley Griffiths) is the brains behind the film. Alice (Elle Fanning) agrees to help them with the movie. After midnight, she drives the foursome to the scene. She doesn't have a license and is worried because the deputy's son is with them. Joe promises not to tell. One boy, Cary, has a love for fire and fireworks. Alice's father (Ron Eldard) gets in trouble with the law. Her relationship with Joe is not welcomed by him. This develops into a background Romeo and Juliet scenario, something for the young teen girl appeal.<br /><br />As they are rehearsing a scene at the station, a train is coming down the tracks. Charles scrambles to get a film clip of the train while shooting the scene. Then it happens: a white pick-up truck speeds by the train. There is a wreak. The kids panic and run for their lives as RR cars explode all around them. When the smoke clears they take a quick headcount. There are things which look like a white Rubik's cubes all around them.<br /><br />Charles recognizes the driver of said white truck; it is his fourth period biology teacher, Dr. Woodward (Glynn Turman, a black man with a PhD. in biology teaching middle school in white suburban Lillian, Ohio). In his near dying breath the teacher instructs the kids not to say anything or else they and their families will be hunted down and killed! As GI Joe shows up at the scene, the kids grab their equipment and speed out of there...and they take one of the cubes.<br /><br />The Air Force has taken charge of the clean up. The town's people are kept away and in the dark. Then weird things start to happen...Sheriff goes missing, dogs go missing, car engines go missing, microwaves go missing. There is clearly a \\"monster\\" thing on the loose, but the camera doesn't let us see it, very similar to many of the Jurassic Park/ Predator scenes. I wish I had seen this on IMAX. There are a number of scenes where things suddenly \\"jump out at you.\\" This always makes it fun for a bunch of kids at the theater.<br /><br />Spielberg/ Adams bring out the best in the child actors making them very convincing and realistic. The humor is pointed at kids. When Alice asks how to be a zombie, Joe tells her to act like their English teacher. The movie contains numerous anachronisms: Rubik's cube and Walkman came out in 1980 while the movie takes place in 1979. Elle Fanning is asked to play a number of different parts in this film, and she does them all well. I felt like I was watching her audition tape.<br /><br />At some point in time the hippie (store clerk who tries to sell Charles pot) lets out a WTF. Here we have a film clearly aimed at kids and they drop the F-bomb in it. There was absolutely no need for it. They made the rating unwatchable for the target audience which is also financially irresponsible.<br /><br />5 stars for middle school kids who outwit the military and save the day/ 3 stars for adults who sit through it.or scenes.

B0050PYNO4|2.0|I am a huge fan of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, love their other movies... I am not a Seth Rogen fan(other than Knocked Up and Superbad) and his director friends just seem to wanna carry his shtick for as long as they can, even if its animated. You can really see he tries to hard and has to swear even more to pry laughs out....     Other than that, he does not necessarily drag the movie down, its pretty much the most unfunny movie of the Pegg and Frost movies. It has laughs here and there and unfortunately I laughed harder in one scene without any of the 3 main stars. Its a rental but don't get your expectations up.

0316056863|3.0|I didn't laugh enough to piss my pants, but I did chuckle a lot when I read Tina Fey's memoir, Bossypants. Her comedic talent works well in print, but not nearly as well as when it's visual. Any reader who likes Tina Fey will find a lot to enjoy on these pages, and most will come away with the conclusion that this woman is very busy. My favorite description was the weekend where three events had to be accomplished with no room for error: Oprah's taping of 30 Rock, Tina's first portrayal of Sarah Palin on SNL, and her daughter's birthday party. I don't think I give anything away by saying all were accomplished on that busy weekend.<br /><br />Rating: Three-star (Recommended)
B004EPYZPS|3.0|Am I the only one who thought this movie under-delivered, was over-hyped, and was unnecessarily bloated with foul language?<br /><br />I guess seeing Steven Spielberg's name conjured up in my mind a warm, climax-building, plot-developing Saturday afternoon kid-flick, with a memorable soundtrack, and a terrific ending that would make me walk out of the theater amazed, and with an 'how'd they do that?' admiration.<br /><br />For my matin&eacute;e money I got more foul language than memorable lines, an Alien-esque monster that I could develop neither sympathy nor hate for, and a not-so-epic conclusion that made me ask the question: 'who the heck cares?'<br /><br />I won't rehash the plot. It's the standard-fare government cover-up (Close Encounter of the Third Kind) of the presence of an alien creature we are supposed to both fear and pity. The thing wants to go home (ET but with none of the warmth), and does more stomping and smashing than anything else.<br /><br />The alien finally turns the water tower in Lillian, Ohio into a gigantic magnet which shape-shifts car engines, microwaves, a kid's locket and bikes into a spaceship. With the drama of a donut, the creature climbs aboard and goes home, and there you have it. End of Story.<br /><br />While the kid actors are wonderful, and Spielberg shows again he knows the ways of adolescents well, we don't get to know them as thoroughly as we might hope.<br /><br />Other than the loss of a mom, a pot-smoking dad, dysfunctional family relationships and the conflicts extant between most all parents and kids, there's not a lot else to make us love the little band of Super 8 filmmakers. They are creative to be sure, and we have the expected boy/girl crush thrown in, but other than the scene 'filmed' at the train crash, the kids are not memorable.<br /><br />Also left underdeveloped in plot and unanswered as questions are: why, specifically, is it the dogs who run away? Where is the alien from and why is it really here? Why does it store humans upside down in the hole (they seem to serve no purpose)? Was there a point at all to the lady with the curlers in her hair? Couldn't we develop more rapport between the alien and the kids?<br /><br />In short, the explosions and sparklers are nice, but nothing spectacular anymore. The period music is OK, and disco references, Walkman, and old Kodak cameras are nostalgic. But if you're looking for a fast-paced plot like Raiders, a spectacular conclusion like Close Encounters, or the charm and warmth of ET, you won't find it here. Just some foul-mouthed kids, an estranged alien with an attitude, and some explosions to keep you awake.<br /><br />If this movie is 'memorable', our standard for Saturday afternoon adventure has been significantly lowered.

B0025UHKNS|5.0|Great stuff to improve training. Helps you tracking your distances, not requiring to follow pre-analysed distances. Leaves you free to run where you want. And helps you improving time, as it displays you pace every km.  The web based software gives a great view of pace, HR, calories burnt... Easy to use.  It´s not large, justa  little larger than a regular watch. Do not bores you when runnning.    Only 2 negative points:  -Use of watch is not user frindly. You need to read the manual.  -The web based software does not track your shoes mileage. For us runners, it´s  a very important information. I don´t know if another watch does it.    I recommend!  Have a nice run!!
B000BVMAJ2|5.0|This is a very cute lego set for little kids new to lego.  It's not a very complex set and can be used in addition to other sets.  The animals are very cute and any little kid who loves animals will be delighted by this set.

B004ZGI2KK|1.0|I wish I could give this a good review.  It has the bones of a good film, but is destroyed by really bad acting and archetypal characters.  Also the metaphor of the story of Little Red Riding Hood is totally lost.  I wouldn't say the ending is predictable, just boring.  Could have been much better.  I mean no on really cares who the wolf is by the end, just that the movie end soon to put you out of your misery.  one star is all this deserves.
B004EPYZPS|5.0|It's rare that a film comes along about kids and has a science fiction touch yet communicates the joys and the frustrations of growing up than Super 8.<br /><br />Super 8 was apparently billed as a disaster film with aliens, etc. In truth, it's not about the alien at all. It's about kids growing up in a rural town, trying to do something special with themselves.<br /><br />My Impressions:<br /><br />The film starts out with a funeral. A child loses his mother early on. A man comes over and is immediately thrown out of the house! Right here you wonder what the heck is going on!<br /><br />We find out soon enough. I think I found the story within the story of what Abrams was trying to do. It's semi-autobiographical. Spielberg and Abrams were both into making films as kids and it stuck.<br /><br />The actual filmmaking was fun to see: they set up with funky scripts, a zombie who just would not stay dead, and a kid who wanted \\"production value\\" in all his shots! However, a train wreck, a fallen camera and an Area 51 scientist who also happened to be their science teacher changed all that.<br /><br />The train wreck special effects were amazing and horrific. The look on the love-struck kid when he thought Alice was dead was heart-touching.<br /><br />Favorite Scenes:<br /><br />Father's Faith:<br /><br />Without giving too much away, our hero discovers a film that was made with his mother when he was growing up. Alice sits with him in his room as the power comes on. The scenes project and Alice begins to cry, realizing that if her father took that shift at the steel mill that day, the tragic accident that took his mother \\"should have\\" taken her father.<br /><br />The theme of dysfunctional parents that actually do love their children and overcoming that dysfunctional was great to see.<br /><br />Amateur Horror Film:<br /><br />During the credits we actually get to see the full film that the kids were making, right down to the pipe and the armchair, the zombie and the chemical plant, etc. Fun to watch!<br />I actually did something like this myself when I was 17 or so.<br /><br />Music!<br /><br />The memories of the late 70s came back to me. The music and the excitement are really great.<br /><br />Hackneyed Themes:<br /><br />Yes there were some \\"I've seen this before\\" themes of government abuse, secrets, abducting the alien (!), it escapes, the misunderstood scientist, the innocent children that make it right while the adults are clueless.<br /><br />But it's HOW Abrams and Spielberg put these themes together, with a few twists (the fathers' involvement) and the success these filmmakers did in recreating the time period, the attitudes, the 1950s horror alien invasion Grade B style, that makes this film so charming.<br /><br />Bottom Line: There are some scenes where the kids swear like truck drivers; it's not a lot but parents should know. Highly recommend this film, especially for those who grew up in the 70s, enjoyed Journey and Blondie, and loved the film E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial. The trailers make believe this film is a typical invasion story. That's done on purpose. It's a coming of age story that is charming in its execution. Highly recommended.<br /><br />Cast & Crew:<br /><br />Director:<br />J.J. Abrams<br /><br />Producer:<br />Steven Spielberg<br /><br />Writer:<br />J.J. Abrams<br /><br />Stars:<br />Elle Fanning, Amanda Michalka and Kyle Chandlermical plant, etc. Fun to watch!<br />I actually did something like this myself when I was 17 or so.<br /><br />Music!<br /><br />The memories of the late 70s came back to me.

B003LR4QPE|5.0|Excellent occasion to have it all in one for an unbeatable price. I listened to a few of the CDs and find them of excellent quality.
0345529057|5.0|Worth the 20 dollars ever spent. I recommend people should read these books before watching the show. I have not seen the TV show yet because I'm still reading book 2.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Beautilful Disaster is a MUST READ! I devoured this book in a day. When I wasn't reading it I was constantly thinking about it. Everything about this book is perfect. The cover art, the characters who come alive on the pages, to feeling the characters emotions as if you yourself were there with them! Beautiful Disaster has replaced Twlight as my favorite book! I want more, more, more. I think I could read a million more books about Abby and Trev! So my advice to any who might be reading my review, you won't be disappointed so stop wondering if you should buy this book already and DO IT! Even though i finished it today I plan on rereading it tonight however I'm savoring every page and taking my time! Happy reading'
B001C3KCSY|5.0|From the first second one realizes it´s an interesting material... But it gets better and better. Great R&R tunes, specially the guitar solos, and the mix of high energy songs with balads. Of course, this is the record of the Grammy award winner \\"Use Somebody\\" wich is just the perfect hint to start listening to this. An amazing album by the Kings indeed!
B001EN71DG|1.0|Somebody should sue George Lucas for continuously reboxing these movies with misleading titles to make the public think they are the \\"Original\\".  I, like many, fell prey to it one time many years ago, and sold them almost immediately.  But unlike many, I haven't bought any since.  Until the money hungry George Lucas puts the original undoctored versions on DVD or blu-ray, I won't be buying them again.  I'm shocked that people are buying this set, and thinking it's a good deal, just to get 3 of the butchered versions that will just end up in the trash.  Really?  $110 for the 3 movies that you really want?  I just don't get it people.  Stop playing his game.  It's not until we stop buying the doctored versions period, and demand the originals by themselves, in a set, will he listen.  Until we affect the profits, we will not be heard.
B001HN69B8|1.0|I tried to watch this film, I really did. If for no other reason but to see Heath Ledger's last performance. Well, what a waste of time and effort. What a mess of confusion, violence, and depressing images. I couldn't figure out what was going on, no matter where I picked up the film, at different scenes when it was of cable. It just never went anywhere, unless you count all of over the place, going somewhere. It was really a waste of time, also for the great actor Christopher Plummer. I can't figure out why any of the fine actors in this film signed on-especially the ones who filled in for Ledger after his death. And why three of them? To make the storyline, whatever it was, seem more confusing, weird, creepy and depressing? Well, mission accomplished then. If there are people out there, who justify this film with the prhase, 'this is my kind of weird', then that is what they are signing on for by watching this film. Some kind of weird-the worst kind!
0743289692|5.0|Hirsi Ali provides readers with a view of the daily life of Muslim women in her own story of growing up in this society. She records her mother's frustration due to her husband's long absences. Hirsi Ali's father was involved in trying to establish a sound government in Somalia. Her mother's stress without a man to support her family, and reliance on financial help from tribal members, often took its toll on her children with frequent beatings. As Hirsi Ali grew into a young woman, she began to question the restrictions Islam placed on her and other women, wearing the veil, denial of freedom of movement, etc. She manages to escape from an arranged marriage and find shelter in Holland, where she finds a government that welcomes refugees. She learns Dutch, goes to college, and eventually becomes a member of the Dutch parliament. She makes it her mission to educate Muslim women about their rights in an effort to free them from the unjust domination of men in Islam. The recent news about women in Saudi Arabia protesting the ban on women drivers is a hopeful sign.
B004VBAHG6|4.0|Having stumbled into the fact of this release while looking for a new copy of \\"Holy Smoke\\"  (my personal fave among his solo stuff); I took amazon up on the free pre-release listen.  It grabbed me immediatley.  Always a rock fan, I welcome new stuff from old acts who  know their stuff.  What succeeds in \\"Ninth\\" is the energy and catchiness of some of the   songs; particularly \\"velocity bird\\" and \\"seesaw sway\\"--have had one or the other going   around in my head all week.  What doesn't work for me is the nod to Goth \\"secret silk society\\"  and his pitchy vocals on the final cut \\"creme de la creme\\".  However, that doesn't bother me  much, because it IS a passionate performance...  So overall, it's worth it, and good to have  him back in the limelight.  Have been enjoying his updates within Facebook for this album, too.  Just a good rock album all around, not great, but entertaining!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|One of better games on the market. A nice sequel from the other Angry Birds games. Very cool and easy to play...Droid X (froyo)
B003YK42LQ|5.0|Definetly the old saying \\"better in time\\" applies to Come Around Sundown by Kigs of Leon. The lyrics are multilayerd, with an introspective vibe. Throughout the whole record one gets the sense that is navigating between both country and rock ground but always with the clear sound that identifies this band. Rock festivals material for sure!!!  This one just can´t be missed!
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Loving the game do far. Would give it 5 stars except that it occasionally freeze, and will not move/quit, likely due to a background notification. Only way to solve that is to hard restart my Captivate, by removing the battery. Otherwise it is an excellent game...
B0002O7XVI|4.0|If I had viewed this beautifully filmed version of TESS without knowing who the director was, never in my wildest dreams would I have guessed it was Roman Polanski! It is very different from his other films. Of course Polanski is a versitile director. Anyone who could go from THE TENANT to FEARLESS VAMPIRE KILLERS (a masterpiece of the comedy-horror genre) has got to be multifaceted artistically. Reading the negative reviews of TESS confirmed the opinion that many Amazon reviewers react more emotionally than rationally. TESS is totally UNLIKE any other Polanski production.<br /><br />It's more BBC's Masterpiece Theatre than ROSEMARY'S BABY.<br /><br />Nastassia Kinski is, of course, physically beautiful, but it is her \\"inner self\\" that captivates in the film. Her Tess is so completely understated--and this is where other reviewers may have a problem with this production--as to be ephemeral. Despite her beauty there is an illusive quality to the characterization. She's more spirit than flesh & blood. It's as if Tess advances through life with the forgone (perhaps, subconcious) conclusion of being ultimately doomed. This is so close to Thomas Hardy's vision of fate, that I'm surprised most negative reviewers either missed it or just didn't want to see because they had a pre-existing bias against Polanski. This isn't the place to go into RP's legal woes; suffice it to say that he was more set-up than predatory.<br /><br />I thought the script still needed some work in showing motivation. I agree with reviwers who felt details of Tess' relationship are too truncated. For example, the whole \\"baby thing\\" happens so fast, it's almost like Tess never had a baby. However, this may be part of Polanski's intent on not wanting the audience to wallow in wet, 3 hanky emotion--a feature that overall I appreciated. He didn't want to create a melodrama bloated with nudity & sex scenes.<br /><br />In ways--some obvious, some not so obvious--TESS reminded me of ELIVRA MADIGAN, another impressionistic style film about a compellingly strange & doomed heroine.<br /><br />Here's a little heretical hint: The TESS I screened was a 1 Disk Director's Cut version available from Netflix--and, despite being passed around like a village hussy, it was in a spotlessly pristine condition with outstanding cinematography & exhibited none of the problems some reviewers complained about. It would be nice if there was more consistency in the film reproduction industry.ut a compellingly strange & doomed heroine.

Read it. Refer back to it. Love it!

B004VFYPTW|5.0|For all fans of whitesnake this double cd and dvd of the same concert is a must have.  First as you can probably tell by the title this is an old concert, from 1990 to be exact.  This line up of Whitesnake is definatly one of the best line-ups ever. It Features Obviously David Coverdale on Vocals.  Then the top notch band from there is Steve Vai and Adrian Vandenberg on Co- Lead Guitars. The rhythm section features Tommy Aldrigde on Monster Drums.  And Bass player Extrodianare is legendary Rudy Sarzo.  They also have tour Keyboardist Rick Serate as well.  Let me tell you this is a raw live concert. The sound is unreal as they were able to take the old recordings and make a modern Live rock album.  The video is only footage from the actual concert.  For those that don't know, at rock concerts very often they have large screens where they show footage of the band, well this is the video as they never  properly recorded the video for this concert in the first place.  However the CD portion of this concert more than makes up for the DVD part.  Excellent band and excellent concert. 5 stars.

B0034G4ORC|2.0|Aaron Eckhart (\\"Thank You For Smoking;\\" also on \\"Frasier\\" he was Laura Linney's boyfriend during the episode \\"And Frasier Makes Three\\") portrays a Staff Sergeant who leads a small platoon of Marines into enemy occupied downtown Los Angeles joined by Tech Sergeant Michelle Rodriguez (\\"Avatar;\\" \\"The Fast and the Furious;\\" \\"Resident Evil;\\" and \\"Machete\\"), to retrieve stranded civilians including Bridget Moynahan (\\"iRobot;\\" also on several episodes of \\"Blue Bloods\\" tv series), after which the entire group struggles to survive as they battle invading aliens who are colonizing the earth by lethal force.  The FX aren't bad, the action is non-stop, and other than the typical shaky camera nonsense that some movie directors think adds realism to military films, the only thing besides a steady hand holding the camera that could have improved this film would have been some female nudity.  The PG-13 rating is for violence and language.  A PG-13 rating says, \\"Unless you're under 14 years old, you not only are familiar with violence and language, you probably contribute to it.\\"  As if the under 13 and under crowd are as innocent as lambs.  &lt;ahem>  Anyway, Marines from Camp Pendleton trained the actors for this film, and there are some actual Marines in some of the footage.  There are also US Air Force and US Army personnel, but primarily the focus is upon the Marines.  Interestingly enough, the film was made in Louisiana, and images of Los Angeles were inserted by CGI later.  The movie is burdened with war clich&eacute;s and choppy transitions that only action junkies can overlook; which is why the film \\"Rango\\" made this film drop to #2 slot a week after \\"Battle: Los Angeles\\" debuted when \\"Rango\\" premiered.  There isn't much that is brand new in this film, and many critics compare this film to previous war movies as if the impropriety of plagiarism was obnoxiously blatant in the making of \\"BLA\\" and I guess I just didn't care whether or not those accusations are legitimate.  What I care about most is why do the marketing people for this film automatically assume we want it to happen by them saying that Aaron Eckhart has said he is willing to appear in a sequel.  Sci-Fi management needs some new blood at the top I think.  There has to be more than US military fighting against alien invasion.  I could come up with better film making ideas than this stinker.  With colleges bragging about how much education can change your world, why are we being dished out the same old hash?about most is why do the marketing people for this film automatically assume we want it to happen by them saying that Aaron Eckhart has said he is willing to appear in a sequel.

This one piqued my interest immediately, but I still lost it in the hectic mess that is my life. Slid right by me in the theaters and I wasn't aware of the dvd release. Luckily, a friend stumbled on it by chance and thought it might be the kind of thing I'd be in to. He was so right. I absolutely loved it. The performances were fantastic and the story dark and touching. I'm so glad I didn't let this one get away.

B004S5D3B6|5.0|Excellent movie. I thoroughly enjoyed this twice.  Christian Bale is obviously a very talented and versatile  actor. It says that it stars Mark Wahlberg and co-stars  Bale but Bale is quite the scene-stealer & obvious star  in this. Mark is good too as always but continues to play  the same roles repeatedly; however the comedy he was in  not long ago was excellent where he was the co-star and surprised  us all with a new type of role.    I highly recommend this movie.  (sorry, but the title of the  comedy with Mark excapes me right now).
B000ZNRBK4|5.0|It is a shame that my D5000 + kit lens did not come with this already.  I tried an off brand tulip that screwed on but you could see the hood in the frame as it was not designed for my lens.  This one may be small but I like how it snaps on and is easy to remove.  With the addition of this hood it also makes it easier to manually focus when shooting video or for still shots.
B002VKE0XA|5.0|Blair Witch introduced the \\"mockumentary\\" style horror movie.  ie, you pretend that what you're watching is the long lost camcorder footage of someone who was the victem of some supernatural horror.  Paranormal Activity is such a movie.  In my opinion, the only good one out of the bunch of knockoffs.  I give this movie and \\"Cloverfield\\" 5 stars.  The rest about 2 stars.    I think there is such a divide in ratings because either your imagination gets jumpstarted and you love it, or it doesn't and its a waste of 1.5 hours of your life that you'll never get back.  For me, it worked and I loved it.  What makes this movie different (since I don't like anything else in this genre)?    First, they won't contrive a flimsy backstory.  If you explain too much in horror, its not horror.  Its just a problem to solve.  One character calls the entity a 'demon.'  Maybe he's right.  Either way, that's as much background as you're going to get.  Oh, you do see its foot prints.  And that's when the movie had me.  I assumed they'd show unimaginative human footprints.  But they didn't.  That makes the baddie \\"something else.\\"  And \\"something else\\" is as creepy as it gets.    Second, I complement the characters for the very reasons that so many disparage them.  All these complaints about how the movie is bad because \\"I would have acted smarter.\\"  Other than James Bond, since when is the problem solving skills of a character an indication of a good movie?  Sure.  I can name 50 mistakes the main characters made.  I would have acted completely different.  But a movie showing how I successfully avoided danger would make a great instructional video, but an absolutely abysmal horror movie.  As long as I can believe that there exists even one person in this world who would act like these characters, then suspension of disbelief is satisfied.    Third, I get that there's no classic \\"plot\\" in this movie.  You can't make a flow chart with dozens of entries showing a flow of cause and effects leading to revelations.  But, unlike most of these \\"mockumentary\\" horror films, there actually are moments of cause and effect, and charater vs entity interactions, which lead to unhealthy outcomes (yes, I'm avoiding spoilers like mad).  And that's plot.  And while subtle, its enough for me, and done better than other similar films.    And yeah, don't expect a special effects fest.  And not much will objectively happen for half the film.  It can't.  Any good movie has a ramp up.  And given this style the ramp up has to be slow.  Does anyone remember Jaws?  I love that movie.  But you don't see the shark for the first hour there, either.  Ok, spoiler:  Much like Jaws, you don't see any sharks in the first hour of Paranormal Activity.    How scary?  I can't review that.  The only movie that ever scared me was \\"The Omen,\\" and only because I saw it when I was five.  I watch horror movies to stimulate my imagination.  And this movie does that better than 95% of the horror movies out there, and on 5% of the budget.    And for all my praise, I don't recommend the sequel at all.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I don't usually play games on my droid incredible, but I find myself drawn back to this one time and again.  only annoyance is the slow loading time, and need to reload every time screen is blanked out.
B00005KHJM|5.0|The shorter version of the film is what we usually get on television, but I was lucky enough to get the longer version on VHS.  While the VHS version definitely makes more sense, I found something peculiar between the two cuts.  I noticed that after the Bret Ekland seduction scene on the shorter version, the following morning cuts to her & the Sergeant in his room where a little dialog takes place.  She inquires as to his refusal to take her up on her \\"invitation\\" the night before, at which time he confesses to being a virgin.  This little tidbit of information reinforces the reason he has been chosen.  This scene does not appear in the longer version, but instead after her attempt at seduction, cuts to the scene which occurs AFTER the Ekland-Sergeant scene in the shorter one.  Via editing, I now have my own compete version!
B0034JKZ86|5.0|Wow! Everytime I watch this movie something new comes out. Its is such a fantastic movie. The music is great, the characters are well drawn and move fluidly, and its not too long or too short. I strongly recommend checking it out!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I can't wait for the release of the entire Saga on BD. It's going to be amazing! I've been a die-hard Star Wars fan since the release of the original trilogy in theatres, and have had the original trilogy on every consumer video format it's been released on (Beta, VHS, Laserdisc & DVD).    Regarding the original trilogy, when they restored all three films for the 1997 re-release in theatres, after the prints where cleaned, they scanned all three films at 4k resolution and then did the digital clean-up and additions. The BD releases are starting with the 4k remastered digital negatives. I am fully confident that they will all look absolutely incredible and can't wait for the new lossless audio soundtracks, commentary and 40+ hours of extra material as well.
B004N66XYE|3.0|Excellently done, but not enough of it.  If you watched the original 'Upstairs, Downstairs' you'll enjoy this shorter version, but you'll find yourself hoping to see Mr Hudson, or Mrs. Bridges!  Yet this version does pay homiage to them in clever little ways.  If you enjoyed the original series, you'll enjoy this one too.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This game is so entertaining!  I'm actually motivated to keep playing it, unlike most other games that don't keep my attention.  Graphics and audio are really good, and the game has a good sense of humor, too.  More engaging and attention- keeping than Angry Birds.
0062060554|3.0|Every day Christine awakens to an unfamiliar world.  The room she has been sleeping in is one she doesn't remember, the clothes she sees looks as if they belong to someone else, even her face in the mirror seems wrong.  Every day her husband Ben must patiently explain to Christine all over again who she is.  But can she trust Ben?  A doctor has become interested in her case and meets with her frequently.  Is he trustworthy?  The doctor is encouraging her to keep a journal, but can she trust what she's written?  Whether she can trust it or not, it offers her the only hope she has of any continuity in her fragmented life.<br /><br />This is, needless to say, a high concept novel, and for most of the book I found the concept so engaging I was willing to overlook the glaring improbabilities.  Watson writes quite well, and the philosophical issues are interesting - the relationship of memory and identity, memory and our connections to other people, and the ways in which we construct our realities.  But could Christine really have received frequent phone calls from her doctor without Ben finding out?  Would she have had time to do as much reading and writing in her journal as she is supposed to have done? And, again, without Ben finding out?<br /><br />When a book is teetering between improbability and probability, it's very disappointing to see it crash into improbability at the end, but this is what \\"Before I Go to Sleep\\", alas, does.  There is an especially ludicrous instance of journal reading during the climactic scene, simply eye-rollingly implausible.  The ending is predictable, but melodramatic, hasty, and quite unlikely.  (And why did people suddenly stop answering their phones?  Did I miss something?).  A big anticlimax.
140131046X|3.0|I have read three of Mitch Albom's other novels and couldn't put them down.  This one though falls short for me.  The book is not poorly written, but I just didn't get a feeling that the story was really heading anywhere.  As I got to know Reb and Henry, and the very different paths their lives had taken, I kept waiting for Mr. Albom to bring them together.  Never happened for me.  I've actually gone back and read some of the 4/5 star reviews to see if I've missed something.  I've always had a very strong faith in God, but never considered myself 'religious'.  I did appreciate the Reb's outlook on life and his complete and total acceptance of others who chose to worship God differently.  I loved his philosophy on why God created only one man in the beginning as a lesson to us that we all come from one God.  He was a very insightful man.  Though this book did not make a deep and lasting impression on me, I do look forward to Mr. Albom's next book.
B0034G4ORM|4.0|What more can I say, I went into this movie with few expectations, and I must say I was completely surprised at the final result that was delivered. This is a very solid, action film, but at the heart of it, it has a story, strong character development and a satisfactory ending. If you ever wondered what the love child of Independence Day and Black Hawk Down would be, it is this movie. Though, somewhat heavy on the action, I was pleased that it didnt over-do the gore, in fact there was little to no gore in the movie whatsoever. Most films like this rely too heavily on shock value to keep its audience, Battle Los Angeles relies solely on story telling. I highly recommend this movie if you get the chance, it was an enjoyable ride I was glad I took.
B0034G4ORC|1.0|The movie is completely disjointed; the \\"story\\" line is iffy (at best), the dialogue childish, trite, boring... the acting is simply horrible... should I go on? After about 40 minutes we all wanted to just turn the \\"stupid thing off... PLEASE!\\". But then we took a different tack and approached the whole thing as a MAJOR SPOOF. We then started enjoying the supremely bad acting, moronic dialog, barely tolerable special effects for what we assumed it was meant to be: a FARSE a COMEDY! We had a few belly splitting laugh sessions at the expense of the poor (as in pitiful) actors, but MUCH to EVERYONE'S RELIEF it finally ended. Do as you wish (in terms of purchase) but if you call me you can have my copy FOR FREE!!!
0307595862|1.0|The killer has the victim cornered, but unfortunately for the killer the victim has an ax, and she manages to sever the killer's artery before running off into the woods.  The killer considerately bleeds a little, just to leave a clue, you know, and then runs after the victim through the snowy woods for a long way without bleeding any more at all.  With a severed artery?  And no one notices at all that the killer has sustained a major wound.<br /><br />And so it goes in this stupid, stupid book.  Two investigators search a cabin for no particular reason, and you know they're going to make a startling discovery since they have no reason for the search.  A character attacks someone in a particularly gruesome manner, and then this strange attack somehow becomes insignificant.  And the killer ..I mean, if you just analyze which character is going to give the author the trashiest possible bang for his buck, its perfectly obvious who the killer is.  The all-too-obvious killer behaves in a manner that is inconsistent with the killer's past behavior (unlike a real-life serial killer), and, again, it's purely in the interest of trashy bang for the buck.<br /><br />I loathe books like this.  The characters are cliche. There is no emotional development whatsoever.  The only thing the book has to offer is paint-by-the-numbers reader manipulation.  I had the impression that Nesbo isn't particularly interested in his characters himself; his only interest is in creating dramatic scenes, no matter how empty-headed and improbable.  Reading something like this gives me the kind of sick feeling I would get from eating an entire box of Twinkies.  I only wish it had been obvious from the beginning that this book is nothing but junk food.

I cannot stand the idiotic trend in film making of this hand held \\"effect\\" of continually moving the camera around, up and down, zoom in-out, shake, shake shake. It's sad to see this tawdry television fad finding its way into big screen movies. This movie is one of the worst!  Too bad,,, I don't even know if the movie otherwise has merit.

B004WJRDN2|4.0|\\"McCartney\\" was a proclamation; I can do this on my own without The Beatles and I'm starting all over again. The problem at the time is that critics missed this and expected \\"Abbey Road\\" Part II from the man who masterminded the suite at the end of side two of the album with John Lennon and George Martin.<br /><br />This deluxe edition allows us to re-evalute McCartney's first \\"offical\\" solo album (he had previously composed the soundtrack for the film \\"The Family Way\\" which was orchestrated by George Martin). It also allows us to re-evaluate it without the history of The Beatles or expectations that come with it. Let's be blunt--\\"McCartney\\" is not a brilliant album nor is it flawless but having said that it has considerable charm among its ramshackle mixture of experimental music, instrumentals and songs. The best songs here \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\", \\"Every Night\\", \\"Oo You\\", \\"Junk\\", \\"Man We Was Lonely\\" hold their own with Paul's best material and, in a sense, are much like Lennon's album \\"Plastic Ono Band\\" (although that album was recorded and released AFTER \\"McCartney\\" in that, if you read between the lines, you can get some insight into the distress that Paul faced at the time; the pressures of The Beatles, the management issues, his continuing conflict with his former bandmates and the redemption of Linda's love which pulled him from an alcholic haze that threatened to engulf and consume him.<br /><br />The remastering of the first disc sounds extremely good--it's a marked improvement over the 1993 remasters and although it isn't quite as subtle as the DCC limited gold edition that Steve Hoffman mastered, it does take advantage of the latest analog to digital converters resulting in a nice sounding remaster that has had some of the clumsy edits and other minor flaws removed. The release done by the same Abbey Road team that did nice work on The Beatles, John Lennon and Apple remasters occasionally has some peak limiting applied to increase the volume on the softer parts of the album but avoids pushing the sound into digital distortion.<br /><br />The second disc features outtakes and some off-the-cuff recordings Paul made at the time as well as live tracks. There isn't much that was left over from the recording sessions for \\"McCartney\\" so this deluxe edition is probably the least enticing in terms of extras but what we do get is quite nice. The second disc features a goofy song Paul created \\"Women Kind\\", an early demo of \\"Suicide\\" (eventually offered to Frank Sinatra who turned it down--this is NOT the Sinatra demo however but the one that we hear a snippet of on the \\"McCartney\\" album), live versions of \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\" from the \\"One Hand Clapping\\" documentary with Wings, \\"Hot as Sun\\" performed live with Wings as well as \\"Don't Cry Baby\\" which eventually became \\"Oo You\\".<br /><br />The DVD features Paul appearing on \\"MTV Unplugged\\" in 1990 when he was promoting \\"Flowers in the Dirt\\", footage of Wings performing in concert in 1979 and a featurette of sorts on the creation of the album. There is, of course, the deluxe booklet filled with personal and professional photos of Paul taken by Linda as well and footage of Paul, Linda their kids playing at the beach around the recording time for the album (and done at the same time that the cover photo was taken for \\"McCartney\\").<br /><br />This is a nice set and although it lacks the extensive extras that will be forthcoming from other sets (and even what was included for \\"McCartney II\\"), it's a nice set for fans avialable in a limited numbered edition.<br /><br />As Paul stepped out from behind the Beatle image with his first solo album allowing him to begin again as an artist it also put him in the crosshairs of critics who expected Paul to create Beatles music when all he was interested in was creating music.but avoids pushing the sound into digital distortion.

B004WJREPO|4.0|\\"McCartney II\\" allowed Paul McCartney to escape the expectations of an ex-Beatle and the pop driven hits of Wings. Like it's counterpart album \\"McCartney\\" the album is homespun even with the technological trappings. The songwriting for the best songs here are appealing and fascinating. Although \\"McCartney II\\" IS flawed (not all the experimental and instrumental tracks work with McCartney sometimes too fascinated with the technology and not still somewhat trapped in the mentality of a songwriter)the best moments take their inspiration from Brian Eno and his experiments at the time. In many respects \\"McCartney II\\" holds its own with Eno's \\"Before and After Science\\" the only album that is comparable. Paul wasn't trying to create a PAUL McCARTNEY album as much as he was trying to defy critical expectations by doing something unusual and experimental in structure.<br /><br />\\"McCartney II\\" unlike its counterpart album comes with plenty of bonus material. Aside from the deluxe, handsomely designed book that houses the CDs and DVD, we get THREE CDs of material. The first has the original album for the first time from the mastertapes (digitally recreated as the original masters were edited between the time they were created and the time they were pressed to vinyl at the demand of Columbia and were drawn from a tape one more generation away from the mastertape). The second has the b-sides, singles issued/recorded around the same time. \\"Blue Sway\\" is drawn from the tapes prepared for \\"Cold Cuts\\" an outtakes album that McCartney had planned for years and almost issued in 1986. It's also the soundtrack to a film on surfing. \\"Secret Friend\\" and other b-sides that were issued at the time are included along with the A-side single for the album the Wings version of \\"Coming Up\\" (it is the single version).<br /><br />The second bonus disc contains the uncut tracks that were prepared when \\"McCartney II\\" was originally planned as a double album and before they were edited for the final album release.<br /><br />The DVD includes the video for \\"Coming Up\\" in its original aspect ratio at the beginning of the Tim Rice Interview (Clarification)however the video itself presented alonge is in widescreen clearly ported over from the tranasfer done for the \\"McCartney Years\\" DVD. We also get the video with Paul's commentary track and an interview to promote the album conducted by lyricist Tim Rice that suggests Rice missed his calling as an interviewer.<br /><br />The remastering by the Abbey Road team that created The Beatles, John Lennon and Apple remasters are quite well done.<br /><br />There are also codes for the lossless version of the album as a digital download as well as a lossy version.<br /><br />This is a terrific set and even if \\"McCartney II\\" is flawed it's an album that fans will enjoy and the real reason to get this are all the extras and the limited edition deluxe book.album release.<br /><br />The DVD includes the video for \\"Coming Up\\" in its original aspect ratio at the beginning of the Tim Rice Interview (Clarification)however the video itself presented alonge is in widescreen clearly ported over from the tranasfer done for the \\"McCartney Years\\" DVD.

I did get this for my daughter to use for her Ipod, thinking it would fit since both products are similar but I was wrong, it doesn't fit. Lucky for me, I do have a iPhone and was able to use it. It works and does what it was made to do.  The price is a little high for a simple and plain case but it fits the purpose.

Prequels are a great way to add zip to a franchise without troubling actors who might have tired of their roles, and the fresh faces for familiar characters add plenty of zip to this one.<br /><br />Still, it's just a summer movie and a comic adaptation at that. You know, cookie-cutter stuff. That can make good cookies, and this makes a good movie, of its ilk. Pop the popcorn, hope for a rainy afternoon, and enjoy!<br /><br />-- wiredweird
0812973992|5.0|Colum McCann's \\"Let the Great World Spin\\" just won the prestigious and lucrative IMPAC Prize, after already winning the National Book Award, and it's hard to imagine a more deserving book. \\"Let the Great World Spin\\" is a novel set at the time of Philippe Petit's real-life tightrope walk between the twin towers of the World Trade Center in August 1974, with the walk itself as its centerpiece. In structure, it is a series of interconnected short stories, with a recurring cast of wildly disparate characters who nevertheless share connections and destinies, sometimes in ways they cannot even guess. Its structure is similar to that of \\"Trainspotting,\\" \\"Three Junes,\\" or \\"The Imperfectionists;\\" if you disliked those books, you probably won't like \\"Let the Great World Spin.\\" But if you did like them, \\"Let the Great World Spin\\" is the best of them all, combining an elegant and varied prose style, superb dialogue, and characters of almost Dickensian vividness.<br /><br />Throughout the novel lies McCann's unspoken but aching question: are our lives controlled by blind fate, by divine providence, or by a combination of forces? McCann never tips his hand as to his own beliefs, and his characters range from the deep, mystical faith of Corrigan, a young Irish monk who ministers to the hookers and low-lifes of the Bronx, to the secular outlook of Gloria, who mourns the son she lost in Vietnam. But McCann leaves readers with an overwhelming sense of our shared humanity, and with the simple, pristine goodness of showing love and concern for each other. He is aided in this goal by his remarkable ability to enter the minds of his protagonists, such as his description of Petit's thoughts as he begins his walk: \\"The core reason for it all was beauty. Walking was a divine delight. Everything was rewritten when he was up in the air. New things were possible with the human form. It went beyond equilibrium. He felt for a moment uncreated. Another kind of awake.\\"

B001HN6918|4.0|I had some trepidation about this one. The first KFP was so much fun, I was afraid they'd just do more of the same, to the point of too much. Instead, I got better than I bargained for.<br /><br />Po remains the overfed semi-slacker of KFP1. He has a reputation, by time this movie starts, and a bit of an ego to go with it. And, as in common cases of acute sequel-itis, #2 is like #1, but lots more. The difference is that this flick really goes beyond the founding member of the franchise. You'll love to hate the evil peacock, and his foundry evokes Geidi Prime, the Orcs' smithy, or any other industrial hell you can think of. Then there's Peng, Po's father. Gawd, I love that silly little goose. He's all about fatherhood, the kind that comes to define a man's entire identity (except for a noodle or two), a role I admire immensely when I see it in real life. And, of course, the quality of recent animation goes up faster than Moore's Law can explain. Except for one teeny, weeny thing, this adds up to a very enjoyable kids' flick, the kind you might not need a kid to enjoy. (Parents of skittish littler ones, check first to see if your tot is up for the more intense scenes.)<br /><br />That one little thing was the flagrant sequel-bait at the end. Grr. A little foreshadowing can be fun. An ambigiuous ending can engage the viewer's imagination. The ending in this one looks almost like a trailer for the next in series. It's almost as if the movie is doing \\"product placement\\" advertising for itself.<br /><br />As you watch it, though, try to forget that the ad is coming. Instead, try to enjoy the spirit that contains equal parts Bruce Lee, Mr. Rogers, and Three Stooges. Right down to that big fight scene near the end, there's a lot to enjoy.<br /><br />-- wiredweird, reviewing the release to theaters
B004UC1WN8|4.0|This is Lopez's best album since her \\"J Lo\\" album. While it may not be the most original with the greatest vocals, Lopez offers a solid dance album. I had been disappointed with her previous albums since J Lo, and I'm happy she was able to make a current album 10 years after the J Lo album. There are many good tracks on this album, even some of the slower-tempo ones. Lopez does lose some of her latin vibe on here, as she seems to focus on club-ready songs.
B0041T52S6|5.0|This movie failed in the theaters, which sucks, because I went to see it about a month after it came out, and I thought it was just as good if not better than, the American Manga series it was based on. They did have to put the whole story in one movie, which means there was a lot of 2 things, those being altering and editing. However, I can safely say that the core of the humor, action, and heart, still remain intact and identifiable, and all changes to the story do not make it any less of a hyperactive fun ride than the Manga. I can also say that the viewing of this film, will not detract from your enjoyment of the Manga series, in any way. So, if you liked the Manga, or this movie, pick it up! Also the bonus features are pretty weird, but still great.

I've never been a fan of the high tech shoes and this gave me some insight into why. The book was well written and I found myself wanting to go for a run!

B004K4AUZW|4.0|This is a solid effort by Lady Gaga to put forward an extensive and thorough new album. Overall, it is very creative, and there is a heavy 80s influence in this album that is still current and different. Most of the album has an up-beat tempo except for a few tracks in the middle. Now that I've listened to it many times, I will skip over a few tracks usually - but I prefer this in a 17-track album instead of an 8-track album. There is a good variety and the album showcases her talent, ambition and thorough work as an artist. This is a must-buy for music fans!
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|This is the first album the Foo Fighters have released this decade and, in my opinion, it stands equal to their most all time classic 1997's \\"The Colour And The Shape\\". That's saying a lot, trust me, but it's the truth, speaking as a longtime fan. There are no bad songs on here, or even just good, all of them are great, or even excellent. This proves that Rock music is going to be totally amazing this decade and if not, then at least the Foo Fighters will be. To finish this, I would like to state a fact: this album was entirely recorded in Dave Grohl's garage!
034552554X|3.0|There is quite a lot to like in this book, which starts out with great energy and imagination but falters just over halfway through. The use of flowers as a means of communication works well to bring the reader into Victoria's tale. And while the heroine's background provides a solid basis for sympathy, unfortunately the story moves into a mystical/fantastic realm (in terms of the effects of Victoria's floral creations on her customers) that serves to reduce both the impact and the seriousness of the primary subject matter--which is, in no small regard, both the long-term often negative effect of the foster care system and the terrible loss of trust that is a major factor in the life of so many children lacking parents. Particularly well-done is the section dealing with Victoria's introduction to motherhood, especially the nursing section. Author Diffenbaugh really nails the frantic desperation bordering on madness of a new mother of tender years. For me this is the truest section of the book. Bits and pieces before and after have moments of authenticity but as a whole the narrative doesn't entirely ring true. Because the author sets herself such a stringent standard in creating her heroine as a foundling (with the many huge emotional issues that come along with that scenario), it's hard to buy so many secondary characters endowed with fairly superhuman powers of understanding and forgiveness who tolerate Victoria's behavior. I will be interested to see what the author does next. But sadly, for me, this book has too many fairy tale aspects to be taken as seriously as the subject matter dictates.
B0034G4ORM|4.0|This movie has very good special effects, lots and lots of big explosions, and characters that don't feel too real, but at least they are tolerable to listen to.  Not much in the way of whining or that one dude in every movie that you \\"want to die\\".  You basically have to check your brain at the door, and just enjoy the ride.  I think too many people expect a masterpiece of thespian acting and a bulletproof script every time they watch a movie, which really will ruin a movie like this.    Side note :  The editorial review for this movie on Amazon made me seriously laugh.  Check it out for yourself if you think it MIGHT be a little misleading!
B004YSDT52|4.0|Some people complaint that the plot is straightforward and not enough twists.

Then, they start to lie and do more crimes due to self preservation. Don't watch this movie if you have this kind of guilt; otherwise, you will know what I am talking about. Compared to Nolan's other movies, this one is probably closer to Dark Knight rather than Memento in terms of the spirit.
0470477237|5.0|This is a terrific book. While many media professionals may find that its content is old history, and others might dislike the absence of hard data to justify many of the arguments presented throughout the text, I found Qualman's treatment of the subject inspiring. As he says, \\"the world as it was, no longer is\\". Social media has transformed our society and the way we do business, teach, and interact with others. The author describes various tools, from blogs to twitter to wikipedia, google, and search engine optimization to name but a few, that warrant study by anyone interested in incorporating social media into their personal or professional lives. The book is read easily, and by avoiding jargon or complex sentence structure is easily understandable. It does not need to be read cover to cover, and can be perused for material, including quick glances at key points sections placed at the end of each chapter. Among other things, the author adresses themes such as how Social Media has become the new \\"Inbox\\", and how Social Media increases efficiency by eliminating multiple individual redundancies. While he points out the benefits of Social Media in business, I wondered about applications in my own profession, and immediately began thinking about how Social Media will continue to transform the way medical education is provided, furthering movements in this field towards democratization of knowledge and patient empowerment. In his summary, Qualman writes that the winners in the new Socialnomic world are customers and those companies that create the best products, but the reality, in my modest opinion, is that Social Media also provides an opportunity for empowerment through education and communication for all members of society, including the underserved, in a potentially very cost-effective way. By enlightening those not yet aware of the power of Social Media, and providing food for thought to those aready acquainted with this evolution in societal behavior, Eric Qualman provides us with a valuable resource, that, in my opinion, will remain relevant for several years to come.
B004SBQAL0|4.0|I am Number Four struck me as a great little bit of a movie that seemed all the more familiar, especially when I watched it for the second time. Turns out, the producers of the film were the same ones who brought us Smallvlle seasons 1-8. So if you're a Smallville fan, you'll probably love this flick.<br /><br />There are a few cons. When viewed on anything other than an HDTV with BR player, the film is so darkly unlit as to make it aggravating to watch. The special features are not very heroic; there's a featurette of the actress playing Number 6. That's about it for the DVD. The BR does has quite a bit more, but given the weight of the project - a hopeful launching of a film franchise in and of itself - this movies extra features are pretty skimpy.<br /><br />The movie is fun, and the special effects are awesome if you are watching in HDTV and BR. I watched it a couple of times back-to-back, trying to notice details I missed before. There are two quotes that seriously make the movie worth watching by themselves. Something about XBox and another on Red Bull..... It's a decent enough movie that I am going to start reading the novels. Take that how you will.

B0052UZIFA|3.0|One of the best time burners ever! Problem is: the graphics are some what crap. Low resolution sprites and sorta off aspect ratio along with sllllooooooowwwww victory animation drag this game down a bit. If fixed, the game would be nigh perfect.
B003EYVXUU|5.0|Let me In is an American film based of the Swedish novel, Let the Right One In, which was already produced as a motion picture. The story features two very lonely children who form a special bond over the span of about two weeks; it actually seems like love at first sight, or as close to it has the children are capable. The whole plot revolves around the protagonist Abby - a vampire - and her willingness to allow another to see her as she is. It takes time, but eventually Owen, her meek neighbor, finds himself friends with a blood-sucker.<br /><br />The movie is slow. I think it serves to add a bit more tension and creepiness. Of course, this may set off some viewers. There is very little CGI and the special effects are used to show the story, not to shine a light on the gore The acting is beautiful and haunting, and you can quickly see how the film may end. The cinematography is breathtaking, with the best use of dull color light and empty space to push the loneliness that much further. Predictability aside, I come away from watching the film seeing how two very different people can find trust and love, despite their difference.<br /><br />Do take note of the R rating. The movie puts the spotlight on the 12 year old actors, but this is not a kid's film. For every bit of violence that occurs off-camera there is a bloody scene to follow it up. The film also deals with Owen being abused horribly by fellow students.<br /><br />By far, this is my favorite vampire movie since the Lugosi original.

I did talk to customer service at Amazon and they know they have a problem with the PAL discs being offered with NTSC discs they need to separate the two    The concert is fabulous, even better than Live at Valhall which is also a very good one to own.

This is also a Warner Brothers remastered release, making sound quality all-around cleaner. I took the vinyl out for the first time and was shocked at how heavy it was.

1401310400|5.0|First off, I had very low expectations on the book, only bought it cause it was cheap and needed some reading for summer trips.  I LOVED it.  It was light reading which is exactly what I wanted and exaclty what I expected \\"Richard Castle\\" to write.  Being a HUGE fan of Castle the TV Show, and esp Nathan Fillion, I wanted to see what the books would be like. The book is really an extension of the TV Show, because you can make out parts he has in the books that were in the first 2 season's of the show (Castle is following Beckett around to do research-so you would expect that because what he is seeing in the field is going to be in his book right?)  Whoever ABC is getting to write these books did a really great job.  Also, what a novel idea for promotion of a TV show.  These books and the Richard Castle Website, Ingenious--hats off to the producers and creator of the TV Show.  I bought Naked Heat also and finished both books on a cross coutry car trip!
B00475AYJQ|3.0|I could not put down the The Name of the Wind. Rothfuss is lyrical and engrossing in his writing and style.  The words, rhythm and timing of the story with all its various twists and turns are nothing short of magical...until you get to the last chapter.  It's simply ran out of steam, like a child prodigy who got bored with his brilliance and finished up in a rush. But, have no fear, I said to myself...there is Day 2, which will clear up all the confusion left in Day 1.  Nope! Day 2 has much of the magic as Day 1, if not much more so, but it leaves the reader with nothing more than a chance to grasp at disappointment. The writing in Day 2 is terrific.  And the various events that Kvothe goes through are fantastic and brilliant.  Yet, that is simply not enough.  Also, at times, it feels like the story was written with different hands. Instead of smooth and well-connected transitions between wonderfully written scenes and fantastic events, the story meanders up and down and around with no direction or focus. Just one fascinating but unfulfilling moment after the next. That in and of itself is an art form, but it did NOT work for me. And it's incredibly frustrating because Rothfuss is a gifted writer beyond compare. For that, Rothfuss should be applauded. The artistry stands out in a huge way, but I cannot help but believe he got bored. If you want a gratifying read, this is not the book. It will leave you wanting. At times, the story will carry on with such wonderful detail and scope, and such a great story line, that one is completely enthralled.  Then the story will just tail off in some awkward fashion leading to another chapter of events, with fuzzy dialogue and a complete lack of synergy.  Often, I was ready to put the book down and not return. But I didn't. Like Day 1, I could not put down Day 2 but for different reasons.  I was waiting for Day 2 to tie a bunch of loose ends from Day 1. That never happened. Instead, Rothfuss simply created more loose ends and decided (yes, no doubt this was intentional) to leave the reader quite disappointed. Frankly, I found it frustrating and annoying. So much so, that I may not buy Day 3 if there is one unless and until I read reviews that tell me Day 3 answers the questions in Day 1 and Day 2, and the reviews are stellar. Frankly, I doubt that will be the case.
B004ZQRJFO|3.0|You have two of the most talented emcees in the game together on one cd.  Both have the power and $$ to hire any producer.  What happened?  what is with the girl singing hooks?  Just like Dr Dre's new single for detox.....this album had so much promise.  Why did they make so many songs with R&B singy hooks?  Something tells me Dre's CD will fail like this.  ROyce da 5-9 is toooo talented and eminem is too dope for this.  The lyrics are here but the album is a big fail due to the hooks and eminem trying to sing the hooks as well. I am glad they got back together but no excuse for this turd.
B004NIFSRA|5.0|As the description reads, IT'S 200 BLANK PAGES.  So, if you don't want it to fill your Kindle with useless pages, don't download it.  If you think buying the paper version is too expensive considering it's 200 BLANK PAGES, don't buy it.  I for one, downloaded it to my Kindle for free.  I let a few people 'read' it, and they all saw the humour in it.  So for that, I give it a 5 star rating.  Free helps and gets a star.  Seeing my friends and family smile when they get the joke, gets the other 4 stars.  Reading all the ridiculous negative comments when the description of this book is 100% accurate, is priceless.

This book is a fast and intriguing read and even after the second chapter, I created a master checklist for my life that I continue to use daily for nearly a year now. A checklist is so simple yet a powerful means to affect a change in behavior; it prevents you from easily ignoring what you value most. I highly recommend this book.
B0050XFY4O|5.0|The messages from the soul unfolds quietly as the movie travels throughout the  growth of the two brothers. Painfully sad in a few places,but love and passion expressed leaving the viewer with a sense that true and unconditional love can and does exist often from the places no one would expect.  For me the film was great. At some points in each of our lives there are a few very special people that come into our lives changing it forever. This love may last as a brief moment in time, or may be the one true love that last for a lifetime.     I give \\"From Beginning to End\\" a five star rating.  You have to expierence a love so deep, so strong and powerful as was shared here to somewhat understand and appreciate these passions from the heart.
B002ZG98UA|1.0|gawd where to start?!?! sucks is too good. mediocrity for the masses. this movie and its glowing reviews merely further illustrate how hollywood is bankrupt of originallity and the public in general are lemmings. sure the effects are slick but i just kept wishing they would kill a main character just to break the monotany/predictabillity! no such luck they arent gonna jeopardize their franchise til sales start to wane. if i had paid to see this attrocity i would REALLY be venomous!!! as it is i feel that i have still been raped intellectually and by the loss of life spent watching this garbage. the story is unoriginal in any way shape or form and perhaps more unforgivable unentertaining unless effects and shiny things are enough to please you. as for myself most definitely not. as for the further adventures of resident evil the movies i will be sure NOT to see them! miss them? not hardly i can ALWAYS find something more entertaining and/or intellectually stimulating than this $h!t like waxing my pubes which is a far better alternative! avoid like the plague!!!

My chance came when Hilary Hahn performed it at Verizon Hall with the Curtis Symphony Orchestra.  After hearing the piece, I knew I needed to hear it again so I bought the CD.  Now I listen to it repeatedly and each time is a different experience because there are so many aspects to it. A plus on the CD is the sweet Tchaikovsky Yiolin Concerto which is a great pleasure to listen to.

B004A8ZX2S|5.0|A film that opens with a family dealing with a death. The story of the family is then told, as a couple falls in love, marries and has children. The father raises his boys in a very strict manner, at times engendering resentment, particularly with his oldest. The story is bookended with sequences representing the beginning and end of life. The film concludes with the mother giving one of her sons to god, after his death at 19. This movie is very realistically told, with the setting of the late 50's and early 60's convincingly used, and the everyday love and conflict within the family unit present throughout the film. Sean Penn is featured briefly in the beginning and the end, and is remembering the upbringing of him and his now dead brother. A well told story that engages the viewer, and with a little patience, is definitely worth the time invested.
044654146X|5.0|At the outset it must be said that the title of the book is a bit misleading. This book is not about Israel's economy, nor is it really about Israel's high technology industry. In my opinion, this book is more about the Israeli mentality and culture.     In this book, Dan Senor and Saul Singer explore the reasons behind the Israeli creativity, which has manifested itself in various achievements in various fields. Without getting into too much detail, Dan Senor and Saul Singer boiled down the reasons for Israel's creativity to a few factors:    1. \\"Chutzpah\\" (audacity)- the lack of respect for authority and the \\"Chutzpah\\" to make your voice heard when you think you're right. In other words, the attitude of \\"I know how to it better than anyone else even if I just graduated and my boss has a Ph.D. and he's 20 years older than I am\\", or the fact that a young solider has no problem to tell his commander that he's doing it all wrong.    2. The Army- almost every Israeli, when s/he reaches the age of eighteen, joins the army. Dan Senor and Saul Singer argue that the amount of responsibility that these young people face is incredible and it helps these young people face the real world once they get released from the army. Another quality that the authors contribute to the army service is the fact that a lot of combat soldiers (but not only) develop the skill of improvisation (an important skill for every combat solider), which is also nurtured, to some degree, by the top generals.    3. Immigration- in short, the constant arrival of immigrants to Israel, who are highly motivated to succeeis always good for the economy, especially when these people are highly educated such as the Russian Jews.      4. The culture acceptance of failure, and therefore, people are not afraid of starting new businesses due to the fear of failing.      There are a few more factors, but these are the important ones. By reading this book you will get valuable insights into the Israeli culture and mentality. It will enrich your knowledge about Israel in general.  Highly recommended.
0553274503|5.0|It was in 1969 when my secretary gave me this book and told me I would enjoy it. \\"Flowers for Algernon\\" grabbed me from the first page. I'm not a fast reader, and I'll take breaks now and again.  But this was the very first book I started and did not stop until I finished.  I think it was so cleverly written, so absorbing.

B000P0J0EW|5.0|For once, the IMDB top 250 is pretty close to the truth! I am perfectly dismayed to see in Top 10 such perfectly mediocre movies, to say the least, like ''Pulp Fiction'' or ''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'', but ''The Shawshank Redemption'' and ''The Godfather (Part 1)'' sharing the first place is one of the exceptions when popular taste seems to go hand in hand with great and profound art.    ''The Shawshank Redemption'', indeed, is one of those movies which are extremely close to perfection; perhaps the indifferent soundtrack is the only weak point but this is of no consequence. The movie has a terrific screenplay, to begin with. Hardly is there a scene that is less than memorable, and most are unforgettable, and the dialogue is superb throughout, combining light humour with unobtrusive but far from negligible philosophical depth. I was amazed to learn that the scene with Mozart's music is not in Stephen King's original, and indeed he didn't like it. I have always thought of this scene as one of the most moving in the movie, together with the harrowing lives of those who come out after 40 or 50 years of imprisonment. It really is damn true that everything in life boils down to this ultimate question: ''Get busy living, or get busy dying?'' In addition to all that, Frank Darabont's direction is masterful. I honestly envy everybody who watches this movie for a first time without knowing any details of the story; he will be able to appreciate Darabont's genius for directing which is apt to be overlooked after numerous viewings. To take but one example: the discovery of Andy's escape and the explanation of it, with the retrospect shots, the consequences and Red's narrative, is well-nigh perfectly executed scene.    Having mentioned Andy and Red, need I add that the cast is outstanding? Too bad that Tim Robbins never attained a more prominent place in the Hollywood hall of fame, for he is a fine actor of considerable talent, but Morgan Freeman did. And it is he who delivers many of the most haunting lines here, such as his great (and so true!) speech about the definition of ''institutionalized'' culminating in ''They send you here for life, and that's exactly what they take. The part that counts, anyway.'' Few actors have the ability of Morgan Freeman to make the best of their lines without in the least exaggerating. The supporting cast is equally perfect. Bob Gunton as the warden and Clancy Brown as the chief guard, both of them profoundly sadistic and with rather perverse ideas of gratitude (though I confess I enjoyed Hadley's ''thanks''), are fantastic and so are some of the inmates such as William Sadler as the greatest fan of Hank Williams, Mark Rolston as one of the Sisters who are not homosexual because ''one must be human first and they don't qualify'' (Red) and especially James Whitmore as the old Brooks, probably the most heart-rending character in the movie.       There really is no need of wasting words. ''The Shawshank Redemption'' remains one of the most powerful tributes to human spirit ever made for the screen. Everybody MUST see this gem at least once. It is an incredibly inspiring movie, a movie that gives me hope (yes, the best of things!) in human nature like few other works of art, let alone personal experiences, do. Like another equally shattering masterpiece (''One Flew over Cuckoo's Nest''), it reminds us, the free men who rather presumptuously calls ourselves ''normal'', that prisons and lunatic asylums are full, not so much with monsters of depravity, but mostly with ordinary people like you and me who just did one stupid thing more or for whom the pressure of society turned out to be too much; to say nothing of the ridiculously inept prison system rife with callousness and cruelty that range from terror behind the bars to starving outside of them. What better way to finish than one memorable quote from Red's ''institutionalized speech'':    ''These walls are funny. First you hate 'em, then you get usedto 'em. Enough time passes, you get so you depend on them. That's institutionalized.''
B00005JNBQ|4.0|This is a movie I can say is certainly among,if not THE,most quirkiest movie I have ever seen/reviewed.Released in January/04,it stars Jon Heder as the nerd supreme.His world is populated by stereotypical characters of the extreme;the downtrodden and we-don't-fit-in types to the \\"popular\\" people and bullies.The plot,which if turned sideways would disappear,is as quirky as the characters that populate it.<br />The story takes place in rural Preston,Idaho in the early 90s,but the Dynamite family,house and decor suggest a definite 70s kiche.Napolean and brother Kip(Aaron Ruell)live with their grandmother(Sandy Martin),ho is most definitely butch in nature.One day their granny tells the boys she is going out on a date but ends up in the hospital for a spell after injuring herself while riding an ATV over a particularly large desert dune.Coming to the baby sitting rescue is their uncle Rico(John Gries)who has the old should've,could've-longing from his high school days.As Napoleon plods along at school Kip,who sits in front of a computer screen all day,is persuaded to forgo his internet chatting/surfing long enough to help his uncle make a little bread.<br />Meanwhile at school Napolean has befriended a Mexican student by the name of Pedro(Efren Ramirez).The first big challenge to them comes picking and getting someone to take to the prom.The next one is Pedro`s desire to become student president.Pedro ends up taking a girl that Napolean kind of had his eye on to the dance and in the end Pedro actually wins the presidency.<br />As the movie comes to a close Grandma has returned,Kip has met someone from his chat room who is his ``soul mate`` and that girl Napolean likes,Deb(Tina Majorino),meets up with Nappy to play tether ball.In a post credit sequence Kip and his ``soul mate`` Lafawnduh(Shondrella Avery)get married and a lateto the wedding Napolean rides up on a ``just tamed`` wild horse,which he presents to the bride and groom who ride off as Napolean is heard to utter,``lucky``.<br />As I said there is just enough of a ``plot`` to give the characters here impetus to go from one situation to another and that is it.But since everyone is soooo quirky you pay not so much attention to where it is going as to enjoying the ride itself.Napolean is the star character and he seems to be an 11 year old wrapped up in a teenager`s body.His eyes rarely make contact with anyone,he says ``flippin` `` alot and when frustrated he makes a deep guttural sigh.His run is like the loping gait of the creatures from the original``Invaders from Mars``,just hilarious;another quirky character trait among many,that endears this character(and movie)to the viewer.This movie made for a paltry $400,000 made over $46,000,000!! Astounding.<br />This film is presented in BOTH widescreen(1:85:1) and fullscreen versions,which means they have put it on a dreaded two sided disc.There are special features like a making of featurette,an extended video of the wedding,a short film ``Pelica``,deleted scenes,commentary and stills gallery.The transfer is well done and is clear and crisp.<br />All in all a winner of a film.A more weird and quirky film you will be hard pressed to find but it works wonderfully on many levels.Don`t anaylze it too much,just hang on and enjoy the flippin`ride.Recommended.As I said there is just enough of a ``plot`` to give the characters here impetus to go from one situation to another and that is it.But since everyone is soooo quirky you pay not so much attention to where it is going as to enjoying the ride itself.Napolean is the star character and he seems to be an 11 year old wrapped up in a teenager`s body.His eyes rarely make contact with anyone,he says ``flippin` `` alot and when frustrated he makes a deep guttural sigh.His run is like the loping gait of the creatures from the original``Invaders from Mars``,just hilarious;another quirky character trait among many,that endears this character(and movie)to the viewer.This movie made for a paltry $400,000 made over $46,000,000!!

0312360258|3.0|Imagine a world where monsters are an accepted reality. Imagine, too, that in this world, children undergo an alarming change. No longer are they the sweet-tempered cherubs you have come to treasure, but dark, brooding creatures that wreak havoc in the lives of others and have the habit of sleeping during the day. What are they? No, not teenagers (though you're not far from the mark if that was your guess): vampires. Welcome to the world of Zoey Redbird, a place not so different from our own: bullies pick on nerds, parents and children fail to understand each other, and the high school \\"in\\" crowd takes particular joy in excluding outsiders from social activities. The only notable difference is that the word \\"vampires\\" is spelled with a \\"y,\\" and teenagers have the nasty habit of turning into these bloodsucking creatures without warning. This \\"Change,\\" occurring only during adolescence, is caused by a confusing mix of mutant DNA and hormones.  When Zoey comes down with a particularly bad case of it, her horrified family and friends turn on her. She takes refuge at the House of Night, an exclusive boarding school for vampyres, where she makes a friends, enemies, and a name for herself. Unfortunately, her story isn't a very remarkable one. It borrows elements from a number of successful fantasy sagas, and more or less reads like an American Harry Potter: lonely, friendless protagonist discovers that s/he has magical powers and gets to attend a school for magic where students wear elaborately designed school uniforms. To the protagonist's surprise, s/he turns out to have an outstanding talent for magic, despite the fact that s/he has had no formal training. In addition, the protagonist acquires, upon immediate arrival, an arrogant, blond-haired nemesis with inappropriate levels of hostility towards non-magic users. To top this all off, Zoey has a \\"mark\\" on her forehead, a crescent moon-shaped tattoo indicative of the Change. So: is this just another exercise in teenage wish-fulfillment? You bet. But like the countless other offerings in the YA vampire romance genre, it serves as a sufficient mode of escapism. Why else should we read, if not to escape reality?

You bet. But like the countless other offerings in the YA vampire romance genre, it serves as a sufficient mode of escapism. Why else should we read, if not to escape reality?

B0050PYNO4|4.0|I'm sure you already know the basic outline of the movie...    This is a consistently funny movie with a lot of heart, though not quite as good as either Shaun or Hot Fuzz. This is mainly because even though they spend a long time developing the main characters of Graham, Clive and Paul, the secondary characters, like the FBI agents, the Hillbillies and Ruth's Dad often come across as one dimensional stereotypes. This isn't to say they aren't funny, just that if they had spent more time fleshing out these characters then the movie would have felt more fully rounded out and would have been up there with their best. While I don't normally like Seth Rogan, he does bring a lot of foul-mouthed charm to the role, and talking of Paul, the CG of him is stellar. Yes, they are other CG characters in other movies done just as well as Paul, but they aren't on screen nearly as long as Paul is. He never looks or feels like he isn't a fully realized character. Kristen Wiig has a lot of fun with her role as the uptight christian who has her horizons expanded, but her role too felt like it needed to be written with a bit more depth to it. Props, however go to Jane Lynch who totally nails her two appearances in the movie.     For anyone vaguely aware of the movies of Spielberg/Lucas and sci-fi movies/tv in general, there are lots of little fun references and in jokes peppered throughout the movie for you to notice and enjoy.     As far as the blu ray goes, (this is based on the region free UK blu ray) the image quality is right up there with the best of them. It comes with both the theatrical release and the unrated cut, which adds 5 mins to the length of the movie but doesn't really add that much more. I only noticed two scenes where they were extended. The commentary track between Pegg, Frost, Hader and Mottola is almost as funny as the movie. Pegg and Frost, in particular, need nothing more than to be set in front of a microphone and their energetic humor just pours out. There isalso about an hours worth of stuff on the making of the movie and another 40 mins worth on the creation of the Paul character. Plus there is a bunch of other stuff to enjoy as well.    As far as packaging goes, it is a shame that, out here in the States, we aren't getting the Limited Edition Steelbook case that they released in the UK. It is really, really nice, See for yourself.  [...]  They released a similar style Steelbook case out here for the Extended Edition of Dune, and very nice it was too.    Let me end by saying I watched Paul with a broad smile on my face throughout the whole movie and I enjoyed it a lot more than I did with (their normal director) Edgar Wright's effort, Scott Pilgrim... which was all style and no substance. This is definitely the kind of movie that you invite a bunch of your geeky friends over and enjoy the hell out of it.

B0052UZIFA|1.0|Many people playing this game have played it on another platform, as was with me. I was expecting something new and different on the Android platform (especially with the gargantuan wait time for it to be released for Android), but instead we get a lazy port of an iPhone app that barely runs, even on high-end phones, and doesn't even multitasking.<br /><br />This is not even taking into consideration that you WILL eventually lose your progress and have to start all over.  For me, this happened near the end of the third level. Since I have played this before, I am not going to go through the first levels again.  Pretty sad, because every time I think about playing it, I decide not to because of this.<br /><br />What makes this even worse is that I didn't get this for free... I actually paid for it because I've been a fan for a while now.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|Firefly is a great series and one that I can watch many times over and not be bored with it. It combines science fiction with an \\"Old West\\" feel, has great chemistry between the characters, combines humor with drama and action, and shows the main characters/\\"good guys\\" in a very human and flawed way, which makes it more relateable, without being cheesy in the least. This series ended far too soon, which as any sci-fi fan knows is something Fox has a tendency to do. It is a timeless show and well worth watching. My only issue with buying the DVD set is how expensive it is! That's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. The show itself is 5 stars, but the price, no matter where you look, doesn't justify 5 stars. And yes, price is pertinent to a review since the review is about the DVD set and not just the show itself. It's almost highway robbery, but it's such a good show that I finally broke down and bought it. I watch a lot of science fiction and fantasy, and this is definitely one of my favorites. It's Joss Whedon at his best!
0307887960|5.0|Anyone that is writing a review should actually try the diet! This diet is amazing! I have weighed between 120-130 my whole life without exercising and never dieting. I should mention that I am 5'2\\". I reached menopause and started to gain weight rapidly and started tipping the scale at 151! I tried the Atkins diet and was able to get down to about 145 but weight loss was slow and I reached a plateau. I went 2 months on the strictest phase of the Atkins without any weighloss. I was also walking over 3 miles 4 days a week. I was really scared and couldn't stand to see my round face in the mirror.   I saw the Dr. Oz show and they had the Dukan Diet reviewed on his show and then I saw it on the cover of Woman's World at the grocery store. I figured I had to give it a shot and bought the copy. I prepared everything and didn't cheat at all for the first 3 weeks. Weight loss was rapid and I haven't ever hit a plateau....unless I cheat. I have cheated once for 4 days, and then a few times I was tempted with pizza for dinner.  It has now been 6 weeks and I have lost a total of 22 pounds! The weight just keeps on coming off; it is totally amazing. Soon I will be as thin as when I was in high school. Oh, and I didn't mention that when I started the Dukan Diet, I was NOT walking anymore. I actually quit exercising to put this diet to the real test.   Dr. Dukan said that this diet will work when other diets fail. I didn't believe it, but now I do. It is the Atkins diet on steroids! 22 pounds lighter and from a size 10 to a size 4! I feel great and now know that I am in control of weightloss and can easily do it whenever I want. I have my life and my body back!
B002ZG981E|4.0|This is a great movie, but honestly I found it a little too long. I love the concept, and many of the scenes in it make it worth purchasing it on Blu-ray instead of DVD, at least in my opinion. The casting is great, especially Leonardo DiCaprio, Ken Watanabe, and Michael Caine. I can't complain about any of the actors either. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, and the rest do a great job as well, I just think DiCaprio, Watanabe, and Caine are exceptionally profound actors in any movie. Overall, this is a fun movie to watch, especially if you have surround sound and a large, widescreen, HD TV, but some of the scenes are just a pinch on the boring/dragged out side.
B0009FTXGI|3.0|Purchased this lens hood for a Canon EF-S 10-22 mm lens since it was considerably cheaper that the Canon brand hood. The appearance is fine and the plastic material is comparable to the branded product. The fit, however, isn't as good as I had expected. It is very tight and it has to be forced onto the lens. Overall, it's likely fine for what it's used for though.
B003UESJHE|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I don't want to hype it up too much because too much hype can ruin an amazing movie for some people. But I have to say, this movie is truly that great. The cinematography, casting, script, and everything else about this movie comes together in a perfect way.    You couldn't ask for a better cast. Their acting is superb, and the way they all fit their characters and interact with each other is seamless. The script is well written and every bit of it has a purpose in the story. It is inspiring, powerful, emotional, and so much more!    Now for the cinematography. I never thought a drama could have this kind of cinematography. It seems like action movies and sci-fi/fantasy movies get most of the nods in that category. Don't get me wrong, those genres can be amazing in the field (namely in The Lord of the Rings movies), but I would not expect this level of cinematography from a drama/period piece. A few of the film shots were some of the best I have ever seen in any movie.    One of my concerns about this movie before seeing it was that it might be boring. It wasn't at all! I suppose some people might find it boring, and that is fine. It just might not be their cup of tea. But I found it to be very engaging. Colin Firth does such an amazing job as the lead. When he would struggle to speak, I could physically feel his anguish. His acting was so brilliant that even if he were the only good thing about the movie, it would still be worth watching. Fortunately, he is not the only good thing about it. Everything about it is good!    I highly recommend watching this movie if you even remotely enjoy this genre. If you're on the fence, hop over to the side of watching it!
1594744769|5.0|Wow! What an interesting and unexplored original concept. In addition to this books strange alluring cover, I found myself falling in love with this book on the first page.<br /><br />Ransom Riggs is an exceptional new talent. His descriptions are intricate, and the addition of the vintage photographs makes this story transcend fiction and blurs the lines of what we know to be real. I loved the combination of historical and present settings. The characters sprang to life for me, to a point where I found myself thinking of their dilemma's even when my nose wasn't in this book. There isn't too much I can really say about the plot without giving it away, but I will say I enjoyed his reasons for why some things are the way they are and how some things came to be. If you enjoy fantasy, history, and a well written, unique and engrossing novel, \\"Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children\\" is a fantastic one to fall into. I will certainly be on the lookout for Ransom Rigg's future works!

B0032UYFA6|5.0|I very much enjoyed Seasons 1 and 2 of Breaking Bad, but Season 3 was even better than expected. A lot more effort is put into character development, especially the relationship between Jesse and Walt (with a couple of very unexpected plot twists). The writing is more refined and exacting than in the first two seasons, making for a somewhat slower pace at times, but more depth to the storyline and characters.<br /><br />As usual, Bryan Cranston puts in a stellar performance, and is backed by an excellent cast. One of the few shows where there are no weak links in the cast.<br /><br />Highly recommend. Season 4 can't get here quick enough!
0307594009|4.0|I am going to jump right in.This book is funny,eloquent, and  wise.Anne is such a thinker-she could practically be a Greek philosopher.She ponders over things that most of us don't think about until our teeth are falling out and we already have one foot in the grave.What makes everything even more sad is that the amazing gift to write,to pour out her emotions on a blank piece of paper,that Anne posesses, is a gift endowed to very few people.She had this gift.If Anne had lived,even if only for a couple of years after the war, what she could have given to the world is painful to think about.Her life after her capture was snuffed out like a flame in a candle.Anne's wish to be remembered after her death has been fulfilled.She lives on in this diary.<br /><br />Now,look at the title of this review.I still hold this view-not only was Anne,how do I say this, very wise for her age(towards the end of the book,st least)she knows MUCH more than other fifteen year olds,things that she discusses fluidly and easily.I mistakenly picked up this book thinking it to be the sweet,innocent thoughts of a little girl living in World War II.Boy,was I wrong.Anne is most certainly NOT innocent,with her vivid thoughts and flair, and in her understanding of the war and humanity.<br /><br />( A 12 year old's review)

0440238609|5.0|I am an adult who loves fantasy novels.  His Dark Materials are definitely dark, absorbing, incredibly creative, exciting, very well-written, refreshingly unsentimental...  I can go on and on.  I would recommend these books to mature kids 13 and up.  Not for little ones... and not because of the religious context (most of which they wouldn't understand anyway), but because of the extreme amount of violence.  And I have to say that it is a shame that there are narrow-minded people in this world who refuse to like these books based on the fact that the author is an atheist and dares put his beliefs in his own books.  Never mind the fact that fantasy favorites C.S. Lewis and Madeleine L'Engle (my personal favorite) imbued their christian beliefs into their writing.  I don't judge them for that.  I am not a christian, but I love their books because they're excellent.  There is no danger of me being converted to christianity from reading their books than a christian becoming an atheist from reading His Dark Materials.  They're FANTASY books, not non-fiction.

6305907145|3.0|I just finished watching the movie Mansfield Park which debuted in 1999 and was directed by Patricia Rozema, and I am seeing for the first time; and it struck me for a couple of reasons, with some of the scenes sending my mind spinning. Although my review here is from a very narrow prism, I think it valid all the same and I am not willing to give it a pass. You may ask yourself how I can be so narrow, well, I do not look at movies just be to fun-entertained, I am very concerned with the message and construction of the story being told. For this review my focus is only going to deal with the issue of slavery and how it has been sanitized and trivialized in this movie.     Set in 1806 England, and although, one never actually see's any slaves, or a black person at all for that matter; they are the very foundation of the Bertram family's wealth. A family that is rich enough so that they can afford to take in a very poor 10 year old relation. Which brings me to the start of the movie and the first mention of slaves, as the coach is carrying the 10 year old girl Fanny Price to her rich relative's mansion.  They pass along a coast where a ship is anchored and the coachman stops to tend to the horses and Fanny leans out the window and asks, \\"Do you hear that? It was the sound of wailing, the coachman explains to her that it was coming from the anchored ship in which slaves were confined. It struck me that the scene seemed to touch on a serious topic in a fairly casual manner. My immediate thought was, is this the new way the subject of slavery is going to be dealt with in films now?     Then further along in this story, we come to find out how much the business of slaveholding and dealing in Antigua has aided and given this family respectability and standing in English society. The daughters and sons have all been given the best education; they are full of all the right social graces and good and witty converse. They have been introduced to polite society at the right moment, and have every expectation to aspire to the best financial matches for their future matrimonies, which will increase their fortunes, all thanks to the poor slaves being held in Antigua.      The next mention of the slaves in Antigua is when the Patriarch has to travel to Antigua to go over his holdings. Upon his return from Antigua there is a scene where the family is in the sitting room, and the Patriarch is talking about the physical attributes of the slaves he holds and how there is a girl he plans on bringing to England to work in the house, and Fanny Price mentions that she has read that if you bring a slave to England they would have to be granted freedom. Then, the Patriarch makes an ignorant comment about how two mulattoes could not have offspring, to which statement one of his son's who is studying to become a clergyman objects.     The fourth mention I noted is when Fanny Price who was accustomed to reading books in the great library of the mansion finds a book of sketches of slaves, and the daily tribulations they suffer, she is so overcome that she begins to cry as she turns the pages and finds one sketch after another more gruesome than the last. The patriarch walks up on her, and is angered that she has uncovered his book of \\"slaveography\\", after rudely sending her out of the library he is seen to be overcome with feelings of shame and starts to tear each page from the sketch book and throws it into the lit fireplace. Then he is seen to be in a state of remorse and guilt as the camera pans away from him sitting alone in the library.     The last scene to trivialize the unfortunate slaves in Antigua was towards the end, when Fanny Price is neatly putting in place the end of each character in the film for the sake of the viewer. She is telling how each one ended up, when she casually mentions that the Patriarch has now divested himself of the business of slave holding and trading and had found a new lucrative business concern which was tobacco, another slave related business!    \\"Djonga (Slavery)\\", a song by Salifu Keita which shows up at the end as the credits are running is one of the brighter spots of this film.
B004I8WD6E|4.0|It's a bit thick, with nice sized cutouts for the camera and buttons. I didn't use the screen protector, but the case is fine. It's replaced a slightly thinner case which was a bit too close-fitting around the controls.
0061726826|5.0|It's so fascinating to read all of the different worlds created in the minds of Dystopian fiction writers. This one is definitely original and is truly a world all its own. Lauren creates everything down to a Bible-esque book of rules the citizens of this society base each of their beliefs on, as well as fictional text from text books taught in the schools that are quoted before each chapter. I think one of the more haunting aspects of the book was the fact that this society is not all that different from our life today--same technology, same school system, same basic lifestyle etc. Then suddenly you are reminded every paragraph or so that these people aren't allowed to love. Not only that, but the majority don't want to and look forward to that ability being taken away. And then you realize that, even though they look to live the same as we do now, they are caged in and deluded. It's rather earth-shattering.     Also, the characters are just incredible. Lena's journey to awareness and discovery is so phenomenal, and it's a pleasure to take it with her. Alex is such a wonderful, POSITIVE love interest. I love books like this where the object of affection isn't some bad boy or someone that probably isn't the best option for the protagonist in the end. He's so real and, perhaps not perfect, but a wonderful fit for Lena. I adored Hana. I wasn't sure I would at first, but she wound up reminding me of my best friend in some ways and her friendship with Lena was beautiful and so true.     The only con I have really is that it took quite a few chapters for me to get into it. I don't think this was any fault of Lauren's. I think it was just having this entire world being built and having to establish how different a world without love would be.     Warning: The cliff-hanger will rip your heart out. That's all I'm sayin'. It was so so so beautifully written, it had me in tears and I read the last paragraph over and over, but it will gut you. I'm hoping the continuation restores hope.     Lauren's writing is something to be envied. Her turn of phrase is unique and poetic and I could read this story forever.

Right from the word go i truly enjoyed the author's deciptions of the towns, the people, and everything else.  The way she progressed through the sotry right up to the end was amazing and able to keep my ADD mind from wondering.  The way the characters grow, fight, survive, is just amazing.  The biggest issue I have is i want to see how the story ends but because its a series I need to buy the second book which needs to wait for payday!
0765350386|4.0|I've been hearing about Brandon Sanderson's fantasy efforts for several years now and didn't really decide to give him a go until news broke of his having been recruited to complete Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time saga.<br /><br />After researching his first two stand-alone pieces (Elantris and Warbreaker) I became disinterested in his whole brand of fantasy on account of the lack of genre purity present: Sanderson seemed fond of well constructed magical systems but seemed to cross into a bit of science fiction/ zombie horror/ humor in his prose.  Call it clich&eacute; if you must, but I typically aim for fantasy that is formulaic, epic in length, dry and fairly boring (hence my appreciation for Wheel of Time).<br /><br />My plan of attack was to wait for him to complete his first series, which turned out to be the Mistborn trilogy.  Once TOR saw fit to release the entire collection in a single paperback boxset, I decided I could ignore the recommendations from friends no longer.  Ready or not, I was going to jump into the realms of Brandon Sanderson.<br /><br />I will start with my initial feelings and work up to what made the book so enjoyable for me (and what makes it come so highly recommended).  Sanderson writes with a very flatfoot style for better or worse.  The good news is it is very easy to read, almost conversational by nature.  Sanderson narrates his tales as if he were recounting events with some pals during a camping trip opposed to the egotistical, borderline omnipotent tones you find in most epic fantasies.<br /><br />I personally appreciate this approach, as there is no old English nonsense and certainly no sentences structured simply to showcase the author's vocabulary (or impressive thesaurus skills).  The downside is don't expect poetry here either.  Word choices were clearly made to deliver a point, not dazzle the reader with descriptive prowess.<br /><br />Pacing is odd at best with the first half of the book struggling to find its rhythm.  I won't lie: I very nearly gave up at around the half-way point due to Sanderson's penchant for repeating the same points over and over and devoting entire 20+ page chapters to character planning and scheming.  Looking back now, it was probably done in attempt to fill pages and to stretch out the story a bit considering once things start happening, they happen quickly.  By the end of the book, I was hard pressed to put it down in fact.<br /><br />Unlike say George RR Martin or Steven Erikson, Sanderson doesn't feel the need to flop his tale across dozens of character viewpoints either.  In fact Mistborn is essentially told from a single perspective; that of teenage female Vin and her transformation from simple slave-girl to powerful sorceress.<br /><br />He manages to build a pretty interesting political & social structure along the way without relying on the massive scope associated with following multiple factions or warring legions and battalions.<br /><br />As surely summaries and countless critiques have suggested, magic plays an integral part of the prose and true to form, Sanderson delivers once again in the arena of a magic system that borders on science fiction.  This one in particular, Allomancy as it is called, is basically a melding of metallurgy with alchemy and a bit of digestive system workings added for good measure.  In and of itself, it's a solid idea but where Sanderson shines is in his ability to effectively describe fairly complicated concepts such as how to control bursts of flight or see a few moments into the future.<br /><br />The factor that I feel most lukewarm about would have to be the reliance upon the \\"heist\\" element; which bears a remarkable resemblance to \\"The Lies of Locke Lamora\\" by Scott Lynch.  This was probably coincidental as the novels were released within a few weeks of one another back in 2007, but it adds a slight young adult/ juvenility to an otherwise very adult conflict.<br /><br />Early on I feared that Sanderson was merelyanother example in the latest crop of modern fantasy writers (Patrick Rothfuss, Joe Abercrombie, and said Scott Lynch to mention a few) who water down their fantasy elements with thinly masked pop culture references and humor attempts but fortunately Sanderson rises above these pitfalls in his own way.<br /><br />There are some truths to complaints that Sanderson really shortchanges the secondary characters' depth and development but overall, after having just completed the tale last night, it is the main cast that carries the core through and through.<br /><br />Perhaps the greatest attribute is Sanderson's ability to create a genuine sense of hopelessness.  A lowly child overthrowing an entire empire is nothing new in fantasy but here we are given a truly hopeless cause that becomes even more hopeless as the story progresses.  The last ¾ of the book sets up a situation that will have even the most veteran of fantasy aficionados wondering how in the world Sanderson's going to pull it all together.  Take comfort that not only does he succeed but does so in expert style.<br /><br />Readers who fear that because this is a series rather than a stand-alone piece, it is destined to end on a cliffhanger need not be concerned.  Sanderson makes certain to tie up any potential loose ends by this book's conclusion.<br /><br />In all, a highly recommended read for fantasy devotes and non-fans alike for its ability to pull off quite an impressive conclusion.  Keep in mind that it doesn't start off with the type of momentum one would expect from a novel with this type of hype surrounding it, but it culminates into a very impressive piece of modern fantasy.Abercrombie, and said Scott Lynch to mention a few) who water down their fantasy elements with thinly masked pop culture references and humor attempts but fortunately Sanderson rises above these pitfalls in his own way.

B00070DK1E|1.0|Crest of a Knave is a terrible album.  Ian Anderson resembles Mark Knopfler from Dire Straits almost exactly (not to mention the songwriting feels like a generic early 80's Dire Straits song as well, such as something from their Love Over Gold album) but that's not really my biggest problem with Crest of a Knave.  After all, I enjoy Dire Straits.  I believe their debut album releasd in 1978 is a solid classic, in fact.      My problem with Crest of a Knave is that it completely ignores every single aspect of Jethro Tull that I loved, such as blending blues, hard rock, folk and classical elements together to create a highly original and unique sound.   Instead, Crest of a Knave paints us a picture of a band apparently attempting to be a secondrate Dire Straits wannabe act.  It's sickening.  Even the flute passages are generic and unmemorable.      Ian Anderson was having throat problems, which many of you are probably well aware of.  This tells me that he never should have bothered laying any of his vocals down on tape, or in all actuality, never should have released Crest of a Knave in the first place.  Why would I want to expose myself to a mediocre effort by a band obviously in the decline when there's a whole bunch of classic albums (from This Was to Stormwatch) that are significantly more worthy of my time?   Not a bad album for that entire stretch- not even the much criticized overblown aspects from A Passion Play reach such atrocious levels.    Please, skip 80's Jethro Tull completely.  Even their only relatively listenable 80's album -The Broadsword & the Beast- can't compete with their legendary 60's and 70's work.      \\"Budapest\\" is the most offensive song here because it doesn't illustrate anything interesting, musically.  For the entire 10 minutes,  I remain completely dissatisfied.  Where's the creative vocal melody we've come to expect out of Ian Anderson?  Oh right, he can't hit the same notes anymore *sigh*.  It's nice romantic dinner music, I suppose.  I hate romantic dinners.  \\"Farm on the Freeway\\" plods harmlessly like any number of predictably written generic 80's songs, and the flute plays in the most predictable way imaginable and resembles a band running out of songwriting ideas in a hurry.  The guitar solo in the middle is alright I suppose, but it's surrounded by a mediocre vocal melody and flute playing, so it's unsavable and not worth anybody's time.    Please, skip this album and remember Jethro Tull for the huge pile of classic albums they created many years before this crappy album was ever released.
0767903862|5.0|My favorite Bill Bryson book, and overall, one of my favorite books.  Informative but just hilarious.  It was my first Bryson read, and it exceeded any expectations I had.  Makes you want to go to Australia, that's for sure!
B003I55BIA|5.0|I never wanted to put this book down! When I first stumbled upon this book, I thought it was going to be just another fast, easy read to help pass my time at work. I'm glad I was wrong! This book kept me interested from beginning to end! Even though this type of plot has been written before, this one had it's own little twists. I loved that the main character was not annoying like other female leads in other books. She didn't instantly fall for the \\"bad boy\\" character. The attraction and feelings between Brittany and Alex developed over time. I highly recommend this book!
044654759X|4.0|What I enjoyed most about this Sparks' book is that its different - there's suspense, mystery, and romance. The way he wrote it made it very easy to imagine what the characters look like, how their expressions are when certain things are said, and they were just enjoyable characters to read about. Overall, its probably one of his better written books. One downfall is that I wished he wrote a little bit more after the ending, but I guess he left it up to our imaginations.
1594744769|4.0|I am admittedly a cover fanatic.  I cannot resist a good cover, unfortunately the story contained within the cover doesn't always live up to that initial hook.<br /><br />While I wasn't displeased with Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children, I do admit to having struggled a little bit with it.  Honestly, were it not for the inclusion of some of the most peculiar, fascinating photos I've ever seen, I don't think the story would have had enough strength to stand on its own two feet.<br /><br />However, because the pictures and the story were blended together so incredibly well (although it felt a bit stilted toward the beginning, at times feeling as if the story had been forced into fitting with the pictures, this improved through the book very quickly) the story takes on a more masterful life of its own and about 50 pages in or so I was hooked and couldn't put the book down.  It was those initial 50 pages though that has me struggling with my opinion on the book overall.<br /><br />Because, frankly, that first part was slow.  Even a death, pictures and strange things happening couldn't keep my interest and I had to force myself to keep going knowing just how much I loved the cover and how much I'd been anticipating this book. I was rewarded though, so please don't be put off by that part, I just felt it was necessary to give full disclosure regarding why I feel so torn.<br /><br />The last half of the book was fascinating, filled with adventure, fun, spookiness and mystery.  I loved getting to know the \\"peculiars\\", I loved every moment that I turned the page to see a new picture and I loved following Jacob's journey as he found out about his history as well as his own special talents.  In some ways, I was almost reminded of the new X-Men movie which made me laugh and appreciate this WWII/Modern story even more.<br /><br />This was dark, twisted, exhilarating fantasy - just push through those opening scenes if they don't immediately grab you because you will be rewarded.  And the pictures make this one a great addition to anyone's shelf.e a great addition to anyone's shelf.
B002ZG99IG|1.0|When I first saw the previews of this movie I thought this film was going to be great. When I finally saw it i was very disappointed. The acting is terrible, scenes are very predictable. Overall just terrible film. Its like they try to remake single white female except it takes place in college.
B001EC3JME|4.0|Yes it is very tight at 1st. I am using this for a small 1\\" diameter flashlight and after a couple days the holster conformed to the flashlight and now fits in good yet still holds. Yes its an open top design but the before mentioned dust and rain shouldnt matter if your using a decent quality flashlight. I wear this 5-6 days a week and have had no real issues. I think most of the bad reviews are from ppl reviewing the product before they know how to use it or give it a chance. I say get 1 if you need a good holster
B001F290E4|4.0|Not a huge Seal fan but when I heard this CD I was amazed!! His sounded great for the tone in all of the songs!  Loved it!
B004LFO0FG|4.0|At this point in Britney Spears' career one has to wonder who is really in charge... She has no control of her business holdings (being under some sort of court-appointed charge) and no control over her sons (custody being given to their dad) but she is still out there making music.... Or is she? Here comes Britney's 7th studio album.<br /><br />\\"Femme Fatale\\" (12 tracks; 44 min.) starts with one of the best tracks dance tracks I've heard in a looooong time, the exhuberant \\"Till the World Ends\\", which I can't stop playing, and followed by the equally charging \\"Hold It Against Me\\", just terrific. Both were hit singles, and obviously so. Great tracks follow, with a nice \\"Inside Out\\" and then followed by the best track on here \\"I Wanna Go\\", an equally all-out party song. The first half of the album, finishing with track 6 \\"(Drop Dead) Beautiful)\\" is flawless, period. The second half is okay, but not as compelling. There are a couple of nice tracks, for sure. But as the album flows along, one of the striking things is how \\"robotized\\" Britney's vocals are. I mean, is it really her singing, or some machine? Hard to tell. Nevermind, as I have enjoyed this album much more than I anticipated.<br /><br />This is \\"Spears, Inc.\\" in full bloom, and is it a bad thing as such? Not really. Compare this album to, say, the over-hyped \\"Born This Way\\" album by Lady Gaga. I'll take this album over \\"Born This Way\\" in a heartbeat. I took my daughter to several Britney Spears concerts back in the day (I'm talking early 00's) and always enjoyed it. Now my daughter is 21 and I won't go see anymore Britney concerts. But it won't stop me from enjoying this album, which is much better than either of the \\"Blackout\\" or \\"Circus\\" albums. Let's call \\"Femme Fatale\\" a nice guilty pleasure, period.
0316056863|4.0|If you are looking for snark, you have come to the right place.  Tina Fey doesn't wait to get into the story of her life before she hits you with some excellent one liners, she starts right with the blurbs.  \\"Absolutely delicious!\\" (A Guy Who Eats Books ) or \\"Totally worth it.\\" (Trees ) and I bet she wrote both of these herself.  The book starts out with the story of how she got her famous scar and yes, it is a horrible story but it also points out how Fey used the attack to her advantage since it put her directly in the spotlight.  She really turned a negative into a positive with this.<br /><br />The book delves into her life from different perspectives and I just can't help but think I missed something.  There is a lot of insecurity and a bit of sadness mixed in with her successful front.  That is a theme I think carries through almost every memoir I have ever read by a comedian.  I really felt that there is a lot of \\"I am really successful\\" but got that feeling of reading an US magazine section where they point out pictures of celebrities that are \\"JUST LIKE US\\".  Overall, I did enjoy it since I an a fan of celebrity memoirs.  Don't look down on me, someone has to read them!  I am just confident enough to say it in public.
B000TGJ80S|5.0|I strongly feel that THIS is the best Dracula film ever made. Unfortunately Bram Stoker's Dracula is highly under-rated and over looked today by what I would consider contemporary snobbery resulting in a divisiveness of any film lacking in the over-saturation of obvious and unrealistic computer effects and the fashion of mocking such actors as Keanu Reeves.                  No other version of Dracula has come this close to following the original novel by Bram Stoker.   This film is the most faithful adaptation of Dracula to date and it also gives depth and personality to Dracula that no previous version had before.               There are some changes from the original novel but it does not hinder the story but rather enhances it.   In this film Dracula and Mina were in love with each other and Dracula is more or less redeemed through love, and other than that embellishment is, to date, the most faithful film adaptation of the Dracula novel by Bram Stoker. This film is beautiful and very Faustian. But don't think that romantic and humanistic redemption makes this like the sappy, sparkly vampires you see in the undeserving of mention- Twilight. Dracula, in this version of the story, can still be frightening, sinister, seductive, manipulative and intimidating and yet masterfully balanced with sympathy, compassion and romance for the character. For this reason I have to say it has the best portrayed Dracula in... well... ever.
B004EPZ07U|4.0|First off I am not a Green Lantern comic reader. Outside of the few justice league episodes I've seen, I knew relatively nothing about the Green Lantern series before going. So I'm not going to be one of those reviewers that are flaming it because it doesn't stick to the source material. I'm just reviewing it coming from a comic book movie fan.<br /><br />The movie was very entertaining. Ryan Reynolds did a great job at humor but at the same time it wasn't full of Reynolds-isms...That was one of my fears with the movie was that Reynolds would turn it into one big joke but he didn't. I thought the story was pretty good (although from what I understand on the net it is WILDLY different than the comics).  The foreshadowing was a little heavy handed though I thought.<br /><br />**Spoilers**<br /><br />I kind of thought that some of the guardian elements were poorly done though. I find it strange that they are supposed to be these immensely intelligent people but Sinestro so easily convinced them to harness the power of fear. But really that's my only qualm with the story. I know they wanted to set up a second movie but that was a little over the top. They could have done a better job there.<br /><br />**End Spoilers**<br /><br />Overall the movie was entertaining, and a joy to see. I'll probably buy it when it comes out along with X-men first class. If you are a comic book movie fan then this is a must see.
0525423273|5.0|What I liked: The characters were well developed, some slowly, some quickly, throughout the book. I am a big fan of acknowledgement of side characters and was glad we got to learn a little bit about Anna's friends in Paris. The setting was amazing and while I guess you can't really go wrong with Paris it could end up just falling flat if not carried well. Not the case here. Perkins really brought France to the book, I felt like I was right there with Anna experiencing these things for the first time and being amazed. (Side note, now I really want to go to Paris...)<br /><br />The school itself was very interesting, I have always had a thing for boarding school books and the experience of being away from home and trying to find her footing was well written and fascinating. Perkins managed to get inside Anna's head in the best way possible and make it easy to relate to her character (being pushed around by her parents, trouble with relationships and friends) and made all the conflicts entirely believable.<br /><br />I LOVED St.Clair (enough emphasis for you?). Even though he had some flaws (see below) in the end he really pulled through and just made the story absolutely perfect for me. I thought Anna's character was awesome. She was quirky and unique and someone I would definitely want to be friends with in real life. She did try very hard to hurt anyone and her vulnerability made her even more loveable.<br /><br />What I disliked: The on again/off again-ness of many of the relationships in the book. I don't really want to say more than that in case you haven't read it yet but I thought everyone was a bit silly and dithery. Even while saying that I can definitely see similarities between the book and real life, of people being scared to step outside of their comfort zone and try something new and scary but I still wanted to poke the Anna and St. Clair into action every once in a while. I felt like Anna just let herself be pulled around by outside events instead of standing up for herself and what she wanted.<br /><br />Final Thoughts: The characters and setting were perfectly depicted and they better not screw that up f they make a movie or I can see legions of fans being maaaaad.<br /><br />It was an adorable, slightly typical love story in an atypical setting (or typical if you live in France I guess...) and it managed to be absolutely perfect. The balance between drama and angst and the parts I actually wanted to read (about France and Anna's life) was great and the combination led to an amazingly sweet story that I will definitely be reading again and am happy to recommend to you.d what she wanted.

B001ECQ75A|5.0|Honestly, I am in my early twenties and think that this movie is one of the best movies ever made by Dreamworks. This movie has no crude or vulgar elements to it which for some reason many people my age have always thought to be funny. It is genuinely funny from beginning to end, has a great story, and is very beautifully done. There is always a message in it and Jack Black's character is not just another mindless, obnoxious character that are so many adored today. His character is very funny and has a great attitude throughout.   So again a movie that has no vulgarity and is genuinely funny with a lesson at the end...When else can you get that in a kid's movie nowadays? GREAT movie. Definite 5 stars
0307595862|5.0|i was so excited to read this book...just discovered jo nesbo last year when i read \\"the devils star\\", realized afterward that it was the third translated book in the series, and immediately ordered \\"redbreast\\" and \\"nemesis\\" , both of which i loved.  Harry is such a tragic hero...you can't help but love him and root for him, even as his actions make you cringe...i then read \\"the redeemer\\", also a great book...one thing i noticed in \\"the snowman\\" is that the translation seems a bit more Americanized than in prior translations...not sure i liked that aspect, but the story itself was thrilling, up to the very end. I do recommend reading earlier books first, as there are so many references a new reader will not appreciate.  That said, as a stand alone thriller, \\"the snowman\\" was excellent...but there is so much more to be gained by reading all of nesbo's books.  I just ordered \\"the leopard\\" and can't wait for it to arrive! One comment...many sites compare Nesbo to Stieg larsson...as a reader of both authors, i prefer nesbo...salander is a compelling and intriguing character, but harry hole is my new favorite!
B003Y5H54W|3.0|OK - this was a pretty well done film. An interesting take on the original fairy tale. It was beautifully filmed, had some interesting scenes, all-around decent character development, and an interesting plot. However, it was ruined by three things:    1) a hokey ending. They could have been more imaginative.     2) non-white characters in a classic, medieval European setting. Please, if there's anything worse than a blatantly racist film, it's one where they try too hard to place non-white characters where everyone with a brain knows they wouldn't be - don't insult the audience. I understand the importance of \\"inclusion\\", but this was just plain stupid.     3) the romantic male lead's hair was way too modern and trendy. Where - tell me EXACTLY where - did he find the hair gel for that \\"do\\" of his?!? Was there a magical hair gel pond? Were there magical hair gel elves in the forest? The obvious comic relief his hair provided wasn't enough to excuse or suspend the disbelief that a male in the era/place this film took place would have hair like that!
B000PC0U1W|5.0|This is a really great movie and I recommend it for everyone! One of the my favourite movies ever. 5/5 stars, easily!
B000NVL9FQ|5.0|Here it is 40 years later after first hearing this album as a freshman on a crummy little stereo in my dorm room where I was totally amazed at the sounds coming from the junky speakers.    Now at 58, and with a terrific stereo (Jeff Rowland & Thiel), I am even more amazed.  These guys were incredibly talented and I think this is their best work after all is said and done.  Even if they had pulled a Blind Faith on us, and only released this album, I think it would still be relevant today.  I do not much care for Tarkus, Pictures, or Trilogy, and do not play them anymore as they did not age well for me.  BSS has some great moments such as Toccata and it is still in rotation in my library.  But it is this first album that I think is overall the most consistently interesting and exciting of all their \\"Works\\".      I thank them for their use of classical music in their repertoire, as it steered me toward hearing the original works such as Pictures and Sinfonietta by Janacek.  I discovered The Nice and that led me to Sibelius and Tchaikovsky among other.  Now my primary choice of music to listen to is classical but it was the influences of ELP, along with Jon Lord, Rick Wakeman, and a few others that took me in that direction.      The sound quality of this cd is truly wonderful and even if you have older versions, it is worth getting if you really like this album.  After 40 years, along with Fragile, Machine Head, and a few others, it still is some powerful and complex music and has much to offer the listener.  This review is for the Shout Factory reissue.
B003VANOFY|5.0|The sound from this unit lives up to my expectations. I feel like i have an edge over other gamers with the sound produced from this set. my movies and music are very enjoyable too. espacially if watching blu ray with power dd 11. sound is just breath taking
B003J27WFW|5.0|For me, the best thing about this film is that it shows three normal guys who just happen to be amazing musicians. A three-piece band that sounds better than some of the bands out there who sport six members.      The beginning roots of the band was interesting, and also all the crap they had to deal with from critics. In the end, their music speaks much louder than any half-baked rock critic who just couldn't understand the band. Also, the 2112 period where they talked about this, and how it was a battle cry against people who wanted them to not do their own thing. They basically wanted Rush to sell out, and their answer was 2112. Excellent answer.      But the part that's probably talked about the most is, the section dealing with Neil Peart's personal losses, and how the other two guys in the band waited for him to heal. Most bands would have been stupid enough to actually try and replace a person who many consider to be the most talented drummer in the world. But Geddy and Alex stuck by him and waited it out. The end result was Vapor Trails, and a tour that got these guys back on stage.      Even if you are just a casual Rush listener, do yourself a favor and check this DVD out. You'll be able to say you've seen one of the best films on a huge rock band ever made.
1595141979|4.0|from Murphy's Library    On the third book of the Vampire Academy series Rose is dealing with her grief about Mason's death. She can't help herself but feeling reponsible for what happened--although she knows there's nothing she can do about it anymore, she keeps thinking about the what ifs situations. Meanwhile, the St. Vladimir's novices are facing their first field experience: they're suppose to spend 6 weeks as real guardians of Moroi students, and while all her colleagues are anxious to find out who they're gonna protect, Rose's pretty confident Lissa will be the one she'll be assigned with. However, when Eddie is assigned to protect the last Dragomir, she ends up with Christian.    When Rose starts to see what she believes is Mason's ghost, things get complicated. And she also finds out that Victor Dashkov's trial is coming soon--but neither her or Lissa are going to be there to testify about what happened. She begs Dimitri to help bring them in, but when they're called to go with Dimitri having nothing to do with it, Rose knows who did it: Adrian. And it's when she's on the Court that Rose speaks with Queen Tatiana for the first time--and learns some shocking news about the Queen's intentions.    On Shadow Kiss, Rose realizes an important aspect of her bond with Lissa. There's a lot of Rose/Dimitri action, and a lot of tension too. The ending left me speechless--and I got Blood Promise right away, I couldn't wait any other second to start reading it. Who am I kidding? I've been reading this series no stopping for days now, every book is the same way: I finish one and start the next one without even blinking.
B0002NRQTI|5.0|There's something about this Rush CD that makes me love playing it late at night. Probably the fact that the songs are a mix of mellow Rush, and the more progressive Rush we've all come to love over the years. Double Agent, for example, is a dreamy tune that sounds like a heavier track, conjuring far away landscapes in your mind.      Yes, I wouldn't compare this one to Moving Pictures, 2112, or Permanent Waves. But, it's far from a bad release. Just don't buy it expecting the old Rush from the 70's, and approach it with an open mind-you'll probably come love it.      Neil Peart's drumming is as precise as on any other recording. The guy is a human drum machine that never misses a beat. There's no Geddy Lee high-pitched wails, but like Peart on drums, his bass playing is never boring. Lifeson's riffs always stand out no matter what he's playing.      So, you basically have an album with three amazing musicians playing on it. You can't go wrong. Forget about what you've heard about Rush's middle period, or 90's sound, and just wait till midnight, light a smoke, sit back and let these three guys take you far away from the stressful noise of the real world.
142311339X|5.0|from Murphy's Library -- rated 4 and a half there    I have to warn you: if you haven't finished or haven't read at all the Percy Jackson series, you should do it before reading The Lost Hero. The book can be spoilerish for those who haven't read the adventures of Percy before, but don't fear, you can understand the new series without a problem if you don't want to get to know Percy yet.    The Lost Hero is set on the same universe as Percy Jackson & the Olympians was. The book is the first in a new series, called The Heroes of Olympus and introduces us to three main new characters.    We have now Jason, a boy who has no memory, Leo, who is the handsman of this story, the one that makes things happen, and Piper, who has the habilities and surprises everyone. On a field trip for students of a school for troubled kids, the story begans with its \\"Olympus' side\\".    From the moment the action begins until the very end of this book we are all in a roller coaster. We see--or hear about--Percy, who will play a role in this series, and the gods and discover that Hera, apparentely, has gone missing. Jason, Leo and Piper are all having dreams, strange dreams, with Hera in the middle, and they have as a mission the need to find her.    I need to confess something: I liked The Lost Hero so much more than all Percy Jackson books. While Percy was great and his adventures made me cheer for him all the time, the new trio made me feel like part of this story. The mithology in this one was wonderful, and had more depth.    The change on point of view didn't bother me, as it was really organized and helped the author to tell the individual stories of each new character. And, yeah, I loved the trio! It was a long time ago when three main characters got me this way. They all are part of the same quest, but they are such strong individuals that would be a shame if we didn't get to know them better. Points to Riordan.    The book give you all the clues you need, and it isn't really surprising if you pay attention and like to guess, but if you just enjoy the ride you will be having OMG moments.    Do I recommend this book? Hell yeah! What are you waiting for to read it?
B0054R6BFM|5.0|my teenage daughter got this book and i started reading it so we could discuss it.  the book allows the others to understand how they played a part in the main characters choice to kill herself.  it was interesting to read since there's two narrators so you get to see things from two different view points.  allows you see the surface damage we do to others while experiencing the real pain they feel.  suicide is a personal choice one makes and when they dont leave a note or reason why to those they leave behind we're left like Clay in the beginning wondering &#34;why&#34; when life didn't seem that bad.  Thank you for the book it was a quick read and broke my heart all over again.  it's been almost 2 years nows and i will always have to love you from a far and in my memories but i never stop thinking of you Danny and asking myself &#34;why&#34;.

1400052181|5.0|The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is well-written, informative, and reads like a novel even though it is a true story involving a poor black woman, her family, and how her cells have benefited mankind and made her \\"immortal.\\"  Henrietta died of cervical cancer in 1951 leaving six children, including one daughter only one year old.  Her cancer was extremely fast-spreading, and cells from a slice of her tumor kept reproducing and did not die like most human cells eventually do.  Her cells have been shipped to researchers all over the world and used to develop treatments for all kinds of diseases, including polio and cancer. One company started an entire business of sending out \\"Hela cells\\" to researchers.  That company and others have made a lot of money from Hela cells, but her children grew up very poor.  I won't tell you more, but it is definitely worth reading, and is a good Book Group book.
B001BLRPCS|5.0|I know I'm really behind in my music listening. There is absolutely no comparison to The White Stripes. I listened to The White Stripes second album, \\"De Stijl\\" and honestly wasn't surprised that it was complete crap. The Black Keys have soul on their side and the guitar riffs are insane. This CD is gritty, bluesy heaven. It will stay on repeat in my cd player as well as my ipod.

6305313687|4.0|I remember when I was a kid the most I knew of American History X was the curb stomping scene. I didn't know anything more about the movie, so prior to seeing the movie the message was obviously not being translated properly within the minds of my peers. Looking back, though, that was fine by me as I'm mulatto and the friends who introduced the stories of American History X to me were all white, meaning they didn't have any of the personal issues the film mainly referred to.    Recently though, I mean within a week of writing this review I have a friend who told me that he would have loved this movie had it not been for the ending (he didn't quite say it that way, but the ending ruined it for him which is the same in my small little mind). I think this is largely due to the editing of the movie putting the focus in an area that kind of throws our reasoning of the movie slightly off.  For those of you who may not have seen American History X here's a little break down of the plot: Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton), an open white supremacist, has been in prison for several years due to the voluntary manslaughter of a couple of black people who tried to carjack him. On the day of his release his brother Danny (Edward Furlong), after turning in an assignment advocating Hitler's Mein Kampf, is required to write a history paper based on Derek's experience.    First, I would like to say that this film is brilliant. In its exploration of white supremacy it views all of our stereotyping as a gateway to more virulent hate. Despite it's, at times, extremely violent imagery, X is very much a call for reform in the way that we think of race and of each other as individuals. Many people will, and have, found this movie preachy, but in my opinion it's not as preachy as other race related movies that others have \\"campaigned\\" against that I have enjoyed (i.e. Crash).    The ending is still quite a point of contention though, and with good reason. As I mentioned before, I think this owesa lot to the editing of this movie. Unfortunately, director Tony Kaye was unable to offer an edit of the movie that the studio was willing to work with, and other editors were brought in and Norton assisted with the editing. The result was an edit of the movie that was extremely Norton heavy, although the finished movie was still thoroughly enjoyable. That also meant the message of the movie was fairly diluted.    Viewing the movie from my perspective, though, the story was actually speaking to everyone trying to reform Danny through Derek's story. Sure partially to the movie's detriment the story is overly focused on Derek, but Danny is our way into the story of the movie and he also represents the audience. He's exploring the story of his brother, as we are, because he needs to learn something from it. The whole reason for that exploration: to turn back before it's too late.    It's easy to miss that point in the wake of the ending, but if you allow yourself to bypass the end, you'd realize that it really represents the seemingly never ending circulation of hate. Trying not to give away the ending, this is really what we see. Danny has given in to the story of Derek and has freed himself of the hate that once consumed him, but he passed it on to another person who willingly partakes of that hate. It's a cycle that we need to break, and that's really what the ending, including the ending Abraham Lincoln quote signifies.    I highly recommend this movie. I know some people will find it contrived, and a little too on the nose, but I feel there is quite a bit of drama to offset the preachiness of this film. The only other issue that I had with this particular film concerns a score that over emphasizes moments of the movie as grandiose or too foreboding considering the more documentary like style of the shoot. Overall, though, I think it effectively evokes emotion while conveying a message to end the cycle of hate.    4.5/5    For more review check out: <...>
B004QYZATW|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. It does remind me of the movies from the 50's with its beautiful rich hues and charming musical orchestrations. It has the simplicity of that era, and the visual brilliance of the technicolor of that period that seemed to make fabrics jump off the screen. I found myself hypnotized by the beauty of it all. Plus, there is the wonderful background--Venice, Italy.     Yes, I had read plenty of poor reviews for this movie, and I avoided it when it was in the theater because of the reviews. However, now I wish I had experienced this film on the big screen.    For me, it is a movie I will enjoy over and over again for its stunning visual effects. Angelina's beauty compliments this film (however, I must admit I was a bit uncomfortable with her tiny size). And, while I haven't watched a film with Johnny Depp in a while, I forgot how much I admired his screen presence. For some reviewers, there was no chemistry between Jolie and Depp. I, on the contrary, felt chemistry between them. For some reviewers, both actors played their roles insipidly, I enjoyed the subtleties of their performances.
B0009A40ES|4.0|\\"There are better ways of taking care of Bret Easton Ellis than just censoring him. I would much prefer to see him skinned alive, a rat put up his rectum, and his genitals cut off and fried in a frying pan, in front of - not only a live audience - but a video camera as well. These videos can be sold as \\"art\\" and \\"free expression\\" and could be available at every video outlet, library, liquor, and convenience store in the world. We can profit off of Ellis' terror and pain, just as he and bookstores are profiting off of the rape, torture, and mutilation of women.\\"    This is a comment from feminist activist Tara Baxter concerning Bret Easton Ellis' 1991 novel American Psycho. Due to its graphic violent content and (mis)perceived misogyny, Ellis' novel has seen its fair share of controversy, including Baxter seeking out copies in book stores to dump blood on them. Naturally, in spite of or because of the controversy the book became a bestseller, which in Hollywood means that it must be acquired to become the next big movie!    Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is an average investment banking executive on Wall Street. So average in fact that he's often confused for other executives within the same firm. Underneath the façade lies the heart of a psychopathic killer that he keeps hidden from the rest of the world. As his hatred for the world intensifies, though, his murderous tendencies become more and more apparent.    Satire is something that can be hard to pull off. It must remain subtle while at the same time being clear to viewers that you have a purpose and a message; your subtext should be near the surface but never overt. A lot of times satire is timely, but that doesn't mean that it'll remain timely into the future, so it must also have entertainment value that extends well beyond its perceived time frame. American Psycho does a great job on all of these fronts.    Ellis' book actually is more of a critique on male behavior than a work seeking to lash out at women. Painting with extreme brush strokes makes the comparison more overt, but for those not seeking the true meaning of the piece the subtext is completely lost. The story of a man trying to fit in where he doesn't belong, with a dark streak underneath he keeps hidden from the world becomes a story of an author who is out to demoralize women. One has to wonder how many of American Psycho's detractors actually sat down to analyze the book beyond the violent passages.    The violence in the movie was toned down quite a bit, which is naturally a necessity if you want a rating that still allows you to sell tickets. Don't get me wrong though: this still isn't a movie for the kiddies. The character is still an exaggerated form of the typical misogynist man, but the film focuses more on the inherent humor of the situation rather than on the violence.    Christian Bale is the key here. Bale has a sixth sense for playing characters trying to keep it cool on the outside with turmoil underneath and a secret waiting to be shared with the world, but here there's a bit more levity and comedy to his performance. In particular the scene where he dispatches condescending executive Paul Allen shows his slightly more dark comedic side. Dancing around to Huey Lewis while donning a rain coat and carrying an ax, one can't help but laugh at Bale's manic energy while also questioning if they should.    There's also that intensity that Bale brings to every role that is just kind of creepy disturbing. At one point in the film several executives compare business cards. To the viewer these cards look exactly the same from the paper they're printed on to the font used, but to the execs they all look different with each one being classier than the last. As Bale's Patrick Bateman views these you can see and feel his desperation as each card becomes progressively better than his. With this \\"Mine is bigger than yours\\" game, Bale demonstrates just how versatile an actor he can be when demonstrating the emotions of someone who doesn't want to be found out for who they really are.    This film is brilliant in its eccentricities and its subtlety within an outrageous casing. If you haven't seen it I highly recommend that you give it a try. Whether you're a fan of Christian Bale, horror, lurid tales, or satire in general this is a must watch, and for some of you out there a must own!    4/5    For more reviews check out: jasoncwilkerson.blogspot.com
B003YQ1QUA|5.0|I'm not really into jazz, so I normally wouldn't buy or listen to a record like this. But I saw Ms. Spalding on the Grammy awards and her spirit and talent were so apparent and infectious, I went outside of my usual musical taste (classic rock) and bought this jazz record. I've enjoyed it from the very first listen, and I'm still playing it frequently now months later. Wonderful new music I've been turned on to.
B00000G3PA|3.0|I'm sure we all have those movies that we loved when we were kids that still hold special places in our heart. We can see the reviews, see the plot holes and how incoherent they really are, how bad some of the acting is, and yet we remain nostalgic for these films. Armageddon came out during the summer after my freshman year of high school; a time when I didn't care whether a film's scientific principles were in line with reality and plot took a backseat to action. Having said that, I would still argue that Armageddon is possibly Michael Bay's second best film after The Rock.    I'm sure you already know the plot for this film but here's a recap just in case: Earth is threatened by an asteroid the size of Texas and NASA director Dan Truman (Billy Bob Thornton) is tasked with finding a way to keep this asteroid from obliterating life on the planet. In desperation he turns to the best oil driller he could find, Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis), and his team to land on the asteroid and implant a nuke into the asteroid to blow it apart and avoid hitting the planet.    If anything Armageddon is a fun movie. A large part of the reason for this is the cast, in particular Stamper's team of oil drilling misfits which includes: Ben Affleck, Will Patton, Steve Buscemi, Owen Wilson, Michael Clarke Duncan, and Ken Hudson Campbell. The interactions between these roughnecks and the scientific community at NASA is what brings out a lot of the humor in the story, and the script co-written by JJ Abrams (Lost, Alias, Fringe, Star Trek, Mission Impossible 3) mines that territory for all that it's worth. I also feel the need to give a shout out at this point to the always brilliant Peter Stormare (Fargo, The Big Lebowski) as the vodka soaked cosmonaut Lev Andropov, he's quite hilarious!    Not all of the performances hit the proper marks though. Ben Affleck does an overall serviceable job, but at times his performance is slightly over the top when he veers into more comedic territory whichdoesn't help with blending the character into one cohesive whole. The worst offender though is Liv Tyler, who in my opinion has only proven to be a fully competent actress in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Her \\"performance\\" ruins an emotionally climactic scene toward the end of the movie.    Michael Bay's sense of patriotism has always proven to be a blessing and a curse when it comes to his flicks. On the one hand he ends up getting a lot of help from the government, which here meant a lot of unbridled access to NASA facilities and even some of their developing technology from the time. This access allows for a sense of authenticity that some other filmmakers are unable to attain. At the same time though, he shows some ignorance when it comes to America's importance in global matters as we see the entire world listening to a presidential address on a global issue. Most Americans wouldn't be listening to the address let alone in other countries.    Being that this is a Michael Bay movie there's very little need to comment on the plot, if you go into a Bay film expecting anything less than an extremely over the top and somewhat implausible plot than you have no idea what you're getting into. It's a blessing and a curse of Michael Bay films, and it's really up to the viewer to determine at what level they can suspend disbelief. To me a bigger problem with Bay's direction, though, is his inability to set up establishing shots and to stop moving the camera. Sometimes setting up a single shot without movement allows more intensity than continuous movement, something that Bay rarely seems to understand.    All in all this is a serviceable movie, a lot of fun with great magnetic characters. The plot is over the top and slightly incoherent at times, but it's also packed with action and humor. For that reason I give it a partial recommendation, and that's still largely for nostalgia's sake. If you haven't seen it maybe you should give it a try.    2.5/5    For more reviews check out: [...]
031261246X|5.0|Reading sci-fi novels is often a good way to get a chuckle about how impossible, or at least, implausible, the science or techniques are behind the plot. Geeks notice this and it often bothers us. Sure it's fine if you're in a setting intentionally set far in the future and maybe on a different planet, or in space, but when it's about present or near-present day Earth, the technology should really match what is available today.    In Zero Day, it does. Mark, having written software so amazing and helpful that Microsoft bought him and his software, gave him a high position, and released his utilities as either free stuff for the benefit of everyone or as part of some high-powered add-ons with certain licenses for companies. So he knows his stuff and what is possible. He regularly blogs about cleaning malware from computers using manual techniques and tricks (and his free tools, usually), especially when the regular utilities won't work because the infection is too new (he finds the source deep in the system).    And now he took that knowledge and wrote a (fortunately) fictional (for now) book about the potential terrorists have to mess with us using technology and a little coding smarts that is quite plausible with present technology. And he does this while creating a good story with likable characters, a good plot, and a cliched if not appropriate story line. The pattern is definitely \\"thriller\\" standard fare; if you know the genre the pacing and plot of the book will feel familiar. You might even guess a few plot twists, or at least not be terribly surprised by them. But they are mostly chosen well and the story is cohesive with good pacing. Usually you have to settle for a \\"just ok\\" plot and accuracy, or a great plot with horrible inaccuracies, but your inner geek will be happy in both respects here.    At the same time, while the technology bits are accurate and enjoyable, understanding everything is not required to enjoy or understand the story, and it's explained well enough that any layperson should be able to at least get the gist enough to enjoy the story, so it's not geek-only fare. (It's also a cautionary tale that especially non-geeks need desperately to read, so make sure it gets around!)    The best part is the ending is not a cliffhanger, leaving you hanging for another book to finish (though not every last thread is tied up neatly, most are)...but there's a gaping wide hole screaming \\"sequel\\" you can see through the last page :-) I highly recommend reading this book. Especially if you're a geek.
B0034G4P8A|4.0|Comic book fans get a lot of flak for being nerds, dweebs and geeks; or at least they used to. Now comics are en vogue as millions of people attend geekfests like Comic Con; although whether that's to see the movie and television stars in attendance remains to be seen. Comic book characters are our mythology, they rival the super powered beings and gods of ancient Greek, Mesopotamian, and Viking mythology. We as humans have always felt this need to look up to higher powers to sort out our lives, believing that the fate of our race is better left in the hands of someone capable of bending the rules of physics. It's only natural then that eventually the worlds of comics and ancient mythology would collide as it does in the new Marvel movie Thor.    Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is the arrogant first born son of King Odin (Anthony Hopkins) of Asgard, and the rightful heir to the throne. When Thor commits an act that could lead to war between Asgard and the Frostgiants, with whom they have a very shaky truce, Odin strips Thor of his powers and banishes him to Earth until he learns humility. On Earth Thor is found by astrophysicist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and her team (Stellan Skarsgard, Kat Dennings) as they study atmospheric disturbances in New Mexico.    Thor is one of Marvel's lesser known properties, despite having been created by Stan Lee back in 1962. An integral character in Marvel's super powered team The Avengers, the movie version of the comic book was announced not long after the success of Iron Man as part of Marvel Studios attempt to bring The Avengers to the big screen. While Marvel has had great success with the first Iron Man movie and to a lesser extent Iron Man 2 and The Incredible Hulk (which is the closest Marvel Studios has come to failure so far), Thor was a risky proposition with the greatest potential for failure. How does one meld the worlds of the mythical Asgard and Earth seamlessly into a movie that is part of a bigger picture with charactersthat are based solely in our realm?    Enter Kenneth Branagh. The success of Thor can largely be pinned on having a filmmaker with appropriate gravitas to ground the film. Branagh is a star of stage as well as film (for those of you unfamiliar with the name he played Gilderoy Lockhart in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets). The presence of Branagh alone was somewhat curious considering he's known more for directing acclaimed works like Hamlet (1996) and Henry V (1989) and even as an Irishman the English consider him one of the leaders in Shakespearean theater. It's that knowledge of film and theater that really guides Thor as he borrows as much from Shakespeare's Henry V as he does from modern action films.    Also adding to the weight of Kenneth Branagh's credentials are a list of acclaimed and award winning actors and actresses such as Anthony Hopkins, Natalie Portman, Stellan Skarsgard, Rene Russo, and Idris Elba. Not only do they have the opportunity to ground the movie, but they also look like they're having fun. Part of why we enjoy this movie is because we can see that they enjoy the movie. No one ever really feels like they're hamming it up or sleepwalking through their scenes, you get the sense that aside from the emotions they convey for their characters concerning their predicaments they all want to be on this set and that feeling is infectious. Also Tom Hiddleston's Loki is a revelation at a time when I have to admit that Marvel Studio's previous villains have been lacking a certain je ne sais que. Hiddleston plays the character with a secret, and a glimmer behind the eyes that slowly unravels like a ripe onion throughout the film holding on to his deceit with the hope of another day. He's more complex than the previous villains that have come out of Marvel Studios, and I'm looking forward to his return in The Avengers.    The real linchpin for why this all works though is Chris Hemsworth. While having been around here and there in blink and you'llmiss it parts, Hemsworth got his first big break in JJ Abrams Star Trek reboot in the pivotal role of George Kirk, father of James T. Kirk. While his place in geekdom had been set in a small yet important role, the question of whether he could pull off the Norse god turned Marvel superhero. In a lot of actor's hands this would have been a one note character bereft of emotion and humor. Hemsworth is a magnetic leading man, though, exuding charisma and confidence. His poise commands respect, and he effortlessly flows from emotion to emotion, arrogance to humility, with a comedic timing that leaves the audience in stitches but still doesn't undermine his character.    As with most, if not all comic book movies, this movie tries hard to give you a lot of plot in a short two hour span (I say short because it leaves you wanting more, the way a good action movie should). Naturally, some things are a little undercooked but don't ruin the movie. In the end, as much as I fell in love with Natalie Portman's character (as I do with almost any character she plays) the romantic connection between Thor and Foster didn't ring true because for most of the film he seemed somewhat disinterested only to find his infatuation with her later in the movie. Thor's progression from arrogant strongman to humble hero also seems to be slightly haphazard as it really feels as though it could have used more time to flesh out. Hemsworth does an admirable job making the audience feel each twist and turn of the character, but each twist and turn feels a little too abrupt to be genuine.    All in all though, this was an excellent film: a piece of escapist entertainment that embraces Shakespeare as much as it embraces modern blockbuster pop-art. On the scales of Marvel I'd rate this just slightly under Iron Man and far above Iron Man 2 and The Incredible Hulk. The fact that they were able to get Thor right gives me hope for The First Avenger: Captain America and The Avengers. If you're a fan of comicbook movies, Iron Man, or Marvel I highly recommend that you give this film a try. Not to mention, this is quite possibly the best use of 3D I recall since Avatar.

031603441X|1.0|There is only one word for this book and it is boring!!  I can't believe that a person as colorful as Keith Richards could write such a dull book.
B002ZCY7SW|4.0|24 maintains the same quality and suspense through all 8 seasons.  Season 8 does not disappoint as Jack Bauer and Chloe O'Brian once again battle Middle Eastern terrorists by Russian agents.  I reserve the 5th star simply because there were a couple of 24 seasons I liked better, but the entire series is great including Season 8.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The Hunger Games second installment is just as good as the first.  The book is non-stop action on an emotional roller-coaster that doesn't give the reader time to breathe as Catniss gets thrown right back in the fire and it is impossible to know what to expect, who to trust and what is really going on in the different Districts.  If you loved the Hunger Games, you will love Catching Fire.  Suzanne Collins is a genius!  Great, great, great!
B004LWZW42|5.0|This movie was amazing. Charles Xavier and Magneto were fantastically developed in this story. Many action films are just a bunch of special effects, but what makes a movie truly succeed is when the story has some heart, when you care about the characters that are growing and changing in the story. The script itself was also impressive. There were many lines that were expertly echoed in the movie such as \\"mutant and proud\\" and \\"just taking orders.\\"<br /><br />I would have loved to see more going on with some of the minor characters like Havok, but hey, how much can you fit into one movie?
0312323859|4.0|Something Blue by Emily Giffin is such a great, moving, and enjoyable book. I didn't want the book to end! I just loved the characters in the novel. I never thought a novel would actually motivate me to accomplish what I should accomplish(cleaning my room) but it did! I'm giving it four stars because I wished she made the ending of the book a little differently... but if your looking for a good, enjoyable read, this is the book for you.<br /><br />WHEN IS EMILY GIFFIN GOING TO WRITE A NOVEL ON RACHEL'S PERSPECTIVE DURING THIS WHOLE ORDEAL!!!
B004LROMSY|1.0|Where to start...    This show has horrible acting (with the exception of Eva Green), poor script writing and the character Arthur is horribly miscast.  This series is a horrible adaptation of a great story.     I watched the entire season hoping it would somehow recover but unfortunately it only got worse.  Many of the scenes are so bad they become actually comical.  Not even worthy of 1 star.
B004K4AUZW|5.0|HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT....IT ROCKS VERY ENTERTAINING..  LADY GAGA IS THE BOMB.....ELECTRIC CHAPEL AND HEAVY METAL LOVER AND BORN THIS WAY IS MY FAVES FOR NOW ----EDITED EDITED EDITED
B001UV4XI8|5.0|Since this movie only came in a multi type pack, i bought it for the dvd. I don't have blu-ray any time soon.  It arrived on time and it excellent condition. I give you 5 stars.
092389165X|4.0|A week before the bomb is dropped until 40 years later, Hersey tells the story of the human impact through 6 bomb-impacted Japanese.  We learn that \\"survivor\\" is too boastful a term in Japanese culture.  The 1946 classic is updated with the lige stories of the 6 individuals.    Looking back, the reporting seems remarkably balanced, objective, insightful and unjudging.  The negative US response at the time makes sense in light of the war and its casualties.  The ongoing negative response portraying this as an apologetic work is harder to understand.  Morally justified or not, the bomb had a devastating, unexpected and long-lasting negative impact on a city, a country, a second country, a culture and the world.      Hersey's description of the impact is stomach twisting without being gratuitously graphic.  His picture of a stoic, orderly, accepting and recovering culture is inspiring, but not over done.  This book does not replace a trip to Hiroshima and a visit to the museum and gardens, but it does make the hair stand up on your neck a few times.  War, culture and ethical decisions are complex.  Best to understand them as deeply as possible.
B004DESQBE|4.0|As much as I like Ya Ya's better than this one you can not deny the quality of this recording. The intro spins right into a totally awesome version of Honky Tonk Women into the medley of If You can't Rock Me/Get off My Cloud and it is excellent. Hot Stuff and Happy are really hot tracks and Star Star rocks out. Side two of this LP is by far not the Stones best live work. As great a song as Tumbling Dice is the 10-17-1973 version at Foret Nationale in Brussels is far superior. Fingerprint file is a novelty here, not very well recorded. You got to move is an interesting song to put this LP but to me is not inspiring. Finally on side 2 You Can't Always Get What You Want, is boring although that is an extremely tough song to do live because of the length of it. Now, Side 3 of this LP is FANTASTIC! I happen to have the soundboard recording of the El Macambo 1977 shows and it rocked. Keith had been busted and the band was in turmoil but they played solid and hard there and it shows on this LP. Side 4 of this LP is great but not their best. It's Only Rock N Roll is great but the 1995 Live version from St Louis is much better. I give them props for Brown Sugar is a great rendition of a great song. Jumpin Jack Flash is old and tired here with the best version I have ever heard of the song again comes from 10-17-1973 Brussels Affair and is in the middle of the ROCKIN medley of, \\"Rip This Joint/Jumpin Jack Flash/Street Fightin Man. Last on side 4 is Sympathy For the Devil and it it well recorded. To me the best version is the raw version at Hampton Roads Virginia 1981 but this one is good.<br /><br />Finally,even though I think this is not the best Live Stones LP I do highly recommend it to the casual Stones Fan as a starting point of looking into the Stones works out on the road. I bought it when it was first released and still have the copy of it. It's is well worth the price.
B003Y5H51K|2.0|Negatives:   I've seen more interesting caves in the Western US.  Not claustrophobic - at all.   Story was a bit of a long stretch.   Acting was too over-the-top and unbelievable.   Cinematography was minimal predictable and uninspiring.   Set prop rocks and cave were not that real.     Positive (thus two stars):  Nice aerial shot of Cave of Swallows hole.    (P.S. Film supposed location is a composite of many places and props.)
0307716511|1.0|Ideally, a murder mystery has an interesting and plausible crime, convincing red herrings, detective work that makes sense and solves the puzzles, and characters whom one has some affection for.  It's very hard to reach that ideal.  Many murder mysteries manage at most one of those characteristics.  Writers often compensate for the lacks in their books by creating s special, slightly unrealistic world.  Readers are then willing to accept implausibilities and cardboard characters.  If someone attempts a realistic setting, it ups the stakes.  Everything needs to make sense and the characters need to be engaging.  The present mystery has a realistic setting and can't pull it off.  The book is way too long.  The crime is interesting but implausible in the extreme.  The red herrings are unconvincing and, worse, boring.  The characters are hastily drawn and largely cliches.  The dead sister is over-idealized.  Only the narrator's mother has some stature as a character.  The narrator's development from a cold, contained person to a  caring and affectionate one is not believable.  Although the author gives the narrator the thoughts and emotions of grief, it's as if they were copied from an article about grief.  It's writing by the numbers.  But, hey, you do learn a little about cystic fibrosis.

B003BW0CB6|3.0|I've recently discovered Michael Connelly and enjoyed his works, beginning with \\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\".  That book, and \\"The Brass Verdict\\" were completely enjoyable mixes of legal procedural and mystery.  Perhaps that is what makes this latest effort so disappointing.  The reader is left with the feeling that somebody must have torn out the last few chapters, or that the author simply got tired of writing and shut down the story.  There is no dramatic climax, no denouement.  Very disappointing work by a very able author.  I had planned to read all the Mickey Haller stories.  Not sure the rest will be worth the $$ now.      I enjoyed getting to know Haller's first ex-wife, Maggie McPherson, a little better as she sits second-chair in the only case where Haller has ever acted as prosecutor.  Still, her character could be developed more.  Hidden depths to that woman, I believe.  Haller's half-brother and investigator, Harry Bosch, is too one-dimensional for my taste, but could also be developed more.  The story, and the characters, would have benefited from a great deal more effort.  I believe Connelly is capable of it, but either bowed to a deadline or just got bored with the project.  Too bad.
1878424777|5.0|Excellent CD.  Peter Coyote is a great reader.  The concepts in this book are unbelievable.  I am trying to adhere to the agreements - a little hard in reality, but possible - and am finding true heaven at times.  I still want to slip back to my old beliefs and this is when the bliss ends.  RE-listening to the CD again and again really reinforces the concepts.  People wonder why I am so calm and relaxed now - at least more than I was before this CD entered my life.  I share the CD and it's principals but find many people are content with their torturous lives - sad.Maybe they are afraid - I shouldn't make assumptions.....
B0043WDK3A|5.0|This show just keeps getting better and better.  The relationship between the two leads, Beckett and Castle, ist so raw and tense, very reminicent of Mulder and Scully.  If you haven't done so yet, You must check out this show, however you must start from the beginning in order to keep up with the character development.  It's very much worth catching up on this one.  That's what we're doing now, I'm going back and re-watching season's one and two so my wife can catch up, we both love it more every episode, and its even better the second time through :)
B004IQMXD4|5.0|Miss Stevie has done it again.  I don't think this will be a chart topeer, but it will be a great addition to those libraries filled with Stevie's works.  I especially found the last two songs on the album to be the best.  \\"Cheaper Than Free\\" brings tears to my eyes.  This songstress can do no bad in my eyes and I think this album shows a little more of her depth.  I just found the little 'flip show' in the bottom right hand corner of each linear note - a little bonus!
B000ERU6QC|5.0|REPLAY, replay, replay, REPLAY, IT'S THAT GOOD. Music to get dressed to, to drive to work to, to rock out to.
1442337966|5.0|Sounds silly that a CD could change your life, but it has mine.  I am a professional that has been in management all of my life.  Since incorporating this new thought process, my coworkers have completely changed - all because of my newfound realizations that this CD has awakened.  The concepts and thoughts are so simple and yet profound.  Now, there is a little effort that must go into utilizing it - like the work needed to make \\"The Secret\\" effective - but you will see your life actually transform.  I highly recommend \\"The Four Agreements\\" to be the follow-up to this CD.  They seem to fit so well together.....
B000002KET|5.0|Back in the day, you couldn't pay a good Haitian-American Christian child like myself to listen to a BLACK SABBATH album. The album cover art has to be the scariest,and conceptually most evil for it's time! Later on, I started listening to cats like:AC/DC,HENDRIX,ZEPPELIN,FUNKADELIC, and THE DOORS, so it made it a little easier for me to pick up a BLACK SABBATH album(My kid brother and his homies also played a role). This is definitely one the baddest rock albums in recorded history! Ozzy,Tony and the rest of the cats, really give it up on this record. The music is: rockin',melodic,funky, and passionate yet grimy. My favorite tracks are:\\"sabbath bloody sabbath\\",\\"a national acrobat\\",\\"killing yourself to live\\", and \\"looking for today\\". All of the songs on this classic album are great however. The music on this album are timeless, and will always ROCK,for an eternity! Tony Iommi, performs some of the baddest,funky guitar riffs and solo's, I've ever heard! Geezer on Bass,and Bill on drums, are also a rockin' tight unit. This album is essential listening for all rock fans period!
0767827791|1.0|I am a lover of film, and at age 50, I am in an interesting place right now in terms of appreciating the evolution of film as a medium. But I honestly cannot understand why this film is so beloved.    I thought surely it was meant as a lampoon until I did a little research [I was looking up Holden's age--and boy was I shocked; at 37 he looks 57, so old that his scenes with Millie are creepy/pedophile-ish], and found that it is both respected and loved by the majority of viewers at most film sites. My question is why? It distractingly overacted. The premise is ridiculous. The dialogue is so awful, it skirts satire. \\"Streetcar Named Desire\\" had been released two years prior and it addresses the same issues of sexuality without falling into farce. The Novak/Holden dance sequence had my husband rolling with laughter and me completely mystified as to the intent of the film.    My advice: rent it before you buy it.     Serious film lovers--please fill me in on what I am obviously missing.
B003Y5H51K|1.0|This movie was so bad, I'm swearing off James Cameron films.    There was a whole Star Trek element to this, where the people in the red shirts are the ones who died. Pretty stupid that.    The father - son relationship was not at all believable.    The Xanadu quote throughout the movie was very tired.    The movie failed to emphasize the one that thtese teams really have and that is a very team work bond. In this movie, the team was a group of egotistical millionaires, who thought to hell with their team.    The directing was bad. The writing was bad.    I'm done.
B003LD9P4K|4.0|I have been a serious ELP listener since I bought their first LP, and have purchased several DVD's of their performances from the 70's, only to be disappointed by the abysmal sound and video quality.  So I was glad to see that a stage performance was available in Blu-ray and 5.1 surround.  I was  also happy to read mostly glowing reviews of the disc on the Amazon site.  So I bit, and now have my own review to offer.<br /><br />I agree with most other reviewers that this disc was better than expected, but not all that you would like it to be either.  My personal take in this disc: Performance=4, Picture=4, Sound=3.<br /><br />I feel that considering their age (and mine), ELP gave a fine show.  Energy and musicianship is about as good as you can expect.  The disc showcases some of the best material of their career, especially those from ELP(first), Tarkus, Trilogy, Pictures, and BSS.  However I have a hard time appreciating the selections from the later, and justly unsuccessful, LPs after BSS.<br /><br />On the production quality side, this is certainly not the \\"technical audio and video gem\\" opined by another reviewer. It is a Montreux Jazz Festival Production, with post at their own facilities.<br /><br />I checked with other web reviews of the disc to confirm my conclusions about audio quality, which are:<br />- Greg Lake's vocals are pretty badly buried in the mix, not center channel as you would expect, but disembodied in the L, R, and surrounds. Thankfully his guitars are well presented, especially the acoustic.<br />- Keith's keyboards are well recorded and mixed. No complaints except: why didn't he use his original Moog more than he did?<br />- Carl's drums are \\"all there\\", but not up front in the mix like they should be in a power-trio.  The snare and kick come through alright, but high-hat and cymbals are weak.  The drum mix just does not have the impact it should.<br />- I'd be willing to bet that this was remixed from stereo to 5.1; that would explain some of the above weaknesses.  The DVD format was new in 1995, and 5.1 mixes did not show up on it until 1997.  The original production from 1997 might have been mixed to stereo only, and the original multi-tracks not used for remixing when the DVD was finally produced in 2004.<br /><br />The quality of the video is good, but not great as Blu-rays go. It is 1080i rather than the preferred 1080p. According to the credits, it was \\"recorded in HI Definition\\", and downconverted.  This implies the early Sony HD1280(?) system was used.  I saw no evidence of film grain or motion artifacts that would indicate transfer from film.  In general, color and sharpness is good, and the editing did not get in the way of my enjoyment of the performance.  It was thankfully free of MTV-type production frenzy.<br /><br />In summary, if you love ELP, you will like this blu-ray better than the other available performances on disc. Some of those look more like documentaries or even newsreels.as new in 1995, and 5.1 mixes did not show up on it until 1997.

B004SBQAN8|2.0|Though generally a closet fan of teen angst movies, I found \\"I Am Number Four\\" to be one of those that tried really hard but lacked the finesse in execution of the Twilight or X-Men adolescent portrayals.  Perhaps it was the lack of depth by the leads' performances or maybe it was the fact that they were upstaged in every scene by the \\"bad\\" aliens.  Actually, the beagle gained more of my sympathy than the \\"heroes\\".  Action scenes did not disappoint, though, and were lively punctuations to an otherwise very average movie.  Even fans of Timothy Olyphant will see too little of his sexy lethality to justify sitting through the rest.  The sad part was that the premise and storyline promised to be intriquing and full of potential; the movie just never quite got there.  Movies that doesn't pretend to be significant (and those of us who see lots and lots of movies have experienced plenty of these) can be satisfying to watch in their own way.  A movie that sets itself up as something more significant and isn't, lies to the audience and creates frustration because we expected something more.  If you need to kill an afternoon, go drag out the older flick, \\"The Faculty\\" for a much better ride.

0061452068|4.0|Ridley is more eloquent than Julian Simon, but like Simon he seems like a lawyer focusing all the reader's attention on the evidence most favorable to his conclusions rather than an objective scientist.<br /><br />A lot of what he says is right, but I'm bothered by the frequency with which he exaggerates. E.g. he says \\"justice has improved\\" [since the 1950s] because 234 innocent Americans were freed due to DNA evidence. That seems like such a tiny fraction of the total injustices that's it's nearly useless - it's easy to imagine that declining jury quality has overwhelmed the improvements.<br /><br />The book has a bit more history than I wanted, much of it devoted to the idea that free trade is an important cause of progress. He has an interesting claim that trade an important factor in pre-agricultural human success - it reportedly was virtually nonexistent in other species (even Neanderthals), and it may have started around the time that human population began to grow significantly. But the industrial revolution has been discussed often enough elsewhere that I got little out of his summary of the causes.<br /><br />I'm disappointed that he presented trends of slowing population growth as reasons for optimism. There are many ways those trends could change, such as evolution or cheaper ways reproducing. And there are good arguments that more population growth would be desirable at least for this century.
0061134007|4.0|I do not consider myself a mystery or thriller novel reader, but after reading Stieg Larson I found myself more drawn towards those types of novels. I was pleasantly surprised that while this novel has a mystery of sorts at the center of its story, it is much more than just thrilling or suspicious. Nesbo spends time building the characters and the relationships so that the struggles and triumphs of Harry Hole become personal, and you feel betrayed or disgusted or frustrated by the pit falls of other characters and even some of the villains, like Sverre Olson or the man who Harry searches for throughout the entire novel (I won't spoil it by naming names).     Nesbo makes you want to feel the story and I found myself vicariously involved in the investigation and re-reading several pages and passages in order to make sure I didn't miss anything. While the twists and turns can be awfully confusing, Nesbo wraps the story to shed light on the several mysteries at the end. Not being one myself, I don't know if I could recommend this to an avid mystery novel reader, as it does a lot more than just solve a crime, and does not have the same fast thrilling pace as some novels might. However, I thoroughly enjoyed the somewhat slower pace and only give it 4 stars as I am not sure if it will be loved by all. A 4.5 is a probably more accurate rating.
0756405890|3.0|I've read all the first book and am wading through the second (I bought both at once because of all the hype and a recommendation). The slow pacing of the book just sucks the life out of the adventure, I think. The details of everyday life, worrying about money, avoiding or getting into trouble, mooning over a girl...they're realistic in that they just keep happening, just like in real life. But does that make for a great tale? It did in Harry Potter, but there was a ton going on and even the details were clever, amusing, scary, charming. Kvothe's close friends are sketchy, I don't really have a handle on them. He has a quest but it's not really moving along. There is humor, but not charm. My big complaint is that Kvothe's pattern is the same: be an idiot, bad things happen. Be an idiot again, bad things happen again. He toddles around with the self-centered insensitivity of a three-year-old, it's all about him and he has no idea of the consequences of his actions. So multiple chapters end up with a version of, \\"I thought I was clever and had won; but I was a fool and something bad happened later.\\" Anyway, my point is: you can write a good book, but sometimes it takes an editor to make a great book. I think these books could have been edited down big time and maybe then watching a talented idjit evolve into a hero wouldn't feel like waiting for paint to dry.
B003Y5H4SO|5.0|This is an above average movie made by M. Night Shyamalan. This was a brand new type of horror movie for me. It is based in the City of Philadelphia. It begins with a person committing suicide by leaping off a building. The action then moves to an office building. There are five people whi get onto an elevator. The elevator then stalls in mid flight. Then strange things begin occuring. One by one the elevator riders figure that one of their fellow riders is actually Satan. An investigator played by Chris Messina start coming up with the backgrounds of the occupants of the stalled. Each one of them has earned an appointment with  Satan.  All efforts to get the elevator moving fall short. The elevator riders start dying one by one. The police cannot rescue them. The movie has a stunning ending. The identity of Satan among the elevator passengers is shocking. Be sure to see this movie.
0071624058|2.0|Beware and check the CD carefully within the refund period.  The CD that came with the book I bought is defective.  On the Listening Section of the Authentic Practice Tests, you are forced to listen to the passage twice (when on the test you can only hear it once) because the button that should say \\"Questions\\" says \\"Continue.\\"  After you hear the passage once, you have no other option but to click on \\"Continue,\\" which plays the entire passage all over again.  After the second hearing, the button \\"Questions\\" comes and you can proceed.  But this does NOT simulate the real test.  This is not just in one of the listenings in just one practice test.  It is in MOST of the listenings in BOTH practice tests.  I cannot return the book.  I am teaching in Africa now.  Very disappointed.  I think the ETS, which determines the fate of so many foreign students with its tests, should have better quality control!
B004132HZS|5.0|The BBC has produced an upbeat and updated Sherlock Holmes.  Acting, direction, and general production is typical of the BBC when they get it right.  I cannot wait for the continuing series.  I wanted to give my five star rating here.
0553582038|3.0|There are reviews much more detailed and better worded than mine, so I will keep it brief. I DO NOT CARE about ALL the names of ALL the houses and their standards and sigils and the colors they wear, especially when it adds absolutely nothing to moving the plot forward, yet Martin seems to think I need two full paragraphs each time there is a gathering of people just to describe them all. I agree with all of those who say this and Dance of Dragons should have been edited back down to one book. The descriptions are colorful, but again do not lend themselves to setting mood or advancing plot, as the reader becomes mired in the useless details that mean nothing at all, and seem to be the author merely entertaining his own mental image of the place and trying to convey it at length. The dialogues and thoughts of minor characters are trite, uninteresting, and repetitive. I was loathe to do it, but about the middle of the book I've found myself skipping over paragraphs, and may do as the one reviewer Tom suggested and skip the whole chapters relating to Brienne and other minor, uninteresting characters. They do not move the plot forward, and play no great role. Where are his editors! I'm still going to purchase the next book though, but will be choosing my chapters carefully.
B004GJYR7I|1.0|I've tried.  Honestly, I have.  I've watched this film at least three, possibly four, times over a number of years, in hopes of having some sort of epiphany regarding its merits.  Sorry, folks, but to me, Bringing Up Baby is one of the least funny so-called \\"screwball\\" comedies it has ever been my misfortune to see.  Cary Grant has a few mildly amusing moments, but Katharine Hepburn's character is simply excruciatingly unfunny.  And she's so shrill most of the time!  I didn't crack even a smile at any of her antics.  Tonight, I was bored to the point that I actually fell asleep while I was watching.  I usually like Cary Grant films, and I love most of Katharine Hepburn's work, but this is one film that I will not be adding to my collection.  I don't want to waste the shelf space.
B0034G4ORC|5.0|As a Marine who loves watching hollywood films specifically for technical screw ups, this movie is what Hurtlocker wishes it could be, a technically accurate portrayal of modern military combat operations, that those operations happen to be against aliens is of no consequence. Outside of like I said some truly minor stuff like Michelle Rodriguez's M-16A4 becoming a M-4A1 carbine and back again every few scenes, a type of Huey that hasn't been in active service since vietnam, and getting a lock on tone from an AT-4 rocket launcher right at the end, and as echoed by all my buddies \\"those Marines don't swear enough\\". They nailed it and they nailed us, Eckhard played a kick ass lead and the rest of the cast was spot on.     Put it to you this way, it was good enough that when I left the theater with my at the time girlfriend before I could even open my mouth to say anything she said \\"Don't you dare reenlist\\". I think that says it all right there.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This series was INCREDIBLE!!  I couldn't stand to put it down. It has a little bit of everything for every type of reader;  suspense, love, mystery, imagination, adventure.  And because it is about a period of time that seems unreal, it just makes it better to take yourself into another place and time, yet still be able to understand the that world.  Probably the most riveting book I have read in years. I've recommended it to everyone I know.

B005342N58|3.0|One of the great things about the Arctic Monkeys is their ability to both musically and lyrically create hooks that stick in your brain.  Having given Suck It and See several listens, I sit here a few days after my last listen and can't recall any of it.  Not a lyric, not a lick, not a rhythm.      The band has always excelled at creating their own unique space in the musical scene, but with this release, it's just generic alt rock.  There is nothing bad or annoying here, it's an alright set of tunes for background listening, but nothing more.
B001AQO3WY|5.0|First off let me say that if you have not read Generation Kill and Band of Brothers then you need to quit reading this review and get these books and read them.  Then watch the movies.  Both books are excellent (and both mini series are excellent too).  Generation Kill does an excellent job of capturing the environment of the Iraq confrontation.  The cast is perfect.  Band of Brothers suffered from a few miss casts like David Schwimmer.  I highly recommend this mini-series.
0439023513|5.0|What an amazing series! Like everyone else, I stayed up late reading it, dreamt about it while I slept, ignored food and water until I finished. A great roller coaster ride!    However, I also felt the same way the negative reviewers did: angry, sad, empty. In the first two books, Katniss was fighting an external war, the war with the Capitol, where we see adventure, excitement, hope, and best of all, love.  In book three, it ends with an internal war, her demons. And it's her demons we don't want to see. It's what we don't expect to see. We  expected a satisfying ending, where all our beloved characters are saved from the rubble, unscathed, or almost unscathed (but treatable, yay!). A happy ending results and we all close the book feeling good.     But war is not suppose to be pretty.       As a country, we are anesthisized by war since we have not experience warfare in our own country. We often see violence in video games, television, movies, and we always expect triumph and glory while ignoring its reality.  We only see it on CNN, but never here.  I think Collins' last book in the series jolted us back to reality.  And in the age of gratuitous violence and sex, I think Collins gives us an important lesson that we all must learn and accept. That real war is not a game. That real lives are affected by it. That real consequences, like it or not, do follow.  As Katniss tries to move on in book three, so should we.     It's ugly, but it's the truth.
B00003CWNR|3.0|I suspect the David Copperfield (significantly a bed time read in the orphanage) 'growth of a soul' of the novel will convince in a better way and you can't get away from the intention to tug heartstrings in a Dickensian fashion with various scenes of people slipping away and children all pretty undamaged despite their emotional traumas. Toby MacGuire is well-cast as Toby MacGuire and Caine is good as are the supports. The music gives the intention away, I think with its insistent 'this is a sentimental moment' artiness. It's a weepie really and well-done of its type but are the Cider House Rules really 'what it's about'?

030758660X|5.0|This book is unexpectedly beguiling. The write-ups for each pattern are fun. It's hard to resist an introduction that begins, \\"There is no better protection from blood-thirsty vampires than this plush, hooded cowl which encircles your delicate and appetizing human neck with warm woolen cables...\\" Or, \\"Vampires don't have to worry about wrinkles, since they never age physically, but a vampire will want to develop her or his own sense of style. What do modern vampires wear? Tuxedos? Black capes?...\\"<br /><br />And the patterns themselves? Love them. I was surprised at how much I loved them, starting with the \\"Tourniquet Scarf\\" which mimics the look of a nasty neck wound in a surprisingly tasteful fashion. There are wraps, sweaters, gloves, shawls, blankets, pulse-protectors (warmers), socks ... Most of them are directed at women, but there are some patterns for men and children, as well. As well as non-clothing items like the blood-type bottle-cozies to \\"keep your blood at 98.6 degrees.\\" Or the \\"Got Blood\\" pillow. Let's not forget the werewolf designs, too. It's not all about vampires, after all, and the paw-print fingerless gloves and the hat with ears are adorable.<br /><br />I actually rather love this book. The patterns are wonderful. They're creative but also GOOD. They're not as, well, cheesy as I had been afraid of. The pictures are atmospheric but illustrative. And all in all, what first appears to be a gimmicky book geared to capitalizing on a current trend is actually a useful collection of practical patterns.<br /><br />So, yes, the trend will eventually (?) fade. In a few years, the descriptions might be dated. (\\"Oh, was there a vampire movie called Twilight? I think I remember that.\\") But the patterns themselves? Charming. There's a sense of creative freedom at work here that's as bewitching as the modern-day vampire seems to be. Which, after all, is the point.
B002NUZ93S|4.0|This album is just great. If you like psychedelic music then this is a must album and i highly recommended to all of you.

0802798225|4.0|On the surface, this teen romance novel screams cliche--perfect blond cheerleader meets boy from the wrong side of the tracks and they fall in love.  But Perfect Chemistry is so much more than that.  Its realistic characters, serious social issues and conversational writing style turn this tale from a stereotype to a gripping read.<br /><br />Alex Fuentes is a member of the Latino Blood gang.  While he accepted that he had to join to save his family the the gang's persecution, there remains a spark in his heart that longs for a better future for himself.  Brittany is the cool and controlled popular girl.  She works hard to create a perfect image at school in order to hide the dysfunction of her home life.  Naturally, the two hate each other.  But when their chemistry teacher assigns them as lab partners for whole senior year, the pair are forced to work together.<br /><br />While at it's heart, Perfect Chemistry is a love story, the growth of these characters really takes center stage in the plot.  Simone Elkeles doesn't shy away from the grittier aspects of gang life, nor does she attempt to white-wash the characters as perfect kids in bad situations.  They are flawed and damaged and struggling to make their way in the world.  Alex carries a gun, gets high and frequently gets in trouble.  Brittany can be snobbish and cold.  But the two have similarities as well.  Both are protective of their siblings; Alex in order to keep his brothers out of the gang, and Brittany to keep her handicapped sister out of a home.  They both want a better life for themselves, one that means escaping the molds they were born into.<br /><br />The only thing I really didn't like about this book was the epilogue.  I wish Elkeles would have left it off completely.  It added a level of cheesiness that wasn't present anywhere else in the book.  Readers might want to skip this part to keep it from ruining their perceptions of the book.<br /><br />Overall, I give Perfect Chemistry...<br /><br />Plot - 4 bookmarks<br />Character Development - 4 1/2 bookmarks<br />Realism - 5 bookmarks (Love books where teens behave like teens and not as the politically correct police want them to.)<br />Love Story - 4 bookmarks<br />Dream Cast (otherwise known as who I pictured while reading) -  Alyson Michalka (Brittany), Ed Speelers (Colin), Roberto Urbina (Alex)pment - 4 1/2 bookmarks  Realism - 5 bookmarks (Love books where teens behave like teens and not as the politically correct police want them to.)

McCartney II is one of those albums that you feel McCartney was contractually obligated to undertake or I guess the music executives were too intimidated to say no to Sir Paul - but who am I to complain??......McCartney and his Beatle comrades did more for my happiness than most in this world....it's just that they set the standard so high that when one hears things like this........well what can I say?
