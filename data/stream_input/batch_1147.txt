B004SGWYVA|4.0|I gotta say I really enjoyed this anime which surprises me because I hate zombies and zombie horror stuff. Luckily the chicks are extremely hot. And the Music is awesome. The Sexy ladies manage to keep it light hearted and fun amid a rather predictable much to dark zombie apocalypse plot.      To all the haters get a life! Boobs are great :D
B004YZJ7M4|5.0|One of, if not the best episode to date in the series. Action, humor, wit, tech, drama, art, adventure, and oh yea, even a little bit of heart.
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|If you had told me that the Foo Fighters would be one of my favorite bands back when they released that crappy song with the Mentos commercial video (I've blocked the name of the song from my memory, I still can't stand it!), I would have told you \\"You're completely insane!\\".  Now, after some growth as a person and music lover, I've found that the Foo Fighters are an incredibly talented band and I'm very thankful for their music. Wasting Light is possibly one of the best CDs I've ever heard.  That's really saying something when you consider that I've been a music lover for 30+ years and I can't even pick a favorite band, let alone a favorite CD!  But Dave and the boys have really outdone themselves on this one.  Between the hard driving rockers and the lyrics of the thoughtful ballads (and I use that term very loosely...sort of a class outside of your typical ballad), I thought I had died and gone to heaven when I first heard this CD. BUY THIS CD! You won't be disappointed.
B000H7JD4K|5.0|WOW. Words can't describe how I felt when I first heard this album. Everything is utterly great, the guitars,vocals,lyrics and my god the drums! This album is completley consistent with no fillers what so ever. Can't say the same for NOTB (looking at you gangland!). And the general feel of the songs is amazing. With a song like \\"The longest day\\" feeling dark and moody and then a song like \\"out of the shadows\\" feeling almost magical. Just buy this friggin album now! Its better than all of the 90's stuff easy, and competes with all the classic albums.
B003FXXNH6|2.0|I actually ran across this movie at Best Buy for only $5. I now know why it was only $5. The movie was horrible and lacked substance. It was shot in a Russian Prison in which all the prisoners were bet on and used as fighters and in the process promised freedom. Instead if you lost then they killed you and if you won they kept betting on you. The film was very low budget. All they did in the movie was fight and do hard time in this Russian prison. The two main characters (shown on the cover) eventually devise an escape plan and with some outside help they are able to break out and become rich in the process. Don't waste your money. Unlike the 2 sequels before, there are no known actors in the movies everyone is a new comer and every one needs to go back to acting school.
B004HD2ZK4|5.0|What can I say about Trail of Dead that would do them justice? This disc is fantastic!!  They decided to produce it as 2 long tracks mixed together, (think of side B of The Beatles' \\"Abbey Road\\") and it works!  Their last 2 discs were good, but were lacking a certain something from their masterpiece \\"Worlds Apart\\", this album has them on top of their game.  I bought the deluxe edition which has a 2nd disc of the songs individually, and they may even be different versions.  I've only listened to it once, it was cool, but I preferred the total experience of the first disc.  Conrad's artwork is amazing again, and if you ever get the chance to see them live (which I did for the 4th time last night) you MUST check them out.  They are freakin' amazing.

B004G600A4|4.0|When there is so much trash out there, it's always good to have no buyer's remorse.  Not only I'm I glad I watched it, I'm glad I own it on DVD.    I can't say it's a \\"must\\" since no single song really impressed me as a break away hit, but they were all O.K.  The animation and the story were excellent - no obvious stupidity or plot holes (unless you dislike hyper intelligence in a horse, but this is a fairytale).  This was a thoroughly enjoyable film for the family and better than most and I'd recommend buying it.
B000001GS4|1.0|I compare this recording to my Mel Gibson Hamlet video.  I am glad I have both Gibson and Agerich, just to know where the low end of the meter is. Gibson's reading of Hamlet is ... well ... bizarre, the low end of a scale topped by Sir Laurence Olivier and Kenneth Branagh.  Bizarre is perhaps the kindest thing one can say about this \\"interpretation.\\" Richter.  Cliburn. Bronfman (whom I heard live tonight, a concert that confirmed my judgement).  Not Agerich.... I don't understand the cult around her.  Proof of \\"De gustibus non est disputandum.\\"
0545091020|5.0|I've only just started listening to The Hunger Games and I'm enjoying it. The setting is intriging and I've been drawn into the story very quickly. The narrator is excellent. I'd recommend this cd book to anybody who enjoys a good 'read'. The positive reviews I read on this site were completely accurate.
B003O6W30C|5.0|I've never been a Hanson fan and when I saw they had a new album I was surprised to see that they were still around! I decided to finally check it out, and I am amazed! This album is honestly the first album in a LONG time that I have fallen in love with after just ONE LISTEN! I would suggest this album to anyone who just likes good music. There are fun songs as well as emotional songs.  It's just all an all around great album and I am VERY happy that I bought it!  Not one song that I don't love!

B004FJJGBG|5.0|Avatar is based on a theme that is overused in many films today, but the 3D experience, cinematography, and computer-generated effects make this a must-own for your home theater.    The Blu-ray 3D transfer of Avatar \\"delivers a mesmerizing 1080p experience that's about as close to perfection as any high def 3D release is likely to come for quite some time.\\" The 3D image \\"is simply stunning in how seamless it truly is; every moment practically transports viewers to Pandora.\\" Depth, detail and color also excellent. Ghosting, the bane of many 3D discs is only slightly and sporadically noticeable.
B003ZWTGKU|4.0|Saw this on Arte and agree that the weird camera angles destroy the dramatic tension at key moments. The person editing apparently does not realize that when the hero is singing, the camera should show him, not a reaction shot of the heroine that obscures his face, and not the orchestra playing. I can't see any point in showing the actors off stage before they get into their parts, either. Breaking the fourth wall is simply a mistake. I've disliked the Met's HD camera work, but this is actually far worse. It's ironic that when for once the two leads are very photogenic, the camera doesn't want to take advantage of that.    The singing is beautiful. If Jonas Kaufmann weren't so romantically handsome and perfect visually for the part, I'd say just get the audio on this. But there is great power in his acting to be enjoyed, if one can ignore the stupid camera angles.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|These headphones are by far the best investment I made for my PS3! I can now play the volume cranked and not bother the rest of the family! C'mon guys how many times have you had to \\"Turn that thing down\\" because the Woman was annoyed? Well these baby's solve that problem. I find myself totally involved the the game environment. You will get the feel that you are actually on the battlefield or in my case in the race car.There are others that are \\"5.1 Digital\\" I don't buy it. The price of them are double of what I paid for these.         Strongly recommend these!!
B000002AGN|5.0|I started out with smooth jazz and new age radio formats in my early 20s, but always knew there had to be more.  After hearing several watered down versions of this album's title track, I purchased a copy of this album on cassette, and began a love affair that has lasted for the past 10 years.  To hades with the pretentious one-star reviews or even people who consider this the mother of today's smooth jazz!  After all, even in 1959, it's downright edgy and makes some of Vince Gueraldi's semi-cool stuff look...well, like John Tesh.  Fabulous syncopation, engrossing time signatures, and beautiful melodies are all you need to look for.  For those of us who didn't master an instrument as well as we'd wished, and still have enough sense to know talent when we hear it, this is all one needs.  Perhaps this is the genuine way to enjoy jazz.  It is enough to appreciate it with very little background, a lot of attention, and forget your reservations because you've been overly exposed to somebody else's jaded opinion.  That's what keeps this album fresh for me.  I just plain love it, it appeals to my tastebuds, and if you don't like it, that's as may be.  This music speaks, I like what it's saying, and if \\"Everybody's Jumpin'\\" so am I!  Not one bad cut here, and that's always a far too rare selling point with yours truly.
B004G600A4|5.0|I love this movie. It is very entertaining. My kids watch it over and over. It is quickly becoming one of my favorites.

0756404738|4.0|Rothfuss continues to impress with this second installation. If you were a fan of the first book, you will surely enjoy this one. The only gripe is the waiting period between books. I had given up on the series after years of waiting. By chance stumbled upon the new book and picked it up. Definitely worth it, though a re-read of the first might be in order to make a smooth transition back into Qvothe's world.
0670022411|5.0|This was a very good book. Entertaining.  Held my attention.  I am looking forward to more by this author.
B004LE7PCM|5.0|My cousin's 12 year old daughter gave this to my ten year old son as a gift.  She read these stories when she was ten and loved them.  As a matter of fact, I read them when I was about that age and loved them as well.  But I wasn't too sure about my busy, video-game obsessed, mile a minute action-packed boy, who always seems to gravitate toward action/fantasy series about daring deeds done in strange and beautiful worlds.<br /><br />Turns out, crime and mystery-solving in Victorian London works just fine for him.  He's got months worth of reading here, all available whenever he's got a chance to sit down with it.  And he's starting to enjoy observing and reasoning.  Win-win.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|All you Fan Boys out there need to get something through your thick skulls when it comes to the Original Star Wars Trilogy...This is a Franchise that George Lucas created, therefore he has the right to do what he wants with his films and how he wants to do it! Does George Lucas get to make the call on your personal decisions in life? No he doesn't and you can't control him in his! Now, I know I am about to suffer the Fan Boy Backlash (I'm So Scarred...you wish!) The point is that Lucas is putting together more than you could have imagined together for this Blu-Ray release. These Movies are going to look Fantastic in HD Format, and besides if Lucas Made the decision to Include Restored Versions of the Original Theatrical Releases, he would likely keep it a secret until the set was released. Why spoil a fantastic surprise like that? But if you still have problems go out and find yourselfs a VHS Boxed set of the original Trilogy(A good copy is still available for a price!)and watch that While I enjoy the Blu-Ray release of the Star Wars Saga.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|These are BluRay discs.  They have more than enough capacity to do both original and special edition versions on one disc per film, and in the original widescreen format. Don't be surprised if one day, Lucas decides to release the original theatrical versions on BluRay.  Lucas is known for waiting to release different versions so he can milk his Star Wars franchise to death for every new shinny silver dollar he can rip us off for.<br /><br />I am a major fan of all six movies. My digitally remastered standard DVD copies look great on a BluRay player and HDTV. The upscalling to 1080 lines is fantastic. They almost look like HD, especially during bright sceens with lots of color and details.<br /><br />But since I got the BluRay versions, There is a very noticeable difference.  And I like that they are the special edition versions.  The HD picture is much clearer and defined, and the \\"DTS HD Master Audio in 6.1 surround is breathtaking to say the least.  It is a vast improvement over the old Dolby 5.1 on the DVD's.  Although I am a bit surprised that DTS did not make it a 7.1 surround mix for their HD Master Audio mode.  But all that means is the extended Back surround channels are mono instead of stereo.  It still would have been better in full 7.1 surround though.<br /><br />And now that Lucas has made his billions $$$, he sold his Lucasfilm company to the Disney corporation.  Disney says they will make another Star Wars film.  Come on people!  The series was great but it is finished.  And the announcement that JJ Abrahms is going to direct it, only means it will be a revamped dark version of the original with a completely changed history.  In other words,  JJ will kill this wonderful franchise with special effects and rock music like he did with the newer Star Trek movies.  He will turn it into a long video game for the kiddies.<br /><br />It is over and done.  Let it live on as it is, but don't ruin it by making more.  Let Darth Vader rest in peace.  Disney is a great film company with lots of very talented people.  But they are not George Lucas and another Star Wars movie will not be the same.  Just let it go Disney.

1439163146|2.0|The stories in this book are about rich punks who get wasted and destructive.  It's dark and demented.  I did like the story Tar Baby, and I thought the author's writing was very good.  I think I'd have liked it more if there some redemption to the stories.  I guess it's a good thing James Franco left Palo Alto.  I remember it as a very nice place.  Apparently, it was boring to him.<br /><br />The book reminded me of Perks of Being a Wallflower--on steroids.  It's not a waste to read but hard to get through because of subjects.  I hope James Franco continues to write.  Maybe his life since high school has given him better material.
B00003W8NM|4.0|Not too shabby. After reading some pretty bad reviews about this paticular seller i expected the worst, fortunatley, i recieved exactly what they said i would. Disks were in great condition but some of the original artwork wasnt there (about half). other then that it was a great buy, arrived in about half the time they predicted at a bottom line price, i couln't have bought this movie (fight club) cheaper at a yard sale.                  I am jack's happy consumer.
0061339202|5.0|You should know that the book is long! It has small font size and lots of pages, it is a fairly sophisticated book, however it's not difficult to understand, it just tells you a LOT about people and how we behave. I think it's a must read if you're interested in the topic.
B0041KKYEM|4.0|Natalie Portman's riveting Oscar-winning performance dominates this dark, cheerless film.<br />Skillful direction by Darren Aronofsky deftly draws the viewer into the idyllic world of ballet.  The viewer asks what is real and what isn't.  Is BLACK SWAN entertaining?  Marginally.  Is BLACK SWAN well made?  Definitely.  Vincent Cassel, Barbara Hershey, Mila Kunis and Winona Ryder are excellent but it is Portman's descent into madness that remains etched in your mind.  BLACK SWAN is assuredly a film that makes an impression.

Would have preferred that Griffin had used an aluminum bottom bar instead of plastic which allows some \\"give\\" in the stand that would be better if not there.<br /><br />Still, for the price, it's a good product and aesthetically fits well w/the Apple MacBook Pro it was purchased to be used w/.

1844137872|5.0|This is the fringe. Banksy. Shepard Fairey. Patrick Dougherty. Vik Muniz to name a few are (as I see it) as legitimate as Dali, Picasso, Van Gogh etc. of their time. The simple fact that they are not recognized by the `official' art establishment and academics reinforces their legitimacy. Art dies when you have to take a `class' for it. Just pick up a brush etc. and make beautiful mistakes.

1594744769|3.0|First of all, I'd like to say that I loved the concept behind this book.  Ransom Riggs has taken a slew of vintage photographs and created an interesting story connecting them together.  It's a fantastic concept--the book shows the photos as the story goes on and I found myself wanting to look ahead at the photos throughout the book.<br /><br />So, conceptually and esthetically, the book rocked.<br /><br />The story itself, however... The story felt unbelievable.  It's also a great example of needing to \\"show, don't tell\\" the story. To me, the story read like this guy was talking to me and just telling me what was going on, what happened, what the people said.  I didn't feel involved in the story--my emotions weren't engaged nearly as much as my curiosity was, and then, it wasn't the story that I cared about, but the actual photographs in the book.<br /><br />It reminded me of [[ASIN:B0030EG110 Personal Effects: Dark Art]] by J. C. Hutchins--the writing styles between the two books were extremely familiar.  And while \\"Personal Effects: Dark Art\\" had clues inside the front flaps by way of a drivers licence, photographs, and papers to help bring the story to life, this novel has photographs within its pages, doing something similar.<br /><br />If you liked \\"Personal Effects: Dark Art\\" by Hutchins, you'll love this.  I just wished the author could have made me feel more personally invested in the story itself. :)
0767840135|5.0|Is the best of the best of Cirque du Soliel of the oldest shows the have .The opening is amazing I can wait to buy more of Cirque du Soleil.
B004EPYZQC|3.0|You can't give this movie 5 stars...you just can't. It is far from perfect, also it is cliche'.  Oiled up muscle bound guys looking straight out of the gym, hot ladies in slim bikini's, racial jokes, stereotypes, people walking in slow motion while explosions disperse behind them and they are unaffected in their motivational attitude, impossible survival scenes that would kill you 100% of the time, etc.  BUT...if that stuff is what you are looking for or doesn't bother you, this movie is very enjoyable.  There were parts of this movie as a cynic I was like \\"hey wait a minute\\".  But after my girlfriend was like \\"It's just a movie\\"..\\"just watch it\\"  I sat back in the theater and thought well then to heck with it and it was very enjoyable.  Like an adult cartoon.  Sure characters:  how they got this and that, where they came from, how they knew this or that and how two cars can drag a few ton safe down the road at speeds other than 3 miles an hour suspend you belief a little too much, its still fun to watch.  Lin is a fantastic director.  Not cookie cuttering a movie together that gives you a headache with repetitive violence and zero interesting story (see he horrid Transformers movie).  He splices the scenes together without using the same rehashed pans and cliche shots and sounds that everyone else uses.  Vin Diesel who honestly is a horrible actor...seriously he is just plan awful has about as much personality and as a stapler and his acting consists of looking like he has to go to the bathroom and flexing in a tank top.  But for this movie that is all that is required.  He is as usual the bad boy with a heart of gold that never loses or gets frustrated when things go wrong and people die.  He shows about as much depth as possible when he sinks his head and in one scene seems to be looking at his biceps while he tries to pass gas.  Such vulnerability, its a wonder he never got past these movies.  The Rock Johnson, is the new addition and does the usual dual bad boygenerating a hint of humor with a stone face that has made him likable in any scenario of action or anger.  The Rock has the biggest arms on screen of any of the muscle men in the movie...of course they are oiled up in every shot but its The Rock, who cares.  He also is always sweating, who would have thought a Samoan couldn't take Rio heat.  His character however suffered because he was the more interesting of the angles in the movie but wasn't explored in a manner that would have made this movie a little better.  There is one gap that he is missing from frame for almost 30 something minutes to where you almost forget he is in movie.  Like I said the chicks are hot, the Asian guy eats some kind of bagged item, Luda and Ty make black jokes and impossible things happen which is per order of the movie.  My favorite being how they infiltrated the police station.  After causing a septic problem in the bathroom two good goons pretend to be plumbers and carve a huge part of the cement wall so they can cut into the security mainframe...how did they patch this hole to where it would be undetectable is unknown.  It wasn't even close to the toilets.  Another is the fight between Rock and Vin, busted up faces and bruises vanish as soon as the scene changes to 5 minutes later going down the road in the squad car.  REGENERATION POKEMON!!!  Still I found this movie filmed well and very enjoyable.  It never stalls or drags and never has overkill.  I recommend you get this.

1439190275|2.0|I'm not qualified to critique the research or results. Indeed, most of the people I know who have successfully lost weight and kept it off did indeed use some variant of the Atkins diet. But, the diet presented here is not simple as the book claims.    The rules to follow go on for pages. And you have to count carbs, which is just as complicated as counting calories, especially when a certain number of your carbs must come from the \\"foundation vegetables\\" group (as defined by a list given in the book). The \\"permitted\\" foods lists are long, the book in fact recommends you photocopy them until you learn them by heart. I thought perhaps that's not as bad as a really long \\"forbidden\\" foods list, but if you infer the forbidden foods, that list turns out to be really long as well. The reintroduction of carbohydrate food has several stages, and the recommendation in a given stage is that you reintroduce new foods one at a time to see how they affect you - which of course you must carefully monitor.    If the diet is meant to involve so much less suffering than calorie deprivation, why so many pages on how to keep yourself motivated and deal with the wish to eat the wrong things? Why so much insistence that one must keep a food diary to track all the possible things that might go wrong (such as too little fat, too much protein or indeed too many calories), and have a support buddy to call the moment you get a craving? The \\"success story\\" of a woman who failed at the Atkins diet twice and then finally spent some months educating herself about the Atkins diet before seemingly succeeding on the third try is consistent with all the effort that this seems to involve.    I have done calorie-restriction dieting, and the diet in this book seems much more daunting to me. I have also done a medically mandated allergy/intolerance elimination diet, which involved reintroduction of foods to check for their effects, and the diet in this book seems more daunting to me.    Perhaps the original Atkins diet was simpler, I haven't read the literature and possibly that's what I should look at next. And perhaps if you're going to have a diet that is more flexible (as this one claims to be) then you simply cannot avoid added complexity.    I don't plan to throw the idea of low-carb out the window. In fact I know I don't do well on high carb foods so I plan to explore the whole idea further. And if one is less likely to be hungry on this diet, then that's obviously an enormous gain. But the authors should not claim that the diet/lifestyle they describe is simple.    The other problem I have with this book is that most of the concepts are mentioned in a very repeated fashion and the book could have been much shorter.    Addendum to this review: I've now also read Dr. Atkins' New Diet Revolution, Revised Edition, by Dr Atkins, so I have further comments.    For the most part, New Atkins for a New You is a rehash of Dr Atkins' book. Except Dr Atkins' book has the material organized better. Plus Dr Atkins does a much better job of explaining the technical aspects of ketosis and how the studies he cites are actually related to the claims he makes. One could argue that the newer book references newer studies, but I find that of little value unless the authors actually explain how the studies support the claims they are making, and I don't think they do a good job with that. In addition, Dr Atkins has some information on what to do if you are unusually resistant to weight loss and the normal Atkins regime hasn't done the trick. Also, I personally found Dr Atkins' motivational tips (in comparison to the ones in New Atkins for a New You) for how to stay on track to be much more concrete and applicable, that could be just a personal preference since I'm a techie.    New Atkins for a New You does have one thing that Dr Atkins' book doesn't - descriptions on how to modify the diet if you're a vegetarian or vegan.    If you're not in that category, don't bother with this book, get Dr Atkins' book instead. Yes, it was published 8 years earlier, but the information is better.    If you're pregnant, Dr Atkins goes so far as to say you can do the Lifetime Maintenance phase, but neither book actually gives details. Since Lifetime Maintenance is about maintaining the same weight and pregnancy involves gaining weight, you'd need to translate what Lifetime Maintenance means for your situation, presumably with the help of a doctor.    In any case, the Atkins diet is not simple. There's a lot of thinking and analysis involved. If you have metabolic resistance to weight loss, that may be unavoidable, I don't know.  But I would recommend Dr. Atkins' New Diet Revolution, Revised Edition much more highly than this book.
B0034G4OXQ|3.0|Some occasionally clunky dialogue and awkward moments (what the hell kind of night school cooking class coerces students to participate in flirty/sexy blindfolded tasting exercises?) don't hobble this sprawling, somber mosaic about the work of getting through life while facing both loss and the inevitability of death.     The film reaches high for answers it can't possibly deliver but, still, reach high it does, to satisfying effect. Had I not known this was a Clint Eastwood joint beforehand, I never would've guessed (although the spare guitar recalls the theme from \\"Unforgiven\\"). It can't be a coincidence that he took this subject for what has to be one of his final films.     Cecile de France, as one of the leads, is gorgeous to the point of special effects, and the opening scene -- an astonishing depiction of a tsunami that struck Indonesia in 2004 -- is one of the most moving, most harrowing sequences of the past year, amazingly executed.
B004ZT9QVQ|3.0|The first two episodes of season six (or series six if you go the British route) were some of the strongest most compelling episodes in a very long time.<br /><br />Sadly, episode three was a dud.  The doctor following a distress call to a pirate ship stuck in the doldrum (region of the ocean know for long periods of no wind).  If being at sea with limited supplies and no wind wasn't bad enough for these pirates a Siren is taken men to their death when they get injured.<br /><br />One of my biggest concerns on this episode was the doctor kept changing his theory (which is fine) however the behavior of the protestant was changing based on the doctors theory and not the doctors theory changing based on the behavior of the Siren.<br /><br />An additional problem I had with the story was I just didn't care if the doctor did or did not save anyone on the ship (minus Rory and Pond of course).
B002R0F3Q2|4.0|I'm a Alicia Keys fan I used to play piano too when I was a child and gave up on it.  Listening to Alicia play the piano reminds that I could have been just as successful.

B003UESJ9M|3.0|This movie ends with a quote from Waylon Jennings' song, so its not all bad.  I love country music, my inclination was to really like this movie but I couldn't.  I was expecting something along the line of Coal Miner's Daughter but I was disappointment.  The movie jumped around too much and you couldn't really get connected with the characters or identify with them, it got frustrating after awhile.  I felt that Kelly Canter was the character that I felt the most empathy for, followed by Beau who seemed to be the best person in the movie.  I loved the music though.  And honestly, like I said, it ends with not only a lyric by Jimmy Webb and sung by Waylon Jennings, but one of my favorite country quotes.  Its an okay movie.
B004Q7DQLS|5.0|With reviews from JR Ward, Larissa Ione, and Jessica Anderson, I figured this book would be worth a shot. Boy was it. It's very well written, great plot line, and definetly not your cookie cutter PNR. Well worth the price!
B0034G4OXQ|3.0|I was disappointed with this movie.  I love Matt Damon and was intrigued by the subject matter, but the story was so disjointed and slow to build, it was difficult to keep watching.

I haven't read a saga this engaging in quite some time.  I'd like to compare it to other series many have been quick to point out, but I think this trilogy will eventually stand on it's own merits.    It's true parts of this sequel seemed to drag ... somewhat.  Nonetheless, I think it was essential to creating this surreal image of the beloved hero of this story.  Maybe this makes 5-stars seem a bit of a stretch, but Patrick Rothfuss is such one hell of a story teller, that I couldn't resist!  I eagerly await the conclusion to this trilogy.  Day three can't get here soon enough!
B001N44BVQ|3.0|I've seen this movie several times and I was not able to figure out why until recently.  It's not the best Ridley Scott movie, even though by now he should be very comfortable with Crowe. And he's certainly had enough experience making movies set in a middle eastern milieu, be it modern or medieval. No, what makes the movie work is Mark Strong as the chief of Jordanian security.  He's got the accent down and he's got the upper-crust, middle eastern sense of superiority and entitlement down. A friend of mine who is Jordanian saw the movie ( he did not know who Strong was) and he told me that this actor was an Arab speaking english for this American made movie. When I told him Strong was an English actor, he couldn't believe it.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|\\"Thor\\" is great! This is how the story goes: Thor, a powerful but arrogant warrior, is sent down to Earth as punishment for reigniting a reckless war. But after a dangerous villain from his world sends the darkest forces of Asgard to invade Earth, the hammer-wielding Thor will learn what it takes to be a true hero in order to save mankind.    The cast led by Chris Hemsworth (great as Thor), Natalie Portman (as Jane Foster) & Anthony Hopkins (as Odin) is great.

This is a great action-packed ride that keeps you on the edge of your seat, your mind thinking and your heart racing. This is another great comic-book movie that has been adapted from the annuls of Marvel Comics. This is also one of the best films to start the summer movieseason off with. This is fun and entertaining.
0316069884|5.0|Safran Foer doesn't pull any punches in his scintillating expose of the meat conundrum. However, the reader never feels assaulted, all of the passion of Foer's argument is channeled towards creating a solid argument in lieu of a session of beratement. The depth his journey takes into the rancid confines of the meat industry is just as poignant as the defense he constructs for food's place in human tradition and familial legacy. I can't promise you that you won't regret reading this book, due to the decisions that will confront you, but you won't finish it without giving Jonathan Safran Foer some well earned respect.

B002ZG9800|1.0|You know, there is a reason why movies with huge well-known stars are completely unknown to you....they stink    Flabby, plotless excuse for wild gay sex on the screen. If it were a good movie with a plot, I wouldn't mind. The fact that this is billed as a \\"true story\\" is an excuse for lameness. Not funny. Not poignant. Character development is weak or non-existent. Jim Carrey wasted. Ewan was shapeless. Plotless. Utterly terrible movie.    My point is simple: rent before you buy. Or, better still, don't rent.

B0034G4P80|4.0|Thor, the latest superhero flick in Marvel's Avengers property, starts the Thunder God cum comic hero on the path that will lead to him becoming one of Earth's Mightiest Heroes.  Starring Chris Hemsworth in the title role, it also boasts Natalie Portman as Jane Foster, Tom Hiddleston as Loki, Colm Feore as Laufey, Jaimie Alexander as Sif, and Anthony Hopkins as Odin.  Rounding out the cast are Idris Elba, Stellan Skarsgard, Rene Russo, Ray Stevenson, Clark Gregg, Joshua Dallas and Tadanobu Asano.<br /><br />It opens with Jane Foster and her small team of storm chasers on the trail of the latest in a series of unusual meteorological occurrences and they nearly run a man down in the process.  Flashback to the Dark Ages where Odin narrates a montage explaining the Nine Realms and the Asgardians war with the Frost Giants of Jotunheim, resulting in a fragile truce.  Skip forward to Thor's ascension day when on the verge of being named Odin's successor a trio of frost giants breaks into the trophy room trying to steal the Cask of Ancient Winters, a powerful jotun artifact taken during the war.  Enraged but ordered by Odin not to retaliate, Thor and his brother Loki, along with their friends Sif, Volstagg, Hodun and Fandral, slip away to Jotunheim to confront Laufey, the frost giant king.  Laufey goads Thor into attacking and only Odin's personal intervention saves the group from destruction, but not before Loki makes a chilling discovery.  Thor challenges his father's inaction and Odin realizes his hotheaded son still has much to learn.  He strips Thor of his power and casts him down to Earth, also sealing away the power of the hammer Mjolnir until Thor is worthy to reclaim it.  Loki confronts Odin about what he's learned- which Odin confesses to- but all the combined stress forces him into the Odinsleep, a hibernation state which replenishes his power.  Acting as regent, Loki devises a scheme that will end the war, as well as serving other purposes.<br /><br />The script is good with some decent jokes both obvious and insider, but stretches paper thin in some places.  Mostly based upon the Marvel Ultimates storylines it draws references from different aspects of Thor's comic book history, including the creative runs of Walt Simonson, J. Michael Straczynski and Ralph Macchio (no, not that one).  Certain things could've used a little more development or exposition, but that would've gotten in the way of a good SFX shot.  But it does a great job maintaining the Avengers continuity that's being established, as well slipping in an intriguing cameo.  It even ties in the Mjolnir teaser clip from Iron Man 2.  And yeah, you need to stay after the credits for this one as well.<br /><br />The FX are as good as we've come to expect- mostly.  The frost giant battle has some nice moments with Thor wielding his hammer in classic comic book form- whipping it around to create storm effects as well as the seminal return to his hand after being thrown.  Asgard is modeled on some form of organic technology that works hand in hand with magic making for a shining, heavenly realm that's just a little too perfect.  Golden spires, gleaming halls, burnished armor- paradise never looked so... fake.  The Bifrost Rainbow Bridge looks like a bunch of LiteBrites low on batteries.  And of course, the frost giants have misshapen forms, glowing red eyes and dwell in the eternal chill gloom of Jotunheim.  Why?  Because they're eee-vil.<br /><br />Chris Hemsworth fills the role like he wrote it himself.  Thor is brash and boastful, even flipping Mjolnir around like it was a toy.  On Earth when he realizes what Odin's done, his angst isn't sappy or whiny, but confused and resolved to make amends.  The best character in the movie is usually the villain, and Tom Hiddleston's Loki steals the show.  It's Loki's character arc that actually drives the movie; his machinations and personal conflict are engaging: at the risk of being geeky, Loki pulls a Batman Gambit- maneuvering people and events while exploiting everyone's natures to do what he wants, but if it fails...  The only problem is initially he's all over the place, doing things that appear to contradict his goals.  But even then there's clues as to what's going on with him, and the payoff delivers.<br /><br />Thor's lifelong friends, The Warriors Three- as they identify themselves- are kind of one-dimensional and cartoonish, but then they were often portrayed that way in the comics.  The only one of his buddies that gets any measure of characterization is Sif, for the obvious reason that she may still end up as a potential love interest.<br /><br />Thor hits all the right notes and should be the first blockbuster of the year.  It does everything it's supposed to and leaves you hungry for more- i.e., Captain America and XMen: First Class.  Can't wait.xploiting everyone's natures to do what he wants, but if it fails...

B001N1DPDE|4.0|So this knife is razor sharp right out of the box, if you don't believe me just ask my fingers.  I dropped it as when i first removed it from the sheath and as it fell i caught it by the blade and almost cut to the bone on my ring finger on my left hand.  I'm not to sure i like the plastic handles that come with it or the way the are attached to the blade itself, although it does have really great ergonomics.  As for the sheath i like how tough it is. I'm not usually pleased with kydex sheaths but i tuck a hammer to this one after leaving it in the freezer for 30 min and it didn't crack or anything.  I may one day upgrade mine to a HEDGEHOGLEATHERWORKS.COM sheaths.  If you have never heard of them check them out i'm sure you will be pleased with the quality.
B004P8K1WU|2.0|The authors offer a classification of aid philosophies: _supply wallahs_ and _demand wallahs_. The _supply wallahs_ believe that the poverty is caused by the lack of the goods that are needed to escape poverty. What are these goods? The authors offer the following list: food, health, education, contraception, insurance, banks and entrepreneurship. They devote one chapter to each of these topics. The _demand wallahs_ point to the long string of failed aid projects and claim that what is missing is a demand for these products. For reasons known only to those making the choices. _Demand wallahs_ are skeptical of any top down intervention.<br /><br />Jeff Sachs is the best known _supply wallahs_. He has argued that small cheap interventions like free mosquito nets can have huge benefits. William Easterly is the best known _demand wallah_. He is a trenchant critic of top down interventions. The book criticizes both of these philosophies. They chide the _supply wallahs_ for not scientifically evaluating potential aid strategies. The author's evaluation tool of choice is the _Randomized Control Trial_ (RCT) (akin to the technique used to evaluate new drugs). They disagree with the _demand wallahs_ by pointing to successful aid strategies (success as measured by RCTs).  The authors take the stance: We have no overarching theory of what aid strategy is likely to work. But we will evaluate individual strategies rigorously. And recommend whatever works.<br /><br />The chapters all follow a pattern: First the authors present a puzzle (e.g. why don't the poor eat more when they earn more?). Then they (half-heartedly) try to explain the behavior by giving us more insight into the lives of the poor. These sections are the best part of each chapter.  But the authors say that they are still unable to explain the seemingly irrational behavior. Now, they throw up their hands and appeal to something called _behavioral economics_. Humans are irrational and they need brilliant economists to design aid strategies that take their irrationality into account. And \\"nudge\\" them to do the \\"right\\" thing. We are told that citizens of rich countries have benevolent \\"nudgers\\". But who \\"nudged\\" Europe and America from poverty to wealth a few hundred years ago? That question is not tackled by the authors.<br /><br />While RCTs sound very scientific, no mention is made of the problem of \\"data mining\\". i.e. the problem of finding \\"statistically significant\\" results simply by trying out a large number of strategies. Spurious results will not work \\"out of sample\\". How have the rigorously vetted strategies done when used \\"out of sample\\"? We are not told. The comparison to drug testing raises other questions: There are many critics who claim that that the FDA generates more costs than the benefits. RCTs only tell us if a drug works for the average person. But is that the right question? Since there is so much variation amongst people, might not some people benefit from a drug? Similarly for the aid strategy. A more general concern about the book is the astonishing degree of confidence that a \\"solution\\" to poverty exists. And that \\"solution\\" is amenable to the methods of science. Authors are no doubt familiar with Hayek's criticism of _scientism_. I wonder how they would react to it.<br /><br />This is an ambitious book. The best parts of the book are the descriptions of the lives of the poor. For example, the description of the mechanics of micro credit is very interesting. But the book fails to tackle more important questions: What are the limitations of RCTs? What is the role of religion and culture? The technocratic and paternalistic tone of book jars. I leave the reader with the following excerpt. This is a rare reference to religion I was able to find in the book: \\"When the poor actually know what they want -- marrying their daughter to someone from the right caste or religion, to take an *unfortunate* but important example -- they are not at all easy to bribe\\".<br />After reading this sentence, I am forced to conclude that all the author's talk of respect for the choices of the poor is mere talk., I am forced to conclude that all the author's talk of respect for the choices of the poor is mere talk.

B004IQMXD4|5.0|To those who think Stevie may have lost her touch, think again!  'In Your Dreams' was well worth the 10 year wait for her newest work.  Still sounding as great as ever, Stevie Nicks rocks them and rolls through a mix of sultry ballads and upbeat tunes, reminiscent of her early solo work.  For me, the highlights of \\"In Your Dreams\\" are \\"Everybody Loves You\\" and \\"Ghosts Are Gone\\"... contrasting styles of unspeakable beauty and fiery rocking!   If there is a tune in this CD that doesn't thrill me, it's 'Soldier's Angel', as it just doesn't fit for me.  The other 12 are simply amazing.  Stevie has never sounded better and her teamwork with Dave Stewart has paid off.  I am thrilled that the rock world still has Stevie Nicks as she is one of a kind.  Bless you, Enchanted One!
0316056863|5.0|Is what I would say if I were not a fan of Miss Fey and her hilarious, over-the-top, and magically delicious memoir, \\"Bossypants,\\" the heartwarming story of a woman who manages to write both SNL and \\"30 Rock\\" despite her handicap (in some people's eyes) of having lady parts. Women can indeed be funny, and Tina Fey is among the funniest.<br /><br />The book is chock-full of revelations about Fey, such as the fact that 1.) she's a writer, and 2.) she is a woman. I did not know any of this when I picked it up, but now I'm wise to those facts. Also, she bears a striking resemblence to a certain former governor of Alaska, if by \\"striking\\" you mean \\"brown hair and glasses.\\" As one character in \\"The Producers\\" says upon learning that the \\"Third Reich\\" meant \\"Germany,\\" this book is chock-full of historical nuggets like that.<br /><br />I was not always a fan of Miss Fey, as I was under the impression that SNL sucked for five years because of her (now I realize that's the natural cycle of the show, regardless of who's in charge). Then I became a convert when \\"The Office\\" went off one night and \\"30 Rock\\" began. Fey shares the backstage tale of how the show came to be and why it's still on the air (her answer: Alec Baldwin). I am firmly in her camp now, and will not allow any other candidate to be nominated by my party. All hail Miss Fey.<br /><br />So if you enjoy being yelled at by a book, pick up the latest Ann  Coulter discharge. If you enjoy a good laugh and elitest humor at the expense of the working man, pick up this book. You'll like it better once you realize it's hilarious, but you might be disappointed by the lack of nudity and/or Obama-bashing. Nudity and Obama-bashing are the hallmarks of a successful book these days, sometimes exclusive of one another but mostly not. USA!<br /><br />Now then, why haven't you gotten this book already? What are you, a commie pinko?

I didn't see any grain.  It even looks great when it is paused.  The audio is Dolby Digital 5.1 (not Dolby TrueHD or DTS-HD Master Audio), but is great anyway.  Lots of surround sound and sub-woofer bass.  All Blu-Rays should be of this quality.

B0034G4P80|4.0|As Marvel continues their quest to create an entire film universe for their heroes to run around in, their latest effort at expanding this ever-growing library involves the god of thunder himself, Thor.  Compared to many other comic book hero films that have come out over the past several years, can \\"Thor\\" stand up?    \\"Thor\\" follows the titular god of thunder, and his mischievous brother Loki.  On the day of his ascension to the throne of Asgard, fabled home of the Norse gods, an old enemy manages to infiltrate Asgard and nearly make away with a dangerous weapon.  Overreacting, Thor sets out to prove his worth, only to set in motion a disastrous series of events that could lead to a mythological war, and his own permanent exile from those he loves.    Unlike the other films set in the Marvel Universe, \\"Thor\\" takes a heavy mythological route with it's story, which is a tried-and-true \\"Fish out of water/Coming of age\\" story.  While the plot itself is predictable, the movie benefits from it's production values and a good sense of humor.  Marvel put a lot of time, effort, and resources into the film, and it shows:  Asgard is big and beautiful, easily a realm of gods, and the costumes, weapons, and creatures are beautiful to look at.  And to make things even better, \\"Thor\\" has a great sense of humor, with some very funny jokes fitting into the theme of Thor being out of his element on Earth, especially with a scene set in a pet store.    However, Thor does suffer somewhat from being a bit short.  While the film has a run time close to two hours, the second and third acts of the film move from one beat to the next at close to breakneck speed.  By the time the film finishes, it's hard to believe that's it's actually done, leaving the feeling that there's too much story crammed into too short a running time.    But despite it's pacing issues, \\"Thor\\" is an excellent comic-book film that features a large mythological scope, great comedy, high production values, and engagingaction.  All of it combines to create a film that, while slightly overstuffed, is still great fun, and well worth watching, making it arguably one of the better Marvel films to date.
B004LL1HM4|5.0|On rare occasions, a unique group of musicians will find each other and through some inexplicable mystical process, the spirits of those involved join together and an explosion of creativity that is special to its time in history is produced.  Usually, there are one or more who direct the energies, but all participate in the birthing of music that can seem almost magical in its ability to deeply touch the hearts of those who listen.    In the 1960s, the Beatles accomplished this.  They created music that evoked wonder and joy in a way never experienced by many who heard it.  Their songs were truly irresistible.  And now, nearly a half-century later, Fleet Foxes have somehow acquired that same \\"lightning in a bottle,\\" exemplified by their latest release, \\"Helplessness Blues.\\"    Make no mistake: this album is not simply a collection of songs.  It is absolutely \\"art.\\"  The band has created an aural masterpiece which will surely be hailed as a classic in future decades.  From the astonishingly imaginative songwriting and ethereal voice of leader Robin Pecknold, to the astounding musicianship and vocal harmonies of the other band members, the album is an experience that is both vaguely haunting and yet, exhilerating and emotionally satisfying as well.    \\"Helplessness Blues\\" almost sounds as if it could've been released in 1967, at the dawning of the Summer of Love.  That's not to suggest it seems dated, but the album does shine with the same charmingly brilliant creativity that was so evident during that amazing year -- sort of like a mixture of \\"Sgt. Pepper,\\" Phil Spector and Brian Wilson combined.  The combinations of musical textures, lyrics and vocals within the individual songs are breathtaking.    As to the musicianship itself, it's refreshing and exciting to hear tributes to different cultures and genres with the use of a variety of instruments and rhythms.  And the band sounds tight enough to be able to \\"finish each other's sentences,\\" musically.    I've seen Fleet Foxes in concert twice, and I've been amazed at how their shows attract everyone from young teens to senior citizens.  This is no coincidence, and it's not surprising that the band's music is touching and connecting with people of varied ages and backgrounds.  Anyone who has ever sought to know his or her place in the world, or yearned for a portal to their own Summer of Love will \\"get\\" Fleet Foxes and \\"Helplessness Blues.\\"
B002EWD0I6|4.0|After viewing many intense and \\"nail biting\\" detective/mystery shows (e.g., \\"Luther \\", \\"Murphy's Law\\",  \\"Murdock\\" ,  \\"Touch of Frost\\", \\"Midsomer Murders\\"  et al), this very good BBC presentation on  four (4) discs with ten (10) episodes that are about an hour in length  , gave me a great deal of respite from all of the mayhem and blood that I that I tend to view.  In this season one (1) of \\"Lark Rise to Candleford\\" we are introduced to some very gentle folks in the gorgeous and beautifully filmed Oxfordshire countryside in the 19th century.  This series (at least in Volume one) is very well acted and directed with stories that are easy to view--no blood or violence, just people living their lives in some very gentle times. The people are made up of mainly farm-workers and folks that can build \\"things\\" with their hands.     There are two (2) communities, Lark Rise and Candleford with Lark Rise being more \\"countrified\\" and Candleford being more \\"citified\\" having a post office and a little more \\"bustle\\" to it.     The stories heroine, Laura Timmins comes from a small and loving family in Lark Rise to Candleford to work and learn how to be a post office mistress. There she finds scandals, secrets, jealousies, feuds, hidden loves, pettiness,etc.   Her adventures in both communities and with the fascinating inhabitants therein are what make up the stories of this presentation.  All in all, I enjoyed visiting some very gentle times that are shown in this program

B004TTMYQG|5.0|Being a former BlackBerry user, I have never been really thrilled with the calendar app on my EVO. Fortunately, UNLIKE on the BlackBerry, there are several alternatives to the stock app. I had already been using the &quot;Smooth Calendar&quot; widget as a convenient easy to display my next six, most important appointments. Then, I picked up this app on a free giveaway from Amazon.<br /><br />I am so happy with it! This is an app that I would definitely consider paying for. I say consider bc I think that $5 might be a little steep, but I wouldn't necessarily feel like I wasted my money if I bought it. Quality app. I REALLY like the interface, viewing options, and appointment-entering mode.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I just discovered Firefly from a Nerdist podcast with Chris Hardwick on which Nathan Fillion was the guest.  Who knew.<br />He described Firefly as a \\"Space Western\\" and it certainly is.  Great humor, great fun, great show.  The DVD is a perfect collection of all these super shows.
1594202842|5.0|Amy Chua's book is marvelous.  Her conversational style, her willingness to honestly expose some of the most personal moments in her family's past, and her often humourous take on \\"Chinese\\" parenting techniques weave together perfectly.  Anyone who is \\"shocked\\" by what they have read has missed the central point of this book: that Chua isn't demanding that she is completely right, indeed, she's claiming just the opposite.  Instead, she's pointing out that there are strengths to be found in different methods, while also admitting that her own daughter humbled her in the end!    Although raised by Western parents who perhaps did not have quite the same methods, I can distinctly sense similarities between how I was raised and how Chua has raised and is raising her daughters.  She recognizes just how important it is to establish early on in a child's life a hard work ethic, a sense of pride in the product of that work, and even a purposeful ambition to drive that person for the rest of his or her life.  I thank my parents every day for instilling those same qualities in me and it seems to have worked well for Chua's daughters, who are well-adjusted and successful.    I highly recommend this book, not only because it is an entertaining and well-written memoir, but also because it is a provocative look at what parenting in another culture looks like.  As she's said many times before, this is not a \\"how-to guide.\\"  This is her experience, told in a humorous and honest light, and put out there for all to see.  And for that, I think we should be grateful!

B0012Q732O|2.0|One nice thing about the period from 30,000 BC to about 7000 BC, from the little we know from archeology (Maritja Gimbutas), is that during this Paleolithic age, the Goddess reigned.  A massive amount of Goddess statuary exists from this time period, and we do not see \\"God\\" sculptures until closer to 7000 BC, when a God comes into existence as a son/consort of the Goddess.      Unfortunately, we don't see anything like this in this movie.  I don't believe that movies have to be true to life: they're often more fun if they're not.  However, we have far too many male warrior-hero movies: we really don't need more and more and more of this type of story, particularly when our civilization is under threat of collapse because of the male-dominated warrior-hero way it's been run for the last 5000 years.  We need a return to the GOddess, and this movie missed a good opportunity to help in that.      In this movie, there are hundreds, no -- thousands -- of male characters, but only two female characters.  One of the female characters is nothing much more than a prize for the male hero, and the other, a Shamanic priestess of her ancient tribe, ends up sacrificing her own life in order that the life of the young male hero might be happier and fruitful.  So this story, instead of being centered on the Goddess, is really about the \\"death\\" of the GOddess as a sort of sacrifice for the birth of a male-centered, warrior-based, patriarchal culture in which women really have no signifcant role to play as individuals in their own right.  WHich is not really the story of 10,000 BC, it's the story of 3000 BC to the present time.

B003XRZZFM|5.0|And that's not really bad in my view.<br /><br />I'm not a purist in any real musical genre.  But I've been a Dimmu Borgir fan since 2003 with Death Cult Armageddon.  Since then, I've tasted virtually all their albums, and found that the sound displayed with that album and its predecessor (Puritanical Euphoric Misanthropia) was my favorite, with violent guitars and drums, thunderous orchestra, and crispy vocals going between Shagrath's throaty gagging and Vortex's boistrous operatic voice.  I even love Enthrone Darkness Triumphant, am still puzzled by Spiritual Black Dimensions (it has some of my favorite Dimmu Borgir songs ever, but I still don't get some of it), was bored by Stormblast, enjoyed only a few tracks from For All Tid, and was extremely disappointed by In Sorte Diaboli.<br /><br />Regarding the style Dimmu Borgir apparently adopted in 2001 with Puritanical Euphoric Misanthropia, this album is more of the same.  Virtually the exact same sounding guitars, orchestra, and vocals.  Vortex is gone, so his voice is definitely missing.  But the songs sound great, catchy, powerful, and musically pleasing.  Dimmu Borgir and Cradle of Filth are the only Black Metal bands I listen to, and maybe it's not entirely a good thing for Dimmu Borgir to put out this album with virtually the same sound and style as much of their previous work, but I don't know enough of the genre to be able to \\"get my fill elsewhere\\"---Dimmu Borgir is MY only source for this type of music, so I'll continue to listen in and enjoy.
031603438X|5.0|I actually borrowed this book from a work mate and had a ball reading it. At first I thought it was just gonna be one drug and sex orgy to the next and assuredly there are those kind of scenes in the book but it wasn't like that all. I was truly impressed with Keef's love of music, the blues and rock and roll. I am always truly amazed that at the time what we American teenagers took for granted in available rock and roll records the Brits found rare and hard to come by. I don't know the reason why but rock'n'roll will never die!
B0034G4P80|5.0|Look, lower the hammer, I gave it 5 stars.  I was going to give it 5 stars anyway.  Man.<br />Thor is standing behind me, breathing down my neck.  Luckily, he can't read English.  Oh, drat, he can.  Okay, okay, self \\"don't type anything bad about the movie, don't type anything bad about the movie.\\"  Alright, I'm getting on with it.<br /><br />The ladies will certainly like this movie, as the actor playing Thor is a well-built hunk of man who is shirtless for about a minute.  (Good, now he's smiling.)  In fact, Chris Hemsworth clearly is the best actor ever to play a comic book character, sorry, um Norse God, alien (what are you again?)  He wants me to write \\"being from another realm.\\"  Okay.  (He's still not smiling.  Probably thinks I went overboard with the \\"best actor\\" bit.)  Although the character starts off a bit immature (calm down!) about 2/3 into the movie, he becomes a true hero, by any measure of the word (Well, at least he's not frowning, but he's not smiling.  I don't do my best work under duress, you know.)<br /><br />He is a very honorable character throughout.  Although any human woman would love to be his companion due to his incredible good looks, impressive build, wit, charm, and humor, he takes advantage of no one.  In fact, he won't even take the initiative to kiss a woman on the lips, and charmingly kisses her hand instead.  And he can drink any human male under the table. (Smiling now, wrap it up, quick).<br /><br />All in all, one of the best comic book films in a long time.  Much better than Green Hornet (don't hit me!)
B004SBS8LA|2.0|great when it runs.. every time i get notice that amazon app store has quit.  it also freezes up and i have to quit ..reopen the app  ....this happens frequently enough that i just quit playing...please please fix....
B0042X9L6A|5.0|Pros:<br />Fast Recharge<br />Intuitive Controls<br />Good Feature set for Price<br />Clip on gels<br />Compact<br /><br />Cons:<br />Restricted operating modes<br />No \\"A\\" (auto thyristor) mode<br />Only single CTO gel (doesn't have 1/4, 1/2, etc CTO available)<br /><br />Bottom Line:  This is a great flash.  Since I don't do a lot of the highly advanced flash setups or use more than 2 or 3 flashes, the SB700 was a fine choice vs the SB900.  I do mostly bounce flash and felt that the SB700 was powerful enough.  Exposures were always spot on.  Recharge from a full power shot is only about 2 seconds with NiMH cells.<br /><br />The best part of the flash is I was able to pick it up and use it without reading the owners manual.  The controls are even more intuitive than the SB900.  I like that there is a simple slider switch to change between modes and beam patterns.  The gels are easy to use (although they can be difficult to get lined up just right) and they are convenient.<br /><br />The flash is small compared to the SB900, which is a good thing.  I am indifferent to the case design.  It works great in my hard plastic case, but my bags are designed for flashes to slip in when they are opened so the reflector is pointing straight up, so consider this with your bag.<br /><br />At first my fear was the SB700 would not be enough flash for me after using a friend's SB900, but I didn't use the special features the SB900 had anyway, and feel that the power from the 700 is good enough for what I do that the SB700 was the better buy.  I do not regret my decision.
0470876417|5.0|May be one of the best business books I have ever read.   In the beginning the way how book is constructed feels  a bit strange, but when one gets used to it, it makes sense.    This book does not teach how to make business, nor basic business  fundamentals found in other books. It is not intended to be   a replacement of other business literature. It teaches a simple  but powerfull tool for creating and analyzing business models.     A well woth of small money it costs if you have to think how you existing  or future business will work.
0618001905|5.0|I highly recommend this to anyone interested in history, African affairs, or who just needs a great read. I couldn't put this down. Hochschild is a brilliant writer, story teller, and historian who backs up the horror of Leopold's colonization of the Congo with personal journals and documentation.  He brings this dark chapter of human history to life. A must buy!

B0041T4ML4|5.0|As a first time reader of this author, I was incredibly impressed with the future society he has created here that was largely a believable one in my mind.  Biological modification of our food supply is the macro-issue dealt with in this novel, and it takes the form of a failed future world, and not a utopia of equality.  The characters really sell this book as a fantastic read and the novelty of the world makes it a book I highly recommend.    At it's crux, the book deals with capitalism and racism(Both standard and against genetically modified humans called 'Windups' like the title).  The capitalist world view has the world's food supplies obliterated with biological warfare and placing all the power with agriculture conglomerates through their total control of the world by the sale of resistant strains of rice and other plant-based food sources.  Suddenly, the world's obesity problem is turned on its head and we move to the base of Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs quickly.  The book quickly the reader of how fast we can revert to dictatorial and superstitious people when our basic needs are under threat and societal benefit is subservient to the needs of the individual.      From dealing with violent dictators with overwhelming xenophobia to a real and pressing feeling of armageddon the reader is thrust deeply into four different perspectives - the capitalist calorie man(Businessman), a member of the local army(The idealist), the transient Chinese outsider(immigrant), and the true outsider(the windup girl).  Each perspective give a deep and fulfilling experience for the reader as we begin to sympathize with each of them and realize that each of them is also deeply flawed.    I recommend this book to all my friends who read fiction.  Although it's taken some of the current world's issues to a logical extreme, it does it in such a way that I can't help but feel that this is a possible future world I may end up living in.
B002JVWQSW|1.0|Was so happy to receive the dvd, but when I went to put it in and play it, it did not work at all!  It said that this dvd was formatted for a different region!?!?!  I have a multi zone dvd so it should have worked anyway!  Figured it was just a fluke and ordered a replacement...  same thing!!!  Would highly recommend simply buying elsewhere.  Amazon's price is great, but if you cannot watch it, it is not worth it!  Amazon is good about replacements, and lets hope about refunds (since I am sending the replacement back today and requesting a refund).  I have bought many things from them, including dvds, and this is the first time this has happened.  I had also read another reviewer saying the exact same thing about buying Modern Family and decided to ignore and buy anyway...  big mistake!
B003XKPPOU|5.0|Pixar gets human nature more than any movie studio out there, and then carefully crafts screenplays and characters that make us laugh, make us cry on occasion, and always make us totally forget we are watching an animated film.  We become part of it.  And in the hands of Pixar, that is never a bad thing.  I think what distinguishes this film from the previous two, other than the leap in animation technology and the studio's experience  in telling stories, is the wicked sense of humor in this screenplay.  And executing that humor in a script which  appeals to at least three generations of moviegoers without letting it be at the expense of the younger audience.<br /><br />Andy's leaving home.  Without giving away too much of the plot, what we see here is a sensitive lesson in the difference in loss from abandonment and neglect, and loss from growing up and moving on.  And the difference between the two.  The storyline with Lotso demonstrates that you can't always read a book by it's cover, and that bullies can smell like strawberries too.  That big babies can be evil when they fall in with the wrong crowd.  Ken modeling his wardrobe for Barbie shows that even macho guys like Ken have a weakness for clothes.  And Spanish Space men make cowgirls go weak in the knees, especially in dangerous situations.  I haven't laughed this hard since seeing Lucy and Ethel dance on grapes, and haven't cried this hard since the beginning of the mortgage crisis.<br /><br />People die.  Kids leave home.  Recycling is good.  And if you bully the other kids too much, you just might end up being a hood ornament on a garbage truck.  Thanks Pixar.  Alongside The King's Speech, it was the best of 2010.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray version is stunning.  The colors are rich, the detail sharp and crisp, and enough special features to keep you busy for hours.  No one can package a Blu-Ray like Disney.

0756404738|2.0|The Name of the Wind was a mesmerizing tale and not only the greatest fantasy book, but close to the best piece of literature I had read in a long time. The long wait for Rothfuss to complete the second book kept me checking amazon and the author's blog for news about the delayed publication. When it finally appeared on the shelf I was overjoyed. 200 pages into the mammoth 998 pg book, I am ready to through it across the room in frustration.    The book is boring.    Rothfuss falsely believes that the hook of his first book will be enough to keep us enthralled through the slow evolution of his second book. That may have been true if he hadn't kept us waiting for 4 years. I've waited long enough, I'm not going to waste more time waiting for something interesting to happen in this book. Not a single antagonist has appeared in over 200 pages. There are some slight allusions to the plot of the last book, but even the main antagonist, Ambrose, only has a few lines. That's right, the main antagonist is not even an actual character. He's just spoken about.    While Rothfuss is a master of detail and character, if I wanted to read about an interesting character's challenges attending a high class university, I wouldn't be reading fantasy. Even as a librarian, the endless scenes of our hero trolling the archives, researching the demons that destroyed his life is mind-numbing. Hero's should be battling demons, not researching them!     The writing and character development is high quality, but the complete lack of an interesting, suspenseful, imaginative plot makes me think that Rothfuss should try his hand at writing a different genre. Fantasy should never be boring.
0316067938|5.0|As usual, I was not disappointed by my transaction with Amazon.  The book got here quickly, it was in the condition described and the price was right.  BTW, love the book and can't wait to see the movie.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I love the way Tina Fey writes. Her book is sharp, witty, fast paced, relevant, smart and of course, funny.  I was already a fan of Tina Fe and I have liked her from SNL, through 30 Rock, but you do not need to be a fan to enjoy the book.  We can all related to her humorous stories of awkward teen years, bumbling early career moves and crazy workplace happenings.  I only wish I had purchased the book and not the Kindle version so I could lend it to my teenage daughter and her friends (they are huge Tina Fey fans too!).
B00065GX64|5.0|Just a great film! The imagery was stark and brooding, pools of light the only interruption to this dark world of black and grey. All the characters were there and rather then follow a single hero (save perhaps the murderer, stalking his prey) there was a multitude caught in this web, all with parts to play. Echoes of later 'greats' are framed here and still find use in cinema today (the use of angle, shadow, expression and sound or the juxtaposition of imagery and stereotypes: the innocent; the monster; the cagey detective; the thief). No music other then the whistled notes on the murderer's lips breaks the often silent street scape. The additions of extra scenes cut from the original release are great but often slow the pace and interrupt the mounting pressure, however the quality of the picture is wonderful, no silver tones lost in the haunting and beautiful B/W images, and clear voices throughout. Peter Lorre - those eyes: two frightened pools in the dark!     Ah, such a great way to spend an afternoon. I will watch this again when my desire calls for something more then the splash of red on a pavement, which too often today's suspense thrillers offer. Worth every dollar and more!!

B0036CIQK0|4.0|A very interesting book that provides some valuable insights into the involuntary way that human beings present themselves and react in certain situations. The book contains plenty of examples and details about the body language of people in certain situations. These situations could be when they are happy, when they are under pressure or even not telling the truth.<br /><br />In many aspects this book will help you sharpen your skills and better understand what is really going on inside a person. It won't make you a human lie detector but it certainly will make you more observant of the subtle signals that everybody broadcasts when they communicate. The book is valuable reading for anyone but has application in business where it will improve your ability to negotiate and unveil the hidden meaning of conversations.<br /><br />The book is easy to read and contains plenty of examples and illustration to aid in comprehension. You are probably not going to be able to remember all the topics on first reading but it is certainly book that you'll be able to refer to again and again without becoming bored. In this day and age of electronic communications we need to remember that it is still human beings at the end of these. Human being are social animals and a significant part of our communication occur through non verbal signals. This book will help you better decipher what is really going on in your face to face relationships.
B004UID2LC|4.0|Awesome app. Very easy to use. Great quality videos and decent download speed. Only issue I have with it is it won't let you specify where to save the files. This forces me to usea file manager to move them into my videos folder every time I download something.   Also, why does it need to download a .jpg for every video I download? This makes even more work in my file manager to delete the excess junk.

1596680180|1.0|This book was nothing like what I thought it would be.  The name of it makes you think the book is going to show you how to do different kinds of braids and knots that are used in braiding.  The absolute most important knot in braiding is the Terminal knot and nowhere in this book did the Terminal knot show up.  I found more information on the internet about different kinds of braids than in this book.  Very disappointed in this book and a total waste of my money.
1439102813|5.0|This is a fictional novel written from the perspective of the diseased person. The accuracy of the content is chilling. The resources articulated in the book are most helpful. I am currently assisting a gentleman with early onset Alzheimer's Disease and found his circumstances sadly and accurately portrayed in the book.  This is a must read. An Alzheimer's patient sadly noted that when he attended an Alzheimer's meeting he felt welcome and comfortable bacause he knew that every other person in attendance either shared his affliction or understood the role of caregiver to an afflicted person but he could not sense that in a public restaurant where certainly there might be others but no one would know. This is a sad but essential book to have in your library!!!!

B0000AK7AB|5.0|What is the definition of personification? Provide an example. This movie is about a pig that talks, hangs out in the house, herds sheep, saves sheep, fights wild dogs, and fights with cats. If that's not enough it also features an old man dancing a jig to some serious Celtic tunes. Score! Sound awesome? It is. Go watch it. This movie even makes sheep herding appear awesome and exciting. Amazing!<br /><br />Personification:The attribution of a personal nature or human characteristics to something nonhuman, or the representation of an abstract quality in human form.<br /><br />One last note: If your pets talk to you on a daily basis, this movie is for you!
B004NCLKJG|5.0|Several things. First, in this case Sony's claim of \\"first time on CD\\" is true. Second, for those of you raised on more modern casts, do yourself a favor and grab this one. Here's Wagner sung and conducted as it should be. Third, Sony/Columbia has a long history of being scared by success. When titles or series are snapped up, they stop them cold.<br /><br />I won't go into a discussion of the cast as these singers are too well known to warrant such except to say that all are in peak form. My only quibble is that Sony didn't include even a bit of Milton Cross' comments.<br /><br />Here's a great recording in clear sound. Grab it.
B003L77GRO|3.0|Look, don't get me wrong, I love Dexter, but this is by far the weakest season.  The story line was just ridiculous, even by Dexter standards.  I loathed Julia Stiles in this, she is such an unlikeable actress.  I really never felt any investment in her circumstance, I couldnt have cared less what happened to her..I kept yelling at the screen..GET ON THE PLANE, B**CH, YOU'RE RUINING THE SHOW!..On the flip side, the actor playing Jordan was fantastic!!..I wanted more of him and less of her!  The story between he and Dexter was what drove the season.  Again, Dexter's rail thin profanity laiden sister, Deb was the limit...I mean, you're a cop in Miami and you don't know an fing WORD of Spanish?!!..WTF!..It all wrapped up well, I suppose, but I was left feeling...What happened to my Dexter!!

What they have accomplished is no surprise.  This is a page turner and simultaniously a lesson in discipline and love of your country.

Are these REALLY dreams? he begins to wonder. (And why do some of the other residents in the nursing home begin having such dreams, too?).  If you were intrigued by the confounding of simulation and reality in Card's \\"Ender's Game,\\" you will be no less intrigued by the confounding of dream and reality in this book.          So why have I not told you the title of the book and named its author?  Because (alas!) I don't remember either one of them; I read the book something like (I think) 15-20 years ago, and I remember only the plot details that I've mentioned, plus the ending (which, of course, I won't tell you, because you will want to experience that for yourself).           But if you happen to be someone who, like me, once-upon-a-time read the book I'm talking about, and if you have a better memory than I do, and if you can write your own review of Scalzi's \\"Old Man's War\\" and include in your review the title and author of the book that eludes me, PLEASE, PLEASE do (for even better than reading or rereading TWO fine science fiction novels is reading or rereading THREE fine science fiction novels).  A lot of readers besides me will be indebted to you...very much indebted.
0439023521|5.0|I have read many books but never took the time to write a review. I felt that this book deserved the time it would take to write one. The synopsis of this story caught my attention and I quickly began reading. By page 10 of the first book, I was on amazon purchasing the next two books, and making sure to select the quickest shipment possible. Within the first few pages you are quickly thrown into the world of Katniss, who has basically sacrificed her own life, to save her sister's, by taking her spot in the Hunger Games. The book is edgy, thrilling, full of action, and even seems to find time for love. You will not be disappointed, just make sure to have the second book on hand right after you finish the first.

B00103584Y|4.0|When her boyfriend, Manni, loses 100,000 German marks that belong to his mafia boss, Lola has just 20 minutes to somehow find that impossible amount and bring it to him before he does something dangerous.  She can run fast, but it may not be fast enough to save his life.  Combining animation, snapshots, vibrant colored film, with video and black and white sequences, Tom Twyker tells an exciting action adventure love story, that marked a new era of German and world cinema.  The intensity, the colors, the music, all brought together in an avant-garde style that combines classical storytelling techniques with MTV-era edits, is unique and exhilarating.  It's like a music video and video game and fairy tale and art film, all rolled into one.  It's like [[ASIN:B001WLMOLO Last Year at Marienbad]] on speed, where the intellectual intrigue and excitement is matched by real and visceral thrills.<br /><br />The film opens with a quotation from T.S. Elliot, juxtaposed quickly with another from a famous German soccer coach, suggesting up front the film's aims to transcend the distinction between popular and high-brow entertainment, poetry and sport, art and action.  In my mind, the film succeeds tremendously.  The acting throughout is strong, but Franka Potente channels Lola with a combination of fierce determination and vulnerability that is fascinating to watch.<br /><br />The opening scene establishes the philosophical dimensions of the story, with a light touch.  Images of anonymous humanity, with emphasis on a seemingly random few individuals here and there, are accompanied by a narrator.  Human beings ask endless questions, and every answer provokes new questions.  In the end they all come down to a single question and a single answer: the ball is round, and the game lasts 90 minutes.  If life is a game, there are some basic guidelines: at some point the game ends, and there are basic parameters such as laws of nature that can't be violated.  Beyond that: it's all theory.  Twyker employs a unique approach to non-linear storytelling, in order to explore what matters and what's in our control in the context of a life where so much is left to chance.  To say much more would be to spoil some of the delight of seeing this film for the first time.  I've seen it several, and get something new each viewing.  It's like the spiral that serves as a primary visual motif throughout the film, the circle that turns back upon itself with a difference each time.  Or like the line from Elliot that gets things rolling: the end of our adventures is when we come back to the beginning and see it fresh as if for the very first time.  I get that feeling every time I watch this film.  Highly recommended.s a unique approach to non-linear storytelling, in order to explore what matters and what's in our control in the context of a life where so much is left to chance.

B004SQS9FA|5.0|Let it first be known that Radiohead is near and dear to my music-box heart.  That said, I am fully aware that some Radiohead can be rather brash, spastic, and at times out of reach for the casual listener.  The King of Limbs, however, is a panoply of delight, depth, repetition, variation, synthetic sound, and organic structure that is difficult for just about anyone not to enjoy.  Captivating melodies and harmonic structures move the listener through a bright, cool world of intricate and nuanced sounds.  Simply put, nothing is out of place in this album and nothing goes on for too long.  Furthermore, for the discerning ear, Radiohead employs a delightful array of technical, modern, and even minimalist musical concepts that are at once simple in their use and complex in structure.     Here is a short overview of what I found to be the most interesting aspects of each track, though volumes more could be said about each one.  The opening track, \\"Bloom,\\" immediately washes the listener with repetitive melodic synth loops and tiny, granular synthesized sounds.  The percussion loop backs these audacious openings and leads through a developing melody, while the rhythm never changes.  If one listens carefully at the melodic crescendo, bird sounds can even be heard - a theme that will be repeated elsewhere in the album.  The second and third tracks, Morning Mr. Magpie and Little By Little respectively, show a continuation of the theme of percussion loops and guitar-driven melodies that walk up or down a tonal scale.  The fourth song, Feral, gets a little more intense on the granular percussion and has vocal melodies that may be a little too busy for the casual listener, but it is certainly a very interesting song due to the building percussion dynamic.    The fifth song, Lotus Flower, is where the album takes a turn for the sublime.  Lotus Flower is one of the more pop-oriented songs on the album and has a less busy percussion line driven primarily by a fantastic gated snare.  The melody is rather catchy and makes for an easy song to sing.  Codex, the next track, is a hauntingly beautiful, smoothly-paced soundscape of sorts.  There are three piano chords that make up the backbone of the melodic riff and are followed by a cascading, metallic granular synthesis that brings to mind the tranquil waters of the clear lake about which Thom York sings.  Soon, a muted and reverbed trumpet joins Yorke's smooth vocal flourishes to finish out the song.  The final 15 seconds of the track are a curious bit-crushed, slowed, and reversed sound clip that is revealed at the beginning of the next track, Give Up The Ghost, to be a recorded clip with voices and birds.  This sets the tone for Give Up The Ghost, along with clean acoustic guitar, of an easy and calm counterpoint to the previous track.  The final track, Separator, rivals Lotus Flower for its listenable qualities as far as popular standards are concerned.  This track, like many others, depends on two recorded and looped measures of 4/4 drum beat for the rhythm.  The melody is heavily accented, with the clean electric guitar and vocals each being run through filters and echoed and/or reverbed to a great extent, but not so much as to be distorted.      The end of this deceptively short (at least by previous Radiohead standards) album is less of an end than a call to observation of the natural soundscape, in my opinion.  Thom Yorke reminds the listener, \\"If you think this is over, then you're wrong\\" and ends with a simple demand.  \\"Wake me up,\\" says Yorke, perhaps in order that he may enjoy the organic soundscape so constantly referenced in this complex and enjoyable electro-acoustic album.
0812550706|5.0|I first read this novel back in the mid- to late-80s, shortly after it first came out as a novel (it started as an award-winning novella in 1977). I was absolutely blown away. Maybe it happens when a person comes up through a traumatic childhood, as I did, but seeing a fictional child like Ender tested to such a horrifying degree, and seeing him endure and fight on no matter what the odds, was awe-inspiring.<br /><br />And that's just my review of Orson Scott Card's protagonist. This novel is so much more than just Ender Wiggin. It's a future world populated by believable people and believable events. It's a ruthless world, much like our own, but it's a world that presents hope, even if through a dystopian lens.<br /><br />Ender Wiggin was specially bred into a family of three genius children. For personality reasons, he is the only one of the three that is chosen by the Defense Department to be trained as a soldier in the upcoming and inevitable war with the alien Buggers species.<br />Through snippets of conversations outside of Ender's experience we begin to understand that Ender may be the only human being on Earth that is qualified to save our planet. As the story unfolds, we also learn that for him to grow into his abilities in time, he must be pushed and prodded and, yes, even punished, whatever might be required to temper him into the human weapon that can defeat an interstellar army that outnumbers us ten if not hundreds to one.<br /><br />The training that poor boy Ender endures makes today's video games look like Pong. The action battle sequences are amazing and seem so real that I suspect a version of the author's invented teaching methods are possibly in use at military academies today. I've read this book multiple times over the last twenty-five years, and I expect I'll still be rediscovering its power in the next twenty-five.<br /><br />Read this book, experience its emotional depth and power, and let a master storyteller blow you away with an ending that is without equal.that is without equal.

6300268985|4.0|Ken Russell's extravagant folly LISZTOMANIA is not a movie biography in the manner of his cinematic portraits of such classical composers as ELGAR, Delius (SONG OF SUMMER) and MAHLER. Nor is it a fanciful impression of the artist's inner world in the manner of THE DEBUSSY FILM or THE MUSIC LOVERS.<br /><br />It is instead a comic phantasmagoria which posits Franz Liszt as the world's first pop star at war with rival Richard Wagner, portrayed as a blood-sucking monster-maker and Nazi-prototype bent on World Domination.<br /><br />It's also an utterly silly show designed solely to titillate, offend, outrage and entertain. The leering black masses, gassing asses, vampire orgies and giant dildoes playfully employed are not soon to be forgotten.<br /><br />Rock star Roger Daltry, fresh from the success of Russell's brilliant and outrageous film of The Who's opera TOMMY, throws himself into the part of Liszt with gusto and again proves an appealing movie presence.<br /><br />LISZTOMANIA betrays signs of having been thrown together quickly and comparatively cheaply to catch the wave of TOMMY. The film suffers from a shapeless, arbitrary structure and lack of rhythm and momentum. It's full of bizarre ideas, dazzling set-pieces and a full quota of shocks, but never coheres as an organic whole. The problem is not so much Russell's trademark \\"excess\\" as an uncharacteristically arbitrary, undisciplined  sloppiness, conceptually and in both execution and (especially) editing.<br /><br />Musically, the film offers too little Liszt and too much of Rick Wakeman's electronics. Daltrey's songs, adapted from Liszt, are highlights and the show would have benefited from more of these. LISZTOMANIA is at its best when setting exotic images to music, or music to erotic images, yet here too Russell seems out of control of his powers. (For example, the opening slapstick scene is all but ruined by a ludicrous bluegrass patter song, just when a nasty parody of a Liszt theme is most needed.)<br /><br />Russell might have better followed TOMMY with a restrained film such as his WOMEN IN LOVE, SAVAGE MESSIAH and MAHLER before launching another all-out assault on the senses. LISZTOMANIA was one TOMMY too many, too soon -- a disastrous miscalculation. The film's resounding flop, coming at the peak of his commercial success, was a setback from which Russell never fully recovered. After another expensive bomb (the maligned VALENTINO) his career as a world-class film-maker came to a standstill. With the single exception of ALTERED STATES, Russell never again had access to the lavish financing for which his most of his best feature films are noted.<br /><br />LISZTOMANIA may be a formal mess, but it represents Ken Russell's unbridled insanity in all its glory.<br /><br />Rating: 7/10 ***½ GOOD/><br />Russell might have better followed TOMMY with a restrained film such as his WOMEN IN LOVE, SAVAGE MESSIAH and MAHLER before launching another all-out assault on the senses.

B0034G4P80|5.0|I just got back from seeing Thor and thought it a fantastic yet emotional film, even better than Spider-man 2 or Iron-Man (two other excellent Marvel outings).<br /><br />Plots:<br /><br />I won't go too much into plot summary since that has already been done by other critics and writers on this site.  I will say that the general themes of arrogance and betrayal give way to love and honor in a way that I've only read in the actual Thor comics.<br /><br />Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, many years ago now, created their Marvel version of Norse mythology with Thor -- a brash, arrogant son of the mighty Odin (well-played by Anthony Hopkins).  The comics painted Thor as a man-god in dire need of humility.  And of Loki, adopted son, whose distinctive black hair and clever manner portend the story -- a jealous son who only desires the pride of his father.<br /><br />Father and Son:<br /><br />It has been pointed out that this is a father/son story.  True, but I'd take that a step further and say it's a story of family.  Odin, regardless of being the most powerful being in the Nine Worlds (yes, initial caps!) has two boys to take care of, to groom to be worthy of king.<br /><br />Thor, after screwing up with the Frost Giants' world, is banished to Earth. There we meet Jane Foster, a scientist studying the wormholes she suspects are there, and her friend Darcy who is studying Thor's abs.<br /><br />Humor:<br /><br />There is enough to go around but is certainly not the slapstick humor of the Green Hornet film!  Loki's apparent regard for his father and the build-up of his betrayal was well-played and smooth.<br /><br />Thor's now-depowered body takes a beating and he finally comes to realize his own faults and arrogance.  But his dealings with the hospital staff, his fights with SHIELD, and his growing friendship with Jane, show that he is human after all.<br /><br />Fights:<br /><br />The Frost Giant's battle, the defeat of the guardian of the Rainbow Bridge, Heimdall, and the camaraderie and battle with the other comics characters (Sif, and the Warriors Three) were nearly directly out of the comics story, but it was not \\"comic bookie\\" if you know what I mean.  Not a lot of explosions, just some honest swordplay and kick-butt action!<br /><br />Easter Eggs:<br /><br />Only fans would have spotted a few things that are not a deep part of the story at all, but just a nod to fans.  The first man to try to pull the magical hammer, Mjolnir, from the ground was none other than J. Michael Stracynski, author of this film (whose been writing some great comics scripts lately and is also author of the former TV series, Babylon 5).  Another is the inevitable Stan Lee appearance.  And Jane Foster's former boyfriend (only mentioned,  never seen) is \\"Donald Blake\\" *(which is the comics was Thor's alter-ego).<br /><br />There's a scene after the credits are done.  Be sure you wait for it.  The excellent soundtrack will keep you rocking up to that point.<br /><br />Changes:<br /><br />I really appreciate a film that does not require early comics knowledge to understand what's going on.  I truly feel anyone who enjoys some decent fantasy, with its codes of honor and loyalty will greatly love this film.  There are several changes from the comics, but it does not matter.  It's all good!<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br /><br />Straightforward, not too pretentious.  We get our quota of subtle bad guys, unstoppable forces and immovable objects, and the story moves along without being rushed or having any real boring pauses.  I mean even Thor makes breakfast!  A must-see.<br /><br />Other Marvel Movies for the Marvelites, Past & Possible:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B001GAPC1K Iron Man (Ultimate Two-Disc Edition + BD Live) [Blu-ray]]]<br />[[ASIN:B00005JKC3 Hulk (Widescreen 2-Disc Special Edition)]]<br />[[ASIN:B00005JMQW Spider-Man 2 (Widescreen Special Edition)]]<br /><br />Great Cast!<br /><br />Directed by:<br />Kenneth Branagh<br /><br />Produced by:<br />Avi Arad<br />Kevin Feige<br /><br />Screenwriter:<br />Mark Protosevich<br />Zack Stentz<br /><br />Cast:<br /><br />Tom Hiddleston ...

B0015GDVTU|4.0|`P.S. I Love You' is a strange film in that it manages to be both funny and sad at the same time.<br /><br />When Holly loses her husband, Gerry, to a brain tumour she really struggles to come to terms with her loss.  Then on her 30th birthday she receives the first of many letters from Gerry that he wrote before he died.  These comfort and guide her through her grief and set her back on the path of her life again.<br /><br />This film has some genuinely funny moments, some of which come from Lisa Kudrow, and one minute you will be feeling choked up from a particular scene, only to be laughing in the next.  Swank is ok as Holly and Gerard Butler is good as Gerry, but I have to say one of the stronger performances comes from Kathy Bates, which is no surprise whatsoever as she always is a class actress.<br /><br />This has some wonderful flash backs of Holly and Gerry's early relationship and some of the surprise's he springs on her in the letters are poignant and heartfelt.  This is a bit of a `chick flick' (which is no criticism, more an observation), but it is done very well and despite being a little over-long, it is a touching enough film with an original storyline to keep you interested.  Some parts of this film are superfluous (like Harry Connick Jr's character who could easily be cut with no loss to the film), but I guess they add an extra dimension that would otherwise be lacking.<br /><br />All in all this is an engaging and reasonably emotional film and it's gentleness is offset by it's humour, which makes for an entertaining combination.  This is worth a viewing at some point and makes a nice way to spend a lazy Sunday afternoon.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B00005LQ04|5.0|Currently there is considerable diversity of response to Dario Argento's supernatural masterpiece SUSPIRIA. Admiration and enthusiasm for the film is not nearly as universal as it was twenty years ago, when its reputation skyrocked past the level of a cult item. Viewers younger than myself (and I am a Terrible Old Man) looking for the film's legendary intensity often seem put off by it's nonsensical, campy excessiveness.<br /><br />I think that the camp in SUSPIRIA is deliberate. The casting alone is a clue. Hollywood legend Joan Bennett (of Fritz Lang and DARK SHADOWS fame), Alida Valli (of Welles' THE THIRD MAN and Hitchcock's THE PARADINE CASE), uber-weirdo Udo Kier (ANDY WARHOL'S FLESH FOR FRANKENSTEIN and BLOOD FOR DRACULA), and oddball leading lady Jessica Harper (PHANTOM OF THE PARADISE, SHOCK TREATMENT), all in one movie--and that's just for starters!<br /><br />The whole thing is deliberately and flagrantly baroque, with an overwhelming emphasis on dazzling decor. If Vincente Minnelli, Ken Russell and Mario Bava had teamed up to make a psychedelic Horror film, it might have looked something like this.<br /><br />\\"Over the top\\" doesn't begin to describe the film's outrageousness. It ascends from the weird unreality of Argento's ultra-violent Giallo thriller masterpiece DEEP RED to a new octave of visual, aural and aesthetic insanity. SUSPIRIA is sort of a deadpan response to THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW: a glorious pop-art orgy of color, sound and sensation, designed to drive the viewer to screams, laughter and delerium. The test is not so much \\"can you take the terror?\\" as \\"can you stand the stimulation?\\".<br /><br />Argento's phantasmagorias are not for anyone demanding logic, characterization, or a linear narrative. These are mad, blackly comic dream films with no point of comparison to garden-variety Horror or \\"Scary\\" Movies. Perhaps a background in the Italianate Gothic cinema is a prerequisite to appreciation.<br /><br />Maybe one had to \\"be there\\" to fully succumb to the impact of its unique madness. When it first came out, it was utterly wild; there'd never been anything quite like it.<br /><br />SUSPIRIA is one of my five favorite Modern Horror films. I can't wait to see how Natalie Portman is going to approach the new version, if that ever gets made.<br /><br />Rating: 10/10 ***** Extraordinary.fully succumb to the impact of its unique madness.

B004A8ZX28|3.0|(Not to be confused with a 2006 thriller starring James Caviezel.)    Barely saved from a near-death traffic accident in Berlin, an American traveler Dr. Martin Harris (Liam Neeson) returns to his hotel where his wife Liz (January Jones) stays. To his great surprise, Liz doesn't know him. Not only that; there is another Dr. Martin Harris (Aidan Quinn), who claims HE is the husband of Liz. Something must have happened while the \\"first\\" Martin Harris was in coma for four days, but what could that be?    \\"Unknown,\\" directed by Jaume Collet-Serra (a 2005 \\"House of Wax\\" an \\"Orphan\\"), starts with an intriguing premise, keeps us guessing for quite some time until the final chapter that is slightly underwhelming. To explain how underwhelming is really hard without spoiling much - be assured, no spoilers ahead - but all I can say is, though (or because) everything fits in the right place, the story looks too implausible, or silly at some parts, even by the standards of Hollywood thrillers. (Why didn't Liam Neeson's character just tell Liz where he was going? Or how about his briefcase? How could he be so careless?)    As in a recent hit thriller \\"Taken,\\" Liam Neeson delivers solid acting as the film's confused and disoriented hero. Supports from veterans Bruno Ganz and Frank Langella are also impressive, sharing a brief but tense scene of suspense, though Diane Kruger as a taxi driver is less convincing. There is one effective car chase scene though I am not sure we really need a car chase scene at all.     Well-paced and well-acted, \\"Unknown\\" is a kind of rollercoaster ride that remains entertaining throughout, with actions and surprises, but once it is over, you may not be sure the thriller is really as unique and original as it initially looks.

B003F3NDP8|5.0|Unable to get season 6 of Desperate Housewives at our local blockbuster and wanting to watch it all before viewing season 7, my daughter and I ordered it from Amazon. It arrived quickly and in perfect condition. We had hours of lighthearted entertainment -mother/daughter style- watching our inexpensive purchase without commercials and on our schedule. Thank you women and men of Wisteria Lane.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Went into Guitar center the friday before Mother's Day with my mom and tested the various headphones including beyerdynamic, sennheiser, and sony - the three major contenders.<br /><br />My Mom and I tried them all on and decided the beyerdynamic is slightly more comfortable (you can tell by the picture that the ear cup is good quality stuff) BUT it looked like it got dirty easily and it'd be hard to clean.<br /><br />The Sony was also VERY comfortable. Sennheiser's were quirky but also comfortable. She decided on the Sony's because of comfort, ease to clean. They looked like they were all comparable materials if that says anything about durability. I do not anticipate the ear pads to last longer than 2 years, even for a casual user of 2 hours a day. Even so, they are great quality in terms of sound, comfort, and durability. Ear pads can be easily bought, and I think I'll be picking up a pair for myself. I was eyeing a pair of nice AKG 's, but after having personally tested the Sony I think it would be worth it since I don't want to waste time burning in the AKG's. The Sony's, as far as I could tell, didn't really require a burn in period. Straight out of the box, great quality for casual listeners and professionals.<br /><br />Would highly recommend as the most expensive pair of cans for the casual listener. It's the best quality for the purpose without getting diminishing marginal utility of buck spent per quality for casual cans. The majority of professionals in the field use these, very portable, comes with a bag.
B0043RSIUK|1.0|Ken Follett has always been one of my favorite authors. But with this latest book, Fall of Giants, he has disappointed me. The book is long and slow. It does not have the drama and gripping story lines of his others books. It is the most boring saga I've read in a long time. I hope this is not his new style of writing.

0312370849|5.0|Bought this book on the suggestion of a friend.  Great friend...great book!    I was hooked on this story from the first page.  I loved the character developement & the story was well told.  Sad history, but not one to be forgotten.      I won't get into details, but I did see the ending coming.  I was not disappointed about figuring it out as I loved it.  I actually admit to crying at the end!    Overall, great book.  Really well done.  Highly reccommend this book.
1427206015|1.0|Audio/Abridged:  First, let me say that I really, really love the Plum series. I hate, HATE, the in-between stories, and I don't know why I keep punishing my self with them.  I got this one at the annual Library sale for $3 bucks and I should have bought a pack of cigarettes and killed myself slowly instead. The regular Plum series is so far-fetched anyway, but I let it got b/c it's good story telling.  Stephanie is such a doormat in this series. I found myself yelling at my car cd player. No more.
1593272839|5.0|This book is a great introduction to Haskell and a great introduction to functional programming. The author's casual style helps make some fairly challenging ideas simple to understand. The pace is deliberate but not overly slow. For example, I really appreciated the gradual build-up from functors, to applicative functors, to monoids, eventually moving on to monads. In this sequence, monads were not nearly as scary a topic as they sometimes can be. This is the best resource I've found for learning Haskell all in one place. Now I just need a book as good as this one for continuing my Haskell education.
B000UR9T82|1.0|I bought this item because on  Amazon I could see AUDIO: Englsih, French and Spanish;    I am spanish speaker.  I have the package now,   but with Czech, English, Russian, Polish and Hungarian audio only (even spanish subtitles); the problem is that I can´t send the movies back because I live in Latin America and is very expensive.    This is a fraud,  I have only one option...throw away the films.   I have spent my money on garbage.    COMPRÉ ESTE PAQUETE DE PELÍCULAS PORQUE EN AMAZON DICE QUE TIENE AUDIO EN INGLÉS, FRANCÉS Y ESPAÑOL; MI SORPRESA FUE QUE AL RECIBIR EL PAQUETE SOLO TIENE AUDIO EN CHECO, RUSO, INGLÉS Y POLACO, EN ESPAÑOL NI SIQUIERA SUBTÍTULOS.

B0020EK4QY|1.0|The one star is for the blu-ray edition of this movie, not for the movie itself (which otherwise I consider to be one of the best action movies I have ever seen).     The blu-ray edition is too grainy and has very bad color saturation and low contrast. Worst of all, the digital scenes of air combat with Soviet (Ukrainian) jet fighters are just horrible: blurred sores on screen.     It is a shame that an otherwise fine film like this was released in Blu-ray without making the necessary upgrades to ensure that some scenes would not look like crap when viewed in high definition.     Save your money and wait for a future version of this movie that is properly transferred to a high definition format.

0307236722|5.0|I have been baking since I was a preteen and it was a lot of fun then.  I still enjoy it as a adult.  I baked cakes for my kid's birthdays.  This book has all the information you need to bake all kinds of goodies.  If you're a beginner, this is the perfect handbook in which to learn from.  I'll be using this for years to come!
0553582038|3.0|I agree with many of the other reviewers here, this book is a bit of a slog after the excitement of the first three books. The story is just epically spawling. And I'm also becoming put-off by the heavy, HEAVY grimness - even horror - that overhangs everything. My word, George R.R. Martin makes Stephen King look like Walt Disney! Without Tyrion's wit there's just no relief from the blackness of the story. Cersei might be the most evil, treacherous, loathsome character I ever come across. Alas, there's no sunshine anywhere to be found. Without some breath of joy or happiness to lift the story I find it becoming too oppressive for me to want to continue with. Well written or not, I rather we dispensed with the in-fighting and got to the real battle: the dragons and the Others!
B000687M48|2.0|The only reason I bought this CD is because I didn't realize that it is a concert CD. I detest concert CDs because, as another reviewer stated, all the cheering is really annoying, and I especially dislike it when lead singers stop singing so the crowd can fill in....which happens here. There was nothing on the CD jacket indicating that it was a concert recording, which is ALSO annoying, and now I have wasted my money. I love Evanescence, but not this particular recording.
B004PVKFR8|5.0|AWOLNATION is an unstoppable force of energy and innovation.  In an interview found on YouTube, front man Aaron Bruno dubbed Megalithic Symphony as \\"Danger Pop.\\"  He said \\"if Rage Against the Machine hung out with Justice and then went to a party that Prince was playing at and then had sex with Micheal Jackson and then had tea with The Beatles the next day - that's what I hope we sound like.\\"  An ambitious mix of styles present themselves throughout this album topped off with Bruno's beautifully versatile voice.  AWOLNATION's hypnotic melodies and punch packing lyrics will have you pressing repeat well into the night.  I sense a bright future for this band.
B004EPYZQC|5.0|** PLOT SYNOPSIS (MINUS ENDING)**<br /><br />Vin Diesel is busted out of prison and is reunited with his sister Jordana Brewster (who I fell in love with in D.E.B.S.) and her bf Paul Walker in Rio, the most recognized skyline in the world. They are bad guys stealing cars off a train. As things turned out, these were cars seized by the Brazilian DEA, who for some reason unlike their American counterparts don't disable the vehicles. Due to infighting, the effort is partially botched and Vin Diesel and Walker end up as captives of a Rio mobster. They discover he wants one of the cars back real bad. After they escape they dismantle the car to find out way.<br /><br />Meanwhile Dwayne Johnson comes down from the US to take back Vin Diesel. It seems the US has jurisdiction in Brazil, but hey its a movie. From a chip in the vehicle, Vin Diesel discovers that the crime boss has money stored in various cash houses throughout the city. Walker and Vin Diesel assemble a Mission Impossible team to go after the cash. They attack the first cash house and burn the money which forces the mobster to relocate all his eggs into one basket. As it turns out, that basket is inside the evidence safe at the police station, making the task of that one last hit a bit more difficult. At this point the movie takes a few interesting twists and turns.<br /><br />The plot contains numerous implausibilities as does most Mission Impossible action movies, vehicles that can bust through concrete walls (that never use rebar), and don't even scratch the head lights. The ending will keep Myth Busters busy for a season.

I saw Nikki post a comment to a fan that \\"We are all in this together.\\" This album, muck like \\"The Heroin Diaries Soundtrack\\" is straight from the heart. Nikki, DJ and James put everything that had into this new and amazing collection of songs. If it does not hit you straight into your soul the first time, listen to it again.

0140306013|5.0|This story has amazing characters and a fast-pace plot. The first time I read this story I was a little confused at first, but that is because Adam so thoroughly immerses the reader in the rabbit's culture. While that may sound strange; in fact, it's wondrous and thoroughly engrossing. The rabbit folklore in this story is part of what makes Watership Down unlike other fantasy novels. The characters are heroic, but their heroism is complicated by the fact that they are rabbits and thus are prey to all types of predators. How and why they escape their doomed warren is mystical and dangerous. Hazel's emergence as a leader is gradual and inspiring. This is a story that can be read again and again and will always delight.

B000WCDI5K|5.0|Sawdust is absolutely incredible! This album consists of B-Sides, covers, rarities, remixes, and unreleased material. B-Sides? So many of these songs have full potential to be singles. Songs like Tranquilize (ft. Lou Reid), All the Pretty Faces, Sweet Talk, Leave the Bourbon on the Shelf, and Where the White boys dance not only have catchy tunes, but are VERY well written. Covers of Shadowplay, Ruby Don't Take Your Love To Town, and Romeo & Juliet not only do the originals justice, but possibly better them. Songs like Ballad of Michael Valentine, Glamorous Indie Rock & Roll, & Under the Gun(songs from the rare extended version of Hot Fuss, though under the gun & indie rock & roll are different on this album) are released. Not to mention a divine Abbey Road version of Sam's Town that will leave you breathless. Each of the other songs as incredible qualities as well. This compilation is a MUST for any Killers fan, or good music fan in general.
B004MKM8L8|5.0|I have read all the Harry Potter books and seen all of the movies our so far. This one is not my favorite but still quite a fun movie. Can't wait for the next one.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|Best decision ever!  All of you fanboys out there and purists to the original trilogy, don't you understand that if Lucas had the technology that he has at his disposal today when he made the original trilogy, they will look like what he has today?  Don't you understand that he is always looking for advancement of cinematic technology that will give the best freedoms for the directors, producers and studios to make movies with?  Don't you know that most movies use his production facilities to create and do post production work on their movies?  If Lucas did not listen to the movies executives when he created the original Star Wars trilogy what makes you think that he will listen to you?  His Star Wars Universe is his \\"all rights reserved\\".  Oh, yes, he will listen and take note, but it is up to him to do what he wants to do with HIS universe.  If you wish to purchase the blu-ray then do, then if not then stick to the VHS or DVD of the original trilogy and be satisfied.      If you fanboys and purists of the original trilogy did not listen to any of interviews that he gave and gives he has said that the way that the original trilogy stand are the closest vision that he had for them.  Who knows when new technology comes out that is better that what we have today do you think that he is going to revisit the whole saga and tweak it here and there to bring them closer to his vision for his universe?  Then we are going to have not only the fanboys and purists of the original trilogy and those of the new trilogy all in a tiff same the same thing over again, then what, boycott Lucas Films?      So go and and flex your freedom and purchase this wonderful set and join Lucas in his most complete vision of the Star Wars Saga to date.  Who knows what other material he has jammed into each disc and easter eggs.  Besides we may be funding for Episodes VII, VIII and IX; could it be?
1600242197|5.0|I am a woman who loves to read historical romances. This is not a book I would have even thought to read. A co-worker of my husband suggested he read it and loaned him the book.  I glanced at the back flap and it caught my attention.  I read it in two days. This was about a Special Forces Team (Navy Seals) that went in to take out a target a few years ago. It made me cry and cuss and I wanted to help those quys.  It was written so that I felt like I was there, they were part of my family.  I felt knew them.  I went through their training and met their families.  The book is extremely well written.  The fact that it is real makes it so much more heart breaking but it shows how much our men in uniform and their families give up to protect all of us.  It also shows their mind set of never giving up and their remarkable courage from start to finish.  One of the guys who was killed, Michael Murphy, was was featured on ABC World news today.  It showed where a ship was christen by his mother today, May 7, 2011(the day before Mothers Day).  God Bless our people in uniform and especially our Special Operations Units who would never expect any recognition for the things they do just to protect us.

But when it did end, it was a fitting end. =} Beautifully crafted and superbly written.

B004AUGJS8|4.0|In this thriller slash drama flick based upon a real missing person's case, Ryan Gosling plays David Marks the son of a wealthy real estate magnate in New York who, affected by watching his mother's death when he was 7 years old, loses patience with his wife (Kirsten Dunst, and looks to end their marriage in a very permanent way. His wife clearly comes from a family nothing like the Marks and from the beginning was treated like an outsider.  The senior Marks focuses all of his effort on running his real estate empire and doesn't pay anywhere near enough attention to his son who clearly has been slipping away from him for many years.  Although this crime still hasn't been solved more than 30 years since his wife dissapeared, the amazing thing is that David Marks--as you learn right at the end of the movie--still lives in Florida as a real estate investor.<br /><br />I thought the movie moved along at a pretty decent clip most of the time.  It was somewhat unclear to me towards the end of the story if the events portrayed were in fact where the case stands today or if the screen writers took some liberties with the ending.  Overall a good story and a good secondary lesson for parents who put too much stress on their kids to follow their lead. I recommend this movie as a good Saturday night watch.
B004EPYZP8|5.0|Brad Furman's \\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\" is a slick, fast-moving, outstandingly entertaining legal thriller about a defense attorney burdened with the client from Hell. Mickey Haller (Matthew McConaughey)--known as \\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\" because his office is the back seat of his chauffeured Lincoln Town Car--is an arrogant hotshot who prides himself on being able to play the legal system like Jimi Hendrix played his guitar. After several plot twists and turns, however, Mickey suddenly finds the system playing him. He's even being framed to look like the perpetrator of capital crimes, and because of attorney-client privilege he faces disbarment--or worse--if he tells what he knows.<br /><br />To say anything more about the plot of \\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\" would be a capital crime in itself. Let's just say that the movie keeps you on the edge of your seat literally to the last minute, and that even the savviest thriller fan won't guess all the surprises Furman has in store. Matthew McConaughey hasn't been this good since he played another, very different lawyer in \\"A Time to Kill,\\" and he is matched by an impeccable supporting cast including Marisa Tomei as his prosecutor ex-wife, Ryan Philippe as a rich kid accused of rape, Frances Fisher as Philippe's imperious mother, William H. Macy as a scruffy P.I. and John Leguizamo as a sleazy bail bondsman. Airtight and engrossing, \\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\" is pretty much flawless for what it is.
B004UOCF3W|5.0|I find it difficult reviewing music because I feel  like I must listen to a disc many, many times before I feel justified writing a review. Time seems to be the best test for anything music: Will it stand up years down the line and be memorable? If you listen to a disc years later and it still has that quality and freshness it had years ago, then you know you have a winner... I think the Foo Fighters latest Wasting Light will prove this test of time.     Judging one Foo Fighters album over another isn't easy because you are judging the album as whole and each disc has some favorite tracks within the record. Like many reviewers, I agree that The Colour and the Shape is one of their crowning achievements, and boasts some unforgettable tracks, but Wasting Light holds up very closely to this one, even though they are really from \\"eras\\" as far as rock music.     Wasting Light is a smattering of everything from Dave and company, but is a bit more restrained at points, yet still manages to let you \\"rock out\\". It has a nice mix of hard guitar riffs that we are accustomed to (\\"White Limo\\", Bridge Burning\\") as well as a bit of the \\"old school\\" Foo (\\"Miss the Misery\\") along with more radio friendly and crisp songs that balance everything (\\"Rope\\"), and some deeper thought-provoking tracks (\\"These Days\\", \\"Walk\\").  As far as my favorites, I really loved \\"Bridge Burning\\" , \\"Rope\\", \\"Walk\\" and \\"Miss the Misery.\\" \\"Walk\\" is a fantastic closure and clincher for the disc, with insightful lyrics that seem to personify the group's ability to turn out great music year after year.     In a way, Wasting Light as a whole will probably stand the test of time because it is a more mature album that balances everything, having a little of everything for the Foo Fighters fan, and standing up along the best of them as a whole.     4 ½ stars
0312430000|2.0|This should have been called the \\"Paying Attention Manifesto\\" since it was mostly anecdotes about how paying attention to details can have a positive impact on your work.  Diets work in part because you're \\"paying attention\\" to what you're eating, when and how much; this same principle is basically covered ad nauseum here.  The few examples that weren't about surgery or health care were weak and lacking insight - not that the surgery examples were much better.  I guess Mr. Gawande had never heard of a Gantt Chart by which scheduling is done because he seemed quite surprised that we no longer use \\"master builders\\" to build skyscrapers but rather work as teams using lists.  Gantt charts have been around for decades and in most cases no software or game is designed these days without one.    I am not sure what I expected but this book is long on stories about procedures (as mentioned, especially medical ones) and short on practical applications beside the surgical theater or ICU.  The one or two examples of checklists beyond the basic, \\"do this before this type\\" felt inserted only to justify the book's name. I wish I had been \\"paying more attention\\" when I ordered this book.  Although a competent writer, Mr. Gawande didn't give me enough practical information to recommend this book to any friend.
0553386794|4.0|I just finished re-reading Game of Thrones for the first time in about 14 years, and I'm struck by how tightly wound the narrative is throughout the book.  Told through several different viewpoints, it shows the crumbling of the kingdom as it gives way to several splinters of forces contending through the throne.  It is tense from the outset, as Ned Stark is being forced into a position he never wanted.  The reader can feel Ned's agitation throughout the book at trying to hold together the kingdom while trying to find his way back home.<br /><br />While Ned struggles in his position, there are several whirlpools of intrigue that are rising faster to the surface.  While most of the viewpoints center on the Stark family and the struggle on the mainland, we also get the viewpoint from the princess (Daenerys) of a deposed king.  Martin does a great job of showing how the plot for the throne continues in exile, and by the end of the book it is ominously clear that Daenerys will be a force to reckoned with in short order.<br /><br />Throughout the book-and especially starting 2/3 of the way through the book-there is a sense of coming doom on every page.  Although I'm not a fan of political intrigue, Martin again does a good job of blending political intrigue with mystery and personal conflict.  The Starks are well developed characters, as are Tyrion Lannister and Daenerys.  I'm now curious to see how the HBO series matches up with the book.
B004Q1FDHO|3.0|I've enjoyed this game on my Thunderbolt, but when I loaded it on the Xoom Tablet, it became immediately apparent that this game isn't ready for tablets (despite Amazon's assurance that it was supported).  When shopping for weapons, the forground bitmap is scaled to be so large that you can't select items on the lower racks behind it.    On a small, low DPI screen, it's fun.  I really like the art style and there is enough variety in weapons and fish to keep it interesting for a while.

B002SR2PKG|5.0|There isn't a lot I can say about this book that hasn't already been said.  I just wanted to offer my own experience with it.<br /><br />I started to read this book when I spotted it in my school library when I was 12 years old.  I got to the part where Stan commits suicide and had to just stop.  Something about the idea that a fear of something in his past that has come back to him in the present scaring him so much that he killed himself, scared the crap out of me at that age.<br /><br />It was probably a bit advanced of a book for a 12 year old anyway.  Even one that had tested to have a 12 grade reading comprehension level (do they still test for that?)  I picked the book up again at 15, and got through most of it.  By then, I'd been exposed to a great deal of horror, in both film as well as books.  And since, horror has been my favorite genre of fiction.  I must say that IT remains the scariest book I've ever read.  Nothing gave me nightmares like IT, nothing.  I even developed an intense fear of clowns thanks to Pennywise and his antics.  Even though it waned over time, I still get a little creeped out by clowns.<br /><br />In any case, I'm glad I read this when I was young.  I don't know that I would have been as affected by it as an adult.  I really believe that when you are young it is the time to get into horror.  After all, what really scares you once you know none of it's real anymore?  It was the terror that IT inspired in me when I was young that created my lifelong love of horror.

B0021L8V0M|1.0|I keep hearing how things were simpler \\"back then,\\" but it seems to me the opposite is true.  Sure, the \\"Buck Rogers\\" serial was cheaply made and quite silly, but that was when the talkies were still in black-and-white, and special effects were primitive.  As to \\"Salt,\\" here we have a contemporary, big budget, alleged thriller that is so absurd, it makes the \\"Giant Claw\\" look like a documentary.    In \\"Salt,\\" we see the CIA take ineptness to new levels, unable to corral Ms. Jolie even when she is sealed in a room in a CIA office building, with a SWAT team outside the door.  The clumsy chase scenes lack only Moe, Larry, and Curly.  This movie does not even try.  One gets the idea that even Seal Team 6 would be helpless when faced with a foe of the stature of Ms. Jolie.    Things are sure simpler today.

B001PPLJIQ|5.0|I find the best way to go into a film is to know as little about it as possible. I didn't know a thing about 'The Reader' before buying it on Amazon other than it starred Kate Winslet (who won an oscar) and Ralph Fiennes and Winslet plays yet another character who spends a good portion of a film wearing absolutely nothing and having sex. Sounded like a winning purchase ('Little Children' was a great movie after all). Turns out 'The Reader' is one of the best films I've seen in the last few years. It has a richly layered plot of human drama that hits on the generational attitudes of post-WWII Germany, the Holocaust, and brings up questions of guilt and blame.<br /><br />'The Reader' follows the character Michael Berg, a lawyer in Berlin who's distant with other people, particularly the women in his life. We learn through extended flash-backs that Michael at age 15 secretly carried on an affair with an older woman named Hanna. Along with sexual confrontations Michael and Hanna connect through stories as Hanna asks Michael to read books to her before (and sometimes during and after) their love-making. After the affair ends we follow Michael through college to present day (or 1995 in the movie's terms) and we see how his relationship with Hanna has effected the rest of his life, especially after witnessing a high-profile trial involving the Holocaust with Hanna as a defendant!<br /><br />What makes 'The Reader' work so well for me is that it doesn't provide any easy answers or solutions for it's characters. Michael is constantly confused and trying to understand, not just the actions of other characters in the film but his own emotions as well. Every decision he makes has a lasting impact on his life and this is perfectly realised in the story.<br /><br />As much as I love this film I do have two major complaints. No doubt anyone who's read Bernhard Schlink's book (also titled 'The Reader' on which this movie is based) knows a certain twist involving Hanna's character in the middle of the film. While this reveal is made obvious early on it's still treated as a major plot-twist through Michael's eyes and the montage really wasn't necessary.<br /><br />The other element that didn't strike true is the handling of the impact of the Holocaust. Despite being a major theme, the Holocaust is very much under-played throughout the movie and for the most part this is successful (and I loved how the uncomfortable confrontation between Ralph Fiennes and Lina Olin played out in the end). It was however very hard to get a grasp on the true horror of Hanna's actions, despite some emotional character reactions. Even Michael's walk through an abandond concentration camp didn't give weight to the heavy emotions the character must've been feeling. The audience is still treated as an outsider.<br /><br />Lots of praise for 'The Reader' comes from the performances of it's main three actors. Kate Winslet has always been a high-profile actress and in my opinion has never been better portraying Hanna from her mid-thirties to elderly age towards the end of the story. Ralph Fiennes is equally good playing a man who's been haunted his entire life by his past and the decisions he's made. Screen legend Bruno Ganz is given a great role as Michael's Law-teacher and he's excellent! Perhaps the best performance of the film, though is by unknown actor David Kross who plays Michael from age 15 to 18 (where most of the film takes place). Watching him change from naive boy to young adult coming to terms with some harsh realizations really commands your attention.<br /><br />Despite some complaints, 'The Reader' gripped me and held my interest from beginning to end. I was absolutely mesmerized by this film and I very much recommend it to anyone who likes good human-drama as well as movies about Germany's attitudes towards the Holocaust.<br /><br />(For like-movies check out: Europa Europa, The Tin Drum, The Unbearable Lightness of Being, and The Pianist.)lm.

B003UESJH4|5.0|Tom Hooper is making a name for himself directing period films in a meticulous and creative style, and \\"The King's Speech\\" is a striking example. Like \\"The Damned United\\" (2009), this is a compelling true story about a powerful man struggling with the burdens of his own personality -that takes a few more liberties with history than may have been necessary. The screenplay was written by David Seidler, who suffered from a stammer as a boy and was inspired by King George VI's struggle with the same affliction. Some critics have said that the King's stammer is exaggerated in the film, but the more significant historical inaccuracies are found in subplots concerning King Edward VIII's abdication and the King's views of an increasingly belligerent Germany.<br /><br />King George VI's personal struggle is affecting and a pleasure to watch, however. The film begins in 1925, when Prince Albert, Duke of York (Colin Firth), fails miserably to address a crowd Wembley Stadium due to his stammer. It ends in 1939, when King George VI must announce Great Britain's entry into war with Germany in a radio address to the nation and the world. In between, we observe the Duke's -later King's- relationship with unconventional Australian speech therapist Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush), a elocutionist with no formal credentials who helped shell-shocked soldiers recover their speech after World War I. Logue understood that stammers and stutters had emotional sources and developed techniques to help his patients overcome their fears.<br /><br />Lionel Logue's diaries were recently located, but only a couple of months before filming began. Some authentic dialogue was added to the script, but the personal interactions between the King and Logue are mostly speculation. Some of it strains credibility, like the swearing sessions and Logue calling the King \\"Bertie\\". I could have done without these particular clich&eacute;s. But the visual style and performances of Colin Firth, as the King, and Helena Bonham Carter as his wife Elizabeth are fantastic. As sympathetic as they are witty. King George VI had the misfortune to become a monarch unexpectedly during the brief period when Kings addressed the nation on live radio, while he suffered from a stammer. And it became his duty to overcome that flaw.<br /><br />The DVD (Weinstein 2011): \\"Speeches for the Real King George VI\\" allows us to listen to 2 real speeches, made 5 1/2 years apart, including one we see in the film. \\"The Real Lionel Logue\\" (10 minutes) interviews his grandson Mark Logue about his grandfather and the information in his diaries. \\"Q&A with Director and Cast\\" (22 min) is a question and answer session with Tom Hooper, Colin Firth, Helena Bonham Carter, Guy Pearce, and Claire Bloom. \\"The King's Speech: An Inspirational Story of an Unlikely Friendship\\" (24 min) interviews the cast about their roles and the director about the story and characters. The audio commentary by director Tom Hooper is constant and informative. He addresses his decisions scene by scene, production design, locations, score, period details, performances, and more.

B003ZSJ212|3.0|Unfortunately, the Complete Star Wars Saga sequence has been spoiled for me. I didn't enjoy episodes 1-3 when they came out like episodes 4-6, but episodes 4-6 do look better than ever. The entire story doesn't seem to flow the way it should, due to the limited technology available when the original episodes were filmed. They just look too different. I also expected more extras in this box set. I've still got the first digitally remastered VHS Gold set and I hope my old deck doesn't break down.
0062060554|2.0|I had high hopes for this book to be a real nail-biter, edge-of-the-seat kind of thriller, that's what the testimonials and the promotional materials bill it as.  Unfortunately for me it didn't live up to the hype.<br /><br />I will say that it was easy to read and I read it in one day, eagerly anticipating the ending.  However, what makes this story work is Watson's manipulation of reality in order to prolong the suspense.  If the story had been more well grounded and believable I would have given it higher marks.<br /><br />There were just too many things that had to conveniently fall into place in order to make this story work up to the climax and then the ending was far too neat for reality.  There are a handful of things that feel like puzzle pieces forced to fit in order to make this story work and in the end it just wasn't that clever or well thought out.<br /><br />If you are looking for a clever nail-biter, edge of your seat type of book I recommend Lisa Unger's [[ASIN:0307388999 Beautiful Lies (Vintage Crime/Black Lizard)]] and the follow up story [[ASIN:0307338495 Sliver of Truth: A Novel]].

B002VR9QY6|5.0|The other reviewers in rating this production as 5 Star, as I have, have commented about this classic ballet up, down, backwards and sideways.  In short this beautiful ballet, as an example of the art of ballet, has been fully explored.  To a viewer, seeking reasons why he/she should buy or pass on this ballet performance gains nothing by my adding another dollop to a full plate of praise.  Instead, I focus on the Ballerina: the raison d'etre - the primary reason why you and I buy a ballet recording .      Ballet is a unique intellectual, artistic confection.  It is an art form which tells a gripping story to the viewer (if successfully done) within a highly confining artistic format:  the ballerina, and all the performers, must participate in the telling of a story WITHOUT UTTERING A WORD!  Current Emotions, and Anticipatory Emotions must be expressed (a) through an understanding of the art of mime, (b) the ability to perform effectively in this unique art form (c)in concert with the underlying music, and (d) all coordinated within  a pattern of  intricate dance steps and physical movements, - some requiring a large order of physical strength (e)a memory for detail and (f) an exquisite sense of timing, namely to understand, and obey the choreographer's work product. For it is the choreographer who takes all these disparate elements, and, if successful, melds them into an eye catching, heart warming whole.  All this expository material said, I turn to my reason for writing this review.  I've fsllen in love with Anna Tsygankova, a Queen among the of Giselles!  I knew nothing of Anna until a few days earlier. I had seen her for the first time in this same Dutch Ballet Company's version of Don Quichot.  I marveled at her dancing skills, and enjoyed her effervescent personality.  However her role as Kitri was a comic role, which Ms. Tsygankova carried off very well. It wasn't until I viewed her in this DVD of Giselle that I saw the full range of her artistry.  Her dancing and miming in Don Quichot were superb.  But in this performance of Giselle the interrelationship of her dancing and her miming were exquisite! And essential, were the ballet's love story to be effectively told.  Each art form, dancing and miming,  as done by Anna, buttressed the other, creating a beautiful, heart rending, indelible performance of an old, but ever young romantic ballet. Bravo Anna, Star Ballerina!  Anna Tsygankova you have brought me much pleasure! Thank you!. King Arthur. Arthur Stanley Katz, May 7, 2011
B002ZG980U|2.0|I just thought this was dreary. The mystery of it all is intriguing enough at first, and the special effects are amazing, but then, well, you find out what there is to find out and I thought it was depressing.      I got a copy, buying blind, to save myself the video rental hassle should I want to re-watch repeatedly, but wound up giving it to the library.
B0016K40KY|5.0|It's the best epic movie ever made!     Yet, hardly any of the scenes portrayed in the movie ever took place in the manner that they actually took place.     Regardless, if you want to learn anything about the man, T.e. Lawrence without extensive reading, start here. If you want to learn something about the war in the desert during WWI, start here. If you want to learn something about the great personalities of the war in the desert, start, here.    If you want to learn something about how really great movies are truly made, study this film. If you want to really learn about how truly great musical scores for movies are prepared start here. In fact, the music from this movie is still played by many of our great symphony orchestras to this day.    This is what makes \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" the greatest movie ever made. The collector's set illuminates how it was done...one of the greatest accomplishments of American film.
0345522478|4.0|Have to say that I really enjoyed this book, as it's not every day that you read about a centuries old Druid kicking some Celtic arse! :)<br /><br />Really liked Atticus, who didn't seem world-weary despite being centuries old. He seemed pretty level-headed, and just wanted to be left in peace to live out the remainder of his life. Also loved his Irish wolfhound, Oberon. They have a great relationship, and seem to be real friends as well. Funny to be best friends with a wolfhound, but guess the same could be said of being friends with a Druid.<br /><br />Atticus is living in Arizona because there aren't too many gods or fairies there. Something about a lack of gateways, as oak, ash, and thorn trees are in short supply in the desert. He runs an occult bookstore and makes a decent living seeling rare books online. All is well until an old enemy tracks him down. Atticus is tired of running and hiding, so a last stand is in order.<br /><br />The Irish mythology was interesting, as I'm not really familiar with the various Celtic gods. There's a pronunciation guide at the beginning of the copy I received, but explanations before the book even begins worry me, so I tend to skip them. If I need a scorecard to keep track of all the players, then it's probably not the book for me. Felt the author did a good job of explaining who the various gods were without breaking the story's rhythm, so I never felt lost when The Morrigan or Flidais showed up. Nice job, Kevin!<br /><br />Gave this one a 4/5 as I really liked the characters and the interaction between them, thought the plot made sense, it was well paced, and I got a kick out of the epilogue.  Kevin Hearne is a talented writer with a great imagination, and I'm looking forward to Hexed, the next book in the Iron Druid Chronicles!
1594202842|3.0|Amy Chua's Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother might well be the most entertaining work of nonfiction that I've read this year. This law professor relates how she has raised her children to achieve and excel through discipline, monitoring and constant badgering, and tells that story in an engaging, humorous and entertaining fashion. Parents will agree, disagree, admire or disparage her child rearing methods. In many respects, that's beside the point. We live in relationship with others, and this book tells of the family relationships and the dynamics of love and care that play out in everyday interactions. By the time the dogs arrive on the scene, I was mesmerized. Any reader who likes to peek over the fence at what the neighbors are up to will be well-entertained by what goes on in the Chua household.<br /><br />Rating: Three-star (Recommended)

B002ZG98FU|4.0|Been a long time since I've seen a high-profile ensemble production that works. So many have promised what Morning Glory delivered. I won't recount the failures, misfires and plain suckfests that came before, because that only detracts from this great film.<br /><br />It's been, what, 18 years since '[[ASIN:0783219571 The Paper]]'? That's how long it's been since I've really enjoyed a movie from this collaborative genre.<br /><br />'Glory' opens with a spunky young producer from a small local affiliate, tapped to become the youngest person to lead a national morning show. Her task: Fix the ratings of the floundering program, starting with bringing to heel old school and former anchor Harrison Ford from the world of serious journalism to the puffy vacuous existence of chunky weathermen, cooking healthy omelettes and fake smiles. All while trying to balance a cast of equally crazy, childish and demanding egocentric personalities - and lest we forget - find love.<br /><br />Excellent filmmaking, hitting the right notes at the right moments. Everyone, and I mean every single cast member, couldn't be more right on the money with their performances.<br /><br />Ford's evolution from a hardwired old-school newsman into a guy that maybe sees his future through a different lens - is smooth, funny, and confidently sublime.<br /><br />And one of the very few films I can say that I enjoyed Diane Keaton. Her continual antagonistic feminism always butchers the films roles she's offered. I realize that she has worked hard to overcome the welcome mat image of her early career, but her decades long battle to swing the pendulum the other way has meant her performances are typically nothing more than angry self-absorbed ideology masking itself as acting. This toned-down version of herself was a considerable relief to say the least. Please Ms. Keaton - more of this and less of the gesticulating skreeching bitch.<br /><br />Absolutely loved Rachel McAdams - she is this generation's Julia Roberts - and we're all the more fortunate for it. Feisty, clever, smart and and oh-so-easy on the eyes. I can't get enough of her bright personality. Cannot wait to see her next project.Roberts - and we're all the more fortunate for it.

B004UOCF3W|5.0|I am a big Pearl Jam, Led Zeppelin, Blind Melon, RHCP, ect fan.  Gotta say this is is a great album.  Other than White Limo and Rosemarie (good song, just repetitive for me for some reason); great album.  Not a big Foo Fighters fan historically, like some of their music, only purchased 1 album before. Tough to not compare them to Nirvana, which, looking back, slightly overrated for all the hoopla (spell check!).    Ecstatic about the purchase.  Absolutely one of my favorite albums.
B000003S09|5.0|I am 21 years old. I live in a college dorm with a roommate who, previous to our friendship, had heard precious little of anything other than stuff off the current top 40. Into his life I brought a record player, massive speakers, and a plethora of classic albums I have loved since my dad showed them to me.    I picked up a vinyl copy in a record store downtown one day (the cover art REALLY blows you away when its that big) and we spent an afternoon listening to this album at massive volume. He was struck with a serious case of \\"oh my GOSH, I have never heard anything like this\\" syndrome. And this album is 41 years old. If you want to be taken on a dark otherworldly journey, make sure you don't just listen to it while you're doing something else. Take time and actively listen, in the dark. Everything on this album is GREAT. Moonchild makes TOTAL sense when listening to it in this context. Savor this.

Once the melodies stop seeming arbitrary and you realize the incredible cohesiveness of each song's structure, then you can learn the words. Once you have that, start getting wowed by the instrumentation. Now you are an addict. You play it every day. You discover new sounds on it every day. You become a fan of a band you hitherto had considered a product of preppy white boy disgustingville.
0345522478|5.0|(This review was originally posted at VampireBookClub.net)<br /><br />Diving into the world Kevin Hearne crafted in Hounded was a treat. When you read as much urban fantasy and paranormal novels as I do, you tend to find commonalities constantly. But Hounded felt completely fresh with twists on magic and mythology that demanded attention and often left me grinning.<br /><br />Atticus O'Sullivan is a 2,100 year-old druid. He's mortal, but by learning magic and making nice with a goddess or two, he's managed to avoid death. He has fused iron to his aura protecting him from all but the biggest and baddest fae and gods. He can still die, which is why he's spent centuries staying away from an old Irish love god. He has an ancient item that could help bring about war, and he'd sure like to keep it in his possession. But what happens when the gods start taking up sides and place Atticus, his dog, the local werewolves and his new life in Tempe, Arizona, in the middle? Bloody battles, colluding with potential enemies and working with and against witches to stay alive.<br /><br />There's a hint of royal espionage to the tone in Hounded as various gods reach out to Atticus -- either to use him or to kill him. He has to play their political games and indulge their questions about the world (like, just how does a blender work). Those around him are used as pawns to force Atticus' hand, but the beauty to a hero that's more than 2,000 years old is he's a determined and brilliant guy. He's not easily fooled. (Though maybe a bit paranoid.)<br /><br />If you read this blog often enough, you'll know I appreciate urban fantasy authors who can appropriately inject humor into what could otherwise be a very dark novel (think: Jeaniene Frost, Kim Harrison and newbie Allison Pang). Hearne does this deftly. His hero Atticus has worked his magic mojo to enable him to communicate with his Irish Wolfhound named Oberon. While they can talk mentally, Oberon is still a dog. So, he'll be happy to tell you he likes someone simply because they rub his belly. The dog gets fixated on Genghis Khan and Atticus indulges him because it's a fun dalliance for them both. Maybe I like this so much because I have a hound dog at home, too, and I think he'd behave far too much like Oberon. But I think it's more a lightness and a friendship that helps keep Atticus grounded and someone to relate to, despite the 2,100-year age gap.<br /><br />Hearne's writing is witty, his plot engaging and his protagonist the kind of guy you'd want to grab a pint with. Hounded is a treat, and with the rapid-fire releases of the second and third Iron Druid Chronicle titles -- Hexed and Hammered in June and July respectively -- it won't be long until we get more. We suggest pre-ordering the next two as you pick up Hounded. Really, you'll want more.<br /><br />Sexual content: One brief, no details sex scene

B004NYQYNQ|4.0|I absolutely loved 19 with the exception of first love.  Knowing that I was so excited to get 21.  I was a tad nervous because listening to the samples on amazon I wasn't totally in love but figured I liked her enough to support her.  I have been listening to it nonstop all day.  The stories she tells are phenomenal and being a young person in the 80s I was completely worried about covering The Cure's Lovesong but her version is lovely.  If you're expecting the same sound as 19 you may be slightly disappointed but if you have aged during the time from release of 19 to release of 21, I think you will really enjoy.  I loved the jazzy, soulful sounds and her power.  I recommend purchasing and taking time to listen.  Turning Tables, Rolling in the Deep, Set Fire to the Rain, among others really impressed me.
B004OBQDH0|4.0|Although from the picture it looks taller, the Dobby bookend is a shade over 5\\" tall and not weighted. It holds up the DVD(s) through the means of a thin plastic base- a flimsy,thin piece of plastic. As to be expected it was manufactured in China where most cheap,crummy and sometimes dangerous products are being manufactured these days. That said, it  is a fair representation of the character. For those who care, the DVD case is a shade larger than the other DVDs in the series. The DVD itself played without hitches so no complaints there. All in all I am satisfied with the product.

B004LL1HM4|5.0|When Fleet Foxes released their first disc a few years ago, I thought \\"wow, what potential!\\". The sound was amazing, but the songs themselves seemed like they were half-finished. With \\"Helpnessness Blues\\", they have shown that they know what they want to do, and it is wonderful. I'm sure twenty-somethings react to the music differently than a 57-year-old like me. The Beach Boys were the first music that I can say I loved as a kid. That distant echo of them and CS&N in Fleet Foxes' sound floored me, but they took that and are going their own way with it. On this new disc, the songs sound like real songs. Take the opener \\"Montezuma\\" - it is bold and dramatic, but like a whisper instead of a shout. They are not afraid to experiment, like ambitious bands from the '60s did. Not everything \\"works\\". Some of the transitions can be \\"clunky\\", and the \\"freaky\\" fade-out of \\"An Argument\\" may grate on you. I am not going to fault them for being adventurous. Guy please keep it up.

I would love to see it now in IMAX 3D, but from what I've read IMAX will not be showing it again.  What a shame.    I loved the way it was made, it was so remarkable and so unbelievable. I also think the extra scenes made it more understandable and more enjoyable for me.  I don't think I'll ever get tired of watching it.

It is just perfect to me in length and it has a range of songs. Although it is glossy and sounds polished the guitar is excellent in this. The end is brilliant and it has a good start.<br /><br />The only thing I hated was ASK ME ANYTHING. Yes, you were a coconut for adding that horrible song to the album.

(In addition, shipping was fairly quick with no other issues).
B004R10L4S|1.0|The reason for this review is that the time out of your life for this horrible movie would be a shame. I am saving countless people from drivel.  The real plame story is amazing, and you should take the time to read the accounts of it, not this movie.  The movie has more contempt for the audience than a skin flik.  The director creates the outer trappings of a wonderfully exciting suspenseful movie.  However it never gives the viewer suspense or excitement and fails completely, instead reminding me of Michael's improv class in the Office.  The only exception would be if you turned off the voices ( and didnt turn on English subtitles ) and instead called a friend and watched the movie with only the music but not the words in one of your ear plugs with your friend on the other earplug.      Why? The story is never communicated as it really happened, so even if you know of the Plame affair, the director gave up a great real life story to maintain the cheap attempt of a cliche ridden suspenseful movie that never delivers at all.   So does this mean you get another story? No.  That's what makes this a big zero- the story is incomprehensible because there is none to be culled from the move itself.  Worst off, when what should count for suspense starts, you know what will \\"kind\\" of happen scene by scene as soon as you see the first 5 seconds of every scene, but no story still ever evolves. Whenever content is approached, it gives way to the opposite= to a vague allusion of what you are never told.  What could be worse than this?   Answer: everything else about the movie.  The characters emotions are ingested by us as totally contrived and faked and the viewer at every moment is thinking how a tenth grader making a movie is trying to add drama.    The actors are possibly good actors except the extent of the emotions is what you would expect from the Navy seals as they are about to enter Pakistani air space, too overreaching for what the actors are experiencing which is about at the level of what a viewer would experience were he/she to feel were he/she in a bad job feeling he/she was a month away from being fired.
0060558121|5.0|The day before Shadow is due to be released from prison, he's called to the warden's office. His wife, Laura, is dead.<br />Released, and on his route home to Laura's funeral, he encounters a strange old man who calls himself Wednesday. Wednesday--who claims to be a god--knows more about Shadow than he possibly should, and Shadow, reluctantly, agrees to work for him. Led by Wednesday, Shadow is taken on a profoundly strange journey across the USA. A journey to help Wednesday recruit fellow gods, mythical figures and culture heroes to his side of the oncoming storm: a battle of truly epic proportions.<br /><br />There is something totally unique about Gaiman's writing: instantly recognisable; utterly charming; deceptively simplistic, when it's anything but. American Gods is no exception. It's brilliant, beautiful, and profoundly strange. The story starts off in a oddly detached fashion. For a while I wondered about this, until I learnt more about Shadow. You're experiencing the world through his lens, and detached is exactly what he is. With his wife's death, he's shocked into numbness. When he learns of a painful betrayal on her part, that numbness crystallises, leaving him encased in a protective shell he wears as goes about what's left of his life. Nothing--and I mean nothing--shocks the guy anymore, as it never reaches his core. Nothing can shock him more than what he experiences in the opening chapters of the story.<br /><br />\\"This isn't about what is,\\" said Mr Nancy. \\"It's about what people *think* is. It's all imaginary anyway. That's why it's important. People only fight over imaginary things.\\"<br /><br />In addition to Shadow's tale, we also get glimpses into the back-story of other characters, with a chapter here and there telling the story of an immigrant to America arriving, and bringing their gods with them, or following one of the numerous gods who make up the story. Gaiman's take on folklore, cultural stories and myth is extraordinary, and it grounds American Gods in a world that is tantalising familiar; one of stories and tales you recognise, you have heard, you've known, your whole life.<br /><br />American Gods is a long story, and at times is confronting, meandering, fast-paced, slow-paced, funny and witty, deeply philosophical, or utterly absurd (which, of course, is Gaiman at his very best). It's not always an easy read, but it's a very satisfying one. I loved it, and it's a story I can't imagine having been written of anyone less than Neil Gaiman. And it poses the question: in a world embracing modern technology, yet still deeply a product of a rich past, do we embrace our past as a part of our future, or do we push it aside and become a world of McDonald's, Starbucks and chain stores? Is there room for both our past and our future in our changing world?t is tantalising familiar; one of stories and tales you recognise, you have heard, you've known, your whole life.

B0009HKH6Q|3.0|Who has not dreamt of living the high life, being rich, famous, powerful and beautiful with the world at your feet, and with a penchant for achieving the impossible?  \\"The Thomas Crown Affair\\" provides for all this enchantment and more.  Starring a young and very athletic-looking Steve McQueen and an &uuml;berly sexy Faye Dunaway, it is a film that allows us a look into the life of the rich during the \\"swinging 60's\\".<br /><br />McQueen stars as Thomas Crown, an extremely shrewd, rich and powerful businessman to whom nothing is impossible.  After planning the bank robbery of the century, he gloats in the glory of his own triumph for no other purpose than the sake of the challenge in itself.  But soon he faces his true match, both in wit and brains, in Dunaway, who in the role of insurance investigator Vicki Anderson will give him the run of his life.  The two get entangled into a scheme of cat and mouse, dangerous but incredibly seductive.  Dunaway uses all her powers of seductive mischievousness to get her man in the famous chess scene.  Wearing a backless, pleated mini-dress, inch-long eyelashes and the longest of nails, she check-mates Thomas Crown in a way that he is obviously not used to.  The move makes him fall for Vicki instantly, even though he very well knows that she is after his head.<br /><br />This is a film with great quality of photography, where every scene has been carefully studied and could be used as a \\"magazine layout\\", to use the words of style expert Nina Garc&iacute;a, especially in the scenes where Faye Dunaway appears.  She is always superbly dressed and even more impeccably groomed.  Her hair, make-up - always featuring the inch-long eyelashes and the long, cream-coloured nails - her stylish suits, perfectly accessorized, are a true testament to the style of the era.  Just like Thomas Crown tells her during an auction, she looks as if she has just sprung out of the pages of Vogue.<br /><br />As far as plotlines go, the film does not provide for a very good one.  In fact, at times I found it confusing and hard to follow, even after watching it several times.  It is unclear as to how Thomas Crown is able to pull this most ingenious robbery in the first place, why everyone would trust him at face value (and not even that, as the men he hires to execute the robbery for him do not even know who he is), as well as to how Vicki arrives at the conclusion that he is the culprit (basically, she just looks at a picture of him and decides he is The One).  Even the dialogues are too simplistic.  Nevertheless, the film is worth watching as it provides for some very high class entertainment, and a lesson in how to forge one's own sense of style.at times I found it confusing and hard to follow, even after watching it several times.

You have risked everything to be true to yourself.  You have my agnostic blessings.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|Mumford and Sons make highly original music rooted in the appealing traditions of American bluegrass and English folk. Well-produced arrangements support the evocative and thoughtful lyrics. Somehow, they remind me of the Beatles in that their music is complex and melodic and very catchy and the content of the lyrics has a depth that is revealed through many listenings. And it is almost impossible NOT to rock out to some of the faster tracks, ie. \\"Little Lion Man\\", \\"Roll Away Your Stone\\".  \\"Awake My Soul\\"is moving on more than one level. Great album. I've purchased two already and may keep finding friends to give it to.
B004IQMXD4|5.0|I was a child of the 80's. I recently have listened to Nazareth, Steve Earle, and Robbie Robertson.  Seems 2011 is year major 80's artists come back, but Stevie's creativity, and strength is way ahead of those dudes!<br /><br />Listening to Stevie Nicks new album is an experience; it is exciting, mysterious, and as fun as it was to be a kid listening to Stevie way back when.  It is beyond words how great this new material is from her.  What the hell?  Who is this creative 3 decades later?  She has an incredible ability to transcend time in her music, without comprising who she is.<br /><br />Wow.

B0034G4P8A|5.0|By all rights this movie should be a huge flop.  It's essentially a costume drama set in modern day, a sword- and-sorcery-in-the-stone epic with Thor as Arthur and Mjolnir as Excalibur. But much to my surprise, Thor is a hilarious monster-bashing fish-out-of-water tale with a six-foot-tall chiseled Viking at its center.<br /><br />There's so many things about Thor that shouldn't work but do: he wields a hammer that boomerangs back into his hand, that he can spin at high speed to whip up a whirlwind, that allows him to fly, and that can only be wielded by someone worthy.  This is a hammer we're talking about.<br /><br />There are some concessions to make the film palatable to non-comic fans, but they are surprisingly few.  Thor (chiseled-from-rock Chris Hemsworth) has no alter ego -- although the film takes a stab at creating a hilariously useless cover identity for him that matches his disabled persona in the comics; Asgard is meticulously explained as a highly advanced scientific civilization from the stars; and a considerably diminished Thor returns to Earth.  But everything else - the epaulets, the bright red cloak, the \\"forsooth\\"s and \\"thou\\"s -- are all here in their glorious cheesiness.<br /><br />Director Kenneth Branagh knew exactly what he was doing when he collared Anthony Hopkins as Odin, Rene Russo as Frigga, and Natalie Portman as astrophysicist Jane Foster. Branagh makes Thor palatable by highlighting the very ridiculous nature of it all. Thor gets run over, tasered, and beaten up multiple times to demonstrate that Thor is learning a lesson of humility. And who doesn't want to see a gorgeous white alien (a Nordic?) with bulging muscles get a great big heaping of humble pie?<br /><br />The action flickers back and forth between Asgard where Loki (a sneering Tom Hiddleston) and frost giants plot Asgard's downfall, and Earth where Foster struggles to convince everyone that large, sustainable Einstein-Rosen bridges are real.  This conveniently explains the Bifrost Bridge, because both titles have the word bridge in it.  Although Foster has been upgraded from her role as a nurse in the comics to an astrophysicist in the movie, her scientific contribution is solely to complain about the government taking her analysis equipment, make goo-goo eyes at Thor, and look pretty. If there's a flaw in this movie it's that Foster's relationship with Thor is too brief. It's hard to believe an Asgardian deity would swear to return to defend Earth solely because of one dreamy night spent on a rooftop gazing at the stars. Then again, I just used the words \\"hard to believe\\" and \\"Asgardian deity\\" in the same sentence.<br /><br />There are a host of ancillary characters and all of them provide humorous contributions. There's dour Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) who grabs a bow instead of a sniper rifle; warrior maiden Sif (Jaimie Alexander) and the Warriors Three (Josh Dallas as Fandral, Tadanobu Asano as Hogun, and Ray Stevenson as Volstagg) who are described as \\"Jackie Chan, Robin Hood, and Xena\\"; and best of all there's Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings) a political science major intern (\\"the only one who applied,\\" mutters Foster) who knows nothing about Nordic myth and mishears \\"Mjolnir\\" as \\"meow-meow.\\"  That line still cracks me up.<br /><br />Thor is essentially what happens if a Dungeons & Dragons character walked off a character sheet and stepped onto Earth for a jaunt. I learned a lot about how to correctly pronounce Nordic phrases I've been mispronouncing for two decades, learned absolutely nothing about Einstein-Rosen bridges, and loved every minute of it.  With its clever mix of drama, myth, and superhero sensibility, Thor knocks it out of the park...with a hammer.titles have the word bridge in it.

B004R0WKNE|1.0|I knew I was stuck with a bad movie when Rachel McAdams character was hired by IBS.  The plot from there was predictable, and you know how it is going to end.  Sorry to spoil the ending, but there is no twist or anything unexpected.  This was a waste of film talent, that they tried to spice up with sexual content, but still ended up being boring and predictable.  Americans are smarter than this, we know a bad movie when we see one.  This movie also shows Hollywood narcism, \\"look we have hard and complicated jobs to do\\".  \\"We are under such pressure to perform.\\"  Etc.  Producing/directing/acting is not that complicated compared to the jobs real Americans have.

History and 'feel good' all in the same picture.
B00402FGE4|5.0|Initially, I was under-whelmned with the broadcast episodes.  In part, nothing ever got resolved within an episode, instead each episode ended with a cliff-hanger.  The show just seemed dreary.  Moreover, I did not immediately &#34;take&#34; to the characters.  In most series characters develop over several seasons.  When viewers have become invested in the characters, then the character-heavy episodes begin to become frequent, usually in the third season of a series.  SGU was character-heavy from episode 1---which is simply not interesting if you don't like, and don't care about, the characters.<br /><br />Viewing the DVD version, 3 or 4 episodes at a time, is an entirely different experience.  Events develop and become satisfyingly resolved.  After having seen the entire season (or series) several times, you've become invested with the characters, so they matter to you, so the story becomes a much richer experience.<br /><br />I'd have to say that I like SG1 and SGA more than SGU.  Yet SGU stands up to re-veiwing better than SG1 or SGA.  Although I love the weird aliens, strange worlds, bizzare astro-physical phenonmena, and battles in space---once you've seen an SG1 or SGA episode several times, it begins to get a bit thin.  In contrast, SGU grows on you.  For me, SGU is like &#34;The Fifth Element&#34; or &#34;Blade Runner&#34;---it doesn't matter that I know the story, and have probably seen the movies 20 times each.  The story is so well told, that it just gets richer with each viewing.<br /><br />&#62; Click on “Stoney” just below the product title to see my other reviews, or leave a comment to ask a question.
B003OF3R0S|5.0|This is an awesome album, the drum work, the guitar work, and Shadow's sound better then ever! The guitar solo's are beautiful. Despite it beign an amazing album its also a sad album too, I wished Jimmy wouldn't have passed on, such talent. My favorite song on this album is \\"So Far Away\\". And I say them at the Nightmare After Christmas Tour, so I good they really are, they sound amazing. I have to say the most heaviest song on here is \\"God Hates Us\\" harks back to Waking The Fallen, and Sounding The Seventh Trumpet. I have to say, I love this album overall, there are songs I like better then others, but all of the songs are amazing, by any musicianship standard, don't listen to the negative reviews, this is a masterpiece!

B003ZSJ212|5.0|Finally STAR WARS is on Bluray, but is it anygood, well it depends if you let those minor tweeks get to you, and if you don't, your in for a treat! First of all, the packaging on these movies is superb, kind of reminds me of the packaging for the AVATAR Extended Edition, but better. The artwork that they used was awesome, each movie in the boxset has it's own distinct cover to depict a significant event in that movie! Alright down to the main course!  THE PHANTOM MENACE 4/5. Why give it a high rating? Because I think it delivers a very good story, and the character design, and tech is top notch, granted the Gungan's are very annoying, but other then that great movie, it tells Anakin's origin's, and it show's Kenobi's master, and then there is one of the most awesome villians in the STAR WARS universe, Darth Maul, unfortunately hardly in the movie though. And they put a CGI Yoda in this one, very much appreciated. And this movie looks very good in HD!  ATTACK OF THE CLONES 3.5/5. This has to be my least favorite STAR WARS movie, mostly due to the fact that it heavily relied on CGI most of the time, the story for the most part was good, I think it was critical to show, Anakin's, and Padme's growing relationship, and it was great to see the creation of the clones, and to see young Boba, and his father Jango Fett, Count Dooku is a pretty cool villian. The lightsaber duels fell short on expectations. And this movie looks even better in HD.  REVENGE OF THE SITH 5/5. The reason for my perfect score is simple. It connects the dots for Episode III to Episode IV, and it shows the reason behind, \\"Anakin's Fall\\". And if you read the Expanded Universe, and watch the Clone Wars series, it will show more of Anakin's dark, and rebellious side, the story in this movie is very dark, for STAR WARS standards, and is my second favorite STAR WARS movie, yes there is ton's of CGI in this one, but for good reason, this is the most violent one of them all, and the best looking in HD!  A NEWHOPE 4.5/5. The first STAR WARS movie, and it show's it's age in HD, but that's not really a bad thing, the amazing story is still there, and from what I have seen they have fixed most of the lightsaber coloring in this version, and it appears both, Solo, and Greedo shot at the same time, but that's not a big concern at all, that has nothing to do with the story, I think STAR WARS fans will be pleased with the HD treatment, this one got! Very nice looking in HD!  THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK 5/5. My most favorite STAR WARS movie ever, it's just so flawless, the battle on Hoth is still one of my most favorite parts in STAR WARS history, and Luke's training on Dagobah with Yoda, and realization for Luke, to find the truth of his father, and the astroad battles, this is such an amazing movie, and it looks fantastic in HD, and frankly, the updated special effects just compliment this movie! Very good looking in HD, this one is!  RETURN OF THE JEDI 4/5. The final chapter in the STAR WARS saga, and ends on a high note! This one tells the story Vader's redemption, and of the Rebellion finally defeating the Empire, the only flaw I see in this movie is the Ewok's, seriously?! Ewok's defeating AT Walker's, and Stormtroopers, that's my only problem, and now on to the very controversial \\"NOOOOOO!!\\" scene, yeah it seems strange at first, now I grew up on the \\"Original Version's\\" , but I can see why George wanted to make Vader show emotion, overall great film! And it looks fantasic in HD!  SPECIAL FEATURES 5/5. There a ton of special features, in the Complete Saga box set. You get deleted scene's from Episode 1-VI, they are awesome too, and you get, making of's, easter egg's, etc.  PACKAGING 5/5. As I said, the packaging is awesome, each disc compartment get's it's own art design of a significant event in that film, and the case is basically a hard cover book, just like the AVATAR Extended Edition, if you are a STAR WARS fan, and can look past the minor changes done, it's a must buy,but it would be nice if George added the originals in there, for purest's sake.

B004IQMXD4|5.0|In Your Dreams is Stevie maybe at her best. She has created so much incredible work that it is hard to say what is best. My immediate feeling when I first listened to IYD was this is a major achievement and I see many people feel the same.<br /><br />It's quite different than so much of her work with a blend of the bluesy country ballads and the many other genre Stevie has entertained. What I hear is all of this mixed with a new understanding, it's more mellow and more refined in some ways than past Stevie with a new complexity and with a depth of emotion that goes straight to the soul. Stevie's voice and music usually do go directly to your soul which is what endears her to fans and lovers of high quality music. Her storytelling is at its finest in these dreams which become part of us also.<br /><br />I believe that she may have added some extra chords into her writing for IYD in addition to those in her usual repertoire. I would love to hear the demos for these songs as I often love her demos even more than the studio versions.<br /><br />The songs which stand out for me currently are You May Be the One, For What It's worth, Wide Sargasso Sea, My Heart (an amazing song which is ballad like and Stevie rock like also- this is the Stevie who bewitched us in early days but with something new... it speaks of the past but looks to the future with uplifting chords and a melodic guitar. I just discovered this is a new version of a previous song which I may have missed hearing in the past and it's just perfect here! I'm not sure if it was recorded as more than a demo or not ), Anabelle Lee, Soldier's Angel, Moonlight( A Vampire's Dream) and In Your Dreams.<br /><br />In Your Dreams is top notch work without a doubt and I can hear Stevie's joy in creating this masterpiece. Another reviewer here said this sounds like part one and I certainly hope there will be a part two coming soon. If you're a Stevie fan you're probably going to buy this one anyway and hopefully like it, if not this would be a super intro to her work. Thank you Stevie for all of the beautiful, amazing music you've brought to us over the years. I love your drawings also :)intro to her work.

B002ZG977Y|4.0|It is rare that I like a re-make of a movie but this version I actually prefer over the original. I think that's so because of the more technological advances with special effects. I remember seeing the original and being blown away by the special effects then. Comparing both though you can see how the original now looks like some kind of puppet show.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I literally could not put this book down! From the moment I started the series I was in awe. Being a mother it took me so long to actually read this series because I couldn't imagine finding the fight til your death competition that involved children!!! But Ms Collins did a great job developing her characters and depicting this New World as a successor to the world we know today! I think Katniss really grew up in this book despite previous reviews I read, I think people froget that in this book she was only seventeen and had become the face of a revolution, a mouthpiece for hope, a crutch for the people whi depended on her, a love interest for more than opne person, and a sister and daughter, as well! This is a lot for an ordinary teen to take on let alone thrwoing in all of these additional factors.<br />I love how Collins tears apart the fabricated relationship of Katniss and Peeta and allows Katniss to truly realize her feelings for Peeta and Gale as she starts to realize the woman she has become and the men that each of her love interestes have turned into. The prospect of possibly losing them both allows her to realize that she needs them in completely different ways, therefore she determines who she will spend the rest of her future with! I love how realistic the ending in when it all finally catches up to her and she finally cracks in the end. It is not surprising to see who the only one there for her in the end is.......I loved how Collins developed Peeta in this book, especially when he is stripped of his feelings for Katniss and becomes a more unerving and raw character, and despite all of his torture his true feelings for Katniss overcome it all and they both are able to heal and excel together!!! I also like how Gale becomes the man I always expected him to become from the beginning, always talking of anarchy and fighting for freedom against the Capitol, I think his outcome was the best scenario for him!!<br />Above all else I love how politics and corruption and devotion and true symbolism is captured throughout this book and literally makes you feel emotion for each of these characters. From Haymitch to Finnick, Prim and even some of the other Victors who all have a more in depth story in this one that sheds light on how they became who they are and what they are fighting for!! I loved this book and loved the series even more!! I highly recommend it!nd devotion and true symbolism is captured throughout this book and literally makes you feel emotion for each of these characters.

1597801577|4.0|I don't spend as much time in the science fiction section of the bookstore as I used to, because I've got no patience with all this fantasy glop.  But here's a hard science fiction book on topics that seem pretty up-to-the-moment to me.  It's well written and chock full of interesting ideas.  Brutal in some ways, and I never got really close to any of the characters, but I'll probably read it again.
B001Q9E9F6|3.0|It was interesting to read this, for the first time, nearly 5 years after it was first published. If you are fairly web- and/or business-savvy, then the basic concepts of this book probably are not going to be new to you. However, they are concepts that are often taken for granted.  The value of this book was in highlighting how they are shaping the way we do business.    Unfortunately, this book is rather repetitive and long-winded. It also gets a bit off-track in some places, such as the 8-page love letter to Wikipedia that appears in the middle of Chapter 5 - it could have been cut down to one page or less.  Overall, the book could have been much shorter had it not been so repetitive.    If you want to read through just the meat of it, I would recommend:  Chapters 1-5  Chapter 14 (very short summary chapter)  Optional: Chapter 8    I purchased the older first edition (2006) because I found it in the bargain bin for much cheaper than the \\"Revised and Updated Edition\\" (2008); after skimming through the pages that were tacked-on to the newer edition, I simply didn't feel there was anything of value added.    So, in summary:  - It's been 5 years and the book is starting to lose relevance and show its age.  - The book could have been shorter.  - However, it still has some good content.  - If you can get it cheaply, give the first few chapters a read.
0553386794|5.0|Okay so the book has been out for a *while* and there have been lots of reviews, but wanted to add my thumb's up as well.<br /><br />I've been buying the books since they were released, telling myself that I would read them all once the series was finished since I didn't want to have to reread between books. I finally gave in and read this because of the HBO series, which I am really enjoying. Enjoying so much that I was happily picturing the images from the show as I was reading the book. I didn't want the show to get ahead of me so I finished the book tonight.<br /><br />By now you've heard a lot about the series - and it's true, there are many diverse plots and story lines. Although it's almost 900 pages, there is not a wasted word - the action is steady and the book a page-turner, especially by  midpoint when I could not put it down.<br /><br />I have long been a fan of high fantasy novels, and one of my favorite authors is Guy Gavriel Kay and his fantastic novel [[ASIN:0451457765 Tigana]] One of the things I like about Kay's novels is that the magic is not used as deus ex machina - the characters have to use their wits to get out of trouble. In fact there is not a lot of magic in these books, although there is some with lots of prophesy and foreshadowing.<br /><br />But don't assume that this prophesy and foreshadowing means you will know what will happen -  you won't. There are lots of intriguing and surprising plots twists and turns in this book, and no one is safe.<br /><br />Add to the action and intrigue is lots of humor, brought to you by a dwarf named Tyrian. He may be my favorite character in the book, and that's saying a lot.<br /><br />Highly recommended.  Obviously.<br /><br />*forgot to add that I read some comments that people had problems with the Kindle edition - maybe they've fixed them because I read this on my Kindle and it was just fine.
0670022411|5.0|I loved this book. A little slow in the beginning but than I couldn't put it down! Please tell me there is a sequel!
0446615625|5.0|This book was wonderful, yet at times very busy. Tons going on. Perhaps I should have taken notes during to keep track. But in the end it was tied up very well and I was thoroughly satisfied. Loved some of the characters like Tom Hemingway. That's one bad dude. And of course Stone is pretty tough as well even though he's around 60. I read STONE COLD a few years ago so it was informative to go back and see the beginning of the Camel Club. I am almost going to call Baldacci a genius, but not quite. Close though. He is extremely talented and obviously smart as hell.

B004E2XAFW|4.0|I have been a Within Temptation fan for several years and have yet to hear a bad album. This album is no different and I like how they have coupled it with a comic. I only have one complaint about this product. I purchased the CD/DVD combo because I wanted to see all the extras, which are great. However, I later learned that the Special Edition CD had 3 bonus songs that were not on the CD/DVD combo. It would have been nice to have those bonus songs with the CD/DVD for the extra money I paid to get the combo. I ended up having to buy the bonus songs separately.
B004SEVPWQ|5.0|I've downloaded so many games and this is by FAR the most fun and enticing game for my DX. The only complaint I have is when you get a ball close enough to the hole it can basically hover over the hole but not go in. It needs to be tweaked to where the ball falls in if more than half of it is over the hole.
B000HT3JNY|5.0|This movie is worth its weight in gold. I am totally surprised by the average rating here on Amazon. Reading some of reviews makes me wonder whether the reviewers even understood the theme or whether they were old enough to understand. To me this was clearly never, meant to be a plain old Adam Sandler COMEDY - it is a feel good movie with a wonderful message - that, in the blind and mindless rush to attain professional success - that higher post, that bigger contract, we often tend to take things for granted and neglect the most important things in life - love, togetherness, family and the best moments of happiness with our loved ones. I will not write a spoiler and would urge you to watch the movie yourself. One caveat is that there are certain scenes and dialogues which are not appropriate for young children but they are few and far between. I especially liked the ending because it showed how, the guy realized the true worth of the gifts of family and love - things in life which are more important than people realize and he made it a point to make every moment that much more special from then on - by filling them with love and warmth and appreciation. This movie is worth more than five stars only if you understand it and not expect a shallow slapstick comedy out of it. I did not even find it funny because it was NOT meant to be a FUNNY MOVIE. In fact, with due respect,  comments like '... there were not many funny scenes ...' makes me laugh - at the intelligence of the reviewer. Come on - take off your stereotyping hats and watch this movie with an open mind - ADAM SANDLER IS NOT THE OTHER WORD FOR 'COMEDY' IN THE ENGLISH DICTIONARY. To me, the movie is pure gold. And it will make you smile (NOT laugh) (remembering the good thing that you just saw) for a long time after you have watched it. Its heart warming and one of the best feel good movies with a gem of a message.
B0034G4P80|4.0|What a fanboy dream! Shakespearian Actor/director Kenneth Branagh  directing the epic tale of the God of Thunder.<br /><br />The film tells the story of Thor's exile to Earth or Midguard. To learn how to rule the All Father Odin issues this punishment with the ultimate goal for Thor to lose his hubris and gain so insight before returning to Asgard, but there's more at steak than he or Thor realize. Needless to say the effects, costumes and art direction are all you expect from Marvel.<br /><br />Chris Hensworth...Dug him as brief appearance as kirk's dad, but he was flipping awesome as Thor! The lovable arrogance, Nordic look and the scary body sculpting made him seem born to play the part... Can't wait to see The character return for Avengers (May 4th, 2012)<br /><br />And Sir Tony is all ways great I remember being druggies by one of his break out roles in Magic, he even made Wolfman palatable but he was a natural as Odin in Thor!<br />He deserved to be in the halls of Asgard as do Thor's cohorts.<br /><br />Great as Loki in Thor! Added more that just the slickness you need for The Trickster god, but made him a sympathetic character too. Interesting looking guy...<br /><br />Portman is likable as a mortal scientist ( of course ) who aids and reacts appropriately to the shirtless Thor after hitting him with the car, twice. Kat dennings was fun as Portman's sidekick grad assistant. As is Stellan Skarsgard as Prof Selvig (who we shall see next year in the Avengers too).<br /><br />Watch for comic cameos by Avengers' Hawkeye to Black Panther... And don't forget for you leave early you'll be FURY-ious.<br />Next stop Captain America...

B0041KKYBA|5.0|This not only lays out the details of the most recent financial debacle in ways anyone can understand, it shows how its seeds were sown in the 1980s and how we are still poised for yet a worse cataclysm in the (near) future.  Everyone should see this, and everyone should be equally scared and enraged as a result.
B0028MBKVG|2.0|This book is a great read, and is very inspiring.  However, if you have feet with high arches (pes cavus) then rethink this whole \\"you were built to run\\" thing.  If you have high arches, you likely are a \\"supinator\\" meaning your feet underpronate (they lean to the outside).  You can tell because your shoes will typically wear out on the outsides (laterally), meaning if you place an old pair together they will lean away from each other.  You will tend to have strong, well-developed calves and get bad calluses on your feet, especially the outer front pads (right behind your little toes).  Podiatrists tend to be pretty useless for the most part and will tell you all sorts of things (like you should not run), and try to sell you on all kinds of misguided treatments or therapies.      Your best results will come from the following:  1.  Stay away from this \\"minimallist\\" shoe trend.  You need \\"neutral plus\\" running shoes.  Look 'em up on any running shoe website (roadrunnersports is a good site).    2.  Use semi-rigid high arch support orthotics.    3.  You should put something soft and cushy over these orthotics.  I recommend the \\"neutral plus\\" inserts from roadrunnersports.  4.  Stretch your calves and do exercises for your instep.    5.  Regularly shave your calluses to keep the excessive hard dead tissue from damaging your feet.
B004MNVKVO|5.0|I think most people who buy this deluxe edition are already in possession of a previous edition, so I think it doesn't   need introduction, \\"moving pictures\\" is the masterpiece of rush, that contains at least 4 songs that had been continuously in the tracklist of every rush concert in the last 30 years (Tom Sawyer, Red Barchetta, YYZ and Limelight)     the most attractive part of this deluxe edition is therefore the blueray that contains the remixed album in 5.1, I have heard it a dozen times, and I must say that it is absolutely fantastic, awesome, the sound is perfect, very well balanced , and you can hear a lot of details that on CD was not possible to hear (especially the guitar of alex), the 5.1 remix is done intelligently, with most of the music focused on the front speakers,and the effects maintained on the rear, contributing to a good surround     higly recommended
B0034G4P8A|5.0|I agree with all the praise everyone has already heaped on this movie. it is the best.  I'm an old fanboy and I couldn't wipe the silly grin off my face for the whole movie.  All I'll add is if you have the chance to see this in 3D at an IMAX, it's worth every penny.
B0034G4OXQ|4.0|I just viewed this movie and thought it was very nicely done. I was really surprised (pleasantly) that Clint Eastwood was the force behind the film. As an author/journalist who is married to an intuitive (who recently stopped giving personal readings after two decades) the material was familiar and comfortable, and offered understanding and insight into what those who are in touch with the other side (as well as those who want to be) experience.     I felt the film portrayed many of the emotions and traits of the \\"psychic,\\" the people in the business of representing the \\"other side,\\" and the clients quite accurately. Many of the reasons Matt Damon's character gave for stepping away from the needs, dependencies, and emotional demands of people burdened with loss were valid and understandable. While people certainly need help in reaching those who have passed, for an intuitive to deal with grieving, desperate folks every day, knowing that giving them what they may need to hear (from those who have passed) may not necessarily be what they want to hear, this takes a great toll on those who authentically provide this service. The complexities of this situation were well portrayed in the film.    What I especially enjoyed about this film was the way it was set up to offer an example of synchronicity in life, with three disconnected lives that all had wounds from personal tragedies, three seemingly unrelated stories, that, in the end, came together (as they were meant to) to complete pieces of each life's destiny. While one reviewer saw the end as a typical Hollywood ending, I felt it perfectly illustrated how so many events and seemingly chance meetings provide opportunities and perhaps pre-destined openings for us to find our true paths. I felt the two adult main characters would go on to write a better book (as well as a better story for their lives) and this book could not be written without the seemingly chance intersection of all three lives. The boy asked the question, the psychic didn't truly know the answer, the woman had been there, but she needed help to fully round out the experience. All three were important and necessary for the end result to occur.    Just as portrayed in the movie, these events happen every day--every single day--if we are open to recognizing them. I was happy to see that the creators of this film recognize that and found a way to offer that vision to the world, for those ready to embrace it. While many who were looking for action and adventure and typical Hollywood fare seem to feel cheated (evidenced by several reviews on this site), perhaps a second viewing, seeing the film's potential as a story about what is happening beyond the surface of our world (and our lives) would offer a deeper understanding of how naturally synchronicity works, when we are open to it.    Good job to the folks who created and offered this film to the world at a time when it helps us to make sense of tragedy and provides a journey into what is possible if we reach out to each other. For those looking to view an example of the journeys that many are taking at this time (either knowingly or not), this is a nice movie to help with understanding the potential and possibilities for growth.     Those who still need some questions answered, ones that weren't as easily recognized by all viewers in the film, are welcome to discover them at the Answers From Above site (our communicated messages for the world), a free source of hundreds of actual messages from the \\"other side,\\" many that answer questions like those posed in this movie. I only mention this because the film demonstrates how so many people are searching and are unable to find authenticity in information while on their quest. Answers are out there and few should have to weed through the inauthentic when they need help and solace, especially when people are lost in their grief, just as the young boy in the movie was, as well as the clients chasing after George.    Again,good job Mr. Eastwood and crew. I hope we will see more movies of substance like this in the near future.
B002RHL8DC|5.0|As a fan of the other two Stargate series, I have found SGU, both season 1 and 2, to be an excellent addition. It is a bit darker and more emotionally complex than the other series. I found this to be a plus because it differentiates it from the other two. It has a new perspective, setting, and characters, but still references and has appearances of the other Stargate series to tie it in. If you are a Stargate fan, or a fan of sci-fi, space shows, drama, or just want to check out something new, I highly recommend watching the SGU series.

0670022411|5.0|I thought this book was great.  Unlike many teen paranormal novels, the story had depth.  Unlike many other adult paranormal novels, it didn't bore with endless details.  It was just perfect.  The romance was seductive, the conflict was interesting, I cared about the characters, and it was funny.  I love books where the characters are witty. Cannot wait to read the next one.

B0046MOVD0|4.0|I loved the movie! I've been following the Resident Evil movies since the first one came out. I've loved them all, and this one is no exception. The plot was good, the effects were stellar, as always, and the acting was superb. My only complaint about the movie was that because it was shot for 3D, the action sequences rely heavily on the 3D aspect of the film, and without the 3D, the action sequences are detracted from by it. I don't like 3D; that's just my personal opinion, and I think that the action sequences in this movie suffer because there are parts of them that are obviously made for 3D, and without the 3D aspect, they seem to lack somewhat in punch compared to the others.
0375704027|5.0|Murakami is someone I've never fully embraced, yet keep coming back to.   I don't like some of the fantastic and surreal elements of his writing, but I'm also drawn by the energy, intelligence, and inventiveness of it.  And I also love how he infuses his work with elements of Western culture, especially music.    Norwegian Wood is a straight-on story about love and loss, and coming of age.  It's not cluttered by any surrealism or fantasy.  And it's loaded with musical references to classical and jazz, as well as the Western rock music of the late sixties.  (As the title would suggest.)  Thus, Norwegian Wood was exactly the right Murakami book to pick up next, the one book to push me further into his work.    It tells the story of Toru Watanabe, a college freshman living in Tokyo.  Like many young men his age, he doesn't know what he wants to do with his life, and majors in drama for no real reason.  And like many men his age, women both complicate and clarify things.      He has relationships with two completely different women: the troubled and introspective Naoko and the outgoing and spunky Midori.  Naoko poses the most trouble for Toru for many reasons.  First, she's the ex-girlfriend of Toru's best friend in high school, Kizuki, who committed suicide at 17.  Kizuki's death had a major impact on both friends.  For Naoko, she lost not just a boyfriend, but someone she had known since childhood, someone who had become almost a part of herself.  For Toru, his friend's suicide changed his perspective on life, filling everything with the taste of death.  `Death is not the opposite of life, but a part of it', becomes his new motto.      So when Toru and Naoko meet again, accidentally, on the subway, there's a connection, but a troubled one.  The ghost of Kizuki hangs over them.  They begin with odd walks through the city, Toru trailing Naoko like a puppy.  But eventually a form of love develops.  Once things eventually come to a head on her 20th birthday, their relationship becomes further complicated as Naoko runs away to a kind of sanatorium in the mountains over Kyoto.  Months pass before Toru even knows where she's gone, and he lives in a sort of limbo, going to school, working at a record store.  Waiting.        Meanwhile, he meets Midori, a fellow drama student.  They form an immediate bond, though she has a boyfriend and has her own problems with her troubled family life, including a father dying of brain cancer.  They become fast friends, and Toru finds himself attracted to her despite the pain he still feels at the loss of Naoko.         Of course, Naoko muddies the waters again by writing him to tell him where she is and inviting him to visit.  There he meets Naoko's roommate, Reiko, an older woman with a talent for music.  The three spend much time sitting around while Reiko plays guitar for them, including Naoko's favorite song, Norwegian Wood.  In a sense, Reiko becomes the third woman in Toru's life, because she is open, and they develop a friendship in his short time there.  With Naoko, he learns some more about her issues, but just enough happens to keep him connected to her, not enough to resolve their love.  He is still in a limbo.      Murakami teases the frustrations of this state out of Toru.  Toru agonizes over his dilemma, stuck between a woman he loves but can't have and a great woman he can have.  Midori begins to fall for him and pressures him.  But he's waiting for something to happen.  Of course, something does.  But then what?  Has he waited too long?    This is a great story, but it is further strengthened by great characters.  Besides Toru and Midori, whose honest, straight-forward manners combine with deep vulnerabilities to make them both irresistible, Murakami fills the landscape with great supporting actors as well.  Reiko steals each scene she walks into.  Toru's anal roommate \\"Storm Trooper\\" makes for some good laughs, and is a great source of conversation for Toru.  Nagasawa is a privileged student of an elite university who is drawn to Toru through a shared love of Western literature and uses his influence to help Toru out of a few jams.  Yet his arrogance and womanizing also adds a layer of complexity to the friendship, as these traits both compel and repulse Toru.  The characters really make this book hard to put down.      Norwegian Wood is a great read and will definitely keep me on the path to reading more Murakami.
0425188809|5.0|This is the first Koontz book I have ever read and he has me hooked now.   Amazing book and at this time the best book I have ever read, bar none!!!  I am a bit worried that no other Koontz book will live up to the this one - characters all had their own unique personalities and you care about each one - both the good and evil.  A must read for any dog lover.
B00003CXBK|5.0|My son wanted me to get this movie for him because he said it was the best work by Hayao Miyazaki.  The English version has some very big names in it, like Minnie Driver, Billy Crudup, Claire Danes, Gillian Anderson, Jada Pinkett Smith and Billy Bob Thornton.  Even as an adult, I found myself drawn to it, very epic and a good combination of action and fantasy.  A good purchase.

B0034G4P80|4.0|Thor is Marvel's best superhero movie yet.  It is even better than the first Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk films.  It is also the most visually stunning of any Marvel film, with gorgeous fantasy settings, great costumes, and spectacular special effects.<br /><br />In the same way as Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight worked just as well as a crime drama as a superhero movie, Thor works just as well as a standalone fantasy film.  Even if I had not known that I was watching a comic book movie, I would have been just as happy with the story.  In fact, I would say that you don't actually need to be familiar with the characters or the comic mythology to enjoy the film.<br /><br />The story is set half in Asgard, the realm of the gods, and half in our world, Earth.  Thor, the son of the king of Asgard, the wise Odin, is a proud and arrogant king-in-waiting.  He makes a foolish mistake that brings his world to the brink of war and his father exiles him to our world as punishment, and maybe to teach him how to be a better man.  On Earth, Thor makes some new friends and even begins to fall in love with a pretty scientist.  Meanwhile, in Asgard, his brother Loki begins to put into motion a plot that may threaten Thor's home.<br /><br />Two things about the film really stood out to me.  The first is the absolutely beautiful settings and solid world-building in the movie.  Asgard looks amazing, with settings such as the Rainbow Bridge, a crystal structure with colored lights running through it, spanning a sea that flows into a massive waterfall, cascading down into the open cosmos.  Also, great costuming really makes the gods stand out, and adds to the film's epic feel.  The second thing was the character of Loki, the film's antagonist.  Watching the trailers, I expected a greasy, honorless villain (someone like Wormtongue from the Lord of the Rings).  Instead I got the story of a hero, told in reverse.  Loki's story mirrors his brother Thor's, but where Thor starts out as an arrogant royal brat and through his time on Earth comes to realize what it means to be a hero, Loki begins the story as a mischievous but honorable man, and over the course of the film turns into a really bad guy.  As Thor rises, he falls.  And when his final plan is revealed at the end of the film, it totally fits his personality and everything you know about him.  In other superhero films, we're used to seeing the bad guy go on some kind of mindless rampage at the end of the film.  We saw it in The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man, the Spider Man movies, the Fantastic Four...but not here.  Loki acts like a man with a purpose.  Actually he has two purposes, both very personal to him.  One is to do commit a terrible act of destruction, partly out of self-loathing and partly out of a twisted sense of honor toward his father.  And the other is simply to beat his brother, proving himself Thor's equal.  He is easily the deepest villain of any of the Marvel films so far.<br /><br />The film is directed by Shakespearean actor Kenneth Branagh (Gilderoy Lockhart!), who handles the epic material perfectly.  More than any Marvel film so far, this one focuses on the hero's journey.  Even more than a comic book movie, this is a fantasy film about a hero.  Expect father-son drama, palace intrigue in the realm of the gods, and an epic confrontation between two brothers who have been become very different people over the course of the story.  There is also plenty of humor, with a few real laugh-out-loud moments.  And there is a very sweet, almost cute romance woven into the story.  It carries an innocent, young-love kind of feeling.  It also takes the two characters, one a god more concerned with war and glory, the other a scientist more concerned with solving the mysteries of the universe, and brings them down to earth in their budding love for one another.<br /><br />I would recommend Thor to any lover of fantasy films, as well as any fans of comic book movies such as Marvel's Avengers lineup.  It is solid fantasy fun with a strong sense of the epic and the heroic.  And when you see Thor finally wield his hammer and summon the lightning, you'll want to stand up and cheer.h a strong sense of the epic and the heroic.  And when you see Thor finally wield his hammer and summon the lightning, you'll want to stand up and cheer.
B000O77RLE|5.0|Letters From Iwo Jima is simply spectacular.  Better by far than Flags of Our Fathers,  Letters gives us a vivid look into the hopeless zealous of the Japanese military as they are lose the island of Iwo Jima, and the futility of their fight.  Their are two people the movie focuses on: Gen. Tadamichi Kuribayashi and his command of Jap forces on the island, and a young PVC named Saigo.  A soldier who wishes nothing more than to be home with his pregnant wife.    Many have called this an anti-war film due to the sympathy it gives to some of the Japanese soldiers, however it seemed to me that it showed two different types of people in any bad-guy military: the soldier who knows that he is fighting for the wrong side but does it anyway (Gen. Kuribayashi), and the other (Saigo  who decides to hell with this, and looks to be captured so that at least he has some chance of getting home.  This movie goes out to the few Japanese men who surrendered to the Allies, and to those who knew better.    This is now one of my favorite war dramas, and for those reluctant to see it due to all the press that it was an anti-war, anti-American movies, please give it a chance.  I did and I realized how wrong I was.      5 out of 5!
B001AQT11M|5.0|Anything Disney/Pixar makes is a wonderful, enjoyable movie for the whole  family to watch together or just alone.  Quality material, great stories chosen    from our childhood and exciting to watch again as adults.  Out takes are hilarious.
1595141715|1.0|This book may do more harm than good. As a book about suicide nowhere does it say that suicide is not common, suicide is not normal and that suicide is not an OK way to deal with problems. Is it OK for someone to take their own life because of issues with peers? I don't think so. Bullying does not cause suicide, no one thing causes suicide. By simplifying a problem that is one of the most complex public health challenges we face today you missed the mark.

The story had promise for sure but it's delivered like a Saturday morning, 'made for TV' drama - aimed at 10 year olds. Even the first five minutes of 'set up' by the narrator are painful to listen to and you get this 'oh no' feeling like someone has made some very bad choices in making this film.

Love the addition of Minnie who apparently has some of her mother's traits. Rebecca still has the crazy personality that you love and end up cheering for!   The only authors that I enjoy reading as much as Sophie Kinsella are Mary Kay Andrew and Meg Cabot. Thanks for the heroic funny women characters!
B0037LXTUW|3.0|I can see the potential for fun, but Dixit did not bind well with the different groups of gamers I play with. It's definitely more of a party game, light hearted and useful for building relations and getting to know people. As my fellow gamers are familiar with each other and prefer games of strategy, economics and warfare it didn't really appeal to them. I would say that Dixit is a better version of Apples to Apples, as the scoring is better and some of the pictures are... cool/wild/weird/a trip/funny/unique. This game seems like it would be incredibly fun to play while intoxicated or high.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I bought this unit so I could do videogame commentary for my walkthroughs that I do on YouTube and I've noticed that when I first bought this unit I was actually having problems as I have seen from others of keeping the headset from staying on the entire time and not having it shut off during commentary.<br /><br />I did go on the Logitech website and it looks like their forums are a lot more of users trying to help each other out with third party plugin and scripts than actual help from Logitech which is a bit disconcerting... other than that I quickly found out that the reason for the auto-shutoff is if the headset detects noise or feedback from the computer.  That being said, I found a quick workaround for it by just switching over the audio and microphone settings to the headset when doing my commentary and since then I have yet to encounter the auto-shutoff coming on.<br /><br />I sit roughly 15-20 feet away from the receiver which I have pointed at my couch and I have a lot of tech sitting on my desk so I guess you could say there would be a bit of radio interference and this unit has worked flawlessly ever since.  I haven't really had any use for the voice morphing software since I'm basically just recording live commentary to be edited into the gameplay, so I can't really comment on that-- if you're not concerned about price and you're looking for a quality headset, this would definitely be for you.

0307272702|5.0|The message in Gary Taubes' previous book, \\"Good Calories, Bad Calories\\", is that carbohydrates are unhealthy. \\"Why We Get Fat\\" expands on this theory in a less technical and much easier to read format. His convincing conclusion is that \\"The fewer carbohydrates we consume, the leaner we will be.\\" Therefore, by limiting our intake of carbs, we can eat as much protein and fat as we want and still lose weight.    Taubes presents a strong argument with convincing evidence, that debunks the \\"calories in / calories out\\" theory: we gain weight because we consume more calories than we expend. He explains that the mechanisms of the body are not so simple. If we take in fewer calories, the body adjusts, burning fewer calories and causing us to feel tired and lethargic as a result. Taubes also makes a case that you can't lose weight by exercising, since by burning more calories you'll just end up eating more.    There is an excellent explanation of how insulin converts the carbohydrates that enter the bloodstream as glucose into fat which is stored in our fat tissues. Therefore, \\"you don't lose fat because you cut calories; you lose fat because you cut out the foods that make you fat - the carbohydrates.\\"    The book contains a list of recommended foods (including meat, poultry, fish, eggs, cheese, fats, oils, salad greens and fiber-rich vegetables) along with a list of restricted foods (including sugar, corn syrup, beer, milk, fruit, grains, rice, cereals, flour, bread, pasta and potatoes). The overall message is a dieter's dream - if you avoid the restricted foods, you can eat as much of the recommended foods as you want and you'll lose weight without ever being hungry. However, since this is not a diet book, there are no recipes, but there are many low/no carbohydrate diet books available, such as Atkins, that follow Taubes' guidelines.    I think that the overall message of the book is sound, but the recommendations may be somewhat extreme. Because this diet can have harmful effects on some people, it should be done under a doctor's supervision, which could be a problem because \\"Doctors who understand why we get fat and what to do about it are obviously hard to find; otherwise this book wouldn't be necessary.\\"     There are a few questions that Taubes fails to answer. What foods would fill all the aisles in our supermarkets if people stopped buying bread, pasta, potatoes, cookies, snacks, soda, beer, ice cream, cakes, fruits and grains? How can poor people, who are much more likely to be obese because they tend to buy cheaper, high carbohydrate foods, afford this diet? Why, if carbohydrates are so bad for us, are they at the base of the FDA's food pyramid? And why, if the healthcare costs from people being overweight are so high, are there no large scale studies that can answer the question of what is the best diet to keep us healthy, trim and satisfied? See the title of my review for a possible answer.
B004MNVKVO|5.0|I am simply goig to comment on the BluRay DTS HD 5.1 surround mix of Moving Pictures.  This is a fantastic mix of the classic Rush album which puts the listener in the center of an onslaught of delectable sound.  The drum kit literally surrounds you as the various tom toms are hit.  The various overdubs evenly fill the space without gaps, providing an encompassing feeling I rarely have heard on other surround sound mixes.  For the hi-fi enthusiasts, the BluRay HD's sound quality is purely smooth without any edginess, you will not feel any ear fatigue after listening to this mix at a loud volume.  Enjoy!

B000O178BY|5.0|After getting back to business with 2005 music friendly 'With Teeth', Trent Reznor unleashes 'Year Zero', a concept album full of heavy beats and shreding guitars. Set in the future and yes its a bleak place with no hope for mankind.     From the moment you hear Josh Freese's drums on 'Hyperpower' you should realise that this is going to be a loud ride. There is nothing in here for present day fans of fall out boy, my chemical romance etc. But what you do get is an album full of some of Trent Reznors best work, 'Survivalism' is a loud assault of guitars and includes one of Trent's best ever choruses, 'Capital G' gets to the point of the matter and it shouldn't be to hard to guess who hes talking about. 'Vessel' is full of suggestive lyrics, 'Me, I'm not' has buddy Saul Williams tucked in the background. 'God Given' and 'Meet your master' are two heavy hitters and are definitely made for playing live. Year Zero's last two songs are works of art, 'In This Twilight' is brilliant and features a great Reznor hook for the chorus. 'Zero sum' finishes the album perfectly on a lighter note.     Reznor wrote most of the album while on the 'With Teeth' world tour and said he was listening to a lot of Public Enemy and that they had a big influence on Year Zero's sound.     If this is what music will sound like in the future them maybe there's hope left for the music world yet.
B004K4IZ54|2.0|Not alot of really good 3D technology associated with this release. Shouldn't have been sold as such with the poor quality and very few scenes that had any 3D in them
B001B71NOI|4.0|For a person who only released three full length albums from 1989 to 2005, Trent Reznor must be making up for lost time as The Slip is album number four since 2005s With Teeth and second in the space of a couple of months following March's 2008 release of instrumental classic Ghosts i-iv. That's not including a remix album and a live dvd/blu ray.     This album got its physical release in July 2008 after its free download release in may 2008, and its classic nin, where as ghosts was all instrumental The Slip has complete vocal tracks and they are brilliant. 1,000,000 and Letting You are two of the best songs to start any nin album. They hit you like a freight train and would become a staple of that summers brilliant Lights in the Sky tour, starting the show every night. Your then hit by Discipline which has a real disco dance feel to it, Echoplex and Head Down are real growers that will have you coming back for repeated listens. They are followed by the instrumental part of the album, Lights in the Sky which has a very quietly sung lyrics, Corona Radiata continues the Ghosts theme. The Four of us are Dying wouldn't have been out of place on 1999s album The Fragile. The album finishes with the brilliant Demon Seed which started life as Ghost 38 on the deluxe edition of Ghosts i-1v.     The cd also comes with a bonus dvd that has the band playing five songs (1,000,000, letting you, discipline, echoplex and head down) from rehearsals and is a nice bonus. all the cds are numbered from 1 to 250,000 and is a limited release, so get your copy before it gets rare and expensive.
0312944926|1.0|After being completely underwhelmed by The Da Vinci Code I tried this one by Dan Brown.  I'm sorry, but Digital Fortress is just painfully bad.  The writing is extremely amateurish at times resembling something a 13 year old boy might produce.  The dialog is very unrealistic.  The characters, all presumably the best and brightest, are unbelievably dense.  The prose is inundated with absurd simile.  All the foreign dialog is written and then immediately translated which I found very distracting and unnecessary.  The technical research appears to be based on an extensive list of buzz words each strategically placed to sound legitimate; but this strategy fails miserably.  Additionally, the author must hold some kind of grudge against the country of Spain for some reason.  There are many backhanded as well as fore-handed insults to the country and culture.  In summary, this is a poorly written and utterly preposterous story.  On the plus side, anyone who has dreamed of becoming a published author should hold out hope.  If this thing can be published, anything can.

B002LFPAUC|5.0|Epic show, the \\"remastered\\" edition doesn't seem too different to the origional DVD set i got around 5+ years ago...I took a side by side Screen shot, and it appears the main difference is a slight color correction (which on the opening scene looks like it was too yellow on the origional DVD's), and there appears to be some detail added back, as it appears slightly more grainy in the new one. Unlikely you would notice the difference unless careful side by side analysis.    That said, buy it for the interviews and commentary!

0307588343|5.0|This is a fresh, entertaining and insightful perspective, shared with wit, humor and emotion, by an insider who was in a position to see and participate in what turns out to be a historic series of events.     In reading this book it is evident that McDonald had great affection for Lehman, and it adds to the book's credibility that it so pains him to chronicle the \\"red flags\\" that eventually culminate in Lehman's demise.     Though he often is referring to just-emerging, complex, sophisticated financial products and concepts - that are the bread and butter of the investment banking world - McDonald explains them in very `accessible' ways that even those not familiar with them can grasp the essentials and appreciate not just what they are, but what they represent, and the massive potential (for risk, reward, etc.) they hold. It also elucidates various \\"lessons learned\\" that likely many in diverse management and professional roles (not just in finance) will identify and perhaps \\"note\\".    In using Lehman as the primary reference point - citing numerous impressive and interesting personalities along the way - McDonald's book is also good for some who may wish to get a glimpse into some of the `macro' issues that lead up to not just Lehman's downfall, but to what became an inter-related series of reverberations that affected thousands of people (regular homeowners and people with all kinds of livelihoods - as well as those in `fancy finance jobs')-  in so many companies - and in so many countries.

1594744769|3.0|\\"Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children\\" follows the story of 16-year-old Jacob. Jacob is very close with his grandfather, who has, from Jacob's earliest memories, told wild stories of his childhood. He even has the pictures to prove it. Granted, the photos look cheap and doctored to Jacob's 21st-century eyes, but that doesn't change the fact that the stories are fantastic. It stops being fantastic as Jacob nears adulthood, however; his grandfather claims that monsters are following him everywhere he goes, that they're going to kill him.  Jacob dismisses it sadly, believing his grandfather is slowly losing his mind. His belief is shaken when his grandpa is mysteriously murdered, torn apart in the woods behind his home. Jacob is the one who finds his grandfather. Just as the paramedics rush in, Jacob spots a horrific monster prowling the scene.<br /><br />Of course, it disappears.<br /><br />Jacob is thrust into therapy by anxious parents. The trauma is slowly driving him mad. At the suggestion of his psychiatrist, Jacob decides to spend a summer at his grandfather's childhood home, a small island off the coast of Wales. It is there he discovers that all his grandfather's delightfully insane stories are true. What's more, the very same children in the photographs are alive and well, hidden because they are just as threatened as they are dangerous. They're threatened by mysterious, awful creatures called hollowgasts. The problem is, these childen can't see them. In fact, only Jacob's grandfather could. As it happens, so can Jacob.<br /><br />I liked the story, but I didn't particularly like the book. It wasn't exactly bad. The ideas regarding time travel were interesting, and the hollowgasts and wights were pretty awesome. But \\"Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children\\" felt undeveloped. It starts off well, with Jacob's childhood recollections, and stays quite decent up til his first night at the \\"Home.\\" It sort of unravels there, feeling rushed. There is nextto no character development, with the exceptions of Jacob and his grandfather. Emma's character started off promising, until she forgot Jacob's grandfather, a supposedly decades-old love, in a proverbial heartbeat. While the book is well-imagined, it isn't fleshed out very well. The explanations offered are shallow, simplistic, and almost happy-go-lucky in a way.<br /><br />It was a pretty fun story, but it had no depth. I found it very boring in some places. It looks to be the first in a series, and while it's a very narrow margin, I'll probably pick up the second one. It shows just enough promise. Thus, by the narrowest of margins, I'd recommend you pick it up. It's a fair rainy-day read, though not much more.

B0000027F8|4.0|George Michael has become better known for his sexual orientation issues and for being arrested in a public bathroom in L.A. than for his musical legacy. But in the late 80's he was musically a big deal with the success of the monster album \\"Faith\\" which came on the heels of his radio hit friendly duo Wham. He was clearly trying to establish himself as a more serious musical artist at each step along the way and with \\"Listen Without Prejudice\\" he largely succeeded to accomplish this feat. Not much on this record sounds like the pop music that made \\"Faith\\" as successful as it was with the possible exception of \\"Freedom\\" which would have easily fit into that record. Most of the songs are ballads and there was less emphasis on the hit song, MTV friendly numbers than trying to write emotive songs that resonated with the listener. The album is largely acoustic and Michael's voice has a tonal quality that reminds me of Gino Vanelli (Cowboys and Angels) on occasion. Perhaps the best song is \\"Waiting for That Day\\" which again is mostly acoustic with an interesting addition of  the Rolling Stones \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\" at the end which includes an actual royalty acknowledgement on the liner notes. The song \\"Soul Free\\" is more upbeat and is served up as a counter to the largely introspective song writing that dominates the record. Overall, this record is a stripped down view into the soul of a guy who was struggling with enormous fame and personal issues that would continue to haunt him years later. But, as far as music in 1990 is concerned I put this record right up there and give Michael full points on this excellent effort.<br />I was curious about the cover photo which I assumed was a concert scene. But when I noticed the bathing suits were very dated looking I saw that it's actually a cropped version of a photograph of Coney Island beach in 1940 by a photog named WeeGee.

0061726826|5.0|Lauren Oliver is a great writer. The storyline was very interesting and I was absorbed within the first few pages.<br /><br />This story is set in a society that does not believe in love. You are not able to choose who to marry or even what to study in college. Upon your 18th birthday, you are given an evaluation and then a score. The evaluation process is judged on personality, looks and grades. You are then \\"matched\\" up with 4 different mates. You pick in order from 1-4 which you would like to be paired with and the government decides. When you turn 18, you will then have a procedure on your brain to remove love and pain and you will never be able to feel again.<br /><br />The book is looking through 17 year old Lena's eyes. She cannot wait for the procedure. She would like to just get it over with and be happy and normal. That is...until she meets Alex. Alex is an invalid and lives in the \\"wild\\". There are some people that cannot even think of having the procedure and they escape and live in the wilderness close by. It takes you on a crazy emotional roller coaster as Lena has to decide whether she is doing right by getting the procedure or if she should refuse and follow Alex?<br /><br />Throughout the book, it makes you think of what life would be like not loving or feeling. I, personally, would have to live in the wild. I would not imagine not being able to love again. Life would be so empty and meaningless.

1423113381|5.0|*This isn't really a full review--just some gushings of mine over the book. I wanted to do an Amazon review of it only because I loved it so much.*<br /><br />Since I'd never really known much about Egyptian mythology, I had no idea what to expect from this book, except from a lot of stuff about pharaohs, maybe. Turns out I needn't have worried, because this book kicked some serious butt! It's an action-packed ride of awesomesauce with endearing characters--Sadie, the ever-witty Brit was probably my favorite--and solid mythology.<br /><br />In a way this book is a lot like Rick Riordan's Greek Mythology books, with similar themes--like Gods must work with humans to maintain order--but I suppose that can't be helped.<br /><br />Anxiously waiting for Book 2!
B000FZETKC|5.0|Out of all the John Hughes pictures I've seen, SOME KIND OF WONDERFUL ranks first in my heart, with FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF and THE BREAKFAST CLUB slugging it out for a second place finish. And, yeah, it wasn't John Hughes who directed this one (but rather Howard Deutch), but SOME KIND OF WONDERFUL is full of those quintessential John Hughes touches. And, besides, Hughes wrote the thing. This movie is when I fell in love with Mary Stuart Masterson, and, to me, clearly, her character Watts, sardonic and disaffected and yet secretly in love, is the most vital role in the film.<br /><br />John Hughes knows how painful high school can be, knows how big a deal it is for teens. He has this knack for tapping into the heart of the teenaged struggle. When we were kids, our world revolved around this quest for self-identity and a place in the pecking order and there was always, always this pressure to fit in. There's a reason Hughes' films in the '80s have stood the test of time. He makes it so personal and approaches it with great sensitivity and wit and real emotion. He makes you invest.<br /><br />Back in high school, you and I, we can relate to what Keith Nelson is going thru. Shy and closed-in and a bit of an outcast, Keith (Eric Stoltz) has fallen hopelessly for the most popular girl in school, Amanda Brown (Lea Thompson). Amanda lives in the same blue collar neighborhood as Keith and his best friend Watts. Except that Amanda happens to date the rich big man on campus and hangs with the posh, trendy crowd. Or as Watts, a devastatingly cute tomboy, remarks: \\"Guilt by association.\\" Amanda is clearly out of Keith's league. But Keith is one of those brave souls who opts to lay his heart on the line. Did I say brave? Maybe I meant stupid. Even Watts is trying to drive sense into Keith. Of course, she's got ulterior motives.<br /><br />Keith girds his loins or screws his courage to the sticking place or whatever, and he puts himself out there. Surprisingly, his overtures toward Amanda are met with success and she agrees to a date. Mostly because Amanda's boyfriend has been acting like a champion tool (and Craig Sheffer is so good as the bad guy here). The film messes with the viewer. It initially establishes Watts as the rooting interest. She's the one pining for her best friend. But then the film turns around and makes Amanda Brown a sympathetic character also worth rooting for. I think that this is one of Lea Thompson's best roles. She makes Amanda Brown a three-dimensional person who gets hurt the same as anyone, and not 'til the very end do you really know with whom Keith will end up.<br /><br />It's one of those perfect casts, really. I think everyone is strong in their parts, from John Aston's demanding working class father who doesn't quite get his introspective son to Elias Koteas' howlingly funny rebel punk who befriends Keith and, in an odd way, plays a sort of fairy godmother role. But, really, SOME KIND OF WONDERFUL belongs to Mary Stuart Masterson. She's the heart of it all. Equal parts defiant and vulnerable, she breaks your heart many times in this film. And how can you not fall for Watts, a wounded girl who not only is a bit of an iconoclast but who also plays the drums? How can you not pull for her? And yet, on the other hand, there stands Amanda Brown, equally wounded and who stands up for herself and is equally deserving of that good ending. SOME KIND OF WONDERFUL is a legitimate romantic triangle and one of the best teen movies I've ever seen. Teen angst and social conflict and another superb 1980s soundtrack. Characters that feel real and emotional arcs that draw you in. This was when John Hughes still had that magic touch.<br /><br />The DVD's extras: Audio Commentary by Lea Thompson and director Howard Deutch (Thompson and Deutsch are married in real life); the \\"Making Of\\" the film featurette (00:07:45 minutes long); \\"Meet the Cast\\" (00:13:26); the Music; a Photo Gallery; and the \\"John Hughes Time Capsule,\\" whichis a Kevin Bacon interview of John Hughes in 1986, huge chunks of which concern SOME KIND OF WONDERFUL (00:10:49).is a Kevin Bacon interview of John Hughes in 1986, huge chunks of which concern SOME KIND OF WONDERFUL (00:10:49).
0385523394|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. The author holds nothing back as she describes her life- it's a refreshing account of someone who I found I could relate to very much. Her way of organizing the story keeps it from ever getting slow- rather than describing her day-to-day experience purely chronologically, she cuts between topics and people that she forms connections with during her time in prison, which keeps things lively.<br />Piper's story is fascinating, because she was a fairly typical person living a fairly typical life, whose dalliances as a recent college graduate caught up with her nearly ten years later. However, she never seemed to adopt a woe-is-me attitude about her forced term in prison, which is certainly what allowed her to survive the experience with her integrity and sense of humor intact.<br />I can't imagine someone not finding this book fascinating for one reason or another. On one hand, it discusses the ins and outs of the world inside the prison system; and as a student of psychology, sociology, and criminal justice, I find that my interest in this world was strengthened because of this book. However, I also related to Piper Kerman as a person- her life was tremendously ordinary, and she just happened to get caught in her past in a way that most people don't. This was the most riveting part of this story- that it could happen to any of us.
0470932139|5.0|The technical aspects of photography can sometimes overwhelm me, but this book delivered many \\"light bulb moments\\".  I would recommend it for both beginning and seasoned food photographers and stylists.  The book is packed with detailed tips and tricks that are easy to understand and are well demonstrated.  I would say that even photographers of subjects other than food would find this book a source of valuable aesthetic principles and techniques.    The photography section alone made this book worthwhile for me, but the styling sections made it unlike any other food photography book that I've seen.  This will be one reference book I will use a lot.
006112429X|2.0|I loved Shriver's  \\"The Post Birthday World\\", and can't deny she's a terrific writer,but as I plodded towards the end of this book with amounting sense of dread, I started to feel like I didn't want to finish it because the final act reveal was already too clear in my head, and I just didn't want to go there. Well, I did,and frankly I wish I hadn't. For me what started off as a woman's exploration of her growing concern that something wasn't right with her child, moved into the kind of unmitigated horror show that Stephen King is a master at crafting. I found myself getting so frustrated at this woman's husband, whose blind devotion to a prepubescent  sociopath would cause this rift in their marriage, as well as endanger the life of their younger daughter, who seems to be written primarily to engender pity for the horrific torture supposedly inflicted on her by her brother. Admittedly  my reaction is completely visceral, yet beyond the descriptive carnage of her son's supremely premeditated rampage, I just found myself angry at how it all ended, and wanted nothing more than to dump the book in the trash.

B00005JLEJ|5.0|Kurosawa is the master of the visual, using light, color, motion to evoke magic on the screen. A lot of things in this period piece reminded me of Seven Samurai: warriors on horseback, the dramatic use of weather (wind & rain). In Kagemusha the banners flapping in the breeze is a motif that runs throughout the film. The elegant formal language and ritualistic manners are suffused with the essence of traditional Japan. The battle scenes, with large groups of mounted soldiers, were more epic in scope than the clashes between the seven samurai and the little band of outlaws, but the contrapuntal rhythms were similar.    The credits list Francis Ford Coppola and George Lucas as producers of the foreign release. Donald Richie, who created the subtitles, describes how Kurosawa, rejected by Japanese producers, went abroad in search of support for his long-incubated film and found an enthusiastic audience in these two American admirers of his work. The music by Shinichiro Ikebe even reminded me a little of the Star Wars theme, especially in the final battle scene and its aftermath.    The story, which takes place in 16th century feudal Japan, is complicated and, as I think critic Vincent Canby states, hard to follow. Those with some knowledge of Japanese history will have an advantage.    Shingen Takeda is a warlord (daimyo), the leader of one of three clans (Oda Nobunaga and Tokugawa Ieasu are the others) that have formed an unsteady alliance. The other two band together against Takeda and he attacks their fortress, Noda castle in Kyoto. With their water supply cut off, Shingen hopes to overcome his enemies. His soldiers have heard a flute playing at night in the castle. Shingen decides that if the flute is not heard the next evening, he will attack. He takes up a position on the castle ramparts to listen for the flute and is shot by a sniper.    Shingen is seriously wounded, although his enemies do not know for sure if he is dead or alive. In order to keep them from finding out, and thus forestall an attack by rivals who fear Shingen, his clansmen recruit a condemned criminal who bears a remarkable resemblance to Shingen (played by Tatsuya Nakadai, who also plays Shingen) to be his double--his shadow. There is a precedent for this in that Shingen's brother has acted as his double in the past.    The wounded Shingen is concealed in a palanquin and taken to the Takeda mansion, where he soon expires. The double is installed in his place, with coaching from the clan elders. He has second thoughts when he discovers Shingen's remains in a large funereal urn, but is eventually persuaded to continue in the role.    The ruse is in danger of being exposed when spies from the other two clans observe a boat setting out through the early morning mist on Lake Suwa (where the Lord had requested to be interred) with the enormous urn containing Shingen's remains. They become suspicious, but the Takeda clan concoct a cover story.    The greater challenge is keeping his identity secret from Shingen's own household, since the news, if it spread beyond his inner circle of trusted counselors, would soon reach the Takeda clan's enemies. At first, Shingen's young grandson immediately spots the discrepancy, but he is gradually convinced that the double is really ojiisan (grandpa). Then, when kagemusha is brought to two of Shingen's concubines (or wives, I guess), he blurts out the truth. But they take this as a jest and react with laughter. One of the counselors makes excuses for him: the Lord is too enfeebled to sleep with either of his two favorites that night.    The double begins to identify with his role, growing fond of the little grandson, who explains the meaning of the characters on Shingen's banner (which becomes a leitmotif, appearing in the battle scenes):    hayaki koto kaze no goto ka  shizuka nado koto hayashi no goto ka  kazumeru koto hi no goto ka  ugokazaru koto yama no goto shi    Swift as the wind, quiet as the forest, fierce as the fire, immovable as the mountain.    By now the armies of Nobunaga and Ieyasu are advancing. The advisors hold a war council. The double is told to support the consensus of the advisors and leave the gathering. At the council Shingen's son Katsuyori asks him if he thinks they should attack or not. The double answers, as he believes the Lord would have, \\"Do not move, a mountain does not move.\\"    Katsuyori is furious. He defies the council and attacks Takatenjin castle. The double sits through the battle calmly, inspiring his men to victory.    At last, however, the shadow's deception is exposed when he attempts to ride Shingen's horse and is thrown. The wives, rushing to his aid and seeing his uncovered torso, are shocked to discover that he does not have the Lord's familiar battle scar. The double is given an omiyage (a parting gift) and told to leave.    And now the truth will soon be known to the Tokugawa and Ieyasu forces.    Lord Katsunori, now the acknowledged master of the clan, orders an attack. While the kagemusha, now in rags, watches from the distance with a group of beggars, the Takeda soldiers meet with devastating defeat, and the closing scenes show the battlefield strewn with their bodies and those of their horses. The double wanders onto the scene for a last time and sees the carnage. He picks up a banner and tries to advance but is shot. He staggers to the river, where he sees the clan's flag with its emblematic slogan floating, and dies as he grasps the flag.    While Kagemusha may not rank among Kurosawa's greatest films (Rashomon, Throne of Blood, Ikiru, Seven Samurai) this is nonetheless a showcase of the director's genius. Reportedly, Kurosawa had a falling out with his mainstay star Toshiro Mifune, who had been intended for the part played by Tatsuya Nakadai. Nakadai is a monumental star in his own right. Whether or not Mifune would have been a better choice is a matter for speculation.     Regardless of which actors were chosen, Kagemusha is a must-see for lovers of Japanese cinema. Though it may be difficult to follow at times for American viewers because of the unfamiliar historical references, it is definitely worth the effort.

0071752854|5.0|Sick of sucking up, begging, pleading or over-explaining to win a pitch? In order to get your deal heard have you felt pressure (real or imagined) to kiss a** to people you'd rather you never met?  Now imagine - that you choose your customers and are able to sincerely connect and serve them, walking away from the ones that aren't a fit. Klaff's book will do that and more.<br /><br />\\"Orlen doesn't give a crap about a deal unless the people in it are fun to be with.\\"<br /><br />Orlen Klaff smashes it out of the park with this one. From the moment your brain begins to process his message, you're hooked. You've been pitched, and your curiosity is piqued to read more.<br /><br />Klaff's not so much as writing as he is telling you, one-on-one over a beer or on the golf course what the `real deal' is, and you'll want to know more. I found this book to be engagingly infectious. It had me thinking in `frames' and made me aware of not just what I am saying in everyday conversations, but how I am saying it.<br /><br />Klaff breaks down his pitch style into compartmental steps and uses the S.T.R.O.N.G system which you can read more about in the editorial review above. Pitch Anything explains the brain's amygdala functions and uses similar listening elements as Mark Goulston M.D., identifies in his great book, 'Just Listen'. Klaff borrows from neuroscience principles to get the listener's attention so that she can hear your message.<br /><br />Basically, in just over 200 pages, Pitch Anything will teach you a series of strategies that you can easily employ to shape your pitch, get it heard and close the deal or at least start being heard and truly communicate.<br /><br />It is a shortcut method and it is effective. If you have successfully closed a lot of deals you may well be familiar with Klaff's communication and connection tactics, but not necessarily understand why or how they work. Here you'll get a fine-tuned version of how a master pitches a deal, and there will be many insights that you can apply right away.<br /><br />If you're just beginning to explore getting ways to pitch your idea, this book offers a very solid template. It is especially written for situations where you face time restrictions and a potentially apathetic or bored audience. A fun, fast read with tons of usable insights that'll get your deal heard.If you're just beginning to explore getting ways to pitch your idea, this book offers a very solid template.

Music like this isn't made, it's wrought...woven, cast, smelt, etc. There's majesty, mayhem, surreality and regal attire for all to enjoy. Oh, yes.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|The Review:<br /><br />The last several years have seen a renaissance of the superhero movie and there's never been a better time to be a comic book fanboy.  This is in no small part due to Marvel Studios pulling out all the stops in its efforts to bring its stellar list of heroes and rogues to the big screen.  Now it's Thor's turn and it lives up to the hype.  It brings a cosmic element to the Marvel films and conitinues setting the stage for next year's Avengers movie.  Thor is action packed, and has stellar performances that showcase a tremendously talented cast.<br /><br />Directed by Kenneth Brannaugh and starring Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman, Tom Hiddleston and Sir Anthony Hopkins, Thor overcame a lot of naysayers who questioned how Thor would fare on the big screen.  Marvel has tweeked and updated Thor's origins to better suit the 21st centrury audience. In the comics Thor is the Norse god of thunder who wields the magical hammer called Mjolnir.  In his movie incarnation, Thor and his fellow \\"gods\\" are actually super advanced beings, who as Thor explains, come from, Asgard, a place where science and magic are one and the same.  We mortals dwell in the realm of Midgard, one of the nine known realms.  The frost giants of Jutenheim have been at war with Asgard for a millenium.  That war occasionally spilled out to Midgard and the Asgardians led by Odin defended our primitive ancestors, who perceived the Asgardians as gods.<br /><br />In our time Thor Odinson is a brash young god, hier to the throne of Asgard.  He's Asgard's greatest warrior, but he is also arrogant and headstrong.  Thor's rash actions result in his banishment to Midgard, where he is powerless, but not helpless, while back home Thor's dysfunctional family is engaged in cosmic political intrigue with consequences on an interplanetary scale.  Fantastic special effects and art direction bring the story to life.  Besides its amazing action sequences, Thor succeeds in bringing Asgard, home of the gods to gleaming life.  Part of the set was on on display at the San Diego 2010 Comicon, which was impressive, but on the big screen it's truly unique and awesome.  When you see the halls of Asgard for the first time you will be suitably impressed.<br /><br />The film is split equally between the more cosmic settings of Asgard and Jutenheim and the more mundane Midgard.  I've seen some reviews that have taken issue with the lack of action in the more earthbound parts of the movie, and I could not disagree more as much of this is devoted to genuine character development.  Thor is not an ideal hero, and in true Marvel tradition he has his faults, which in his case, are arrogance and rushing into things with a disregard for the consequences of his actions.  Thor's actions while he's grounded on earth are some of the most entertaining parts of the movie.  It provides for some comic relief and genuinely funny moments as a six and a half foot god used to flying from place to place has to cope with hitching a ride like us mere mortals.<br /><br />Finally, the performances are worth a special mention.  The actors here all brought their A-game. Chris Hemsworth owns the role of Thor and is now as synonymous with this character as Robert Downey Jr. is with Tony Stark.  Anthony Hopkins' rendition of Odin is brilliant and he steals scenes like a master thief. Tom Hiddleston, who plays Loki, also does a tremendous job.  As with all modern Marvel movies, stick around until after the credits roll. There's always an important scene that sets the stage for the next movie.<br /><br />Thor is a winner and has set a thunderous pace for the summer movie season. Fortunately, Marvel will mostly be competing against itself with the impending release of X-men First Class and Captain America.Part of the set was on on display at the San Diego 2010 Comicon, which was impressive, but on the big screen it's truly unique and awesome.

0061989142|4.0|As someone who could always use a few style tricks and an admirer of LC's style on The Hills, I bought this book. As another reviewer mentions, if you have already read others' style books, this one will probably be old news to you. Even I already knew some of her tips (invest in a good pair of black heels, get your clothing tailored, etc.), but for the most part, I do find it to be a helpful reference. This is probably just because I always loved her style on The Hills - as a twenty-something working girl, I too have to dress appropriately for work, nights out, casual dinners, overnight trips, and dates. Lauren covers all of these occassions. I think my favorite section is her sample packing lists for different types of trips (Vegas weekend, NYC work trip, etc). If you're like me and admire Lauren's style, then you'll probably really enjoy this book. My only complaint, which another reviewer says as well, is that all of the clothing photographed in the book are pricey designer pieces, and when Lauren lists her favorite brands of jeans, for exaple, or places to shop, they're all up there too. It would be nice to include some more affordable suggestions or a section on how/where to shop for basics on a budget. Otherwise, this is a fun read with some good tips, and you'll enjoy it if you like Lauren's style.
B003EYVY0E|3.0|Like many others have already posted, I was most disappointed in the lack of an extended edition of this movie.  The fact that you get so much less value for the same price as the first two Ultimate Editions is simply inexcusable.  WB's claims that the producers felt the theatrical version wasn't in need of re-editing is obviously nothing but an excuse.  While I heartily recomend the first two Ultimate Editions, I would advise skipping over #3 and #4 and buy the less expensive Blu-ray versions (which gives you the same movie experience for 1/3 the price), unless you are a compulsive collector.  Hopefully #5-7 will include proper extended editions or this will be my last purchase of the Ultimate Edition series.

030746363X|5.0|The 4-Hour Body: An Uncommon Guide to Rapid Fat-Loss, Incredible Sex, and Becoming Superhuman By Tim Ferriss<br />I recently finished Tim Ferris' latest project and book after hearing raving reviews. I must admit I was pleasantly surprised. I am a big fan of this \\"experimentalist's\\" first book, The  4-Hour workweek, new york times bestseller for 15+ months. By managing to maximize efficiency in business by leveraging time and outsourcing as much time consuming tasks possible we can apparently work 4 hours per week and have the rest of the time to complete case studies on performing super-human tasks and feats. So why not apply this efficient principle to our body!? I like the book and think it's great for anyone looking to make a change in their body. This could be from learning to run or swim more efficiently to adding muscle and building confidence! The book is easy to read, more like a manual or study guide, loaded with fun studies and experiments.<br /><br />Some cool quotes from the book:<br /><br />\\"What's the fastest way for someone to improve their inner game? Improve your outer game.\\" - Richard Branson<br /><br />\\"We seem to have confused comfort with happiness.\\"  - Dean Karnazes<br /><br />The biggest buzz around this book was about this slow carb diet. There is a cult-like following around this paleo style diet. Claims and case studies losing 20+ lbs of fat and gaining muscle in as little as 30 days! All of his studies are based around the theory of The minimum effective dose (MED) is defined simply: the smallest dose that will produce a desired outcome.  I automatically was a little alarmed about the rules and guidelines but as I read into it, I kept in open mind and looked at his perspective with all of his case studies and research that he had completed.  Here is a summary of the slow carb diet from the book: Besides whole foods, anything you put in your mouth or your bloodstream that has an effect is a drug. Treat them all as such.<br /><br />Here is my outline and notes from the book:<br /><br />Four principles of failure-proofing behavior:<br /><br />Rule #1 It's not what you put in your mouth that matters, it's what makes it to your bloodstream. If it passes through, it doesn't count.<br /><br />Rule #2 The hormonal responses to carbohydrates (CHO), protein, and fat are different.<br /><br />  Make it conscious.<br />  Make it a game.<br />  Make it competitive.<br />  Make it small and temporary.<br /><br />Starting a body recomposition program without measurements is like planning a trip without a start address. I guarantee you will regret it later.<br /><br />Photograph all meals or snacks prior to eating. I thought this was cool, at the least it helps your become aware of what you are eating and forces you to take a minute to think about the long term.<br /><br />  \\"what gets measured gets managed\\"<br /><br />Subjects who use food diaries lose three times as much weight as those who don't.<br /><br />Measurement = motivation. Seeing progress in changing numbers makes the repetitive fascinating and creates a positive feedback loop<br /><br />  \\"I just want to be healthy\\" is not actionable.<br /><br />Starting a body recomposition program without measurements is like planning a trip without a start address!!<br /><br />\\"The decent method you follow is better than the perfect method you quit.\\"<br /><br />Rule #1 Avoid \\"White\\" Carbohydrates. (All bread, rice (including brown), cereal, potatoes, pasta, tortillas, and fried food with breading.<br /><br />Rule #2 Eat the Same Few Meals over and over Again.<br /><br />Proteins<br /><br />*Egg whites with 1-2 whole eggs for flavor (or, if organic, 2-5 whole eggs, including yolks)<br /><br />*Chicken breast or thigh<br /><br />*Beef (preferably grass-fed)<br /><br />*Fish Pork Legumes<br /><br />*Lentils (also called \\"dal\\" or \\"daal\\")<br /><br />*Black beans Pinto beans Red beans Soybeans Vegetables<br /><br />*Spinach<br /><br />*Mixed vegetables (including broccoli, cauliflower, or any other cruciferous vegetables)<br /><br />*Sauerkraut, kimchee (full explanation of these later in \\"Damage Control\\") Asparagus Peas Broccoli Green beans Eat as much as you like of the above food items, but keep it simple. Pick three or four meals and repeat them.<br /><br />Eating more frequent meals also appears to have no enhancing effect on resting metabolic rate, despite claims to the contrary.<br /><br />Make sure to have your first meal within an hour of waking. Meals are approximately four hours apart<br /><br />RULE #3 DON'T DRINK CALORIES<br /><br />Do not drink milk (including soy milk), normal soft drinks, or fruit juice. Limit diet soft drinks to no more than 16 ounces per day if you can, as the aspartame can stimulate weight gain.<br /><br />RULE #4 DON'T EAT FRUIT<br /><br />The only exceptions to the no-fruit rule are tomatoes and avocados.  Say no to fruit and its principal sugar, fructose, which is converted to glycerol phosphate more efficiently than almost all other carbohydrates. Glycerol phosphate ' triglycerides (via the liver) ' fat storage.<br /><br />RULE #5 TAKE ONE DAY OFF PER WEEK. (Binging once a week)<br /><br />Dramatically spiking caloric intake in this way once per week increases fat-loss by ensuring that your metabolic rate (thyroid function and conversion of T4 to T3, etc.) doesn't downshift from extended caloric restriction. That's right: eating pure crap can help you lose fat.<br /><br />It is important to spike caloric intake once per week. This causes a host of hormonal changes that improve fat-loss, from increasing cAMP and GMP to improving conversion of the T4 thyroid hormone to the more active T3. Everyone binges eventually on a diet, and it's better to schedule it ahead of time to limit the damage.<br /><br />Against whole grains, a principle from the paleo \\"cave man\\" diet.<br /><br />Discourages consuming any refined soy products, including all soy milk and isolated soy protein supplements.<br /><br />Some fried foods are ok: Stir-fry is ideal for this diet, as are most cuisines (like Thai) that depend on it.<br /><br />On Convenience or \\"eating on the go\\"<br /><br />If you're airport-hopping and cannot find a Mexican restaurant or grill, grab a bag of raw almonds or walnuts at a kiosk and commit to consuming no starch.<br /><br />Most airports also have chicken salads (omit dressings besides olive oil or vinegar) that you can combine with the nuts. If it comes down to it, choose mild hunger instead of deviation.<br /><br />Having followed this diet in 30+ countries, I can state without exception that travel is not a legitimate excuse for breaking the rules.<br /><br />Interesting tips when eating too much and/or binging:<br /><br />Have as much of the crap ingested either go into muscle tissue or out of the body unabsorbed.  He suggests  focusing on three principles:<br /><br />PRINCIPLE #1 Minimalize the release of insulin, a storage hormone<br /><br />Steps to manage Insulin release:  minimized by blunting sharp jumps in blood sugar. Using enzymes and citic juices to aid in moving the food.<br /><br />PRINCIPLE #2 Increase the speed of gastric emptying, or how quickly food exits the stomach<br /><br />Accomplished primarily through enzymes, caffeine, and yerba mate tea<br /><br />PRINCIPLE #3 Engage in brief muscular contraction throughout the day<br /><br />For muscular contractions, my default options are air squats, wall presses, push-ups, etc.. You may ask, \\"Why the hell would you want to do 60-90 seconds of funny exercises a few minutes before you eat and, ideally, again about 90 minutes afterward?\\"<br /><br />Because it brings glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT-4) to the surface of muscle cells, opening more gates for the calories to flow into.<br /><br />Interesting Section on Losing the Final 5-10 Pounds<br /><br />Removing even a little dairy can dramatically accelerate fat-loss!<br /><br />Macadamia oil is the new and improved olive oil.<br /><br />There should be no need, or real physical urge, to eat snacks. If you are hungry, you're not eating enough protein and legumes at each meal.<br /><br />Eating a balance protein rich meal every three waking hours: Like natural shake, clean lean meat, fish, eggs, or salad.<br /><br />Balancing Bacteria for Fat Loss<br /><br />  Get off the Splenda.<br />  Go fermented.<br />  Consider probiotics and prebiotics.<br /><br />Lemon juice lowers glycemic response. Three tablespoons of fresh-squeezed lemon juice just prior to eating appeared to lower blood sugar peaks by approximately 10%.<br /><br />Cinnamon, even in small doses, has a substantial effect on glucose levels. One and a half teaspoons. Don't consume more per day.<br /><br />And another hot topic, Brazil Nuts - Tim points out in his studies, that supplementing with a few brazil nuts which are one of the highest sources of selenium have positive effects on the body. From what I've found brazil nuts carry mood and testosterone boosting benefits. The selenium in the nuts is required for synthesis and metabolism of the thyroid hormones, thus effecting energy, feel good chemicals, sperm count, and testosterone.<br /><br />Brazil nuts are high in fat and calories... so a few goes along way. I use them in smoothies and actually made some good brazil nut milk with the vitamix by soaking them adding water, vanilla, and mixing. After blended, I squeezed through mesh cloth and made a delicious powerhouse dessert with the leftover meat from the milk.<br /><br />More than quality, it's the size and speed of meals that determined glycemic response. The easiest thing you can do to decrease glucose spikes is slow down. It also helps to drink more water to dilute digestion, eat smaller portions, and chew more.<br /><br />\\"For fastest fat-loss, minimize your blood sugar bumps above 100 to no more than two per day. \\"<br /><br />Supplements suggested for 4 hour body diet:<br /><br />Tim suggests a cocktail of health boosting supplements to maximize efficiancy of fat burning, digestion, antioxidant, energy transformation, muscle and joint pain prevention.

The book references studies from The China Study and some other popular strength and endurance athletes who eat plant based.  -<br /><br />What I took from the diet is that \\"primarily plant-based diet (what I'll refer to as \\"PPBD\\") makes most sense.<br /><br />This includes 5 Steps:<br /><br />Step 1 Remove starches (rice, bread, grains) and add legumes. Dense products, like black bean burgers without buns, are encouraged.<br /><br />Step 2 Ensure that all of your meat is pasture-raised, grass-fed, or sourced within 50 miles of your home.<br /><br />Step 3 Eat meat only after 6:00 P.M.

Cinnamon, even in small doses, has a substantial effect on glucose levels. One and a half teaspoons. Don't consume more per day.    And another hot topic, Brazil Nuts - Tim points out in his studies, that supplementing with a few brazil nuts which are one of the highest sources of selenium have positive effects on the body. From what I've found brazil nuts carry mood and testosterone boosting benefits. The selenium in the nuts is required for synthesis and metabolism of the thyroid hormones, thus effecting energy, feel good chemicals, sperm count, and testosterone.    Brazil nuts are high in fat and calories... so a few goes along way. I use them in smoothies and actually made some good brazil nut milk with the vitamix by soaking them adding water, vanilla, and mixing. After blended, I squeezed through mesh cloth and made a delicious powerhouse dessert with the leftover meat from the milk.    More than quality, it's the size and speed of meals that determined glycemic response. The easiest thing you can do to decrease glucose spikes is slow down.

Step 2 Ensure that all of your meat is pasture-raised, grass-fed, or sourced within 50 miles of your home.    Step 3 Eat meat only after 6:00 P.M.

B001UV4XHY|3.0|You know the feeling when you come in late in a movie - say miss the first 5 minutes?  You never feel like you've caught up with the plot.  You feel frustrated and confused the entire time.  You want to ask someone, \\"Who are these people, what are they doing, and why are they doing it?  What did I miss?\\"<br /><br />That's how I felt with this movie.  Since I was watching the DVD, obviously I didn't come in 5 minutes late, but it felt like it.  I felt I had missed part of the plot, and never quite caught up with the story line.  I believe the cut scene at the start, when Harry is talking with his aunt, would have helped, but it still might have felt this way.<br /><br />None of the others did this.  I always felt I came in at the beginning, and was able to follow the plot.<br /><br />This movie has to be watched if one is going to have any clue at all when Part II comes out, but I was (for the first time in the series) very disappointed.<br /><br />No, I haven't read the books.  However, one should not have to read the books to understand the movies.  They should be true to the books, but not depend on them for comprehending the plot.

B001UV4XI8|5.0|Great purchase! I love Harry Potter and this is definitely the best Potter film yet. And the Blu-Ray features are great. The Maximum Mode version of the movie is an incredible new way for serious Harry Potter fans to experience the movie. I only wish that there were special features on the DVD version and not just the Blu-Ray version. But it's definitely worth every penny!
0736083863|5.0|As a Pilates educator, I am always on the lookout for good reference books to use whilst teaching Pilates anatomy classes in my studio's instructor certification program. This text is an excellent resource for trainee Pilates instructors and certified instructors, alike. It is written by Rael Isakowitz, Pilates practitioner and author, and Karen Clippinger, a dance/Pilates professor and author of Dance Anatomy and Kinesiology. Together, they tackle Pilates-applied anatomy in a useful and straightforward way, using examples directly from the Pilates mat repertoire. They offer many detailed and clear explanations, accompanied by illustrations, drawings and charts, which help the reader to visualize and contextualize the anatomical knowledge with Pilates applications. I urge Pilates instructors and students alike to purchase this book for their reference libraries.

0439023521|4.0|The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins is a phenomenal work that provides an excellent escape for any reader. Through incredible artistry in detail the reader can find themselves lost in the adventure of the protagonist and completely lose track of time and reality. For anyone looking to read a novel that provides a great tone and flows perfectly, look no further. In addition to that, the vocabulary used in the book is practically universal for all readers in the targeted audience. For a person like myself who doesn't normally read, I was shocked at how easy it was to get through this book, and how enjoyable the process was. I have never been so enthralled by a book and I wish I had read it sooner. I will definitely be reading the sequels in the near future.
1439190275|1.0|Concept is good and works-this new book seems to be all about marketing and financial rewards rather than weight loss.<br /><br />The original works and is easy/uncomplicated.<br /><br />This book is a hassle and will probably not do much-in terms of weight loss-over what the original text will do.<br /><br />Very diappointed
0307454541|4.0|Whoa, whoa, whoa............... This book was AMAZING!!! sure there was a few scenes that I had to read with my hand clasped over my eyes (which isn't easy by the way), but I couldn't put it down. This isn't for the faint of heart, or for those with easily (or not so easily) offended sensibilities, but it's a good read. In fact, I think I'll read it again before I start on book 2

B004SC7B6M|3.0|First off, I own every Within Temptation album, my favorites being `Mother Earth' and `The Silent Force' and my least favorite being `The Heart of Everything'.  This is a pretty hard album to review as, while it's evident WT are trying to do something different and seem passionate in the recording, at the end of the day you're left with overly-simplified pop songs of somewhat recycled material, laced with lyrics that will grate you the more and more you notice them.  If I would have rated this album on the second listen I would have easily given it a 4, if not a 5, and that's the inherent flaw with the album: quickly diminishing returns.  I will say I have no problem with the sound they are exploring on this album and I think the whole comic book concept was refreshing, if a little odd.  The music here is definitely more upbeat, less metal, and poppier than anything else they've done, which is pretty much what I expected; the flaw is not in the sound but in the songs, which frankly aren't that well-written and don't hold up well to repeated listenings.  All of these songs have gorgeous vocals (as expected), some very catchy hooks and would definitely work perfectly well in a concert setting (especially for people who've never heard of WT) but, as someone who expects more musical evolution between albums from all of my favorite bands, I'm a little disappointed by the album and don't really foresee myself throwing this on that much in the future .  That is, again, why I'm mixed on this album, because this new sound does have potential to suit them well and is a small step in an unexpected territory, it's just unfortunate how a lot of the songs are unmemorable and do not contain really any new musical ideas.  However, I did enjoy a handful of songs and there is enough potential in this album for me not to officially give up on WT yet, so here's hoping they take a greater step forward with their next album.

B004EPZ070|4.0|I went and seen this movie on mothers day... I had recently finished reading the book that the movie is based on (FYI I loved the book it was amazing)  I am always worried about reading a book then seeing how its adapted into a film how much it will be changed and if it will loose its charm... this movie has lots of change and they went in mannny different darections then the book but to my saprize it worked it was cute and charming and you heart realy akes for these caractors and you dont realy no what darection to feel or who to rout for... I loved the acting i think they casted realy well expeshaly Ginnifer Goodwin as Rachel she was vulnrable and loveable and the perfect pic... but my most fav part of the whole movie was without a doubt was John Krasinski as Ethan who in the book has a much smaller role but they gave him a larger role in the movie and that was definantly the best move they could have made he was perfect you cant help but fall in love with his caractor he just dose it so perfectly.   now the only reasons im gunna give this a 4 insetead of a 5 is because of 3 reasons... some things felt realy rushed to me I think they should have taked a little more time to give us a larger view of the whole thing (but this is said as a reader of the book so I no the story in detail so my view is different from someone who hasent) and second I think that Steve Howey was fantastic but the darection they took his caractor was a bit disapointing but Steve still did a fantastic job with it! and the 3rd reason is the ending a good ending i just wish it was exactly like the book ending but its a little diferent.... but all an all a great chick flick it reaches a topic that not manny others have done and i like that!!! i hope they make something blue!
B0006A9FKA|5.0|This movie is my favorite movie of any kind. Not just the genre, but the absolute classic riot that this is. It really has to go down as the greatest zombie movie and perhaps the greatest comedy of all time. The characters are likeable, they have the right amount of swearing, you see people die...the only thing this movie lacks of s(e)x, but it really makes up for it with their innuendos. If you haven't seen it then GO WATCH IT RIGHT NOW!!! I first watched it 3 years ago and to this day my sister and I still reference it, like we randomly say \\"You've got red on you.\\" I didn't really like Hot Fuzz that much, but this movie is killer!<br /><br />5/5<br /><br />John McAdam:<br />Were Ancient Gods From Other Planets?<br />Am I Mad or Coherent?<br />The Surgeon With Glasses<br />Confucius Say

B004IFYN2E|3.0|Having gone initially to the theatre to see THE TOURIST primarily to view the chemistry and performances of Depp and Jolie, we had found the movie predictable and drag-y.  Catching it at home on a second viewing, we discovered its fun, found the chemistry we had been too impatient to concentrate upon and discovered we had a really good time with the film.  We still found the tour of Venice a bit 1960-I SPY-ish, and the direction uneven.  However the stars did shine more brightly than on first viewing and the surrounding players  made it an enjoyable evening.  Sometimes we need to see a film a second time to discover its virtues for the first time.  .Blue Ray in the home, a really good pizza and a nice Chianti:  Now that's a good investment!
0385341679|3.0|I found the author's fever series to be a fantastic series -- a page-turner, that I just couldn't put down.  But I have to say that the ending was disappointing, weak, and rushed.  That's too bad.  I loved the series.
0894803123|4.0|I have always loved Ben & Jerry's ice cream - in my view the best ice cream you can buy in a store.  The flavours and the chunks really set them apart.      The recipe book gives you recipes for some of their true favourites - such as Cookie Dough and Heath Bar Crunch.  The book was written in 1987 so thats more than 20 years of new (?) flavours the book doesn't cover.  So the majority of the recipes I don't think I have seen in the stores - including beer sorbet...      On the other hand, if you want a true reference guide that is going to help you make really great ice cream, I recommend you look at Ice Cream: The Whole Scoop.      But at $10 - who can pass up getting really B&J recipes - so I got both!
0439023491|5.0|All three Hunger Games books are amazing. I don't even know which one was my favorite, they were all great! I couldn't stop reading them. Best books I've ever read! I'm upset I'm finished them....I guess I will re-read them!
B001UV4XFG|3.0|After New Moon, I am not really expecting too much from the Twilight series anymore, however after saying that, I must admit that Eclipse was a decent film.  It took me a long time to watch it due to the fact that Eclipse is my favorite book in the series and I didn't want to watch it get murdered on screen.  But like the title depicts, they did a very rushed job of highlighting the main points while still staying true to the main point of the story.  It seemed very rushed, but I appreciated that they kept some things in even if it was a side note.  As far as Breaking Dawn goes, I think the movies will only make the book look better.  I was not a fan, so thanks to Eclipse, I will be giving Breaking Dawn a chance now.  :)
B004SEVPWQ|4.0|I love this game. Excellent physics and graphics. Big lag when network opponent leaves mid-game though. You might wait minutes before you find out. Occasionally the cue doesn't pass between players timely either.

030745455X|4.0|Like many people on here, I liked this one more than the first.  Not that I didn't like the first one, but this book more centers on Lisbeth and her past.  Plus I am a huge fan of computers and mathematics which is more prevalent in this story.  I definitely recommend this book to anyone who likes a longer and more detailed mystery.
B004J4WN0I|5.0|I loved this book and I can't wait for the next one. I am so glad that we only have a month to wait between books.     I connected to all of the characters and just loved the story. I wish the book had been out when I went to Arizona a couple of years ago. I would have hit the Rula Bula and said hi to Kevin's cousin who owns the comic book store where Atticus owns his store. My favorite secondary charater is the Widow. Who doesn't want a neighbor who offers a drink first thing in the morning and will help you hide a body!

0756404738|4.0|Wise Man's Fear picks up right where its predecessor left off, with the grown-up Kvothe, in hiding for reasons that haven't yet been revealed, recounting further chapters of the story of his younger self.    That story also picks up where it left off. If Rothfuss's first novel, The Name of the Wind, was a coming-of-age tale set in a fantasy world, well, this novel is one, too. Kvothe, the gifted, but hot-tempered young protagonist, continues his education, first as an arcanist at the University, then as an aide to a powerful noble, then training with a warrior people who have their own challenging spiritual/martial philosophy. Being Kvothe, he does nothing halfway, making new friends, new enemies, and people who are a bit of both. There's even a section where he learns the art of lovemaking in a typically larger-than-life way.    The rewards (and frustrations) of this novel probably won't surprise anyone who's finished the first book. As before, Rothfuss does a fine job developing his characters, lending their world both a firm seriousness and plenty of touches of humor. As before, he takes his sweet time with the story, devoting many pages to even relatively minor events in Kvothe's life. Fortunately, it's hard not to like the protagonist or relate to his journey, even though he's more than a bit full of himself (then again, this is what usually gets him into trouble).    However, these indulgences on the part of the author mean that the book can't help but feel a bit overstuffed. By the end, Rothfuss has gotten through a number of episodes in Kvothe's backstory, yet how they relate to the present-day story or why they matter... we still don't know. The author is asking for a leap of faith -- can he deliver on the other side? Also, I'm probably not the only reader who's grown impatient with Kvothe and Denna's relationship: unresolved sexual tension can only be sustained for so long before the writer runs out of excuses, and what was charming simply becomes irritating.    All in all, though, even if Rothfuss didn't move his main story forward very much, a big book of character-defining adventures still made for absorbingly pleasurable reading. I just wonder how he'll be able to bring his carefully-established threads to a suitable close in just one more book, without it feeling rushed.
B004TL0J5M|1.0|As is almost always the case with Michael Connelly, his writing is top shelf. He's masterful at keeping the reader guessing right up until the last page. So the book is 5 Stars. No need for me to comment further on the book as others have done so rather eloquently.     What prompted me to write my first review is the predatory pricing by Amazon on it's Kindle editions. Why does a digital version cost more than a hardback? It's makes no sense other than they can get away with it as long as we agree to pay the price. Despite my having read over 100 books on Kindle this will be my last until and unless they re-think their pricing policy.
B000F5GNX8|1.0|I purchased this movie after reading the positive reviews on Amazon. All I can say is that I wish I had watched the movie that they saw. This movie is terrible. Robert Downing Jr not only wasn't funny but talked constantly. The plot was confusing and the characters unlikeable. This movie tries too hard to be \\"west coast Hollywood cool\\" and ends up being shallow and a little offensive.

Her first baby, a girl, was taken from her by her husband Jasu and never seen again.  In her poor farming village, a girl is a liability, no use in the fields and a drain on the husband's finances.  When the midwife hears Kavita's labor pains, she comes to assist her ... deliver another baby girl.  Kavita makes the midwife promise not to let her husband take the baby, then makes her husband promise to give her one night alone with the baby. She and her sister Rupa make the long, difficult journey to Mumbai to take the baby, whom Kavita named Usha (dawn) to an orphanage.  At least there, Kavita knows her baby will be taken care of; it's the most she can do to keep her safe.<br /><br />Meanwhile, in America, Stanford-educated doctors Somer and Krishnan have been married five years when they have a miscarriage which leads to Somer's diagnosis of early menopause at 31 years old. As she and Krishnan cope with the news, they eventually decide to adopt.  Kris's mother is a patron of the orphanage in Bombay, and they go through the long, involved process which eventually gives them their new baby, now named Asha due to an error in paperwork at the orphanage.<br /><br />This novel spans 20 years and interweaves the stories of Kavita and her family with those of Somer and hers.  I didn't care for Somer at all, she comes across as a sniveler: wishy-washy, weak, and self-pitying, and honestly, if the story had been only about her, I probably wouldn't have wanted to keep reading.  Kavita's story, however, is fascinating.  She is a good woman who suffers through a difficult life and perseveres with hope.  She never gives up on her \\"secret daughter\\", and as she eventually finds herself in the same city as the orphanage, she visits often, looking through the gate in hopes of catching a glimpse of the daughter she loved enough to give up.<br /><br />With glimpses of the lives lived in the slums of India, and of the hardships faced by women living in poverty there, contrasted with the lives of families like Krishnan's well-to-do circle, a much broader appreciation of India as a whole and the strength of it's people are readily found.<br /><br />As Asha's story comes full circle, Somer finally grows up, and as a reader, you feel pride in the woman Asha turns out to be.<br /><br />QUOTES<br /><br />Kavita is anxious, her stomach unsettled.

1601251505|4.0|A word about myself, as I believe all reviews are biased based on one's preferences and history with gaming:<br /><br />I am a loyal D&D fan and I have played the game since 1980. I play other games too, but D&D is and always will be the \\"mother ship\\" for me. I return to it frequently. I am a role player first and foremost, therefore I do not min/max and spend little time focusing on power exploits or rule mongering. I tend to GM more than actually play and I gravitate to groups that are friendly and RP-focused as well.<br /><br />This means my review is biased from the perspective of a gamer that isn't focused on power curves and is more focused on the overall elegance of the system and ease at which I can continue to use older material. I also judge on how complete the volume is, in other words, does the purchase provide everything I need as a GM/player to learn the system and start role playing right away?<br /><br />I purchased the Pathfinder CORE Rulebook very recently (May 2011) and read much of it this weekend. The purchase was made with some trepidation for the following reasons:<br /><br />1. I have a wealth of 3.5 material already, so I was unsure I even \\"needed\\" this product.<br />2. I have always been loyal to D&D proper and wanted to give 4th Edition (and WOTC) a fair shot.<br /><br />I can say, quite happily that despite these reservations I am most pleased with my purchase. Here is why:<br /><br />1. The product does improve certain aspects of 3.5. In particular combat maneuvers and grappling and the like are greatly improved and simplified and some of the classes that needed a little more punch, got tweaked in that direction. In short, Pathfinder's system is an improved revision of 3.5. So I was glad I made the investment.<br /><br />2. For me, 4th Edition is just a nightmare to adjudicate on the gaming table. For a system that bragged about its simplification, I wound up having to put all kind of pennants on our minis to track things. Also, while some of the designs and aspects of 4th Edition are interesting, the books are all fractured. I am also never quite sure what a particular 4th Edition book holds, it never seems complete. I felt, after a while, the value was just not there. So I was ready to migrate back to 3.5 and looked to Pathfinder to bring in some fresh perspective on the 3.5 system and was very pleased with what I got.<br /><br />3. In relation to points 1 & 2, Pathfinder is just simply a better value.<br /><br />4. The book is well-written, often written more clearly and concisely than the new D&D books, which often looked rushed. There are mistakes in the Pathfinder Book, but in general, its a tighter book, someone spent more time editing this book and seemed to care more about it. The D&D books, in contrast look rushed.<br /><br />5. The book has a nice style and design. Pathfinder's tone and style seems to blend traditional D&D with a 21st century update. The art is often simple, but often a perfect accent to the section or page you are reading. It features a unique blend of art, some of it appears to be acrylic/oil paintings, while other seem to be produced digitally. In contrast, the art design in 4th Edition can't compete. In particular the covers of the 4th Edition tell the story of the poor art direction, D&D looks too much like a sku you'd by at a shopping mall. Pathfinder looks like a sku you'd find at a gaming store.<br /><br />6. After purchasing the book, I was pleased to see the Pathfinder Community is rich. There is a treasure trove of web sites, forums, tool sets and utilities available online, as well as wikis, reference material and campaign guides. While 4th Edition has these as well, the more creative gamers (especially the role players, which interest me most) have all seemed to have adopted Pathfinder.<br /><br />7. My core book has Gnomes. The fact WOTC intentionally left core stuff out of their basic books, as a scheme to make you buy more crap is an insult. Insults likethis should not be rewarded with my continued business. There is some redemption in Pathfinder, it's a reward for treating gamers with respect that quality should be rewarded more readily than just a brand name.<br /><br />8. All of my 3.5 books and material fuses easily into this system, with almost little effort.<br /><br />I have complaints about the book as well. Some rules were not cleaned up or simplified as much as I would have liked. Also the Druid class seems a little broken and I am still not pleased with how Bards function. There was a movement in 3.0 to convert a Bard into a lore master, rather than someone that just sings songs to enchant/infatuate enemies. That slow conversion never progressed and in 3.75 I find the Bard's concept rather lacking. That's a very personal beef though and I would wager those who love Bards must be quite content with 3.75.<br /><br />I also think that the new rules on \\"dying\\" make Pathfinder very easy for players to survive. I don't like to kill characters regularly, but from time to time, I think a character death can accentuate the \\"danger\\" and create a little tension which only incites better RP. With the revised rules on dying and with the cleric's new 60-foot diameter healing pulse, players can survive encounters much more easily than before. As a GM, I can adjust, but I may have to house these rules a little too.<br /><br />Finally, I do not like the Reaver Miniatures that accompany Pathfinder. I understand how and why the choice was made, but I find as I age, I do not have the time to glue and paint metal figs. The metal figs I have glued and painted in the past need constant maintenance too. I desperately wish either WOTC or Paizo would explore pre-painted miniatures again. I have over 1000 of them already, but despite the fact my closet is full, I still crave more. They are not only convenient in that I do not have to glue or paint them, they even transport more effectively and rarely tarnish, break or require maintenance.<br /><br />But my misgivings are really minor compared to my overall enthusiasm for the book. The Pathfinder Core Rules is a superb value for any tabletop fantasy gamer, it presents a more elegant system than 4th Edition and it does so with an eye towards the customer: it makes sure you get everything you need and expect from your purchase.<br /><br />I don't want to say D&D has \\"jumped the shark\\", because I believe WOTC will come to its senses and eventually bring D&D back to a better place. If the retailers I know in this industry are any indication, D&D's sales are lackluster compared to where they were just 5 or 6 years ago, so the marketplace will force them to improve their quality and assess their overall direction.<br /><br />Until then, we have Paizo to guide us into the light and I am so very grateful for them for carrying the torch.'s a reward for treating gamers with respect that quality should be rewarded more readily than just a brand name.    8.

630542845X|3.0|This could've been a lot better but there are holes in the storyline and the acting doesn't mesh. I think that the director dropped the ball. Also, \\"Powder's\\" makeup was too obviously powder. A pet peeve of mine is why does every person in a movie who happens to be different, have to be portrayed as a genius at something? Can't there be a genetic throwback/forward who is just a regular person?
B00335EQ0E|5.0|Truly one of the greats, this is still a timelss masterpiece. I enjoyed it as much today as I did 50 years ago!
B004LAIU4I|5.0|I had never heard any of Paul Simon's songs before this album and I am so glad that I stumbled upon it. Wondeful album, great lyrics and melody. Particularly tracks 1,2,6 and 10 are the gems of this album. The rest are also great. Great choise for people who appreciate good music!
0756404738|4.0|I loved TNTW but have very mixed emotions about WMF.  It seemed to drag in spots, actually throughout most of the book.  It sppears to be a set of stories about separate adventures with little threading them together, except the story-telling, which is becoming rather boring. I am accustomed to a series of books being a \\"wow!\\" followed by a \\"so?\\" followed by a \\"wow\\".  Herbert's \\"Dune\\" series stuck me that way.  This book is a \\"so?\\"  I'm hoping for a \\"wow\\" next book, which I will certainly read.    I guess I just expected a little more from such an accomplished writer.  Three stars seems too little and four stars seem too much.  I wish I could award half stars.  I will go with my admiration for the writer and give four stars.
B00275EGWY|2.0|I admit I didn't watch the whole thing. I had to turn it off after the guy---no body armor, but ACU pants that weren't being issued at the time, which would have gotten him killed----left the base with a gun to a civilian's head.  As it happens, two of the guys in my squad did something like that just prior to us new guys arriving. They went to a party, they carried unauthorized weapons, and for most of the rest of the tour they were on extra duty and restriction. Then the insurgency exploded, and going outside the wire just became a laughable idea.<br /><br /> Where do I start, where do I start? The part where the officer stands next to a big huge brand-new looking, definitely FULL burlap sack in the street and nobody notices RIGHT AWAY? Did I mention this guy's EOD? And it's 2004 in Iraq, when everybody learned exactly what IED meant? The one-vehicle excursion out into the desert? The mercenaries, also in one vehicle? Jeez, does Fallujah, April 4th, 2004 ring any bells? Aside from which, leaving base---in one vehicle for the soldiers, if not for the mercs-----was strictly forbidden, simply because it was the best way to get yourself killed. The soldiers knew this, too.  You had to have a convoy, you had to have a certain number of soldiers, certain numbers and types of weapons, and certain procedures. This wasn't drill and ceremony; this was stuff that would keep you alive. And any realistic soldier recognized that a lot of that stuff made sense.<br /><br />  And then there's the scene where they get trapped by snipers in a building eight hundred meters away, who can blow away a merc with a tough shot yet can't take out the lead character's buddy once he takes off his helmet. And for that matter, they DON'T take out the guy who's taking them out. If they can see well enough to hit the turret gunner in the jugular then they can take out the dude who just took off his Kevlar.<br /><br />  I had to turn it off. I'm going to guess it didn't get much better. The bottom line is, if you have to change the reality of the story that much to tell your story, there's something wrong with the story. That's the writer's fault, and sure it makes their job easy, but that's the job. This kind of laziness reminds me of way Stephen King uses telepathy in all his books because otherwise he'd have to actually explain certain things and write maybe three hundred more pages. You have to wonder why, if they want to write about the military so much, they make it so fake.<br /><br /> Some people don't grasp this idea. It's honesty. It's hard work. Artistically, I'd say there's different kinds of honesty. There's every I dotted, every T crossed accuracy.  Then there's emotional honesty,  where you follow the spirit of something rather than the letter of it. This is what movie makers use a lot, yet this movie has neither. If you can't get the details right, the basic facts of military life, then something's wrong with your story.  It's not the military that's the problem; it's the fact that you can't get it right, that the story you want to tell can't be made to fit the framework you've chosen for it. A lot of civilians get the military wrong, thinking it's matter of picking which extreme to place the story at. But they miss all the gray areas in the middle, all the perfectly ordinary people in the military who do extraordinary things, and I think a lot of people flinch from that complexity.  Even today, members of the military are either saints or villains to people, and this movie was an attempt to capitalize on a third role: that of suffering---or angry---survivor. Yet Renner's character was just a smug, arrogant bad boy, more of a Tom Cruise character than anything original.<br /><br />\\"Black Hawk Down\\" which had its flaws, still remains the mark to beat, and this one didn't even come close.ave to change the reality of the story that much to tell your story, there's something wrong with the story.

0060734191|5.0|While this isn't among my top 3-4 series that I have read (Lord of the Rings, Game of Thrones, Name of the Wind, and Pentagast-main character not name of book- mysetery series) this is right below that.  It is very cleaver with great characters, unique style of magic, and well crafted world.  While I like the Lord of the Rings style fiction I really don't like stock characters and character types.  I also loose interest fast when there is a ton of over the top magic.  This series wins out in all of those themes.  Magic is suggested and showen to be a part of daily life but there aren't people throwing fireballs at each other all the time.  Biggest thing to me though is that this is cleaver storytelling and I care about the characters.  Highly recommend.
0143113100|5.0|Dr. Doidge presents stunning and fascinating case studies to illustrate an evolving and truly exciting area of brain research.  One might be tempted to pass by this book as another dry review of a medical topic by a medical doctor.  That would be a mistake!  This is a page turner!  Dr. Doidge is not only a brilliant physician and brain scientist he is also an accomplished and interesting author.  This wonderfully insightful and hopeful book is definitely worth the read.
030746363X|3.0|A friend said it sounded interesting and since he's an avid reader I purchased it for him, so waiting on the review.
0316069353|5.0|Another hit by Michael Connelly. I really like the Lincoln Lawyer novels better than the Harry Bosch ones. This one was excellent and was on a topic that is on most folk's minds. It had some good twist to it. Enjoy!
B00012QM8G|5.0|This film encompasses all that is remarkable about film-making. The sound, the visual contrasts- everything is perfect. Furthermore, after seeing it for the 7th time, I look forward to watching it again. Schindler's List is the most moving film I've ever seen. This should be required viewing for everyone who breathes in and out.
0307279189|5.0|Maybe the best running book ever written. I read this book at the beginning of training for my first marathon. And I'm glad I did. It offer a great perspective on endurance running. But it's so much more. Highly recommended.

B0011HOEY4|5.0|Wow.  After a glut of mediocre movies, how satisfying to find an intelligent, superbly shot and edited movie that works on several levels, and telling a true story to boot.  Denzel Washington plays Frank Lucas, the Harlem drug lord who started as driver and general right hand man to the previous drug King of Harlem.  When his boss dies, Lucas brings a business ethic - capitalist thinking that any business school would be proud of, to the business.  Rebuilding the drug trade without relying on the middle men or the Mafia, and undercutting the competition, he created a brand name - a business success story as it were.  He uses a sound business model to beat the previously untoppled opposition.  If he is presented as a superb businessman, we also see him as a violent man, almost a thug, when `necessary'.   Make no mistake - this is not a film about action scenes, but where there is violence (and that means from the very first scene) it is stark and brutal., and not for the fainthearted.  Russell Crowe on the other hand plays a cop - and in 70's Harlem, a real oddity - he's an honest cop, a man of integrity in his job.  Being an honest cop means he is the only one in a position to head up a new task force, hand picked by Crowe, to make major arrests to stem the drug flow into the city - and he sets his sights on Lucas' organisation.  What's fascinating about the movie is the comparison of the two men.  In the same way `Heat' had flawed characters that refused to be stereotyped into pure good and pure bad, we equally have realistic characters here that make you uncomfortable.  We admire Lucas's business acumen and honesty in his relationship, and find ourselves trying to excuse his bursts of violence.   And on the other hand we admire the integrity of Crowe's cop, handing in a million bucks to do `the right thing', and ultimately confronting corruption in the cops (as exemplified in Josh Brolin's caharacter) even when it means alienating himself from his colleagues... and yet at the same time his marriage is a mess as he is a serial adulterer.. so is he a man if integrity when he can't bring the same uprightness into his marriage..?  His wife feels the very pain as a victim of dishonesty of her husband at home, that he seeks so hard to stamp out at work.  It's a fascinating character study that refuses to airbrush out flaws, but those very same dichotomies in the individuals make the ending so much more understandable, and indeed, plausible.  Beyond these two, there are very few niggling problems - the wives are not well written and although important in the men's lives we never get a feel of what really makes them tick.  The length may put some people off - but I watched the extended version, which was 2 hours 38 minutes, and it flew past for me.  The highlight of the movie is probably the moment, as in Heat, when the two men meet and have their head to head.  The dénouement turns out not to be a Scarface orgy of violence, but something quite unexpected (unless you know the story already).  This movie passed me by at the cinema for some reason, and what a shame.  For this is intelligent moviemaking for adults, multilayered fare to stimulate discussion and thought.  It's not an easy watch - the violence is sudden, strong and senseless, there is nudity, sex and violence, and the characters are not cuddly white hat and dark hat ciphers.  Instead we have a morally murky movie that actually tells a layered story, a story examining both character and capitalism .  It's a `[[ASIN:B0017HRJ04 Heat [Blu-ray]]]'-like period meld of `[[ASIN:B00006JU7T Serpico (Widescreen Edition)]]' and a Harlem `[[ASIN:B0018CMJSU The Godfather - The Coppola Restoration Giftset DVD]]', depending whose viewpoint you favour in the movie, and a welcome intelligent addition to the period crime genre.
B004E2XAHK|4.0|I'm a relative newcomer to Within Temptation.  The Heart of Everything was the first album of theirs I've had.  This follow up is incredibly good.  Each song is crisp, tight, and loaded with layered sounds of strings, choirs, etc.  The vocals are top notch as well.  Perhaps the one drawback is the simplicity of the lyrics, and the overall similarity sound from song to song.  When I listen to this all the way through, the songs feel indistinguishable from each other.  But when each track is solid and enjoyable, it's but a small gripe.  I initially got tuned into these guys/gal due to Evanescence.  So, if you like them, I can't imagine why you wouldn't love Within Temptation.  Worth checking out!!

B0042EJD8A|5.0|This is a documentary, explaining how caustic, dangerous chemicals are pumped into the ground with water to break up the shale that conceals the sought-after natural gas. After the shale is separated and the gas is available, all the chemicals used to free the gas are pumped or drained into the nearby rivers and streams. Pennsylvania, so far, along with some Western states are the unfortunate recipients of this pollution. The video shows in accurate and graphic terms how this is taking place unabated.  Currently, the CEO of Exxon has  an unending commercial trying to say that the exploration and harvesting of this natural gas is safe. They have the resources to convince the general public that this fragging is safe, when, in reality, the video shows many examples of the harm it has done.

B000UBMWG4|3.0|Just wanted to FYI people to a few things -    First the Disc 1/Disc 5 Final Cut/Workprint problem is NOT exclusive to Amazon.com.   Second it wasnt a 'small' batch. It was a large batch.  Third almost 2 years later, this problem is STILL happening.    I just bought this set from Target for $29.99. Disc 1 labeled \\"Final Cut\\" is actually the Workprint Disc 5. I called Warner and a new BRD will arrive in 1-2 weeks, no charge and I dont have to return anything.    ONLY THE MOST HARDCORE FANS should endevour this task. You're 50/50 on getting the correct discs in the set. And with gas being ~$4 a gallon, can you afford driving back and forth 1-4x? If you are a completist like I am, you want ALL the cuts, so you have to invest 1-2 weeks getting the Final Cut (it's worth it BTW) or you can just buy the 2-disc Final Cut Blu-Ray if you just want the final version (and best version).    I gave this 3 stars since the movie and quality is great. But 2 years later, the quality control is STILL crap.
B000BJ7BCA|5.0|I hate PG movies now but this is actually funny movie that Adults will not want to miss. Such quality written jokes and the characters are easily lovable... all of them even the people with small roles. Now sex...just the occasional and natural high school boy/girl kiss.
1439107955|5.0|Who would have thought that a book about cancer would be hard to put down.  Not me, that's for sure.  And yet, time after time I struggled to put the book aside when my reading time was up, and was consistently eager to return.  And I don't like depressing books.  How can this be so?  This book is not so much a biography of cancer as a history of the battles against cancer, and as such, a history of science and medicine.  We learn about the progress of medicine over the centuries, we learn about the rise of radical surgery, of devastating chemotherapy, of the politics of cancer, of the cultural history from the Jimmy Fund, to \\"if we can put a man on the moon, we can cure cancer,\\" to Lance Armstrong.  And we learn about the different worlds of searches of causes of cancer (viral (people were afraid of catching cancer), genetic, environmental), of cures (and some cures caused cancer) and for understanding the biology of cancer --- parallel universes that often failed to intersect when they should have.      And all this is conveyed in clear but not condescending terms that were easily accessible but highly educational to this medical layperson.  Mukherjee can really write, and the book does a wonderful job of following particular topics (only some mentioned above) through periods of decades, so while moving chronologically forward in general, we bounce back and forth in time as we move from subject to subject.  Its almost like a series of wonderful New Yorker articles stitched seamlessly together.  And finally, Mukherjee mixes in just the right amount of personal stories to keep the science understandable and relevant.  The Pulitzer was well-deserved.  This is the best nonfiction book I've read this year so far.  Oh, and I can't imagine anyone who has read this book ever smoking a cigarette again.  Ever.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|I was very happy with my purchase. It was exactly like the description said it was and I'm very happy with the seller's honesty.
B00475AYJQ|1.0|I don't know why everyone is loving on this book. I enjoyed Name of the Wind and looked forward to this book. Honestly, this book goes on and on and on with very little moving on in the plot except for Kvothe talking and pontificating constantly. This book's story could have been done in 100 pages and not been so tedious. I kept waiting for the book to pick up--just hoping that the story might get exciting. What a waste of my time. Ended like a complete dud.
B00005JLIU|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie and so did my husband. Millie (Julie Andrews) is a modern woman of the 1920's and has set her sites on a job and getting married, preferably to her boss. But, fate is to take a drastic turn when her boss falls for her best friend (Mary Tyler Moore).  The house where they are living has it's own secrets, as their house mother is actually working for a group of Chinese individuals who kidnap pretty young girls and turn them into sex slaves. Before you freak out, it is all funny and clean.  It was such a fresh change.

1857885082|5.0|A very thought provoking and insightful book. As an English person reading it, it draws to your attention all the intricacies of class distinction and underlying humour that pervades almost everything we do. These are things that we are so used to that we do not seem to see untill they are pointed out to us. For anyone who was not brought up in England I can imagine this book would be equally as informative and as interesting a read.

0316056863|5.0|I was waiting for my husband at Publix and wanted something to read and I like Tina Fey so I picked this up. I was sitting on the bench at the pharmacy reading it and I swear I was driving the old lady crazy because I was laughing so hard I was shaking the bench. It's not even the fact that it's well written and legitimately humorous, it's also the very personally identifiable nature of the material. The whole beginning reads like an Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret\\" for the comedy circuit. I can only account for the first 100 pages but they sold me. I'll be going back to buy it the next time I get paid.

B0044XV3QY|5.0|Avatar (Three-Disc Extended Collector's Edition Blu-Ray)  I am so glad that I purchased Avatar CE Blu-Ray. LOTS AND LOTS of extras. The opening earth scene should have been left in the original and shown in theaters! When the \\"basic\\" avatar was being released first. Also FOX stated that there is going to be a CE version months down the road. A simple Google search would have told you that if you where interested in getting Avatar.  Also I have to LOL at the people complaining about switching DVD's when watching the extended version. It only takes 5 seconds and a good reason to get off your couch and stretch (or grab a snack!)  Well worth the purchase! Can't wait to see the next Avatar!!

B002ZG99TA|5.0|I purchased 3 of these DVD's, but not all from the same vendor. I don't know if there was an issue with the DVD company that made the DVD or not, but I have had certain issues with the actual DVD that is not the vendors' problem. My friend, who received the 3rd as a gift, loved it and has had no problems. It's a TERRIFIC movie, especially for train lovers and people that do the right thing, because it's the right thing to do!! ROCK ON!!
B001FB4W0C|3.0|Dont get me wrong I loved season 4 of Supernatural however, its not the quality of the show that I give the the low rating for. I give a low rating based soley upon the packaging. Somehow dont ask me how but every disk for Season 4 had its very own case. I found that to be number one just flat out weird number two just inconvient. Listen I liked season 4 with Dean returning from Hell the Dvd quality was good I got it shipped to me very quickly it just getting seperate cases for each disk that was annoying to me.

B0042816YK|5.0|\\"Wild Horses in Mongolia\\"? you ask. The point is that like her Mongolia documentary Julia in \\"Eat ...\\" shows her intelligence and courage in tackling domains and subjects that most of us would rather avoid. Yes, it was a bit too artificial and polished. Very much a producer's dream immense film production. It might have been better served to have Julia more naturally explore the topics discussed in the book. By analogy comparable to a college student's worldly exploration and discovery after dropping out of school for a year as opposed to the film's Costco travel agency programmed life experience tour which this movie resembled.     My only other criticism is that I would have liked to have seen her add the following important women's rights issue of self determination to the story with a trip to, let's say,  Afghanistan to showcase the life limiting abuse that women face there.
B0047Y17P2|2.0|I've read many of Michael Connelly's books and find them entertaining for the most part.  I was looking forward to this book after reading The Lincoln Lawyer.  I was satisfied with the writing up until the very end.  It appeared that Mr. Connelly either had a deadline to meet or he got to the end and just didn't know what to do.  Regardless of the reason why, the ending of this book is a disgrace.  The whole thing comes together in a few pages and much of the supposition by Mickey Haller doesn't ring true.  Not up to his usually good standards.
B00466HN6I|4.0|On the surface, the trailers for Source Code give you the impression of an action film dealing with themes that have been done before in other sci-fi - and fantasy - films and shows like Groundhog Day, Quantum Leap, Frequency, The Matrix and others. And while Source Code does involve ideas that have already been done, it does it in ways that raise it head and shoulders above most films in the genre, mainly in the way its characters react to the situation they find themselves in, and in the extremely fine performances given by Jake Gyllenhaal, Michelle Monaghan, Vera Farmiga, Jeffrey Wright and a host of others. You believe in their characters, and because of that, you believe the situation they're in and you come to care about them.<br /><br />I have to be careful not to give anything away because a lot of Source Code comes in a series of revelations, so I'll limit the set-up to what you can see in the trailers. The film begins with a man named Colter Stevens (Gyllenhaal) suddenly waking up on a train, not seeming to know where he is. His confusion only increases when he finds a woman sitting across from him, Christina (Monaghan), thinks he is someone else, a friend of hers named Sean Fentress. Disoriented, Stevens makes his way to the bathroom, only to find his reflection in the mirror is that of Fentress, whose ID he finds in his wallet. His immediate confusion comes to an abrupt end moments later when the train is ripped apart by a bomb, killing him and everyone on board.<br /><br />Or so it would seem, until he wakes up again, this time in some kind of military-esque environment pod, where we learn that Stevens is an Army helicopter pilot and his last memory, prior to waking up on the train, was being shot down while on a mission in Afghanistan. On a computer screen in the pod, a female Air Force officer, Captain Goodwin (Farmiga), begins talking Stevens out of his confusion. Stevens learns that he's part of a program called Beleagured Castle, and that he's being used to try and stop a terrorist who, having blown up the train, is planning on detonating a 'dirty' nuclear device in downtown Chicago in a matter of hours.  The scientist behind Beleagured Castle, Dr. Rutledge (Wright), has devised a technique involving quantum physics which allows them to create a \\"source code\\" version of the train bombing and to insert Stevens into the body of Fentress, a passenger on the doomed train, eight minutes before the bomb goes off. And they have to keep inserting Stevens back in again and again with the mission of finding the bomb and, more importantly, finding out the identity of the bomber behind it, before the threatened detonation of the nuclear device is carried out.<br /><br />A love interest unsurprisingly develops between Stevens and Christina, but it's handled in a way that you can actually believe it. But for me, the most moving parts of the film are the interactions between Stevens and his military handler, Goodwin. Gyllenhaal and Farmiga give outstanding performances as a soldier trying desperately to understand what is happening to him and the sympathetic officer who is in the difficult position of keeping him focused on the mission while knowingly withholding information from him that could jeapordize his ability to complete it.<br /><br />A lot of talent went into Source Code and it shows.  The director, Duncan Jones (this is his second film after the highly regarded Moon) gets the pacing just right, instinctively knowing when to speed things up, when to slow them down, and how to let things unfold, always keeping you engaged with the characters.  The writer, Ben Ripley, makes his first real mark here in giving Source Code's characters a level of human depth and believability that most films of the genre lack. Ripley gives the sci-fi aspects their due, but knows that the heart of any film is in the characters and in how the audience connects with them. And the evocative musical score by Chris Bacon is deftly done, adding to the mood of a scene while never overwhelming or distracting from what's happening.<br /><br />Note: a nice nod in the film to the TV show Quantum Leap was the choice of Scott Bakula, who played Sam Beckett, as the voice of Stevens' father.<br /><br />Overall, well done, highly enjoyable, and highly, highly recommended.never overwhelming or distracting from what's happening.

B004Q1FDHO|5.0|absolutely love this game. not to complicated. addicting. great graphics. love the theme. would have paid for it. more, more more.
8862933177|5.0|I didn't know this would be so fun to use! I want to watch more movies just to make more entries!
0525423273|5.0|It's very, very rare that a book can make me cry hysterically while at the same time making me feel like a million bucks! This novel is beautiful, amazing, real, funny, and wonderful. The list of adjectives describing the awesomeness of this book can go on forever! It's that great! Honestly, the only problem with this book is that it ended! I love this book so much I even went up to some random girl at the bookstore last night and told her to she has to read it because it's the greatest book ever!    Anna and the French Kiss is about Anna, whose father forces her to go to an American boarding school in Paris because he thinks it will be an amazing learning experience for her. Anna is reluctant because she doesn't want to leave her friends and little brother back home. On her first night alone in Paris, she meets her neighbor, Meredith, who introduces Anna to all of her friends, including the gorgeous, Étienne St. Clair, who everyone calls St. Clair. St. Clair is every girl's fantasy-beautiful, sweet, smart and bi-lingual (he knows French and English). He's also American, born in San Francisco, but raised in London, so he's got that cute English accent that's just swoon-worthy. St. Clair is a great guy and it really shows.    St. Clair has this horrible father that I just wanted to kill. His father bullies and controls his mom and him, and when his mother is dying of cancer-his jerk of a father won't even let him visit her. It was very stressful and I was crying for St Clair.    All of the characters were well developed. Even thought the narrative was Anna, I had a good connection with all the supporting characters. St. Clair especially because as mature as he is, he is still afraid of his father and the things he could do to his mom and him and he had to learn to stand up for himself.    Anna and St. Clair have this wonderful connection and I loved watching them go from strangers to best friends. St. Clair had a girlfriend, which kept messing things up, and Anna had this sort-of, but not really boyfriend back home but I wasn't going to give up on the two of them falling in love. Anna and the French Kiss is a beautifully written love story and Stephanie Perkins delivered! I was also pleased that it wasn't a \\"love at first sight\\" story, it was a love that happened gradually, which is more realistic and hard to find in today's YA books. This book is the ultimate love story, but it's also so much more. It's about growing up and finding yourself.    If I could give this book 100 stars, I would. I would recommend this book to everyone I know, and as I said earlier, even random people at the bookstore!
B002BU0DPE|4.0|I bought the PX21 so i can feel more the experience of the game, and i have to say that the PX21 did their job.  I bought the PX21 in 2010, and i still have them but on the left side, sometimes it doesnt work. The mic works perfect, and what i love about this product is that  you can turn off the voice chat, so if there are some noobs being anoying, i just turn off the voice chat. I dont regret buying the PX21 at all, i do have to say that the plastic that hold the earphones, did brake on mine but is just because i step on them. I did however fix it with crazy glue and it looks like new.
B003M5AXN4|5.0|I was completely blown away by the plethora of colors, the crisp video transfers, and the rush of each individual racing scene!!!

0316067598|1.0|I listened to this in audio book form (audible.com) and found the story fascinating and informative.  I was rather shocked, however, when he started blaming liberals and his worries about being found guilty of murder when they had to decide whether or not to kill an unarmed civilian.    I find that Rogue Warrior gives the right SEAL perspective without trying to blame others for mission failures.
1892005034|5.0|Reading this book by Mother's Day (today 5/8/11) is the best gift I could have given myself...the title does not do it justice...I only read it after 2 people urged me to do so (one being an MD). I have built an \\"Inc 500 Fastest Growing Privately Held Co\\" and a \\"Best Place to Work in Texas\\" company, but not until today do I feel that I know how to create a life filled with joy, hopefully modeling that possibility for my daughter who is only 2. Thank you, Marshall Rosenberg, for giving me the hope and encouragement I had lost until I read your book, especially when it comes to developing intimate lasting relationships.

B0002J4ZWS|5.0|A modern classic which should not be missed and is a 'must have' for any video collection. The acting is 'off the charts' and one particular scene in which Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are alone in the prison yard; one man apparently resigned to fate and the other overcome with thoughts of injustice....is just chilling to watch and should be considered a yardstick other performances are compared to.
B004G6009U|5.0|We saw this movie in the theater with our kids, ages 6 and 9. Each of us enjoyed the film in our own way. I was taken by the winning humor and gorgeous animation, my wife by the musical numbers, and the kids with everything. It has charm, wit, and for sensitive kids, it doesn't really have anything too frightening in it. We thoroughly enjoyed the experience.<br />Glad to say, the product transfers well to the home. For routine enjoyment the kids watch the DVD, but on occasion, we hunker down in the man-cave where the HDTV is and enjoy the Blu-ray. I guess that's why they do these dual packages...<br />Color and sound are impeccable on both transfers.
0553381695|3.0|While Game of Thrones was easily one of the best written fantasy novels I have read with brilliant plot structure, amazingly developed characters and tip top prose, unfortunately Clash of Kings fails to hold up on its own.  All GRRM does is lengthen his story by adding several hundred pages of plot and description that does nothing to solve or even to address the issues from Game of Thrones.  Characters disappear, story lines fade into nothing and for no more than to spur along the story to the next installment.  I mean if I have to read about ANOTHER standard or the description of arms, armor and banners or one more word about how to best season capons or the taste of gooseberries and cream I might never read GRRM again.      Don't get me wrong the writing is excellent, he knows how to spin a yarn and keep you interested, for a while.  The villains go from frustrating to just annoying every time they make horrible choice after horrible choice, only to be saved by one of GRRM literary miracles riding over the hill to save the day.  Its tiresome.  Once is exciting, twice is a trend, three times I just want to put my head through a wall.  And I wish we could say he only does this thrice, but its his \\"go to\\" move when he wants to end story lines quickly to get ready for a sequel.  For someone who expressly wants the reader to realize that their are truly no fairy tales, GRRM seems to rely on them to move his story along another 1000 pages.    Tolkien did not need to lead his readers by the nose to foster drama, he let the story speak for itself and what GRRM does with 1000 pages, Shakespeare would do in a single act still keeping all the tension, emotions, drama and joy of the plot intact.  GRRM is a great writer, that is not at question, but I would caution those who read Game of Thrones and expect more of the same: be prepared to read all of the books, because questions developed within the first 100 pages of Game of Thrones will not be answered for pages and pages latter or not at all.  So if you want a good story with great characters and you have the time and patience, read the series.  IF not, there are plenty of better, shorter stories available, Lord of the Rings, Once and Future King and the Shannara Series by Brooks.    The Best I can say about Clash of Kings is that its a bridge to the rest of the series.  You will get frustrated by the introduction of many new characters and the lack of conclusions from the old, that I can guarantee.
B003VANOFY|5.0|This is a REALLY nice set of headphones. I liked them so much I bought a pair for a friend at graduation (through Amazon of course). For the price, they are the best set I've seen so far. Comfortable to wear and work great for gaming or just puttin' around the house.
B001R4MEYI|5.0|So dig it...I'm a lifelong progressive metal fan, as well as a longtime stoner metal fan.So you may find it surprising that i was never impressed with Mastodon.Not to say they weren't interesting,just saying so what?!But with Cack the Skye,my opinion has changed dramatically..I literally CAN'T STOP JAMMING THIS ALBUM..It's just that damn good.I hear so many different bands mixed in there (including my own former band who mixed Pink Floyd with Neurosis & Metallica fairly well) Yet this sounds like no one else out there.I won't go into a track by track breakdown, as the album works better as a whole..The flow is amazing, much better than all the previous Mastodon catalog combined.Do yourself a favor & get the version that comes with the instrumental score version as well..this album is so good the lyrics & vocals aren't necessary to enjoy the disc.However Brent Hinds steals the show with his twisted southern Ozzy style vocals & phenomenal leads & solos. (like the out of tune banjo on 'Divinations',SWEET)Just buy it.I wouldn't lie to you, Would I?
B000BKHL1K|5.0|This thing is really a great idea, and as others have said, is practically an art piece.  Well made with a clever mounting design.  I mounted to a stud and would not recommend doing otherwise.    You do have to create the mounting holes exactly, so this is not something you can just slap up on the wall!
B000268QB2|5.0|I purchased this album from Amazon way back in 2004.  Even to this day it's my favorite Keane album.  Night Train and Perfect Symmetry....ehhh, I can hardly tell it's the same band.  They don't do anything for me.  But Hopes & Fears and also Under the Iron Sea are superb albums from my favorite Brit group.  I can only hope Keane gets back to their roots one day.
B0034G4P80|3.0|I'm not much of a Thor fan either, but this was anything but awesome. Sure it had its good moments here and there, but it did not come across as a THOR movie. His total look, although mildly impressive was incorrect. No helmet, facial hair, hair not long and blonde enough. And no Donald Blake. How can you have a Thor movie with out Donald Blake? Even though the costume was WAAAAAYYY wrong in The Incredible Hulk Returns, Eric Kramer was a much better Thor than this guy. If you have already seen this and enjoyed it I won't dispute your opinion, but if you are like me with a basic knowledge of the Thor character and his comic book and/or cartoon mythology this one may just disappoint.

This book kept me partially sane while also helping me understand the fundamentals of Java.  There was a lot of goofy stuff in this book, but for the most part it did its job well.

B002M2T1UO|4.0|The shield is an incredible series. This box set is a great item for a true fan. Delivered very quickly. However the shipping packaging needs improvement. It was delivered in a old cardboard box, with two small sheets of bubble wrap around the box set. This did not prevent the box set from moving around inside the cardboard box. My brand new box set now has damaged corners. Other than the substandardpackaging, I am very pleased. I give the box set itself 5 stars.
B001CVMD4M|5.0|I think this is one of the most perfect concerts i've ever seen. Since I watch it on TV on 2000 I fell in love with this show. Now it's restaured with new image and sound. The picture and sound quality is the best for sure (not like the istanbul one...)
B002VECMAE|3.0|So just who are these men who stare at goats?  They're members of an elite, covert military unit - known officially as the New Earth Army and unofficially as Jedi warriors - trained to use New Age mysticism and psychic powers to defeat the enemy (their staring at the goats is supposed to result in the animals' deaths). Bob Wilton is a newspaper reporter from Ann Arbor, Michigan who becomes personally involved with the unit while serving as a war correspondent in Iraq.  He's drawn in by a retired Special Forces operator by the name of Lyn Cassady who lets Wilton in on some of his most closely guarded secrets.<br /><br />Based on the book by Jon Ralston, \\"The Men Who Stare at Goats\\" claims to be based on fact.<br /><br />As that rare dark satire that takes on militarism and war as targets, Grant Heslov's \\"The Men Who Stare at Goats\\" gets more points for guts and daring than it does for execution.  Its points often lack clarity and focus and the hijinks occasionally feel too much like leftovers from \\"MASH\\" and \\"Catch-22\\" for total comfort.  Yet, there are enough offbeat and humorous moments to more than compensate for the frequent concept that backfires or the occasional joke that falls flat.  The basic premise of the story seems to be that since war is the province of madmen and fools, who better fit to wage it?  And in the topsy-turvy world of Peter Straughan's screenplay, even the counterculture concept of hippy-dippy pacifism gets co-opted by the military machine.<br /><br />The acting throughout is first-rate.  George Clooney is so entertaining as the half-brilliant/half-mad Cassady that he makes the movie worth seeing for his performance alone.  Add to that a host of fine performances by Ewan McGregor, Jeff Bridges and Kevin Spacey and you have a flawed but occasionally compelling work.
B001PPGAIA|4.0|I just recently did my first submission of a review and when I came to buy a DVD copy of Australia (I already have the BluRay) I decided to look at some of the reviews and was inspired to write my own.<br /><br />It's too bad some people didn't 'get' this movie. It's really a throwback & and homage to old time epics like Gone With The Wind, How The West Was Won and the original From Here To Eternity to name a few. There are 3 simultaneous stories going on so that apparently throws people who are used to a quick, blow stuff up and get on with it typical modern movie.<br /><br />There is the 1. love story of the 2 main character as they meet, get to know each other and help each other transform into a better version of themselves while trying to save her ranch, falling in love and being caught up in the other 2 parts of the story over the course of about 4 years. Next, 2. is the back story of the horrendous treatment of the aboriginals and the story of what came to be known as the &#34;lost gererations&#34; where children were taken from their families and raised to be white servants. Then there is 3. the story of Australia's surprising entry into WWII. So when I see people complain that it seems to have too many 'endings', what they don't seem to understand it that there has to be resolution to all three of the story lines. Although the 'lost generations' didn't really get resolved in total until many, many years later, the story of the one boy was resolved, the love story did the usual resolution...boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back and they both become better people. And, of course the war story goes from early rumblings and local war talk in the newspapers, rallying the people in support of Great Britain and on to the surprise that most people didn't even know about so I won't spoil it here.<br /><br />Anyway I feel sorry for people who  don't appreciate the epic aspects of this film. Is it perfect? No! The editing definitely could have been better and there are some continuity issues. My biggest issue, and the reason for less than 5 stars, was the way it was edited, especially the ending.. This doesn't take away from the story, acting or cinematography so wasn't bad enough to spoil my love of the movie. Most of the other negative comments by other people just don't fly for me. I thought the cinematography was spectacular, the music was beautiful & appropriate. The costumes were very good and very much fitting to the period & the people and the story was well done. Over all it has become one of my favorite films.issues. My biggest issue, and the reason for less than 5 stars, was the way it was edited, especially the ending..

I also  enjoyed all of the songs and I sing along with them. Alfie Boe plays a excellent part of Jean Valjean. Nick Jonas also plays an excellent part of Marius. I am a huge fan of Nick Jonas and his brothers. All of the main characters also play an  excellent part in the concert.
B001BNFR6W|1.0|I had ordered the complete series of Will & Grace on DVD. Every dvd was scratched so badly, I could not watch anything past first 20 minutes. Once I had discovered it was every dvd,I contacted the company to see about an exchange or refund, which they agreed to. Unfortunately a family emergency occured that had me leave town for a few weeks and I ended up passing the return date. I explained my situation after I was able to return home, and went to proceed with the exhange but then was told it was too late and they would not honor their word of allowing me to exchange or have a refund.<br />I was SOL, and just threw a few hundred dollars out of the window.<br /><br />This is the absolute worst experience ever.

0865479186|3.0|As a scientist, I have three things to say about Ben Goldacre's book *Bad Science*:    1.  He makes excellent points.  The reader, consumer, patient, doctor must pay very close attention to the details of a study before accepting any conclusions.  Fallacies are plentiful and often subtle, and he does a good job at exposing many of them.  2.  The book is poorly written.  There are better ways to present this material to a general audience.  The average reader will get the gist, but will find it difficult to follow the arguments.  3.  He does not mention a critical point:  One can poke holes in any study, because no study can possibly prove causation.  It is logically impossible to prove that two events are cause and effect.  A well-conducted study can only establish apparent correlation and even high plausibility, but not causation.  In plain language, you can never establish with certainty that a given pill will make people feel better, even on average.  But a good study will tell you whether or not a suspected cause is plausible.
B003XCVQ3C|1.0|Ordered this from J&R via Amazon. Couldn't get it to work with my brand new April 2011 MBP 15\\" and Vizio HDTV.  I tried everything, two different HDMI Cables, \\"Detect Displays\\", even turned off automatic graphics switching (under power options).  My MacBook recognized the TV, listed it under displays, but for some reason the adapter was not sending a signal.  I looked at some reviews of this product on the apple store site, and many customers complained of bad quality or their cables working for a month or two then quitting.  I think that I received a \\"bad\\" product, but instead of trying to exchange I am going to go with the cheaper Griffin product direct through Amazon.

B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I really, truly loved this book.  I didn't want it to end.  I kept watching the Kindle's % tick the pages down, and I almost slowed down toward the end to draw out the experience of reading.      Sure there were a few pages here and there that didn't resonate with me, or which felt a little forced.  But that teeny tiny percentage of the book was so far outweighed by the total awesomeness of the remaining 99.9% of the story, I forgot those moments by two sentences into the next part of the book.      Fey is utterly relateable, quirky and cool.  She struggles with the same things we all do: balancing motherhood and ambition; being a woman in a male-dominated world; and trying to come to grips with who she is as an individul in the midst of all that chaos.      Fey rocks.  So does this book.  I laughed with her and I cried with her.  And I can't ask for more than that for $13.
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|I have to state that I didn't really understand why there was another adaptation of P&P done so soon after the magnificant A&E/BBC series with Firth and Ehle. I have so much loved that version that I watched this determined not to like it. I didn't hate it but compared to Firth and Ehle (and the entire cast of that version) I just couldn't reach the same appreciation for the newer version. It probably isn't fair to compare the cast of this one to the other, however I do. Charlotte Lucas looks like she is 12 instead of 27. Col Fitzwilliam is a pudgy military officer. Georgiana Darcy is played by the same girl who was Henry VIII's 5th wife and plays her as a valley girl just like she did in The Tudors instead of the shy girl portrayed in the book and in the BBC version. Mr. and Mrs. Gardner were also portrayed as rather shabby people even though they were affluent enough through his business to have a London house, carriages etc. Their children don't exist in this version - in fact, Mrs. Bennet proclaims they have no children - even though we know that they did. Even though a two hour movie can't support the same number of characters as the 5 hour version, the omissions are really egregious.<br /><br />I did feel that probably this version was more historically accurate with the depiction of the Bennet house and the village...much more drab and rustic. Piles of manure on the roads and paths, sloppier animal pens etc. But it did not make for more pleasurable viewing. While the Bennet's were not of the same wealth as Darcy or Bingley, they did not reside in the hovel surrounded by pig stys shown in this version. The family all dressed very dis-shelved and drab. Mrs. Bennet would never  allow her daughters to roam around barefoot and sloppy. If anything, she was always trying to behave and live in a higher class manner than their income supported. The house is dark and shabby even though it is an estate.<br /><br />Perhaps if I'd never seen the A&E/BBC version, I might have appreciated this one more, however I don't think I would have the same appreciation for the story. I don't think Jane Austin would be proud.

0385484518|5.0|I read this book as a school project not really expecting to enjoy it. I was wrong. Tuesdays with Morrie is an amazing story for anyone who has every questioned the meaning of life, or needs to hear something uplifting. Morrie says,\\"Devote yourself to loving others, devote yourself to your community around you, and devote yourself to creating something that gives you purpose and meaning.\\" which should give anyone the drive to go out and do what they love, not what will get them the most success. The lessons in this novel really spoke to me because I will be going to college in a year, and I do not really know what to do. Morrie's lessons of doing what you love and devoting life to doing something with a purpose will serve as a guiding light as I get my life started in college. I personally recommend this book to everyone.
B0041KKYDI|5.0|I read the book first and knew the detail of the real Aron's entrapment.  The film does justice to the real situation, his flashbacks, and visions of a possible child in his future.  While the cave drop and swim is interesting, it doesn't really contribute to the real story.  Aron's escape and hike for his own rescue is amazing, and the movie shows the hardships still involved in his rescue.
1416972242|4.0|I liked the first book and the second one is a good middle book for a trilogy.  I moved through this one a bit slower...skimmed some and skipped a bit, but overall a good read.  Its a book that I would recommend for a mature high school reader for for adults. Language is fine, but the themes on incest and homosexuality may be offensive for some readers.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|takes strengths from the first book and makes them stronger.  Characters remain but soon find they need to learn on their feet outsie the Univercity walls.  cant wait for the third part to come out.
1416972250|4.0|The third book wrapped up the story nicely, although now I learn there are additional books, so I guess it really isn't \\"the end.\\"  You do have to pay more attention in this book with all the new characters (keeping up with family connections).  The book is still a bit tricky with the incest themes and homosexuality, so I would suggest it for high school or older readers.
B002ZG976U|5.0|The movie was excellent and I just had to have the DVD. It is wonderful to see Cher singing again. She is awesome, so is Christina. Great price and fast delivery!

0307593495|4.0|We come to know the man, Wallander, as an intimate friend. Mankell saved the best for last.[[ASIN:0307593495 The Troubled Man]]
0670022411|3.0|I liked the setup of this book, it is something \\"slightly different\\" than the usual fare offered in this genre.  The flow of the book is a little \\"rough\\" it is very slow-going in the beginning and you don't really find out a lot of what is going on until the second half of the book.  The \\"chemistry\\" between the two main characters seemed a little forced but the second half of the book is much better.  I liked this enough to want to read the next one in the series but I'm glad I got it from the library.
B0034G4P80|4.0|Background<br /><br />Firstly it should be noted that Thursday is derived from an Old English word, which effectively meant: \\"Thunor's Day\\". This in turn was influenced from another Old Norse word which effectively has the meaning \\"Thor's Day\\". In Germanic paganism, Thor is a hammer-wielding god associated with thunder, lightning, storms, oak trees, strength, destruction, fertility, healing, and the protection of mankind.<br /><br />In the early 1960s Marvel Comics introduced Thor into their line up of fictional superheroes. The Norse mythology character made appearances in several publications, and he became a member of the superhero team the Avengers. It is based on this comic book character that this film was produced. Next year, this character will also be featured in film called the Avengers.<br /><br />The Actors<br /><br />Veteran actor Anthony Hopkins takes up the role as Odin. This was an excellent choice. His role was somewhat similar to his role in Beowulf. Natalie Portman (Best Actress Oscar winner 2010) plays Jane Foster, Thor's eventual earth bound sweetheart. The rest of the cast including Thor (Chris Hemsworth) are not as well known, however, their performances are quite acceptable.<br /><br />Storyline<br /><br />Odin has a secret, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) is not really his son. His real roots end up making him a pretty nasty bad guy, which he portrays quite well. The action unfolds on Earth, Asgard and on another world where there was an ancient war. The sets are very well designed (and loaded with tons of computer graphics, especially Asgard). Thor develops and matures during this story. It is really a very extensive case of sibling rivalry.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />This film is quite enjoyable, but you get the feeling that something was missing. This maybe because a lot of time was spent trying to establish the whole concept of realm of Asgard. However, it makes a good launch pad for next year's Avengers Movie. There is a lot of drama elements included, but this seems to have taken the edge off of the action sequences.e action sequences.
0307593495|2.0|Mankell's usual insightful characterization can't carry a plot that seemed to substitute travel over logic.  Many train and plane and car trips...and at the end, what?! *** spoiler alert *** I thought back to (for example) the book hidden in Signe's room.  In light of who the villain was, what was the purpose of the book? And the whole find-the-hidden-submarine thing - what was that for? What about the cylinder? And in light of the identity of the villain, did the murder of the wife make sense?  Hardly. I agree with an earlier critic - listing the unanswered questions wasn't sufficient.  Having said all that, I remain a huge Wallander fan.  Mankell spawned many imitators, but his was the first and the best of the cold-climate-disaffected-investigators.  If he's gone for good, I'll miss him.  (And may I say, I always liked his surly artist father as well.)
076790382X|1.0|When I buy a chocolate cake, I expect it to be chocolate inside and out unless the label says otherwise. This book was chocolate on the outside and marble or plain white once opened. As a person who has re-entered the U.S. on 4 different occasions after living overseas in various places for extended periods of time, I felt really cheated. The author writes of some of the culture shock he encounters, but spends much of the time rambling on about things that have no relevance to the title. I did not expect biology lessons on why leaves change color in the fall, skunks (are there none in England?), his childhood memories of Iowa, etc. I could barely get through the last, very long chapter on English architects, architecture, and furniture makers. If I'd wanted to read up on those subjects I would purchased appropriate books. This book was a waste of my time -- and money!
B00006JKOM|4.0|\\"Too Old to Rock and Roll...\\" is an uneven album, it's a case of where the album is just o.k., but there are some amazing songs on there.  As a whole, the album isn't one of Tull's best, but it has some of their best songs on it.  \\"From a Deadbeat to an Old Greaser,\\" the title track, \\"Pied Piper,\\" and \\"The Chequered Flag\\" are some of Tull's best, if lesser known songs (well, obviously with the exception of the title track...).  \\"Quiz Kid,\\" Salamander,\\" \\"Crazed Institution\\" and \\"Big Dipper\\" are good, and the are pretty catchy songs.  \\"Bad Eyed and Loveless\\" and \\"Taxi Grab\\" are both songs I never really cared for.      If you're a Tull fan and don't know whether to get it, get it.  If you're new to Tull, wait before getting it - it's not the album to start with.

B000002KOQ|5.0|Some years ago a friend (Gen-x) asked me to tell her about the 60s.  I talked about civil rights, equal rights, Vietnam, and then said, for a lot of us on the home front the 60s were about sex, drugs and rock'n'roll, but mostly about rock'n'roll, which of course was a pretty broad term.  She asked me to name an album, if I could, that summed up the spirit of the 60s.    When I was telling another friend a few days later about this conversation, she asked:  \\"So what did you tell her -- 'Blue' or 'Ladies of the Canyon'?\\"     Amazed, I said that I had told her \\"Ladies of the Canyon.\\"     I'm not telling this story to start a debate about which album I should have named, \\"The Doors,\\" \\"I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You,\\" \\"Highway 61 Revisited,\\" \\"Electric Ladyland,\\" or you pick.   I'm mostly saying that this album is about a lot more than the music, as beautiful and lyrical as it is.  It's about a feeling of love and passion and the fulfillment of living -- \\"Cats and babies 'round her feet, and all are fat and none are thin\\"  -- and therefore of course about not just the '60s at all but about the need for connection with other people regardless of the decade.  This really, in a small or large way, is what the whole album is about, or so it seems to me.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|Finding DVD-Audio discs of music/artists I like hasn't been easy.  I saw the reviews for this album and with the price being so good (vs some DVD-Audio discs going for $90) I jumped on it.  I only play my DVD-Audio discs in the car and this one sounds amazing.  I grew up listening to the Beatles and the mixes are a little different with some songs but very nicely done.  This should be a no brainer to add to your collection.  I bought it from  Amazon's Marketplace and the vendor had it to me in under 4 days.

B00127RAJY|4.0|This is a very challenging workout and Jillian is a great motivator to help you keep going and not stop when you are exhausted.  Each workout is very short (about 20 minutes) so you can get through the whole thing & it works out your entire body.  I love the way she does 3 minutes of strength, then 2 minutes cardio, then 1 minute abs x3 sets and the exercises vary.  They are very challenging moves.

0316098329|4.0|\\"We feel free when we escape even if it be from frying pan into the fire\\".(Hoffer)  Am I the only reader that did not interpret this fine novel in the literal sense?  Loosely based on a grotesque story this novel goes far beyond the idea of the being confined to Room. The mother/child dynamic and resultant impact of such confinement have been dealt with quite well in several reviews.  I wish to go beyond the obvious.  Is Room not a human condition?  Do we not all have the adult/child conflict of maturing while clinging to the security of the previously known?  I appreciate the authors use of religion as just such a conflict.  The authors development of the mother child bond goes without need of further explanation.  \\"Most men lead lives of quiet desperation and go with the song still in them\\"(Thoreau) defines Room as the human condition.  The transition to \\"world\\" is the liberation and escape from the desperation be it as mentioned earlier frying pan to fire.  The personal strength of this woman as manifested in the boy enabled a successful transition that would have left a weaker   being quite neurotic. For as Jung described \\"neurosis is the inability of man to tolerate ambiguity\\"---Ma and child did not demonstrate this inability. The book Room is a powerful treatise of the human condition, the creativity of the human to cope in needless to say adverse conditions and the human spirit to endure as a result of faith and love.
B00164GDA0|5.0|This is a classic that deserves a place in the all-time great movie listings.  Blu-ray just makes it better.

B0006HBZXS|2.0|The Edge is a fine film and deserves at least four stars; however, my two stars reflect the fact that the DVD is not enhanced for widescreen TVs, especially since it's presented in 2.35:1 aspect ratio. The Blu-ray, on the other hand, is excellent and, of course, is enhanced.
B001UV4XFQ|4.0|I watched the first movie after hearing form my daughters that it was good.  I knew it was probably designed for girl tweens but tried it anyway (at home).      I had never read the books so the movie held some surprises.  Vampires, ok.  (Well cast by the way.)  Before we know too much Edward saves Bella's life (I don't understand why this actress, decent in other movies, is so bland and why Edward AND Jacob fall for her).  Cool scene.  But the scene that was most fun was the baseball game.  It was well done and fun to watch \\"vampire\\" baseball.     The movie does tend to get bogged down (for me) when Bella thinks too much or when Bella/Edward talk too much (maybe tween girls find the talk romantic), I don't know.   Finally, there is some violent action near the end which helps.           I  do have more trouble with Jakob and the wolves.  Vampires ok, but now super large wolves, too.  I can't stand when Jakob pouts, storms off, or looks smug (say, when Bella gets on his motorcycle).   And his taking his shirt off all the time is quite annoying (I know some kids like this when I grew up.    As a guy, if you want to throw some sex in fine --- a little making out with actual T&A would be fine.  I could take Jakob having his shirt off during such a scene.  Of course, having a beautiful girl /woman play the part of Bella would have helped, too.  It would also make Edward's and Jakob's lust for Bella at least    somewhat believable.        (The third movie is strong on action --- a good thing; but the second movie is boring and has too much talk between Bella and Jakob.  I'd skip the 2nd movie.)

B00000JRTX|5.0|Hugh Grant is wonderfully charismatic and a master of self-deprecating humor. Being on a Hugh Grant kick lately I watched three of his films all in the same week. Love Actually, Sense & Sensibility, and 4 Weddings and a Funeral. Fun way to watch these movies because of the overlap in players and to understand classic British style: themes include tension between being proper and true to oneself, a wide cast of characters all intertwined, somehow, uncertainty of who will end up with who, extreme, offbeat secondary characters that are almost caricatures, and everything wrapped up neatly in the last 5-10 minutes of the film. This movie combines British and American themes, some as expected match ups and other surprises. Also rather British in that it is easier to describe who the movie is about as opposed to what the movie is about. Who it is about is an American woman and a British man who meet up at various mutual friends' weddings, seem meant for each other, but the timing for one, the other, or both always seems to be off. It is about missed opportunities and that oh so British theme of the struggle to be true to one's self in the face of opposing expectations. Four stars plus a bonus star for Hugh Grant.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|i dont follow these types of films, i simply have a young child and if hes watching tv, i want it to be something conscious and pure. i appreciate this movie because of just this. its a beautiful story. the only thing i dont like is the part when the mother calls ponyos father a 'freak show\\", and at times i think there might be some subliminal messaging about women being bad drivers...BUT, overall, i feel comfortable letting my child watch this movie, and i trust that it teaches him openness to magic, creativity, adventure and love.
0375703764|5.0|This book is a new adventure every time I crack it open.  There's something wonderfully bizarre about how Mark D. is able suck you into this storyline with his creation.  I still get hints of \\"Amityville Horror\\" on numerous occasions, but as it's more of a tingle than a full-on plagariam sensation, I enjoy it.  If you've never read this, it's definately one to try out during the summer or winter so that when you really get into it (during the frozen hallway) you won't have to worry about waking up early for work or school the next day.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|given the nature o' my other reviews this one may seem wildly out o' place; but the fact is, i LOVE to laugh.  now i never saw this series when it was on; in fact, i began a few years ago with season 4 at a garrison library.  simply put - i laughed my ass off.  long story short, with only seeing less than 1/2 o' the entire series i decided to risk the box set.  it's clear all the pieces were in place in season 1 - albeit in rough-sketch form; but by the end o' S3 there is no denying they had perfected the formula that would consistently carry the show from 'the one with the jellyfish' to 'the last one'<br /><br />would i know any o' these people in real life?  probably not (although i may have bumped into Phoebe at a Carcass show...), but what makes this series more than repeatable viewing is the high quality o' writing.  period.  ok, that and all the actor's commitment to ensuring that the writing was actually improved upon - no mean feat.  as komedies go there is not a bad episode to be found in the last 7 seasons - actually no real bad shows during the 1st few either; but it's clear that shortly into S3 some o' the characters stopped being parodies o' themselves and relaxed into actual human beings...at which point it became truly must-see.  not even the mighty 'seinfeld' can consistently match the riotous heights achieved here<br /><br />there's no telling how much longer this juggernaut could've kept going, but one thing is obvious, the show went out at the TOP o' its game - another rarity in this age o' milking dead horses.  do you enjoy laughing?  then invest in this series...for the money it is without a doubt the best health plan EVER offered by an amerikan corporation<br /><br />...joey's guest spot on 'the pyramid' (season 10) is one o' the funniest comedy sketches written in the english language; in fact, 'the one where the stripper cries' is a high point in the history o' comedy, period

Another commonality seems to be a randomness of billings, in this one Grant was given a top billing and a picture on the DVD cover, but was very much a secondary character. More talked about than actually shown. In his scenes he was so constrained/proper that it was almost painful to watch. Great acting and wonderfully unpredictable as far as who will end up with who.
B004KPLVW2|3.0|Standard BluRay upgrade but a little disappointed that no digital copy version released...I originally purchased the Collectors Edition only to find out the Original Tron included was only the bluray disc and no regular DVD nor any Digital copy....it was cheaper to just by the Legacy 4 disc set and the separate Original Tron (which though it didnt come with a digital copy it did come with a DVD disc also)
1579128149|5.0|Just discovered this title. I really like Gray's writing style. He made a book about the periodic table of elements a page turner. He doesn't go into a lot of detail, so probably not a good book for someone who needs those details, but for the rest of us, who just want to know more about what the universe is made of, I highly recommend this book.

B00260HH3K|1.0|I love Dragonball Z, always have and when I heard that they made a live action movie, I said to myself, \\"Oh, God, This movie is gonna suck\\".  That was the BIGGEST understatement of my life.  Is there ANY good points to this movie?  None what so ever.  Poorly chosen actors, they didn't even try to finds actors that would resemble the anime characters.  Let's pick a pretty girl, put a tiny streak of blue on her hair and call her Bulma.  Let's get a famous martial artist and call him Master Roshi (No white hair, no beard, not HALF the dirty old man).  I think the part of the movie that angered me the most is when they called Goku's signature move the Kame-hame-ha!  WTF?!  That is how he calls out the attack as he charges and fires it.  It is called the Kamehameha wave (like Hawaii's King Kamehameha).  All the people involved in writing, producing and creating this movie should be drug out into the middle of the street and shot.  OR at least banned from making movies ever, EVER again.  DO NOT get this movie, EVER!  If someone offers it to you for free, say \\"NO\\"!
0374158460|5.0|Reading this is like having a lengthy relationship with someone brilliant, funny, beautifully articulate, irreverent, engaging. Not for those with short attention spans who prefer to spend their free time on Facebook or at the Gap. But if you get hooked, and I certainly was, then it's a rush of a book.

Another commonality is the randomness of billing, clearly Grant was the star here but was billed fourth or fifth. This movie shows the many sides of love both the light hearted infatuation and in one scene with Emma Thompson how heart wrenching love can be. Many of the players (but not Hugh Grant) in this film were also in Nanny McPhee.
B001HDO4YW|3.0|This album is top notch, but I knew that before buying the record.  The one hindrance I've had to listening to it is that the record was a little dusty, which is no good for records.  Not that it can't be cleaned, I would just like to be able to play a record straight out of the shrink wrap with no issues.<br /><br />Got here in great time, however!
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This is more of a chick flick than a guy movie, but oh so good! This is a great story for a rainy Sunday afternoon. The acting was top-notch! It is now my very favorite romantic movie. It has drama, humor, history, and a whole lot of romance.

B004NDVJJG|5.0|I became acquainted with Marcin Wasilewski's trio through Tomasz Stanko's albums.  The music they recorded is easily some of the finest stuff released by ECM (or at all!).  Even though Stanko is a fantastic musician in his own right, I was incredibly excited when I saw that the trio was branching off to do their own thing.  Their pre-ECM records are very good, but the recording quality wasn't quite the same as on ECM efforts, understandably.  Their first ECM release, \\"Trio\\", took care of that and was a great record.  \\"January\\" was even better, continuing the line of musical thought established in the trio's previous releases and polishing it.  \\"Faithful\\" is their best record yet.<br /><br />If you enjoyed the Marcin Wasilewski Trio's previous efforts, pick this one up without any second thoughts.  If not, I recommend buying all of the ECM releases from the trio.  The music is sophisticated yet accessible, with plenty of interesting melodies, happenin' improv, and tasty harmonies.  I suppose you could knock these guys for \\"not evolving\\", but who cares when the music is good in the first place?  No other piano trio comes close to these guys, and I for one can't wait for their next release.
B0034G4P8A|4.0|Judging by the trailers, I thought Thor would be a complete mess. Then I began reading some very positive reviews and that was enough to get me to fork over the $11.00 to see it in IMAX 3-D.<br /><br />I wasn't amazed by it, but I didn't feel I wasted my money either. The story was okay, though somewhat laughable at times (I knew the source material would be hard to convert to a film without sounding cheesy), the acting was good and the CGI was adequate. Maybe it was the 3-D, but some of the visuals looked blurry or flat out cheaply done. I almost didn't see it in 3-D because it was done after the fact, but most critics had said that it was used properly for a change.<br /><br />There are a couple of mentions that link this character with the other heroes for the upcoming Avengers movie, which was sort of neat in Iron Man and Iron Man 2, but now it seems like just a ploy to hype up that future film. We get it.<br /><br />Thor is fun while it lasts but ultimately ranks somewhere in the middle of comic book adaptations. There is nothing to really hate about it, but there is also nothing memorable enough to warrant a sequel or repeat viewings.<br /><br />3 and 1/2 out of 5 stars

0810979772|4.0|I started with one but, had to buy more because, each of my children wanted one.  It's a simple but smart idea.   Like a journal framework with a little mad lib spirit thrown in.  Just in case you're old enough to know what I'm talking about.
6304711875|5.0|If you are into slasher movies this movie is for you! Scream is a original scary movie. It has so many plot twists and you don't find out the killer till the end. Wes Craven is a genius with this movie. The acting is great and there are many famous actors in it. Neve Cambell is just amazing at acting scared! Great movie of the 90's! Buy this movie!!!!!!!!!!!

B003VS0CX8|5.0|We watched the film through.  Then we watched it again with the Robert Wise commentary track. Then we watched it again with the Julie Andrews commentary track and then re watched selected parts yet again.  The film is beautiful.  The color balance is superb, the images clear and detailed.  The sound is fine with reasonable channel separation.  This is the definitive version of this great movie and an example of what Blu ray can, but often doesn't, do.

B0028DRGDQ|4.0|the movie was very good. however if you've seen Quarantine then the only reason to watch this version is to hear it done in Spanish.  I found very few differences between Rec and Quarantine.  you have a medical intern instead of a vet and an Asian family instead of an African family.  other than that same movie.    But I liked Quarantine therefore I liked Rec.
1433502410|5.0|This is my stay at home and study Bible because it is so big.  It is full of information, facts, pictures, references.  I love the ESV version.  I have a thinline I use for church because the size of this one made it difficult to carry with little children.  One of the best study Bible's I have had/used (comparison with 4 others).  If you like the ESV and looking for a excellent reference and study Bible this one is it.
0425241505|5.0|Wow! One of the top debuts this year. Dragon Bound is a mixture of all that Paranormal Readers love about J.R. Ward and Jacquelyn Frank. This novel kicks with all the excitement and steamy romance that readers love. This is a must have to any Paranormal Romance collection.
031261246X|5.0|I am often disappointed with Infosec novels, because most of the time their authors are either too technical (and difficult to read for a non professional) or written by authors not really involved in the cybersecurity field (making the story non-realistic). Some recent novels like \\"Fatal System Error\\" or \\"Kingpin\\" are fortunately much more enjoyable, and \\"Zero Day\\" by Mark Russinovitch is my favorite.    Working and living as a security professional involved in management (as CISO), operations (as specialist) and research (as teacher), I can say that the plot narrated in Zero Day is not only realistic, but also thrilling and really nice to read.     Some technical aspects of the attacks described are maybe difficult to achieve without important budget and knowledge (eg. aircraft attacks), nevertheless they are technically feasible and prefigure tomorrow's risk levels that security managers will have to deal with.    I'm now using some examples of the book in my IT security classes and also reference it for non-IT managers and businessmen that should care more about the cybersecurity issue, since the plot is quite realistic and also easy to follow. Mark is not a newcomer in the Infosec field, and that also helps to leverage the quality of the book.    Halfway through the book, the story was so captivating and full of suspense that I couldn't stop, and kept reading until the end !
0062060554|4.0|Imagine , if you can, waking up every morning in a strange room with a strange man who says he has been your husband for twenty years. You think you're 27 years old but the mirror tells you that you are 47.<br /><br />A brain injury has left Christine without the ability to form new memories. Each morning her loving husband shows her pictures and patiently describes their life together. When a strange doctor calls saying he can help her she starts meeting him secretly and keeping a journal. Each day he calls to tell her who he is and where she has hidden the journal. When her husband's daily stories, and what she thinks might be flashes of memories, differ from the journal she starts to question the validity of the journal. Or perhaps her husband is just bored with telling the same stories every day for twenty years?<br /><br />I finished the book in one day because I couldn't find a good \\"stopping place\\". Had to know what came next. I found the book very intriguing up until the last when everyone started to gather for the happy ending and explaining who knew what, when , why and how come.  It started to feel like a \\"the butler did it who-done-it\\".  Recommend the book however.

159420229X|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It does not claim to teach you memory techniques... and, well, it doesn't.  Since reading the book I've used the memory palace technique to remember directions (it was invaluable, here -- as this ability was not previously within my grasp) and a few other minor tasks.  The author does a fantastic job of explaining the evolutionary role of memory, of demonstrating the essence of \\"savants,\\" and of \\"whetting your appetite.\\"  If there's an obvious flaw in the book, it's that it doesn't point you to resources for you to being your own memory training.    This was to be a work of \\"participatory journalism.\\"  It succeeds at this.  I found it to be engaging and well-written.

B003YFIUW8|3.0|At first i wasn't sure at times it's hard to read because things are unclear because it's suppose to be written through the mind & words of a 5 year old child. At times i thought the mother was a hero for doing everything she could to protect her child, at other times i wanted to smack her for not being more understanding. It's okay as far as the story goes, but i wouldn't read it again & to be honest i think all the hype is just that.

0061928356|4.0|Jasu and Kavita Merchant lived in a small village of Dahanu in India. Kavita prayed that this time, she would give birth to a son. She can not bear to go through the pain of losing another child. Unfortunately, Kavita's prayers were unanswered and she gave birth to a little girl named, Usha. Knowing that Kavita's husband, Jasu would get rid of Usha, Kavita and her sister trek many miles to the nearest orphanage. Kavita never left her husband know what she did.<br /><br />All the way across the continent, in California, married couple Dr. Krishnan and Dr. Somar Whitman is hoping for a healthy child. Somar ends up having a miscarriage. She is devastated. Krishnan is from India. He suggests that they adopt a child from India. As you can imagine, Somar and Krishnan end up adopting Usha.<br /><br />I had seen this book in a mailing. It sounded intriguing and I immediately put this book on my wish list. I made the right choice. This book was spell binding. I could not stop reading it. The inter-relationships between Jasu, Kavita, Somar, Krishnan and Usha were nice. Though, I must admit that I found Jasu and Kavita's story to be more entertaining. At first, I did not think I would like Jasu but as the story progressed, I found that his devotion to Kavita was endearing and he won me over. I can not wait to see what author, Shilpi Somaya Gowda has in store for readers next. Secret Daughter is a book that is meant to be shared and would make the perfect selection at your next book group.
B004KPLVW2|4.0|This review is of the 2 disc Blu-ray/DVD combo of Tron: The Original Classic.  The movie itself seems quite dated by today's standards.  It's also clearly meant to be a family friendly film with fairly simplistic characters and an interesting, if somewhat dated and perhaps unimaginative plot.  Of course, that's also based on the concept that computers trying to take over the world and killing people, and people being trapped in computers (or simulations) seems over-done by today's standards.  Back when the film was created the ideas were fresh and new, and the film definitely had heavy influences on such films as Terminator (MCP vs Skynet), and The Matrix (people trapped in a computer \\"simulation\\").     If you like the Tron movie, this is an excellent collection. Although it's somewhat disappointing that it doesn't have a digital copy, the Blu-ray version does have a lot of extras that somewhat make up for this omission.  Also if you liked Tron Legacy and haven't seen this film, you owe it yourself to watch it.  There are quite a lot of \\"in-jokes\\" in Tron Legacy set up from this film, making Legacy as much an homage to the original as it is a sequel.
B004LB59VE|3.0|There are some beautifully written passages in this book. Paul Harding really does evoke a sense of 'being there' not just visually but emotionally. However it is incredibly long-winded at times. Some of the sentences of this book are the longest I have ever seen, running close to one whole entire page in some instances. I found that I was scanning pages more than reading them, because it was just taking way too long to get to the point. The excepts from a couple of sources included in the book too seemed over-done, not just a paragraph or two was included but several pages worth.     Saying that however if you are the type of reader who revels in beautifully written passages and like to smell the roses, admire the scenery within a book, then this is likely to be more your kind of book.  Personally I would have preferred Paul Harding to have been a little more succinct.

0553386794|5.0|I've never been a big reader of fantasy. I read the Hobbit in school, The Dark Elf Trilogy sometimes after that, and Lord of the Rings when the films came out. I am, however, an avid reader in general and was shocked when I was this great ad for a new HBO show based on a best selling series and had never heard of it.<br /><br />Elves, Dragons, Wizards, and Dwarves and all I decided to venture from my comfort zone and give it a shot. If this sounds like you so far read no further. Just read the book without a knowledge in the world about it. Then come back and see if you agree.<br /><br />If you've done that or are just looking for a general review, there is only one word for it. Epic. Not as in \\"I just teabaged the leader in Halo\\" epic, but as in The Odyssey epic. And it's not so much fantasy as altered history. The fantasy stuff is always somewhere lurking in the back, threatening your comfort zone but keeping a respectful distance. Then you start to become curious about it's ways as it slowly creeps in. Before you know it, you want less and less lords and ladies, and more and more demons and beasts.<br /><br />Now, you may have heard the series has morally grey characters, multiple plot lines, and shocking twists by now. You may thing between your Pulp Fictions and Sixth Senses and network television you may have gotten used to some of those things by now. But no, believe me you haven't.<br /><br />Characters aren't just grey, they're real....but in their own world. They reflect both larger ideas of behavior, mixed with unique and well sustained character traits, wrapped up in the unique attributes of their fictional world. They're real, but in their own ways. It also helps lend creedence to old re-used characters like the hardened veteran, the good knight, the noble hero, and the men turned to redemption by making them as interesting as they were when you first saw them in youth.<br /><br />And plot-lines aren't just multiple, they are interwoven and richly detailed featuring a host of interesting characters. The only thing better than when they all work together, is when they start to branch in their own unique directions. George R.R. Martin weaves a tapestry of the finest plot threads here, and leaves you dangling on every new verse and character. With every new chapter comes a new perspective and a new way to look a the world. It's a unique structure that is a little challenging at first, but pays off richly in the end. Plus hey, if Martin was going to create a detailed new landscape, why not explore all of it?<br /><br />Finally those twists. All I'll say is this. You haven't guessed them. Sure you're smart and too cool to be fooled, and you may have guessed a couple of them, but don't get cocky kid. You have no idea what's coming. Because it's not just great big twists, it's little developments along the way. The \\"shocking reveal\\" isn't just used for the endgame but rather keeps the story fresh and moving along through all of it's exciting escapades. My jaw literally dropped while reading this book, and I highly doubt I'm unique in that.<br /><br />Overall, not only is this a great book but it kicks off a fantastic series. That said though, I could see this one easily becoming most peoples favorite. Later works can get bogged down in details and side stories, therefore requiring a little slogging to get through. This first installment, however, is as tight as it is intricate. The pages fly by and you read on just to see what happens next to your favorite character (an ingenious by product of the design). Worth a read on ever conceivable mature reading level, Game of Thrones as a single book ranks among the best fantasy works ever produced and could go toe to toe with any traditional novel out there for sheer entertainment.characters.

B002UWH8SS|5.0|If you're a fan of the other Stargates, this is required watching. With few character cross-overs and a darker contextual story, you'll find yourself just as engaged in the occasionally cheesy episodic mini-plots and overarching story lines as the earlier shows. Many of the actors/actresses have come from scifi lineages, and are just as fun to rediscover as the new, unseen faces.<br /><br />Highly recommended for all scifi and Stargate fans.

B00479SVBU|2.0|Mine worked fine for two weeks, then started acting up and quit after two weeks and a day.  First sign of problem was that it dropped out the right channel sound.  Then it stopped letting me change the frequency.  Finally it would only light up a blank screen.  But, while it worked, it worked fairly nice.  The transmitter was stronger than any other FM transmitter I have used, as it worked hiss free on multiple free channels.  The sound quality of the mp3s were somewhat degraded, and didn't sound anywhere near CD or even FM radio quality.  The same 320bps music that sounds great on my mp3 player sounded a bit distorted, without good dynamic range, on this mp3 player.  The sound was the same whether it came through my mp3 player, or from the SD card.  I never tried a USB memory stick.  My device was difficult to put into the DC power slot.  It fit so tight that it was difficult to install, twist to orient it, or remove it.  I was afraid I was going to break it putting it in and worried about pulling the my dc adapter out of my car console when I pulled it out.  It is amazing that someone else said that their's fit loose.  I also didn't like the long power post, as it raises the unit way up high above my console.  If it was shorter, it would have almost looked like it was a factory install.  With it up so high, it was getting bumped by my gear shift.  Being so tall also prohibits putting a power splitter on to simultaneously use my GPS device.  I hated that it didn't stop and start at the same spot in the songs. The bookmark \\"feature\\" is a problem.  I also didn't like that inserting the mp3 mini plug did not interrupt play from the SD card.  So I had to pause the SD music if I hooked up my mp3 player.  Aside from all of this, I really did like that I could put 99 CDs worth of music at my disposal.  The sound quality was acceptable, and with the strong FM transmitter, it works nice for an older car without an mp3 adapter.  Now if they could only make it work for longerthan two weeks, I'd consider getting another one.

140131046X|5.0|I have read numerous books written by Mitch. I have thoroughly enjoyed them all but this one is my favourite.  His real art in my opinion is the way he captures the passion in his stories.  He is able to create expression in his writing that absorbs the reader, you can sympathize with characters and relate to the way they think and feel.  This is a big reason I like to read (and write), it allows me to escape for those moments in time.  As this was a non-fiction it was even more evident in his writing.    I was done this book in two sittings and I would have finished it in one if I hadn't starting reading it so late at night.    5 out of 5
0316098329|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book very much. It was a little difficult in the first few pages to get myself acclimated with the style of writing but also love that it was true to the perspective of a 5 yr old.  I am a mystery/thriller & chick lit kind of person and this was definitely a great book for something \\"different\\".
B003L77GGK|5.0|The first time I watched Supernatural I was hooked. This show is in my top 3 must own series. If you have never watched supernatural you are missing out.

If you do not own it, now is a good time to add it to you list. BUY IT!
0670022411|1.0|I had heard an interview on NPR with Deborah Harkness and hoped that this would be as described  - \\"Harry Potter for grown-ups\\".  However the book turned out to be basically a romance novel (not very good plot) involving witches and vampires, and it was just silly.  Deborah Harkness knows how to put sentences together, and she knows about scholarly research, so these are used in the book to frame an embarrassingly awful plot and truly tacky romance.  The book is set up for a sequel, and I will make sure to miss it.
B00004YC2F|4.0|Arcadi Volodos is one of the greatest living pianists, and excells in Rachmaninoff's shorter works.The 3rd Concerto seems to escape him however, in that he gives a fragmented performance rather than bringing all 3 movements together as a single statement.During the opening of the first movement both piano and orchestra are out of sinc with one another for about 6 pages.The performance is therefore technically perfect in that he plays all the right notes in the most fiendishly difficult passages, but musically wanting.The high point of this CD is the individual solo works.<br /><br />During the solo pieces he is so spontaneous and natural, the music flows as if he were breathing it to life which he most certainly does.Right up there with Richter and Horowitz.<br /><br /> This CD is therefore a testament to romantic and virtuoso pianism at its very finest where miniature masterpieces are concerned.The sound throughout is excellent.away.
B0041KKYCY|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect when I sat down to watch this, but I have to admit, I loved it!  Lots of fast paced action and a great story line.  The actors were a perfect selection for this movie, too.  I would highly recommend this movie to any horror/terror movie fan.
B004ZP37ZQ|5.0|this was a GREAT episode! the entire season up to this point has been questionable and choppy at best...but this ep really felt like the Supernatural i loved prior to this season...five stars all the way! keep writing like this and i'll definitely be back for season 7.

B0031SCV46|4.0|It looks nice, keys feel professional. All the knobs are useless unless you are using compatible DAW software. I also wish it had a standard MIDI out as in the old model. If I equate with any other plastic input device(such as PC keyboard) with good responding keys, then I guess I'm happy. Beware of power issues when hooked to a laptop (even when plugged into the wall).
0756404738|5.0|I gave this review 5 stars not because it's a perfect book, but because I enjoyed it more than I've enjoyed any other novel (aside from The Name of the Wind) in a long time. The writing is stunning, the characters (even the minor ones, and even the ones you loathe, like Denna) are fully realized, the action is thrilling, the magic is innovative, and the world overall is a huge breath of fresh air. I didn't feel let down by the lack of advancement of the Chandrian plot. I certainly didn't feel like nothing happened, or that Kvothe hadn't grown. People upset that his time with Adem didn't teach him \\"discipline\\" don't seem to understand that Kvothe was largely acting the whole time. He is, first and foremost, a performer. That allows him to mold to any situation.     People's main problems with the book seem to be their expectation that this is a traditional trilogy. By Rothfuss' own admission, he pretty much shoehorned it into a trilogy format. I'm sure Rothfuss could have created smaller, better contained novels if he planned further, but that doesn't diminish my enjoyment of the story at all. It's also pretty clear that the the next book won't be the last. Even if we finish the adventures of the young Kvothe, older Kvothe still has plenty of adventures. The series also smacks of post-modernism and magical realism, and those genres simply don't conform to storytelling norms. You can see this where Kvothe the narrator skips over large portions of his story, because he decides it's unimportant.     I will agree that the Felurian part is strange, especially in comparison to the Adem part. Kvothe learns sex in exactly the same way he learns martial arts, and it's bizarre. But there are some great adventures Fae, like his acquisition of the Enshaden, or his encounter with the Ctaeth (SP?). I know some people saw that as the ultimate dues ex machina, but I saw it as the literal embodiment of Freewill vs Fate. Kvothe certainly didn't seem to think that all his actions werebecause he spoke to some magical tree.
0300169787|5.0|Remember that first McQueen book that came out, the horrible one, that all of us McQueen fans wasted our money on? This book is the opposite. Its what I was expecting and then some. Its a high quality testament to his legacy, its done beautifully and at 27$ its a steal, you must buy this book. the cover of the book is a hologram of mcqueens face which morphs into that skeleton you see on picture. Its amazing. THANK YOU book gods!!!!
0545265355|5.0|I loved these books. I am so glad that I went ahead and bought all three together because I flew through each one and was able to immediately start the next. I am also certain that I will be re-reading these books as the movies come out, if not before. I would--and have already--recommend this trilogy to anyone who asks me what good books I've read lately.
B004LL1HM4|3.0|This is a good album but not as good as their previous one. The previous album sounded  wonderfully weird and completely unique. It remains one of the most played albums on my iTouch. The sound was difficult to describe. In some ways it was reminiscent of the Grateful Dead with its very atypical melodies and hooks. (The comparison to the Dead is a good thing- though it's fashionable to disparage the Dead and their followers, their seamless and ebullient amalgam of psychedelic and country music was extremely enjoyable.)    Helplessness Blues is not as weird and unique. Unlike the first album, it's very easy to describe: This song sounds like the Beach Boys, this song sounds like Dylan, this song sounds like Simon and Garfunkel etc. Much as I wanted to love this album, I only like it. And unlike the last album, I don't see it becoming one of the most played albums on my iTouch.
0316069353|5.0|As always, Connelly provides us a taut procedural story. His characters are believable to me, as are the events. My feelings about Mr. Haller are enhanced after reading this book, and I got a nice insight into his ex-wife, too. I hope Mr. Connelly will keep writing for another 50 years!
030746363X|2.0|After reading some of the negative reviews after I read the book, I decided to put two stars instead of one star so that if Mr. Ferriss decides in his goal-driven, screw-the-horses approach to life that he's going to have some expert mechanics take out the one-star reviewers, I'll just miss the cutoff.    The first few pages I was up for it, and even read a little bit to my wife, who was interested. I made it to the running section, skimming or skipping some, before giving up and telling her not to bother. I feel a little bit sorry for authors trying to follow up on huge success with a first book. Every author needs an editor, but here they are victims of a system where the editors are under such pressure to back a winner that they can't edit stuff they know is bad, because they don't want to presume to edit out what made the first book such a success. There is no way that the section on getting a woman across the finish line (at least in the section's current form) would have made it past any editor with a pulse if this were a first book. Although it makes for amusing dinner table conversation about how you opened up to the page with the crude anatomy drawing on the airplane next to the mom and her kid, ultimately I'm embarrassed for the author that his editor allowed him to sound like such an ass.       That being said, I can't honestly give it one star, because not everything in the book was bad, after all, if you contradict yourself, you may be 50% right, and not everything in a book has to be interesting, enjoyable, or sound. Admittedly I have little business writing a review as I was not able to finish the whole book. But like many people it did rub me the wrong way (in under 15 minutes without a chart) that there would be so many suspicious 5 star reviews on Day 1. If someone is going to play that game, I'm going to feel free to put up my review of the parts of this book I was subjected to, thanks.

B004T5R2HQ|5.0|I used it on my HTC Thunderbolt to scan and email a prescription. On my end it was as simple as taking a picture, and the medical supply house said the PDF was perfectly clear.    I have only used it that one time but it came in very handy.

B0046M4H70|5.0|This is a very striking film.  The Amazon editorial review describes it quite well.  The change-of-gender scene is done quite strikingly.  Very likeable.
B004A8ZWTW|5.0|If abandoned castles, gray storm-gathering English landscapes, moon-drenched love scenes, and tales of Romantic woe are your cup of tea - then my dear friend this is the movie for you!     I'm sorry to admit that I am no expert on the many adaptations of this novel, nor have I read the novel itself, but if this is so it is only because I did not find the earlier movie versions all that memorable and they never really inspired me to read the book, until now. From the opening scene I really felt that director Cary Fukunaga was doing something new here, something unique. In one interview, Fukunaga claims that he wanted to put more emphasis on the \\"spookiness\\" and \\"darker sides\\" of the book than any of the previous adaptations had, and that was precisely my impression. In fact one might argue (though I for one would not) that it is gloomy to a fault, with its constant brooding atmosphere, coupled with a hushed, wandering soundtrack that never takes flight into a conventional sweeping \\"theme\\" even in the happy moments, so I do understand why the person in the seat behind me fell to sleep half way through when I first saw the film at the theatre, sort of. But oh well, personally, I don't remember ever having been more alert during any of the Bronte or Austen films as I was in this one. I simply didn't want it to end! And I cannot wait to see it again.    For all it's gray clouds and dark candle lit rooms, there was one constant blaze of sunshine, and that is Mia Wasikowska, that stunningly beautiful, milk white creature fallen from heaven who plays Jane Eyre. Gorgeous and genuine, she immediately captured my heart. Casting her as Jane was, in my opinion, a stroke of genius.     Which is not to overlook the rest of the cast. Fassbender as Mr. Rochester, for example, was perfectly dark and mysterious yet passionate. You really loathe him at first and then grow to adore him.     The script was direct yet elegant, the costumes simple yet beautiful, the cinematography dark andmonochromatic yet brilliant.     It may not be for everyone, but this hauntingly beautiful film is bound to be a favorite of many.

0198326769|5.0|I saw the movie which is a must for anyone who read the book.  The book gave insight into the boy's thoughts and by reading it you really do not know exactly what happened at the end.  I have never been so affected by a movie as I was with this one and the combination of the book and movie is quite a moving experience.
B004DI7HZ6|1.0|I was suckered into buying this e-book based on the rave reviews.  What a mistake!  This book is so bad it should be a crime.  It is a bodice ripper of the worst sort.  The reviewer who compared the plotline to the television show Bewitched was spot on.  Thank goodness the new Erik Larson novel will be available for download tomorrow because I'm deleting this trash today.
0316069353|1.0|I bought this book through audible.com and do not have an issue with a premium price being asked of Kindle owners.    As a long-time Connelly fan, it pains me to give one of his novels a bad review.  But this was really bad.   Boring, iterative, predictable, poorly written, unimaginative are all adjectives that come to mind.   Who is ghostwriting Connelly's \\"works\\" while he's enjoying the riches justly deserved from his earlier, much more readable stuff?
0470932139|5.0|This book is essential in the library of those who love taking pictures of your food. It is the most comprehensive manual that I have seen. It is written with great technical clarity while at the same time approachable and filled with passion.   I am a very visual learner and was so happy to see so many photographs that illustrate the differences between varying aperture, shutter speed and ISO, for example.   So happy to have this book as I will refer to it often.

0060005688|4.0|The Paradox of Choice is a very interesting and great book written by Barry Schwartz.  The author discusses the number of choices a person faces in life. He shows how we make the decisions we do given the many options we have. He then leads into the problems that are created by these numerous options. I love the practical application and examples of this book. After reading every chapter, I could identify how and where in life I use strategies found in the book to make decisions. However, I did not like the last chapter of this book. It tries to suggest ways that we can make better choices so we do not suffer and become overwhelmed. The chapter did not give very many or specific ways to overcome any of the problems. It seemed to conclude that they are always going to be problems we must fight. It was a depressive ending to the book. Overall though, I would still recommend reading this book to understand and gain insight into how decisions are made and to become aware of the dangers of too many choices.
1400052181|5.0|What an amazing story.  I was surprised at how easy it was to read, extremely well written and enjoyable.  I learned a great deal and have passed it on to many family members and friends.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|The thing you guys don't seem to understand is why Lucas MUST do this. Lucasfilm is an INDEPENDENT production company, which means he is self sufficient and doesn't rely on Hollywood for funding. He hasn't had any funding from Hollywood since the 70's. In order to maintain this independence, sometimes you have to \\"sell your wares\\" so to speak in order to fund the next projects. Filmmkaing is a hard game on level and for Lucas to achieve what he has in his career is nothing short of a miracle. He is the epitome of the self made filmmaking mogul. Something SO many filmmakers yearn for, but rarely if ever achieve in any long term manner. And he did it on one project, one story. If you've guys have been paying attention to what he has been doing you would know that he is prepping all six Star Wars films to be presented in 3D in the next few years. This is a time consuming and very costly endeavor. So, with such a massive undertaking underway, why in God's name would he NOW do an ultimate edition, which is essentially the final word? He didn't want to have the fans wait like they had to do with the DVD sets and he also needs the money to pull off all the future projects. So, he's basically compromising to try to satisfy everyone for right now and also get his work done. And you guys have the GALL to complain like spoiled brats! He gave you the original films on DVD when he had no intention orignally...what more do you want??? If you dont want these editions to hold you over, just don't buy them, but know you may be hindering greater work down the road. You guys are almost like investors in Lucasfilm every time you purchase SW product so stop whining and be patient, because TRUST and BELIEVE...there is INCREDIBLE MIND BLOWING stuff coming down the road for the future of Star Wars and when it's said and done, when the FINAL WORD is said...I don't think ANYONE will be dissapointed. Lucas cares for the fans...but do you really care for him? GROW UP PEOPLE....this is NOT 1977! Truly GREAT work takes TIME.
0439023521|2.0|This book could have been great - it has an interesting plot.... but the characters are very one dimensional and the unfolding of the story very cliched. By the second half of the book the outcome was entirely predictable. Not interested in reading the sequels.
B0045HCJT4|5.0|I watched this in the theater when it first came out. I loved it. Since then I have spoken to many people about the movie and most say the same thing, Kurt Russel's character is terrible. He doesn't show any personal growth, he's wooden and one dimensional. To me this is the excellent part of the movie. His character is not trying to grow or become something more than he is. He is happy with what he is. He has not remorse about his past. He is a soldier. The special effects are excellent. The other characters are enjoyable. Not every movie has to have a lesson or moral. Some are just fun.

0316921173|1.0|The worst, most frustrating book I have ever read.  When I finished I wanted to hurl it across the room.  What a massive piece of crap.  And I mean massive - 1088 pages.  And yes, I read the whole damn thing.  Talk about self absorbed belly-button lint picking.  In fact, I think it was in that book that I learned the word \\"omphaloskepsis.\\"  I am a well educated guy; I have read, and enjoyed other large works like Moby Dick and War and Peace.  Infinite Jest I had to read with a dictionary at my elbow.  The problem was it wasn't an unabridged dictionary, and most of the $5 words I had to look up weren't even in my dictionary.  The guy just liked trying to impress with his vocabulary - or his computer's thesaurus.  The worst part was that there were some 5 different plot lines, that seemed to be spiraling toward one another, and then the book just ends without resolving a single one of them, nor connecting them.  I think the title refers to the joke on the readers who bought into the narcissistic garbage that was spewed across the pages of this doorstop.  I am still pissed I wasted so much time reading it.  Infinite Jest indeed.
0525422943|5.0|Read this one in 2-days and have to say that it's even better than If I Stay, which I thought was pretty darn good. Like the characters, the reader will gain closure with Where She Went. I don't want to give too much of the story away, but I thought the author did a great job of making the reader feel the main characters anger, pain, confusion and later, joy.  I thoroughly enjoyed both series books.

B00475AYJQ|5.0|I have been enamored by Pat's prose since NotW came out. With WMF, it only solidifies this man as a premier storyteller this generation. I rank his original work above anything I have read in over a decade. This second installment captures some truly great scenes but there are slow moments to build up the action sequences and there are still individuals like Denna that get on your nerves. Do I blame the author for her shortcomings? Well we all know someone that doesn't endear themselves to our hearts but a story is a story even with characters that have blemishes just like in real life. The work here is sensational none-the-less. Please get the next one out sooner!

B0014JGDUC|5.0|I definitely recommend wearing socks with these. Unlike the standard Crocs, these don't have the ventilation holes. Why no vent holes? In a kitchen environment, spills are quite likely to occur and the vent holes would allow the entry of liquids (worst case scenario, HOT Liquids) into the shoe.....Not A Good Thing. Also because of the lack of vent holes, foot moisture would build up.....Uncomfortable.....socks mitigate that quite well.<br />The Bistro Crocs tend to run small, I went one size smaller than my regular shoe size. Good thing I went to a place that sold Crocs first to make sure the size I was going to order would be correct.<br />I bought my Crocs to complete my Competition wardrobe for the 2nd 8th Grilled Cheese Invitational (Chef Jacket & Pants & Bistro Crocs) I found them to be very comfortable and light on my feet as I was standing most of the time. At the end of the day, I had little to no leg/knee/foot fatigue or pain.<br />I do have to agree what most people have to say about Crocs.....They are *UGLY*<br />But when it calls for sacrifice of style over comfort, Crocs fit the bill perfectly.<br />Easy to step in and out of.<br />Great for kicking casually around the house.<br />Wonderful for those times standing in front of the stove, or working in the kitchen.<br />Just keep these far, far, far away from any Haute Couture......These things are pure Fashion Suicide to wear in public, guaranteed to get your pic in peopleofwallmart.com

0061928356|5.0|Secret Daughter by Shilpi Somaya Gowda was such a great read for me! It'll be making my favorites list for this year. I'm already quite fond of novels that take me away to another place and culture and Secret Daughter does just that. This is a powerful novel that delves deeply into culture, motherhood, and a person's identity; it is both heartbreaking and uplifting.<br /><br />The novel shifts between two compelling story lines, one taking place in India and one in America. The year is 1984 and a baby girl is born to Kavita in a small village in India. Her first daughter had been taken away by her husband's family and killed. She was not going to have that happen to this one. Instead she takes her daughter to an orphanage in the hopes that she will have a better life or at the very least, a chance at one. She names her Usha which means dawn and leaves with her one silver bangle that she slips on Usha's ankle.<br /><br />A world away doctors, Somer and Krishnan, have been trying to have a child. Unfortunately it turns out that Somer is unable to have children having gone into early menopause in her thirties. She is devastated and feels betrayed by her body. Krishnan tells her that they have other options. His mother has been telling him about an orphanage in Bombay and all the children that need adopting there. As Krishnan is from India, he feels that this would be a good match for them. At first Somer is hesitant but eventually she agrees to adopt from India. They travel to India and eventually bring home their baby who is named Asha, but was born Usha.<br /><br />As the story evolves we see life from both sides. We see the agony that Kavita goes through having had to give up her daughter even though she knows it was for the best - she just wishes she knew for sure what would become of her daughter. Jasu, her husband moves them to Mumbai in the hopes of giving a better life for their son Vijay who they had the year after Usha. Life doesn't go well for them in the beginning; there are many hardships to endure, but eventually things turn around for them and life gets better. Surprisingly for how much I disliked Jasu for not wanting daughters I thought that ultimately he ended up being a good husband and really did love Kavita. No matter what was going on in their lives, whether good or bad, Kavita could not ever forget the baby girl she had to give up.<br /><br />Somer and Krishnan are having their own struggles. Well Somer is anyhow. Much of the time she really feels out of place in her own family. Asha and Krishnan have their heritage in common but she has never really been that interested in learning much about Krishnan's culture. As well she really tries to steer Asha towards life in America, clearly forgetting that the girl needs to learn about her own culture. Asha really wants to learn about her culture and meet her relatives in India - so much so that she ends up getting a grant to go to India and write a story about the underprivileged there.<br /><br />So begins Asha's search for her birth parents and her delight in meeting this family that aren't even her blood relatives but take her in and love her like one of their own. Back in America Somer and Krishnan have separated and this is just what Somer needs to get her life back. She realizes that along the way she gave up her identity and herself for her family and all she really succeeded in doing was taking away that piece of herself that made her so special. As she begins to like herself again she learns that sometimes love means compromising yourself even when it's not really what you wanted to do.<br /><br />Secret Daughter by Shilpi Somaya Gowda is a fantastic novel! It is emotional and powerful. The author writes beautifully and her descriptions of India, the food, and the culture are amazing. I felt I was right there within the pages of this story tasting the spicy food or picking out a sari to wear. I can't even pick out a favorite character because this is oneof those books in which you feel drawn to all of them. I did however feel more drawn to the story line in India but only because I loved to read about a culture that is so different from my own. There are some parts of the book that I found upsetting like what happens to baby girls and just how women are treated in general but that is part of India and the story. If you enjoy novels that enable you to learn about another culture while reading a story that will tug on your heart then Secret Daughter is one you should pick up!them.

B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I loved it. All the actors were fantastic, with Mary-Louise Parker being so entertaining that even with such top box office draw as Willis, Freeman, Mirren & Malkovitch I enjoyed her scenes the most. She was just so genuine - be it really irritated or really entertained. Fantastic job.    The story has a few unique twists and turns that keep the plot moving and interesting. Lots of action (which Bruce Willis is spectacular at IMO) and plenty of humor with some drama mixed in for good measure. Malkovitch plays an excellent nut job, and Morgan Freeman and Helen Mirren are outstanding as always. I have to say - I prefer Karl Urban as a good guy but he does a good job as an agent doing his job even while you don't like him very much for it. I like him more as Bones in Star Trek but not because he isn't good here - he is. Just a personal preference.    All in all a film I will watch and enjoy repeatedly.
B003Y5H4SO|4.0|It was 80 minutes well-spent. It could have been better if more bloodshed and more suspense were added. It could have been worse had the acting been likewise but the acting saves the day! I am suprised at the reviews here, but there are a few things that saved the movie: excellent, convincing acting; well-written script and flow of the movie; and the awesome, sweeping UPSIDE-DOWN opening shots of downtown Philadelphia, with the camera rolling in from the Camden, New Jersey side over the river, that dwarf anything you have seen before!!! Buy it/see it only for those few things!
B002VECLVO|5.0|There are movies in which Colin Firth's ability to stony and almost emotionless countenance really fits the part. A\\" A Single Man\\" is a glorious example. Firth plays George Falconer, an British teacher of college English in 1962 Los Angeles. We know the year because televisions and radios endless broadcast stories about the Cuban Missile Crisis. We learn almost immediately that Falconer is gay, and that his lover and friend, Jim, has been killed in a traffic accident. Bereft, Falconer becomes suicidal. Being British, he need to put his affairs in tidy order first. These include friendships with Charley (Julianne Moore), a boozy, spurned woman whose husband dumped her for someone younger and more beautiful. Falconer also meets a number of gay and maybe-gay men, including one of his students, who become touch points and opportunities to reminisce about his now-lost relationship. Some might think this an obvious or cloying visual device, but Falconer's inner moods are shown by the saturation of color on the screen. When he is engaged with another person, the colors are vibrant; when he becomes morose, the colors are muted. A repeating motif of Firth floating nude in a dark sea also becomes a clue to his inner listlessness and despair.<br /><br />\\"A Single Man\\" explores the grief of a man who is not allowed to grieve publicly for the man he loved. The early 1960s were still an extremely buttoned-up era for homosexuals. They rendered their sexuality invisible as a means of self-protection, and were years away from beginning to assert their rights to be seen as persons. Firth's choice as Falconer was nearly perfect; sometimes it seems he can't depict ANY emotions. The plotline took the characters to unexpected and mostly unfulfilled places. A moving and often sad story of a grieving man's attempting to break the surface of his own despair and loss, and of a society unwilling to let him.
B00466HN6S|1.0|About a bunny who poops jelly beans and some how lives in a mansion. About a man with no ambition other than becoming an Easter bunny. Sadly, he does not achieve said dream and becomes a \\"co-Easter bunny\\". A movie with absolutely no depth, or meaning. Not even my seven year old sister found this funny. Oh yeah, and I only gave it one star cause I had to put in a rating.
B001DCQI8W|5.0|This is unquestionably one of Karajan's greatest achievements. And it's hard to imagine a better Bruckner cycle than this. I've listened to Bruckner for a long time and own at least 5 recordings of each symphony. Every one of these performances ranks up there with the best (I must single out the performance of the 5th, absolutely THE best I've ever heard!). There is not a weak performance in the box. And you simply will not hear these symphonies played better than here. The Berlin Philharmonic is glorious. Karajan was often accused of producing beauty just for beauty's sake, but here it is always at the service of the music. In these grand, epic works where other conductors can get lost or lose tension in certain areas, Karajan has an incredible ability to comprehend the structure of each movement, keep it flowing, and make each transition from section to section sound effortless and natural. A great term I once heard to describe it was \\"architectural far-sightedness\\". Tempo choices throughout strike me as having an ideal balance of energy and grandeur. And the all important Adagios have plenty of time to breathe without ever dragging.     There have been some slightly negative comments about the sound quality. I thought the analog recordings (4-9) were excellent. All the sections of the orchestra were brilliantly caught. I would say some of the big climaxes in the symphonies recorded in early digital (1-3) sound a little harsh and congested, but nothing major enough to detract from the performances. Also, Karajan uses the 1889 version of the 3rd. Though I prefer the 1873 or 1877 versions, it's no big deal.     Whether you know Bruckner well, or you've never heard a note he's written, I give this set my strongest possible recommendation. It's a perfect introduction to this music, and a perfect addition to any Classical library. (And getting this 9 disc set for 40 bucks is just robbery!)
1400052181|4.0|Some stories stick with you, marinating, festering, always present. They might piss you off, make you happy, confuse you, but you keep thinking about them. Henrietta Lacks' story is like that.<br /><br />As a young mother suffering from cancer in a segregated US, Lacks unknowingly changed the course of medical history. But her identity and contribution to science remained a secret to most of the world.<br /><br />In 1976, the American magazine Rolling Stone featured an article about Henrietta Lacks and her family. They were also the subject of a 1996 documentary by the BBC called The Way of All Flesh and articles in Ebony and Science80. But not until the publishing of The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, by Rebecca Skloot, has the whole story been shared.<br /><br />To explain the tremendous impact Lacks had, it is essential to go into the details of her medical history and of medical research. Though that sets up the possibility for a very dull narrative, Skloot deftly explains the material and focuses on the human element in such a way that readers will be sucked in.<br /><br />In doing research for this story, Skloot painstakingly gains the trust of Lacks' surviving children, especially her daughter Deborah. Through interviews with them, relatives, physicians and researchers, a story slowly builds.<br />In the 1950s Lacks was treated for a cancer that was later diagnosed as cervical cancer. Although treated in a segregated ward at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore, Maryland, she received care that was considered to be the best available for African Americans. Despite this, Lacks died as a result of her cancer at the age of 31, leaving behind five children and her husband.<br /><br />At that same at John Hopkins, George Gey was busily researching how to keep cells alive and growing. It wasn't until Gey received a sample of Lacks' cells that he found success. And a lot of it. Lacks' cells, named HeLa after the first two initials in Lacks' first and last names, grew at a great rate and didn't stop. These cells were a huge scientific discovery that would change medical research and patient rights forever.<br /><br />After a few false starts, Gey developed a way to send samples of HeLa around the world.

B004TTMYQG|2.0|I had the app for weeks and it was great, but then I would add appointments and it wouldn't save. I liked it, but too bad it stopped working.
B004J8I00Q|4.0|I have read some works by Jane Austen, however, I have never read Sense and Sensibility until now.  It is a story about two sisters, one is prudent and the other is outright passionate.  You get to see Elinor and her sister Marianne go through a changing process by the end of the book.<br /><br />What is really neat about this book is that there are notes typed in the side margin to help you understand the story and to give you other entertainment facts of the story.  This is helpful for those who want to understand the works of famous authors.<br /><br />I received a review copy via Bethany House.
B00012QM8G|5.0|I don't want to repeat what was already said about this great masterpiece. But I don't like the ending when Jewish people are liberated by a ridiculous Russian officer on a pony. I am pretty sure that if the people were liberated by an American he would look cool and would receive warm welcome. But nobody ever wants give credit to Russians, although they did the most to defeat Nazis.
B004UID2LC|3.0|a good app but useless without the ability  to search videos.  though the picture in the description shows it...but the option isn't there.  too bad bc this would be a great app
B001UV4XHY|5.0|I LOVED this movie.  It's epic, suspenseful, Drama emotional, and even a bit of humor every now and again.  It was very well done, and completely worth watching!
030746363X|5.0|I was already in decent shape but this book took it to the next level, never had abs before and there they were in 3 weeks!
B003V4AK8E|5.0|I bought this after trying the rocket fish one because it had blue tooth. The pro A is way better. If you have mediumish to large hands this is a great controller. i have experienced no lag or analog dead zones in 3rd or first person shooters. the texture is a touch uncomfortable if you squeeze the controller to hard because of excitement.
B004L49K20|4.0|\\"Before the Rain\\" is an exquisite song, on par with \\"The Seventh Stranger\\" or \\"The Chauffeur.\\"  The song just aches and aches, and in that respect it's more heartbroken than \\"The Seventh  Stranger,\\" though not as mysterious.  An exquisite melody that haunts you--so far this is the  most piercing track on the album, and easily worth buying the album for:  this will end up   being one of my favorite songs of the year.
B004SQS9FA|1.0|This album was a true disappointment for this die hard Radiohead fan. A mishmash of garbled vocals, repetitive drum loops, and soulless melodies, The King of Limbs is a real snooze fest. Every song sounds like it could have been made entirely on a computer except perhaps for Give Up the Ghost, which has an actual guitar and drums. But even that song had some unintelligible vocal loop repeating annoyingly in the left speaker only. It pains me to give this only 1 star, so I tried to find some redeeming value to this album, perhaps a hidden gem, but after repeated listens I found I hated it more and more.    Radiohead needs to stop tinkering around on their laptops and get back to making real music.
B0026OE2O8|4.0|Incredibly shot  (almost all gorgeous helicopter shots from all over the world),<br />very well meaning, but slightly preachy and simplistic documentary pleading<br />for global awareness about climate change.<br /><br />Really worth seeing for the images, and a worthwhile message, if a bit heavy<br />handed.  My only other slight problem;  by having almost everything shot<br />from above the visual impact ultimately starts to wear off just a bit.<br /><br />But this sounds more critical than I mean to be.  It isn't often a film makes<br />you gasp with the quality of its images, and look at the world (literally)<br />in a new way.
0525951652|5.0|I read this book and wanted to share it with some friends so I ordered a couple copies to send.  I understand they received their copy, but since it is a 1,000 page book, I haven't heard if they have finished reading it yet or how they liked it.
B002HFP0R4|5.0|I love that there is a CD featuring each of the brothers.  It's also a great collection and I didn't hear any that I didn't like.  If you've been a Bee Gees fan for most of your life (as I have) and you're looking for a collection that will feature all (or most, depending on your preferences) of your favorites, I highly recommend this collection.
B004Q1FDHO|5.0|I have wasted so much time playing this game. Its a lot of fun. In fact Im going to waste more time playing it now lol!
B004Q1FDHO|5.0|love this game! it works perfectly on my Evo Shift. I did not expect this game to be so well made and addictive. I play it more than any other phone app.
1595826971|5.0|I have been a huge Alice fan since I played the original on the PC. I was really glad to see that a sequel was being made, and knew I had to pick this Artbook up as well. The book is a nice size which is great. It is a hardcover, and the pages are thick and very nice quality. The colors and art can be appreciated with the bigger size and the better quality paper.     The content is beyond incredible. The art in the book comes with blurbs about the piece from the artist or a producer, and it often goes into detail about the piece, why it was made, and what the goal for the piece was. Most of the work is concept art, but they are of high quality. There is alot of complete pieces with full color and depth. Not just sketches or storyboards which is common in alot of artbooks you get as preorder bonuses with games.  The book is broken into chapters, with each chapter giving insight on an aspect of the game, such as preproduction or Wonderland locations. Each chapter has art pertaining to the theme. So in preproduction, you see alot of the brainstorming and ideas that came up early in the game's development that ended up getting cut from the game. It's a real treat to see. Even the design of the characters are in detail.    The book is about 170 pages or so, and has a ton of material to go through. I could not put the book down, and finished it in a day. It was just really good and kept my interest up the whole time.    If I have any small gripes, it is that a few of the pieces which are VERY interesting, have no blurbs about them. There were a couple of pictures I had really hope had some context to it, but it only lists who did them. About 5% of the pictures have no blurbs. Also, some of the artwork isn't talked about enough. For example, there is a really neat picture released when the game was announced of alice scaling a tower crawling with snails and a mechanical snail at the top. The piece is here, but is only briefly discussed. Another minor gripe is that book isa bit spoilerish in that it shows some of the new characters and the new look of original characters. Also, in talking about the levels, alot of information is given about them, which kind of gives away a tiny bit of the story. It doesn't ruin the story by any means though. I couldn't fathom an artbook without ALL the material either, so I am glad it wasn't cut out for the sake of being spoilerish. I do wish there was a disclaimer somewhere though.     Still, this is an excellent book, and one I enjoyed. I hope you enjoy it too!
0316067601|5.0|Up until I read this book I only had an idea of what the NAVY SEALS were all about.  Now, I have an idea of the physical and mental training these warriors go through.  I also have a better understanding of the word Valor. The detailed description of the battle between these 4 brave SEALS and an overwhelming enemy is one that boggles the mind.  The final moments of three members of the SEAL team will make you feel pride in the American spirit and the NEVER GIVE UP attitude of our nations finest.  The days that Marcus Lutrell was under the protection of the local tribe is an amazing story of courage in the face of tyranny.  Taking the lessons learned in this book it to heart will change how you approach many of lifes challenges.
B004IQMXD4|5.0|I can only see this cd being popular with Stevie fans or coffee house enthusiasts when selections are randomly played. Personally its much better than I expected for a 62yo Stevie and is on par with her previous CD. The romance-novel cover art is disappointing but for those of us who know Stevie its very much her. My favorite is Moonlight (the vampire song) because it takes me back to the Stevie of the early 80s. It has a 'Nightbird' feel to it. I think this would be a solid choice for collectors, especially of southern California rock.
B004ZISQ1I|5.0|This episode has everything: mystery, intelligence, drama, humor, and a truly wonderful story. No spoilers. But be warned that you may tear up at the ending. The episode is believable and lovely. The episode also very much belongs to Hodges and Angela...
B004K4IZ3G|4.0|Got both Tron and Tron:  Legacy on Blue Ray.  Like them both and love the plot of these stories.
0307272702|5.0|I can't say enough about this book. Since reading it, I have lost 30 pounds in three months, and feel so much better. I no longer snore, my old clothes fit and my back feels better than ever. While it is not like your traditional diet book, it is very informative on the evils of carbs (simple carbs) and the effect it has on your body (especially insulin). Chapters 11 through 13 are so good, I have read them 3 or 4 times now. The essence of losing weight is controling this insulin release and staying focused. Go buy this book. You'll be glad you did.
B004KPLVW2|4.0|As good now as it was when it first came out for release.  Still good visual for the time frame.  Glad to add to my libary.
B00009NQQO|5.0|I bought this for my 20 month old.  For several weeks, we used it in the kitchen on the refridgerator or on the glass of the back door.  My son loves it!  Now it's in the bath, getting more use than any of his other bath toys.  If you don't like that it does not have a hole in the bottom, the mesh material could be easily cut with scissors and would not fray or need to be sewn.  I have found the suction cups to be super strong.  I'm wondering if other reviewers have porous tile that is not good for suction cups.
B003XRELGQ|4.0|I don't want to spend too much time writing a review of what is, in essence, a classic novel.  This is my first reading of Cat's Cradle, and my first time reading anything of substantial length by Kurt Vonnegut.  The simple reason I don't want to spend too much time reviewing this book is that it has already been reviewed countless times, especially by people far more familiar with it than I am.    SPOILER ALERT!  This is a short book, and it's almost impossible to avoid spoiling even the ending while trying to discuss significant aspects of the work.  Also, this book has been around a while, meaning it's highly unlikely you won't have heard at least a capsule summary of the plot.  That said, the following two paragraphs reveal details near the end of the book.    There were only two things I found disappointing in the story:  First, there was no speculation nor explanation given as to why there would suddenly be purple-mouthed tornadoes all over the place.  Perhaps that was just the author's speculation about the knock-on effects of all the Earth's water suddenly converting to ice-nine.    Second, there was mention of a strange nimbus (\\"lavender corona\\") surrounding the \\"weird plug\\" of rock sitting on the back of Mt. McCabe, and it wasn't clear if this was some strange phenomenon or not; the narrator spoke of his desire to visit this formation, to climb it, but he never reports doing so.  It's an unexplored detail, and in such a slender volume, such things make me wish for more.    The writing was excellent: literate, trenchant and witty.  This is my first foray into Vonnegut, so I have no other points of reference to go by.    The Rosetta Books edition of this Kindle e-book seems to fall somewhere between the ultra-cheap e-books (free or $0.99) and the premium e-books (with list prices close to those of the print editions) sold by Amazon -- both in terms of price and in terms of general quality.  This edition was mostly decent, but had some typesetting issues withpunctuation (wrong type of quote or apostrophe used -- open quote instead of close quote, for instance).  Further, there were several cases where it was obvious that the text was obtained using OCR of a print edition, and this manifested frequently as the wrong letter in a word, or a letter like \\"m\\" being replaced by \\"rn.\\"    I was never unable to determine what was truly meant in any passage, but the handful of flaws in this e-book could be easily corrected.
B001AX9DT0|5.0|Gossip in the Grain is better CD than Montagne's Trouble. Gossip in the grain presents more variety and creativity, showcasing Montagne's unusual voice. I'm curious about his other CDs, but I have a feeling that Gossip in the Grain is his best one to date.
B000003TA4|1.0|I RECENTLY POSTED A REVIEW ON NEVERMIND AND GOT SEVERAL SCOLDING MESSAGES FROM APPARENT DIE HARD NIRVANA FANS ACCUSING ME OF BEING VINCE NEIL. IM STILL LAUGHING. SO I PULLED IT AND WENT AND LISTEN TO NEVERMIND ONCE AGAIN FOR THE FIRST TIME IN YEARS IM SORRY BUT BY OPINION HASNT CHANGED.       WHILE THE PRICE OF CLASSIC 80S AND 90 ROCK BAND CDS ARE INCREASING AND BECOMING MORE AND MORE COLLECTABLE AND DESIREABLE BY EVEN TODAYS YOUTH ( WHO BELIEVE IT OR NOT KNOW TALENT WHEN THEY HEAR IT ) NEVERMIND CAN NOW BE BOUGHT BY PENNIES. ANYONE SEE MY POINT HERE?        THERE WAS NO TALENT IN THIS BAND WITH THE EXCEPTION OF DAVE GROHL AND HE HAD TO GET OUT OF NIRVANA TO ACHIEVE THAT. THE UNPLUGGED MTV NIRVANA THINGIE WAS A SHAM AND PROVES MY POINT NO TALENT HERE. KURT WAS ALL ABOUT HEY IM DIFFERENT DONT YOU WANT TO BE DIFFERENT TOO. APPARENTLY MANY DID.        BEFORE I GET KNOCKED ON THIS BEING A OPINION RATHER THAN A REVIEW LIKE LAST TIME OPINIONS OF NIRVANA FANS ARE BASICALLY ALL THAT THERE ARE ON HERE. MY REVIEW IS THAT THIS CD SUCKS. AND PLEASE STOP TRYING TO ASSOCIATE KOBAINS DEATH IN RELATION WITH ROCK LEGENDS SUCH AS JANIS JOPLIN JIMMY HENDRIX AND JIM MORRISON THAT IS ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS AS YOU CAN GET. AND FOR THOSE REVIEWS THAT STATED THAT THIS CD IS ONE YOU WOULD WANT ON A DESERTED ISLAND I DONT HESITATE TO SAY THAT WE PROBABLY WOULDNT FIND YOU SANE UPON YOUR RESCUE. MY PERSONAL CD COLLECTION IS NOW OVER 1000 STRONG AND IF I CHOSE TO LISTEN TO THEM ALL THIS WOULD BE MY 1000 TH CD PLAYED. OH WITH SOME HESITATION I MIGHT ADD.  AND NO I AM NOT VINCE NEIL . LONG LIVE ROCK TIME TO GO LISTEN TO SOME MOTORHEAD OR TORA TORA OR YEAH MAYBE SOME CRUE .
B002QW7ALM|3.0|Two guys awake from hyper-sleep and can't seem to remember anything right off.  We later find that they, other crew members, scientists, a few thousand passengers and cells of animals (Noah's ark), were supposedly going to \\"the new earth\\" cause man has finally screwed up the \\"old earth\\" to the point where it explodes. One of them goes to access power source to bring up the ship's systems and encounters crew members who also have memory loss. They then start to encounter strange beings who turn out to actually be the passengers who have mutated. It seems they have been in their hyper-sleep considerably longer than they realize. The movie consists of them trying to get to power source while avoiding these mutants.  Has a interesting ending as to where they actually are, how long they've been there and who actually suffered from Pandora (sort of a cabin fever, but in space).  Pay close attention.  May be hard to follow.
B004X0Y5GI|5.0|I'm what you call an \\"unlikely\\" fan of both Fleetwood Mac and Stevie Nicks. Being a 23 yr old black male, one would assume that I'm blasting Lil Wayne & Chris Brown, which I am..But when it comes to REAL music, I'm all over it!!! Thanks to Fleetwood Mac I listen to ALL music now and have been for many years now. They completely changed my life. I consider them as my \\"gateway drug\\" into the world of REAL music. Stevie Nicks is my all time favorite singer-songwriter...EVER!! Her words, her unique voice, her presence..She is just AWESOME!!!! So of course Tuesday, May 3, 2011 was a HUGE day for me. NOt only was my favorite show Glee doing a tribute to the greatest album of all time 'Rumours', but the Gypsy Queen of Rock n Roll herself was releasing her latest album. I was ECSTATIC!!! Of course Glee was excellent, but lets talk about the album!!!!!    1. Secret Love - I'm gonna be honest, this song grew on me. Didnt really like it at first and considering it being the lead single, I was kinda worried about what the album would sound like. But it grew on me, not one of my faves, but I still like it. Plus my professor told me that she had something from the late 70's with that song on it. She said when she listened to the album she kept wondering why she knew the song so well, LOL. I thought that was hilarious!!    2. For What Its Worth - I am not a fan of country at all, but this song captured me from the very first listen. Its a very poignant song. I love the way Stevie sings it with the harmonies. One of my favorites from the album!!!    3. In Your Dreams - I own just about every Stevie album so other Stevie fans can understand that I'm kinda use to the title track being the opening track, but this song still rocks....HARD!! It kinda puts me in the mind of \\"Enchanted\\"...I love it.    4. Wide Sargasso Sea - This song goes so hard!!! Fell in love with it the first listen!!! I really dont know what the title has to do with the song, but this song is AMAZING!!! I think, don't quote me on this, but I THINK Stevie is talking about an affair with a man....who was married...One night stand? Who knows but Stevie. I love how she makes you read between the lines. I wonder what she meant when she said \\"She burned his house down\\"....Mmm, this one makes you wonder...    5. New Orleans - Beautiful song..beautifully written. I dont know if it was written as a tribute to Hurricane Katrina but either way it is a cheerful ballad about a beautiful city.    6. Moonlight - Haunting song I must admit. This is the witchy woman Stevie I was waiting for!!!! The mood is dark and edgy!!! Can you say next single??? Supposedly it was written about Twilight, so imagining Bella and whats his name kinda brings this song to life. Even if Twilight never existed, this song would still be amazing!!!!    7. Annabel Lee - Oh how I love this song!! The chorus is just excellent!! \\"And the moon never beams, with out bringing me dreams\\"....I love it!!! The breakdown towards the end is amazing and adds a bit of an edge to the song....I love it when she goes \\"My LIFE, my life\\"    8. Soldier's Angel - A haunting ballad about falling soldiers and the women who carry on their names. A truly gripping song!! And the BIG bonus to this song is that is features none only than LINDSEY BUCKINGHAM!!!!! I recognized their voices together immediately!    9. Everybody Loves You - I LOVE the intro. Its very modern!! I wish Stevie would have used that beat on the rest of the song but its still nice. I wonder who its written about.    10. Ghost Are Gone - Now this is one of those head bobbin', toe tappin' rockers thats gonna make you move in some way. I love it!!     11. You May Be the Gone - This is an EPIC ballad that has the Stevie \\"sangin the blues\\".....and she sounds AMAZING!!!! The sound starts out as a bluesy groove and escalates into a symphony!! Also one of my favorites!!!    12. Italian Summer - I like this song...It didnt really stand out to me like the others, but its okay.    13. Cheaper Than Free - I like this song, I kinda dont agree with it being the second single, and I REALLY dont agree with it being the closing track. I wish \\"You May Be the One\\" would have been the closer...that would have been an epic way to close the album    All around this album is nothing short of EXCELLENT!!!! I was gonna buy this album whether it was good or bad simply because I love Stevie, but I was really shocked that it was THIS GOOD!!! I definitely recommend this album for anyone who knows good music when you hear it.
B00003CXBK|5.0|As always, Miyazaki delivers another masterpiece with Princess Mononoke. Set in 14th century Japan, it tells the story of a young prince named Ashitaka who must leave his people to find a cure for a curse he receives while defending his village from a boar-demon. He finds Iron Town and meets Lady Eboshi, a warrior women who runs the town and mines for iron. Her goal: to kill the forest god so no one will be able to stop her men from mining. Meanwhile, San (Princess Mononoke - who was raised by Moro the wolf god - is desperately trying to defend the forest from the humans who would try and destroy it.    There is no black and white villain in the story. The most likely candidate, Lady Eboshi, does try to kill the forest spirits, but also buys women out of brothels and gives them honest work. She also protects the lepers, those that would otherwise be complete outcasts with no way to support them. Although the story is set in the time of Japanese history that we normally romanticize (samurais, princesses in kimonos and emperors trying to avert assassination attempts, etc.) Miyazaki sets his story in a rural setting, where the emperor never appears in person, and samurais attack innocent villages. And of course, Miyazaki presents what is perhaps his most outright campaign for environmentalism. The forest he creates is large and wild, filled with gods and spirits that hate humans. However, to those that do not seek to harm the forest, the spirits can be fierce allies.     Overall, I would rate this as a very excellent movie. However, some parents might be concerned that there is too much violence and gore for their children. Yes, this is Miyazaki's most \\"graphic\\" movie, but it is limited to very specific scenes and emphasizes the point he is trying to make. War and progress often only result in the destruction of that which is most beautiful: nature and the human soul.
B002ZG976U|5.0|Burlesque was absolutely the best DVD I have bought in years!!  Cher was excellent!!!  Christina Aguilar was excellent!!!  And the dancing was exceptionally fantastic!!!
B004K4IZ54|5.0|I bought Tron on Amazon for the sam reason that I buy many things here: price. Tron was $10 cheaper than anywhere else I'd seen for the same movie in the same condition. I'm very happy to be able to have a site like this available.
B004R63MWQ|3.0|Without having seen the original, I found this movie to be enjoyable but not great. While there were lots of cool effects and action sequences, I would have enjoyed a more developed story.
B004G6009U|5.0|Love this movie, got as a gift from my daughter. I special love the fact that she went to amazon and looked for the best deal possible.  Great product, great price, great gift.
B004G6009U|4.0|Great movie, reminds me of the older Disney movies 20 years ago that were so good!<br />Will watch this one many times!
B0017R5UAA|5.0|best album i bought last year. I could not beleive that any new music could be this good. there are no weak songs, if one sounds weak its in comparison to one of the truly great songs, such as \\"meadowlark\\", \\"your protector\\", \\"white winter hymnal\\" \\"tiger mountain peasant song\\" \\"bllue ridge mountains\\"...  I've got to stop or i'll just name all of the songs on the album.  This album is for any lover of music, whether you're folky or funky or into hard stuff or more cutting edge music, this album is truly groundbreaking. one of the few of my many hundred albums that get a 5 out of 5.    get it as soon as possible!!!
0446677450|1.0|The book is not based on reality. If it was based on reality it would be published by a university press and based on empirical studies. Instead this is one man's opinion intended to sell, not educate. Do yourself a favor and stop shopping / reading books from the self-help section. Check the author's credentials every time. If they are trying to sell you health advice, then they better have a PhD from an Ivy League University, be affiliated with a prestigious hospital, and have years of clinical medical experience. If they tell you, they are a best-selling author, it doesn't mean anything. Popularity has never been a test for accuracy / truth.
B000NQR7NO|5.0|The shipping for this was uber-fast and it arrived in great condition. No scratches on the cd or bumps on the case. And it's an amazing album! There are some really great songs on here like Old Yellow Bricks and Flourescent Adolescent. Great punk/alternative British Indie. I love the sound and the purchase was very good. I definitely reccomend this CD.
B003A9UWJM|5.0|Tubular Bells II is, in my opinion, the best of Oldfield's Tubular Bells. There is little more to be said than all other reviewers have about specifics, so I'll be brief.  Some say that Tubular Bells II is simply a new version of the original Tubular Bells. Definitely both a true and at the same time false statement. The progression of the album is similar, as are a few sounds. Deep down, however, this is a whole new album with a lot more power than the first.  Lastly, is that this album is truly first quality and among the best in the progressive rick genre. It has an immense power to fill you (you know, like good music, where you get into the music so much that you forget about the world). Very complex through its entirety, this album is for those who can appreciate both good music and good engineering.
B003DT19F0|2.0|My daughter loved the first Tinkerbell film and also enjoys the second one (though not as much). The third film was a miss. It moved way too slow. Was way too dialogue heavy and seemed to waste time explaining things to the audience that were reviewed in the previous films. The biggest surprise was the fact that while Vidia's character shows some growth (coping to getting Tinkerbell stuck in the toy house)while Tinkerbell's character seems the same brash character from the previous films. The film simply spent too much time explaining things when it should have been doing things. I'm hoping the next film reverses this trend.
B000026FJ6|5.0|As someone who is in the aerospace industry, I really appreciate Oldfield doing an album like this. It seems as if I describe most of Oldfield's albums as masterpieces. It is not an untrue statement to say most of them are. Songs of Distant Earth is just that. It should also be mentioned that it is very difficult to describe music as beautiful. Somehow, beauty is the word that comes to mind when I think of this album. Outstanding beauty. I think that it is probably due to the recordings of Apollo 8 being played, which make me think of how beautiful the Earth looks from space.    If I could, I would give this album 6 stars. It would be the only time I have ever wished I could.
B001UV4XI8|5.0|Great movie, I've been pleasantly surprised at how close they have kept the movies to the books and part 1 is no exception! Cant' wait for the last half!
0793518326|5.0|Note for note; chord for chord, unmatched in any guitar book. This book even shows the licks for drums and bass. Great book and a must have for all Beatle enthusiasts
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Love it but needs more levels faster and were is the May update. I was looking forward to more angry birds.
B003ZD9DYI|4.0|Buen disco de John Mayer, quizas no a la altura de Continuum pero no por eso deja de tener muy buenas canciones. Quizas es su disco mas pop y donde menos solos de guitarra podemos escuchar pero hay alguna cancion como \\"perfecly lonely\\" que se enganchan desde la primera escucha. Esta edicion tiene ademas un DVD con seis temas y comentarios de John Mayer y luego dos temas en acustico grabados en japon. Por la diferencia de precio con la edicion normal, vale la pena comprar esta.
1586210661|2.0|I am still wrestling with the rating I gave this book. On one hand, I was rather unimpressed with this audiobook. The stories were okay, but most of them just gave me a chuckle or two or, worse, just mild amusement. On the other hand, perhaps it was just my mood, maybe I am not used to reading humor books.<br /><br />But I am getting ahead of myself.<br /><br />In David Sedaris' \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\", Dave Sedaris relates episodes from his past, primarily concerning speech and his stay in France. I won't really say much more as it could destroy the humor from the situations that Sedaris creates in the books (for those that plan on reading). I've also heard that this is not exactly a biography as some of the stories were exaggerated for the humorous effect, but as I didn't expect 100% historical accuracy, I wasn't too concerned.<br /><br />First thing first, the audiobook does not have all the anecdotes that are in the novel form. I checked out both the audiobook and the novel (I was hoping to have time to read the novel for my Book Club, but that wasn't meant to be, so I also got the audiobook), and a quick comparsion showed that several stories particularly from the first section are missing in the audiobook.<br /><br />As for the sections I listened to, I found myself time and again underwhelmed. I would listen and maybe get a mild sensation of amusement. Sometimes, on a rare occasion, I would let loose a small chuckle. Only towards the end did I find myself belly-laughing.<br /><br />A lot of the humor tended to be deprecatory or rather gruesome. A good example of this would be the first anecdote \\"Go Carolina\\", in which a teacher purposely lies to David to get him to reveal his lisp and then laughs in his face. I just didn't get the humor of the episode, to be honest. Even though I know that it was likely hyperbole, I just couldn't get past a teacher acting so callously. Another good example of the disturbing humor is \\"Twelve Moments in the Life of the Artist\\". Most of the \\"moments\\" seemed to be nothing more than drug jokes. While some were admittedly mildly amusing, I never found any of these gut-wrenchingly funny.<br /><br />That doesn't mean the entire book was dry and boring and humorless. There were some times that I did chuckle or laugh heartily. For instance, \\"Nutcracker.com\\" really tickled me with Dave's tales about traveling with a typewriter and his disgust for computers. \\"Jesus Shaves\\" was hilarious in how some students tried to explain Easter in French to a Moroccan student. Other stories I liked were \\"Pledge Allegiance to the Bag\\" and some of the \\"Precious Moments\\" anecdotes.<br /><br />Perhaps it was my mood (because I do tend to like dry humor similar to Sedaris'), as the latter anecdotes sparked more of a reaction in me. Perhaps it was the format (audiobooks can sometimes lose me). Maybe it was the delivery (Sedaris himself read them, but maybe his delivery deadened the \\"jokes\\" for me). Whatever the case, the book just wasn't all that funny to me, and for that reason, I can't give high ratings. If I do end up reading the novel, I'll update this review with my thoughts, if they've changed.<br /><br />Brought to you by:<br />*C.S. Light*than drug jokes.

0375842209|5.0|Oh.  My.  God.  Words fail when it comes to describing this book.  I can't say I wasn't expecting that part of it - I'm a sucker for WWII cry-your-eyes-out kind of books - but the way this book took my breath away was enough to take my breath away a second time.  More than anything else, it's a story about childhood, not a story about battles or mass murder or tragedy, and that's what makes it different from anything else out there.    \\"Put this on the shelf next to The Diary of Anne Frank,\\" I've heard some reviews say.  That's sort of true, as far as one, how good it is, and two, its ability to make you cry until you could be wrung out, but I think they're missing the point in lumping the two together.  I think Anne Frank might have been a little disappointed at how few people seem willing to make the jump beyond her own tragedy into the tragedy of the entire war.  The subtitle, after all, is Diary of a Young Girl, and that's what The Book Thief reads like - a diary.  Only it's Death's diary, about a young girl.  And when you're a young girl, you don't much care if you're German or Dutch or Jewish or Catholic.    That was another thing I liked about the story, beyond the brilliance of the writing or anything else - how it humanized ordinary Germans.  I am disgusted by what the Nazis did as much as the next person is, but not all Germans were Nazis - and many, many Germans did valiant, dangerous things to defend their principles.  The Book Thief throws those things into sharp, heartrending relief.    And I hope I haven't neglected to mention that the writing was beyond, beyond, BEYOND belief.  I mean, Death as a narrator?  Had most authors tried it, it would have come across as unbelievably hokey.  In Markus Zusak's hands, it's a beautiful thing, and I can't imagine the story being told any other way.  There's been a lot of talk of unreliable narrators in the writing world, lately, and in my opinion, this is the real deal.    One of the best books I have read all year; probably one of the best books I have read in my entire life.  (I've probably read thousands of books, so don't take that lightly.)  Just read it!
B0041KKYEM|3.0|Darren Aronofsky made such a bold, provocative debut with \\"Pi\\" back in 1998. But his career has been nothing but overwrought un-realism ever since. \\"Black Swan\\" is an uninspired rehash of Roman Polanski's superb \\"Repulsion\\" (1965), about an apparently schizophrenic, sexually repressed young woman who descends into madness amid paranoid hallucinations and libidinous men. \\"Repulsion\\" is a great film, while \\"Black Swan\\" is overwrought, gimmicky, not the least bit credible, and badly acted -not that it matters considering the superficiality of the exercise. It's also a ballet movie with hardly any ballet in it. Natalie Portman is in great shape but looks absurdly strained performing the simplest of movements.<br /><br />Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) is an emotionally disturbed young ballerina who seems to be living out the ambitions of her domineering mother (Barbara Hershey). Nevertheless, she is the hardest-working ballerina in her company, technically perfect, but lacking a certain passion. She dreams of dancing the Swan Queen in \\"Swan Lake\\", and, to her surprise and everyone else's, the company's choreographer Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) gives her the part. Mr. Leroy is confident in Nina's ability to play the White Swan but is concerned that she lacks the sexual energy and transcendence to play the Black Swan. The problem preoccupies Nina as well, and the stress erodes her grasp on reality and brings on increasingly violent psychotic episodes.<br /><br />Natalie Portman does not have the acting chops for this role. She does not know how to convey emotion except by emoting. She does the entire film with furrowed brow. A better actress could have made Nina's torment believable but not her situation. It's simply not credible that this weak, flagrantly unstable person would possess the single-minded drive of a professional ballet dancer, much less that anyone would give her the lead in a production. She looks like she's going to have an anxiety attack in every scene. Mila Kunis, on the other hand, is charismatic as rival ballerina Lily, who seems to be genuinely trying to be friendly and helpful to Nina despite the latter's paranoia. Kunis' sassy, lewd and tattooed temptress screams out for more screen time than she gets.<br /><br />Instead, we get crotch shots, hallucinations, CGI that allows Nina to sprout feathers, and very little ballet. On the bright side, \\"Black Swan\\" gets better as it goes along, because the story grows into Natalie Portman's panicked performance. By the final act, Nina has reason to break down under the stresses of her paranoia, hallucinations, and determination to become the Black Swan. The film is saved by good pacing, a suspenseful final act, and a climactic ending. But one lesson that filmmakers should find in \\"Black Swan\\" is that there is little point in setting a movie in a ballet company if there isn't going to be ballet dancing in it. Another is that a character's personality has to suit her role. And don't expect untalented actresses to be able to carry a dramatic film for an hour and 50 minutes.the other hand, is charismatic as rival ballerina Lily, who seems to be genuinely trying to be friendly and helpful to Nina despite the latter's paranoia.

B0042RUMH8|2.0|There is no question that Jennifer Lopez has started to be everywhere again, but it isn't with her music lately. It has been with her surprising return to the spotlight, not as a singer, but as a judge. Stepping into the shadows as a judge on American Idol has re-invigorated her spirit, and her feeling as a mentor to so many wannabe singers. While she has had that as a new spotlight, she just hasn't shown that lately musically with her album Love? It was originally slated to be released last year, but with label shifts, and poor songs, the question is does Jennifer Lopez have it musically anymore. Not really, and she tries too hard to show that Love? isn't really what it is suppose to be.<br /><br />Love? Jennifer Lopez's latest album feels like a waste on the ears musically, and a waste of time soulfully. After the dissapointments of her work on Love? back in 2009, and with being dropped from Sony after the sinking feelings of Louboutons and Fresh Out The Oven which miserably failed, she moved to Island Def Jam to finish the album. Unfortunately, she tries too hard to bring in the dance rhythms into her album, yet misses the mark strongly into her songs. The track feel like wastes of time from the singles, On The Floor, to Hypnotico, to her latest song I'm Into You. Jennifer tries to go to the same mark, yet she doesn't spread her wings strong enough to step out of that range. It really is sad, because she has had that voice with the Latin rhythm, but tries too hard to show it, and the songs unfortunately have wasted in tune with it. I really felt bored with it almost halfway during the album, feeling like I've hard the exact same thing, and not anything worth more of the effort. It didn't feel like she gave it her all here. Her feeling trying to score again in music just didn't strike the strongest chords, and yet she could've brought more into walking into her shoes, not just a mother with twins, but also with more might than just the same thing.<br /><br />All in all, Jennifer should just try and focus on American Idol right now, that is where her money is right now, and musically she needs to hang up her pipes. Love? was not honestly worth the wait, even for die hard Jennifer Lopez fans. She just put too many eggs into one basket on the album, and the songs just didn't show either. This is not a album I absolutely recommend at all, and if you're new to Jennifer Lopez's music because of her work on American Idol, I really suggest you go to her Sony works like On The 6 or even Rebirth instead. This is not a must buy, and not even close to a comeback for Jennifer Lopez!

B004LFO0ME|3.0|Wiz Khalifa's Rolling Papers is a good album that's catchy and fun to listen to. It's great to listen to in the car because it keeps your energy high, with lyrics that are fun and easy to sing along to. I learned about him from his smash hit, \\"Black and Yellow.\\" It's a great track, but I was surprised to see that the album has a lot of other catchy tunes, like \\"On My Level\\" and \\"Pack Your S***.\\"     The downsides to me are one, that too many songs are about smoking pot. It just feels a little old to constantly hear about it. We get it, you like smoking it. Also, I don't think there's a lot of depth to his lyrics, it's mostly just about partying and getting high. It isn't an album that's going to break new ground in this music genre. But it's fun to listen to it.

B003E6K1VK|4.0|First and foremost, I can say that for my purposes this device works perfectly, and I have no complaints whatsoever about quality -- what is not a common occurrence. However this is at large extent because I needed exactly this kind of device -- a USB DAC with a headphones amplifier that I can connect to my computer to drive [[ASIN:B000UVGI6O Audio-Technica ATH-M50 Studio Monitor Headphones]] (and deal with their low impedance), or amplified speakers, without having to deal with noise, distortion or weirdness of onboard audio adapter. The device works as advertised -- reproduces sound in a way that I can't find any flaws with either my ears or the minimal amount of measurements that I have performed. If the user wishes, it adds slightly more bass (to compensate for headphones' frequency response -- though ATH-M50 don't seem to need any). It has manual volume control with 60 steps, 50 being unity gain (output equal to the input).    Those very things may be exactly the opposite of someone else's expectations -- for high-impedance headphones with audio source that only provides analog output (or audio source that can drive low-impedance headphones on its own), this device is a $100 equivalent of a straight piece of wire. I don't have an iPod/iPhone, so I can't evaluate what this amplifier adds or does not add when connected to it, or what happens with lower impedance headphones (ATH-M50 is 38 Ohms), but I would not be surprised if the answer is \\"nothing\\". If you have something with analog output that does not strain itself trying to drive your headphones, you probably won't like this device (as an amplifier) at all.    On the other hand, if you have a laptop with headphones jack that mostly produces noise and distortion, you will benefit from this more than I did -- this device has a high-quality DAC, you will have the benefit of having all the noise from other components remaining far away from analog audio path, and the amplifier is most likely much better than whatever is built into the laptop. That is -- if you connect it to a USB port so it will replace the existing audio adapter completely. Connecting it to a USB-capable computer in the \\"amplifier only\\" mode would be a waste of time because it will amplify already distorted signal. It will still help if computer couldn't drive the headphones at any usable level or causes more distortion with low-impedance headphones compared to high-impedance amplifier or allows you to use a separate un-amplified line output to connect the amplifier, but if you have USB port, it makes no sense, DAC in this device is certainly better at producing analog signal than anything in your computer, and even if by any chance it's the same, it still operates in a less noisy environment.    I have never used it with a CD player, but I guess, it will work well as an amplifier -- if you need one to drive your headphones. It will not turn 16-bit 44100Hz of a CD into something else, just like it won't turn 64Kbps MP3 into CD-quality sound, and it will not make your headphones nearly burst your eardrums all the while preserving the sound perfectly. It certainly won't fix flaws of the recording itself, especially those that you can notice with nice headphones (I count ATH-M50 as \\"nice\\"). I realize that some \\"audiophiles\\" can literally pay $100 for a straight piece of wire that does nothing, and/or spend hours discussing what that straight piece of wire supposedly does and how it compares to other straight pieces of wire, but at very least I am compelled to say that this amplifier will be exactly the same thing if used where it is not needed.    Another limitation that may be important for some, is lack of the recording input. Usually USB audio adapters come with both DAC for output and ADC for input. Quality of ADC often being more important than DAC because it's used to record audio for various kinds of processing, and processing loses precision. This one is output-only -- if you use computer for recording, you will need something else for this purpose (USB microphone, dedicated ADC, line input on existing audio adapter, assuming that quality is sufficient...) Not being a musician or singer, I don't care, my USB microphone is sufficient for those rare situations when the sound of my voice is supposed to appear somewhere in a digital form.    Now, to my own complaints. There are two:    1. High-gloss plastic front panel. Should be very easy to scratch. Ships with soft (and usually already scratched) transparent plastic sheet on it, that the user is supposed to replace with a much more pleasant-looking and durable sheet that comes with device. I have failed miserably to perform this procedure despite having no problems doing exactly the same on other devices. No idea why -- maybe there was just too much dust in the air -- but the only available sheet was gone. I ended up buying third-party protective sheet. Why front panel is like this in the first place, is a mystery for me -- it's not a touchscreen, the rest of the device is in a very durable case, there is a rubber-like cover that covers everything except for this shiny front surface -- despite the fact that only a small fraction of it is used to display anything.    2. No useful documentation. What was not a big deal for all situations except one -- when I have discovered that volume control from computer does not work. DAC is correctly recognized by ALSA drivers (I run Linux), volume control shows up just like on all other audio adapters, however it does absolutely nothing -- volume stays at whatever level is set on the device with +/- buttons. To solve this mystery, I looked at the specifications and found that USB DAC part of the device uses two chips -- TI PCM2706 and Wolfson WM8740. Not having used those two before, but knowing that TI chip is widely supported without any problems, I went to TI web site and got its datasheet. That immediately explained what was going on. PCM2706 is a full USB DAC -- it provides USB interface, analog output and everything in between. Except, FIIO only uses it as a USB interface, and actual DAC is Wolfson -- it's more precise (less noise and harmonic distortion), what is one of the reasons why this device is expensive.    TI chip has analog output and two digital output interfaces, however only digital output from TI chip is connected anywhere, and trying to control volume of unused analog output is pointless. Once I knew what to look for, I have found that indeed E7 is recognized as a device with two outputs -- digital and analog. Switching to the digital device solved the problem, ALSA recognized that it has to apply gain by itself (in software) to change the volume.    I realize that manufacturer expects most users to be completely unaware of those options, especially when amplifier itself has its own volume buttons and display. I don't even know how it all looks under Windows or OSX -- maybe they do everything in software even if better analog controls are available. But it would be nice if there was something mentioned about it in the manual -- just for those unfortunate who want to have all controls work perfectly but can't read circuit diagrams or don't know what kind of interface has a signal named \\"LRCK\\". Something like:    \\"Though all outputs of this device are analog, software configuration, if any, should treat this device as digital stereo output (usually marked as \\"S/PDIF\\" or \\"IEC958\\" ), not analog audio output, because digital audio is used internally between USB adapter and DAC\\".    It's not even important that internal interface is I2S, not S/PDIF itself, the important part is that anything controlling S/PDIF will do the right thing but controlling analog output (like in other USB-connected DACs) will not.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|My only complaint about this book is that it had to end.  If the other 9 books are this compelling, then this will indeed be an epic series.

We found the results a bit different than we had expected, but more accurate than our own guesses.  Each love language chapter includes practical steps to help you learn to speak your spouses love language which I found very helpful.

It is, in other words, a quintessential Dan Brown novel.  If you haven't enjoyed other DB novels, LS won't convert you.  If you have enjoyed other DB novels, LS will feel very familiar.  And welcome enough, though the DB formula is getting a bit tired.  As for those reviewers who whinge about inaccuracy in DB novels, they are taking what, to any sane person, are little more than in-flight rags way too seriously.  LS, like the other Robert Langdon novels, is mind candy with only the faintest trace of mind.  Read these novels for a bit of entertainment and to pass the time -- nothing more.  By that standard, LS is good as the others.
B003UESJH4|5.0|Like everyone else, I was keen to see if this movie matched the hype. At the outset, I found I had to adjust my expectations - so many Oscar winners are big epic-type movies like Titanic and this is not that. On one level, it's a movie with a small scope - just three people feature in 80% of it - Colin Firth as the future King, Helena Bonham Carter as his wife, and Geoffrey Rush as Lionel his speech therapist. Of course these are three actors that can pull off that kind of focus, and they do. They are all riveting. And the movie is of course set right in the crux of history, on the cusp England going to war, so as it moves on, it does take on certain epic traits. In the end, though, I think it's more than anything a very personal story of the relationship between two men, and then how that relationship does ultimately impact history. It's a quiet, slowly paced movie most of the time. But once you settle into that, it really is worth it.
B004RC8NUQ|5.0|Ashton Kutcher is known for his many starring roles in several Hollywood romantic comedies and \\"No Strings Attached\\" is his latest. Co-starring with Natalie Portman, the film deals with the new 2000's slogan \\"friends with benefits\\" where two people share only one thing in common with each other: a great sexual relationship and that is all. The movie tackles this subject brilliantly, but the real question is can these same two people keep their relationship as it is without actually falling in love?<br /><br /> For the men Portman has never looked more beautiful and for women and gay men Ashton Kutcher has never looked sexier (except in his film \\"Spread\\"), so viewers will love the film solely because of the leads with their charming chemistry. Kevin Kline (after a long absence from movies) has a supporting role playing Ashon's dad.<br /><br /> The movie (which cost Paramount $25,000,000 to make) was a boxoffice hit earning over $144,000,000 at the box office making \\"No Strings Attached\\" one of Ashton Kutcher's biggest films.<br /><br /> The DVD and Blue-ray editions have a slew of bonuses including commentary with director Ivan Reitman; the featurettes \\"Sex Friends: Getting Together\\", \\"Inside The Sassy Halls of Secret High\\", \\"Modern Love: The Do's and Don'ts\\"; and deleted scenes.
B004A8ZWSS|3.0|What an odd movie. It seemed to me like it just couldn't decide what genre to be - comedy, heist, or action-thriller. It seemed to be setting us up for the second at the beginning, then would occasionally lapse into one of the other two, but then never really committed. Depp seemed to be clowning it up at times, ala Pirates of the Caribbean, but nothing previously prepared me for that, so it always felt out of context. Angelina is gorgeous, and is supposed to be a little other-wordly in this, but she was so much so that I couldn't really figure her part out. And the two really didn't seem to have much chemistry at all, which surprised me. That would have been OK if it was a heist type movie that kept you guessing until the end, but I had guessed the end pretty early on, and so had my husband. So it just didn't work overall.<br /><br />The only thing that saved it somewhat is that Depp and Jolie are both so gorgeous, even in a bad movie. And the Paris/Venice settings were also gorgeous, so there was plenty to look at:-)

Also, being the age I am I can understand why I missed it growing up; I'm sure it was deemed quite racy and provocative in its day ... probably exactly the kind of book my teachers and parents would have been horrified to find me reading. Today, though, it's quite mild and, in fact, almost quaint.<br /><br />Now, back to Jean Brodie. I liked her at first. She seemed like an ultra-strong, super-liberated woman, especially for her time. However, as the story unfolded I started to find her a bit weird, scary, controlling ... and, toward the end, even pathetic. I especially disliked how this seemingly uber-modern woman got caught up in a petty competition with two sisters over who would have the \\"privilege\\" of essentially waiting hand and foot on a local bachelor, whom she didn't even seem to like all that well.<br /><br />In the end she seemed like a bitter woman to me, who never was really able to get what she wanted out of life, but also never able to get past those problems either. Initially I admired her attempts to teach \\"her girls\\" to think for themselves and live outside the box, but I ended up questioning her motives. I don't think she was ever able to enjoy her \\"prime\\" because she always seemed to be wanting things that she couldn't get or have.<br /><br />I frankly thought the story was depressing but, again, beautifully told, and I'm glad to have finally read it.

There are no LONG boring scenes with no dialogues in this show and the writers are not afraid to kill off characters in order to move the story forward. That's always refreshing!

In a blink we put together the thoughts of racism, civil rights, science, patients rights, genetics...It is an engrossing story because you want to know what happens next, it is related in a first person narration, but the author makes you believe that you are the one discovering things with her. It is not  apolitical statement or any statement of sort other than to give recognition to a woman who has changed the face of science for many years and will continue to do so for a very long time!
B004HW7JMO|5.0|I ended up liking this prequel even more than the first season. Although, historically, it looks more like the later empire (Caligula's times), I found the story entertaining and we had no problem with the violence or the sexual content (my boyfriend is a cop and he said he sees worst at work). The end of the season was a pleasant surprise to me (considering how the first season ended). I don't want to spoil it for those who have not seen it. It's a good show that gives a good background for Spartacus Blood and Sand. Dustin Clare was just gorgeous and he did a fantastic job.
B00006DEF9|5.0|Shot in Technicolor this is one of Hollywood epic movies that captured the hearts and imaginations of viewers then and now. The acting is so-so but the singing and dancind are superb, Debbie Reynolds is fabulous and I fell in love with Gene Kelly. My kids love it and they sing the songs all the time. it makes me think that movies need not be violent or sexual to enthrall an audience, they just need to entertain!!!
B004GJYROG|4.0|Okay, what is not to like when you have Buggs being Buggs?  The movie is a great family film that should amuse and entertain any child or child at heart adult.  The acting is fine and the storyline is good for what they wanted. A must see for any looney tune fan.
B0041KKYCY|5.0|This is a very intense movie.  The build-up to the bad deed is incredible. You know it's going to happen, and everytime you think it's going to, it doesn't.  And then when it does . . . it's slow and drawn out.  The actual sex part is quite minimal, however. I know it's rape, and you can see what a horrible ordeal it was for her, but for the viewer is goes fairly quick.  What is slow is how they play mind games with her leading up to it.  I have absolutely no sympathy for the rapists. In fact, they beg her for mercy, and you wonder how any woman in her shoes could give it.  No, this is a horror movie folks.  There's no monsters or the devil, but it's definately a horror movie. What she does to those guys, well, it's very intense.  And her revenge takes a lot longer than the rape did.  Whoa. You gotta see it to believe it. I jumped out of my chair three times!    Now there are a lot of unanswered questions.  How did she survive in the woods for more than a month without ever getting caught?  Where did she get the new car when they torched hers?  Hell, she escaped the rape 100% naked. Where did she get 2 sets of new clothes?  Well, I guess we'll never know.    All in all, this is a 5-star movie.  As the box says, \\"If you can handle it, watch it!\\"    Sin
B004QPOVF0|5.0|I am looking forward to this big time but am a little disappointed they always leave out certain songs. I was kinda hopin' they'd finally do something with 'Big Gun' and 'Who Made Who'. These are awesome songs but they never use them in any live dvd packages. I know it's because they'd have to pay the film companies some royalties but who cares, a few dollars here and there shouldn't be a big deal, especially with how well their stuff sells. Next time guys. You gotta loosen the purse strings and use these songs cos they're awesome songs.
0452295548|3.0|I wanted to like this book, but I found the writing very uneven - it's part memoir, part New Age self-help manual with a little bit of junior high school science thrown in, and it doesn't really hit the mark on any of them.    The detailed description of Dr. Taylor's experience of the stroke - her feelings and disjointed thought processes throughout - was the most compelling section for me. Unfortunately, that kind of attention to detail is lacking in her account of the extended recovery process, which basically amounts to \\"I couldn't do X, so I kept trying. And then I slept a lot. And then I tried some more.\\" We don't get much of a sense of the challenges or frustrations involved in her therapy; rather, the focus is on length of time - how long she had to sleep to recover her energy, and how long it took her to recover words, visual integration, motor coordination and ultimately, the rest of her faculties.    The neuroanatomy of brain function and stroke is presented in a very simplistic way in the earlier chapters, but there is a complete lack of scientific content in the latter half of the book, which expounds on the author's feelings of Nirvana and being \\"one with the universe\\" due to the dominance of her not-so-damaged right hemisphere. We're given a blurry reproduction or two of Dr. Taylor's diagnostic brain scans right after the stroke, but we don't get to see the progression of her recovery charted in subsequent scans, nor do we get even a brief contrast study of a patient with right-hemispheric damage and how that changes stroke symptoms, treatment and prognosis.    This might be excusable were it not for the author's tendency to espouse unproven \\"universal truths\\" such as sending out \\"good vibrations\\" based primarily on her subjective experiences. Dr. Taylor's advice to \\"Step to the right\\" (in neurological terms, that is) to achieve true happiness would be a lot more compelling if I could see some rigorous science behind it instead of a subjective personalaccount of magically finding bliss after a devastating neurological event.    For those interested in neuroplasticity, I suggest [[ASIN:0143113100 The Brain That Changes Itself: Stories of Personal Triumph from the Frontiers of Brain Science (James H. Silberman Books)]] by Norman Doidge, who does a much better job of integrating science with medical anecdote.
0743487486|5.0|As a Marriage and Family Therapy graduate student, I read Unconditional Parenting on a recommendation from a professor.  While admittedly, I am not yet a parent (and understand how some will disregard my opinion due to this), part of me is happy that I read this book before having children.  I am happy because after reading Kohn's piece, I feel more equipped to be a parent who is respectful, supportive, assumes the best in children, and nurtures learning.    In Unconditional Parenting, Kohn thoroughly describes the problematic-nature of popular, control-based parenting styles that use rewards and punishment to obtain child obedience.  Using research, Kohn demonstrates that \\"doing to\\" parenting is not only counter-productive in some instances, yet also can hinder moral development, teach children to use power to get what they want, and create obsessive compliance.  Instead of this conditional approach, Kohn proposes a \\"being with\\" style that includes:   * Reconsidering your requests- problem may be in what you are asking your child to do  * Putting the relationship first- creates comfort to talk and trust  * Loving unconditionally- show children they do not have to earn parent's love  * Asking how things seem from child's point of view?  * Being authentic- apologize, do not act infallible  * Talking less, asking more  * Attributing to children the best possible motive consistent with the facts  * Trying to say \\"yes\\" when possible  * Being flexible  * Letting kids decide unless there is a compelling otherwise- give them the first word because they do not have the last word    Easy to do? Absolutely not. Beneficial? It seems so.
B002OSXDAU|1.0|Great book - $21 is wrong...  I purchased the kindle so I could get books around $9...  I'll read the 'real' book instead of downloading this off Amazon...
037582913X|5.0|I loved this book as a child; my 10-year-old loved this book; now my toddler is a fan.  Book is great for Sesame Street fans but is also a great book on its own merits.
0812548094|1.0|I hated the first book. However, I was promised the second book was much better. I was lied to. The subpoena's are currently being served.    All bad jokes aside, The story was a bit better. There were moments of the book I really enjoyed. Yet there were also points in the story that made me feel like putting my head in an oven.  The main character's slow transformation into a giant baby kicks into high gear in this book. His feigned respect for other people's feelings and beliefs that he had in the first book is thrown right out the window in the sequel. Richard spends most of the book threatening to kill innocent people while claiming he was in the right. The ending of the book seemed improvised and rushed to say the least. There were several segments of the plot that weren't expanded on nor explained. Terry Goodkind seemed set on keeping the book under the 1000 page mark.    Please. Don't read this book without having first put a dunce cap over your head.

B004NCLKJG|4.0|The Met has had an amazing legacy of Wagner, with over 3500 performances dominating even Bayreuth with its 2500 or so performances.  One of the great things about the Met is that so many performances from the past can be heard today as a result of broadcasts going back 80 years now.  Although the \\"golden age\\" of Wagner at the Met may have been in 1930s/40s, there was still some great singing to be heard later as shown by this recording.  It is great to hear Nilsson with Vickers, but for me a real treat was hearing (the American) Thomas Stewart as Wotan who sang strongly and with good dramatic sense - a very human god.  The sound is quite good on the recording, with most of the voices (with the exception of the Valkyries in the beginning of Act III) captured quite clearly and in good balance with the orchestra.  The orchestra sound/performance is not as good as (say) the live Bohm performance from Bayreuth a few years earlier, but the singing really is excellent.<br /><br />It is good to finally have this on record and at a reasonable price.  It could be a fine stand-alone recording of the opera, though if pressed, I would suggest the London recording with Nilsson/Vickers recording under Leinsdorf that comes with great sound, a reasonable price, and a (on the disk) libretto.<br /><br />This may not be the very best Walkure (too many choices!) but it is an excellent one.  Let's be glad Sony is releasing some of these great performances!

B003BVFZ4Q|5.0|I have just finished your book 'On Writing'. As I was reading I thought that I might write to you but with no great certainty. Then I read 'On Living: A Postscript' your final chapter and immediately picked-up my unmargined, Ruled Narrow Faint, A4 writing pad. I used the blue biro which had recently written the outline for my first novel in a notebook. It was written whilst sat at an upstairs window seat in McDonalds, overlooking the medieval town-hall square in the city of Chester, England.<br /><br />I'd like to say that you inspired me but that would not be true. I have long dwelled on that magical storyline that would get me started on writing my first novel but have never pinned one down. Until now. Everything is coming together.<br /><br />It happened cycling to Chester, some sixteen miles, for the first time in my life. It is something I vowed to do this summer. I thought I could cycle there and get the train back. I cycled there and back. I cycled there and back because I was writing a novel that got me there and helped me back. A novel which includes little 'pictures' of my very recent past and can include whatever I want. Unlike other ideas I put it down (the notebook) and carried on with my life so that the adrenaline rush would be dissipated by the time I was ready to sit down and write. And I finished your book.<br /><br />You describe, in your final chapter, a near fatal road accident you had and I'm thinking: 'go on, have a head injury which changes your personality and affects your writing skills' but no, my life was not going to be replicated by Stephen King. But I recognised the will to win. The individual's will to win. So the first burning question I have is: how are you, do you still need meds?<br /><br />I have never read any other book of yours. I have enjoyed some films of your stories especially the wonderful 'Shawshank Redemption.' I read 'On Writing' on my Kindle and thought I should try one of your books but I'm afraid the Look Inside feature of amazon UK put me off. I find your prose style rather flat. So my final question is about writing for the pleasure of the prose we produce. I sense that you are addicted to the unfolding puzzle nature of a story: could you write a book with me as your IR? [that's Ideal Reader for those who have not yet read On Writing]. You could be my IR when I finally sit down with the blinds down, the door closed and write my novel. I was thinking of your advice during my epiphany on that cycle journey.<br /><br />But you can forget writing it in three months though! I intend the first chapter to be carved from stone with a bread knife. You never mentioned Ishmael's requirements for writing: 'Time, Strength, Cash and Patience!'  Patience.<br /><br />Yours, Not passive and no adverbs. BR.find your prose style rather flat. So my final question is about writing for the pleasure of the prose we produce.

B0041KKYEM|4.0|I think this movie is one of the strangest I've ever seen, however, it is a pretty good movie.  I allows the audience to really think about what is happening and discover their own versions of the movie. Everyone should at least give it a try.

I have purchased this cable multiple times, every one of them arrives quickly and works perfectly.    I do not have a 3D tv to verify if this supports 3D.
0446693804|5.0|I meant read this book for ages but because people told me that it was terribly sad I held off. My advice to you - don't. This book is about more than just a young teenage boy as he grows up. This book is about unfailing love and sacrifice. Whether you know the ending - which I did beforehand - or not. It is a book that is worth your time to read. It is the kind of book that gives you hope even while you're crying your eyes out.<br /><br />LAndon Carter is your normal 17 year old. He's a senior in high school, he just wants to fit in and have fun but then he meets Jamie Sullivan and gets begrudgingly dragged into her life. Jamie Sullivan is NOT the type of girl you hang out with if you want to have fun and fit in. Shee's quirky, bible-lugging, and just plain strange. But Landon cannot have foreseen the consequences of this new relationship. His resentfulness at her strange intrusion in his life soon changes to something else, however, as he realizes that she has a sincerity that he's never known before.<br /><br />This is not just a love story. It is a story about a boy who becomes a man, a family and community that is drawn closer through hardship, and a young girl whose life is about to change forever. I highly recommend this book. If you read just one book by Nicholas Sparks, make this the one. You will not be disappointed, and your heart will be full and better because of it. Your tissue box too, will be just a little emptier.
B004GJDQT8|4.0|This is a must have app if you frequently shop on Amazon. It runs really smooth on my evo, makes shopping on amazon a breeze. Much easier to use than a mobile web browser to view the web page on your phone. I use it frequently when I am out shopping and want to check prices and reviews. Amazon is almost always cheaper than local stores, so its an easy way to save money.    Ordering items through the app is very easy. I have completed the process several times and had no errors or order problems.     The one problem I have with this app is the bar code scanner. I can almost never get bar code scanners to work and this app is no different. I often feel like an idiot standing in a store trying to get this app to read a bar code. On the flip side, the app almost always finds the item I am looking for when I search via keyword search or texting a picture.
B0000029DD|4.0|I HATED JEFF Buckley. Well, at least I did when his first single, \\"Last Goodbye,\\" came out while I was rocking my face off to sounds from Pearl Jam, the Smashing Pumpkins, Sound Garden, and Stone Temple Pilots. However, as the mind matures, so does the openness to other forms of art and music, and after fifteen years I see him as one of the most influential singer/songwriters in contemporary popular music. Jeff Buckley is an eclectic, guitar playing singer from the 1990's, whose only major studio album, Grace (1994), is a highly acclaimed success by critics and musicians from a wide variety of genres.    The original version of Grace has ten tracks on it that range from hard rock songs like \\"Eternal Life\\" to melodic acoustic anthems such as \\"Love, Should've Come Over.\\" Buckley also covers three songs on the album: \\"Lilac Wine\\"; a beautiful, mellow, jazzy tune that moves from a dark, dissident melody to a falsetto-like triumph; \\"Corpus Christi Carol\\" that exemplifies Buckley's vocal ability and range, but is completely alien from the other tracks on the album; and, the gem of all is \\"Hallelujah,\\"  which was originally written by poet/songwriter Leonard Cohen, but which Buckley makes the ballad his own by taking out the last two verses of Cohen's original and sings three alternate verses that make the song provocative and sexy, yet sad. An example of Buckley's sensuality is in the forth verse:     well there was a time when you let me know   what's really going on below   but now you never show that to me do you   but remember when I moved in you   and the holy dove was moving too   and every breath we drew was hallelujah      Besides the covers, Buckley's original sound is widely varied but extremely ahead of the times - even by today's standards. His melodies, vocal sound, guitar work, and arrangements are unique, but not too eclectic to cause distaste to the listener. I would highly recommend anybody to buy this album. It may take some time for you to fallin love with it. It did for me. But I am certain that some measure of Jeff Buckley's Grace will touch one's heart.       It's a shame that Buckley can no longer make music due to his untimely death by drowning in the Mississippi River in 1997; however, the man has left us with something legendary--a masterpiece that may be found to be \\"all over the place\\" when listened to the first few times, but like that of age, your mind, heart, and soul will be moved by at least one aspect of this exceptional artist--Jeff Buckley.
B004A8ZWSS|5.0|Who is the actor who's only appearance is in the last 2 minutes of the film?  He looks like Maurice Benard (Sonny Corinthos from General Hospital) Help - it's driving me crazy! I can't find his name/character anywhere in the extended credits.
0307592839|2.0|I'd read one Jennifer Egan book before, The Keep.  I liked the idea of The Keep, although I thought there was a lot more that should have been done with it.  When I saw all the praise for Goon Squad, I decided to give Ms Egan another read.    I had a hard time connecting with Goon Squad.  The vignettes interrelated by characters and skipping around in time took some getting used to, but that was ok - keeps the reader alert, if nothing else.  I chalked up my difficulty in connecting to the stories to the fact that I have little connection to the music world, as opposed to reading The Keep where my love of travel and history made for an easy connection.  Many reviewers here, though, who are much more connected to the industry report similar difficulties, so it must be something else.    Goon Squad is a spotty read.  A few of the chapters are really well-written, others make you wonder why Ms Egan bothered (the Powerpoint chapter near the end comes immediately to mind, but it's not the only one).  One of the nice parts of reading this was memories of my first date with my wife nearly 20 years ago - we went to see a cousin's (miserable) band.  There are many connections to that memory in this story - a band that plays painful-to-listen-to music, people who fall of the face of the earth (I wonder what that cousin is up to these days), hopefully a turn-around story...    The walk down memory lane aside, Goon Squad didn't do much for me.  The hit-and-miss nature of the story telling made it a tough one to pick back up after setting it down.

B004HO6HWK|3.0|I like Jason Stratham and enjoy his Martial Arts expertise and \\"tough guy\\" demeanor, but Charles Bronson was Arthur Bishop and this remake does not honor the original.  In Bronson's performance, we got to see his weaknessess.  His need for a prostitute to role play having feelings for him, his bout with anxiety at the zoo, his need for some companionship, which resulted in his taking on an apprentice despite knowing the drawbacks in his choice.  His explanation of what was going on in the dojo when the Instructor was illegally struck in a match (played by Tak Kubota, I think) and nearly killed his opponent.  \\"He is a Killer who doesn't Kill\\" explains Bishop/Bronson; which is the real meaning of the story.  What drives a person to become a professional killer of others?  The opening scene where Bishop/Bronson takes out his target, hiding in a cheesy apartment is VASTLY more entertaining than the new version where Stratham drowns his victim in a pool.  The Action was ok, the ending was better than I expected but not as good as the original, I'm glad I saw it in the theater.  Considering the cast, it should have been much better.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|I'll admit that when I started the Fever series, I wasn't expecting it to be so addictive.<br />Shadow Fever is exactly what I'd needed after reading the other 4 Fever books. When I began reading, each chapter ended with a \\"FINALLY!\\" And each chapter began with \\"Ohhh this is so good!\\". My husband thought I was going crazy when I would periodically laugh out loud, or sigh with frustration. And I admit that I now suffer some Serious character obsession with Jericho Barrons, Danny MEGA, and Christian MacKeltar (thanks to the MacKeltar series).<br />The book ended with plenty of cliffhangers for a (new/different?) series, or at least a continuation of the Fever series. Which, how the Fever series sprang from the MacKeltar series, I hope a new series arises from this, because seriously- DON'T LEAVE ME HANGING!<br /><br />I suggest if you're reading these reviews, and happen to read mine, that you'll do what I say and READ THE SERIES! Even if you've already read books 1-4 and found 4 lacking (for some reason I can't comprehend), buy this 5th book. It won't disappoint. Promise!

B004GHYCKW|4.0|The first four songs are perfect, evoking a mysterious island at the edge of 'goddam' Europe' that has been transformed through the ages by damp nature, corrupt politics and war. It's all very romantic, and gothic, naturally. Only what do the following death and battlefield hymns signify? Has the political become personal again or is it all ethereal? What carries you to the end is a rush of unexpected melodies and gorgeous soundscapes of an otherworldly past.

Wes Borland's AWESOME COOL SO COOL make up and gnarly blacked out contacts really add to their sound and creative stylings.    LOL!    Sam Rivers really brings the bass flow on every song!

However babies may come into the world - they constantly fight for our love and affection.    Babies is a documentary style movie that follows the lives of four babies all over the world from the pregnancy to when they're old enough to go to pre-school. It is very educational and moving, some parts will have you saying \\"A[...]\\" and others will make you say \\"Did that just happen?\\"    By the end of the movie, it should have succeeded in poking at your curiosity about how other cultures raise babies. Thumbs up to the director for ending it before they got to that annoying toddler stage.
B000KJT8IG|1.0|I love this movie.  I sat down to watch my old DVD 4:3 version and decided it wasn't good enough for my HDTV.  I wanted a widescreen HD version.  I found this Blu-ray version on Amazon and placed my order.  My two complaints: video quality and \\"widescreen\\".  The video quality is slightly better than my DVD at best.  The \\"widescreen\\" was the bigger problem.  I assumed this would be a re-release of the original theatrical widescreen version - it isn't.  They have actually cropped the top and bottom off of the 4:3 DVD version to make it pseudo-widescreen.  My Blu-ray now has less of the original movie than the 4:3 version has - it has been cropped twice.  Don't waste your money on this - keep watching the DVD version.

All our favorites are here and considering the circumstances...no guarantees they will all still be there when all is said and done.  Very dark and serious as it well should be.  A little more story and just a little less action than some of our other favorite HP Films but watch with the understanding that this is only the lead in.... I can't wait for PT 2!!
B004LWZW24|3.0|The movie is not great but it's not bad either. A couple, Josh and Renai, move into the old house they just bought, with their two young sons, Dalton and Foster, and baby daughter. Weird things begin to happen, the older son Duncan falls and slips into a coma, doctors indicate that there is no brain damage and the coma cannot be explained. The mother starts to see and hear things and persuades her husband that they need to leave this house. They move into another house but it's not really explained if they put this one up for sale, or how much time has gone by, or if the new house is theirs or if they have moved in with Josh's mother.<br /><br />But Mom still sees and hears things and her mother-in-law, played by Barbara Hershey, does as well. She connects them to Elise, her paranormal investigator friend who arrives with her two investigators, Specs and Tucker, who are very funny.<br /><br />Patrick Wilson is very good ok as the husband whose son Duncan is haunted and Lin Shaye is fantastic as the psychic. Rose Byrne plays the mother and Ty Simpkins the haunted son.<br /><br />Suspenseful but not gory, good tension and atmosphere, it was worth seeing but not one that is worth watching again. I didn't like the ending at all though.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|\\"A Clash of Kings\\" is the second book in the \\"Song of Ice and Fire series.  I thought this installment was a bit \\"scattered\\" in that it included major travel for every storyline, which made it a bit hard for me to keep up with where everyone was at, how armies were trying to gain the upper hand, etc.  I recommend readers get acquainted with the maps so you can visualize the action.  Unfortunately, the Kindle map is a little hard to read, and it doesn't zoom.<br /><br />Martin does an excellent job in creating some despicable characters, while at the same time building up others like Tyrion who develops a sense of honor when it suits his purposes. I like how the point of view changes throughout the book so you can more deeply understand the major characters.  There are a few times when this gets frustrating as the suspense builds on a story line, and then Martin switches to a different character and a different story line.<br /><br />One of the things I like about this book and the series is that it doesn't overly rely on magic.  There is some magic use, but it is mysterious with only a few people that have any special powers.  The majority of the story relies on physical prowess with weapons, the use of military tactics, and political intrigue to manipulate events and outcomes.  I enjoy watching all of these things come together as the kings clash and fight over the seven kingdoms.<br /><br />Warning! As with the first book, there are some sexual scenes and references.  These seem true to the characters and times that Martin is depicting in the story.
B004K4IZ54|5.0|I saw this movie in 3D in theaters and I loved it. The movie is just as good without 3D though, and the blu-ray 3D, 2D, regular DVD and digital copy combo was a great deal for only $25. My purchase arrived promptly and was in perfect condition.

B004132I20|5.0|The Sherlock character grew on me but still was more socially inadequate and hyper than I thought he should be.  The series was well worth seeing.  It's only three episodes but they are 90 minutes each (plus the original pilot which follows pretty close to the re-done version).  I love that even the extras are captioned!  I'm glad I got it in blu-ray, lots of good from the air scenes of London.  It's the kind of series that I'll watch again and notice new details each time so well worth buying versus renting.  I had a different solution for the first episode.  I thought the killer was taking the antidote beforehand and all the pills were poison...
B004CIIXC8|5.0|I'm still recovering after watching this movie last night. What stays with me is the imagery of urban poverty, decay and disappointment set against a persistent, seemingly unsullied natural world that intrudes at every opportunity:  birds and trees and sky, fields and rain, bodies of water and, coupled with this, the main characters' intense sexuality: the well-spring of a hope as fragile as the life of this world.<br /><br />I cannot say enough about FISH TANK's wonderful acting, writing, and direction. The movie is a masterpiece.
0810997827|5.0|My 7 year old son and I read these books and laughed so hard we had tears in our eyes. I'm not going to give an actual review but just wanted to share - I was so happy I read these myself. I'm laughing just thinking about them.... the scenes with the little brother Manny are particularly hilarious. We also purchased the 5th book separately from Amazon and can't wait to read it!
0312323867|5.0|I didn't think I'd like 'Something Blue' because it was written from Darcy's point of view, the character you grow to dislike in 'Something Borrowed.' But by the end of this book I found myself truly liking and relating to Darcy even more than Rachel, and I didn't think that was possible!  I would recommend reading Something Borrowed first (and not just seeing the movie - it is not quite the same) and going into this book with an open mind. You'll find yourself going on a journey with all the characters, and it's fun to find out what happens to everyone!
B0009MWAVQ|5.0|This is one of the greatest recordings ever made. The music is of course endlessly inventive, and Ross's technically perfect execution and almost metronomically steady rhythm, while never losing the Iberian, flamenco-like fireworks of these sonatas, also makes clear that they are Baroque compositions, carefully structured and intellectually interesting at almost every moment. The performance is thus a revelation.
0312119038|5.0|This book is an excellent journal of one's faith journey and her ultimate decision to leave the convent.  I highly recommend it to anyone who might be in a faith dilemma so that they may see and understand Karen Armstrong's search for perfection in her journey throug religious life.  She overcame many hurdles and achieved a great degree of closeness to God but it wasn't enough to fulfill the committment she made to God whenshe professed her final vows.  It was a wonderful book and Karen's insights and her revelations of her trials and doubts are vividly recounted.
0061928356|5.0|I had breakfast with a friend the other morning and she brought this book to me.  We swap books and book recommendations, but are fairly careful to only pass along things we really like.  If a book is just average, it never gets mentioned.  It had been a while since she had brought me anything so I bumped this up at the top of my huge, massive TBR pile and started it last week.  On the first day, I read a huge chunk of it since I didn't want to put it down.  I am a fan of Jhumpa Lahiri and will pretty much devour anything she writes.  After reading this particular novel, Shilpi Samoya Gowda is jumped into that same category (and it's just her debut).<br /><br />In the opening of the novel we meet Kavita as she is about to give birth in a small village not too far from Bombay and the year is 1984.  This is the second child she has born recently and the first was \\"disposed\\" of since the child was not a boy.  Once the child is born and it's a second girl, Kavita takes matters in her own hands and does what she can to save the child by getting her to an orphanage in Bombay without the father's knowledge.  About the same time, another couple in the United States is discovering that the miscarriages and failing fertility treatments may mean no biological child for them but what about adoption.  Since the husband of the couple is originally from India, would it be possible to adopt a child from there?  These two stories are interwoven and these two families are the basis of this incredible novel.  One that grabs you early and just never lets go.  By the end of the novel, twenty years have passed and the fate of all concerned is known.<br /><br />As I said at the beginning, this was an absolute joy to read and a second novel by this same author will be snatched up quickly by me.  Another reading friend of mine asked me within the past couple of days what have been my favorite reads in the last several months.  I gave her a list of five books that stood out above everything else and this one was on that very short list.  Absolutely great!one was on that very short list.  Absolutely great!
B004BSIJ9Q|5.0|not going to say it's a classic just yet, that's more of a test of time than immediate quality but this album is amazing. hiphop, indie, pop heads all have something to find in this album. take it for what it is: a big album from a big artist that demands replay value. like a summer blockbuster you'd actually want to watch again. hate kanye or not, this album is great.
B0034G4P80|5.0|(I am not a fan of the former Thor comics, so this review is based solely on the movie.)<br /><br />I LOVED IT!  I saw Thor in the theater in 3D and it was wonderful.  It was excellent in 3D and on the big screen, so if you get a chance, catch it while it is still in theaters.<br /><br />Natalie Portman, and several others, are in a desert area looking for lights in the sky when they see a huge tornado-like funnel.  They start driving to get away when SMACK!--Natalie runs right into Chris Hemsworth.  She did not know he had just fallen from the sky, crashing to earth.<br /><br />We jump back in time to find that Thor was the 1st son of King Odin of Asgarth and heir to the throne.  Although King Odin had brought peace to the Universe, the bad guys were still waiting to get revenge.  Right before Thor can be pronounced King, the bad guys attack.  The King forbids Thor to go after them, but he disobeys and is banished to earth, where he meets Natalie.<br /><br />Of course, the plot thickens and we learn of the lies and deception from power hungry beings.  Sir Anthony Hopkins plays an outstanding role throughout the movie(as always) as King Odin.  Renee Russo (whom you may remember from the Lethal Weapon flicks) plays the Queen.<br /><br />This is an inter-planetary action plot with lots of action scenes (fighting/blowing up).  The CGI is awesome!  We even have a rainbow bridge portal from one area of the universe to another.  Stay with the flick when it ends and watch the shots of the universe while the credits are showing, too.  They are also awesome.
1400052181|2.0|This book arrived with large ink blots on several pages.  I'm assuming it was damaged at the printing press as I ordered it NEW from Amazon.  Also, it was a gift and Amazon did not include the card I requested for this gift so the recipient did not know who had sent them this damaged book.  It was a disappointing experience.  The book, however, is great...I had read it before.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|Heck, thank god he had nothing to do with anything else except Star Wars. I know, there's Indiana Jones, but I think it's safe to say that Spielberg won't let him ruin that too.    That's what the new fans can't understand about us who can't stand the new versions. It's not just that he's creating new effects, it's that he's ruining the experience by destroying the original. They can't understand it because it hasn't happened to them yet. To love something for decades, realizing that you contributed to enlarge its creator's bank account, and to hear from his own mouth that that thing you once loved doesn't exist anymore simply because he feels like butchering it. Those who think he's right should be aware that by endorsing this action they might fall victim of someone else doing the same with something THEY love in the future. Then they will understand.    Speaking about George Lucas, I really can't understand him. On one side it looks like all he cares about is profit, on the other, he reduces said profit by alienating many (if not most) of the people who helped him built his own empire. Maybe all he wants is to generate discussion so he can be just as famous as his creation. I don't know.    So let's just be thankful all he can ruin are the Star Wars movies. Can you imagine the atrocities Lucas would have done to films like Casablanca. To fit with the Star War films, he would probably turn all the soldiers into imperial troopers, replace Louis Armstrong with some childish CGI character and change the title to \\"Mos Eisley\\". That would be the day.

B0045HCJ6M|5.0|This is an ageless piece, a love triangle between three people in love. It represents the passion between Guenevere and Lancelot, and their respectful love for the wisdom of King Arthur. The poison of a love of passion over the love of respectful idealism. The music is as refreshing today as it was forty five years ago. I saw this move in 1967 at the age of 13. Because I loved the story of King Arthur, and the Knights of the round table. This was the first musical I had ever seem. I was smitten as youth, and have loved this movie as much today as I did forty five years ago. Richard Harris is brilliant as King Aurthur, Vanessa Redgrave never looked lovelier in any role before or sense. Franco Nero as Lancelot was a perfect selection for this role. I do not care one bit that they dubbed in his singing voice. I takes nothing away from his brilliant portrayal of Lancelot.  This is a movie to be cherished as much today as it was in 1967.  LONG LIVE THE LEGEND OF KING ARTHUR, LONG LIVE RICHARD HARRIS in his brilliant portal of this mythical King.  Bud Olesen

0385335989|5.0|Diana Gabaldon has created characters with such depth that you feel as if you know them personally. As she creates the environment of her stories she includes all of the sights, sounds and smells needed to make you feel you are in the middle of the action. Her ability to detail the love between Clair and Jamie makes them totally realistic. All of her main characters have fully drawn personalities and she explores their feelings with more depth than I have seen in other books I have read. Bravo to Gabaldon! I will be sad when the series ends. I can only hope that she continues writing so that we may enjoy her extraordinary talent for many years to come.
0756404738|3.0|The Wise Man's Fear is an entertaining read, but somewhat disappointing when compared with The Name of the Wind. The first part of the book takes place at the university, with a refrain of greatest hits from book one: mooning over Denna, worrying about tuition, serenading Auri on the roof, making stuff in the Fishery, pissing on Ambrose, researching those pesky Chandrian, etc. This is all fine, but other than the lessons with Elodin, it feels like a rehash of book one. The Denna scenes in particular become cloying and repetitive. Oh, and current-day Kvothe still interrupts the story every so often so he can stew and mope and polish some bottles before getting on with it.<br /><br />I enjoyed Kvothe's clever machinations in Vintas with the Maer, and wanted much more of that. But too soon, the story veers off into three minor (almost self-contained) subplots, which are okay, but longish and unmemorable. I won't complain too much about the groan-inducing silliness of Felurian because Patrick Rothfuss was after all only 13 when he first published this bit in Letters to Penthouse: IV; we've all been there. (I'm not objecting to the sex; I'm objecting to the fact that this is bad sex that does nothing for the characters or story -- in fact, it damages both.)<br /><br />So The Wise Man's Fear isn't a single, cohesive story, it's a collection of events, which would be fine if the different pieces were all engaging, but it's hit and miss. Personally, I don't care that much about plot. As long as interesting characters are doing interesting things in desperate situations, I'm happy. Just keep it interesting. In book one, Kvothe brought me to tears when he learned to play the lute and struggled to survive in Tarbean. And the events at university were so fast-paced and brilliant I couldn't put the book down. Although there are plenty of good moments in Wise Man's Fear, nothing comes close to the beauty and exuberance of the first book.<br /><br />And as Kvothe transforms from mischievous prodigy to loutish lothario, I found myself losing interest in him. His final, offhand, out-of-the-blue act of malice toward Ambrose was the last straw for me. I'll be cheering for Ambrose in book three.<br /><br />N.B.: I've been reading through the reviews and notice that many people love Devi and dislike Denna. An interesting question is how Devi would respond to Kvothe if he spoke to her the way he speaks to Denna. My guess is she'd vomit on his shoes and set his blood sample alight. The problem is that Kvothe and Denna are star-crossed lovers and therefore not allowed to speak sensibly to one another. It's all flowers in midnight gardens for these two, with the occasional spat thrown in to drag their story out for several thousand pages. Shakespeare could be florid too, but he had the good sense to give us just one balcony scene.
0143116177|3.0|This is a lively but superficial history of finance. Niall Ferguson surveys the evolution of credit and debt from ancient Mesopotamia to the Medicis in Renaissance Florence to the corporate finance bases of the Dutch, British and American empires. His chapters trace the rise of money and credit, the bond market, the stock market, insurance, the real estate market, and the rises and falls of international finance.<br /><br />Ferguson never asks where the money comes from, never asks who produces the world's wealth. Maybe he knows the truth - the world's workers produce the wealth and the world's capitalists nick it.<br /><br />Argentina's default in 2001 was the biggest in history. 500,000 creditors had to accept new bonds worth 35 cents on the dollar. As Ferguson writes, \\"So successful did its default prove (economic growth has since surged ...) that many economists were left to ponder why any sovereign debtor ever honours its commitments to foreign bondholders.\\" Default really is good for you - unless you are a bondholder.<br /><br />Ferguson points out, \\"It's not owning property that gives you security; it just gives your creditors security. Real security comes from having a steady income.\\" Capitalism can't achieve this - witness the 20 per cent youth unemployment here and the 45 per cent youth unemployment in Spain.<br /><br />Countries, like individuals, need to have a diversified portfolio of assets, and must not put all their eggs into one basket, as Ireland did with its insane property bubble and bust.<br /><br />Ferguson is so love in capitalism that he skates over its huge bubbles and busts, its vast injustices, its dependence on exploiting the great majority of the world's people, and the huge extent of world poverty.
B003EV6DBM|5.0|As a Whovian I was worried about how the new Doctor would be, but as always the Doctor is fundimentaly the Doctor and I do like Matt Smiths portrayal. He is easier to see as the Doctor regenerating from David Tennant their personalities are similar. It was hard for me from Eccelson to Tennant their personalities were so different. All in all I love the Doctor
1589949811|4.0|This is the core set of Fantasy Flight Game's new Living Card Game set in J.R.R. Tolkien's fascinating universe.    Background:  Set in the time after the events of the Hobbit and before The Lord of the Rings this new card game aims to deliver a new set of stories that evolve around the characters of Tolkien's Middle Earth. As this is a Living Card Game, the core set provides just an introductory set of cards, that will be increased with monthly expansion packs.    Overview of the Game:  The Game can be played with 1 - 4 players, the interesting aspect here being the game can be played solo. Also this is a cooperative game, so the players join forces together in order to defeat the evil that lurks within Mirkwood.   The Core set provides a set of 12 heroes and four according decks to start right away. Each of the decks covers one sphere and corresponds to a triplet of heroes. Spheres are thematic compounds to which all cards except Gandalf belong.   The four Spheres are: Leadership, Tactics, Spirit and Lore. They each have quite a different feel and style of play and provide a lot of flavor and diversity.   Once the players set up their decks, the aim is to meet certain requirements provided on quest cards. Once the requirements of a quest card are met, the heroes move on to the next stage in a quest (represented by the next quest cards). The quests in the core set have three stages, once the third stage is completed, the heroes win the game. Should the heroes be defeated or succumb to the evil powers (represented by a threat count for each player) they will lose the game.   Of course the heroes will face hordes of enemies and evil sorcery and have to explore a variety of locations in order to complete these quests. Luckily, there are dozens of equipments, spells and allies to assist the heroes in the direst hours.     Critique:  The game has quite a new feel to it, it seems the developers put a lot of thought into creating a new game experience and succeeded well-enough in doing so. The mechanics are interesting and the tension rises as players move along the path (represented by quest cards). The four spheres provide a very diverse game play and the free possibility to create decks using the cards of the core set allows for even more variety, as spheres can be combined and different hero-combinations can be explored.   However, the core set provides only little cards to allow for much options in deck building. According to the rules a tournament deck should consist of 50 cards, but the core set doesn't provide enough cards for each sphere to create a valid 50 card deck for each sphere. (The starter decks only consist of 30 cards each). Thus, the deck building possibilities are very limited, which is a bummer given the extreme difficulty level of the quests. Also the game experience changes a lot depending on what cards are drawn of the encounter deck, adding a lot of randomness to the game. Thus, sometimes a victory doesn't feel like a real victory, but more like a lucky streak. With the current selection of cards, defeating the second and third quests reliably in solo-player is impossible and thus the much advertised single player mode of the game fails to deliver. A pity, since mechanic-wise everything would be there for a great adventure alone or together with friends. Buying more core sets to increase the number of cards would solve the shortcomings of deck building possibilities.    The adventure packs:  The adventure will provide a monthly addition of new cards. So far the first one has yet to be released, but according to ffg the packs will consist of one new scenario (quest), one new hero card, nine unique player cards (in sets of three) and an encounter deck for the new quest. The adventure packs will be grouped in cycles of six packs that form together with the core set a thematic unit. The current cycle is the Shadows of Mirkwood cycle. Considering the addition of only nine new cards (distributed among four spheres) with each adventure pack, the lack of cards of the core set will not be undone quickly and players have to be quite patient before some real deck building can be done.     Summary:  The game feels great. The mechanics and the flavor of the setting provide both: A fun gaming experience and a great story. Due to the limited number of cards the deck building aspect of the game is somewhat a joke and given the extreme level of difficulty I highly recommend to find some friends and tackle to quests together. The game comes to full fruition when played with two or three players. (Basically one core set provides enough material for four players, there might be too few tokens and there are only two threat counters in each core set).   The adventure packs will further the story and provide new quests and cards and hopefully thicken the somewhat thin experience the core set provides.
B004N44SOI|5.0|\\"This Is Gonna Hurt\\" is the second studio release from Sixx A.M. They also have released \\"The Heroin Diaries\\" and a live cd titled \\"Live is Beautiful\\"  I absolutely LOVE \\"The Heroin Diaries\\" and was quite concerned that the band's second release couldn't possibly live up to the expectations that I had placed upon it. I am very happy to report that my concerns were unwarranted. \\"This Is Gonna Hurt\\" is the second consecutive masterpiece from Nikki Sixx, DJ Ashba and James Michael.  This, like \\"The Heroin Diaries\\" is an incredible cd !! I simply cannot pick a favorite song, as that changes each time I listen to the cd. There are NO weak songs on this disc. First thing I noticed was that 2 of the songs, \\"Help Is On The Way\\" and \\"Goodbye My Friends\\" could easily have been on \\"The Heroin Diaries\\" cd. The lyrical content of those two songs lead me to believe that they may have actually initially been written for that cd. They would fit perfectly in sequence near the tail end of the first cd. \\"This Is Gonna Hurt\\" is a collection of powerful songs. Some powerful in the music itself, some by way of the lyrics. The cd easily could have been called \\"Beauty Is Skin Deep\\", as that is the underlying message throughout most of the disc. The lyrics are mostly dark and moody, yet thought provoking. It's difficult to single out a few of the songs, because I could go on all day saying something about each and every song. At this time [and the list keeps changing] my favorite songs are \\"Sure Feels Right\\" and \\"Skin\\". The songwriting is top notch, the musicianship remarkable. Unlike a Motley Crue cd, this disc [like \\"The Heroin Diaries\\"] utilizes horns,piano and strings, yet is a powerful disc full of hard rocking songs with great hooks. I absolutely love James Michaels' voice as once again he fits his voice to the mood of each song perfectly. As with the first release, \\"This Is Gonna Hurt\\" is a collection of songs that I not only love to listen to, but songs that stir something inside meand cause me to react emotionally.When \\"The Heroin Diaries\\" was released I immediately dubbed it my favorite cd of ALL TIME. Well, now it's tied for that Honor with \\"This Is Gonna Hurt\\".  I know it's extremely unfair, but I cannot wait for their next release !!In the meantime I am genuinely grateful that I now have 2 absolute musical masterpieces in my collection !! Thank You Nikki, DJ and James
B004KSQN7C|4.0|I really don't take Britney that seriously when it comes to music, but that being said this album is really good. She is definately an entertainer. She always has been. Without the studio magic her voice has always been weak. But, she still puts out fun albums and is one of the best entertainers in the world. I would never see her live in concert because that's not my thing. I like bands who play their own instruments and don't really dance around and lip sync. (You know she does sometimes on stage)(Stop, you know she does)That being said she's still fun. This album is very good. I like it.
B003UESJHE|5.0|This is a must see movie for those who like drama and movies based on historic events. This movie easily won the Oscar for Best Picture 2011, as it should have.     The casting was terrific, as Colin Firth won an Oscar in his role as King George VI, the king who served as monarch of the UK and its territories from 1936 until his death in 1952. Geoffrey Rush should have won the Oscar for his portrayal of Lionel Logue, the speech therapist who worked with King George VI until his death. Helena Bonham Carter was also exceptional in her role as the strong and loving wife who was Duchess of York and ultimately Queen Elizabeth, the mother of the current Queen Elizabeth. All the performances were deserving of awards.    I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys historical dramas.

0307269752|5.0|Firstly, for those who didn't give this a 5 star review, I can't imagine they read the entire series. In order to get the full effect of this book, you must complete the series!!! It is one continuous story, that can't be left unfinished and then judged. It just isn't fair! lol. Bottom line, if you don't take the time to read this series, you're an idiot. You're completely missing out on some of the best fiction of our time. And the quite possibly one of the greatest heroines ever written! I can't say enough about this story. It has everything. Incredible.
B00005UO5Z|1.0|Haven't been able to enjoy product yet. It was my first time using amazon and I was unaware that you had to order a certain region in order to Play the DVD. Needless to say when I gave my fiancé his gift and we sat down to watch it we were both disappointed when a Region error message appeared and we realized we would have to send it back. The disc did arrive on time though, so I can say they were prompt, I just wish when they saw I lived in Louisiana they would have informed me the particular item I had selected only played in like japan.

B000XR4OC0|4.0|I love these shoes! I bought my first pair last summer in black and I basically wore it until it fell apart. It has holes on it and some areas of the soles are just totally worn out but I still wear it sometimes because it's really comfortable. I wear it to school and at work ( I work at a restaurant so I am always on my feet, pacing around). I think it held up pretty well, and thinking that a pair is donated to the needy, I thought it's nice to buy more which I did. I bought two more pairs, one in white and another one in olive green but they didn't fit as well as the first pair I had even though I bought the same size. It was a little lose, so the shoe comes off when I walk. I bought an insole and it helped a little bit on the olive green pair but the white ones I had to return which is too bad. So, I guess just be a little careful with their sizing because reading the reviews on here and on the Toms website, it seems like there are some inconsistencies with it. Also, when you wear these shoes everyday, make sure to wash it. I wash my pair with the dark clothes and I never had a problem with the dye running. It made the shoes look cooler because it has this worn out look now. Never put it in the dryer; just put it by the windowsill and keep your feet clean because these shoes, even though very breathable can stink up your feet if you're not going to take care of it.<br /><br />Just like others, I also think these shoes are a little overpriced and there are a bunch of similar styles now for half the price. I just try to keep in mind that the company is doing goodwill by donating a pair to those in need. These shoes are still my favorite for walking around downtown and to wear at work.
0131479415|4.0|This book was really fun to read. The chapters are well organised and you can read each of them in small amount of time \\"iteration\\".    In my case, I found that it was also a good continuance of Software Estimation by Steve McConnell. Mike Cohn talks about many concepts that were inside Steve McConnell book and vice-versa.    I recommend it, either for a team manager or a programmer itself, the book explains very well the Agile methodology and gives tools to accomplish work efficiently.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|Thought it strayed a little from the book it was still a great movie.  I look forward to PartII.    \\"K\\"
B003ASLJO0|5.0|For Ford fans as well as Clint fans, women and men, a GREAT movie.  You will laugh, cry, get angry, and enjoy every second of it beginning to end.
B00004XQ83|1.0|The CD I ordered \\"Oh Brother, Where Art Thou\\" was so scratched I had to throuw it away.  I love the music but it was impossible to listen to.
B0042MDAL8|5.0|You wouldn't think it would make that much difference, but between a DVD and a Blu Ray of this movie it is astounding the quality of sound and picture.  Go for it!
B000E1JOSE|3.0|The CD is great, however the case was split.   Yes I can obviously go and buy a plain jewel case.   A pity the experience was marred by this happening.
B000Z27HLS|5.0|Well, I guess you see the 5 stars. This is yet another Masterpiece Theatre production of a Jane Austen classic. While Austen's writing does seem to start complying with a particular formula after you have read enough of her books or seen enough movies from same, this one does have a couple of new twists. I knew almost nothing about Felicity Jones prior to seeing this, and I must say that I thought she was a very good selection for the lead in it. Things which I find essential to these period productions are good sets, good scenics, good costumes, and good cinematography. This version gets high marks on all of those. IF you like Jane Austen, you will almost certainly like this.
B00127RAJY|4.0|This is a great workout DVD. I've only been doing it for a week so I'm still on Level 1 but I'm looking forward to challenging myself and keeping it up. 20 minutes is the perfect amount of time for me to work out right now because I'm planning a wedding and as the date get closer my list of things to do gets longer, which doesnt leave me much time to work out.
031261246X|5.0|For those of us that spend so much of our day on computers---or around objects that are controlled by them---you will read ZERO DAY by author Mark Russinovich with both interest and intrigue. The book takes you into what could be the worse case situation for some but what is a real threat for others. The question: what if someone began using our computer systems against us and for their own diabolical means?<br /><br />For character Jeff Aiken it is something that he has feared and now with incidents taking place all around him, it appears as though the threat is real. What is behind it and more importantly, can it be stopped before it's too late? This is the race that takes you through page after page of ZERO DAY.<br /><br />This is one book that techies and regular book junkies will devour.
0670022411|5.0|I absolutely loved this book - the characters, the writing style and the storyline.  I can't believe we have to wait until 2012 and later to see how this love story will end.  I so enjoy reading a good book like thisand the only bad part is that I came to the end.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|Perfect combo of looks and functionality. It is much better than any other calendar app I've used. I highly recommend.
B004A8ZWSS|4.0|Based on a 2005 French Film titled ANTHONY ZIMMER.  The Golden Globes nominated it for Best Picture, Best Actress and Best Actor contrary to people arguing whether it was a comedy or drama.  There's some sparkling dialogue moments here and there but you have to get that this isn't a typical Hollywood picture to get the film.  It's really similar to old 50s films like CHARADE and the like with a few interesting twists and lush scenery.  The homage to old style films arguably has more to do with why it got GG nominations.  Rufus Sewell was underused.  I expected to rank this movie lower so it was a pleasant surprise. STORY/PLOTTING: B to B plus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B; SETTING: B plus; MY GRADE: B to B plus; WHEN WATCHED: early May 2011.
B0000E1ALR|5.0|This product arrived on time and in good condition. It's sturdy and put together well. With the additional bonus disc it contains more than enough songs for one collection, especially at $13.85. I really enjoy Springsteen's music and lyrics and I'm sure this collection will come in handy on long road trips this summer.

030746363X|3.0|I followed Tim's advice for weight loss and muscle gain and it was a disaster.  I followed his advice to the letter.  I didn't cheat and I didn't halfway do it.  I jumped in with both feet.  I ended up gaining about 15 pounds the first month and the weight continued to pile on after that.  I recently returned to our work site in Asia and people who haven't seen me for two months tell me I look fat, tired, and awful.<br /><br />I've resumed my old lifestyle of eating a variety of foods and exercising a few times per week.  The weight is slowly coming off and my energy is slowly coming back.<br /><br />I'm not going to punish Ferriss with a bad review.  It's a well written book and inspired me to go better myself.  Unfortunately it just didn't work for me.  It might work wonders for you.
B004SBQAN8|5.0|It is really nice when I and my wife and teenager can all go see a movie and all enjoy the heck out of it. This was an excellent movie well worth seeing. I hope they make a sequel. Good family fun.

B004NSULHM|4.0|I love Radiohead and so of course I had to get the album. What struck me at was 8 songs. 8 songs?. This sounds like a album that was recorded without heart or the band, but then-like with \\"Kid A\\" and Amnesiac\\", it will take several listens to appreciate the artistic and musical talent in the album. Mellow and moving.
6304675348|4.0|Very good movie and i loved it when the seller hand wrote \\"thank you and enjoy\\"I loved that and the movie was good but its a VHS so i know all about it Thank you so very much you are great in every way
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This Kindle edition book was so much fun. And now I have a new author, Deborah Harkness, and because I listened to the audible version, too, a new narrator, Jennifer Ikeda, on my favorites list. The only problem I had with the book is that feeling when the book ended and the next book isn't available yet! So I spent my day in that withdrawal phase that happens when you have learned to love the characters and enjoyed the plot.<br /><br />What some reviewer were irritated with, the clothing issues, I found as signs of a modern professional woman who is trying to be 'normal.' I loved the range of senses Ms. Harkness called upon to present the world. Ms. Ikeda's accents made the characters come alive.<br /><br />I have to thank my cousin for suggesting this book. Only for her would I have read anything to do with vampires. I was led to believe, by the title, I suppose, that this would be about witches. :)
B0000640SB|5.0|great job and great movie i love it when the place you order from is on the ball and you get your order when it is promised thanks all
0061537969|4.0|This book very very sad and depressing... There is the obvious... with the dog Enzo facing his demise.  But the rest of the story is very sad as well.  Denny the main characrter other than Enzo, had a very difficult life that is outlined in these pages.  It seems as if he just can't catch a break.  One heartbreaking event after another, with Enzo the silent observer the whole way through.  This book has a very unique concept, being told from the dogs perspective.  And over all I really did enjoy this book... but if you give it a shot, I reccommend a full box of tissues!!
B00004STUL|5.0|Bad Boys is a great movie and i got it early and was very happy this MandR Media Is a great place and they rock thanks all
1416972242|5.0|While I really, really liked the first book in the series - I loved this one!  I loved the characters so much that I felt like one of the gang.  This book was action-packed, full of drama and intrigue.  I felt that it did not have a slow start like the first book; perhaps this is becuase the world and conflict was already set up for this.  This book kept me om the edge of my seat, and while I rented the audiobook to listen to in the car, I found myself bringing it inside because I couldn't stop!  What I loved about this book was the Clary/Jace interactions.  It was forbidden and kind of weird, but I loved it!  And I found it so realistic too.  If you fall in love with someone, I don't think it would be easy to just get rid of those feelings automatically because you find out you may be related (as gross as that sounds).  But, by now, I had the feeling that everything wasn't as it seemed, and there was doubt in my mind that they really weren't related.  So I was less mad about the ending of the first book with the siblings revelation because of those seeds of doubt.  Whenever I listened to their steamy moments or the feelings they had for each other, I was gasping out loud and making funny noises.  I loved, loved, loved it.<br /><br />I originally didn't think I would like the audio book narrator, Natalie Moore, but found she did voices really, really well. I think I ended up liking this narrator better than the first book's.  Moore made Clary's voice sound less whiny and babyish.

1607886278|4.0|Room is one of those books that is hard to review. The subject matter is so aggravating and repulsive that a glowing evaluation almost seems like an endorsement of kidnapping, imprisonment and repeated sexual assault. Despite the undertones, Room is seldom graphic and I found it to be captivating and entertaining. Yes, the shell is rough, but in the pulpy middle once Jack and Ma work their way into your heart, a passionate portrayal of love and survival is revealed. That the story is told from Jack's 5-year old perspective is probably it's most riveting characteristic, and it's most aggravating. His voice is innocent and understated. The things that happen to him in room and even outside of it, he takes as a matter of course, having little else to compare life to. For a worldly reader, you may want to reach in and shake the boy from time to time and tell him that isn't how life has to be. I resisted a compulsion to second-guess Ma and her every decision, deciding instead to play through the entire novel first. At the end, I don't know if her decisions were the right ones, but I know that they were fair from her perspective. Not many of us could have ever said we'd walked in her shoes. The book leaves nagging questions unanswered, but it feels true since 5-year olds just aren't privy to all the things that happen in an adult's world, even those close to them.

B000BF0D9M|5.0|This 2-CD set is definitely a treat for all Cook fans as well as those who enjoy the sounds of a latin guitar.
B004XWLN20|5.0|I already own the first 9 seasons so I most likely will not be purchasing this set, though I admit the special features tempt me! This review is for anybody who is not a Smallville fan, or perhaps was one at one point but lost interest. This is my promotion for you to purchase this set and experience a journey that is truly epic. Smallville premiered when I was a freshman in High School, the same time Clark Kent was a freshman, though who really bought Tom Welling as a 14 year old? I remember being anxious for the premiere due to the fact I had always been a die-hard superman fan. The pilot did not disappoint, it gave just the right amount of intrigue and nostalgia as it set up the tale of a young Clark Kent as he begins his destiny towards becoming the greatest super hero the world has ever known. It was the perfect mix of action and teen angst as we watch Clark deal with everyday teenage problems when Clark is anything but the average teenager. The casting was perfect as Tom Welling looked every bit what anyone would envision the future man of steel to be. What teenage girl wouldn't fall for that dark hair and baby blue (errr...green) eyes? I began to watch the show fairly regularly, back before DVR; I recorded the episodes on VHS tapes for later viewing. I'll admit the first couple of seasons got a little repetitive with the whole \\"freak of the week\\" line up but it was always worth it for those juicy morsels of superman mythos. I didn't over analyze the show or get mad when they went off comic book script, I took it for what it was which was just entertaining. Smallville just became my thing; my 45 min escape from all things real world and everything fantasy. As I went into my college years I stopped recording the show regularly and for the most part lost track of all things Clark Kent. Then one random day I received a care package from my Mom that contained the first 4 seasons on DVD. I immediately went down memory lane as I began to re-watch the show I stoppedwatching years earlier. It was great to catch up again and after finishing the first four I immediately wanted season 5 and 6. So I hit the local best-buy and added to my collection. The show was only getting better for the most part and I was starting to see more and more signs of Superman. Then after I finished season 6 I again lost track of Smallville, I honestly didn't think the show was even still on. Then last year I was breezing through Amazon.com and saw a promotion fro season 9. Season 9!!! Wow the show has lasted 9 years. Right then and there I bought Season 7-9 and pretty much devoured them in a couple months. I then even went back to watch from the beginning right before the 10th season started on the CW. I can't really explain what it is about Smallville, I just love it! I admit not every episode has been stellar; and there were definitely times I had some cringe-worthy moments watching the show. However, the same theme has been true throughout and never faltered, it's the story of a man destined to do extraordinary things. This season of Smallville has made it to my every week DVR list and I love being able to watch once a week or catch up on a couple over the weekend. I even go back from time to time and grab one of my DVD sets and throw on an episode I'm in the mood for. I'm sure I've seen every episode at least twice and some even more. Now on May 13, 2011 Clark Kent's journey is coming to an end. It's bittersweet for me, as much as I would love for it to continue it's time for Clark to become Superman. I honestly feel the show over the past couple of seasons has been the best it's ever been and it's good to go out with a bang! The good thing about Smallville is that you know it never really ends; in fact the ending is the beginning which is inspiring. Though perhaps I have been a bit of a wish-washy fan over the years I have been a fan none of the less, so this Friday I will not be at my usual bar, I will be on my couch at 8:00 as I watch Clark Kent for the last (and hopefully the first) time take flight. Thank you so much to the Creators, Cast and Crew for all your dedication and hard work over the years and for fighting so hard to keep the show alive so it can end with the beginning it deserves. I hope that many of you will purchase this set so you yourself can be inspired to fly.      While these may not the BEST according to some these are some of my favorite episodes:    Season 1: Pilot, Stray, Tempest  Season 2: Red, Rush, Fever, Rosetta  Season 3: Perry, Truth, Forsaken  Season 4: Crusade, Run, Transference, Commencement  Season 5: Hidden, Exposed, Reckoning  Season 6: Arrow, Hydro, Justice, Labyrinth, Crimson  Season 7: Bizarro, Gemini, Apocalypse  Season 8: Odyssey, Committed, Bride/Legion, Hex  Season 9: Savior, Crossfire, Idol, Pandora, Salvation  Season 10: Homecoming, Luthor, Booster, Kent, (Finale?!?)
B003UESJ9M|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater and just loved it.  Garrett Hedlund's singing was amazing. I bought it just for that reason.  I was going to buy the soundtrack but saw that the people who sang in the movie were not doing the songs on the CD.  So I did not buy it. I was so impressed with the actors voices in the movie. I feel they should have been on the soundtrack. They did a fantastic job of singing.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|Very fun game although you can only take in small doses as it gets repetitive. Very stable, no bugs, graphics are give. Gui is great. The app is very nice. Very smooth. And a great deal for .99.

B000U0F7RG|1.0|The Gilmore Girls: The Complete Series Collection BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK! After I already ordered this Item and forgot to read the reviews I went back and read several reviews about how people were having problems like: scratched disk, blank disk with nothing on them, disk that wouldn't play, and missing disks. I found out by buying this box set it is like putting all your eggs in 1 basket.Your bound to have some type of problem trying to get a set of \\"42 perfect disk\\".Your pretty much guaranteed some sort of problem because your getting so many disk in 1 set at 1 time. After I opened my up (new directly from amazon) I opened mine up I found out my set had the missing disk problem and so since I figured the chances are high of getting another bad  set after reading other peoples reviews I decided just to return mine. I decided to go for the individual seasons because they are actually nicer and they don't come in a cheap cardboard case that causes the disk to scratched. I also researched other reviews of different dvd complete box set and they pretty much all reported to have some type of manufacturing error.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|Like many who have purchased this collection, I was totally blown away by the original film when I saw it opening weekend in 1999, truly an experience I had not had since seeing the original Star Wars when it opened. And, like so many, I waited with incredible anticipation for the sequels...and came out both times not exactly knowing what to think. Over time I grew to have great disdain for Reloaded and Revolutions, trying desparately to watch the original and cling to the fantasy of the sequels never existing.  Like Cypher, I wanted to be re-instered into the Matrix with no memory of what happened after I took the second red pill in 2003. I therefore passed on this collection on DVD, and gave serious thought to only getting the original on Blu. Then the price came down and I thought the original movie, the Animatrix and all those extras were worth the cost even if I never watched the sequels again. However, some time on my hands lately helped me decide to go ahead and delve back in, after several years of having not watched Reloaded or Revolutions. I must say that having had the time to temper my expectations and perceptions, I actually very much enjoyed the trilogy as a whole. My present day thoughts on each movie:    The Matrix - How can I heap more superlatives than countless hours of analysis have already given us? Suffice to say this movie is and was awesome. It broke rules and created a standard sci-fi action movies of today still struggle to meet. It definitely made the flaws of one of those other major releases (cough*worst Star Wars film ever*cough) of that year stand out even more. This is a classic in excellent form with great picture quality and extras...5 stars all the way!    Reloaded - For me, time has really been kind to this oft-maligned sequel. It took many of my preconceptions and ideas about where the story would or should go and basically flushed them like a freed pod-born. That used to be one of my criticisms, but I have to say now I actuallyappreciate these unexpected twists. It certainly still has its flaws, though: 1) Too many underdeveloped characters. I honestly didn't care much about what happened to most of these people, and that sucked given how much screen time they steal in Revolutions (but I am moving ahead prematurely). 2) Too much action...yes, there is such a thing. For all of the awesome effects-filled set pieces in both sequels, they at times become overlong and over-indulgent. It only needs to be that long if I have a controller in my hand! 3)The rave scene...does anyone besides a twelve year old boy (or someone with that mindset) like this scene? I realize it's supposed to be a life-affirming act and all, but it just comes off as rather poorly done soft-core porn.  Aside from these gripes, I found myself really into the narrative shift of Reloaded, the discussions about choice and where the path of the one would ultimately lead. This movie would probably have gotten about a 2 or 3 star rating from me back when, but today it gets a solid 4.5 stars.    Revolutions - No matter how much time I give it, this one remains my biggest disappointment of the trilogy (but hey I still say that about Return of the Jedi as well). Still, I did enjoy it much more with my recent viewing. So many subtle things I missed (or refused to see) in its narrative. My biggest issue? For all its visual splendor, the battle for Zion still kind of bores me...as I mentioned, I really didn't connect with the characters fighting the \\"war\\" and so just kind of marked time until we returned to what was going on with Neo and Trinity (or Morpheus and company). Given that was the action centerpiece of the film, it still suffers for it in my opinion. Oh and can someone please explain that S & M shoot-out scene? Seemed out of place for me. And no matter how grand the battle royale between Smith and Neo (and it is pretty cool if you ask me), none of their face-offs are nearly as good as the original one. It was more visceral, more real, and just plain better...but that doesn't mean the others suck, either. What used to really irk me about Revolutions was its ending. I used to absolutely hate it, but oddly that completely changed with my recent viewing. It just made more sense to me as I thought about it. I mean, seeing Neo take out the machines and destroy the Matrix would have been awesome, but wow the logistics of all those instantly freed minds are staggering to say the least. His sacrifice for peace is an example we should harken to...sometimes victory is about trying to settle the differences we have with countries and/or cultures rather than attempting to eradicate them from the face of the earth. If I rate this movie on its own, it would not do too well. Rather, I feel its merit (along with Reloaded) rests in being a part of a whole.  Given that, even with its flaws I will go with 4 stars.    The Animatrix is an excellent collection and gets no less than 5 stars from me, as does this collection as a whole. Re-visiting these amazing films with fresh perspective really changed my opinions for the better. This trilogy now has a place of honor along with my favorite series of all time!
B000WYCF6Q|4.0|I really like this mirror!  I can adjust it really easily and it gives me a decent shake proof image of the speed demons coming up from behind. I am going to get another one I like it so much.  I just wish that they used a clamp that required you to screw the thing on, as you really need to take it with you when you lock up the bike, as someone can easily steal it.
038572179X|1.0|Reading this book made me feel like I was reading it for a book report for school.  It is so utterly wordy that getting through it feels like you're being sucked back by each phrase like a swamp.  Swampy.  This book is swampy.  I couldn't get through it.  It is so over the top in explaining the minute details of things that you forget what the hell the point of it all is.  Many times I had to re-read passages to understand what was going on.  It's a muddy mess of a book, and I threw it out.  \\"National Bestseller\\" my left cheek!
B0006JGFNQ|5.0|I bought this for my wife. And I know how big of a Gizmo fan she is. Especially if thats her nickname, She really loves it. And also it does sing and dance. Worth buying for a Gremlins fan.
B004VGGYT0|4.0|This is a really good Ken Russell film.  I just don't understand why it needs a 3D release.  Who thought of doing this?
B003ZDZ1WG|5.0|I love every song on this cd. The lyrics are thought provoking (love, love, love the words!). The instrumentation is beautiful. Kimberly's voice is a mix of honey and vinegar and she segues easily. The overall mix is unique and refreshing. I enjoy all types of music and this cd is reminiscent of country, bluegrass, rock, and pop. Absolutely delightful.
044024367X|1.0|This Jack Reacher novel was complete miss and a waste of time.  Lee Child's choice of injecting his politics into this Reacher novel was a bad one, particularly since his politics don't seem to mesh very well with the character he has created in the previous 11 novels (an MP who approves of deserters?). To hear Jack Reacher moralize about the Iraq war and then voluntarily set off a dirty bomb in Colorado was a bit too much.  Setting off the dirty bomb set me off for several reasons; 1) it wasn't necessary at all since the alleged \\"bad guys\\" had been stopped, 2) Reacher played games with the subdued bad guys, then purposely set it off himself, 3) those of us from the Western US don't consider 500 square miles of Colorade expendable so Reacher can get his revenge on a fundamentalist Christian, and it was extremely \\"un-Reacher\\" (out of character)to do it in the first place. I guess afer the first 11 novels I was expecting a much more \\"in-character\\" Jack Reacher than we got in this novel. Lee Child needs to remember who his base of readers is.
0743581601|4.0|I enjoyed the audio book with both narrators doing an excellent job creating the right aura around the main characters and imposing eloquent descriptions of the surroundings. The story itself starts at the high note with rousing expectations of the astonishing life and forbidden love story weaving the subplot of ghosts and abnormal events. Although, \\"Thirteenth Tale\\" is not really a ghost story, it is definitely engrossing tale of the maddening siblings love, abandonment, murder and deceit, and it is told in a sleek overtures then sometimes feel like listening to the wintery mix behind solid oak doors. However, sometimes this saga has been losing the momentum for me, and I thought I would have trouble finishing the book but because listening in the car was much easier, I was able to accomplish the feat, and was quite sad that I had to leave the premises of the book and move to the next one. So it is not a perfect tale but intriguing enough to be recommended to anyone who enjoys good old-fashioned books about rich families, their fortunes, aloof upbringing and disasters and distressful situations.
030745455X|5.0|I didn't know what to expect when I ordered The Girl Who Played With Fire.  I had heard that the movie was great, but I had also heard that the book was difficult to follow.  Personally, I had no problems following the storyline.  In fact, I was so entrenched that I had could not put the book down, and I immediately ordered the 2nd and 3rd editions to the trilogy.  Lisbeth Salander is an enigma, and she is an unbelievably unlikely heroin.  However, you can never count her out , and she is at her best when backed into a corner.  Mikael Blomkvist is also an intriguing do-gooder with professional integrity and some unidentified charisma that make women throw themselves at him.  The other character are well-developed also.  Overall, a great read that hooked me in the first few paged.
B0034G4P80|5.0|Thor is based on a lesser-known character from the Marvel Comics line. Thor is undisciplined and therefore his father, the king, is reluctant to see him ascend to the throne. Thor is thrust into another realm, in this case, earth, where he encounters some scientists.  A romantic connection ensues between him and the lead scientist, played by Natalie Portman. The visuals in this film are stunning and the 3D effect enhances them. However, this film is more than just a comic superhero movie. There are elements of romance, comedy, and drama present, making this a motion picture that will appeal to all audiences.
B000TGCR3S|5.0|I received the movie about 4 days after i ordered it, item was in great shape no complaints here would do business again
1594744769|3.0|I am always fascinated when authors work different medias in their work. As a fan of graphic novels, I am always pleased to find an author who is not afraid to integrate visual material into his or her storytelling. Even more impressive, are those are able to do so without crossing over into another genre. I believe that Ransom Riggs does just that. The brings in photographs and uses them to help tell his story without making it a graphic novel or art book. Instead, the images supplement his story and add a dimension that is both enchanting and at times frightening. Some may say that a great author should be able to tell without showing, however, some of the photographs that Riggs shows the reader are so peculiar that it would be nearly impossible to adequately describe them. By adding in this medium, Riggs walks a fine line between making a unique novel and tripping over into being gimmicky. Fortunately, Riggs spends most of his time on the former side of the line. Still, the novel is not without its faults. Though as a first novel, I am quite impressed!    The story begins with a 16 year old boy named Jacob who is an outsider in his town, school, and his own family. The only person with whom he feels a connection is his grandfather who weaves magnificent stories about an orphanage on an island that was home to children with bizarre talents. When Jacob was younger, he relished his grandfather's fairy tales but teenaged cynicism stopped him from believing. When Jacob finds his grandfather brutality murdered in his own backyard, Jacob begins to wonder if the stories he was told as a child not actually be true. He travels to the island to find the orphanage in hopes to gaining some insight into his grandfather's life and death. What he finds there is amazing, frightening, and leads Jacob to more questions than answers as he realizes not only are these legends true...but the peculiar children might still exist.  It should be known, that there are definitely elements ofscience fiction or the supernatural in this novel. So if your mind does not wander to the odd and possible fantastic, this is definitely not the book for you. I love that the novel is peppered with photographs of these children which helps the reader visualize some of their talents. However, at times it felt like the story was just a connect the dots linking up the various interested images. I found the first few chapters to be breathtaking and Riggs insight into Jacob's troubled mind after the death of his grandfather was touching and real. Yet, Jacob climbed deeper and deeper into the island's past, I felt myself losing interest. I thought that his relationships were superficial and therefore I questioned some of the decisions that he made. If this novel is geared towards young adults, I think that it will do well. But for adult readers, I think it leaves a bit to be desired. That said, I look forward to Riggs' development as an author as I think he has some incredibly interesting and perhaps groundbreaking ideas.

B004FRX0MY|4.0|If you use this app and use any sort of tethering application, this will BREAK your tether. Since it sees WIFI enabled when you tether it will periodically check for connectivity because it gives preference to WIFI over 3G/4G. If you have issues, you have toforce stop and or uninstall which really is not cool...    Amazon if you are reading this please allow a 3G/4G only option in the connectivity preferences.
B000WGWQG8|2.0|I read the book so the John Adams HBO Miniseries could not even compare.  If you did not know your history you wouldn't know what was happening.  Bad acting and choppy scenes.

0553805371|1.0|To me, the contents of The Grand Design is not a book. This is more of a resume that aims at covering some voluminous topic and I would even put a poor grade on the occassional thoughts interspersing the story. Lack of depth, lack of originality, even inability to include latest developments in superstring theory and cosmology. I already have blood running out of my nose when I have to read through the historical background of cosmology and science generally in every single book on the topic. Doesn't it occur to the writers and editors that the people buying such books would have had definitely attained the basic laymen knowledge in advance. It is great to have such summaries in a first book of a series, but in each following book on the same topic by the same author? Come on!<br /><br />The Grand Design is a classical  case of a pubisher using a popular name to sell a product of inferior quality. Too good I borrowed it and did not buy it!
B004I4H8PO|2.0|Layla et al does not mark a milestone in my life, it is a milestone and, therefore, beyond reviewing.    The pathetic Universal/Polydor packaging, however, is another thing.     I empathise with almost all reviewers before me - we've all experienced varying degrees of content damage. The outer presentation box was ripped, discs had glue on them and vinyl was scuffed and had fingerprints all over. Come on, in today's world these issues should simply NOT occur, particularly with a premium European sourced product. China and South East Asia are hot on your tails guys and will overtake you very soon in terms of QC. Talk about watching the lemming-like suicidal downfall of the music industry...    One day box sets will disappear and I'm madly collecting what I can, but we're not idiots and will not continue to buy if the record companies don't lift their collective games.    Unfortunately, according to Amazon (whom should also lift its packaging game and surely cannot afford to take these things lightly), there are no Layla box sets left. Amazon should also be using its considerable influence to beat these companies into submission. I understood the first batch of these suffered the same QC problems. Demand was so great that Universal had to do a re-run. I would have thought they would have listened to the roar of the dissatisfied customer and learnt from their mistakes, but apparently not.    I think we're being taken for a ride. Maybe we should just stick to our original vinyl/CD's and boycott future box sets. Take a leaf out of Revenant Records/Rhino Handmade who sets the bar high for quality and dedication to the finished product.

B000KKPN5C|4.0|This is the flash to buy if you are looking for a light-weight and portable unit to serve mainly as a fill flash but need some directionality and more power than an on-camera flash.    The flash rotates up and down, but not sideways, so you can't bounce the flash off the ceiling if shooting vertically.  Also, the flash does not sit very high off the camera, so you may get some shadow from your lens in your pictures if your lens is very long and/or not zoomed in past the shadow zone.  This isn't a problem if you are bouncing the flash rather than pointing it straight at your subject.    Usability couldn't be better: just flip the power switch and shoot - no menus or other settings to fiddle with.  It's also very light-weight and compact, so it's not awkward or uncomfortable to carry around on your camera all the time, ready to go.    I only rated it three stars on features, but then the point of this flash is usability and portability, not an extended feature set.  It does exactly what it is intended to do very well.
0307279189|5.0|Who would have ever thought I would be reading a book on long distance running?  I enjoyed running as a kid but now - probably in my top 5 things NOT to do.  My oldest son runs and actually enjoys it and I couldn't understand why.  But \\"Born to Run\\" actually helped me see why people run.<br /><br />This was a very interesting and inspiring book.  I enjoyed the story of the Tarahumara Indians and their awesome abilities but I also enjoyed reading about other ultramarathoners, races, the Copper Canyon area of Mexico, the science behind running, barefoot running (which really seemed to strike a chord with me), insights into a certain shoe manufacturer.<br /><br />All in all, this was a great inspirational book.  I do wish it had photos in it.  That was the only thing I found lacking.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Even if I never read this book, it would be worth a donation to the woman who single-handedly brought down Sarah Palin. Her wit and honesty slayed that awful woman by holding up a mirror to her ignorance, ugliness and empty soul.<br />Giving $12 to Tina Fey gets me a much better ROI than the Democratic party ever could.<br /><br />Oh, and I bet it's worth reading too.
030726999X|5.0|I rate this as a five because I loved this book as well as the whole series.  The only complaint I have about the book is the insane amount of characters in the book.  It seemed like every page I turned, there was a new character or a name where I had to figure out which character was being referred to. But as I said, I absolutely loved the book!
B000000YNZ|4.0|This filled in a gap in my Bill Evans collection and shows him at his most introspective. His own tunes - Very Early and Re: Person I knew bracket some great ballad standards. Chuck Israels and Paul Motian provide sensitive support and swing. It's difficult to give any recording of Evans a low score and I'd rate this at 4 and a half stars.
0375507256|5.0|Mitchell's ability to drastically change his style from each story to the next is impressive, but even better is the real feeling he is able to imbue to each one of those stories, and the way he is able to thematically tie them together. Cloud Atlas is a fast read you will treasure.
0316056863|5.0|This book is brilliant.  Snarky, fun, relevant, opinionated, and flat-out hilarious.  It doesn't matter if you're not already a huge Tina Fey fan (I wasn't), you will be after reading this.  This book makes me feel not as alone in the world.  What could be better than that?

B000OPPBEQ|5.0|I'm huge fan of this trilogy but only now I got this collection. Excellent package, sensational quality of Blu-ray and a lot extra content, much more than 2-disc special DVDs. The Matrix was my first DVD and now, my first Blu-ray disc. I could not be happier! This is a must have!
B004SBS8LA|4.0|I would have given this game a five star rating, but, its a third of the way into may and the may lvl still isn't available(on my phone at least). I love this game... It's addictive. As soon as may's lvl becomes available I'll give it 5 stars.
B004TJ1H3C|1.0|Dang, double, triple dang... and I really mean damn.  I give this product one star as a sign of my dissatisfaction with the way executives manage television shows these days. The end of the final season was bogus. I do not understand the mindset of the television executives. They changed the time the show was aired, they had seemingly interminable breaks in mid-season because of basketball and baseball and holidays. Fringe, V, many other programs... why? And now, they want us to spend a boatload of our hard-earned cash on a story without any real closure. The message is this: \\"Hey all you fans! Now you can own the latest and final season of a show that jerked around the viewers so much, they all got motion sickness! Hooray for Dramamine! We don't give a rat's behind about you fans!\\" I get the sentimental ending with the interplay of cello and piano while Destiny rockets away to parts unknown, but we've seen that before... on earth, with cowboys and their horses, for heaven's sake. Remember Blake's 7? That was an ending!

B0019OP0GU|4.0|The Ballet Shoes was a very heart warming movie.  I see how Emma has branched out and it is nice to see her acting in other roles.  Very good movie I am glad to own it now.
0316056863|5.0|I get her, I totally get her. Sharp wit, the right amount of sarcasm, and some touchy-feeliness to soften the blow. Definitely Gen X. She says everything that the rest of us think, she just has the balls to put it out there. Much like Don Fey. Seriously, I laughed out loud through most of the book. Although, I did find some of the Palin stuff boring (maybe because I already watched it LIVE! FROM NEW YORK!) although the thought that went into some of it (who would have thought about all of those political implications? Not me). And Tina, if you read this, I think you are a beautiful woman and you are crazy if you think otherwise. I never noticed the scar until you pointed it out. Funny book, well written, even sometimes poignant (if you don't get a little teary eyed over the Y at Christmas then you don't have a heart).

I felt Room on Fire has a somewhat different sound from This is It, but I like it. I think This is It is better but Room on Fire is definitely worth the buy!
1587990717|1.0|I managed to get to page 177 and cannot do it anymore. This book reads like a cocaine driven rant that continually promises deliverance to no avail. As others have commented, this book has nothing to do with mathematics or statistics, on the contrary we are fooled by the biases with which we interpret data... So mathematics is baseless as it only proves the foolishness of humanity. Taleb is therefore not human as he seems to believe he is philosophically above it all, including philosophy.     The book sucks. Do yourself a favor, if you are still curious to read, then read any random sample of it on google books. You can even skip around the book after any paragraph as that is exactly how this book seems to be edited. Hmmm, makes me think about the reference he makes to monkeys pushing buttons in order write \\"coherent\\" yet random books which would, according to Taleb, with certainty yield the exact transcript of \\"The Iliad\\". This book must be a joke written by his monkey friends... Genius!!
B0034G4ORC|3.0|Battle Los Angeles is not the best alien invasion or war pictures but it is watchable in a nerve racking way. It makes the hairs on your neck stand at attention and your pulse  to quicken.<br /><br />Although the film dose uses the overused hurky jerky cinematography, is it able to give the audience a feeling of dread. Dread and foreboding and uncertainty  with smoky battle scenes and wide shots of Los Angeles on fire, that's what gives this movie its favor; a real American City that people have been to walked around in is on fire, overpasses are collapsed and there are bodies in the street.  Cyborg troopers stalk the streets and indiscriminately kill everything they come cross: men, women, children, civilian and military while unman drone aircraft patrol the skies and beat back American military might.<br /><br />The Invaders don't use much super science, they aren't armed with any kind of particle or beam weapon. They use more advanced kinetic energy machine guns with quad mechs and hover tanks, there isn't a radio signal they can't track, making communications in the combat areas impossible and the cyborgs versatile bodies make them very difficult to kill.<br /><br />The Invaders are in very similar ways similar to Harry Turtledove's Race in his \\"WorldWar\\" series of novels, advanced aeronautics, Faster Then Light travel, yet still relying on chemically propelled projectiles for most of their weaponry.<br /><br />The actually plot of the movie is nothing special, a group of marines lead by a wet behind the ears lieutenant and grizzly veteran(Aaron Eckhart) are order to head to a police station in Santa Monica to evac any civilians that where cut off by advancing aliens before the military plans to level Monica because even though the invaders don't seem to have any air power at the moment in the film their ground forces are pushing the military back.<br /><br />At the same time they come across an air force techhead (Michelle Rodriguez)who was tasked with finding the Invaders Command and Control before her unit was whipped out. The invaders are able to nuteralize Ameican air support, thus halting the bombing, and forcing Nantz and his squad to find the Invaders CnC cneter. The plot could have been easily used in a Roland Emmerich, film, but thankful Emmerich shameless uses of CGI is better aplied with dirty alien foot soldiers and war matchines scratch and dinged up, also Emmerich's character template of a misunderstood geek is thankfully absent. Instead we focuses on a small unit of foot soldiers who are at and behind the front lines.<br /><br />The weak points of the film is that there is only one interesting character, Eckhart's  Michael Nantz is a sergeant with a shady past, having several men die under his command, including the brother of one of his squad mates, in a past engagement. There are some other  interesting characters like the Nigerian Corpsman and the Squad Leader Cpl.  Lee Imlay, (then again \\"Alien\\" had no character development either) but the movie was so fast past with each character only speaking one sentence at any given time.<br /><br />Speaking of dialog, it is clichie.....and your problem is? What the hell did you except? Folks like Roger Ebert who spent no time in the military or don't know anyone who has service and view movies as an academic art form will of course hate the spoken lines in this film, because it's how soldiers in the battle field really talk, in short clipped sentences. Watch real battle footage on Youtube or Liveleak and you'll see the comparison.<br /><br />Also the reason for the Invasion is really dubious, our water? Yes water could be used for fuel if you distill it down to harvest it's hydrogen and use that to generate electricity, but the earth isn't the only planet that has water on it. The moon of Eruopa is a giant ice ball and the Invaders could of easily set up refineries in the upper atmosphere of Jupiter and Saturn and began to siphon off hydrogen that way. All of which would be more cost effective then a military invasion of a planet because it has liquid water.n of a planet because it has liquid water.
B002O1TMI4|4.0|Although Muse has typically been 3 star with a 4 star here and there, this album is good. Worth getting the CD. It is a soundscape drama. If no other Muse album makes it into your collection, this one should.

B001UV4XHY|3.0|I don't think much of this movie. I liked the other ones in the series. But, this one, not so much. There is more fighting in this movie than in the book. They didn't stay as close to the book as in the other movies. The others weren't EXACTLY like the books. But, they didn't have fights just to be having fights. I will get the last one, when it becomes available on DVD, just to have the whole set.
B004MKLRQA|3.0|There is some controversy surrounding the veracity of the story portrayed in the book. At first, I did not believe what the critics had said. However, after a careful read of the book, I do believe that the situations are at best exagerated, and at worst dubious. There are various inconsistencies in the book that should not exist, given that the author claims a photographic memory. For example, he claims that the story takes place in 1993, when he is 12 years old. However, history shows that Mattru Jong was held by the rebels in 1995, making the author closer to 15, as the critics claim. This means that rather than being a boy soldier for two years, as the author claims, it would have been more like 2 months. There are several other inconsistencies throughout the book if the reader is astute and does a little research.    I am also not a fan of Beah's writing style. It lacks coherency in some situations and is too casual for my taste. Having said all of this, the book still stands as a powerful reminder of the tragedies of war--in particular the use of children to fight them. The book has a powerful message of turning melancholy into hope, and it is worth the read if you can get past the fact that it is not as truthful as the author and publishers want it to appear.
0811874192|5.0|This book arrived for Mother's Day 2011 and was the perfect present! Multiple flower arrangements that can be changed on a whim and never need any watering. The elastic bands hold the book flat for display and to protect the other pages. Ray Marshall's work is exquisite. It's worth checking out his website to see other examples and maybe try your hand at using his templates to make a simple card. Highly recommended!
B003ZJJFKE|5.0|Not since \\"The Extremist\\" have I enjoyed a new Satriani album so much (not to say I didn't enjoy the others). An eclectic mix of tracks that doesn't need to rely on scorching solos or fancy tricks, just beautifully written and arranged melodies that make me want to play them over and over again. Opening up with the first track, \\"Premonition\\" is such a great sounding song that even I can play (well, not quite all of it) that astounds me with it's simplicity. From there it's an unusual but fantastic journey all the way to the wah-heavy \\"God Is Crying\\" at the end. Congratulations Joe on another masterpiece - you have been my musical inspiration for over 20 years!
0307593495|4.0|I loved this series and will miss it. I would read about Linda the daughter if the author would write about her. The M.C. was as blue as always but I felt it was true to character.  If you are looking for a series buy the first one and read them all.  You will not be disappointment.      I have read every book this author has written and there is only one bad one and that is the MAN From Bejing.  Buy and read the rest.    Going to miss Kurt, Sweden, and Linda.    PB

0670022411|2.0|I bought this book because it had all the elements I usually enjoy.  I felt it was slow and I had a hard time even attempting to finish it.  When the plot suddenly led the reader to a cliff hanger I forced myself to finish it.  If I had checked it out of the library I would have returned it unread.  There were also gaps is back stories and too many unanswered questions.  When I read more about the authors background these complaints made more sense.  She was trying to incorporate too much from her personal frame of reference.  The flow of the story suffered from it.

B004UC1WN8|5.0|I've been a J.Lo fan for basically my whole life & I cant say I've always been impressed with every release she's ever made, but I do have to say that this CD is extremely solid & the Deluxe Version is definitely worth your money. My favorite tracks on the album are 'Run the world', 'What is love', 'Invading my mind', & 'Take Care'. Check it out, you wont be disappointed!
0439023513|5.0|This is not an easy final book on any level.  It can be very dark and violent--children die, people are tortured and Katniss is overwhelmingly depressed for much of the book.  Certainly, she has been shaped by her society, although she has not been defeated by it.  She is utlimately accepting of her past and able to move forward in peace, if not hope.      Suzanne Collins has created a compelling story from start to finish.  The execution of her writing results in a straightfoward, easy to read trilogy packed with adventure.  The characters ring true, the jeapordy of their society is palpable, and there is alway, always evil to be battled.
B003MDDGTE|5.0|This album really is tops.  The musicianship is impressive, the production is as good as it gets, and the emotion stuns you every time you hear it.  [Their live show is pretty amazing as well] The track 'Afterglow' really stands out as the favorite here but all of them are incredible excluding the song 'This Orient'; it's not terrible by any means but it seems entirely out of place on this album (a purely subjective opinion) and would have been a more appropriate b-side.  It can't be stated enough how perfect the production is on this album. It's like every part of every instrument is precisely where it should be and couldn't possibly work any other way; kudos Mr. Smith.  After obtaining this on vinyl at their live show, I am convinced that it was made to be played on a record player.  The guitars sound incredibly warm and the bass is HUGE and perfect. This album deserves to be purchased, no question.
0316044938|4.0|It's so hard to say you like books like these. It's not the situation it's the story that is intriguing. A few of my friends didn't like the way that it ended, I didn't care for that too much but at least Mr. Harvey didn't got his. Not like I pictured but still. They were also put off by Susie's depiction of heaven which I thought was cool. Especially, her heaven and then the \\"big heaven\\" it's right on point with what most of them have been taught anyway, so why they didn't like it I don't know. The only part that threw me off was her coming back for sex...didn't quite get that one. I would think I would use that opportunity to say I'm ok, don't worry..look for the safe lol. But who knows really?
B002ZG99TA|4.0|An obviously fictionalized retelling of an actual event, `Unstoppable' is fast paced and engaging from start to finish, despite its limited themes.  In the film version of the story, an unmanned train wreaks havoc as it gains speed and becomes uncontrollable.  A veteran railroad engineer, recently given his `notice', decides to play hero while out training a rookie train conductor.  The pair, oddly mixed yet more similar than expected, take on the treacherous task of manually stopping the train.  Thanks to the chemistry between Chris Pine and Denzel Washington, `Unstoppable' maintains our attention, and deservedly so.  The plot at times seems farfetched, and the action can seem over the top and yet it all works thanks to some spitfire editing and sharp direction from Tony Scott, the lesser (yet the vastly underrated) of the two Scott brothers.  With nicely shot cinematography, expertly used visual effects and an effective score, `Unstoppable' is a lot more fun and thrilling and memorable than one may expect.  The rather unexpected heaps of praise the film received were certainly justified.  It's an obvious fabrication of actual events in order to heighten the `thrill factor', and yet it reads honest thanks to the dedication from everyone involved.  This is one of those summer flicks you won't feel guilty about watching over and over again.
B001HNE3NO|4.0|I am an avid reader. Especially great historical fiction pieces. This one is no exception. WWII is my favorite time period and this book was  compelling and complex spanning several decades touching on political themes and true events. I could not put this book down.
B003UYV08E|3.0|A lot of warnings went out when I decided to watch this film.  My friends all said \\"you'll be disappointed\\"... \\"the film is basically `Spider-Man 3'\\"... \\"It's a cluttered mess\\" and I believed them, but I didn't care because I loved the first film and was wearing my `Scarlett Johansson blinders'.  Truth be told, I was disappointed, but not for the reasons they listed.  First of all, the film is nowhere near as cluttered as it could have been.  It doesn't really throw away any notable characters like `Spider-Man 3' did (I will never forgive that film for teasing us with Venum only to barely use him).  It is nowhere near as cluttered as `X-Men 3' was.  Sure, there are a few faces thrown in the mix (War Machine is merely flirted with and Black Widow could have used more screen time) but overall, this film remains focused on the key characters, and it builds a noteworthy villain in Whiplash.  For me, the film's major fault lies in the fact that it felt rather uninspired.  Nothing really felt exciting and new and fresh and memorable.  The action sequences, while shiny explosive, felt uneventful in comparison to some of the more thought-out sequences in recent films.  The visual effects are very impressive, taking that whole `video game look' to another level with sequences that feel real, and yet those fight scenes just feel redundant.  The acting is fine; Robert Downey Jr. was born for this role, but he doesn't add any new layers to what he created in '08.  I wish Scarlett had more screen time, but whatever, she was hot as per usual and while she didn't do anything truly `interesting', she was, well, hot.  I still love Paltrow in this role, so more her please.  This isn't a total mess, in fact in parts it is very good...and Sam Rockwell chewed that scenery like his life depended on it and was, in a way, the best thing about this film.  I'll see the third installment (although the whole `new director' thing scares me a bit), but I won't walk in with the highest of hopes.
B002ZCY7SW|5.0|I have enjoyed '24' for all eight seasons (even the ones that weren't as 'up to snuff' as some of the others).  I'm sorry to see it go (though I think its format had 'run its course')!  SPOILER ALERT: I'm intrigued by the 'mysterious' / unresolved ending of season 8 and its 'tantalizing' prospect for the future.
0440245915|5.0|This is Grisham's first novel, but don't let that discourage you; he writes like Tolkien (without the glib settings and descriptions). Introducing us to one of the most brutal scenes of child rape (that far transcends the opening scene of the film), we are introduced to the people and town of Ford County. This fictitious southern hamlet is revisited in The Last Juror and the more recent Ford County Stories. Although the novel's climax is the trial of Carl Lee Hailey, considerable ink is spent on the backgrounds of Lucien Wilbanks and Jake Brigance. Even Jake's house merits a few paragraphs.    The themes of jury nullification, the importance of reaching a uniform verdict (a theme echoed in The Runaway Jury) and what constitutes true justice (twelve years for child rape and near-murder doesn't come remotely near it) are explored in deep detail. Beyond that, the Klan's methods are exposed for all to see (the threat of violence being their primary tool). They exemplify amoral racial supremacists who care for naught except their own agenda. Grisham uses this as a device to deftly weave a tale that is as much about true heroism as it is about true justice. Racism also raises its ugly head in the jury selection process. Bulky and ambitious DA Rufus Buckley manages to stack the jury in his favor (the only African American is an alternate), despite Ford County itself being over 10% black. Cascading consequences occur all the way through the tale, reminding us to look ahead as far as possible before making life-altering decisions.    I unequivocally recommend this book for everyone over 15 years of age.
0375850864|5.0|I'm a 55-year-old mom who loved this book. I want to read it again to relish all the layers of the story, the mystery and the wonderful characters. Each chapter invited me into a different aspect of Miranda's life over several months like the dabs of paint in a Suerat painting--when I stand back I am amazed by the big picture. Never boring though very detailed, it moved me forward to a frightening yet beautifully encouraging resolution. The Amazon description suggests this is for the 9- to 12-year old bracket, though much of the story may only have meaning for an older audience. Definitely recommended!
B004EJUMT2|5.0|This is going to be short and sweet:    While many people call them a King Diamond/Mercyful Fate rip off (and the likenesses are definitely there) this band is also quite unique. What is Ghost? Ghost is the Devil's theme music. Ghost is Satan cracking his whip at the non-believers. This is one very creepy band and one very creepy album. I can remember looking over my shoulder to make sure nothing's there watching me. It had a very evil feel to it. Modern metal at it's finest.
B004DI7HZ6|3.0|Had I known that this was just one long intro, I probably wouldn't feel so cheated. I love books in a series, but I strongly feel each book should stand alone. This has some plot action, but just to cement characters. When it ended, I felt like the stage had just been set for the actual story to start. Otherwise this is well written and an interesting read.
B000K1P66W|5.0|This is very special book.  I just finished reading it, and will read it many more times.  I believe this book is truly inspired.  I simply loved it.  A must read for anyone looking to live their life in a more positive way. The best book I have read in a LONG time!
0596805527|5.0|First a short introduction about me as the reviewer of this extensive Javascript book. I have worked with JavaScript for about 6 years, the last 2 years I dived more deeply into JavaScript, the main reason for this is freedom. I was mentally unrestricted in Flash and Actionscript 3, and I needed to free my mind for javascript as well.    Before this book I have read two other O'Reilly JavaScript publications; JavaScript the good parts and Javascript Patterns. Both excellent books to get a firm grasp of : structure, development and best practices of JavaScript.    For me the timing was right to dig deeper into the \\"framework\\" of JavaScript.  It immediately became clear that a lot of research has been packed into this book. The first sections explains the core features of Javascript this should get the reader quickly programming JavaScript in a right way. It is nice to see that the code examples in this section are short and self explanatory.    I read the second part with a lot of fun, this section fully prepares developers for ECMAScript 5 and HTLM 5. I learned a lot of new stuff and browser specific details. Possible pitfalls implementing new standards are clearly described. Some of the chapters I really liked were: Handling Events (17), Scripted Media and Graphics ( 21 ) and HTML5 API's (22).  The reference is very handy, I already have used it a lot of times. It is nice to have good reference, it's a fast, reliable and up-to-date way to look things up once familliair with the reference layout. Most times faster than a google request. With the confidence of getting clear and concise code examples.    To conclude this review I can say that this book is a must have for every \\"future-eager\\" front-end developer.     [[ASIN:0596805527 JavaScript: The Definitive Guide]]    Disclaimer: I was provided access by O'Reilly Publishing to an electronic copy of this book for review purposes.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Fantastic! Possibly the best book I've ever read. The writing is more than adequate, and this is one of the best, most heroic stories I've ever heard.
0307472841|1.0|Don't even bother to check this out from your library. \\"So many books, so little time\\" - don't waste your time on this one. I totally agree with all the one and two star reviews.
B004GCPJDQ|4.0|This device has made using a wireless mouse acceptable. I hated the mouse cord, but also hated having to change batteries every couple of weeks. I have a bag full of old batteries that I have to take to the disposal center. Installing the battery pack was a little tricky, but once you have it seated properly it works great. I originally did not have it locked in properly, and it kept on dislodging itself from the Magic Mouse. This device looks good on the desk, and does the job. It's the perfect complement to the Apple Magic Mouse. It looks like it was designed by Apple.  Just be aware that the percentage of mouse battery will not register 100% wen fully charged because Mobee uses a lower voltage battery pac. It does the job for me.
B004TE6F66|5.0|I will come out and say it. I like this book better then Shiver! While Shiver for me was a 4 star read something about the depth and clarity of the writing and the addition of one new character made Linger jump from a to-read kinda like the series to a can't wait for the next book to come out!<br /><br />Linger centers around Sam & Grace and the wolf pack in Mercy Falls, Minnesota that we came to love in Shiver. Originally the changing perspectives bothered me a little, I could clearly hear the voice of each character coming through in Stiefvater's writing but it left me wanting something more, mainly a solid perspective from just one person. I think thats why I gave Shiver a 4, I just couldn't fall in the love with the changing narration or the easy love between Sam & Grace.<br /><br />I am now glad that the series is written like this! In Linger I loved the changing voices and was happy for the addition of Cole, one of the new wolves made by Beck during his trip to Canada. Cole and his struggle with drug use, fame, and what it means to be human was easy for me to connect with and I enjoyed seeing someone struggle with these difficult problems in the series. It changed the series from superficial love to more difficult issues.<br /><br />To me in Shiver the love between Sam & Grace was too easy. I mean Sam was becoming a wolf and that is a big thing to overcome but I knew that they would be together so I never felt the suspense, and when he became human it was not enough of a surprise to make me feel anything but superficial happiness. In Linger the love between Sam and Grace is much the same but it is now Grace being taunted by her wolf past and Sam who is struggling to keep Grace. This dynamic was more intense and real to me and I'm excited to find out what happens in Forever! (Yes Linger leaves you on a total cliffhanger! Ugh July 2011)<br /><br />I am also happy to report that in Linger Isabel finds someone to connect with in Cole. They are both so similar in personality they seem like a perfect match, but that would be too easy wouldn't it?<br /><br />See if Sam can keep Grace and his human body, if Isabel and Cole are a perfect match, and what happens to the wolves in Mercy Falls in Linger! I really enjoyed the book and have a feeling everyone else will too.perfect match, but that would be too easy wouldn't it?     See if Sam can keep Grace and his human body, if Isabel and Cole are a perfect match, and what happens to the wolves in Mercy Falls in Linger! I really enjoyed the book and have a feeling everyone else will too.
B0033AGSYG|5.0|I have read this book so many times, the pages are literally falling out. It is historically accurate, which is a pet peeve of mine. Alison Weir is a very talented writer. If you're doing research on the Tudors, Alison Weir is a great place to start. I have almost all of her books. She is one of my favorite authors. Her books never get old. Pricing this book at $9 is an injustice... it is worth so much more than that.
B004IWR06S|5.0|This is a great movie that really takes a look at death, life, and the inbetween.  The acting is great, and the movie is heartfelt.  I recomment this movie, not only because I really enjoed the story, but because of it's spiritual leanings.  I'm glad that recent movies, such as this and Charlie St. Cloud,  have a bit of \\"paranormal\\" incorporated into their stories.
B004KD5TQI|5.0|First off, let me say that this album is well worth listening to for fans of any genre of music. You don't even have to like the movie to like the album, although being familiar with the plot of the movie only makes it a better listening experience. Although many have debated the quality of the movie (I for one absolutely loved it), the soundtrack is definitely worth experiencing for anyone who has a passion for beautiful music. The soundtrack starts off soft with Emily Browning's awe-inspiring, beautiful voice with \\"Sweet Dreams,\\" and it continues on with the awesome techno bass beats of \\"Army of Me.\\" \\"I Want It All\\" is just an epic song, especially when you're imagining the Mayor smoking his stogie while listening to it. Skunk Anansie's \\"Search and Destroy\\" has one of the best recent guitar solos I've heard. Carla Azar's \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" pays proper homage to The Beatles while putting a new spin on the song. Yoav and Emily Browning perform \\"Where Is My Mind\\" exceptionally well, with tons of emotion. Emily Browning's beautiful performance of \\"Asleep\\" is almost guaranteed to make you tear-up with it's emotionally-charged tone. I literally almost cried listening to \\"Where Is My Mind\\" and \\"Asleep\\" for the first time. They are probably the most beautiful, emotional songs I have ever heard. Overall, the Sucker Punch Soundtrack is worth buying and listening to multiple times for anyone who likes to listen to great music of any type.
B002GZQYMK|4.0|Really like this album--the songs are sequenced brilliantly, with all the pop stuff up front, then all the prog-rock Queen-ish stuff as it unfolds. Embarassed it's taken me this long to check out Muse... liked \\"Absolution\\" a whole lot as well.
B003YWUTKM|1.0|I love most of Pink Floyd , I respect and enjoy David Gilmour's talent . On this C.D. he marginally re-invents the 5 note alien-to-humans communication that is central to the film Close Encounters Of the 3rd Kind . And repeats it ... and repeats it ... and repeats it ... and ... it is tedious and uninspired . The underlying synth stuff is 2nd rate Tangerine Dream . No make that 3rd rate .
B0042U94UQ|5.0|My kids and I love this movie, it will really tug at your heart strings and have you cracking up with laughter at the same time.
B0034G4P80|4.0|In Thor, we are presented with an otherworldly hero of extreme power who hails from the planet Asgard. Thanks to his reckless arrogance, he is stripped of his strength and cast out from his home world, forced to live as a mere mortal on the planet known as Earth. Before he can regain his hammer and his power, he must overcome his faults, thus proving that he is fit to be king. Thor's comic book plot and over-the-top fantasy could have made it unrelatable, but Chris Hemsworth's grounding performance saves it from such a fate. He's chiseled enough to fill schoolgirls' dreams, but more importantly, he really nails this role. He manages to be spoiled and conceited, yet charming. He is a powerful prince and warrior but somehow hilarious. By the end of the film, he's the kind of hero you love to root for. And then there's Natalie Portman, every nerd's dream. She's as cute as always here, but unfortunately her character is not particularly relevant.<br /><br />In fact, Earth itself isn't particularly relevant. Most of the movie takes place on Asgard, the Asgardians are the main characters, and all the drama and conflict is between their world and J&ouml;tunheim, land of the evil frost giants. Earth is involved only tangentially, connected to these other realms by Yggdrasil, the world tree. A whole bunch of mythology is thrown at us, and though I tried my best to catch it, a great deal went over my head. Although I liked all the Asgardians simply because they were attractive and wore shiny clothing, I found it a bit hard to care about them when my old standby, humanity, was left out of the mix. I mean, Earth is never even in any danger! The trailers make it look like all sorts of evil creatures are going to start flooding our cities, threatening to destroy us with robots that shoot fire from their faces. In reality, only one villain ever comes to Earth to destroy anything. And in fact, its only purpose is to capture Thor--it's got nothing against us puny humans!<br /><br />And man are we puny. Natalie Portman's apprentice tazes Thor, but that's about the most any of us evolved apes does. Portman herself is just in the movie as a shallow love interest to fulfill the hero-learns-humility-by-falling-in-love trope. Not to say that I wouldn't fall for her immediately, but Thor spends only one or two days on Earth, and there are very few scenes of him and Portman interacting at all. He does appeal to the scientist in her, however, saying \\"The answers you seek shall be yours, once I claim what is mine.\\" (Which, incidentally, is how I'm going to be hitting on all women from now on.) Their romance just didn't hold water for me, especially since [Minor Spoiler Alert] the movie ends with them worlds apart, longing for each other. There simply wasn't enough time for their relationship to go from whirlwind romance to the \\"I'll spend my life searching for a way to travel through space so we can be together\\" phase. [End Spoiler Alert]<br /><br />While those faults keep this movie from achieving true greatness, they certainly don't prevent it from being basically awesome. Thor is a great character, the other worlds are breathtaking, and there's a good balance of action and comedy. Plus, Heimdall, the gatekeeper of Asgard, is undeniably badass; he wields a giant golden sword, sports a matching horned helmet, and has bright orange eyes that can see across the cosmos. Also, he's literally immune to being frozen to death.<br /><br />The only actually bad part of the movie was when Thor supposedly dies. [Spoiler Alert] The main character DOES NOT DIE! I know it's shocking, but it's the truth. He's lying there, all dead like, and the camera just keeps lingering and lingering on a close up of his face. Finally, he grabs his hammer and surges back to life, more powerful than ever now that he's proven he's willing to sacrifice himself. The moment is painfully cheesy, and yet, somehow, I found myself cheering. [End Spoiler Alert]<br /><br />When it comes downto it, Thor is your basic superhero movie. Even though it's not too original and there's little sense of danger, the characters are eminently likable, the CGI is stunning, and the action is fun. It's a lighthearted film, and  unless you try to follow the mythology of it all, you won't have to think too hard.<br /><br />3.5/5 ¢<br /><br />Most worthless character: Hogun, the token Asian Warrior. All he did was repeat what the other characters were saying in a much more ominous, Asian-y way.<br /><br />Check out more reviews on thenickelscreenven though it's not too original and there's little sense of danger, the characters are eminently likable, the CGI is stunning, and the action is fun.

B002NEFL8W|5.0|I really wanted to get one of the aftermarket grips for my 7D because of the cost, but going on vacation and did not want a screw up so got the canon. Needles to say is is perfect and works great and Amazon got it to me on time and as advertised and cheaper then most all others. Get all canon you will not be disappointed.
1401310672|3.0|I like this book but I personally felt that the website had funnier posts than the book. But it's still funny! :D
0316743003|4.0|Ben Rich's memoir primarily consists of his tenure running Lockheed Martin's secretive Skunk Works unit and the creation of the first stealth jet, which became the F-117.  Although that is the major focus, Rich also touches on Skunk Works' creation, its founder and original leader Kelly Johnson, and some of of its other important work such as the U-2 and SR-17.  You will likely be amused by Rich's tales of interacting with the government and some of its secrecy requirements.  Another great story was that the SR-17 was actually the RS-17, but President Johnson once said it wrong and so the designation, and all the accompanying paperwork, was changed.  Sprinkled throughout the book are \\"other voices\\" from individuals in the Defense Department and the service branches offering some perspective on the stories Rich has told.  Some other commenters noted that the book reads as though Rich is demonstrating why he ran the place better than his predecessor.  Although I felt early on in the book Rich doing a bit of that, I thought overall he demonstrated great respect and admiration for his predecessor and mentor but knew he could not run Skunk Works in the same way (by force of blunt personality and arm wrestling).  Of course, while Skunk Works was accomplishing great things fairly quickly, most of the defense-industrial complex continued to grow and slow down.  Rich touches on these challenges in a conclusion written in the early 1990s that could just have easily been written yesterday.
B001S86J0I|5.0|At one time we had this on VHS but eventually got rid of it for one reason or another. My 19 year old son came home from college and was trying to find the movie, but we didn't have it anymore, so I ordered the DVD version. We've seen it a couple of times already and laugh every time. Big name stars in a comical movie about Star Trek-like actors who find themselves in the real deal. Very funny, very entertaining.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I am so addicted to this game! I drain my battery playing this all day. Looking forward to the update.
0061726826|4.0|What led me to read this book was the amazing reviews I kept reading about it. It only took me a few hours to read and I really enjoyed it. There was one thing I hated and it happened at the very end. I don't want to give anything away so I am not going to say what it was. Other then that, I thought the story was well-written and original. I love the dedication from Lauren Oliver, I thought it was beautiful.    I really liked the world that Oliver created in Delirium, besides the fact that it was terrifying, it also felt so real. The main character, Lena lives in a world where amor deliria nervosa is a very dangerous disease. People who are affected by it experience headaches, sweats, delusions, they stop eating and sleeping, and some people suffer so bad that they commit suicide from the pain. The government has made falling in love illegal, and if a person does not follow the rules (according to The Book of Shhh) then they are tortured and killed. Once a person turns 18, they get the \\"procedure\\"-rendering them unable to have any feelings or emotions and basically live blindly through life, almost like a lobotomy.    I really liked the character of Lena. She was so afraid to fall in love and end up like her mom, who killed herself, that she could not wait to get the procedure done and live her life exactly the way the government tells her to. That's right-not only does the government take away your thought process and feelings, they also tell you who you are going to marry, how much money you are going to make, what you will do for a living, and how many children you will have.  Lena eventually meets Alex, who I absolutely loved! Alex shows her what it means to actually be a person who has their own thoughts and emotions. He opened Lena's eyes to a whole new world, and I loved watching them fall in love.    This story makes you think about love and what it means to be in love. As much pain as love actually does cause a person, it is something that everybody needs.
B000059XUT|5.0|The first computer animated film, has you forgetting that you are not watching a live action movie. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen bring Woody and Buzz to life, taking you inside the world of Toys. A great movie for the whole family to enjoy over and over again! The movie revolves around young Andy's favorite toy Woody and his new favorite (a birthday gift) Buzz Lightyear. At first Buzz doesn't think he is a toy and needs to be convinced by the other toys. When Buzz gets abducted, Woody and the rest of the toys come to the rescue! Woody and Buzz then get lost during when Andy moves, the adventures continue as they try to get home.
B003INBNXO|5.0|Some awesome action in this movie.  I want to fight like that :-)  Definitely worth the purchase if you are a martial arts movie fan.
B00005JLSE|4.0|Stays true to the play while beefing up the story line. All the performances were excellent, especially the supporting cast. Gere and Zellweger will never be mistaken for Fred & Ginger, but the production quality softens their limited vocal and dancing abilities. Worth watching even if you aren't a fan of musicals.
B004X4QW42|4.0|This one isn't as good as the first one but I was still entertained.  Great fight between Donnie Yen and Sammo Hung.
B000065K5S|5.0|**********SPOILER ALERT*******      A captivating film about a young boy growing up in a Maine orphanage. A multitude of subplots involving racism, abortion, infidelity, loyalty, and drug addiction keeps you enthralled till the very end of the film. The scenery and locations, from the Maine forests to the coastline were breathtaking. The acting and storyline held up to the location, and was one of the best movies we've seen in quite a while. Tobey Maguire did an excellent job playing the innocent and somewhat naive orphan, dealing with lifes' issues and venturing out on his own to gain valuable expieriences, only to return to the orphanage as a man to take over the day to day operations, much to the joy of the orphans he had left behind. A FILM NOT TO BE MISSED!
159420229X|5.0|Very interesting read. Entertaining, thoughtful, and educational. I tried the method of loci and it works very well. It has me interested enough to learn how to memorize poetry.
B004EPYZOY|4.0|You have to know going in - this is a bad movie. Of course, it's supposed to be. I didn't expect much, when I plunked down the cash for the 3D movie ticket. I was surprised to have one of the best cinematic times I've had in the last year. The driving stunts are awesome, the acting and dialogue...well, it's what you'd expect from an homage to bad '70s drive-in movies. Gratuitous sex and violence, kick-ass (if unbelievable) action, Amber Heard... This might just be the most perfect guy movie since 'Rambo'.
0446691437|4.0|Very good book from a motivational standpoint on getting things done.  It's about values and focus.  Keeping a drive inside of you and having the focus and discipline to get it done.  Loved it!
0375851569|5.0|I am a huge fan of Dr Seuss and now so are my 3 1/2 year old nieces.  These books are fun and easy to read, they will bring enjoyment to them for years to come  - Great collection!
B004BC7MRM|1.0|Seriously. Terrible. This is not the Kid Rock I started out listening to. American Idol winners have put out better work. If you were ever a Original Kid Rock Fan, don't waste a penny on this junk. Send him a message. We're glad you gave up the drugs and booze, but dude, FUNK it back up. Rick Ruben produced? Has he gotten soft or something? He produced one of the best Beastie Boys albums back in the day. Kid might as well call it a career after this one.
B001AU8ZLK|5.0|I loved X & Y, and I have listened to it innumerable times. However, for some reason, when Viva La Vida came out, I never got around to purchasing the album. However, three years later, I was listening to all my music at work, and a song from X & Y popped up. On a whim, I bought the MP3s from Amazon, and started listening to them. Initially, I was impressed, but not overwhelmed. After a few more listens, I couldn't stop playing it. I keep trying to play other artists and albums, but I keep coming back to this. I was not expecting this at all, but I'm glad that I like it so much.    I ended up buying Prospekt's March, as well, and I have them both playing right now in WMP. Excellent music, and hopefully it is not long before another album of the same caliber is released.
0385751893|2.0|i stated this book with no idea of what to expect apart from the fact that it was about a young boy during the holocaust. In the blub it sounds interesting and exciting, when really its none of them things.   I think tha BRuno and Gretel were really immature and oblivous to wat was going on in the world outside their picture-perfect house. It was quite silly,someof the things they came out with.   Although this is not to say I do not appreciate John Boynes style to portray them as innocent.   Overall, I do thinkthis was a good book but it does not show you enough about the war, and it lacked excitement in some parts.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|Many will try to sell you the SB600 but this little one is more than enough unless you do weddings, and it is very simple. Recommend you learn how to use filter and to diffuse light.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|George Lucas and fans of Star Wars need to realize that these are just movies . If Lucas had realized that he wouldn't of made all this special edition and prequel crap , and if the fans had realized it they wouldn't of fed the money hungry machine that is Lucasfilms . This gets a 1 star from me because it stands against everything that Star Wars is  and that is : a good movie . Now it's just another repackaging in an attempt to get more money out Star Wars . I can understand the movie getting a blu-ray transfer if it ended there it would be fine but no Star Wars has turned into Special Editions , prequels ,  numbered episodes , who shot first and so on . Lucas and the fans have done everything to destroy what Star Wars is : a movie .
1435120027|4.0|No, really. It's lovely. As lovely as a book about a homemade monster can be. The movies all have it wrong. It's such a different tale than the monster glorification in the movies. However, what really makes THIS version are the lovely and well reproduced blockprints by Lynd Ward. It's nice to look at as well as read.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is the first DVD review I have ever felt compelled to write.  I have several DVDs from various trainers, but this DVD is the one that I will go to and actually use consistently.  It doesn't compare to the others.  I am a very busy mom of three, I teach high school all day, and all of the kids are in sports and/or working - it's so much less daunting to know that I only have to find twenty minutes to myself to get this workout in!      I found the workout to be great - I do not really care for Jillian at all, but I do love this workout.  I play my own workout playlist and do the video with the TV sound muted.  It's worth it.  It gives me cardio and strength - and abs, all inside of 20 minutes and if I concentrate and put effort into it, I am dripping with sweat.  I know I can stick to anything for 20 minutes, and I don't feel like giving up because trying to find an hour or 90 minutes is impossible. I will definitely check out other Jillian DVDs now that are similar to this (short but great workout).  After spending so much money to try DVDs and hate them or not like them, I am so happy that I have FINALLY found one that I can use and stick to.
0739376969|5.0|I got this book as a sequel (of sorts) to \\"Made to Stick\\".  Both books are packed full of easy to digest, easy to remember analogies that will change the way you approach problems in the world.  For anyone who is an activist trying to change the system, or a marketing professional trying to get people to see and adopt a new way of doing or thinking, this book is the ticket.<br /><br />You know the old maxim, \\"Change is hard.\\"  These authors break it down and thoroughly debunk that myth.  The only hard part is figuring out how to shape your message and sculpt the critical path for your audience.  If you like the \\"Tipping Point\\" and idly wondered how you might create your own change, this could be the book for you.
0307477479|5.0|No, I perhaps won't be able to convince you to love this book as much as I did (And I REALLY, REALLY loved it). All I ask is that you read it. GOON SQUAD was one of the most satisfying, gosh-golly-wow reading experiences I've had in years. Egan has pulled off a serious high-wire act with this book, pushing the boundaries of narrative structure and stylistic invention while still creating an enjoyable, deeply engaging reading experience. However, it's not just a masterful piece of fiction on the technical/literary level, it is also a book full of sadness, laughter, humanity, and an acute understanding of how time effects (and inevitably undoes) us all.       But don't take it from me. Read it yourself.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Game is simple but is a lot of fun hope the update comes soon. This is suppose to be the week.
037571457X|5.0|The book was quite good.  I had heard of the movie, had not seen it yet, but the format in which it's written is quite interesting.  The pictures enhance the writing style quite well.
0545123275|5.0|I was amazed by this book. I randomly picked it up at the library and found a new favorite. The intimacy you get with the characters is something that takes most authors a few books to develope, but that Shiver did very quickly. I felt so much for Sam and Grace. When they smiled, I did, when they were sad, so was I. I feel like this was a book that all ages could relate to and enjoy. Now I must read the next, I am hooked. Definately a new fav.
014241543X|4.0|This book was heartbreaking but I really liked it. Mia's story of the tragic loss of her family and the choice she has to make between going with them and staying behind was emotionally wrenching. I went into the book expecting an interesting read because so many had recommended it to me, but wasn't prepared for how much I actually liked the book. I loved Mia's family and her relationship with them; it's great to read about a teen who actually likes her parents and even enjoys spending time with them rather than being full of too much teenage angst (maybe I was a nerd, but I was pretty okay with my parents beyond the typical teenage arguments). The writing was wonderful and kept me turning page after page (well, metaphorically I guess, since I read it as an ebook) and I read nearly the whole thing in one sitting. If I Stay is a great example of good contemporary YA lit, but will appeal even to those who don't read a lot of YA (I've only recently begun to venture into the YA section of the bookstore myself).
B001AUEMFS|5.0|Viva la Vida is probably my favorite song ever.<br />Coldplay has plenty of talent (and a cool band-name too)<br />I hope they crank out more like Viva la Vida!!
B004NSULHM|5.0|The moment I heard Lotus Flower, I knew I had to get this record.  It's such a masterpiece, it blew my mind.  Now, I know some don't love the experimental sound of The King Of Limbs, but it's just as much Radiohead as their less experimental output (and I aboslutely love it).  This is more Kid A than Ok Computer, and not every fan loves Kid A either (I love Kid A though).  In my opinion (as well as many others), King Of Limbs is one of the very best releases of 2011.  Furthermore, when the dust settles, it will be considered among the greatest of Radiohead's near-flawless catalog.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|The game is great and highly addictive, the ads can occasionally get in the way but they do go away, especially if you refresh the page. Its already May and im waiting for the May version of Angry Birds Rio, whats going on?
B0034G4ORC|5.0|This movie while like Independence Day involves a Rise from the ashes it defers greatly. In this movie in is from the ground forces point of view instead of a pilot and scientist. In my opinion it is the most realistic alien invasion movie I have yet seen.
0061537969|4.0|I probably would not have gone for this book, but my 21 year-old daughter read it and liked it, and I like to read what she's reading if it seems anywhere near my strike zone, so I took a shot.  This is a decidedly middle brow tale of a man (and his dog's) struggle and heartache.  Funny at times because of the dog, sad frequently because of the heartache, the book is chock full of new age wisdom from the thoroughly anthropomorphized canine.  While at times the book felt trite and at others heavy-handed, the truth is it still got to me.  I got choked up at certain points, and whipped through the whole book quickly, wanting to know what would happen next.  I'm a dog lover, and that (as my daughter no doubt knew it would) clinched it for me.  Viva Enzo!
B004OBQDH0|5.0|Doby is terrific.  A little larger than I expected and very well done.  He sat on my desk for a while and made me smile.  He is now settled in on the mantel along with the loot I brought back from Harry Potter World in Orlando.    The film was a wonderful surprise as I didn't get to see it in the theater. The director/screen writer did not add anything to the story to boost his ego and managed to insert important details left out of previous films to make the story hang together.  Was the best film version of the books since the first 2 movies.    For some reason, film makers still insist on equating dark deeds with a dark screen so parts are difficult to make out but it's not as bad as I feared.     Overall, I'm extremely pleased with both Dobby and the film and feel I got good value for my money.
0060837020|3.0|Not sure if I like it or not.  Seems a bit pretentious - oh look and see how mad I was and don't you think I'm good.  This goes against critical opinion but it does seem a bit teen-agish angst.
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|Long novel to get through. A lot of action. But ultimately, I'm not sure I'll want to read more about Jack Reacher.
032147404X|5.0|I was having problems getting good photos from my DSLR.(Operator Error) I was having problems with exposure and white balance. After reading this book I realized how many other factors go into getting good photographs. There is a lot of good information, in an easy to understand format. I will be getting the 2nd and 3rd versions of this book also.
0316056863|5.0|Loved this book. I am a Tina Fey fan and really enjoyed her writing style. Found myself laughing out loud many times. [Even in public..whoops!] I also found some of the bits informative--when she would wrote about the creative process at SNL or 30 Rock. I also really appreciate that it was a book of anecdotes and stories rather than a year by year memoir. Highly recommended for a quick, fun read!
1936719010|5.0|I don't write a lot of reviews on here - but for this book - I had to take the time to write one.    This book had a profound impact on the me.  I feel like my past failures were explained.  I feel like my past successes were explained.  I feel like, for the first time, I truly understand why I quit nearly everything I start and why I can feel invincible in my endeavors one day and completely defeated the next - and I feel equipped to do it differently now.     It is going to sound fake but it isn't -   since reading this book:  I have stuck to my diet  I have taken on some major clients/projects at work  I have watched a LOT less TV and have determined to do what it takes to get my work done for the day  I have been able to defeat the dragon more consistently than ever before.    I am SO glad I read this book.  SO glad.  This book ranks up with a handful of books that I have read in my life as LIFECHANGERS.  This one has been a catalyst for me.  You may not have the same experience - but I honestly want to tell everyone I know - Read this book.  And then read it again. I am going to have my 17yo read this book over the summer even thought it has some profanity which I am not thrilled with.  If it didn't have it - I would have my 11 year old read it as well. Instead, I will just teach him the concepts within the book. They are going to help me in my business this summer and I want them to learn these principles and to master the ability to DO THE WORK.
B003YFIUW8|1.0|If I could give this book zero stars, I would. I purchased it based on multiple recommendations and was sorely, sorely disappointed. I started the book in February and didn't pick it up again to finish until I told myself that my reward would be to get to read Tina Fey's book. I found the writing style really annoying--the whole \\"point of view from a 5 y/o\\" got old really fast. And even on that same note, I don't think the child's voice was totally accurate. I hated that everything was turned into a proper noun and the constant harping about breastfeeding. Ugh, we get it! The story got exciting at one point, but then quickly went back to tedious and not believable. Some parts moved too slowly, some developed too fast. The family dynamics and background story don't seem to fit very well either.
B004G600A4|5.0|This movie is beautifully told and deals with the not so pretty details in a very easy to understand way. I loved that she is smart and able to do anything she sets her mind too and is not in any way a damsel in distress. She can take care of herself that's for sure and I think that's a super strong role model for any little girl! I love the songs and music especially during the lanterns.. it's so beautiful it reminded me of the Little Mermaid in a lot of scenes and had all the makings of a classic Disney Movie on the order of the Lion Kind, Beauty and The Beast, it's perfect for girls and boys alike too. It has some particularly touching moments where the lead characters go into detail about their unique pasts and gradually fall in love with each other, they don't just get married and ride off to a castle for the sake of it, not that there is anything wrong in that..just saying. I was torn about the Mother Gothel Character, I was glad that Rapunzel was free of her no question, but I don't like that she died, I would have liked, for Rapunzel's sake to see her maybe change and realize she really does love the little girl she raised from a baby.. it is as Rapunzel says \\"Complicated\\". It's hard to stomach that all she really was interested in was the eternal youth that Rapunzel's magic hair provided.. but the story ends on a high note, a still very young Rapunzel will have the rest of her life to live and her real family back to get to know and love all over again, all in all, this is arguably my new favorite classic Disney Movie!
B003DWC6LI|5.0|I loved this book from start to finish for a list of reasons, so here they are:    1) Bridget is every woman: When I creased up laughing at parts of this book it was because the same thing happened to me at some point in my life. Helen Fielding did an exceptional job of capturing the essence of what it is to be a woman in the modern world, so it's not only entertaining, it's a highly insightful novel.    2) It's a great homage to Jane Austen's Pride and Predjudice: The social satire, the shakey romances and the hiarchy of modern society were all perfectly represented in this modern day version. She also managed to get Collin Firth in there and the BBC's adaptation - bonus points for that!    3) It is an epistolary novel that works: There aren't many letter or diary forms of novels these days, or not many that actually work. This one is a rare find for it's writing style, I don't think I've seen one work this well since Laclos'.    Overall a great read with some great features that make it unique.
B000063Y8F|3.0|It's what I expected, but it says \\"Made in China\\" on it.  The Amazon description of features is wrong.  The description says \\"Made in USA\\".  I was disappointed, since I thought they might have started making them here.  I hope they have better quality control than most other products made there.
0525423273|5.0|It's been a long time since I've cried so much whilst reading a book. Stephanie Perkins writes in a way so realistic that you can't do anything but experience the whole journey right along with Anna and reminisce about your own memories of friendship and love.    This novel has the perfect blend of humour, heartbreak, love and normal teenage school conflict. Anna and the French Kiss made me giggle a terribly huge amount. I read it on my flight to Italy, so it was either very funny or I was very delirious from the lack of sleep - I'm thinking both? Anna's thoughts are spot on and perfectly represent what most girls are thinking when they're around really sweet and really cute guys. *wink*    Etienne St. Clair is possibly the coolest fictional character ever. Born in San Francisco, raised in London, currently going to school in France...hell yes. British accents and the ability to speak French = serious hotness. He and Anna become best of friends and the developments in their relationship are fascinating to read about. It seems that they take one step forward, three steps back, and it's an exciting game of 'When Will They Get Together?'.    There are a few heartbreaking/warming moments in this novel that hit the nail on the head and really touch your heart. While I was reading this, I couldn't believe how it so perfectly echoed my past and current thoughts. Anna's character was so relatable and adorable so you're easily invested in her life. You never know how the characters will behave next - prepare for a quick read as you'll be rushing to get to the end!    This is a magnificent novel that you need to read right this moment. Anna and the French Kiss is a beautiful story about love, heartbreak, friendship, enemies, making mistakes and fixing things again. Fall in love with Etienne or else I'll lock him away and keep him to myself!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|The Kitchen House was a great read!  I finished it quickly as I was curious to see how everything would play out.  This one was recommended to me by a friend and I will also be passing the word along for others to read it a well.  Hope you enjoy it as much as I did!
B004SUDQ8Q|5.0|I never heard of this \\"Rabbit Proof Fence\\" before. I have friends who live in Australia and never once did they mention this either.  This story is like a story that has been swept underneath the carpet and when  people see this movie they will understand why...there is great shame in this movie.  Where there is shame, there is courage and love.  It shows strength yet  trepidation.  This movie will move you deep down to your soul. It's hard to say when children are involved that you won't shed a tear...I shed many...some for sadness many for joy.    This movie is one the entire family should watch together.  It has many messages throughout that opens up dialoug for you and your children.  It's a well done movie.  Kudos.
B000I5XDXS|3.0|So many reviews said this DVD/BD was great so I bought it.   I had no issues with the band, the music, and the video production.   My only criticism is that the audio mix was very flat and left the music feeling lifeless.    Even my wife commented on it saying, \\"it sounds like there is a sheet covering the whole thing.\\"    We have a great setup with Pioneer decoder, Emotiva discrete amplifiers and Destination Audio towers with Velodyne subs.   We quickly pulled out our copy of Phil Collins' Last Final Farewell DVD just to be sure we weren't missing something, and we weren't.  The audio mix for this Toto DVD is just as good.    After watching it, we donated it to the local library.

B000O76VBG|3.0|This is a very cute toy and my daughter likes to chew on it a lot.  However, the sound is nearly non-existent it's so low.  I don't know if that's typical or if the battery was just low when I received it.  Either way that's a little frustrating for me.

B002ZG98C8|1.0|I like all the actors and crew for their previous work. Machete has the most silly graphic gore and violence, token nudity, and virulent anti-Gringo plot and dialog yet encountered.    I have seen, and enjoyed, some pretty lame films in my time, but this film written and directed by Robert Rodriguez   is just very poorly done. \\"Clerks\\" has higher production standards.    Danny Trejo is a very cool actor, with a great cast behind him. How did Rodriguez make such a waste of time with such talent at hand?
B004LUS390|3.0|I really like this app, such a close port to the desktop version. Easy to use, looks great, awesome. I just have one problem that is somewhat substantial. Whenever I try to export an image from the gallery I get this error, \\"Sorry! The application SBM (process com.sketchbook) has stopped unexpectedly. Please try again.\\" Hopefully an upcoming update will fix this, because other than that issue, this is by far the best $0.99 app I have bought so far.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This edition is a great addition. need May please make available soon. it is already May. also make it downloadable inthe android market place.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|This was certainly a fascinating book amd it was really quite good.  The fact that it is told from the five year old's perspective i think makes the book more accessible, makes it more appropriate for a wide variety of agegroups amd adds to the overall intrigue of the book.  I only have two compaints...one is that sometimes i couldnt tell the emotion of the mother until the author stated it, causing me to have to reread some sentences.  Also SPOILER ALERT         i thought that more time could have been spent in room perhaps developing the mother and son's contrasting relationship with it further.  overall an inventive and intriguing book...if the description sounds interesting to you then i recommend it.
0316056863|5.0|The only people I find who do not enjoy this book are A)men, B)die hard conservatives and C)the uptight book-heads who want deep meaning after every read. I won't say there wasn't a few topics in which I felt there was meaning and advice to it, but overall this book is a GREAT easy ready! I highly recommend it especially if you want a good easy summer book where you don't want to put much deep thought into, and want to laugh out loud! Everything about this book is fun and witty and makes me wish I could be friends with Tina. I can't figure why people would even write in a BOOK review that she is \\"ugly/unattractive\\", as it has nothing to do with a book (looking at you 1 star people) but if you find snl skits like weekend update circa 2004 funny stuff, you'll enjoy this book!
0385491026|4.0|On the eve of her first retrospective gallery showing, painter Elaine Risley reflects back on her life and the troubled relationship with her childhood friends which created the woman and artist she is now. I have yet to dislike an Atwood novel and that, combined with the fact that I've loved many, is why I so often pick up her work. But between plenty to love and nothing to dislike there's still a gray area for novels I find readable, strong, but not personally as appealing or successful as the rest, and Cat's Eye is one of these. As with most Atwood novels, it's as much a feminist story as it is a personal one, but it isn't strictly a story of men's effect on women--rather, it's about sexism and gender roles in society, and how it effects women and relationships between women. However transparent the focus on these issues, they retain ambiguity and Atwood withholds personal judgement, and so the text never becomes preachy; this somewhat rare, complex, but perhaps familiar view is refreshing and rewarding. Balancing out its broadness is the specific, personal detail of Elaine's life, primarily her childhood and its lingering effects, but covering her entire life and the growth of her art. It's Elaine's art which unites the book: although perhaps artificially reflective of the figures and issues which have impacted her, its rich personal symbolism is not only fascinating, it ties together the book's two aspects and leads to a satisfying, heartfelt conclusion.<br /><br />And yet--while I preferred and enjoyed this take on a feminist history, while I found Elaine's story empathetic and painfully real, and while, as always, Atwood's prose is fluid, wry, and intensely readable--Cat's Eye never quite swept me off my feet. It may be that the book runs long: it's a feminist history, a personal history, near entire and often in great detail, and while it never drags it fails to be tight, sharp, or remotely consise. It may be that the relationship between social history and personal history is more visibility delineated here than it is in some of Atwood's other novels, without being as successful or iconic as something like the blatantly feminist The Handmaid's Tale, and the effect is somewhat artless. Of course, it may just be an issue of personal taste. Whatever the reason, it made Cat's Eye a book I was glad to read but not one that I will need to revisit nor one I love, and that's perfectly fine. There are other books out there for me; meanwhile, I give this one a moderate recommendation.history is more visibility delineated here than it is in some of Atwood's other novels, without being as successful or iconic as something like the blatantly feminist The Handmaid's Tale, and the effect is somewhat artless.

B004SQS9FA|3.0|I thought long and hard about what to say about this record. I listened to it more than a few times, in various ways. I played it through ear buds, nice headphones, my stereo system. I thought about what the group was trying to do and how they ultimately landed. But one problem kept occurring:  I couldn't remember the record after it was finished.  And than it hit me: that's what \\"The King of Limbs\\" ultimately is. Forgettable as anything except good background music.  That's not to say that it's awful. It's not. There was nothing here that made me cringe or angry or any other negative emotion. There was also nothing that excited me, that made me want to hit the replay button. It plays and it sounds good, or good-ish, and when it ends it disappears into the ether, a lot like that the middle section of that Thom Yorke solo record from a few years back. No songs are terrible, and no songs are great either. There is little to no shift in dynamics or moods, and no interesting melodies to dig into it. But it is professionally played electronic music played by a group who could make this record in their sleep.  People who love Radiohead will passionately defend \\"The King of Limbs\\" as a masterpiece, while those who hate the band will find plenty of navel gazing ammunition here. But the truth, to me, is that it exists right in the middle as a pretty decent background record. The band have done better and worse before.  So should you buy it? If you love Radiohead, yeah, you probably should and already have. If you are a casual fan, however, I am fairly certain that you can let this one pass you by and just listen to your old copies of \\"OK Computer\\", \\"Kid A\\", or \\"In Rainbows\\".
0385341679|4.0|I almost gave up on this series...  I was tired of books that seemed more like chapters of a story, and waiting years to see any forward movement in the plot...<br /><br />Well, this conclusion is like two or three \\"-fever\\" books in one, at nearly 600 pages length!  And things definitely move along, plot-wise... but in an amazingly convoluted way.  It does keep the suspense up and things are certainly concluded in a satisfying way--although some mysteries are never quite revealed.<br /><br />I think this book and all the previous ones in the series could have benefited by some tighter plotting and editing.  Even this huge book could have used that.  However, fans of the series will be happy with this roller-coaster of an ending.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Its almost half way through may and the may section isn't out yet what's going on?? Love the game besides that
0553386794|3.0|Amazingly, after 720 pages, this is not a complete book! I kid you not. It is merely a long setup for the next book and likely the one after that. As a stand alone read, however, it is mightily disappointing. There is no completion of any of the main story lines. Now I find myself torn, do I read on or cut my losses? I'm leaning towards the latter as there is also a lack of reward to the reader throughout. You will follow character's for chapters on end only to have them die at a moments notice. Or worse, the book ends before the author returns to the character or storyline. And the author spends endless pages describing past histories of so and so this and so and so that. It's all a bit tedious and makes for one frustrating read. All that said, it has it upside too. Generally well written. Some characters are well developed and interesting. And parts of it are engaging. Like I wrote previously, I'm truly torn!

160059672X|5.0|I've been doing bead embroidery for several years now, and I own a great many books and magazines on the subject.  Of all the artists whose work I've seen, nobody inspires me like Sherry Serafini.  Her designs speak to me as no other artist's do.<br /><br />I've never had the opportunity to take a class in bead embroidery, but I feel as though I've learned a lot from Sherry just the same.  \\"Sensational Bead Embroidery\\" has taught me how to use rivolis as cabs, something I've always thought about doing but never tried because I wasn't sure how to begin.  The cover alone was educational:  I've owned one of those wavy bracelet blanks for several years, and thanks to this book I may actually DO something with it!<br /><br />I believe that this book would be helpful to anyone who would like to explore the world of bead embroidery, regardless of his or her skill level.  In addition to being a great instruction manual, it is truly a feast for the eyes.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|We were nervous at first before seeing the movie as to whether it would follow the book as well as the prior movies have and where it would be cut off in order to do this last book in 2 separate films.  We were NOT disappointed-man-what a ride!  From the minute it starts you are holding on to your seat and your emotions are in for a roller coaster ride you will not soon forget!  Great film-these actors have literally grown up before our eyes and get more and more skilled in their craft with each movie.
B004L03B3S|5.0|Great story, great acting, great cinematography, and great sound. That means this is a five star film! We need more films like these. I can do without the incest story, I mean that is disgusting but it's very well told! Frankly I'm happy to see a gay movie that is not ending sadly (within this disgusting story) and where no gay characters are dying!!!!
0679457313|5.0|I debated a long time over whether or not \\"The God of Small Things\\" deserved a +4 or a +5 rating. The difference between the two ratings seems rather arbitrary, but it's really not. Giving a read a +5 rating means it was perfectly written, and that it is a must read. Upon many days of reflection, I declare that this novel is in fact perfectly written, and it should be read by all even though it won't be understood by all, which is the unfortunate truth of many classic contemporary world literatures. This happens because many Western readers don't understand other cultures (the strangeness of things written or foreign words). This can cause many readers to feel isolated and disconnected from the narrative. To prevent this from happening, before reading \\"The God of Small Things,\\" one should have some knowledge/understanding of India, the Indian Caste System, and postcolonialism. With a little research and a group discussion with other readers, this book comes alive and leaves you wanting more from Arundhati Roy.<br /><br />\\"The God of Small Things\\" takes place in 1969 in the state of Kerala, on the southernmost tip of India. This is a turbulent time for India because of Marxist movements that are occurring, which threaten to overturn India's caste system. The workers are rebelling while the authority figures (police officers) continue to condone the status quo to keep certain Indians in their place. According to one news article, in 1968, \\"160 complaints were filed against the police for activities ranging from murder, torture, and collusion in acts of atrocity, to refusal to file a complaint.\\" Even though \\"untouchability,\\" as the lowest caste members are described, was officially banned in India in 1950, discrimination continues past that date, as demonstrated by the actions in the novel (which are semi-biographical) and by current events. Another website further elaborates how the caste system is especially present in India's rural areas. The statistics say that there are about 250 million Untouchables and \\"the United Nations estimates that there are 115 million child laborers and 300 million starving people in India, most of which are Untouchables.\\"<br /><br />The setting is very important in the novel because it describes and defines these injustices (how the caste system tears people apart, even in one's family) as well as the influences of religion (traditional and Christianity) on the peoples. Without some knowledge of India's history and current affairs, the setting loses much of its significance.<br /><br />The setting is only one piece to a very complex story and plot. Because of constant shifts in time, it's difficult for the average reader to follow the narrative. The disjointed narrative is important, though, because Roy shows that time and history is not linear. Things that happen in our pasts can launch unforeseen complications in our lives, like throwing a stone in a pond and watching the ripples spread out from the origin point. All of history is connected, and it often repeats itself. Roy shows this and more. She forces the reader to stay alert. This isn't a \\"beach read novel.\\" This is a piece of literature that asks the reader to step outside her or his comfort zone and take a glimpse into someone else's lives, in this case three main characters:<br /><br />1. Rahel (girl) and Esthappen Yako (Estha): fraternal (\\"two-egg\\") twins<br /><br />2. Ammu: their mother, born 1942. Married to \\"Baba\\" (\\"father\\": his real name is never given) and divorced.<br /><br />There are a slew of other important characters, but delving too deeply into them would spoil the story for any who desire to read this magnificent novel and be surprised. Here is a simple list of other characters without any spoilers compiled by Paul Brians:<br /><br />***Baby Kochamma (born Navomi Ipe): Rahel and Estha's grandfather's sister--their grand-aunt. \\"Kochamma\\" is not a name, but a standard female honorific title.<br /><br />***Sophie Mol (\\"Sophie girl\\"): the twins' cousin, daughter of their Uncle Chacko and Margaret Kochamma. Throughout the novel, \\"mol\\" is \\"girl\\" and \\"mon\\" is \\"boy.\\"<br /><br />***Margaret Kochamma: daughter of English parents, former wife of Chacko, then of Joe, mother of Sophie Mol.<br /><br />***Mammachi (Shoshamma Ipe): blind grandmother of Rahel, Estha, and Sophie Mol, founder of the family pickle factory. \\"Mammachi\\" simply means \\"grandmother.\\"<br /><br />***Pappachi (Benaan John Ipe): late abusive husband of Mammachi. (\\"Pappachi: of course means \\"grandfather.\\")<br /><br />***Chacko: son of Mammachi, divorced first husband of Margaret.<br /><br />***Joe: second husband of Margaret, died 1969.<br /><br />***Kochu Maria: \\"Little Maria\\": the tiny cook of the household.<br /><br />***Larry McCaslin: Rahel's American husband.<br /><br />***Velutha Paapen: Paravan untouchable around whom much of the action revolves.<br /><br />***Vellya Paapen: his father.<br /><br />The story centers around the twins' lives and their relationships with those around them, mainly their family members and a few of the servants who work for their family. There are a few key events in the twins' childhoods that define who they become as adults, i.e. the visit to the movie theater, Sophie Mol's visit to India, etc. It's important to note that Ammu and her family come from money even though they don't have a lot left. They are high up on the social caste and interact with their Untouchable servants as little as possible.<br /><br />The plot is really complex with many stories being told simultaneously. The central one, however, is called \\"The Terror.\\" To disclose what it is would spoil the journey Roy takes her readers on to discover \\"truths\\" about family and history. Needless to say, there are choices and decisions in the characters' lives that change who they become.<br /><br />The character development is intense and complex because of the time-shifts. The story begins twenty-three years after the main events with tons of flashbacks and flashforwards in the rest of the narrative. At the start of the novel, the twins are young, just children. At various points the reader glimpses them as adults, how their lives as children ended abruptly (the loss of innocence). Other family members change over the course of time, many becoming broken shells, ghosts of their former, lively, and carefree selves.<br /><br />Arundhati Roy's largest triumph with her character development is her ability to enter the mind of children without compromising their innocence or being condescending about childhood in general. She enters into their thinking in a way that few authors have ever been able to. She does not make them sentimental characters, but instead reveals fierce passions and terrors that bring the twins closer together even as it almost destroys them. These fierce passions and terrors live with them as adults. Some might even say their growth and maturity was stunted because of what happened to them as children. You will have to read more and discover the truth in Roy's magnificent language.<br /><br />Language is both the saving grace and often the most cited failing of this novel. Some describe Roy's writing as \\"poetry,\\" which is how I view it. Others explain that her story lacked focus or that her writing techniques confused them, particularly some of the Salman Rushdean stylistic tricks such as capitalizing Significant Words and runningtogether other words. If this didn't make the reading a little slower for some, the Malayalam words and phrases she uses would do it for many others, although Roy provides contextual translations for those who are close and critical readers to spot these definitions when they are given. Basically, I can't stress enough how important it is to really READ this novel. Like any good poetry, one needs to take her or his time, process a little bit, and then come back for more. I highly recommend taking notes and even insist on multiple readings to truly understand the complexities of the story and language. This is when reading this book in a class or with other people would be helpful for one's understanding. I also highly recommend perusing the Arundhati Roy: \\"The God of Small Things\\" Study Guide after having read the book (hence the second reading recommendation). It's important to read it afterwards because there are many spoilers revealed in the study guide.<br /><br />There are a plethora of themes and motifs found in \\"The God of Small Things.\\" They vary from love, madness, hope, infinite joy, family relations, trust, and regret, to name just a few. They might read simply here, but they are complex and intertwine with all the characters from the twins to their Uncle Chacko to their little cousin Sophie Mol. Everyone is affected by the decisions made by a few. The themes should resonate with all readers, even if you have no experience with India's culture. Who hasn't loved so deeply that they would break all the rules? Just think of \\"Romeo and Juliet.\\" Love and tragedy go hand-in-hand when it comes to classic literatures. And it's not just romantic love discussed in \\"The God of Small Things.\\" Even Ammu's children don't feel they deserve to be loved by their mother and families. They are just never good enough...never white enough.<br /><br />Just like the themes and motifs, there are myriads of literary elements used. This book was discussed in an undergraduate postcolonial literature class taught by Sr. Aaron at Dominican University of California, and for good reason. Arundhati Roy is a literary genius. She uses traditional literary conventions, like metaphors, similes, sycophancy, alliteration, and more to make her writing lyrical and poetic. She also creates her own masterpiece language, inspired by other great authors like Rushdie. I would say only \\"inspired by\\" because she creates her own disjointed rhythms, her own language that is described as being \\"at once classical and unprecedented.\\" Roy's book and writing is truly magical, weaving a story that few will ever forget.<br /><br />The message and purpose of Roy's story is multi-fold. First, she wanted to tell some of the story of her mother's life, who she dedicated the novel to. Paul Brians describes it as follows:<br /><br />Mary Roy is the author's mother, who struggled to raise Arundhati on her own while teaching in the rural village of Aymanam (called \\"Ayemenem\\" in the novel) in southwestern India, in Kerala State. Arundhati left home at age sixteen to study architecture in Delhi.<br /><br />Another reason for writing this novel was to give the readers some history about India, specifically Kerala, which is known for its relative freedom for women. Paul Brians warns in his Study Guide that Western readers should not read the female characters as being constrained. Instead, Roy depicts the women as having been hurt by male domination but constantly fighting and struggling against this dominance with a courage and assertiveness that gives hope to those who are oppressed. Although things can't always end happily, the characters keep fighting for what is right and praying that \\"The God of Small Things\\" will hear their prayers and change will take root. It only takes one person to make a difference in another's life, good or bad.<br /><br />The third and final reason for writing this novel was Roy was partly protesting the South Asian prudery which stands in the way of love, one such aspect being the Indian Caste System.<br /><br />I haven't read a novel as good as this one in a long time. \\"The God of Small Things\\" reminds me of readings from postcolonial classes, such as \\"Heart of Darkness\\" and many of V.S. Naipaul's works. This is a novel that I hope to teach someday, and it puts many other works that focus on a child's perspective to shame, simply inferior writing, such as Jack in \\"Room.\\"<br /><br />Arundhati Roy is truly an amazing writer and storyteller. She was trained as an architect, yet she left this career topursue writing, first as a production designer and then a writer of screenplays, two of which were made into films. Then, she wrote this masterpiece. As far as I can tell, this is her only novel, although she is reported to be working on her second. Even though she doesn't have another novel, she continues to write screenplays. Arundhati Roy is a social activist and feminist speaking out for various causes. She cares about the world and its people, especially those in her own country.<br /><br />Overall, my emotional reaction was tremendous. While reading this novel, I went up and down as if I were riding a roller coaster. When the book ended, I even cried, not from the tragedies that were described but from the passions of the characters and the love-- an all consuming love that is worth any sacrifice. There is a sense of hope that runs deeper than any of the family wounds. I couldn't imagine a reader not feeling something as they progress through this novel, even if it's annoyance that the book is forcing them to think.<br /><br />As I already stated, I recommend this book to everyone. It's a \\"must-read.\\" I do recommend that younger readers wait until they are in college before attempting this novel purely because it is a complex piece of literature. Plus, much of the subject matter is rather depressing, and it might be difficult for a younger reader to get through it all.<br /><br />\\"The God of Small Things\\" is an important novel and everyone should read it because of the messages enclosed in its pages: equality, the affects of religion, and the importance of showing and sharing love with everyone in your life (such as your own family and children). These themes cross boundaries and many of the issues stop becoming just India's problems and reach across oceans as something all peoples can work on despite our differences.<br /><br />The most important thing I recommend to all those reading this novel is keeping some important resources nearby to help with your understanding. I recommend the following websites (Please read my review on another site for the links. Amazon would not let me include them here.):<br /><br />1.

0307477479|5.0|At this stage, I don't know that I can say anything more that's hasn't already been said about Jennifer Egan's \\"A Visit from the Goon Squad,\\" but I'll do the best I can.<br /><br />First and foremost, AVFTGS is a thoroughly original piece of fiction both, especially in how the story is told. However, I will give one caveat: I can certainly understand how this book is not for everyone.  If you like straight-on story telling where the writer takes a secondary role to the story, then I don't think this book is for you.  Egan is to literature as Felini was to film - the creator's unique vision and design is felt from beginning to end, and either you love it or hate it.  With five stars given by the writer, I obviously fall in the former camp.<br /><br />One chapter is told in the second person; another appears as a power-point presentaion.  Some characters you read about multiple times, and follow the progression of their life, and see how they're all affected by time.  You'll see how time both beats someone like a \\"goon squad\\" and heals wounds of the past.<br /><br />One downside for the book (for me anyway) was that I sometimes had a difficult time following the narrative, as the book sometimes has a disjointed feel to it becuase it does jump from the past to the future throughout.  However, I place most of the fault for this with myself, because it's obvious this to me this was a very intricately constructed book written by a brilliant author.<br /><br />In short, I found AVFTGS a masterful novel, and greatly deserving of the Pulitzer Prize it received.
B004R13U6Y|5.0|This is an awesome app.  It does an excellent job of cataloging the PDF files by folder and the read to me function is awesome.  You can have the app read a PDF book to you while you drive down the road.  How cool is that!!!!  This reader is awesome for your rooted nook color or phone.
B004WDRT1Y|5.0|I cannot wait for the 3d bluray version. One of the best Disney productions to date and I can only imagine how beautiful this will be in 3D as will the upcoming BluRay3D Beauty & The Beast.   Folks if you are a movie buff looking for pristine visual of course blu-ray is the way to go... if you haven't sampled 3d at home you do not know what you are missing.. so much fun, different... makes the home theater experience that much better.. I recently invested in a home theater upgrade... for 3d tv consider the Vizio truled  3d ready set w/ 480 hz. WOW & WOW... movies look so great on 3d ready blu-ray... 3d tiles are ramping up with more titles being released.... this is not a gimmick... it is so worth it. Lion King in 3d will be nothing short of breathtaking...
B004G600A4|5.0|My daughter, who's 12 years old, loved this movie.  She was hoping for a copy as soon as it was released. I ordered it for her Easter basket. Even though it's animation, she just loved it and so did her friends.  It's smart, funny and romantic.  What more could you ask for??
B001UV4XHY|4.0|I was pleased when I found out that I could pre-order  Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1.  When I could have bought it four days before I received mine in the mail and a little cheaper.  Needless to say, I was totally disappointed...
B00005OCMR|5.0|Had been looking for a while and the price was ridiculously high. Although the prices dropped this was the most reasonable. Delivery was extremely quick and product was exactly as promised.
B001UV4XI8|4.0|We love Harry Potter in my household and this is a great movie. The Blu-Ray itself was good quality with some neat features but not very kid friendly like past DVDs.
B004G6009K|5.0|As far as the movie itself goes, this is one of the prettiest movies Disney has done. The scenery looks like a painting! The music is fantastic, and really fits with the story line (not like Princess and the Frog where every song seems forced.) The story is fun and clever, and the characters each have strong personalities. I would definitely say it's reminiscent of the \\"golden age\\" of Disney movies (Aladdin, Beauty & the Beast, etc.)    While they do have some good behind the scenes (extended scenes, unrendered clips and storyboards), I did expect to get more with the blu-ray special features like a behind the scenes, director's commentary or a bit about the making of the film. Sadly, we won't see those until the next edition of the movie comes out of the vault. But the movie is amazingly beautiful in blu-ray, so I am content for now. :)
B004P6EQE6|5.0|\\"Younger Than Yesterday\\" is The Byrds at their peak....despite it being recorded during a period of \\"turbulence\\" in the group...Gene Clark had just left (for the second time) and David Crosby was threatening to quit.    Great to have this in its MONO mix. Now we need the first 3 BYRDS LPs (\\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\", \\"Turn Turn Turn\\" and Fifth Dimension\\") in mono.    Every 1960s music fan should have this CD...it's that good.
0470876417|4.0|Good book thus far but wish they had eBook.  An eBook would be useful for Consultants that travel but want to be able to reference information.
B001UV4XHY|1.0|This is a very confusing movie.  The first hour is very disjointed, everyone is around but I couldn't figure out why.  It is obvious this is just a lead-in to make a two part conclusion of the series.  It would have been better to combine Parts 1 & 2 and edit them to make one feature length movie to end the series.  You have to have it if you have the rest of the series and the producers know it.  Look forward to part 2 of movie 7, not as entertainment but as the end of the series.  Finally.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|Got this for my son for Easter. He had been wanting it for a long time. Got him the Three-disc extended Collector's Edition. It arrived very quickly and was packaged well. He was very surprised and happy. The disc's are brand new and he is enjoying them very much. Another great purchase from Amazon. Very Happy!!
B003JSSPSY|4.0|I watched both seasons of this and liked them both.  Too bad they didn't continue it there could have still been many more stories to continue into additional seasons.  But it was ended well closing out the major story lines.
0439023521|5.0|After watching dozens and dozens of videos and reading a ton of blogs about how good this book, and series, was I decided it was time to pick it up and start reading it. I have to say that this book lived up to the expectations that I had for it. Often times when a book receives so much hype it has a hard time living up to it. This wasn't the case for \\"The Hunger Games\\" by Suzanne Collins. Collins does a wonderful job of transporting you into a world that I don't think any of us could imagine happening. You feel like you are there at the reaping and you are pouring your heart out with Katniss at what happens at the reaping. You are then pulled into the Capital with her and Peeta as they are preparing for the games. I was on the edge of my seat and turning pages as fast as I could once the hunger games started. I have to say that this book is excellent in terms of plot, character development, and readability. I must admit though, that I am curious as to where Collins is going to go with the next book in the series. She ended it at an interesting time in the story. I guess that's what keeps us book obsessed folks coming back for more though. If the second one is as good as the first one I will be pleasantly surprised and this series may end up being one of my favorites of all time.    Overall Rating: 5/5
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Im still waiting on my update though..I'm anxious to see the new levels! My daughter and I just love all three, but this one by far has the best graphics and special items.
B004YRGB30|5.0|I have been listening to Christina Perri on YouTube for a little over half a year and have been waiting for this album almost as long. It does not disappoint. You can feel the passion and genuineness of the words in each song. The only problem I have with it is I wish there were more songs =p    With that being said, the audio rip to MP3 isn't perfect. There is a crackle in the bonus track backwards. There could be more throughout the album, but I was doing other things while listening to it and could have missed them. Yeah I might be picky, but I did pay for it.
B004LL1HM4|5.0|This album is the bee's knees. Fantastic sophomore effort. They wisely veered away from the style of thier first EP (\\"Sun Giant\\"), and first album (\\"Fleet Foxes\\"). Don't get me wrong, it worked beautifully on said albums, and I love them to death, but they are moving in the right direction. It's not a paradigm shift in any way, but they changed things up enough to keep \\"Helplessness Blues\\" fresh and new. A truly beautiful and mesmerising second album that is ABSOLUTELY worth multiple listens, especially if you are a fan of the Foxes' previous work.
B003UESJH4|1.0|Let me begin my putting forth my personal biases and prejudices for the benefit of the reader.  I love period pieces, and most things done by the BBC.  I love Bleak House, Pride and Prejudice, and War and Remembrance.  I thought the movie Braveheart was good, but could have remained as entertaining without straying as far as it did from actual history.  I enjoy reading about the Hundred Years' War as much as I do about Dickens' England and World War II. Nevertheless, in terms of my interest in the English Royal family, I do not believe an English Ruler or their relatives have done anything worth reading more than a Wikipedia article about since Queen Victoria died.  That's my opinion, and read the rest of my review under that light.     When I first started hearing the praise for The King's Speech, I had mixed emotions.  My experience with \\"oscar-worthy\\" films is that while I universally enjoy all of them, few ever live up to the hype.  With The King's Speech, I was shocked at how wrong I was.  It is not that this movie is over-hyped. My main problem is that this movie just isn't that good, and I'd go so far to say it reminds me of a poorly directed, poorly scripted made-for-tv movie, something you'd typically find on the Lifetime channel, but with British accents. I'd go so far as say this is a terrible movie that should have been left to the bargain bin at Walmart. But many people seem to enjoy it, so maybe I'm wrong, or the Emperor has no clothes. Let me list my main grievances.      1.  Engaging Characters:  In my personal experience, one thing that causes me to enjoy a movie is my empathy for characters on screen, and from that empathy, I can enjoy their trial and tribulations in overcoming adversity.  I do not demand the characters resemble me in my waking life. I'd probably find that tedious and boring, since I would know the subject matter better than any paid screen writer.  In the King's Speech, the characters we are meant to empathize with in this movie are King George VI, played by Colin Firth, and Lionel Logue, played by Geoffrey Rush.   But really, the movie is so shallow that I wasn't able to empathize with Firth's character, or even Rush's.  Here's what we know.  The King stutters.  That's pretty much it.  The movie's writers hint at the childhood causes of his predicament, but that's immaterial.  Other than for King George being a positive foil to his playboy brother, King Edward VIII, I can't find a reason to really like him.  Maybe some people have a thing for soft-spoken English gentleman, which supposedly creates depth.  It does not for me.  I can't say I dislike him, but too me, I felt he was little more than an poorly drawn English stock character taken out of so many other British novels and movies.  Why would someone enjoy spending two hours watching someone stubbornly wiggle back and forth in deciding whether to confront their public speaking issues?  That's not me, and I couldn't care less if he ever overcomes his shortcoming. But maybe people like the movie because of Rush's performance. Still, I found Rush's character just another cliche in the history of the \\"enlightened\\" working class men who somehow know more doctors, scientists, and academics combined.  Maybe that's why people like this movie.  In Lionel Logue, every person can see how they are equal to a king, because of their personal insight into the human condition acquired by their many years walking the crust of this blue planet, called Earth.  I think that's total BS, so I can't figure out why that would be the reason someone would like this movie.      2. Conflict: What I consider the weakest part of the film can be summed up by a summary of the movie.  The king has a stuttering problem, and a \\"doctor\\" cures him.  That's truly what this movie is about.  The movie had several potential gold mines for real conflict that would have greatly entertained me:  King Edward's love for Wallis Simpson, George's life growing up in Edward's shadow,the royal family as a beacon of hope as Nazi Germany marches over Europe and attacks Britain. These huge bastions of conflict were encompassed into about five minutes of film time. I would have found all these stories far more interesting than what we ultimately got.  What we got was a British actor dropping F-Bombs to rob the Weinsteins of their PG-13 rating and almost another 2 hours of psychiatry sessions.  Well, there were a few minutes thrown in to show how stuttering can have a very terrible effect on your private life.  I intend no offense to anyone with a speech impediment, but your problem is not equivalent to fending off starvation in a concentration camp or battling schizophrenia.  Another thing that bothered me is that I could never understand why George's wife married him, other than the fact he was king.  There's just so little interesting about him.  Maybe for some girls, being rich is enough. But these are nitpickings I succumbed to in order to try and entertain myself, when King's Speech couldn't do that.  The nitpickings have very little to do with why I think this movie is terrible.    3. Waste of a Period Piece: In many period pieces, I enjoy the little insights that give the story life.  In Apocalypse Now, it is the playboy bunnies scene brought in to entertain the troops.  In Shawshank Redemption, seeing the passage of history from Rita Hayworth to Raquel Welsh. These little details bring history alive.  I found almost nothing in The King's Speech that meets this criteria.  If simply listening to British accents makes it a period piece, then just watch the BBC.     Ultimately, this movie could have been so much more, but than again, there are so few negative ratings, maybe there's a joke that I'm the only one not getting.  Maybe this movie is a British joke about Americans.  Perhaps I'm biased because I just don't give a damn about English royalty worship, but I don't believe America's gungho infatuation with English royalty is enough to sustain such a poorly crafted story.  If you like it, good for you.  I'm glad I got to watch this movie for free.

B00005JLWN|3.0|Christian Bale does an amazing job in this movie and the idea behind it is very clever. some of the action scenes seem to be a little too cheesy. but still well worth watching once

B004LUS390|5.0|I've had this for some time from the Android Market and have found it to be the best drawing program available.  As an artist its nice to be able to jot down sketches or create near complete comps from my phone.<br /><br />Keep in mind, as with all graphically intense programs, there is a learning curve but one you fugure out all the tricks through trial and error and some handy vids, you'll realize this is a dollar well spent.
1933492953|5.0|Framed Ink is a great collection of practical wisdom for visual artists and film makers.  I bought it to improve my visual art, and liked it so much I bought a second copy for my film maker friend, who read it twice the day he got it.    It is not about inking techniques, despite the prominence of the word \\"ink\\" on the cover.  It is about composition in graphic novels, films, story boarding for films, and the like.  The figures all appear to be created in photoshop using techniques to mimic comic book style gray scale images.      It has a high re-readability factor.  It is quick and easy to read, because there are obviously a lot of figures breaking up the text.  But careful study of the figures while thinking about what the text explains makes this book dense.  It is a good reference to keep around for what to do when you want to create mood X or atmosphere Y, or when you need help figuring out how to transition from shot X to shot Y.  It also has me watching films and looking at comics much more closely now to see if I can spot the techniques explained in the book.
0756404738|3.0|As most of the reviewers, I really loved Name of the Wind.  I was very excited for this but then when I read it I was left wondering what happened.    This book should not be the second novel in the series, it should be a novel released after the main story as a collection of short stories.    Its reads like that, a collection of short stories.  No real central plot or story, just Kvothe wandering around to different places meeting different people and having random, usually uneventful adventures.      Well written but it started getting hard to finish about 2/3 in.      Problem is, if you read Name of Wind then you'll need to endure this to get to the next book.  So wait for it to come out in paper and buy it then so you know whats going on in the next book and lets all hope there is a plot in that one.
1586487981|5.0|All too often development policymakers tout magic bullet solutions without backing up their assertions with rigorous empirical analysis. This book offers a powerful antidote - instead of rhetorically convenient soundbites, Banerjee and Duflo synthesize a remarkable amount of cutting edge economic research: the authors do a wonderful job of both describing the lives and choices of the poor and illustrating what interventions improve their well being. All in all, I found this book to be both enlightening and inspiring - it's a must read for those interested in world poverty and ways to fight it!
B00021HBGS|3.0|Recently bought these foam bath toys for my 3 year old because he's mad about all things cars/fire engines.  Whilst a good idea in principle, we have a curved tub and it's worth mentioning that they will not stick to a curved tub.  That said, even though we have regular flat tiles, the roads do not like to stick to the tile either.<br /><br />However, he does enjoy laying the roads out on the flat tiles and chugging the cars etc round that way.  He even moves the pieces round the lip of the bath, so does really enjoy the set, albeit not in the way the manufacturer intended.

B004QK5N5W|5.0|This little accessory works like a charm. It does support video out for both the iPad 1 and 2, but only from the dedicated video app, or a few other video services like Netflix. The mirroring feature (which will display everything that is on the iPad--video, apps, home screen, etc.--exactly mirrored on the TV/monitor) is only possible with the iPad 2. All it requires is an HDMI cable, plug one end into the TV, the other into the adapter, and it's good to go. There is even an additional 30 pin port so that the iPad can be plugged into a power source at the same time, if there's ever a need to exceed it's 10 hour battery span. All in all, an excellent way to make the iPad's content accessible for teachers, business presentations, home entertainment, or other group activities. A great and useful accessory for the iPad.
B000SE0OYA|1.0|This is not so much a review of this waste toner pack as it is a review of the Brother DCP-9040CN color laser printer that the toner pack  was purchased for.  The printer had to be repaired when it was still under the 1 year warranty, but a service technician came to my house to do the repair.  Now, a year or so later, after the warranty had expired, it refuses to print.  It's a big heavy machine so I struggled to get it in my car and delivered to an authorized repair shop.  They up-graded the software as per instructions from Brother.  This fixed the problem for a day or two, but then the same old fault message came up.  The next recommended (by Brother) fix was to replace this waste toner pack, which was relatively easy to do.  Trouble is, this replacement did not fix the problem.  The next repair steps will require more purchases of hardware that can only be installed by an authorized repair shop.  By the time I manage to get it fixed (if I can) it will have cost me half the price I paid for the machine in the first place.  In contrast, my little HP ink-jet color printer, purchased long ago at a fifth the cost of the Brother, continues to operate without problems.  And before that, an HP black and white laser printer gave me good service for decades.  Boy, am I ever sorry I changed brands!
B00009NQQO|4.0|My 3 year old is nuts about basketball and absolutely loves this bath toy.  That said the plastic hoop has broken several times - literally opening up and coming away from the suction cups on the wall.  I have tried glueing it, but of course being around water, it just happens again.<br /><br />Despite being 'injured' the toy seems to be holding it's own and will remain on the wall for normal throwing practice.

B000WYCF6Q|4.0|I've used two of these on my Bacchetta Corsa recumbent bike for two years now.  I like that they are small and lightweight.  I don't notice any distortion.    Frankly, the only improvement, mirror-wise, that I can imagine is to perhaps use a hand-mirror (the kind made for snow-mobiles).  That would allow me to always look around easily behind me.  But then again, it would be bigger and less aero-dynamic.    Overall, I'm pretty happy with these guys.

0062060554|4.0|This is an interesting exploration of how we form and hold memories and the impact thy have on shaping our sense of self.  The plot has been adequately summarized by other reviewers so I will not be redundant.  The author does a credible job of consistently telling the story from the perspective of a woman who relys on others for details of her life, be it events from 20 years or 24 hours in the past.  Her narration is flat, frustrated, frustrating and increasing colored by fear and mistrust of the people upon whom she depends.  Although a bit predictable with a rushed and rather unsatisfying ending, the book held my attention. The book raises questions about the use of solitary confinement or other punishments that reduce the dependent individual's world to those ideas and pieces of information offered up by someone else.
B004X4QW42|4.0|I am a Donnie Yen fan of most his movies, but him playing Ip Man is my favorite.  I've been watching kungfu movies since I was ten years old and it's know secret that Bruce Lee was my favorite kungfu star.  I recall the days going to a theatre in downtown Baltimore and waiting in a very long line to see Bruce Lee kick butt.  Enter The Dragon my opinion was the king of kungfu best movie, but I can understand if you picked Return of the Dragon.  But getting back to the topic - Ip Man 2 is not as good as the first one, but part 2 is good.  If the producer(s) could of found a character to play as Bruce Lee than perhaps I would rate Ip Man 2 over the first one.  But in the meantime, if you are planning on ordering this movie you definitely won't be wasting your money.
B0048IMZMG|4.0|It's kind of sad that there are few stars that are role-models which people can relate to them. Taylor is definitely one of them with her lyrics and manners. Speak Now is a beautiful mixture of pure emotions, though repetitive at times it is honest.  From the joyful anti-bullying anthem Mean to the perfect heartbreak song Back to December Taylor brings a fresh take on Country music. Like Nicki Minaj she gains fans from age, profile and gender with her voice.

B004SB60OC|2.0|I've listened to her live stuff on rolling stone's website and the live tracks from the ocean way sessions and this album does not even come close to representing what this girl's voice is capable of.  I think Christina excels when she lets her voice explode, and that doesn't happen on the studio versions of her songs.  I was very excited to grab this album today, but all I hear is blah, blah, blah when I listen to these timid, safe, and uninspired versions of her songs.
0307593495|5.0|I first became aware of the brilliant and brooding Swedish detective, Kurt Wallender, through the PBS Mystery series starring the gifted and talented British actor, Kenneth Brannagh.    Although I am a voracious reader of mystery novels, this is the very first book that I have read by the Swedish author, Henning Mankell.  This novel, The Troubled Man, is the final chapter of the Kurt Wallander series and it does not disappoint.  A compelling read from start to finish!
B004EBT5CU|3.0|OK, I'll admit I like the freshness of Adele's sound, although she really is channelling an older sound.  Its just that not too many artists are given to just honest singing these days.  But I'm getting quite tired of the overexposure that Adele's suffering.  She has the kind of niche sound thats pleasant to listen to every now and then but that can really grate on repeated listening.  One can't escape her anywhere these days, the Mall, elevator, Airport, radio....you name it!  And now she's on Dancing with the Stars!    I frankly prefer Amy Winehouse, Joss Stone and even Norah Jones.  They're just easier to listen to, even on repeated exposure.  Much Ado About Adele!

0345479092|5.0|This book is an easy read that makes so much sense. It also gives you many good advises and step to step tool on all the baby & mother' need. I really liked her approach of writing and opinion( which is somehow opposite of Dr.Sears ideas, who believes a mother shall become slave to her child needs all the time). It did really help me, I still go back to the book sometimes to remember steps in \\" how to calm a baby\\",for example.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|\\"The global economic crisis of 2008 cost tens of millions of people their savings, their jobs and their homes. This is how it happened.\\"<br /><br />Opening of the movie...and screen over to the beautiful Icelandic landscapes and not so beautiful Icelandic bank disaster. The documentary smoothly continues to tackle the recent economic crisis in a structured way, including plenty of interviews with (most of the) key players, uncovering the underlying issues following 5 chapters. Some of the key players refused for obvious reasons, making this documentary still a very strong portrait.<br /><br />Part 1 - How we got there<br />Part 2 - The bubble (2001-2007)<br />Part 3 - The crisis<br />Part 4 - Accountability<br />Part 5 - Where we are now<br /><br />As the documentary illustrates nicely, it might all have looked complicated at the time, but in fact it was plain simple and this movie follows up on the promise to explain what drove this bubble to its expansion and more...Excellent done with great cinematography in between!<br /><br />Investment banks, rating agencies, insurance companies, US presidents, foreign ministers, policy makers, lobbyists, university professors, institutional (control) organizations...all get covered in a clean and clear manner.<br /><br />Worrisome is the realization that very few has been done lately to mitigate the risks to avoid such crisis in the future. Denial is still present and the documentary shows this in a superb way by interviewing some academics and lobbyists with their (documented) conflict of interest in place.<br /><br />Feedback loops are important in any system, which is basic system thinking. The interesting element is that in nature as soon as you remove any feedback loop (or any feed forward loop) from a healthy cell, you end up with a cancer cell. And who wants that really? Applying this system thinking principle to the present situation and knowing that part of these feedback loops are still absent (by ignorance, greed or plain denial), future economic disasters could happen again. Related to this principle it is interesting to know that the planned regulations as promised at the time by Obama (promised before election) are still not in place (now being Q2 2011), leaving the window wide open for future meltdown sequels.<br /><br />The strength of this documentary is showing the plain facts (with numbers!) and matching interviews in which hard questions are asked to key players. Sure this documentary shows perhaps one side of the dollar but it is an important side.<br /><br />This is certainly NOT a Michael Moore style of documentary or interview.<br /><br />Also worthwhile to see are the \\"deleted scenes\\" (under special features of the menu), with excellent contributions of Eliot Spitzer, Charles Morris, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, Gillian Tett, Jerome Fons, Lee Hsien Loong, Satyajit Das, Simon Johnson and Yves Smith.<br /><br />Highly recommended!r plain denial), future economic disasters could happen again.

As far as I'm concerned (my children are her age), she's a Great American Talent and I look forward to as much work as she can produce.  I'm listening to this audiobook, read by Ms. Tina herself, and can't imagine that I'd enjoy it more by reading.  Hearing Tina's words the way they're meant is very entertaining. Looking forward to more; her evolution will be exciting.<br />P.S.  She's very pretty too.

0525422943|4.0|I have not read a book in one sitting in ages until I picked this book up from the library yesterday and finished it at 2am this morning! Gayle Forman has done a magnificent job in this followup to her first novel, \\"If You Stay\\".<br /><br />\\"Where She Went\\" picks up 3 years after Mia's accident and the aftermath of drama that it left in her life and boyfriend, Adam's. This book is interestingly told from Adam's point of view. Adam is now a famous rock star with a celebrity girlfriend, but the past three years has been rocky for him because he never got over his first love, Mia, a gifted cellist on her way to Julliard.<br /><br />Adam is about to kick off a major European tour and is leaving for London from NYC. He has just ticked off yet another rabid reporter and his manager is ready to give up on him. Adam cannot move forward due to the memories and pain caused by Mia's abandonment after a tragic accident kills her family. The anger is holding him back from getting on with his life. His outbursts are damaging both his personal and professional relationships and he finds himself hitting a wall with panic attacks and prescription pills. Adam finds himself walking aimlessly through the streets of Manhattan when he sees a concert poster of his beloved, Mia, in front of Carnegie Hall. He buys a ticket and sits in to listen to her from a remote place. The past is suddenly before him like a Pandora's box and he is almost unable to breathe. When Mia is told that he is in the audience, she invites him backstage and the two spend an entire night seeking closure, opening old wounds, demanding explanations and remembering the bittersweet moments that made up their relationship.<br /><br />What really grabs my attention is the sheer intensity of the romance between these two young people. They met in high school, ran in different crowds, had different tastes, yet left so intense a mark on each other that neither considered it the typical teen romance that fizzles once college beckons. I found myself swept away with them; feeling their sorrows and joys, wondering, as Adam did, if it was possible for them to rekindle their romance or walk away after forgiveness was granted. I felt anxious until the very last moment: would they or wouldn't they? My heart broke for them both and for everything one had put the other through.<br /><br />Gayle Forman writes a truly engaging story from beginning to end.f swept away with them; feeling their sorrows and joys, wondering, as Adam did, if it was possible for them to rekindle their romance or walk away after forgiveness was granted.
