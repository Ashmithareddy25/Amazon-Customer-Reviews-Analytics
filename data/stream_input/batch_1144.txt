B00004RFFI|5.0|I purchased this movie to watch online.  This was my first online movie purchase, and so I thought that playback problems were probably due either to my computer or my internet connection.  I was totally and pleasantly surprised to receive a refund notice from amazon two days later.  Amazon gave the refund and tips for better playback in the future without any request or complaint from me.  What great customer service!
B004LWZVZC|4.0|This is a good historical film, and director/producer Robert Redford put a lot of care into the locales, casting, and research. One does make parallels to today's post-9/11 legal situation, with military tribunals supplanting civilian courts, and the film is slanted towards favoring the latter when a more evenhanded approach might have been better. But much of the film is moving and interesting.<br /><br />I liked the film's opening, which shows Frederick Aiken (James McAvoy) wounded on a Civil War battlefield, followed by celebrations after Robert E. Lee surrendered at Appomattox. Aiken soon is defending Mary Surratt (Robin Wright), the owner of the the Washington boarding house in which the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln was planned in April, 1865. Much of the film then takes place in Surratt's jail cell and in the courtroom.<br /><br />Tom Wilkinson (as Senator Reverdy Johnson of Maryland, whose patriotism is questioned), Kevin Kline (as Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton), and Evan Rachel Wood (as Surratt's daughter) are excellent in supporting roles, and McAvoy is quite good in the lead role. I also liked Wright's often subtle, ambivalent performance, as she tries to protect her son (who conspired to at least kidnap Lincoln).<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed this thoughtful and thought-provoking film.

B004K4IZ3G|5.0|I haven't yet been able to sit through the original it just was too painful.  But this reboot/sequel is very well done.  It's tasteful in it's language and portrayal of people - very family friendly.  The music is gorgeous, the story is solid and the characters a likable.  I really enjoyed the acting and felt like the casting was very well done.  All in all, one of my favorite movies of 2010.
B004P6EQE6|5.0|One of The Byrds' seminal albums (post Gene Clark) \\"Younger Than Yesterday\\" has withstood the ravages of time better than many other contemporary albums released at the same time and better than some of The Byrds' other albums. The songwriting team of McGuinn & Hillman were hot at this time and the lead single \\"So You Want To Be A Rock 'n' Roll Star\\" is the first bullet fired in a volley of terrific songs.<br /><br />The mono edition of the album has never been released on CD before and for some of the tracks here the mono versions of songs are punchier than their stereo counterparts; the lead single \\"So You Want To Be A Rock 'n' Roll Star\\" benefits from the mono presentation in particular more than holding its own against the stereo version. Crosby's \\"Mind Gardens\\" likewise is a very different experience in mono from the stereo.<br /><br />Certainly the soundstage is quite different and fans of the album will find this edition a unique experience that equals the stereo and provides a nice, fresh alternate to the original stereo edition that appeared on CD particularly compared to the more contemporary mixes from the stereo (which were done with taste and flair but still differ from the sound of the original mixes here).<br /><br />The original mono mastertape which hasn't been touched for nearly 30 years was used for this edition. Steve Hoffman does a fine job of turning on the tapes and just letting them run. Fans should note however that you do get a warts and all approach whenever Hoffman masters stuff as he believes in minimal to no changes when it comes to remasters as he wants to capture as much of the experience of the original mastertapes as possible.<br /><br />If you're a Byrds completist the mono version of \\"Younger Than Yesterday\\" IS essential. It's a pity that Sony when they reissued this on CD over a decade ago didn't release it with both the stereo, mono versions along with bonus tracks much as they did for the later \\"Sweetheart of the Rodeo\\" reissue (the 2 disc set not the 1 disc that preceded it).<br /><br />Recommended.(the 2 disc set not the 1 disc that preceded it).<br /><br />Recommended.
1400052173|5.0|This book should be required reading for anyone planning to embark on a career science researcher (working with human subjects) or medicine.  Although there is a good amount of scientific information included, it reads like a novel. I was especially impressed with Ms. Skloot's efforts to gain the trust of the family after they'd been so horrifically taken advantage of.  Well done!

B0030Y11XS|5.0|Hello,     Michael Moore has a gift to explain, in very clear terms, the intricacies of the American government and Wall Street (in this case).     As a foreigner, I have difficulty understanding how this nation works, and I cannot thank Michael Moore enough for explaining the dynamics of Wall Street and the back-end \\"deals\\" that result in the news being dished out to the American people on TV.     A lot of the information presented in this movie is disturbing. Every system has some level of corruption, but the large size of the United States combined with the plethora of \\"special interest\\" groups that make up its political system result in a system both volatile and cutthroat.     Thank you again Michael Moore. I cannot respect enough someone who speaks his mind without fear of repercussion. A+     Best,   Charles D.

B0002ADY0Q|5.0|Uriah Heep was my all time favourite back in high school.<br />'Look at Yourself' (\\"you've got a friend, just look at yourself\\")<br />the album was my intro to the Heep. I was to discover 'Salisbury'<br />next and was in love again! The title track was so different than<br />the usual 3 chord, 3 minute pop songs of the day. Simon the Bullet<br />Freak, The Park and Lady in Black all made for a worthwhile purchase.<br />Today I own 3 of the expanded editions. 'Demons and Wizards' rounds out<br />my current collection.

B0009IOR6Q|5.0|What a hidden gem!  This is an incredible 50s musical comedy that will go down in movie annals.  I never knew Johnny Depp made such a classic 21 years ago...long before his \\"Pirates\\" collection.  Baby-boomers, rock n' roll enthusiasts, and be-bop, doo-wop lovers will etch this film into their hearts, souls and minds forever.  It's hilarious, heartwarming and a musical masterpiece.  Someone needs to resurrect this movie magic on the stage.  It will be another \\"Jersey Boys\\".  All 5 stars!  Don't miss this...and get ready for some side-splitting humor!

0143038095|2.0|The Joy Luck Club was not the best book I have read. It wasnt bad, but it could have been better. I think Amy Tan intended any mother, or more likely a daughter to read this book because it shows the strong bonds between them. I did like the way the book ended because it wrapped up the separate lives and showed how they connected in mother-daughter relationships. The title of the book is a good one because it is the central idea of the stories. The club is what ties all the stories together and keeps the relationships of the women and their daughters together. The most interesting part of the book for me, was the story about June's mother and how she fell overboard off of a boat with her family. She got picked up by another boat and dropped off on land, and she was very scared. It was suspensful and exciting to see how she was goin to get home. If she had never found her family again, June may not have even been born. The kost interesting part of the book was when the women told the story of how June's mother got to the United States. She had to carry her two babies through the streets, and she eventually had to leave them in China because the war and all the hardships she had to go through were too much for her to handle. Tan's style of writing was a bit confusing, but interesting. She used a lot of flashbacks to storytell, and she wrote in a way that made the novel exciting and informative because I learned a lot about Chinese and American culture, and how to adjust to a new style of living.
B004K00NEO|4.0|I've loved this movie since it came out in the theaters. I had it on dvd till someone took it and did not return it. I hunted and hunted for this move on blu-ray,since they have better picture quality.   I was not disapointed! Great movie Great format!
B001L63JC8|1.0|These new stereo mixes are terrible.  There is just way too much brought into the picture, and you'll hear additional vocals and instrumental parts that add nothing to the overall picture but clutter and obviously were supposed to stay buried in the mix from the get go.  One glaring example is \\"Back In NYC\\" where there's totally different background harmony parts, and missing effects that were on the original.<br /><br />The original mix of the album was fine.  There's no need to make changes to one of their best albums this late in the game.  Find a version with the original mix, the way it was supposed to be heard.<br /><br />As far as the album itself of course it is legendary and should be a staple in any prog or classic rock collection.  It's got one of the most twisted and obtuse stories in the concept-album cannon and read through of the story in the liner notes is definitely recommended.  Disc one is great the whole way through, and the feel is more direct and to the point than on their previous albums.  Though it does really lose a lot of steam on disc two, overall the majority of the material is fantastic.  Again though, find an older version and you're set.<br /><br />Key tunes \\"In The Cage\\"  \\"Lamb Lies Down On Broadway\\" \\"The Colony Of Slippermen\\"
B004BLTNJI|5.0|I have this in DVD 3d red and blue glasses,and now in Blu-ray 3D. Of these 2 ways I highly reconmend the blu-ray 3D it is so much more in this foemat. and if you dont have a 3D tv then i reconmend the regular blu-ray the colors are just so much better than the dvd.  The movie it self is really good.
B000TX7B5U|5.0|I will start off by saying that I hate System of a Down, it was because of Serj's annoying voice but for some reason, his solo work is amongst the best music I have ever heard. He is incredibly talented and has a great vocal range...  1.Empty Walls 10/10: Amazing  2.The Unthinking Majority 2/10: The only song I don't like  3.Money 7/10: Pretty Good  4.Feed Us 9/10: Really Good  5.Saving Us 7/10: Pretty Good  6. Sky is Over 9/10: Very catchy piano, really good  7. Baby 8/10: Great vocals, really good  8. Honking Antelope: 8/10: Odd song title, great song  9. Lie Lie Lie 10/10: Amazing Song, great vocal range  10.Praise the Lord and Pass the Ammunition: 6/10: Musical talented song, not crazy about the vocals  11.Beethovens C***: 8/10: Really Good Song  12. Elect the Dead: 8/10 Great Song  This is my opinion, overall I will give this album a 9/10 or 4.5/5 for some great songs and two songs that are not so wonderful :)  I would not give this to a SOAD fan because his voice is a little different and some people will think that because he still talks about politics that he's turned his back on SOAD, btw I hope SOAD doesn't work out so well so Serj can put out more music like this and on his \\"ELect the Dead SYmphony\\" CD and DVD. I highly recommend both of those products. Good Day to All
0517548232|5.0|I am fascinated by economic theory, even if, when reading economists, I often feel like a little kid \\"walking\\" a very big, fast-moving dog. I'm just hangin' on for dear life! Not so with Hazlitt: He makes complex economic theories make sense with reasonable analogies, vocabulary that a layperson can comprehend, and, quite frankly, an obvious respect for his reader's intellect that is so sorely missing from so much economic writing. I'm offering the highest praise when I say that Hazlitt makes Thomas Sowell seem lofty and difficult to understand. And incredibly, Economics in One Lesson, which is a classic in its own right, reads like a book that could've been written last month. This book is a gem.
141690977X|5.0|This book was not only funny and entertaining, but really had a lot of truth to it! I enjoyed reading it and will read it again and again.  It makes you think and helps you to feel hope for the future.  This book is currently being  passed around all of my friends in high school and we are all writing \\"standards\\" that you are asked to do at the end of the book.  All of the standards are beng copied and kept together for others to read! I think this is a great high school, college, and adult read!  Enjoy =)
031236198X|4.0|A nice fable about organizational culture change. the book provides a sequence of things to do for change which also needs leadership. also very importantly, a framework is given, which the change agents can use for their own organizations. if you are considering a change in root culture, read this book, going to help too much.
0091493714|4.0|As the title suggests this is a book about negotiation. The main premise is that besides the two classical approaches to negotiation: soft or hard, there exists a third way that is neither hard nor soft. As the authors best frame it: \\"There is a third way to negotiation, a way neither hard nor soft, but rather both hard and soft. The method of principled negotiation development at the Harvard Negotiation Project is to decide issues on their merits rather than through a haggling process focused on what each side says it will or won't do. It suggest that you look for mutual gains whenever possible, and that where your interests conflict, you should insist that the result be based on some fair standards independent of the will of their side. The method of principled negotiation is hard on the merits, soft on the people.\\"<br /><br />After presenting this central idea, the book then goes into more details as to the issues that arise when using traditional negotiating strategies of positional bargaining. Then it goes on to address four main concepts for successful principled negotiation: separate the people from the problem (people), Focus on interests, not position (interests), invent options for mutual gain (options) and insist on using objective criteria (criteria). Finally the authors attempts to answer/provide further guidance in situations where the other side is more powerful, if they won't play or if they are using dirty tricks. In doing so, one more fundamental concept is presented: BATNA. \\"The reason you negotiate is to produce something better than the results you can obtain without negotiating. What are those results? What is that alternative? what is your BATNA - your Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement? That is the standard against which any proposed agreement should be measured. That is the only standard which can protect you both from accepting terms that are too unfavorable and from rejecting terms it would be in your interest to accept.\\"<br /><br />Below are some additional excerpts I found particularly insightful:<br /><br />-On Perception: \\"Ultimately, however, conflict lies not in objective reality, but in people's heads. Truth is simply one more argument - perhaps a good one, perhaps not - for dealing with the different. The difference itself exists because it exists in their thinking. \\"<br /><br />-On Focusing on Interests, Not Positions: \\"Negotiating hard for your interests does not mean being closed to the other side's point of view. Quite the contrary. You can hardly expect the other side to listen to your interests and discuss the options you suggest if you don't take their interest into account and show yourself to be open to their suggestions. Successful negotiation requires being both firm and open.\\"<br /><br />-On Inventing Options for Mutual Gain: \\"To invent creative options, then, you will need (1) to separate the act of inventing options from the act of judging them; (2) to broaden the options on the table rather than look for a single answer; (3) to search for mutual gains; an (4) to invent ways of making their decisions easy.\\"<br /><br />A great book on negotiation, that is filled with practical advise. The authors illustrate their methodology through numerous examples/situations from a wide variety of fields (politics, economics etc.). If I had to have only one book on this topic, this would be the one!/>Below are some additional excerpts I found particularly insightful:<br /><br />-On Perception: \\"Ultimately, however, conflict lies not in objective reality, but in people's heads.

B004G6009K|5.0|The film is incredible.  Beautiful animation and design.  Fun story and memorable characters.    Why you should pick this up is because currently this is the best 3D film for the dollar.  If you don't have a 3D blu-ray player and 3DTV, don't worry.  The set includes the standard blu-ray and all the extras.  If you do happen to have a 3DTV then give the film a shot.  Even adults shouldn't be disappointed in this fun Disney flick.

Well written, and semi objective.<br />I especially liked the investigation about the conflict of interest in academia; makes me scared that those types of people are teaching are future leaders.<br /><br />PS: It doesnt star Matt Damon.

B0041KKYEW|5.0|I am delighted Natalie Portman so rightfully was awarded all the accolades for her phenomenal performance in \\"Black Swan\\".  The story was brilliant in its portrayal of the price exacted by the preparation for perfection, the drive to achieve such personal and professional ambition, and the complexity of human relationships--both real and imagined--involving inhuman expectations both internally and externally, with such intense conflict on so many levels.  The writing, directing, acting and editing so seamlessly,accurately, and sensitively depicted the interplay of reality and psychosis when dreams become obsessions and lead to ultimate self-destruction!
B001KO3VKG|1.0|This is the worst pedal I have ever played. It colors my sound even when all sliders are set level. It is extremely noisy, again even when set flat.    I know what is acceptable, and even for bedroom use this pedal is garbage. I bought it because I figured I'd give behringer a chance with a pedal that in theory shouldn't be too hard to mess up. Well they definitely did. I don't mind the low quality build, if it were to be fairly quiet and usable. But it's poorly built, and radically changes the timbre of the guitar even when the pedal is turned off. First pedal to make me realize how big lack of true bypass can be.     some of my favorite pedals include, Russian Big Muff, Visual Sound Jeckyll and Hyde, ProCo Turbo Rat, Biyang Mouse, yamaha Magicstomp.

B003EY7IRC|3.0|Well I liked it but I'm not sure if I can read it again!!!!<br />I liked Mac since the biginning my issues are with Barrons though.<br />The plot keeps getting thicker and thicker and the characters are evolving (sometimes not in the good meaning). I tried to read the whole series, from book 1 to book 5 straight and I fount it rather tiring. For a book with such a thick plot maybe one should consider to leave an amount of time between books.<br />Generally a GOOD book which needs certain attention.

031603438X|5.0|My five star rating reflects the fact that I am a fan of the Rolling Stones, but even if that were not the case a four star rating would be in order. Richards' excellent memory for details, along with his perceptive and honest account of his life, makes reading his Life altogether worthwhile. Beyond just an account of the Rolling Stones, Life provides a fascinating portrait of a myriad of individuals. Such portraits go well beyond the members of the Stones - from drug dealers in Morocco to his first wife, Anita Pallenberg's artsy circle in London in the late 60's. Whether investigating the relatively obscure, or highly celebrated, Richards (with help of co-writer James Fox) expresses himself remarkably well. He combines insightful character analysis, vignettes, and reflections on any given situation in a way that is not protective of image but rather extemporaneous and often visceral. However, Richards rarely seems to go off on a rant that would bar the reader from seeing other points of view; he provides detail and information so the reader can see things from angles other than his own.                Richards paints a superb portrait of post war England in a town outside of London called Dartford, where Mick Jagger had grown up as well (in the nicer part of town).  From an early age, though, it's obvious Richards is not fitting in at all with this world (or his parent's expectations) and that music was his ticket out. Although he would go on to attend art school, this was really just a cover for playing music. The expectation for an art school graduate was to go into advertising working as a factotum for the advertising executives, \\"Lad, can you get me some tea?\\"-- and clearly this was not Richard's bag. Richards had imbibed all sorts of music as an adolescent; his love for these musicians and their influence on him make up the early part of the book from when he leaves art school to the formative years of the Stones.    The workings of early band dynamics is another fascinating aspect of the book. Who is the one really responsible for the Rolling Stones? According to Richards, the Rolling Stones would not exist if it were not for Ian Stewart, who pushed the band when they were not getting paid for gigs. Amazingly, Stewart was taken out of the lineup for the band early on -- but he continued to tour with them as a road manager up until his death in the early 80's. Then there's Brian Jones case, whose creative potency as a member of the band waned until his death in the summer of 1969. Jone's demise was in part brought about by song writing duties being placed upon Jagger and Richards by their manager Andrew Oldham. As Richards tells it, Oldham had locked Richards and Jagger in a kitchen and he told them to come up with something, and what resulted was their early classic \\"As Tears Go By.\\" Jones lost his way most likely because of this arbitrary pairing. Oldham did not choose the Jagger-Richards combo due to any perceived song writing giftedness on their part, but only because Jones couldn't write songs; thus Jagger and Richards (who were hanging out a lot with each other at that time) were chosen by default. As far as I can tell from Richards account, Brian Jones was musically knowledgeable -- but not a complex character and something of a star struck egoist, who had put celebrity before the work. It's a shame that he died the way that he did, but I was left with no looming questions of, \\"what if Brian Jones had gotten his act together?\\" as I'm not sure that would have changed the course of the Stones history -- at least, for the better.                                  One reviewer has said that the book begins to slow down after the sixties, when Richards enters his heroin-addled years. For me, that was not the case at all. I enjoyed all of the accounts from the 70's. After the death of Brian Jones, the Stones really found their rhythm. I think it would've been a tragedy if the Rolling Stones disbanded in say, 1970, sinceone of my favorite Stones album is Exile on Main Street, in which the band lives as tax exiles in a house called Nellcote, on the French Riviera. From this period on up until the late 70's when Richards `kicks' heroin, there are fascinating accounts of his close shaves with the law -- especially with partner in crime, Texan sax player Bobby Keys, who later got kicked out of the Stones for deciding to fill up a bathtub with champagne rather than show up for a gig. It's this period that is the stuff of reckless and ribald behavior on the part of Richards, where his wife Anita spun out of control and he had to take care of his son, Marlon, on the road for one tour in the mid 70's. Richards has awesome tales to tell from this period and I enjoyed reading about them.         If there's a point where the books begins to slow down for me, it was the last 100 pages right after his \\"taking the piss\\" on Her Majesty, Sir Mick Jagger (which is a personal rant, but there was nothing in this rant that didn't smack me as true). But then, while this part was less fascinating to me than the rest of the book, the last 100 or so pages does provide a rounding out of the Keith Richards character, revealing pettiness (getting upset over crew and security eating his shepherds pie, and then claiming he wouldn't go onstage until they made him a new one) and the side of him that enabled him to write such a good memoir -- an introspective bibliophile living a gentleman's life in a country home in Connecticut. The thoughtful Richards appears every bit as real as his outlaw image which makes up many pages in the book. Together, they form one of the last true legends alive today. It is both a wonder and a blessing that Richards is alive to tell us about his life.

B004H83IFA|5.0|This could so easily have been just a tear jerker--or maye worse--an exercise in indignation.  It's neither. It is about tragedies in a family that, on the surface, most people would envy, but it is done without melodramatics, without larger than life demons.  The bad people are bad enough. The situations all too possible. Brilliant acting and excellent production make this worthy of being owned--and talked a about.

B002UXRGM0|5.0|I am really fascinated by the making of the series and also the narration. Its really worth every penny. I already own the Planet earth series and when looked at the amazon gold deal, could not resist picking this up.  The series basically covers three main aspects : Survival by basically hunting, propagation of the generation and what & how various species overcome challenges they face day-day  One can really appreciate the bluray after watching 10 mins presentation after each of the chapter.   I am really amazed by the effort spent by BBC to enlighten us about various species around us.  I am happy I bought a great series.
B004G600A4|5.0|I enjoyed this movie; really enjoyed it!  The animation is excellent, the production is flawless, the dialogue is witty with just enough laugh-out-loud moments.  A sword-wielding horse?  What's not to like?  I was enchanted by the treatment of how the witch uses Rapunzel's hair to get into the tower and by the use of the secret door.  There is poignancy, also.  After all, how would YOU feel - locked up in a tower for 18 years; being able to look out but never to go out?  Think about that.  Then watch this movie.  You might as well buy it, you're going to want to watch it over and over again.
B004PEJ1H0|3.0|I have been a George Michael fan since his first album, and even though he's releasing albums about every 8 years, I still get psyched for every new release.  With that said I was a little disappointed with this new song.  To be honest it sounds beautiful underneath all the production - there are many layers on this one.  Also, I'm not a fan of the auto-tune and I found it annoying that such a gifted vocalist would drown his vocals as he did - he literally sounds like he's underwater.  For me this one missed the mark.

1594488843|4.0|First off, if you're at all interested in psychology, or the science behind human motivation, or business management you NEED to read this book. This book is a required text for a business management class I'm currently enrolled in. I couldn't be more happy or enthusiastic about a required reading, as this one is interesting, and deeply logical. I expected to have to trudge through this book and i ended up using it as an excuse to not do my other homework. It is such a good read that I had trouble putting it down.

B004Q7E0TA|3.0|I feel a little like the synopsis on the dust jacket lends itself to a let down with the memoir itself. While de Rossi certainly sheds light on the painstaking and heartbreaking rituals of a person struggling with an eating disorder, I wouldn't call it \\"unflinchingly honest\\" or say that she makes the disease \\"transparent as never before.\\" de Rossi admits in the epilogue that while writing this book, she felt \\"like [she] was writing about a different person.\\" I sensed that throughout the whole book. While I don't doubt the validity of any of her stories and experiences, it is clear they were written looking backwards--this book lacked the poignancy of reading about a person in the throes of a disease.     Of course, given the topic of this memoir, de Rossi's story is touching, but I kept waiting to read about her struggles with anorexia. The feeling of her struggling never came. She talks a lot about her rising career in Hollywood (which of course she had to) and then her denial of being anorexic. In fact, de Rossi writes about her compliance with her doctors after passing out in a makeup chair, \\"I can't stay thin. I just wasn't built for it. I wasn't born with thin legs and I can't keep them. For over a year I've managed to maintain my weight, but if I keep up that maintenance to the exclusion of everything else, then I'll have anorexia.\\" Only then.     The epilogue read more as a cathartic, self-reflective diary entry rather than being something that added to the book, although I can't blame de Rossi if that was her point. She also switches to second-person point of view quite often which (here is my English teacher side showing) drives me up a wall--I don't like being talked to while reading: \\"Something has changed from the time before you were sick\\" (emphasis mine). I've never struggled with an eating disorder; please don't address me here.     The snippets about her relationship with and marriage to Ellen DeGeneres are lovely; it's heartwarming to know that de Rossi finally accepted herself with the help of true love.
B004XJHBCE|5.0|We've all had \\"fun\\" with how to best manage files and apps and otherwise just organize the Android.  This is one of those apps that is so powerful, you may not realize at first what it can do.  I now control all my apps, folders, bookmarks and contacts in terms of where they're grouped, how easy they are to access, what they look like, how they sort, etc.  The more apps I download, the more I \\"reorganize\\" my phone easily with this app so I can easily find and remember what I have. My favorite feature is how you can put commonly used utilities in the top menu bar so they pull down no matter what screen you're on. The developer is constantly updating it with quality features and fixes. My husband downloaded it too but hadn't bothered to use it.  I finally had to take over his phone last week and get him organized.  He loves it - and let's just say he had forgotten how many golf and news apps he had because his screens were previously so full of icons he couldn't navigate!  I highly recommend this app but it will take you some time and energy to truly dive in and figure out all it can do!
0385341008|5.0|This book begins in medias res, but then again, where else would an epistolary novel begin? Immediately, I felt as if I were sitting down to chat over tea with old friends-- if I liked tea. Juliet Ashton is a supremely genuine character with a real voice, someone I'd love to know. She is kind and generous, yet spunky--a lovely multidimensional character with good judgement... unlike so many characters we read. The Guernsey Islanders are an interesting bunch eager to tell their story of WWII, a story largely untold even in real history. Shaffer and Barrows certainly did their research on the island, and they present it through writer Juliet.<br /><br />I stopped reading last night with only about 40 pages to go. I never do this; who stops reading with only a few pages left, postponing what happens? Typically, I would forge ahead and finish the book before going to sleep. However, last night, I wasn't ready to leave Guernsey island. I wasn't ready to leave these people who seem so real.<br /><br />I do have one complaint, though I understand why the authors did so. The perspective shift at the end of the novel is a bit jarring. Without giving anything away, I don't see a way around shifting perspective, but I can't say I liked it. It seemed a bit contrived. The ending was also predictable, but it is exactly how I wanted the novel to end. A story like this deserves such a happy ending.<br /><br />Despite these few complaints about the end, I can't imagine giving this book anything other than 5 / 5. It is so well researched, the characters are so well developed, and the story is so interesting, this book is certainly a new favorite. I agree with Elizabeth Gilbert: \\"Treat yourself to this book, please--I can't recommend it highly enough.\\"
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I missed the Firefly series when it first came out, but had seen the movie \\"Serenity\\"  and loved it. From that point I had to see the series, saw it in your inventory and   purchased it and will never regret it. Great series, great service as usual.    Well done  Levi Miller
B003EY7IUY|4.0|'m a huge Rebecca Brandon (nee Bloomwood) and Sophie Kinsella fan! I've been reading this series since... oh, high school? Maybe freshman year of college. Anyway, I was so excited to see a new book in the series.       That being said, it has been three years since the last book, Shopaholic and Sister (not my favorite), so I had forgotten some of the nuances of the story. I hate that it took so long for the next installment. I think this is my biggest complaint about the book.       Becky is back with all of her naive hilarity. Her justifying purchases truthfully hit a bit close to home; I find myself going through some of the same thoughts! The extent to which Becky goes to have things go her way never gets old. Her daydreams are fabulous and her fantasyland is a place I'd certainly like to live.       I gave this book a four because it truly only a fun read; I'm not convinced a true chicklit novel like this could earn a 5 from me. Either way, this is a quick read, great fun, and a definite escape from any sort of reality.
B001BZGA8Y|4.0|This is watch is pretty cool. Says it's for Men, but I think the crystals makes it looks feminine. I wouldn't buy it for my husband but I love it. Have gotten compliments on the watch from both males and females. Love how it has ceramic white detail not plastic! Would prefer a Michele watch but this is a step up for me. You can get it sized in any Swatch watch retailer. Nice watch looks better on females!
B0022Q8CSC|4.0|I did enjoy this book, but found it less substantive than I thought it would be.  I read Omerta, by the same offer several years ago and found it to be more captivating. All in all, I found it to be just okay.

0307577589|4.0|I got this book for a cross country road trip. It's pretty entertaining after they get all the characters developed. There are also a LOT of people to keep track of - which can be confusing at times. However, it doesn't make you lose interest.<br /><br />It's a bit dark and the sexual content is rather graphic. It seems like the author is trying to make a point about sexual abuse. I'd still recommend it if children aren't listening.
0743201140|4.0|In this book, the authors further develop the points raised in First Break All The Rules.  The idea is to identify your strengths and then run with them.  It's those strengths that others value so highly, since others tend to have different strengths.  The big idea of these authors is that we waste time and resources trying to shore up our weaknesses when each of us can contribute far more through development of what we already do best.      As a practical book for management, I think this approach may be limited.  The ideas are sound, but execution of those ideas remains unclear through to book's end.  I don't know how to truly manage others to emphasize their strengths in the actual work setting.  First, I'm not sure what the great strengths are for others and there is no evidence that by using the strengths test tool I can be sure of the results.  Second, unfortunately most jobs aren't so flexible nor management sufficiently resourced with the ability to dynamically redesign jobs based on the strengths of those employed.  The real world is so far from the ideal world.  However, it does seem like a worthy idea to employ the notions of these authors whenever there is a choice.

0385341679|4.0|I patiently awaited the final book in this series and I wasn't disappointed with the ending, it was not what I was expecting.  The biggest shock was the continuation from the 4th book when I found out who was actually killed!    I hope Moning continues sharing her imagination with us, cause it's full of alpha males you want to try to tame, and twisted plots that keep you turning the page to find out what's around the corner.  Have recommended this series to several people and they all got hooked.  It's a great read you'll have trouble putting down.
B004SEVPWQ|4.0|This is a great looking game, and is very smooth and plays nicely on my HtC Evo.  I love all the features and options it gives.  The only reason I do not rate it 5 stars is the lack of choosing your online opponent.  The multiplayer throws you into a room with a random opponent.  I would like to play versus my friends and family members.  When this feature becomes available I will change my rating.
0545128285|4.0|The Tales of Beedle the Bard is a lovely collection of tales that are understood to be told to children in the wizarding world as fairy tales are told in the muggle world.  Each tale is truly original and has a specific moral (much in the same vein as Aesop's Fables) often emphasizing ingenuity, compassion and intelligence as qualities for which to strive.  The real gem of the stories, however, are the commentary written by Dumbledore at the end of each story, detailing the history and/or significance of each story.  J. K. Rowling never ceases to amaze me with her creative and witty writing.  In addition, we are treated to her lovely illustrations in this book, which compliment the stories perfectly.  At 128 pages, it only takes about 45 minutes to read, and its brevity is my only disappointment.  Otherwise, I would recommend this book to any lover of the wizarding world.
B004YNWBZG|5.0|I think that the person who gave this episode a one star, does not appreciate the show as much as a true Smallville fan does. Every show has room for what I call \\"fill in episodes\\". These episodes are not the best, but to a true fan of the show, these episodes are still worthy for a five star. The finale will be the best, so keep on watching and enjoying Smallville.

The taxation of trusts, whether they are income, capital gains, or corporation taxes is clearly explained in `Tolley's Taxation of Trusts' ... and to great effect.  If you need to keep abreast of the latest developments in this area, you'll need this latest edition from Tolley.<br /><br />The bulk of the book's ammunition is delivered in part I - the first 20 chapters - on UK Resident Trusts, which covers the subject in detail, from types of trust, beneficiaries and trustees to starting a trust, running it and ending it.  The detailed ramifications of Inheritance Tax are logically explored and there is a chapter each for Charitable Trusts and Stamp Taxes.<br /><br />There are 3 chapters devoted to the subject of compliance - specifically on income tax, capital gains tax and inheritance tax, with Chapters 18 - 20 dealing, respectively, with the interest and penalty regimes.<br /><br />Part II -- the last 5 chapters -- focuses on non-UK Resident Trusts and should ideally be required reading for all those advising UK families or individuals who either have such trusts or have some connection with them as beneficiaries.  Hutton refers readers who focus on this area to the specialist texts available on the subject.<br /><br />The book contains much new material, the main point of interest being, as the author points out, the election of a Conservative and Liberal Democrat Coalition Government.  This has led, among other things, to two Finance Acts in 2010.  A major new development here, just to cite one example, is the return (from June 2010) to variable rates of capital gains tax.  There's no change, however, in inheritance tax for 2010-2011.<br /><br />These, and all other recent developments, are included in this new edition, from updates of \\"Compliance\\" and \\"Self Assessment\\" to the impact of cases such as Brander on business property relief cases.<br /><br />In addition to all this, the book is a mine of fiscal resources to aid further research, with tables of statutes, cases and statutory instruments, plus 6 appendices and an excellent index.  For specialist practitioners whose clients demand and deserve best advice in this complex field, this latest edition from Tolley is indispensible.<br /><br />Changes in the law have been taken into account up to the end of July 2010 and provide the most definitive and accessible statement of the taxation of trusts to date.\\"Compliance\\" and \\"Self Assessment\\" to the impact of cases such as Brander on business property relief cases.<br /><br />In addition to all this, the book is a mine of fiscal resources to aid further research, with tables of statutes, cases and statutory instruments, plus 6 appendices and an excellent index.

However, if you're a practitioner advising clients, you need a deep and detailed understanding of stamp taxes in all their ramifications, permutations and complexity - which is exactly what a thorough study of this helpful and authoritative Tolley guide can do for you.<br /><br />The author is Patrick Cannon, originally a solicitor who now practices at the Bar is a specialist in this field, and he concedes that `in addition to complex legislation, practitioners have also had to contend with a compliance system of enormous complexity and detail coupled with shortcomings in its administration.' How right he is!<br /><br />Having this guide to hand, however, means you can, undaunted more or less, access all the pertinent and up-to-date information you need to plough your way through the intricate furrows of this admittedly complicated subject.<br /><br />Part I of the book provides a topic by topic guide to Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT), with the chapters arranged in order of subject matter as appropriate for a tax that is applied over a range of transactions. There are no less than 88 chapters in Part II, which covers stamp duties and stamp duty reserve tax, which are laid out in alphabetical order (from Adjudication to VAT and Stamp Duty) for easier reference. Part III features 9 appendices containing precedents and official claim forms - very practical and handy, that! And even handier is the list of Stamp Office contact details.<br /><br />As you'd expect, the extensively cross-referenced text provides refers frequently to recent cases, company law and taxation legislation.  There's a useful list of abbreviations and references followed by lengthy tables of cases, statutes and statutory instruments if you need to do further research, which no doubt you will.<br /><br />This most recent edition is up to date as at 1 August 2010 and therefore includes the relevant provisions of the Finance Act 2010 and Finance (No 2) 2010, plus a wealth of additional new material.  Note here that Tolley's is now introducing online access to best practice, including guidance notes, worked examples and template documents.<br />Be you practitioner, or financial adviser, this definitive guide will help you lend added weight and authority to the advice on Stamp Taxes you give your clients or associates.you need to do further research, which no doubt you will.

0061537934|5.0|I must admit, as a racing fan to the core, I bought this book because of the title. I was not a dog person before reading this, in fact, upon reading the synopsis, I was expecting a disappointment. I won't spoil it, but WHAT A STORY. Not only has it made me a dog person (hah!), there was more than enough racing related content to satisfy me (though not too much to annoy non-racing fans) but I'm sure those who can relate to the F1 references will love it even more. Just finished it yesterday and I will DEFINITELY read this again one day. Again, trying not to spoil anything, but the final chapter completely sold me on this book if the rest hadn't. Very much recommended. READ IT.
B000MGBSI0|5.0|So you've all read the stories about the first season and how it's boring, well the stories are true. It was't until the last few episodes of that season that Melrose Place because Must-See. Season 2 begins with a bang, literally, as Alison's deranged ex boyfriend stalker blows his brains out on the phone while Alison is on the other line. The Michael, Jane Kimberly love triangle really heats up and then they threw Sydney into the mix, making it a 4-some! That was some craziness, they really went really over the top in such a quick fashion that you start to wonder who Michael is really with every episode. And then Kimberly dies...and comes back! The writers knew what they were doing here, making the show sexier, crazier, and better. I loved Kristian Alfonso and Lauren, she was such an uber biotch. I think they should have canned the Matt character along with Rhonda at the end of season 1, it seemed like the was just htere most of the time doing nothing, and his storylines were pretty boring and useless. The season just gets better and better and by Season 3, the end of each episode had so much drama packed into it that they left you wanting so much more that because all felt like Season Finale episodes. Definitely recommended.
B004DI7HZ6|2.0|This book is not on par with those of Kim Harrison or Charlaine Harris.  Rather it is a soap opera written for 14-year old girls.  Long descriptive passage bog the book down in minutia that can be of no interest to anyone outside the romance genre.  The main story, such as it is, is told in fits and starts between those long descriptive passages.  I had to put the book aside several times because I was, bluntly, bored with it.  I returned to finish it only because I was determined to do so; I rarely start a book without finishing it.  I will not bore you with plot details or particulars other than to say the them of falling in love with a vampire, a love that is doomed by (fill in the blank) is so shopworn now as to be difficult for even a talented writer.  And this is not the work of a talented writer.  Given the reviews, I had hoped for better.

B000E1155E|3.0|The Arctic Monkeys' seem to have this idea that rock 'n' roll is all about attitude, smoking, an over-imbued working class British accent and lyrics about 'dirty dancefloors' and 'dreams of naughtiness'. There isn't really much more to them, which doesn't make for the most interesting listen. Luckily their music is 'fairly good'; stomping garage rock with a strange sense of 'glam' about it (maybe it's their choice of the occasional big word that makes it seem 'glamorous').     The opening slew of songs seem to suggest all the Arctic Monkeys do is make rave up anthems about picking up a chick in a nightclub. But there is a certain enchanting poeticism to 'A Certain Romance', 'When the sun goes down' and 'Mardy Bum', almost like Dylan, even if written in a dialect usually reserved for barbaric diatribes against, for lack of a better description, 'snot-nosed snobs'. And actually I dug the guitar jams on 'Maybe vampires too strong...' and 'A Certain Romance' so much I found myself reaching for either an air-guitar or a shovel!    'Whatever people say...' is a solid rock music record that ultimately betrays it's own shallowness. And the slightest mention of names like 'Father Cockroach', 'Stink-knot' and 'Limpin Park' makes 'The Arctic Monkeys' seem like..... well... like 'Einstein' (ok, maybe not 'Einstein', but you get the equation) and wasn't that the whole point of the garage-rock revival?

B001IBIHQ4|1.0|Please don't spend a lot of time telling me I am incorrect with my review. Lordy, its amazing when you leave a negative review, the ones that crawl out of the wood work to argue with you.... LOL...  I watched only the first Disc. Almost half of it takes place at night, the fighting, hand to hand combat, discussions, etc. YOU SEE NOTHING BUT REFLECTIONS. Who came up with that bright idea of cinomotography? This was their way of bringing the viewer into the film? STEW-PID. Could not see what was going on. Could not connect with the actors. Did not know who was who. Amazed not mentioned before in reviews!....  What is it with Col Chester Puller (RIP very famous Marine), his voice is almost the exact as the Col. Robert Stout in Band of Brothers, down to the southern drawal. I was waiting for him to say: That Dog Just Don't Hunt... hahahahah. Why the copy? No out of the box thinking skills with him either.  I purchased the film because of Band of Brothers, was by same directors and I purchased because of the amazing amount of great reviews about this film on this site. Lordy.... PASS ON THIS ONE FOLKS....SAVE YOUR MONEY.   This film is a confusing circle of miss direction, makes little sense in the beginning, you get little idea of the battles, how they are formed and why. IMHO the characters are boring, I have no interest in them. Again, as I previously mentioned I watched just 1 disc of the 6.... This was more than enough for me. If gets better would be shocked. TWO THUMBS DOWN, very disappointed and THANK GOD I bought it used/new from ReSellers paying $30 not the $46 new via Amazon.com.... Whom I love their service by the way :----)

B001OQCV2E|1.0|It's long, about an hour longer than it ever should have been.  And it filled with CGI, not all of it good by the way.  John Cusak's character must have done something really bad in another life, because in the one that he plays in this film he's followed by a never ending earthquake from one side of the planet to the next, and it never lets up!  It doesn't matter if he's in a car or a plane, the earthquake stalks him...where are the police to arrest that nasty menace of a quake?!      Seriously though, if it had been an hour shorter it would have at least been tolerable.  As it was I just kept watching and praying that it would end soon, since I have an inability to not at least see the ending of a film once I've paid my money to watch it.  And the worst part is that as an actor I like John Cusak in other films that he's done.

The four quotes below are captivate how this book changed my definition of success.    \\"It's like basketball again: Once someone tall enough, then we start to care about speed and court sense and agility and ball handling and shooting touch\\" (86).    \\"Hard work is a prison sentence only if it does not have meaning.  Once it does, it becomes the kind of thing that makes you grab your wife around the waist and dance a jig\\" (150).    \\"Success is function of persistence doggedness and the willingness to work hard for twenty-two minutes to make sense of something that most people would give up on after thirty seconds\\" (246).    \\"Marita just needed a chance.  And look at the chance she was given\\" (268).
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I loved this book and could not put it down! It's a frightening concept, a mother and son being held prisoner in an 11x11 room, but I really enjoyed the way it was written from Jack's (a five year old child) perspective. What a unique premise for a book. This is the only life Jack has ever known, so for him, their circumstances are normal and his mother has done everything in her power to make his life full.     It may seem difficult at first to believe that with as sophisticated as Jack's vocabulary is and as hard his mother works with him on language development, that some of his grammar would be so poor. It definitely sounds more like a three year old in some ways and a ten year old in others, but his life has been vastly different from a typical five year old so it actually makes some sense. He's had no conversations with anyone but his mother and while she's teaching him a great deal about new vocabulary, it would seem logical that his language would be somewhat inconsistent.     I thought Emma Donoghue did an amazing job of telling the story through little Jack's eyes while providing insight into the way he thinks, being trapped in this world and not knowing any other way. It's a very compelling story and is a book not to be missed!

0439023521|4.0|The Hunger Games is an amazing young adult novel that everyone seems to be reading so I had to check it out to see what all the hype was about. It's a really good book, but is very dark. It takes place in the future when the country is divided into 12 districts and once a year, they draw the name of one boy and one girl (age 12-18) from each district. These children have to fight to the death until there is only one winner. It's a way of keeping the people under control.     As far as my feelings about this book go, I'm torn. The story is compelling and I couldn't put it down, but it was really disturbing. I typically love dystopia novels, but I don't know exactly what it is about this one that makes it difficult to even clarify for myself what I think. I'm back and forth. On one hand, I couldn't wait to find out what would happen next and I definitely couldn't stop reading. On the other hand, I kept thinking it was incredibly dark and disturbing. The premise is so awful, it was hard to read. I wasn't even sure how to rate it, to be honest!

044024238X|3.0|My book club read The Undomestic Goddess as a \\"fun read\\" after some heavy books we'd been reading as of late. This was definitely a silly book and I enjoyed it, laughing in several places.     Samantha is a workaholic lawyer who never has time for a social life. She's trying to make partner, hoping her workload will lessen once she does. When she discovers she's made a huge mistake that will cost the company's client millions of dollars, she runs away in shock. Samantha ends up at a house and is mistaken for a housekeeper. Yes, it's unlikely but it's fun if you're in the mood for a light book.     I laughed out loud in several places even though I was thinking this isn't my usual type of book. Samantha had to learn to do everything - cook, clean, iron, etc., because she'd never done any of these things in her life as a lawyer. When Samantha curtseyed on accident to her employers, they loved it and wanted her to continue. I just shook my head and laughed. I also cracked up when her employers were trying to encourage her because they thought she was pretty smart (for a housekeeper). Later, Samantha must decide whether to go back to her old life or begin anew.     One of my friends in the book club was very taken by the love scene in the raspberry patch and we laughed when she talked about how much she enjoyed that part and we've been making raspberry patch references ever since. So I guess an occasional light read for a book club is fun!

1439102813|4.0|Still Alice is a chilling tale told from the perspective of Alice, a 50 year old woman suffering from early-onset Alzheimer's. Although the writing was a bit awkward in some places, it was fascinating to read the story of Alice's deteriorating condition told through Alice's eyes and through the reactions others had to her behavior. It was a bit jarring in many places to try and figure out what Alice was thinking or what was happening because she didn't know what something was or realize that she'd already been introduced to someone she was \\"meeting for the first time\\".     This novel is terrifying, powerful, and heartbreaking. You WILL be moved and changed by this book. I couldn't put it down and was up until all hours of the night two nights in a row, reading it until I fell asleep with my kindle wide open. My only words of caution would be this: Watch your fear of early-onset Alzheimer's grow after reading this novel. In the middle of reading, I was logging onto a website and could NOT remember my password. My heart started beating like crazy and I was convinced I had early-onset Alzheimer's!
B0038M2AZA|5.0|To see Claire Danes interviewed as Claire Danes and then to see Claire Danes acting as Temple Grandin ... is to see Claire Danes interviewed as herself and then to see Temple Grandin, period. Danes became Grandin.<br /><br />Of course, Claire Danes is prettier than Grandin probably ever was, and that is sort of dismaying, much like Sandra Bullock was more fetching than the real woman portrayed in \\"Blindside\\". But the Danes portrayal is nothing short of phenomenal. As some who know have said, Danes acted really \\"true to character\\". In mannerism and spirit, at least, she WAS Temple Grandin. She even transformed herself visually to look like what MAYBE Grandin looked like as a young woman -- quite a lot unlike Claire Danes. I doubt it was so much make-up as it was the work of Danes herself. By contrast, Bullock, who won the Oscar, didn't bother at all to look un-Bullock-like ... which was nice (perhaps essential for commercial success), but far less a challenge than what Clair Danes did.<br /><br />As one reviewer said, \\"it is one of the best pieces of acting I've ever seen\\". The true story is compelling and moving and enlightening and inspiring; the Claire Danes infusion of life into that story on film is something to behold.<br /><br />Had the film been a movie film and not made for TV, it surely would have won at least one Oscar -- Best Actress. I have no doubt.
0385338910|4.0|Somehow Jonathan Tropper has accomplished something quite amazing. How to Talk to a Widower is both heartbreaking and hilarious.     Doug Parker is grief-stricken after losing his wife in a plane crash. He is angry, bitter, and resentful, making destructive choices and using his loss to justify them. There are several hilarious, but cringe-worthy situations in which Doug finds himself, especially when he attempts to re-enter the dating world. I laughed out loud in several places, which surprised me in a book that also quite accurately portrayed the male perspective on grief. Doug had very real fears for a 29 year old man having lost his older wife. If she hadn't died young, would he have continued to love her as she aged? I was a little disappointed that Doug didn't reach out in a deeper way to his stepson.     The many comparisons of Tropper to Nick Hornby are accurate. On several occasions I checked the front cover of the book to ensure I wasn't actually reading Hornby.  This book is touching, sad, and funny - definitely worth reading.
B00461MY30|4.0|This set sounds phenomenal. In particular \\"Beggars Banquet\\" blows the original pressing away. The packaging is not perfect, but I have no problem with the covers not being glossy and \\"Satanic Majesty's\\" not having the hologram. It's still better than CD packaging. The big glaring problem with this set is the glitch in \\"Get Off My Cloud\\" on \\"Big Hits\\". It's like the record skips, but it's a flaw of the master not the pressing. It's kind of a bummer if you like that song.
0316056863|4.0|Bossypants has been quite the adventure from start to finish. I loved the book and only Fey could get away with using humor to make the most boring situations interesting. But then why wouldn't she? Fey starts off with her childhood and I laughed out loud through the whole first 2 chapters a short one titled \\"Origin Story\\" and then \\"Growing Up and Liking It.\\" She makes fun of situations that tend to scare many and this is the main reason I like Fey's humor. Bossypants is part memoir and learning about Fey's beginnings before Saturday Night Live (SNL) was truly inspiring. As a child Fey grew up in a neighborhood of immigrant families in a small town in Pennsylvania. Her mother Greek her father a mix of German and Scottish descent Fey considers herself rather plain and pokes fun at this throughout her book. I didn't know much about the life of Tina before I read this book and I found Bossypants an enjoyable ride. You will travel with Fey as she takes you through her life and talks about her blunders and highlights that brought her to where she is today. Tina places an emphasis on how life can truly make you crazy if you take everything seriously. This book is Tina Fey in the raw and she exposes herself as the altogether human being she is. Something that can be hard to grasp when she is seen on television.

0786956291|4.0|The bottom line is, D&D is a lot of fun.  But it's confusing at first.  You have to do some homework, familiarizing yourself with some complicated rules.  But soon it all starts to flow and you get the idea.  Don't listen to all the other whiners about how the 4th edition rules ruined everything about the game, etc.  Rules just provide a rough framework.  The role playing/imagination element is up to the people playing the game.  This isn't chess.  You CAN just make it up as you go.  The starter set gets you going and has what you need to make several cool characters and take them through a pre made adventure with battles and challenges up to level two.<br /><br />However, the D&D product line is very frustrating and confusing for the beginner, like me.  It's full of redundant products, so I couldn't figure out what I really needed to buy beyond the Starter Set.  I've wasted a lot of money.  So here is what I wish someone had told me.<br /><br />You DON'T need to buy the \\"Core Rulebooks\\" ($66).  They can be easily substituted with other things.  For instance, if you buy the Starter Set, you'll make characters using powers and abilities that don't even come from the Player's Handbook (PHB), but come from \\"Heroes of the Fallen Lands\\", which is a \\"supplement,\\" but fills the same role as the PHB.  If you buy Heroes of the Fallen Lands instead of the PHB, you'll have info about making characters that's more compatible with your Starter Set.<br /><br />What about the Dungeon Master's Guide(DMG)?  Buy the Dungeon Master's Kit instead.  It comes with an equivalent book, plus a bunch of tokens for characters and monsters, maps and a cool pre written adventure to take characters from level 2 to level 4.  Oh, and a dungeon master's screen, too.<br /><br />And the Monster Manual?  The \\"Monster Vault\\" has an equivalent book (a few less monsters, but still plenty to work with) plus more monster tokens, maps and another adventure ready made to send 4th level adventurers up to level 5.<br /><br />To summarize, if you get the \\"Core Rulebooks\\" you'll spend $66 and have three cool books, but no stuff with which to actually play the game (maps, dice, something to represent characters, monsters, etc. and you'll have to create your adventures from scratch, which can be fun but difficult.  OR, you can spend $73 for the Starter Set, Monster Vault, DM Kit, and Heroes of the Fallen Lands and have the equivalent of the core books, PLUS all the other cool stuff to play with and get characters up to level 5 and beyond.  By then, you'll have all the experience you need to create your own adventures a lot more easily.  You won't need to buy minis, graph paper or battle mats or anything, except maybe a few more sets of dice for each player.<br /><br />You'll probably end up buying the core books sometime anyway, just because they're cool.  But do it only because you want to, not because you think you need them to start and enjoy a long career playing D&D.l 5.<br /><br />To summarize, if you get the \\"Core Rulebooks\\" you'll spend $66 and have three cool books, but no stuff with which to actually play the game (maps, dice, something to represent characters, monsters, etc. and you'll have to create your adventures from scratch, which can be fun but difficult.

B001DCQI82|5.0|As we all know, 90% of listeners prefer the 1963 cycle, relegating the likes of me firmly to the Minority. Here is my Apologia for the 1976 / 1977 cycle. Please note: this set has been remastered elsewhere and superlatively so. Skip this offering.<br /><br />1 - The 1977 Ninth is widely considered to be among the greatest recordings of all time - it is the Transit of Jupiter set to music. In the very least, it is the equal of its predecessor as a performance and the choir do not sound as if they were recorded at the bottom of the River Spee. As others have noted, Herbie red-lines himself at the end of the symphony and this is a rarity for such a highly controlled conductor. The sheer ferocity of the first movement is sui generis (with apologies to Toscanini). When comparing cycles, the better Nine must surely carry weight.<br /><br />2 - The Pastoral is a far more relaxed affair than the overly tense 1963 performance and the key repeat in the scherzo is observed. Many people are not convinced by Herbie's reading of the Pastoral per se: again, I am in the Minority and this 1976 performance, IMO, is the best actualisation of his approach. For instance, the great Brucknerian blaze-ups in the finale are 'Affirmations of Being' - and how they resonate!<br /><br />3. Again, as others have noted, the October 1976 performance of the Seventh is a once off. It might seem too 'stringy' to modern ears but what strings they are. The 1963 performance is superlative, but there is something about its successor that is ultimately inexplicable and thus all the more electrifying. The opening of the slow movement is the Oresteia set to music.<br /><br />4. Herbie excelled  in the Eroica. Indeed, even the 1984 'Karajan Gold' performance has strong - if not stronger - claims on a collector (along with the superlative 8). I concede the excellence of the 1963 alternative but again, the first movement of the 1977 Eroica is a once off. The Penguin Guide was right to highlight its peculiar nature but errant in their choice of words. Far from being edgy, it is akin to the young Napoleon heatedly scaling the Alps like Hannibal in search of his destiny. To my mind it has no peer - and the other three movements are comparable.<br /><br />5. Unlike the 'Gold' performance of the Fourth from 1984, Karajan observes the second half repeat in the Scherzo and how delightful it is. The later performance is also marred by tension (Herbie and the Berliners were not exactly bosom-buddies at the time). Here, the playing of the orchestra is ferocious in its joie de vivre.<br /><br />6. The other symphonies - 1, 2, 5, and 8 - to my ears do not differ greatly from their '63 predecessors with one exception: the Berlin Philharmonic itself. The orchestra evolved over time (and under Herbie's tutelage)to become a near-infallible ensemble by the mid-1970s when these recordings were made (infallible in terms of its core repertoire, not, say, Bach or Stravinsky). Most of its recordings from the 1970s radiate a supreme self-confidence if not a swagger, married to virtuosity of the highest order. To use a well worn, if not worm-ridden cliche, they play as if their lives depend upon it - such could be the epithet of these leonine performances.<br /><br />Make no mistake: this cycle is Beethoven writ large - a Colossus who bestrides the earth - whereas at his feet lie the puny creations of Norrington, Jeggy, Abbado ( x 3), Harnoncourt, Rattle, Zinman, all of whom are infected by Hogwood-itis to varying degrees. Longevity is not theirs; the ignoble grave beckons.<br /><br />As demonstrated by a once-off release of 5, 6 & 9, the entire 1976/77 cycle could benefit from a remastering ([[ASIN:B00008CLNP Beethoven: Symphonies Nos. 5, 6 & 9]]). And indeed, this has actually ocurred (thanks to Sean Pak for making this known to me):<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000WQGPNI Beethoven: the 9 Symphonies Overtures]]<br /><br />You no longer have to put up with the remasterings from the mid-1980s. While this2007 remaster might have been designed primarily for surround sound, it had a beneficial impact across the board. I have lived with those old remasters for well over twenty years - they're the glorified Galleria issues - and this new set is like chalk and cheese, even on standard equipment. Consider the Eroica disc with its timpani throughout the Funeral March; the brass at the apotheosis of its finale and the Overture \\"Leonore No.3\\", Op.72b per se: there's greater warmth and detail. Indeed, the sound is sumptuous - again, even on a normal CD player. This was worth the wait.<br /><br />Do not look past this cycle in its refurbished state. Rejoice in dissent.2007 remaster might have been designed primarily for surround sound, it had a beneficial impact across the board.

As they assemble their elite team of top racers, the unlikely allies know their only shot of getting out for good means confronting the corrupt businessman who wants them dead.

B004SEVPWQ|1.0|Pool Break Pro has great 3D graphics, convincing physics, and a really nice bonus online mode for playing with friends. I was going to install it on my 7&quot; tablet as well as my phone, which Amazon's App Store facilitates, but worrisome wording in the EULA this app claims you already agreed to before even reading it stipulates that it can only run on one &quot;computer.&quot;  In all likelihood the developer hasn't even read the bundled EULA and wouldn't object to multiple installations for one user's devices but for whatever reason he decided to make his software a contract instead of a product. So unless you get this app for free, I would discourage you from getting it.

B004LWZVZC|4.0|Many Americans are using the year 2011, the 150th anniversary of the beginning of the Civil War, as an opportunity to reflect on the meanings of this seminal event in our history. \\"The Conspirator\\", a new movie directed by Robert Redford, examines the end of the Civil War rather than the beginning. The movie is set with the assassination of Abraham Lincoln on April 14, 1865 the conspiracy which planned it, and the ensuing military trials of the conspirators. The conspirators aimed to kill Vice-president Johnson and Secretary of State Seward in addition to the President and narrowly missed these goals. When John Wilkes Booth was killed, four conspirators were brought to trial including a woman, Mary Suratt, who kept a boarding house where the conspirators, among them her son, met to plan their activities. Mary Suratt's trial and the young lawyer who defended her, a Union officer in the War named Aiken, are the focus of this movie.<br /><br />Mary Suratt was not an appealing defendant in any circumstances, let alone under the fear which gripped Washington after the assassination.  She was an avowed Confederate sympathizer and did little to help her pleas of innocence. She argued essentially that keeping a boarding house is no crime and that she was unaware of what her boarders may have been doing behind closed doors in their rooms.<br /><br />Young Aiken took the case at the behest of venerable United States Senator from Maryland, Reverdy Johnson.  In the movie, Aiken at first shows substantial reluctance to become involved as he believes the evidence points strongly to Mary Suratt's guilt. Most historians who have since studied the matter share Aiken's initial reaction that Mary Suratt was guilty of conspiracy as charged. But Aiken pursues the case and sees good grounds to argue Suratt's innocence of conspiracy. He defends her with force, commitment, and great personal and professional cost to himself. Aiken fulfills the lawyerly mission of advocacy and defense for those unable to speak for themselves.<br /><br />The movie moves back in forth between testimony at the military hearing, the underlying events on which the testimony is based, and Aiken's efforts on behalf of Mary Suratt. In general, the story line is easy to follow. The portrayals of Aiken, Mary Suratt, and Secretary of War Stanton are good as are the depictions of Civil War era Washington, D.C. The scene in which the four conspirators are hung is particularly effective, especially in its use of the photographer Matthew Brady. Brady took a famous grizzly picture of the four conspirators hanging from their ropes which is echoed well in the movie.<br /><br />The movie can be viewed on several levels.  The film offers a good portrayal of the trial of Booth's conspirators, an event which may be unfamiliar to many Americans. The movie's sympathy towards Mary Suratt does not deprive it of accuracy. \\"The Conspirators\\" also has a contemporary focus. Redford draws parallels between the denial of civil liberties and fair judical process in the period following the assassination on the one hand and events in the United States following September 11, 2001, on the other hand. Viewers of the film may work through and consider the parallels.<br /><br />As a retired lawyer, the part of the movie that most interested me was young Aiken and the passion he put into Mary Suratt's defense. \\"The Conspirators\\" aptly calls attention to the nobility of the law, when well practiced. The defense of unpopular causes does not know ideological boundaries. I thought of a recent event postdating the movie in which a prestigious law firm withdrew due to pressure from the defense of a Federal statute called DOMA unpopular to some people. The distinguished lawyer assigned to the case then left the law firm so that he could continue his role of vigorous defense. It was this latter action rather than the former that met the ideals of the legal profession that Aiken followed so eloquently in his defense of Mary Suratt.<br /><br />Robin Friedman
B000W1V5OC|5.0|There are some technical issues with the DVD which others have remarked on.  I would add to those that subtitles of the lyrics would have been welcome.<br /><br />This is a truly emotional concert on many levels.  It was the last time that Tarja Turunen performed as lead singer with Nightwish.  The band fired her after that concert....  She had previously asked to quit after one more album.  It is the end of the \\"opera metal\\" era for this band.  Never again would these songs be performed with the same grandeur, or as moving, as they were then, and many of them (especially Ever Dream) are completely beyond the ability of Tarja's eventual replacement (Annette Olzon).<br /><br />The concert is well organized, with large numbers of contrasts brought into it.  Some songs are extremely melodic (Sleeping Sun) and others are downright noisy (Siren, Slaying the Dreamer).  In between we are treated to performances of Native American John Two-Hawks both with (Creek Mary's Blood) and without (Stone People) the band.  Somehow the chanting and Native American flute music does not get out of place among the metal that surrounds it and sometimes blends with it.<br /><br />The music itself is completely unique.  There is nothing like it around today.  Great metal and symphonic sounds paired with a great, almost operetic voice.<br /><br />Additionally the lyrics are full of references to Classical Greece, from \\"Save a penny for the ferryman\\" as the refrain in \\"Planet Hell\\" to the theme of Siren which juxtaposes the imagery of Odysseus tied to the mast with astrological symbolism.  Tuomas's talent as a poet and a songwriter shines forth as truly as Tarja's voice.<br /><br />Highly recommended even for non-metal fans.
B004478GN8|4.0|My nephew loves the LEGO Star Wars game for Xbox. So, I bought him this LEGO set as well. He was so thrilled. When the mommy limits his Xbox playing time, he uses his imagination to continue playing with this LEGO set. Very cute!    As for the product itself, I'm not sure how else to explain it. It's a LEGO set - something we are all aware of and played with when we were all young. Of course times have changed and it's so cool how these sets have themes! Get it for the kids and they'll love it.

B000UBMWG4|5.0|Blade Runner is one of the most influential science fiction films of all time and it's also a film that has stood the test of time incredibly well. While Harrison Ford already had the first two Star Wars films and Raiders of the Lost Ark under his belt by the time Blade Runner was released, the sci-fi thriller can certainly be labeled as the film that put Rutger Hauer on the map while Roy Batty is probably Hauer's most recognized role. After Alien, Blade Runner is one of the main films that first added credibility to Ridley Scott's name. Despite its flaws, Blade Runner is still a brilliant sci-fi film that seems to get better with each viewing.<br /><br />The atmosphere in Blade Runner is revolutionary and thick right from the start. The Los Angeles of 2019 features the likes of flying cars called spinners, giant skyscrapers riddled with moving advertisements and commercials, and the Voight-Kampff machine (VK for short) to help determine if someone is a replicant among many other cutting edge things. The lighting in the film is key to making the film feel as futuristic as it does. Take any scene where Deckard is in the depths of Los Angeles. Those congested city lights are probably the main visuals you'll take away from those scenes. When Deckard first meets up with Captain Bryant, Bryant runs down the list of Nexus 6 replicants. A blue light blankets the room they're in. There's something about that blue light along with that conversation between Deckard and Bryant that makes that scene incredibly memorable.<br /><br />Blade Runner is based on the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? by Philip K. Dick. I've never read it, but I certainly intend to. I'm unsure how similar the film is to the source material though. Other than the film still feeling like a neo-noir film set in the future without feeling too dated, an extraordinary story is buried underneath. Genetically engineered organic robots take center stage, but just the idea of something like implanted memories will make the wheels in your brain spin a little faster. Everyone has heard of \\"making friends,\\" but its definition will be a little bit different after one viewing of this film as Gaff's origami will be one of the last things on your mind once the film ends. There's a lot to take in with Blade Runner. There are several layers to the film and it certainly requires multiple viewings.<br /><br />Blade Runner may come off as a frustrating experience at first and that could come down to which version of the film you watch. There are at least five different versions of the film and that could be a bit overwhelming. I'm pretty sure I originally sat through the theatrical version at first, which I thought was okay. My general consensus was that there was a fantastic film buried down in there somewhere, but it felt like I was missing something; almost as if there was an entire film before this one that everyone else had seen but me and I decided to jump in later on. That's where the frustration came in. I wanted to like this film, but it was difficult to do so when nothing really seemed to add up. After viewing The Final Cut a few times, things are a bit more clear and it seems like I'm able to catch certain things I didn't catch during the previous viewing. I'd recommend checking out The Final Cut first and then venturing onto the other versions of the film, if the interest is still there.<br /><br />While we're on the subject, is it just me or is Deckard kind of a wimp? On the surface, he's fairly similar to the other roles that made Harrison Ford famous. But once the action starts getting heavy, Deckard is usually on the receiving end of a beatdown without much offense on his part. In the entire film, he lands one punch, three gunshots, and two pipe swings. He spends a good portion of the film getting roughed up by women and then he practically rapes a replicant. He just seems like an odd choice for a hero. Rick Deckard is still an exceptional character, but justkind of a bizarre protagonist once you think about it. Roy Batty is definitely worth a mention or two, as well. Any scene with Roy is guaranteed to be good, but his highlight is of course the rooftop scene. The chase through The Bradbury is just as good though. That \\"tears in the rain\\" speech that Roy makes at the end is something that'll live on for decades. It's just so perfect and the fact that it was partially improvised by Hauer just makes it all the more spectacular.<br /><br />In the end, there probably isn't a whole lot that can be said about a film like Blade Runner that hasn't already been said. The cast is near perfect, especially Harrison Ford and Rutger Hauer, the storyline in the film is done so well that it seems to unravel a few pieces at a time every time you sit down to watch it, and the film is just able to offer a spectacular vision of the future that still looks and feels like the future thirty years after the fact. Although, this is one film you should try to catch in theaters if at all possible as it sounds incredible. Throw in the fantastic lighting to help establish the futuristic atmosphere and the film is rounded out so well that not much else can compare to it. Blade Runner is a film that makes you think and makes you admire things you normally wouldn't in a film. It's a sci-fi masterpiece that was definitely ahead of its time. Films like this don't come along very often. They should be cherished to your best ability while you're able to do so before they're lost in time...like tears in the rain.nce you think about it.

0099428385|4.0|I'm glad Allison Pearson wrote a book about the double life of a working mother.  Ever since women proved they can do the jobs of men, they've been doing that and the jobs of mothers, and it's just too much.  I could feel the tension in the book and sympathized with the main character as she tried to live up to everyone's expectations.  Unfortunately, there are many women around the world who are struggling with this dilemna every day, but no one acknowledges the great difficulty and balance.  Least of all, feminists have dropped the ball.  There's no one to support us, the working or the stay-at-home moms, and we continually try to find ways to defend our positions.<br /><br />I'm so glad this is going to be made into a movie.  It's great to be able to say, \\"See.  See how hard it is!\\"  This book is a comfort to anyone who has tried to raise children and continue to work.  It affirms what we feel.

B004NSULHM|4.0|With their eight studio recording, The King of Limbs, Radiohead have (un)willingly sparked the biggest controversy among their hardcore fan base since Kid A. Clocking in under forty minutes it is not only the shortest but also the most puzzling of the quintet's albums. A rational dissection of it would lead nowhere, so I will attempt a very personal view a few months past its release.    I do not agree with those saying KOL is a regrettable craft to cash on their (ever going) relevance. It is contradictory in itself to ask repetition and formulas from a band like Radiohead. Anyone waiting for a relapse on The Bends or OK Computer will be greatly disappointed.    Following the progression of their last few records it makes sense the direction in which they are heading. Rather than judge it by parameters of mainstream conventionalities, one should look at it as the result of a desire to veer to the tangent instead of satisfying expectations, of creating a niche instead of fulfilling an existing one. Radiohead make it clear do not care about the audience's taste, let alone critics reactions, and they pursue their own path.     KOL is more a mood record than an ideas one. It is more sensorial than logical. From lead single Lotus Flower, whose video shows him in a frenetic dance, to the ghostly Codex, deserving successor to Pyramid Song, Thom Yorke gets away doing what he has barely hinted at before: mixing emotions into tracks as intricate and grey as his own persona. Not to say grey here is no good. Feral is just what the title suggests and is the standout piece in KOL. By the time Separator ends with \\"wake me up, wake me up\\" one cannot but chuckle at the irony.    While Phil Selway's percussion averts syncopation, Yorke's lyrics swim in vagueness, and Ed Greenwood's guitars sound repressed, there is a deliberate sequence in the scattered composition that comprises the songs into a block. At times this appears to be a malign lump, but a detailed listen bring out the individuality of the songs.     From my perspective Radiohead, and especially Thom Yorke, have become a modern incarnation of Glenn Gould: admirable music intelligence, secretive private life, an entity that assimilates the current technology and turns it into an untold story, an inexhaustible urn of renovation. I no longer attempt to understand them as much as I enjoy immersing in their art, slowly savoring every ply in each experience.   This is no blind libation. They deserve to be contemplated through different eyes, seeking richness and not affirmation. In escaping labels, in undermining established canons, Kings of Limbs is a success.

B004LUHQ1G|5.0|The last spawn of the grunge era turned alternative rock idols, soon forsaken to the oblivion most veteran bands eventually face. Foo Fighters have shed all adornment in what is simply their second best record to date. Their \\"back to basics\\" approach has paid with fans and critics alike, and for every good reason.    Foo Fighters always had a lot to prove. Despite David Grohl's intent to break ties from the shadow of Nirvana, lyrics and song structure for the (newly) quintet were never rocket science, oriented more for the masses than for the exploring connoisseur. That's why after the departure The Colour and the Shape meant, the stagnancy of four subsequent records made the disappointment even more deafening. The same trite of loud/quiet combination and chord progression twisted to all the possible forms called for a rapid change.    The recording of Wasting Light was an old pals reunion, with Butch Vig orchestrating the camp, Krist Novoselic lending bass and accordion, and longtime collaborator Pat Smear is welcomed back as a core member.     If there is a constant with the Foos is the fist-pumping anthems and melodic tunes. Thus, These days becomes the new stadium singalong pick, while Back & forth brings back a more radio-friendly sound. The three-guitar attack blasts through opening Bridge Burning and the abrasive White limo. On I should have known the collaboration with Novoselic results in a galloping composition that tests Grohl's vocal cords.     Closing track Walk is the shining gem of the record, and will provide the perfect ending in live shows if they choose smartly. It comprises the spirit of a band that has moved past their pastiche beginnings and accepted maturity as part of their game. \\"I'm learning to walk again / I believe I've waited long enough\\" is an admittance of what's past but it is the \\"Never wanna die/Never wanna leave/Never say goodbye\\" yell that summons what it is all about.     I will paraphrase a friend's words: \\"I wish the last ten years in the Foo's history had been a nightmare that never happened.\\" Wasting Light feels like a rebirth that has pumped life into an aging audience and expanded it beyond the meddling reminiscers. The songwriting is, at last, solid and congruent with the place the band's in and the music hails it, loudly.
B00466HM28|4.0|Great product for the price - great for messing around at home, I wouldn't use for performances. Feels a little cheap, but overall was EXACTLY what I was looking for.  Worked in Ableton Live 8 with no problems. Can use to play in notes, drum beats or trigger clips, effects and other in Live functions.  My bottom left pad sticks sometimes, but not often enough to fuss about in my opinion.

044654759X|1.0|I usually love Nicholas Sparks novels, but lately, especially with this one, I have been disappointed.   If you have seen the movie \\"Sleeping with the Enemy\\" with Julia Roberts, this book is a carbon copy. Same story, but a few different details. As I was reading this, I felt ripped off because it was such a copy. I figured I should stick it out until the end thinking maybe it would actually be different, but it of course, wasn't.     The description of the villain was WAY WAY overdone. It felt like the same description was written over 10 different ways and just pasted in between the other chapters. The editing on this book is dreadfully poorly done. This whole book felt like it was just pieced together sloppily to sell another book. You can tell that it was rushed, copied from the movie Sleeping with the Enemy, and rushed out to the public for a $.     I thought the Notebook, The Rescue, Bend in the ROad, and Nights in ROdanthe were good books,(boring movie but good book) Last Song was too simplified. True Believer had  me yawning all the way through.     I am not going to rush out and buy any more of Nicholas Sparks novels. This one was a joke folks.
0756405890|5.0|My husband kept pushing this book on me, but because of the size I didn't want to commit. While I am an avid reader I very rarely just pick up a new author and go to town because of my work schedule.    Well in this case, I'm glad my husband prevailed. I devoured this book in three days, and now I'm a third of the way through the second one. This is an EXCELLENT fantasy novel, and a must have for any fan of LOTR or really any sort of fantasy buff.    It's written with a detail similar to The Historian or Kushiel's Dart, you begin to think the world he's describing is real because of the way he tells it.    Excellent, buy it. Buy it buy it buy it. You will NOT regret it.
0307887960|4.0|I had tried the calorie counting and balanced Carb/Protein/Fats approach and just wasn't making progress. My carb cravings foiled me constantly and it was stressful to always be thinking about how I was going to achieve my calorie deficit for the day. I saw my sister who had been on the diet and for the first time since she had a baby, she was down to her pre-baby weight (5'9\\" and 135 lbs). So, on April 9, I started the diet at 5'6\\" and 136 lbs. I'm currently around 124-126 lbs and I'm going to keep to PP and PV days for about 1 more week with the hope of finishing up at about 123 lbs. After that, I will switch back to a maintenance calorie counting approach (about 1700 total calories per diem for my currently semi-to-low active lifestyle (gym 3-4 days a week for about 1 hour, desk job)).     Just make sure you drink lots of water to be extra careful about not stressing your kidneys.    Good luck!
B002ZG99TK|4.0|Tony Scott teams up with his muse Denzel Washington to direct this action thriller. As the name suggests this is about a train run amok laden with toxic chemicals and heading straight for a populated town. This is a movie where one can easily speculate the end but the film succeeds because it was partially based on real life experiences, the editing, action sequences and the direction stand out. The lead actors do not have much to do but play out the age old rookie and veteran roles. I could not take my eyes away from the screen; the last time this happened to me was when I watched `Speed' many years ago. Four stars. 4/22/2011

B0033QEQGW|4.0|Amadeus Quartet was very highly regarded in its heyday, and was generally considered to be one of the world's leading quartets. These recordings were made in the 1960's and 1970's, and the sound is consistently very good. The group plays with great vigour and energy, but also with finesse and attention to detail, as is fitting to a group of their caliber. To me these recordings sound very Mozartean; this is classic Mozart playing at its best.<br /><br />In fact, I prefer this kind of \\"old-fashioned\\" sound far better than modern \\"improvements\\" such as SACD, DSD, DXD, or whatever, as they often sound much better in normal two-channel stereo. Maybe this has something to do with the fact that my stereo system is rather old (from the mid and late 80's, that is), and I have often found it to be the case that a well-engineered older recording just sounds better to my ears than any of the more recent state-of-the art innovations. Old goes well with the old, maybe... This may be just a matter of taste, however. (Boy, did they make good stereo systems way back then - not a trace of planned obsolescence...)<br /><br />The booklet has detailed information about the recording times and venues, although it does not say if the original recordings were remastered. But that does not really matter, because, as I said, the sound is just fine. There is also an informative essay on the quartets by Tully Potter.<br /><br />The only real drawback seems to be that the Amadeus Quartet apparently does not play all of the repeats, so some movements are shorter than with ensembles who meticulously observe the repeats. I don't mind that very much; if fact, this approach seems to make the quartets themselves more concise: more playing, less wallowing.<br /><br />As a bonus, this set also includes excellent and spirited performances of three of Mozart's best-known divertimentos, K. 136-138.<br /><br />So if you are a seasoned collector or just want a good overview of the Mozart quartets, this set is a worthy addition to your library. Even if you would later decide to buy more interpretations of these works, this set is a great point of comparison from a purely historical point of view, and as a document how Mozart was interpreted by one of the great quartets of the last century.Even if you would later decide to buy more interpretations of these works, this set is a great point of comparison from a purely historical point of view, and as a document how Mozart was interpreted by one of the great quartets of the last century.

I've just finished reading (in about 5 days) the entire series, and this is with a full time job, attention hogging partner, and pushy, demanding cat (yes, she's half on the keyboard now, any typos are hers :) )  I just had to keep reading.  The story is incredible, futuristic, but not at all unbelievable, and perhaps that's what makes it so riveting.  Scene descriptions make places you can only imagine come to life.  I didn't want it to end, however the ending is perfectly suited to the tone of the series.  I've not enjoyed, nor had many books in the hundreds and hundreds of books I've read in my lifetime make an impression like these three did.  This is not just for young adults, anyone who truly enjoys gripping fiction will like this.  I can't wait to pass this around to my friends so I'll have someone to discuss this with.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|I'm an old time Star Trek fan but the original cast definitely had some weak movies. This movie not only resets the story line but the actors are top rate in their roles. I know the time travel line can be overused but in this case it doesn't detract and adds a freshness to the series. Zachary Quinto is excellent in his portrayal of Spock balancing his Vulcan and Human sides. A big thumbs up!
0316069353|5.0|Of course it's court drama; it's the Lincoln Lawyer at work.  However, The Fifth Witness is different from the other Haller novels, which are often more traditional crime stories.  This is actual courtroom stuff, recalling the earlier work of, e.g., Steve Martini.  The novel proceeds day by day, witness by witness and focuses on the workings of a defense attorney's mind.  The law and legal strategy are the focal points of the novel.  Past surveys have shown that there is a disconnect between readers' interests and publishers' offerings.  Bottom line: readers love courtroom drama, but there's too little of it out there.  There's too little because you need to be able to think like a defense attorney and you need to know the law and the lore to write such a book.  Steve Martini's earlier books were fascinating in their exploration of courtroom procedure, even if the writing was not as polished as in the author's later work.  Connelly, however, brings his silk-smooth prose along with the courtroom strategy and lore.  The result is something very special (but slightly different from the preceding novels).<br /><br />Connelly began his career as a journalist, but he has been able to immerse himself in the world of the law and The Fifth Witness is the most dramatic result to date.  The subject is also current.  A woman who was about to lose her house because of her own defaults and the machinations of a sleazy foreclosure company is accused of murdering a bank official.  Although she claims to have never actually met him, his blood is on one of her shoes and one of her tools.  Mickey thinks she's been framed because, he argues, she is simply too short in height to deliver the blows to the top of the victim's skull which resulted in his death.  The prosecutor thinks otherwise and Mickey's ex, Maggie, a prosecutor herself, sympathizes with both.  But what will the jury say and will the trial truly bring justice?<br /><br />A thoughtful page-turner; don't miss it.  (And don't be put off by the overall evaluation numbers.

0316056863|5.0|Ha ha...I plagerized that line from my reviews title from 30 Rock, sorry Tina.<br /><br />This book is great, I laughed out loud many many times, not surprising knowing Tina Feys comedy writing but it is also very smart (also not a shocker).<br /><br />So many humorous stories from Feys life you havent heard before.<br /><br />Also intelligent views on life and feminism.<br /><br />Really makes you think about the way things/life are , in a good way<br /><br />Highly recommend!

1423101502|5.0|have spent hundreds on books to try to get my kid interested in reading; not to mention hours in libraries and talking to librarians about how to get my kid interested in reading. But this series did the trick. Thank you Percy Jackson. Thank you Rick Riordan.
0756405890|4.0|I did like the story as it was quite well written.   My only problem was in the reading because it was a bit difficult prose with many strange words or dialects to slow you down.   I loved the end and can see why people have waited \\"forever\\" for the second book to come out.   The set-up was great.  However, such a very long - and likely difficult read - will just have to wait for me anyway.
B004Q1FDHO|5.0|I think a few of these reviewers might need to learn how to operate an Android based device. Some programs actually run better if you turn off compatibility mode, give the phone a reboot, etc. Anyway, the game is goofy an fun with a variety of elements (little bit of dynamite fishing, a little bit of duck hunter, power-ups) and even a cute little redneck story line. It also supports apps2sd which is a plus! Well worth the money if you want a fun and funny time waster game!

0345529057|5.0|This is the best fantasy series out there and its a must read, especially for those who are now hooked on the HBO show Game of Thrones.    But Amazon, can you please remove the user reviews? Im sick and tired of Kindle users giving low stars due to price. This really needs to be sorted out - perhaps a seperate ratings system for price or for kindle versions etc.
B001GM28HO|4.0|Lady Gaga is discussed everywhere from the news to sitcoms to school and the office. A lot of the discussion - as with many female artists - is about her appearance or how crazy she seems most of the time. She gets a lot of attention for the persona she has created for the stage. What a lot of people don't take the time to judge on is her music, which deserves all that conversation on its own.     Lady Gaga is not breaking down any walls in the music world. She is not doing anything with pop music that hasn't been done before. She has created an album of effective pop and dance numbers on her first album that are enjoyable and guaranteed to get some radio airplay. Just because she's not exactly the trailblazer that she sometimes makes herself out to be doesn't mean she hasn't accomplished something with this solid debut.     Before I go any further, I think I should make something clear. I love Lady Gaga. I think she's an interesting artist and performer. I think her message to the world about being comfortable with yourself is an important one. But I'll be the first to admit this is nothing new. I don't mean to offend anyone with my comments about her not being some revolutionary. With that said, let's get back to the music.     The Fame is something uncommon these days: an album that actually has a clear theme (fame, love, and feeling like a star regardless of whether or not the rest of the world sees it), and sticks to it. The songs fit nicely together and are a genuine album instead of a random collection of songs.     Another thing that makes Lady Gaga a sudden success and a little different from a lot of the other songs you may be hearing on the radio lately is her smart lyrics and the topics she chooses to delve into. She stresses the importance of pop culture in our society. She discusses the need everyone has to feel important and loved. She tells breakup stories in which she is not just the sad woman who was done wrong. She goes into her bisexuality in a serious way and not just the \\"look how hot I am kissing a girl\\" way that has become so common. She celebrates her sexual feelings and her love of men and women in a positive way.     The Fame is overall a huge success as a debut. It is not perfect, but it is well put together and easy to listen to. In the end, people want their pop music mostly upbeat and with enough humor and passion to make even the toughest moments on it bearable. The Fame does all that and more.

0385340575|4.0|Gone Tomorrow, the third Jack Reacher novel I've read and it was a great read. I followed Jack Reacher throughout Manhattan and watched him get into and out of trouble up one street and down another. This author's mind is very creative and I have enjoyed this book tremendously. I look forward to reading all the other Reacher novels which I am sure will be just as exciting.

0060899220|1.0|If I was interested in becoming a chef would I have liked this book more?<br /><br />If I liked Anthony Bourdain would I have liked this book more?<br /><br />Hard to say, but I think the answer to the first question might be \\"Maybe, but doubtful\\" and the answer to the second question is, \\"Probably not\\".<br /><br />I thought the beginning of Kitchen Confidential was interesting but I don't need anyone advising me not to eat in restaurants with dirty bathrooms or to treat servers with respect. It was this blow-the-lid-off-the-restaurant-industry type of hype that brought me to Kitchen Confidential, but after the first couple of chapters of this type of not-so-eye-opening \\"insider\\" information, it was all downhill.<br /><br />To be honest - and this biased my view of the book - I'm not a fan of the \\"Shock\\" celebrity in today's media. Shock jocks, shock politicians, shock pundits and now, at least with this book, shock chefs. If you have something to say, please say it, I'm interested. But if what you have to say relies on insulting various groups of people and using offensive language to make a point or color a story, or if your abrasive dialogue is too often used to hammer home the idea that you're better/smarter/cooler than the people you're talking to, you can save it for someone else. The reality might be that you *are* better/smarter/cooler than the people you're talking to, but let us come to that conclusion ourselves.<br /><br />In the end, after wading through insults to vegetarians and people who like to order items on the side and pretty much anyone Mr. Bourdain has worked with (or for) in his restaurant career, as well as droning stories of drugs and sex, I found little of any substance in Kitchen Confidential. Beyond that, I found Kitchen Confidential to be little more than a boring and vulgar rant by a chef/author who maybe spends a little too much time in front of the mirror thinking all sorts of wonderful things about himself and whose stories and writing remind me of the reminiscences of 28-year-old at his ten-year high school reunion. Like the food I send back, this one is tasteless and undercooked.f 28-year-old at his ten-year high school reunion. Like the food I send back, this one is tasteless and undercooked.

It's perfect!!!    Conheci esse livro através de uma amiga minha (o meu ainda não chegou), mas tudo o q posso dizer é q esse livro é realmente ótimo!

0316056863|1.0|Tina Fey is funny. No doubt about it. I appreciate her humor and the success she has gained in a male-dominated field. She is hilarious as Sarah Palin and she has amazing wit. But this book is clunky at best and tedious at worst. There is very little literary value to Bossypants. It is written as if Tina took her monologues and transcribed them into book-form. The story itself (girl with humble beginnings makes her way in the world and makes it big) is hidden and almost lost by the inclusion of seemingly random side-stories/anecdotes/general wierdness. If you are a huge TV buff and fan of SNL and 30 Rock, you will probably like this book. If you are looking for a well-written, timeless memoir you will be disappointed.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I won't go into details about the books. There are enough reviews for that. I read all 3 books back to back and loved them. I didn't get \\"tired\\" of the story line. As an almost 40 year old woman who reads constantly, I am so impressed. Good story line with great characters. I will be looking for more from this author. The great thing about a kindle is that you are exposed to different categories of books. I would never walk into the young adult section of a book store but Amazon makes it so easy to shop different genres.
B001KWZ796|3.0|Good movie however I was hoping to transfer it to my Mp3 player but was unable to.  Bummer.  Now the movie sits on my computer taking up precisious space.  Just becase Amazons states you can transfer the movie onto a portable devise does not necessarily mean you can transfer it to yours.  I was unble to transfer it to my newly acquired Ipod touch.

B000002LPD|5.0|I have always wondered why people chose the David Lee Roth era over the Sammy Hagar era. I've always thought the Hagar era a more mature one for the group. Beyond that, the fact it brought multiplatinum status for the band says something (I'm still trying to see what was up with the Gary Cherone incarnation).<br /><br />Color me biased, but although I like songs like \\"Running With The Devil\\" and \\"Hot For Teacher\\" all Roth era Van Halen seemed so Juvenile.<br /><br />\\"5150\\" [[ASIN:B000002L99 Van Halen: 5150]] was my true introduction to Van Halen, \\"OU812\\" [[ASIN:B000002LEM Ou812]] was my chaser and \\"For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge\\" sealed the deal.<br /><br />Although this album bore a suggestive acronym, listening to it was anything but juvenile like the songs associated with the Roth led incarnation. The only song of a suggestive nature was \\"Spanked\\".This Album was full of the social commentary I loved in \\"5150\\" and \\"OU812 and that's why I stayed through \\"Balance\\" (The Dream Is Over is a very inspirational song).<br /><br />Musically, this album was not big on the synthesizers as the two previous albums, so there was more of Eddie on guitar, in both rythm and lead. Mike Anthony's Bass playing was good and Alex's drumming was great. \\"In N Out\\" still blows me away among other songs.<br /><br />All and all, like \\"OU812\\" and \\"5150\\", Sammy was a powerful presence on this album and earned my respect as Van Halen's frontman. I can't wait to read his book.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|This is a must have app for anyone. I used to have several radio music apps installed, and I swore by Slacker, but not any more. It's not radio on demand in that you can't choose the particular song or artist, but with thousands of stations to choose from it doesn't matter.
B000ZELISO|4.0|I am a real Harry Potter fan and so of course I enjoyed this film a great deal. My only problem with it how two scenes from the book were omitted and two others were added in their place. The books didn't need improving or editing. That being said it is still an excellent movie and a must have for any die-hard Potter fan like myself.
B004Q1FDHO|4.0|The game is fun, looks good, free (today) and casual. works great on my X. Someone said it didn't run on his X butbit could have been an issue of not clearing memory (battery pull/task kill) or perhaps the game was waiting for a user input.   I played for 30 min. and it was good.   Thanks for the free app!
B000JQUMPI|5.0|I've read this book several times and it just gets better and better. It's so much better than any movie ever made...although the Wynonna Rider version is my fav.

0670022411|4.0|The title can be deceiving.  \\"A Discovery of Witches\\"?  Is this a how-to book of spells?  A non-fiction account about modern-day covens?  The latest installment of the \\"Charmed' series?  Answer: \\"D\\" - None of the Above.  Or...is it \\"E\\"- a little of all the above?  This novel is a supernatural thriller/romance, but with more sophistication (and characters) than that other well-known tragic vampire love story.  Comparisons to the Twilight books are to be expected, but they are few and far between.  Sure, both novels have tortured romance between a vampire and a non-vampire, with disapproving people in their lives, along with big baddies hoping to end this verboten relationship through any means necessary.  However, the vampire's love interest in this novel, is, as you may have guessed, is a witch.  No, not a mean woman with power issues, but a Wiccan, magic-infused witch like in the movies.  Diana refuses to acknowledge her ancestry, striving to make her way in the world without the use of magic (Hello, Samantha Stevens of \\"Bewitched\\").  She comes across an ancient manuscript to continue her world-renowned research of alchemy, only to find out that this special tome has been the object of desire and intrigue of non-human creatures for centuries.  A charming, hard-to-resist (aren't they all?) vampire named Matthew enters her life, initially to find out how she's able to access the magically-hidden book.  However, as the two get to know one another, their acquaintance grows into something much deeper, and a forbidden, unnatural bond grows between them.  Other creatures (vampires, witches, and demons) also want their hands on the elusive book, but Diana is the only being able to call it up from the library (sounds strange, I know).  The conflicts between the supernatural non-humans build, and action, adventure, and intrigue ensue.  Despite the unavoidable comparisons to other books and a level of predictability, I found myself eager to find out what would happen to Dianaand Matthew.  I was especially intrigued by the world author Diana Harkness created, where witches, vampires, and demons are the three non-human \\"creatures\\" who inhabit the world along with mundane people.  The three species have a natural dislike of each other, which made many of the character interactions interesting.  Also, the subject of alchemy, Diana's field of expertise, is presented as an intriguing blend of history, chemistry, and art, with ancient representations of alchemical reactions symbolized by lavish drawings and other illustrations.  Also, the brutal death of Diana's parents when she was a young girl leaves mysteries whose answers are tied in with that coveted magical manuscript.  The unique relationship that Diana has with her aunt, her partner, and the house they live in (somewhat sentient) was interesting and amusing.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading this novel, and I fully expect there to be a sequel (or two for a trilogy), since the ending left too many unsolved questions.  If you want to read an entertaining mash-up of Twilight and Charmed, with a little Dan Brown thrown in and wrapped up in a Harlequin romance, by all means, check out this oddly-titled novel
B002G1YPH0|5.0|This cooler is great.  Very quiet and keeps the CPU under 40 degrees Celcius with only one fan.  I may put on a second fan in the future.
B000JMKNJ2|4.0|It takes special talent to create an entire world and Scott Lynch has that talent. His world seems loosely based on medieval Venice but it has its own rules, its own history, social structures and its own magic. Lynch writes a little in the style of Guy Gavriel Kay -- except that his world is more violent and occasionally the violence takes on a gratuitous almost sadistic tinge. It is because of that gratuitous violence that I am giving this book only four stars. Otherwise I found it an absorbing and enjoyable read.<br /><br />The hero, Locke Lamora, is a scruffy orphan with a talent for crime and for trouble. He and his small gang of fellow miscreants specialize in elaborate con jobs and for the first couple of hundred pages we follow one of these scenarios put together with the same care as the plot of \\"The Sting.\\" But Lamora's meddling soon entangles him in much more weighty affairs of state and ultimately the fate of his entire city.<br /><br />We meet many colorful characters -- fake priests, crime kings, aristocrats, fearsome female gladiators, beggars and thieves. Lynch's dialogue is especially masterful and colorful -- he has a way with expletives that is highly original and enjoyable.<br /><br />The one missing aspect is the absence of realistic and compelling female characters. One -- apparently Lamora's lost love, is hinted at but never seen. Perhaps the author is saving her for the sequel.<br /><br />So one and three quarters thumbs up for this book.
B0031RS4UM|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this second Reacher novel. It's a bit dated now (communication by fax?) and it strains credibility at times (cutting phone lines takes a few hours, a bridge is blown cutting off the area in Montana from the outside world etc) but psychologically it is spot-on. Reacher has many of the features of Harry Callahan and the hero of the Die Hard Movies. Characters are credible, and their motivations are believable. Looking forward to more.
B000AARKOO|4.0|Given the continuing turmoil in the Middle East, this recent film adds a little poignancy and balance even to the age-old question; of how Christians, Muslims and Jews can simply live together. At one brief moment they did, certainly in the location of the central character (Orlando Bloom). Jerusalem is the focus of power struggles between the Knights Templar and the followers of Saladin. The knights are given no flattering image. Saladin is portrayed as a reasonable man. It is an epic film with convincing action sequences. Jeremy Irons conveys a weary and gnarled strength as the Marshall of Jerusalem. Eva Green is good as the Arabic princess in an arranged marriage to the head of the knights; eventually becoming the king of Jerusalem through his wife's brother's death. Love plays a part as well! I shall certainly watch it again.<br /><br />Ian Hunter.<br />Author of [[ASIN:1618976222 The Early Years]] [[ASIN:1609118030 E-Love]]  [[ASIN:1609767675 E-Dreams]] [[ASIN:1612044824 E-World]]  [[ASIN:1618973045 Three Interludes]] [[ASIN:1622120671 Love's Anatomy]] [[ASIN:1625167210 Conversations]] [[ASIN:1946539716 Pets: An Adults' Tale]]
0440419514|5.0|I have read all three books just for leisure and didn't really try to analyze it to capability that it probably should have been done.     I have my own mixed feelings about these books, but I will not share them because I believe literature is a form of art/expression and should be interpreted by the audience how they'd like because everyone has their own life experiences and beliefs, which is what makes ONE book get scores from 1 to 5(stars).    I've read some reviews on this book, mostly the ones that gave it a 1 star, and why they felt that way.    I've come to the conclusion that this book SHOULD indeed be read by everyone of the family. Well, not everyone... it markets itself as a children's book but I would hold of giving it to my children to read until they are pre-teens or teenagers. But this why I think everyone should read this book, especially families....    This book opens up such a discussion that it's refreshing to see. So much thought and feelings comes from reading this(these) book(s). Parents are always at a lost as to how communicate with their children, but I feel this book could really open up lines of communication because call it what you want... this book is sure to get people thinking. Not only thinking but feeling... just look at all the passionate reviews from just this trilogy. And it's a timeless discussion... religion. Pullman writes it in such a way that doesn't seem too religious(if that makes sense). He mixes it in with fantasy and adventure, so children will not easily deter from reading his book.      Like it or hate it... I think families will benefit from reading this book.

B00064WSN2|4.0|In essence; this structure is a logical progression started with \\"An Observation...\\". The album is well conceived, well executed, and completes what the first album began.     Moving forward from here, the sound, instrumentation, arrangements, and compositions, would change dramatically with each new incarnation of the band.    A fine example of early King Crimson.
B0047Y0FGY|1.0|I am a fan of 30 Rock and some of SNL, however . . . .    \\"Bossypants\\" has very few laughs, is focused mostly on junior high school issues, such as looks and self-esteem, and includes lengthy behind the scene stories about SNL and 30 Rock - which feel like long winded speeches given by dear friends of a bride or groom at a wedding.     I was not expecting too much, just a light humorous read on a plane, but I found myself flipping ahead through pages and pages of filler and dullness. Essay writing is a very different skill than writing, or producing, or acting in short skit humor. Short skit humor is where Ms. Fey's talents shine so very bright.
B00004Z46W|5.0|Truly progressive in many ways, this offering challenges the listener to consider directions unique in timbre, compositional elements, improvisation, interplay, and arrangement.    Rock music was never the same after this...
B001VNB54A|5.0|I am a colossal history nerd, so I take historically-based dramas quite seriously. Band of Brothers is the only other comparison one can apply, and the Pacific is equally well done and just as powerful. My grandfather was a European theater WW2 veteran, and it wasn't till he was in his 90s that he really started opening up about the events he was a part of. I cherish those conversations and the BoB and Pacific series seem to re-enact the kinds of stories and events he described.     For all lovers of Saving Private Ryan, Band of Brothers, or a loved one who served, I highly recommend this series.
B000003S09|5.0|Simply put...required listening for anyone interested in understanding the beginnings of progressive rock.     Well constructed, composed, arranged, performed, and presented (the artwork, and graphics are just as impactful); this album brought about a new way of musical \\"thinking\\" to the rock masses.    Still powerful these many years later...
B004R10L4S|5.0|This should have gotten a lot better press and word of mouth than it did.  It was gripping, taut, mesmerizing.  I didn't take eyes off the screen once.  I saw it at a friends house and would gladly pay to see it again.

1569242739|5.0|Vegan or not, this book is fabulous.  The variety of recipes is wonderful and all of them that I have tried (which is to say, nearly all of them) work without any problems sometimes found in vegan baking.  The frosting recipes are equally wonderful.  Additionally, the layout of the book is easy to read and easy to follow.  I am not vegan, just have food allergies, but cannot tell a difference between Isa's vegan recipes and non-vegan recipes.  I've recommended this book to numerous people since it came out and they've all become followers of Isa's baking recipes.

B002ZG976U|1.0|This stated the BURLESQUE DVD was NEW.  It was a boot-legged copy and skipped entire CHAPTERS.  I could NOT even see the end of the movie.  Very disappointing, now I will have to go to BEST BUY and purchase a REAL new copy.
B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|I didn't want to watch this show. I didn't like the original despite being a big fan of older cop shows. But my husband wanted to check it out so I did. It just blew me away.    People really, really need to give this show a chance. The pilot ep was great but then the second ep not so much third ep good and the forth ep a bit weak. I think that a few people drifted away but after episode five it just got better and better and better.    Firstly, Alex O'Loughlin is brilliant as McGarrett. He starts the show as this stoic, buttoned up Seal but slowly reveals more of the characters inner workings and we see that at times he can be a softy, he can also lose his temper on occasion and has a great sense of humor.     Danno is like a wasp in a bottle. Always riled and annoyed but funny with it. I love Danno cause he calls McGarrett on all his crazy moves.     DDK and Grace Parks are both great too, DDK brings a seriousness and understatedness to the show and Grace Parks is cute and funny as Kono the rookie who is eagerly following in McGarretts footsteps.    The arguments and banter are funny and make the show and I've read that a lot of it is unscripted and improved between Caan and O'Loughlin.     The action is movie caliber and the HD shoots of Hawaii just stunning.    This show beats the CSI's/Criminal Minds and most other procedurals out there. If you like NCIS you'll love this - although it is different in many ways it has some of the same elements.    Finally the cast have amazing chemistry and they all look great (especially the supremely gorgeous Alex).     All in all only a miserable stick in the mud could not enjoy this show. No it isn't realistic or gritty or serious - its just a big old bag of actiony fun and sometimes that is just what the doctor ordered. Give it a chance and give the characters time to grow on you - you won't regret it!
B004Q1FDHO|5.0|I thought, given the title and screenshots, that this would be a stupid game. But since it was free today decided to give it a try. I was very pleasantly surprised by the gameplay, design, music, and the storyline. That there even was a storyline was a surprise in itself. If I had purchased this title by mistake, given that initial impression I'd never choose to buy it on purpose, I'd be very happy with the money I'd spent. Ifa friend insisted I try it I'm sure I'd turn around and buy myself a copy. Well worth actually paying for IMHO.
B004LGPBZ8|4.0|I was not familiar with this band, although I know they have roots in other well known bands (Oasis) of the past. Those acts were simply not bands I cared for too much. But when I heard a couple of tracks off this album, it was as if the ghost of John Lennon was haunting the studio. It sounds alot to me as though considerable effort was made to have the vocals sound like John. The musical style is mostly reminiscent of John's work that was more rock, like a few of his solo efforts, as well as the more straight ahead rock with the Beatles.   But this isn't a review of John. And perhaps some hard core Beatles fans will find the homage to the Beatles a rip-off. Not me. For me, several of the songs are so close to what I liked about John's material as to endure it to me even more. On their own merit, several of the songs here are very strong. And the boys really tip their hand when in one song, they sing about how lomng they intend to be famous - like the Beatles and Stones. Now to some this may be arrogant. Maybe. But the romantic in me is like the band saying here's what we were trying to do in case you dind't catch it. We want to sound like the best material from those bands. Sort of like singing 'the walrus was Paul.' If that's not obvious, then what is.   In the end, I really enjoy this effort. And considering that John always felt the Beatles were really just another band and wished people wouldn't worship them so much, I think he's smiling too.
0452287022|3.0|Tracy Chevalier's novel is a fictitious background story for Johannes Vermeer's famous painting.  The tale is plausible enough, told from the perspective of the girl in the painting.  Griet is a teenager in 1664 who becomes a maid in the service of Vermeer's family, but the artist recognizes when he meets her that she is a good observer of color.  She has placed her chopped vegetables in the shape of pie wedges, so that adjacent colors in the wheel are not similar.  The prose is unpretentious and straightforward, evocative of the well-mannered Griet, making this book a quick read.  I thought it rather predictable, especially with regard to the hurtful mischief that Vermeer's daughter Cornelia stirs up and the eventual role that Griet earns as Vermeer's assistant.   Of course, we know from the outset that he will paint her, and it was handy to have a photo of the painting on the cover as a reference.

It is about a group of newly captured slaves that rebelled on the slave ship titled La Amistad. The slaves are eventually captured and brought to trial for their rebellion.  A true story of individuals standing up for one another in time of need. It is also a historical journey into the past. Important history in a well made film.

0307455874|5.0|I consider myself moderate in my political views. Not a huge fan of Obama, but not one of these people who finds fault with everything he does.    As 2012 is coming up quickly, I picked up a copy of this book to get a little more insight as to who he is. I find the book to be extremely inspiring. It's one thing to read a book done AFTER you've been President, but this one, done before his election, to me, is even more interesting. It gives a lot of insight as to why he does certain things, which I think most people will find of value.

B00009W0U4|4.0|I have very mixed feelings about this film. If you are prone to motion sickness or fast, unpredictable camera movements make you uncomfortable, DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM. I cannot say that strong enough. Aside from that caveat it is a very interesting film. It seems to be a realistic look at an horrific event and the immediate effects on a small group of people. The emotions portrayed and evoked are understandable and palpable. If you can not stomach the dark side of human behavior, however, this film is not for you. It has an intensely graphic rape scene that, while containing little nudity, is simply brutal.
B004KA9MQO|5.0|I absolutely adore this album.  She definitely came with a BANG! I was waiting for this album and the wait was worth it! When you buy this album trust me, you won't regret it.
B0041KKYD8|2.0|Production values and acting are much better than the original but almost every scene is even less plausible than the 1978 version. If you are a big slasher/gore/revenge fan you will probably like the 2010 version more. If you have a few hours and are willing to put up with 70's exploitation production values and acting you will get more out of the original by watching it, then re-watching with Joe Bob Briggs' commentary turned on. As for reviews of the 2010 version that say it is \\"smart\\" and \\"female empowering\\", I find that to be dumbfounding if they are comparing the movie to the real world. By slasher film standards it may be \\"smart\\" though.
1439107955|5.0|My mother was diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer.  Her cancer started as a tumor in the lung and metastasized to her hip and pelvic bones.  I bought this book to gain perspective on the disease.  I wanted to understand the causes and I wanted to understand the treatments.  And more than that, I wanted to understand how the medical profession's approach to cancer has developed over time, so that I might have a critical and informed view of the treatments the doctors might offer.  This is a wonderfully readable book for any informed layman.  It deals with the history of the disease as well as its source in mutations of our own genetic material.  I found it to be very enlightening and very helpful in helping my mother make decisions about her treatment and in answering questions about her cancer.  I would highly recommend this book for anyone that wants to know more about this baffling and complex malady.
142338928X|4.0|I'm so glad I finished this book just as its sequel was being released.  I've already jumped into the second book (which I don't mind telling you is even better).  So just a couple comments and recommendations.    There were a few times reading this book that I thought it could have used some editing and been trimmed down.  But in the end, I feel when you take time to immerse yourself in a story like this, in an entire world like this, longer is better.  If you're not ready for that, then don't pick up a fantasy novel of this size.  This is one of the stories you really don't want to end, so epic is better.    I loved the stories from the University.  Amazing and fun, and slightly unpredictable.  I expected Kvothe to be seen as some great prodigy there, but its not at all what happens.  His battles at the University with his rival are better than his battle with a certain beast in the wilderness in my opinion.    I love the description of magic/sympathy and how that works in these books.  Its very well thought out and seems like it could really happen in a weird way.      Kvothe's constant money troubles are irritating and fun at the same time.  The story is almost more about Kvothe's struggles to meet his tuition than it is about some great quest to avenge his family.    My only small complaint with the book is the authors tendency to point out when he is doing something unexpected.  For example, Kvothe will say, \\"In most stories I would have done [insert some fantasy cliche here], but instead this is what happened.\\"  He points these things out on multiple occasions which kind of becomes the cliche in itself.      Anyway, I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I'll save my five stars for something like Tolkein.  Four stars instead for what is a really great read.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|I'm very happy with this second set, but one thing that is hopefully a fluke is that the first broke--not the electronics and such--but the the very small plastic joint where the left ear cup rotates on the connecting band that goes over ones head. And that was just after a couple months of light use. I didn't toss them about and such. I was careful to put them down easily when not using. Either there was a small flaw in this particular set or in general the design of that plastic molded joint could be improved. But other than that it a super setup for PS3. I don't use my PS3 with a TV.  In fact I use it with a PC monitor. I mostly play PC games, but I prefer PS3 for many of the shooter games like the COD series because PC games servers/admins/hackers and such are all too much for me. And the openess and lack of censorship on the console is more to my liking. Since I'm not using a TV it was a bit of an issue to connect the audio. This headset totally makes that possible and with some dropdown setup boxes in the PS3 settings. I couldn't use the audio before and the monitor has no internal speakers etc. so I could connect this device using the Optical sound out on the PS3 console connection etc, and all works great. Of course as people note there are a lot of wires and such, but thats' OK.  I don't mind. Its necessary for all the controls and useability of this headset. Its great for in game chat, or mute all etc. Seperate volume controls for game versus chat and such. All works just great. Sound is very nice. I couldn't be happier. And the instructions are good for doing the Setup on your PS3 etc--You don't need to be a code monkey or anything. I'm not a techy, just a regular user and I got it working just fine.
B002JCSWV6|5.0|Invictus depicts the beginning of Nelson Mandela's presidency and efforts to reunited post-Apartheit South Africa through support of their rugby team, the Springboks. After the white-supported team was disbanded for poor performance by the newly-black-controlled South African Sports Union, in his first main expenditure of political power, Mandela argues for their reinstatement as a measure to solidify the country's blacks and whites into one population. The film follows Mandela's effort to inspire the Springboks and team captain François Pienaar through his stories of personal struggle and his wisdom, turning around their season and getting a shot at the Rugby World Cup. A central theme is Mandela's compassion to the country's white population and efforts to bring the country together. Although Freeman's American accent slips through in a few places, it's a believably warming and bright tale which leaves the viewer feeling satisfied and enlightened.

B000FC12Z0|5.0|So I have rated this title 5 stars for the story, however I feel that the Kindle edition deserves four stars for these (relatively minor) reasons:<br /><br />1) There were randomly missing spaces between some words (5-6 times or so in the whole book). This never impeded understanding, but I did find it a minor distraction/annoyance. I have no idea if this is also true of the print copy of the book or not.<br /><br />2) I wish this edition had footnotes with French translations for those of us who are a little rusty in the subject. The usage of French throughout the book is minimal, and really you can probably get the general gist from the context in most cases, but as I like to know exactly what is being said I was still pulling out my phone to use Google translate as I read.

B00003CXA6|5.0|A VERY faithful retelling of both the novel & the historical event! In my opinion the only thing missing would have been to show General Ewell's failure to press the attack at the end of the day on July 1st.  Lee wanted him to take Cemetery Ridge once Buford & Reynolds' troops were in retreat and Ewell was far too tentative and failed to do so.  I would argue that was the single most critical event that lead to disaster for Lee's army.  I would disagree with the reviews that criticize Martin Sheen's portrayal of Lee.  Lee tended to be a somewhat melancholy temperament who, while a brilliant tactician, benefitted enormously from the aggressiveness of General Thomas \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson.  Since Gettysburg was the first major engagement after Jackson's death just two months earlier and who, Gen. Lee described as his 'right arm', was a bit more tentative than he might ordinarily be.  Additionally, I would argue that was compounded by his instructions to General Longstreet to remain behind and not personally oversee forward areas of the battlefield which was his habit.  I would say that, chronologically, Robert Duvall's portrayal of Lee in Gods & Generals was more accurate for THAT moment in time and that Sheen's portrayal reflected a changed man, a bit more tentative after losing his best battlefield commander 51 days earlier.  Other than a small quibble over which details were included, the movie is well-acted, and develops the battle and events exceedingly well.  It is also enhanced with an excellent score! The only requirement is that you have the stamina and attention span to follow the account for the 4+ hours of running time.  Fantastic for the Civil War buff or military history or war drama fan. Excellent for those who are curious enough to sit through it. Since this single battle is perhaps the most crucial event in American history successive to the completion of the Constitution in regards to shaping what the United States was and would become, it deserves theattention of anyone who wants to understand the men and events of those fateful days.
B002ZG98Z0|3.0|The Sex in the City series ended with a fairy tale ending that most of us were satisfied with.  The two movies that have come out since were just unnecessary and really added little to the franchise except disenchantment for most of us fans.       A nod to the 2009/2010 recession was given in this production in that they talked about it though you would hardly know it since all of our gals and their friends seem to live extraordinarily wealthy life styles.  Take-out from a Japanese fusion restaurant and Liza Minnelli performing at a wedding is hardly cutting costs. (Okay, I get it - we don't want to see our girls shopping at Costco or eating Hamburger Helper.).  It was sort of fun seeing the girls again for the fashions, the beautiful apartments and locales but other than that, not so much fun (and maybe a little depressing?).     We meet the girls again at the wedding of Stanford and Anthony (hence Liza).  Samantha is staving off the throes of menopause with a gazillion herbal remedies.  Charlotte has a braless nanny and Miranda is having problems with her office.  Carrie and her husband, John Preston (have so much trouble calling him anything but \\"Big\\") are seemingly happy though they are found defending their childless marriage to another couple.  Are Carrie and John falling into a rut?  Is the honeymoon wearing off?  Well, just in time Samantha is offered an opportunity to  do PR for a luxurious hotel in Dubai.  Trip time with all expenses paid!  Let the contrived situations begin!    All in all, this was not a horrible movie.  It had it's moments but there was just no real reason to put another installment on the big screen again.

0061726826|3.0|Definitely a good book, but nothing terribly new or groundbreaking about the premise.  If anything, it reminded me of a gateway book to \\"Brave New World\\" and \\"1984\\".    I really enjoy Oliver's writing, and she does a great job of setting her stories up for fantastic finishes... I just don't think she delivers on those endings.  Both \\"Before I Fall\\" and \\"Delirum\\" left me going 'really?  That's all you've got?'  I think stronger endings would have worked wonders for both novels.

030746363X|3.0|I don't often review things on Amazon, but with the amount of hype and number of 5 star reviews for this book, I wanted to weigh in. The book is a breeze to read,with a fairly large typeface and 1.5x spacing throughout - despite the 500+ pages in it, you'll read the different sections in no time.    Ferriss is obviously a good researcher and a willing subject for his own experiments and he's clearly read up on a lot of things - the problem arises when he tries to meld them together. In terms of diet, Ferriss calls his approach the \\"slow carb\\" approach, which is basically a protein rich diet that avoids carbs like sugars, breads, pastas, and allows lentils, beans, and many vegetables. This is a similar diet to that put forth by several others, most notably Gary Taubes in \\"Good Calories, Bad Calories\\" and \\"Why We Get Fat.\\"    The problem I see is that Ferriss regurgitates this information without understanding it. He properly demonizes sugars and breads, but doesn't grasp the real point behind Taubes' research, even though Ferriss mentions his admiration for Taubes in the book. Case in point: Ferriss talks about eating egg white omelettes, or using egg whites, or using just one or two yolks. If you're arguing against calorie restriction (as Taubes and Ferriss do), excluding the yolks doesn't make sense. If you're arguing against carbs and not fat/cholesterol, excluding the yolks doesn't make sense. If you follow Taubes' research, there is no reason to waste the yolk. There is no reason, really, to ever avoid protein or fat, only sugar and grains.    For someone to embrace Taubes' research, but then recommend this as the diet, it doesn't really mesh with either the no-reduced-calorie message or the fat-isn't-bad message.    After you finish with the weight loss sections and exercise sections, the 4-Hour Body is basically a tome of useless information. I for one have no interest in sprinting faster, swimming faster, injecting myself with 18 needles, going abroad for medical operations, or focusing on the upper left quadrant of the clitoris.     In his \\"pay for your vacation with medical\\" stuff section, it's misleading. You don't earn any money in anyway, all you do is potentially save some money by going abroad for your tests and procedures. Though if you have good health insurance, that too is probably unnecessary.    In the sex section, once he describes how he heard the \\"upper left quadrant\\" of the clitoris is the most sensitive, I was pretty sure I didn't need to take his advice on sex. Unless you're using tiny electrodes or a q-tip, I'd safely say the average man's finger is probably incapable of touching just the sole area.    In summation, the book is a fine read if you view it as a collection of information gathered from around the internet, but its cursory at best. If you're interested in weight loss, you're better off buying a book with a more solid scientific basis (Why We Get Fat) and if you're interested in muscle gain you're better off buying a book with a list of exercises (Encyclopedia of Body Building, Muscle and Fitness Training Notebook), and if you're interested in sex, you're better off just experimenting.
0439023521|5.0|Considering the large amount of hype surrounding The Hunger Games it seems a miracle that I had never heard of it before seeing it on the shelf in a bookstore. I think it's a good thing that I hadn't read the hype because it allowed me to read the book without any preconceived ideas. Which is what I prefer.<br /><br />The cover design of The Hunger Games is very effective and made me pick up the book to see what it was about. The crosshairs centred on a young girl are unnerving, but it's the look on her face that will make you stop and look at the book again. She looks straight out of the cover at you, her gaze challenging and defiant, making you want to meet her and hear her story. The fiery background behind her adds to the feeling of looming danger created by the crosshairs. The bright colour also contrasts well with the darker background of the rest of the cover and draws your eye to the girl and her gaze.<br /><br />With The Hunger Games Suzanne Collins has created something unusual in the Young Adult genre. Her world of Panem is darker and more threatening than many you will come across. It is also unsettlingly real, with the distinction between good and evil less clear-cut than in most books in this genre.<br /><br />The country of Panem exists where America once was. At its heart is the Capitol, the centre of power and money. The Capitol is surrounded by twelve Districts that supply the raw materials that are the source of its wealth. Every year two children, one boy and one girl, from each District are selected to take part in the Hunger Games. There, watched on screens across the country, these children, called tributes, must fight and kill until one winner is left standing. There is no option. Kill or be killed.<br /><br />The idea of the Hunger Games is an unsettling one - that the tributes must fight to the death for the entertainment of others. It is a dark commentary on the world's continuing fascination with reality TV and shows such as Survivor. It was this comparison with modern-day TV that made the premise behind The Hunger Games such an intriguing and unsettling one for me. It s a glimpse at what could pass for entertainment in the future.<br /><br />At the heart of The Hunger Games is Katniss Everdeen, a sixteen-year-old girl from District 12. Katniss is an interesting character. She comes across as older than she is can seem quite hard in her attitudes, but this all stems from her life experiences. Katniss is a survivor and uses her hunting skills to keep her family alive. But when her twelve-year-old sister, Prim, is selected as tribute for this year's Hunger Games, Katniss steps up to take her place. As we follow her through the preparations for the Games and into the arena where the Games are fought we are shown different sides to her personality. I like Katniss. She is a well-rounded character and her determination and love for her family are just two of things that will have you rooting for her throughout the book. She had me behind her from page one.<br /><br />Another character who shines through in The Hunger Games is Peeta Mellark, the second tribute from District 12. Peeta is the local baker's son and while, at first, it seems that he and Katniss have very little in common there is good chemistry between them. Peeta has a more noticeable gentleness to his character than Katniss, but as the Games progress his stronger core is revealed. Peeta and Katniss bring out different aspects of each other's personality that make them both more appealing characters. And Peeta's feelings for Katniss create an interesting dynamic that adds an extra layer to this rich story.<br /><br />Although there is violence in The Hunger Games it is never overly graphic and serves to advance the plot. I admire Suzanne Collins for this. Considering the world she has created it could have been easy to use the violence for its sheer shock factor. But she never does. It all serves the story and that is great writing.<br /><br/>Suzanne Collins has created an unsettling vision of a possible future that had me turning the pages to keep up with the well-paced story. Well worth a read.future that had me turning the pages to keep up with the well-paced story. Well worth a read.
B004JN1D2I|1.0|The series is good, great actually. But I can buy these kindle versions cheaper seperately, or pay half price for printed versions. It's over the top that the electronic format costs double the paperback version. A bundle should save money, it's the point of a bundle.
1416955070|4.0|City of Bones seems to be one of those books that people either love or hate and I'm glad that I finished reading it before seeing any of the forums or reviews. Before I continue with my review I do want to address one of the points that critics of City of Bones seem to repeatedly raise: Cassandra Clare started her writing life in the realm of fan fiction. So what? Just because someone wrote fan fiction does not mean that they can't succeed at writing an original story. I believe that people are entitled to their opinions, but I really don't see how Clare's fan fiction writing past has anything to do with the original world and story she's created. With that out of the way, this review will reflect only my experience of reading City of Bones.<br /><br />I love the cover art for City of Bones. It's unusual and eye-catching - equally effective on a bookshelf or a computer screen. The dark colours of the graveyard in the foreground blend easily into the New York cityscape and finally into the large figure who seems to be rising like the sun over the landscape. I don't normally like covers that cut the head off of people, but in this case it works and lends a sense of mystery to the figure. This cover is an example of great design work. I was, however, disappointed by the blurb on the back cover (see above) - it is far too vague and does nothing to excite my interest in the book. In fact, if the cover hadn't been so interesting I probably would have been reluctant to give it a chance.<br /><br />The first thing I want to discuss is pace. City of Bones starts strong, but just loses momentum about a quarter of the way in. In my opinion this is because, even though the reader is discovering the world at the same time as Clary, there is still quite a lot of info dumping that gets done. I would have preferred it if Clare had fed me the information through the story itself - through overheard conversations, memories or even the often used diary. These moments of world background derailed the great start to the story and the book only recovered about halfway through. This really frustrated me because I had to work to get back into the book before my enjoyment could resurface.<br /><br />I did enjoy Clare's world - where Shadowhunters, humans with angel blood in there veins, protect the world from demons. The Shadowhunters are Nephilim, part human and part angel. City of Bones takes a slightly different approach to the idea of Nephilim and I appreciate the fact that Clare has gone to the effort of creating her own unique world by adapting existing ideas into something slightly different. Even the phrases that the characters use feel natural, but have obviously been created for this world. This takes a lot of work, but it means that the story is not happening in a vacuum and this gives it weight and texture.<br /><br />I am going to confine my discussion of the characters in City of Bones to the three I think had the most impact on the story and will influence the series the most.<br /><br />  1. Clary Fray is a normal human girl who suddenly finds herself in the middle of world she never knew existed. And it seems she belongs there. Clary is an engaging character. She is smart, brave and a talented artist. But one of the greatest things is that she reacts believably to the sudden chaos in her life! There is measurable growth in Clary's character throughout the book as she changes and adapts in response to the situations and people she encounters. I really like to see that in a character.<br /><br />  2. Jace Wayland is a formidable Shadowhunter who is looking to prove himself. When we first meet Jace he comes across as cocky and arrogant. And he really irritated me. But as Clary gets to know him his self-assured veneer slips and Clare allows us to see the character behind the bravado. I much prefer the more rounded personality this gives Jace. He can still be arrogant, but it is balanced by the fear and loneliness that sometimes creeps through.<br /><br />  3. The last character I want to discuss is Simon. He is Clary's best friend and although he's human (a mundane in Shadowhunter terminology) he isn't sidelined as a character. Often protagonists discover a magical world and dismiss everything that is too \\"normal\\" in their lives. But Simon plays an important role in the story - he is Clary's link to her old life, but he is also the voice of reason in the chaos she finds herself in. I liked that Clare left him in as a character and let him find a place in Clary's new world.<br /><br />City of Bones is an exciting read that introduces us to a vibrant new Urban Fantasy world.

0312430000|5.0|This book is about the use of checklists in surgery, but the experiences shared would be applicable in any endeavor (think shopping list!) It was so very helpful in giving a framework in which to make plans. Very simple, but also very powerful. If I have surgery, I hope the surgeon has a checklist!

I am sure there are a lot of similarities to the operation that just took out Bin Laden (and good riddance, may he rot for eternity).

B000WZAE1I|1.0|If you are a fan of the novel Stardust by Neil Gaiman, you will be extremely displeased with this film.  This movie's content has very little in common with the novel; even main themes have been entirely removed.  By lacking these themes, the movie loses much of the motivation and drive the characters originally had.  The movie may be decent in its own right, but having read the novel twice, I was frustrated within the first 5-10 minutes of the film.  So, if you love the novel, don't expect much from the movie but if you love the movie, you'll enjoy the novel even more.

The after market tethers have mixed reviews -- so I am not sure I will be buying one of those. I will try my best to hang on to this one.
B004A8ZWSS|5.0|Totally love Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie this movie brought two of my favorites together in a very well written and wonderfully  filmed movie.   The story line is great, location in Venice simply breath taking and beautiful as the leading lady.   Scotland Yard, french, gangsters and russian mobsters.  All the good stuff in the old classic movies I grew up watching.   Usually used to seeing Angelina in action films so it was a different pace seeing her as such a lady without punching someone in the face.  Johnny playing an ordinary american on holiday was absolutely sweet and endearing, I wanted to be in the seat next to him.    Of course the end of the film, yes was great.  A fitting end to an uncertain adventure.  Reminding me a little of The Saint with Val Kilmer and Elizabeth Shue, another fun move with  a lot of the same characters and great ending.

B00008CMR6|4.0|John Wayne's back in the saddle and the world is okay. Demonstrating that director Howard Hawks isn't at all averse to lifting from his own material, this movie is the second remake of RIO BRAVO (after EL DORADO), and, let's not kid ourselves, it's the least version of all three flicks and the looser adaptation. It's not to say that RIO LOBO isn't a solid western, because it is. The story opens during the last days of the Civil War, as a gang of Confederate soldiers commit a daring train heist and make off with the Union Army's payroll. It's not their first time doing this. Union Army Colonel Cord McNally (John Wayne) nabs the thieving Confederate leader, Captain Pierre Cordona (Jorge Rivero), and yet somehow a friendship is struck up. No hard feelings, then, especially when the war ends soon after.<br /><br />Traitors within the Union Army had been feeding vital information to Captain Cordona, and it's these traitors for whom an incensed Colonel McNally is really gunning. The story picks up some time later as McNally, Cordona, and a spunky girl (Jennifer O'Neill) seeking retribution for her murdered friend converge at Rio Lobo, Texas. There, rough John Wayne justice awaits the Union traitors and the town's crooked sheriff and deputies.<br /><br />You gotta love John Wayne's half-startled, half-exasperated double takes. He comes off as this still very capable man who is constantly bemused by those around him. It's a strong hint that your romantic leading man days are firmly in the rear view mirror when a sexy, young Jennifer O'Neill opts to share your sleeping blankets - instead of, say, the younger Rivero's - because, as she remarks: \\"Well, you're older. You're comfortable.\\" The sub-text being: \\"And you're too old to try any hanky panky.\\" 1970 finds John Wayne at his twilight, long past being spry. The \\"comfortable\\" line becomes a running gag in the film.<br /><br />And yet, even at this stage, the Duke still had what it takes to sell a convincing action sequence. He never did lose that commanding screen presence. Jorge Rivero makes a good second banana, playing the dashing French-Mexican Confederate Captain. Jack Elam has the colorful Walter Brennan cranky old-timer role, and, by the way, I wouldn't be caught dead in a staring contest with Jack Elam. RIO LOBO also benefits from featuring three lovely actresses. Sherry Lansing has a near topless scene, and, for a Rated G flick, this scene is pretty steamy. And \\"steamy\\" is an adjective one rarely bandies about in a John Wayne film (maybe THE QUIET MAN). Anyway, RIO LOBO is an all too familiar oater. Jorge Rivero does fine, but the film suffers some from not having Dean Martin or Robert Mitchum (or, for that matter, Ricky Nelson or James Caan) in supporting roles. In my opinion, John Wayne may have taught himself to become a good actor, but he'd always been a great reactor. As such, he requires a certain caliber of stars to react to for him to really shine. As it is, RIO LOBO is watchable for having the Duke in it, even as aged and physically hampered (read: sick as a dog) and \\"comfortable\\" as he's gotten. Just now, I labeled RIO LOBO an \\"all too familiar oater.\\" But sometimes what we need is the familiarity that only comfort food or your favorite chair or a John Wayne picture can deliver. 3.5 out of 5 stars for this one.He never did lose that commanding screen presence.

B0034GK7DM|5.0|I don't usually write reviews but having finally purchased Easton Corbin's album couldn't resist.  I loved his songs I heard on the radio and wondered what his other songs were like - so I bought the cd. Love them and can't wait to hear more!!  These are songs that will stand the test of time.  Hopefully Nashville will be smart because Easton has the talent to be around for a long time.  I'm the same as other reviewers - I can listen to the cd several times of the day.  In fact, I get bored listening to the songs on the radio and will put in his cd instead - they are so much better than many songs being played on radio.  Can't wait to hear his next album!!!
B002G1YPH0|5.0|One of the best additions to my new PC build the stock AMD heatsink was noisy and not very effective. Temp under heavy use would exceed 140 degrees with the CM 212 the CPU hasn't exceeded 120 degrees and usually stays between 110-115 degrees and runs almost silent. The 212 uses a 120mm fan so it is a large heatsink and the heat is directed to the top of the case so it is not for everyone. The install in my case was easy because I have access to the back of the mother board install from start to finish took no more than fifteen minutes. I'm finding that shopping around helps Amazon saved me fourteen bucks on this product over Newegg.
B0035V35P8|3.0|Ninja Assassin is a strange one. It starts out with a bloody bang that is awesome, but there is no more awesomeness for another forty minutes or so. I was really struggling to stay awake while watching the boring plot unravel with boring characters. The gore is pretty much the only thing about Ninja Assassin that I liked. Everything else is deadly dull. Where's Bruce Lee when you need him?

B004G6009U|3.0|Pertaining to quality of the product:  Right out of the box the Bluray didn't work (stays on Disney castle scene with motion but doesn't go past that) so very disappointed in that.  Can't return the product to Amazon since they won't take it back opened (i.e. I'm screwed on the Bluray).  The DVD worked at least so we're not at a total loss.  I need to do some more research to see if there is any way the manufacturer can do something about the bad Bluray - will keep the review posted with findings.    Just hate that you can pay for a product and it won't work out of the box (and quite possibly there isn't anything that can be done about it).  I understand the manufacturer and vendor's point of view that they won't know if the product was really a defect out of the box so therefore they instil a no return policy on an opened item.  Unfortunately that leaves us folks with an actual problem with a paid for manufactured defective product we can do nothing with...not many of us can sell something to someone brand new that is defective and say, \\"sucks to be you eh?\\".        Pertaining to our thoughts on the movie:  Pretty simple, our family loves the movie.  Great flow, good characters, great animation, good story.    My daughter (almost 5) loved it in the theatre and we new we wanted to buy the movie once it got out on DVD/Bluray.  I enjoy watching my daughter act out the scenes from the movie.  The only one to watch out for is the \\"frying pan\\" meet and greet between Rapunzel and Flynn Rider...thank you Nerf!

0982743726|3.0|Bone Sword by the new author Walter Rhein is a exciting action packed sword-fest. The action and violence reminded me a little of Kill Bill.  The book is a real page-turner, and for those that like a lot of action and rather explicit violence, will be a real treat.<br /><br />It is set in a fantasy medieval land, one with little real magic. In fact the forces of the Church has arrayed themselves against what they see as heresy and witchcraft.<br /><br />Our protagonist, Malik,  (more of an anti-hero than a hero) does run into two young peasants who do have the very real power to Heal.  Since Malik is on the run for the rather senseless killing of an obnoxious but well-connected innkeeper, he falls in with the two young peasants/miracle workers, who are on the run from the church.<br /><br />The villains are over the top evil. Torquemada and the Sheriff of Nottingham are pansies compared to Father Ivory and the local Lord. The scenes of depravity, torture and atrocities are also over the top and far too violent for my personal tastes.<br /><br />Other than Malik, little is done to make the other characters three dimensional. However, perhaps that would just get into the way of the action, of which there is plenty. The sword fights and battle scenes are quite well done.<br /><br />I am giving this only *** stars but that is mostly due to my own personal tastes in explicit violence. But for those who do like over the top villains and extreme violence this will be a fun read.<br /><br />I rcvd a copy for review.

B0000DYKET|4.0|These are the original high quality Keen Sandals. Heavy gauge sole, strong construction, compressible foot bed for comfort. After being to the store yesterday where they have a display of new Keen sandals I was appalled at how poorly constructed the new version is...the plastic is akin to the stuff they use on flip flops, the upper construction enters the shoe a full 1/4 from the edge, overall a cheap shadow of these shoes. Hopefully Keen will not go the way of so many other shoe companies and cheapen their shoes to the point of undesirability. You may want to consider an extra pair if you hope to find them again in the future.
B001NLKZUA|4.0|I had heard about this book before and I wanted to check it out. I will say it can have a similar feel to twilight, (hence Stephanie Meyer's praise on the cover). There were a number of times when I wanted to skim over another part where someone is described in appearance, just so that the audience doesn't forget how gorgeous they are. Just a bit annoying, but not enough to make me discontinue my reading. And I will say that the story itself is really enthralling. Secondly some of the side characters became more of my focus because of how interesting their story became. On the whole, I really liked all of the books, (which I've read so far) and I would suggest this read to anyone looking for a romance with some real action in it. :-)
B0035XQW74|5.0|Gerard Butler (\\"The Phantom Of The Opera\\") and Academy Award winner Jaime Foxx (\\"Collateral\\") ignite the screen in the latest thriller from F. Gary Gray (\\"The Italian Job\\"). The movie makes you ponder how far is too far to get justice for the ones you love, and how clear-cut the line between good & evil is. Riveting from beginning to end. MILD SPOILER ALERT!!! In the end, the lesson is learned. MILD SPOILER ALERT OVER!!! MAJOR SPOILER ALERT!!! The movie should have shown what happened when Clyde set off the bomb at the end of the movie. MAJOR SPOILER ALERT OVER!!! Get ready to root for the criminal... or is he a criminal? Are we? Should have been rated PG-13.

I have given this to my mother-in-law (who hates science fiction),and most recently to my 14 year old niece and many others over the years[[ASIN:0425188809 Watchers]]. They have all loved this book!
0316069485|2.0|I eat the Harry Bosch books like candy and only read the Haller ones because I knew Bosch made an appearance. That said I enjoyed the first two Lincoln Lawyer novels pretty well. This one had more Bosch but the ending was pretty awful. It's like the author had no idea what to do and said, \\"OK, let's just get it over with and the heck with all that drama beforehand.\\" I can't recommend it. Read a different Connelly book.

0143117009|4.0|Diamond this time writes writes of societies that failed in the past (Easter Island, Mayas), or suffered unique failures or challenges in the present (Rwanda/China) with  practical lessons (Business & the Environment, Disastrous Decisions). My motivation for reading this book was to learn more about the societies that virtually disappeared, these included Easter Island, Pitcairn Island, Anasazi and the Mayas. Diamond provides general themes for failure; environmental, over population, failed interdependencies, over use of resources, etc. Ironically, he starts off with of all places Colorado in an area where Lewis & Clark traveled through the Missoula area. Diamond writes of the population changes from middle class to rich effecting land values, mine run off polluting streams, introduction of new unfriendly biologically elements (fish eating fish, choking weeds), soil damage from salinity etc. From there he proceeds to discuss many fascinating societies that literally disappeared and these I fond most fascinating since their foot prints are visible but what happened has been more a mystery. It is amazing that polynesians could travel to such as isolated islands and initially sustain themselves very well although in many cases isolated by over a thousand miles across open ocean utilizing canoe catamarans. The Anasazi and the Mayans is also quite fascinating, the Anasazi in particular for me since I have viewed some of their ruins and Diamond points out the possible effects of climate change, misuse of water supplies or irrigation etc. And the sadness of violence that in some cases resulted inn cannibalism.  A lot of these issues roll into future situations and of course many are more complex such as the issues in China. The book, not counting footnotes and index over 500 pages. A lot of lessons from history and destructive repetitive elements  that need to be appreciated to avoid the drastic mistakes today.

0316044695|4.0|This story gives a great front seat view of a heartbreaking survivor's story.  The author does a fantastic job of showing the guts and unparalleled strength it takes to become a Navy SEAL.  The author's account of the story gives a detailed look of what it took to survive Operation Redwing.  I did question some parts of the story since it was so detailed.  I wonder how much is 100% accurate compared to being a little dramatic because he went through so much just to survive.  However, he does a great job of allowing you to see it all happen in your head.  I was a little turned off by the political rants in the book.  Being a veteran, I'm never thought \\"Would the liberal media throw me under the bus if I take this shot\\" went through my mind.  Even if that was the case, I didn't see a place for political messages in this book.   Overall, this is a great book that will hit you emotionally, and it's a constant reminder of why I'm glad that there are soldiers this well trained for the U.S. Army.

0385334206|5.0|Breakfast of Champions was a book by Kurt Vonnegut.    That's really all I have to say about the book to make it what it is. It's impolite, but acceptable. It was meant to be both at the same time, and that's what it was. It was everywhere but on the page. There wasn't for one second when I was reading that book that I thought of it as a book. I thought of it as an idea, or a million different ideas, which I believe is the way that the book was meant to be taken. A different view for every subject that has a view.    What lots of people seem to say about this book is that it is a symbol for something. A story about the tragedies of war, of mental illness, about how life can change you, about coincidence. People try and find meaning in this book. They call it literature, and give it importance, and give it fancy titles and symbolism that is everything they think it is, that they want it to be, much like the lives of people in Midland City.    I believe this book was intended for everyone to read, if not for everyone to understand. It gives perspectives that only someone like Kurt Vonnegut would think of. That being, no one else.    The titles 'Breakfast of Champions' and 'Goodbye, Blue Monday' both fit the story if you read it. Seemingly interesting as well, to those who don't know the story behind it. Part of which is what made me pick it up.    The way that Kurt puts himself in his books to further the story is what gives them his personal style, and which is particularly evident in this novel of his. He isn't afraid to stray from the conventions of rules of grammar, or typical book structure. A drawing here and there to further illustrate the point gives it not meaning but voice.  Conventions aside; This story, this book, this philosophy gives thought, gives a closer look to aspects of daily life which most don't think about. And for those who aren't trying to look to deep into the pages, but just looking for something to pass the time, it's still a good read.

B0032UYFA6|5.0|I love that shows like Breaking Bad aren't afraid to approach \\"the line\\" and even sneak their toes over it, especially with a touchy subject like dealing drugs.  When I first started watching, I was dying to know how the producers got this show picked up, given all the trouble this country has had with meth. The producers of the show recently appeared on  [[ASIN:B004VSZDP4 Breaking Bad: Cast & Creators Live at the Paley Center]] and give great insight to the on-going process of allowing the show to evolve without breaking (too many) boundaries.  The Porta-Potty story is hysterical - some actors go to crazy lengths to prove their dedication to the craft!
0670022411|5.0|I can't understand the negative comments! The scientific aspect of the book is nothing above a general (common sense) knowledge that the average person could easily understand, and certainly isn't a huge part of the story. The story and characters kept me engaged in thought and wonder the entire read! The only negative thing I can say is that the next book in the series won't be released for over a year. It really hurts to wait that long, but I know it will be well worth the wait!

0553801503|2.0|I found this to be the least enjoyable of the books in this series.   Where the other books were page turners, i found this one to go on and on about characters that were not compelling and i had little love of.  I also found the attention paid to new character did little to add to the major themes of the book, i actually found it very distracting.
1594744769|5.0|This was one of those books that caught me by having a picture on the front that was enticing and then furthering that by having the promise of interesting pictures. To be honest, this made me think of The Pressed Fairy Book because of the idea and the picture, taking the land of misfit toys and almost applying it to people.<br /><br />what we have is a kid who wants to have an interesting life. an interesting life is comprised of interesting things, and those are normally adventures. Well, an island somewhere near Wales is the place for that to occur, and going there unveils a rather interesting place.<br /><br />Let me first say that some of the photographs are interesting and they fit the story well. A few hit with the \\"it is a floating baby again\\" kind of feel before long, however, and that did not thrill me. Personally, I wanted some more of the oddities and I got them. There are a few i would like to write about but it feels like having a spoiler and I think that doing that would be really close to spoiling a part of a book with a nice addition. I would hate that.<br /><br />The author themselves have a nice way of going about the book. I normally look at style, which i liked, the goal, which worked out, and the story itself, which was something I did not expect. I thought it might be what it is - an book of weird people - but it is a little more than that. I think that is nice, too, and even better when you have something out of the ordinary. Too many books stick to the expected but i thought this was fun and different. Again, the writing was nice.<br /><br />I would hit this with a 5/5, adding that I would make certain the book sounds good before i get it. I also would add that odd pictures might be a disappointment if you buy for that. There are a few fun ones but some are just photoshop with a little bit of imagination. Cute, sometimes, but not the tempest of oddity I longed for. Still, it is a book and not just a curiosity.<br /><br />Thank you for your time.

B004NS710C|5.0|I had no interest in seeing this, another runaway train movie.  I happened to be at the library and it happened to be there, and my husband had recently mentioned someone said it was good, so I borrowed it.<br />For once, we were not disappointed.  Granted, when you go into a movie not expecting anything it makes it easier for the movie to impress you.<br />I liked the characters, I liked the action.  Of course you knew the early attempts to stop the train would fail, otherwise there wouldn't be anymore movie.  However it was still a good action movie that kept your interest and entertained the whole way through.<br />I would recommend this movie, however I am not sure its a movie you could enjoy as much the second time.
0385334206|4.0|Kurt Vonnegut's novel Breakfast of Champions is a satirical compilation of his many harsh opinions and critiques of American society including sex, drugs, mental illness, and the nation in general. This novel should be read by anyone from age 16 to above who enjoy satire, humor, and a light, easy read. The title, as Vonnegut takes extra time explaining, has nothing to do with the cereal and is not affiliated in any way with General Mills. After reading the novel, it is not clear as to why he chose this as the title. It could be that the slogan \\"breakfast of champions\\" is a widely popularized phrase in America, or that the novel is simply the breakfast of champions because the reader will gain so much insight to the faults of American society.   The most interesting aspects of the book were the illustrations and the side comments Vonnegut inserted for many random things. The illustrations made the book a fun, easy read. Vonnegut put illustrations in this novel to give hints as to how he saw the world, which is very abstract and humorous. The illustrations are anything from a sign on the side of the street, to a drawing of a bug form of a beetle and the car form of a beetle. His brief explanations of random events and items were at first confusing, but then greatly appreciated.   The most exciting part of the book was the ending because the whole book led up to and gave hints to what was going to happen in the end. Throughout the novel, the reader knows that Dwayne Hoover is going to go insane and hurt a bunch of people. It was hilarious to actually read about it, because of his state of mind during the time.   Vonnegut is known for his satirical humor. This novel makes the reader think about aspects of American life which he questions, and the reader can formulate their own opinions with consideration of his. Also, Vonnegut pokes fun at historical events around the world, however serious they may be. The only thing that I did not like about the novel was how Vonnegut jumps around from character to character at the most random times. It made if confusing and hard to follow. Also, Vonnegut could have gone without giving away the ending of the novel at the beginning.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Adele's songs seems to carry a calm  yet invigorating tune that carry you right through to the very last song! There are no tracks to skip or tracks that are just ok. They all seem to flow seamlessly without flaw. This album is definitely a remarkable in that it should be up for lots of awards on the next Grammys without a doubt. I am so happy I discovered this album, because it will be on repeat for awhile for me. Adele is definitely a phenomenal artist who has even greater things coming if that is even possible!
B003UESJHO|4.0|The Fighter' breathes a bit of fresh air into the subject.  That isn't to say that the film is without its detractors, for it has those, but for the most part this is a fun and exciting ride that contains sharp notes that accentuate what could have been a `far too familiar' ride through `familiar territory'.<br /><br />`The Fighter', which probably should have been called `The Fighters', tells the dual story of Micky Ward and Dicky Eklund; two brothers with similar dreams and differing setbacks.  Dicky was a onetime boxing champ who lives in his glory days by abusing drugs.  Micky, his younger brother, strives for a glimmer of what his brother had, but his volatile relationship with his family (namely his mother) make it increasingly more difficult for him to capitalize on his potential.  Once Micky meets and falls for spitfire bartender Charlene, his life starts to change and his career starts to take off as he begins to take pride in his own future.  But, family is always lurking around the corner, and soon Micky knows he'll need to fuse his two lives together.<br /><br />There really isn't anything `new' about `The Fighter'.  The story seems rehashed from nearly every other `semi-popular' sports film ever made.  It is a formula that is rarely messed with (although it could use a facelift).  But, with generously crafted performances, a smart (and fluid) script and some keen direction, `The Fighter' feels far fresher than it really is.<br /><br />Christian Bale and Mark Wahlberg are sensationally good here, especially Bale who just tears into the scenery and his character with reckless abandon.  He inhales every ounce of character to be created and spits it out with every tick and reflex and emotional complexity intact.  With a character like Dicky (drug addled failure) there is no room for subtlety, but there is a need to remain authentic, and Christian Bale delivers flawlessly.  Wahlberg had the difficult assignment of not getting lost in the antics of the actors around him (mainly Bale and Leo) and he manages to do just that.  Amy Adams is also wonderful, changing up her own pace and taking on a character that is unlike any she's tackled in the past.  She is feisty and sexy and all around undeniable.  I loved the paternal warmth that Jack McGee was able to pull out of such a small role as well.  Now, there is much debate about Melissa Leo.  Yes, she was entertaining and engrossing and yet she was shamelessly skin deep and lacked the depth and complexity that the rest of her co-stars brought to the role.  I was not a fan of her Oscar win, despite the fact that her performance was `good'.<br /><br />In the end, `The Fighter' isn't a total knockout, but it has something special, something extra that makes it stand out amongst a crowd of similarly themed films.  You can feel the passion in the film, a passion that is hard to fake.and Leo) and he manages to do just that.

B0041KKYDI|5.0|There are a lot of things about `127 Hours' that should not work.  We know the ending before the film begins.  In fact, that true story that surrounds Aron's survival is the whole `selling point' to seeing the film.  The film basically consists of one actor stuck in one space for an hour's running time.  The film relies almost solely on that actor's charisma and a barrage of flashbacks to keep us entertained.  Flashbacks are always tricky, but more alarming is that that actor is James Franco, and he doesn't have the best track-record of carrying a film (honestly, before 2008 I considered him a joke).  Even the films frantic editing (Danny Boyle trademark) could be seen as gimmicky when considering the film's subject matter.<br /><br />And yet, every element of this film works like magic.<br /><br />The film takes place over the 127 hours that Aron Ralston spent trapped with his arm wedged between a rock and a, well, rock before he finally sawed his arm off with a dull blade.  In that time he reflected on his life, the time wasted and relationships left un-nurtured and he kept a video diary of his revelations.<br /><br />I don't know if I can really explain how unexpected this film really was for me.  Like I mentioned, there is just a lot about this film that shouldn't work.  The whole nature of the film tends to lend itself to `forgettable schmaltz' and yet it really rises above all of that.  Taking the film's opening sequences to establish the `wild child' and `reckless nature' of Aron Ralston, and using his trademark editing as an aid, Boyle creates a force in this film.  With sweeping cinematography that weaves in and out of caverns and crevices; with a booming soundtrack that captures the spirit of adventure; with split screen shots that fall with ease over every frame...it just all works.<br /><br />And then you have James Franco, who just OWNS this film.<br /><br />I was so iffy about this performance.  I've liked him before, especially in 2008's `Milk' (where he was arguably the best of the ensemble), but my overall impression of James Franco is `overrated'.  I mean, the majority of his films are terrible, and he's never been too great in them.  What he does with this performance though is outstanding.  He drips with charisma and charm and evokes such emotional textures out of Aron.  His video entries are masterful because he taps into the raw despair of his situation with such calm and unnerving understanding.  He has moments of delusion that add flair to his performance, and then of course there is his backslide into panic that results in his eventual act of self-preservation.<br /><br />In the end, I highly recommend this film.  It holds our interest despite the initial detractors, proving that it isn't the story being told but THE WAY YOU TELL IT, and Boyle rebounds well to tell a magnificent story in a magnificent way (and this is coming from a guy who strongly disliked `Slumdog Millionaire').e), but my overall impression of James Franco is `overrated'.

B003UESJH4|3.0|All bitterness aside, `The King's Speech' borders on a delightfully fine film.  It's well paced and acted and unusually witty in certain areas.  At the end of the viewing experience you won't feel the uproarious amount of inner-triumph that the promotional campaign tried to shove down your throat, but you will be wearing a smile; and why not.<br /><br />`The King's Speech' has charm.<br /><br />The film, which could have very easily become a redundant bore, has nicely placed delicate touches that make it palatable; a twinkle of charm and grace lacing most scenes.  The performances as a whole are beautifully restrained, adding a realism to each note.  Colin Firth is VERY good, as is Geoffrey Rush (who pulls back on his usual hamminess to deliver a simple yet refined performance).  One cannot ignore the fact that the film is beautiful to look at.  The cinematography is sharp and sweeping, the costumes are authentic and eye catching and the production design (THOSE WALLS) is just pitch perfect.  Understanding that the subject matter is a stretch, the production team worked their backsides off to create a visually arresting atmosphere, and it shows.<br /><br />Here's my issue; `The King's Speech', while `quote-unquote' delightful, is also teetering on elevated mediocrity.<br /><br />Let me take you back a few months to when `The King's Speech' was released in the theaters and there was that huge push to garner it the big Oscar wins (namely Best Picture and Best Director).  The competition was scarce.  In fact, there was only ONE film in the way; `The Social Network'.  In an attempt to dethrone what seemed infallible, The Weinstein Company (buying Oscars left and right) released a series of ads claiming this film to be a total `triumph of the human spirit'.  You saw countless people (obviously paid actors) claiming how this film changed their lives and makes a difference and all that `yadda yadda yadda'.  In other words; `The King's Speech' is the second coming.  The truth of the matter is that the film is pretty but somewhat vapid.  When all is said and done, you walk away thinking \\"was that it?\\" and wondering what all the hoopla was about.  I understand Firth's Oscar and I understand the nominations (most of them at least) but I'll never understand how a film with very little depth could manage what this film did.  I understand the whole idea that watching someone overcome their seemingly small obstacles can be encouraging and uplifting, but even the way that it is presented in the film borders on the absurd (placing more weight on his speech than the imposing war was kind of ridiculous).  While it bypasses the redundancy for the most part, it also loses some connective tissue in the process.<br /><br />In the end, `The King's Speech' is a fine film that will make you smile, but that is all.

Written less like a textbook, and more like a collection of essays, this book provides the reader with much common sense economic education. It is written from the point of view of a fiscal conservative, but it in no way bent toward the Republican Party. If anything, it is Liberterian in nature, and just is packed full of solid reason. It's an easy, enjoyable read, and should be a \\"must read\\" for anyone looking for a basic primer in some essentials of economics.
B002ZCY7SW|3.0|SPOILS<br /><br />This last Season of 24 was,a t least, honest to the parameters developed by the show itself. Technically, it was a monstrous achievment. To make a whole show wiht lots and lots of location shooting in New York without the actor even getting near New York was outstanding and very rare for a TV show. This must have been indeed one of the costlier prime time TV shows ever.<br /><br />However, there was something, let's say, weird here. Let's go:<br /><br />a. Kate Sackhoff: as annoying as she was in Galactica. Also, how, HOW someone with a past criminal record can simply forge a new identity and get a high-position job at CTU?! Well, like I said begfore, this seems honest to the premises of the show... IN all the seasons, CTU seemed easier to infiltrate than to assault a candy store...<br /><br />b. Hastings: one of the best CTU leaders ever, was sacked from the show.<br /><br />c. Jack's killing spree: that was annoying, really annoying. But people seem to think it was all because the murder of Rene Walker, but it was not. The trigger that made him go crazy (more crazy, I mean) was the President of the United States ordering him arrested to cover a conspiracy. That was the last straw for a man who did everything in his powers ever to help the US. Anyway, not a good sight. Come one, eviscerating a man?! Also, is the guy a surgeon? He rapidly got the chip the guy had swallowed!<br /><br />d. Logan: you think the guy would be redeemed, but turn into pure evil. And, also, he killed his faithfull assistant (Jason Pillar) for the sake of absolutely nothing!<br /><br />e. In the end, the central character can not even finish the show in a reasonable manner that would indicate he had the possibility of a normal life. No. How has become standards for todays dramas shows, the main character must suffer, otherwise the show is not good... Sad..<br /><br />Good things:<br /><br />a. Freddy Prinze Jr.: I think his Cole Ortiz was good.<br />b. Almost no Kim Bauer.<br />c. Technical proficiency beyond normal standards.<br />d. Actin (no matter how mindless) non stopping,mindless) non stopping,
0375842209|5.0|I am always a fan of a writer who can truly write. This author has a gift and and it is the reader's privilige to share in that gift. To those few negative reviewers who wrote the book off early into their reading, I will admit that it takes 100 pages to really get wrapped up in this story. After that, thought, this well crafted tale pulls you along and you will we disappointed when the ride is over. The book is wrapped up in expert style and you come away feeling that you have just read a fastinating true story, rather then a work of fiction. This book belongs on your bookshelf right next to \\"Milkweed\\" and \\"The Boy in the Striped Pajamas.\\"

0399536108|5.0|Remember the part in the 1999's `American Beauty`, where Kevin Spacey finally snaps, and starts to drastically change his life? What about Ed Norton in Fight Club (same year, in fact)? Why are these great movies so revered? I believe it's because they tap into something we all want, something we all deeply appreciate, but don't know how to act on in our own lives; we all (secretly) wish we had the freedom at work, and we all wish we could be brazenly honest with ourselves, and others, but we live in a society which says we can't.<br /><br />Enter Chris Guillebeau, travel hacker extraordinaire.<br /><br />With `The Art of Non-Conformity', Guillebeau has created,a tight concise guide for redesigning your life. This is a guy that completed University and Grad school in just a few years, and later wrote the whole thing off as `busywork'. What kind of effect do you think that has on a person? Someone who has done all the tests and ticked all the boxes, and still feels ripped off, is not going to continue on the `traditional' career path. So he became and entrepreneur. And with no need for an office, why stick around? He started bouncing around the world, taking mini-retirements (ala Tim Ferriss), and pretty soon was on pace to visit every country in the world (that is, after a 4 year stint in Africa volunteering). You may not be interested in Travel, and that's totally fine, but whatever you dreams are, Chris wants you to start taking them very very seriously and start thinking about your legacy right now. If your goal is interesting enough, people will join. And if you can get people around you excited about your dreams, they will cheer for you, brag about you, and even support you (yes, as in money).<br /><br />But before you get all jazzed about your new army, you have to ask a very tough question, a brutally honest one-a question that, frankly, has been gnawing at me for a while now: Why? Not only is `Why' crucial in your personal life, but in your business life too. Money is not an acceptable response. Why work 14 hr days, when you could work 4 hour days? This is big... because if you don't `know thyself', you'll never find something that you're truly crazily sincerely obsessed with. And that's probably going to be your big dream. Guilleveau believes we are seeking the Experience of being alive. And Guillebeau found that experience in travel. Travelling to a handful of countries, he decided to shoot for a hundred... when he'd done that, he tried to shoot for them all: all 195 of them. I was reminded of a fantastik Simon Sinek talk on how great companies ask Why. Guillebeau even delves into Viktor Frankl's work (one of my heroes), in exploring this question, a very deep investigation into what motivates us.<br /><br />This was the biggest takeaway for me. There are tons of brilliant ideas in here for travel hacking, getting a world-class education on the cheap, and developing an army of supporters (hey, doesn't that remind you of Tribes?), but without answering that central question as to who you really are and what you really want, nothing else matters.<br /><br />The upside, of course, is that once you do answer those questions, you turn the tables on the world (hence the title of the book). Once you flip the script (sorry), you can save time, money, and energy by just doing what you want to do, how you want to do it. Put it this way, if getting good grades and a world-class education, and all the accolades, and acceptable employment that goes with it is (mostly) baloney, then what would you rather be doing? If you've never seriously tried to answer that question, you might be in for a big surprise.<br /><br />More reviews like this at 21tigerble response.

B0034G4OXQ|4.0|This movie spoke to me with the idea of where do we (might) go when we die.  The three stories coming together as one at the end made it easier for me to understand what each person was going through either in their grief or search for the meaning of what they were going through.  It is hard to fathom this unless you have gone through something similar in your own life.  Each of the three main characters had to face rejection, either personally or in their business lives.  Even the little boy felt he was rejected by his mother.  Each wanted answers and I believe in the end they got what they wanted.<br /><br />I liked the way Eastwood wanted us to understand that death and dying isn't the end, but perhaps just another path.  Very spiritual movie in my opinion and I really wish people would have accepted the ideas a bit better, since there are people who have gone through near death experiences for decades. I also like the fact that Eastwood explored something about death since he is 80 and perhaps is ready to let go of what is here on this side.

This CD really proves this! Originally i came across this series of a CD via some specialized SACD Online Purveyors like ElusiveDisc dot com.

So i opted for this amazing collection! Let me tell you those \\"audiophile\\" folks weren't kidding!<br /><br />The sampling the mix and the final CD in this case sound like nothing i heard before! We are talking in a car CD or a bose wave radio system or even the computer speakers and ear phones!<br /><br />Seriously this disc now will open a whole new chapter (and my wallet) in paying attention to sound more! The tracks are very very relaxing too! Most discs like this hardly ever give you a selection of items which all sound and feel amazing!<br /><br />Defintely a new fan of Chesky Production!

0143038095|5.0|The Joy Luck Club is an inspiring and moving novel by Amy Tan. It also extremely powerful because it switches in and out of many realities and time periods--always containing the love of mothers and daughters. The plot contains four Chinese women in pre-1949 China and the lives of their daughters living in California later on. Tan not only captures important moments in the lives of the daughters, but the connections to the past lives of their mothers as well. Amy Tan also does a wonderful job of using descriptive story telling; she deeply empathizes with the women and their daughters. The novel makes the reader feel like they are one with the book, almost like they're actually a part of it. Because the book is about the unique similarities and closeness between mothers and daughters, the audience for the novel would most definitely be mothers and daughters themselves. Any mother or daughter would truly appreciate the density of the two generations of intelligent and beautiful women within the book. Each page can enlighten any ready through its wisdom, pleasure, sadness, and complexity. The storytelling technique of Tan is so honest, moving, and impressive--it makes the reader wish that the book would never end. Tan uses this great element to describe the fierce love and misunderstandings which lies between the two generations of women and girls. The novel is a masterpiece, a real joy to read.

0439023521|5.0|Great book. It sucks you in and makes it hard to put down. After 2 hours of straight reading, i went immediately on line to buy the other 2. Thank goodness i waited to start reading it until all 3 books had been published.
B004WESFZW|3.0|It is a film with good intentions, but the plot could have gone deeper. I went in expecting more of a thought provoking movie about a mysterious group that knows everything about us and can change our world as they please. within the first thirty minutes we are told what they are in a pretty unexciting way and there is no mystery left to what they are doing throughout the rest of the film. Also I thought the way the bureau was explained was too feel-good yet vague. So the rest of the movie centers around a love story, which never really feels like the actors believe they're destined to be together, however, we are constantly told they are. Towards the end when the two lovers are breaking all the rules to be together it just starts to feel too sappy and fairytale-like, and I mean that there is no rational thought to their decisions, instead it just seems everything works out for the best and they live happily ever after.<br /><br />This movie could have been written a little better, especially to round out the adjustment bureau and make them more interesting. I did like certain concepts they had such as being able to go through one door and exiting another, but I ultimately was disappointed by the way the story was presented. It still was fun to watch though.

0142414999|4.0|Let it Snow contains three short stories that take place in the same town during a blizzard that starts Christmas Eve.<br /><br />Maureen Johnson: Jubilee Express<br />Jubliee's parents are arrested on Christmas Eve, forcing her to take the train to her grandparents' house in Florida. However, the snowstorm forces the train to stop for the night. Jubliee gets off the train when she spots a Waffle House, hoping to find some refuge. She meets a boy instead who insists on bringing her home for the holiday. Could she find love during the holidays that started out so badly?<br /><br />John Green: Cheertastic Christmas Miracle<br />Three best friends sit watching a James Bond movie marathon when they receive a phone call. There are 14 cheerleaders at the Waffle House, having been stranded from the train. Their friend calls them to entice them to the Waffle House. They set out on the journey through the storm. The streets are in no condition to drive, but the three attempt to cross town. The two boys have different thoughts about cheerleaders, but Duke (the girl) is only going for the hash browns. They race to the restaurant, but on the way, things change. Do cheerleaders make the best girlfriends? Or do friends?<br /><br />Lauren Myracle: Patron Saint of Pigs<br />One night at a party, Addie hooks up with another guy in wake of a fight with her boyfriend. Now she's super depressed and isn't sure what to do. She writes her ex-boyfriend an email and hopes that he'll meet her at Starbucks. When he doesn't show, she goes across the street and chops off and dyes her hair. Then she wallows in grief and finally calls her best friends. They come over to console her, but they end up sharing the truth about Addie. She's self-absorbed and doesn't see the world around her. She vows to change, even though she has no idea what they are talking about. As the new day dawns, she comes to understand their concern. Can she become a better person and win back her boyfriend?<br /><br />My Thoughts: I liked this book, which didn't really surprise me but, but generally I do not like short story collections. Mostly because I find that they would make great books instead and I'm always wanting to know more. However, these stories were long enough for me to enjoy the characters, the changes, and the outcomes. I really liked how the stories were all set in the same town and characters from each story appeared in other stories, intermingling in the best of ways. The perfect winter romance tales to enjoy on a cold day.y surprise me but, but generally I do not like short story collections.

B004ETVAH0|5.0|I purchased this fine CD specifically for a long road trip.  At some point during this crucial first listen, I was grinning ear to ear.  It IS that good.  Most of the selections predated the time when I really started listening to rock and roll.  But, they're familiar and instantly appealing.  All the artists sound like they're having a ball, as is the live audience.  Imelda May adds so much to her songs.  Imagine going from the scat style of \\"Hold That Tiger\\" to the dramatic rendering of \\"Walking in the Sand\\", to the smooth \\"How High the Moon\\".  Go for it.

B00003JRCQ|4.0|This version of Persuasion may look a little less glamorous than more recent dramatisations but the acting and cinematography more than make up for it. The story is compelling- what happens after you let the man of your dreams go because you are too young and he is too poor to make a decent husband? It's perfect way to spend a rainy afternoon and a must for those who need a crutch after watching Pride and Prejudice!
B004Q1FDHO|4.0|Gameplay:<br />You play as redneck joe, and the main gameplay is what you'd expect from the title. Throwing dynamite off a boat to catch fish, while shooting birds in the sky. You have to make enough money to pay rent each day, as well as restocking weapons, buying upgrades to weapons and boats, and buying gifts for the girl of your dreams.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Game looks and plays well. Game is way more in-depth than I thought it would be. A lot of upgrades, different areas, missions, weapons. Definitely a decent amount of play time here, and theres a certain novelty to the whole premise of fishing with dynamite.<br /><br />Cons:<br />For $1 this is a great game. It's in depth, and plenty to do..But after you get all the upgrades, i don't think theres a lot of reason to play anymore. The actual gameplay is just ok to me, what makes it really fun is getting enough fish to buy new boats, and upgrade to better weapons. When there's nothing left to buy, i don't have a lot of reasons to \\"catch\\" more fish.<br /><br />Should you buy?<br />Great game for free today, and for $1, if it's sparked your interest at all..definitely get it. it's worth the money, might not last you forever..But it will definitely help you kill sometime, and its an awesome spin on the typical fishing game.<br /><br />Phone: Droid X(Android 2.2.1, Liberty 2.0.1)
B001TH7GT6|5.0|I purchased the RCA component cables from Amazon and they work great!  Easy installation, cables are reinforced (not cheaply made) and the video reception I have now is excellent.  Hooked it up to my DVD recorder and had no problems and their cheaper than ones I priced at retail stores.  Highly recommend.
1439190275|3.0|Once you understand the concept of the diet, seems no need to read another book about it. There is enough on the internet to help guide you through the awareness of the diet. However, it is better than the other book, has menu ideas, and suggestions first-timers may find helpful. It is an o-k book, the diet is difficult but does show results if you can manage the expectations. I've opted against some of the suggestions for a new regime that leaves me losing as much body fat and less hungry.
B0037NEJEU|5.0|Although the series' storyline vaguely resembles the books', I am still a fan -- the characters are eccentric & colourful.  I'm looking forward to viewing the next 2 seasons!

B002GY9F9K|5.0|Ireally liked this.  When I got it I thought it was the complete series and it did complete the story line in this season.  I later discovered there is a second season which I just ordered since I liked the first season so much I'm sure I'll like it too.
B000059T1E|4.0|Staring at Empty Pages, need I go on? That song alone is worth  getting this CD.  They just don't write Albums like they used to.  John Barleycorn is an old alcoholic term, meaning if a bottle  of whiskey was to take on a human form, it would become,  evil \\"John Barleycorn\\".  They also used the JB thing during  the prohibition era.  Traffic isn't even on my top 25 Band list, but almost  any rock album between 1966 to 1974 is a treasure.
B001UV4XHY|3.0|Slow and at times boring. I think WB's attempt to milk the cow by splitting final chapter into part 1 and 2 added much slow and uneventful scenes.
B00006SFLV|5.0|This is one of the the best teen dramas ever!!  It is even better than BH 90210.  The dialogue is real.  The relationships are real.  And the clothes are terrible!!  LOL!!!  The best thing about the show is all of the characters.  You really see some of the characters grow.  It is weird, I was the same age as Angela when this show came out, but I didn't have the attention span to watch a whole episode.  I guess you have to be older to appreciate shows like this.    At the beginning of the show, Sharon is this snobbish popular girl who thinks Rayanne is beneath her.  Towards the end, she actually befriends her.  Even though Sharon is thought of by adults to be a good girl, she still needed some guidance.      I also liked Brian.  He is this totally geeky guy who didn't fit in anywhere.  He feels like he needs to change himself to have friends and maybe even a girlfriend.  He is the total opposite of Ricki.    Ricki is my most favorite character and that is saying a lot since I am totally homophobic.  He is the guy that everyone turns to when they have a problem.  He is really kind and sensitive.  The only thing is that he has this victim's mentality, which won't get you far as an adult.  I think it is great that he is an individual and loves to express himself, but he needs to understand that there are times and places to do that and may want to tone it down.  I thought it was inappropriate that he uses the girls' bathroom at school.    Jordan and Rayanne's characters are people I don't really have much of an opinion on.  Jordan does not seem to be too bright and uses girls and finally decides to get some tutoring after struggling with school for many years.  Rayanne is this fun party girl who has a drinking problem.    Angela is trying to figure out who she is by befriending people who she wasn't friends with in the past.  I think that Angela lacks the maturity to have a romantic relationship and if I were her parents I wouldn't allow her to date.  Angela also is sheltered in the sense that her parents don't expect anything from her.  She doesn't have to pass her classes, do chores at home, or earn some of her own money and she is 15 years old.  She is so sheltered that I don't think that she would do well as an adult.  Angela doesn't seem to know how to set boundaries with her friends-like Sharon does.  There is nothing wrong with her chatting with Rayanne once in awhile and maybe work on a school project together, but Rayanne does have a drinking problem and Angela should keep her distance from her.  Angela also has problems setting boundaries with Jordan; they broke up and she was still doing his homework for him.  And no guy is worth failing a class over-not even Jordan Catalano.    One of the themes of this show that seems to recurring is that teens have it hard and should be sheltered even more than they already are.  Angela's mom worried that her daughter would end up homeless if she didn't constantly nurture their relationship.  Personally, I have seen more people my age fail in life because their parents think that they are going to be kids forever and never encourage them to take responsibility for themselves and they grow up and can't handle being adults.  They are in their 30's and are still dependent on their parents for finances, day care, and such.  The other themes I didn't feel that they were that big of a deal.  Child abuse and alcoholism happens in all generations to certain kids.  Censorship and guns in school weren't really big deals either.      The last thing about classes in the ninties was that it was the years before No Child Left Behind.  Nowadays students really have to study and they can't goof off as much as in the past.
0307265730|5.0|I was mesmerized by the writing in this book.  Many characters were so well drawn that then the story about them came to an end, I was almost in mourning.  I wanted to hear more, to follow them longer.  Although I am not of Bengali (or even Indian) heritage, all these stories spoke to me.  They talk of universal issues, with tenderness and understanding.  A stunningly good book.
B002ZG99QS|3.0|It was Okay but not nearly as good as the previews made it out to be.  The story line was a bit lacking as well.
B002RT2BXQ|1.0|The dialogue is all a bunch of doublespeak.<br /><br />None of the characters are remotely realistic, there's no human nature found in any of them.  Instead the script reads like socrates dialogue, with the viewer being spoonfed completely ridiculous notions.<br /><br />The two main integretists simply come off as hippie idealists, what an irony.  At the same time every single reference to socialist ideas is simply argued with talking points constructed using only straw man arguments, black and white reasoning, and absurd oversimplification.<br /><br />You seriously have to be retarded to take Ayn Rand seriously as a 'philosopher'.  She must have been a total idiot to think ANYTHING in this script made sense.<br /><br />Oh and bonus points for the weak female that must be subjugated and dominated by the male.<br /><br />As an aside, I waited far too long to expose myself to anything Ayn Rand.  I had always read about how all these dumb neo-cons looked up to her and her work.  There's nothing resembling intellect or even common sense here.  Just excuse after excuse for why people shouldn't have to help anyone else but themselves.  Pathetic.

0345440927|5.0|This book was amazing. My toddler is a little older than the target for the book, but it still had some great insights. I wish I had read it when my son was a year old. Would be really helpful for parents first entering the toddler years - 18 months+.    I read the book in a week and I am a single parent of a 3 year old - need I say more?
0156034026|4.0|This is an easy read -- short, exciting, and a stimulating evaluation of what could be a commonplace situation. A thought-provoking description of someone in love with the \\"American dream\\" of success and ambition, who then changes his mind-set, reluctantly, and changes loyalties.  After reading this book and discussing it in our Book Club, I decided I had to buy it, to be able to lend it to friends. Each reader comes to a different conclusion, at the end of the book. Highly recommended.  Lula Reed
B000EGDAI4|5.0|First off, I would immediately recommend getting this album, regardless of how you arrived here.    For music students: Sonny Rollins is a master and it is beneficial to the young jazz musician to transcribe works by the best artists and steal their style. It not only helps you develop your own sound, but also trains your ears to the nuances of jazz. This album is chock full of great tunes to transcribe. St. Thomas, Strode Rode and Blue 7 all are classics in their own right. If you don't want to transcribe, just get it to internalize his sound. He is incredibly lyrical and never loses sight of the head of the tune. Plus there are some of my favorite licks in Strode Rode. This album is also a great place to transcribe because [[ASIN:1423441702 The Best Of Sonny Rollins (Artist Transcriptions)]] contains almost all the tunes from this album. So you can see how close you were in your transcription. One parting word. The easiest way to get better at jazz is to listen to it.     Now, for the listeners: This album provides a great entrance into the 1950's small combo jazz scene. Not only is this album regarded as one of the greatest from this time period (great line up, good tunes), but it is pretty easy to get your head around (but enough here to keep you coming back for years). Let me clarify. In St. Thomas, you can hear what Sonny Rollins is trying to do (periodically echo the head of the tune) and Max roach does the same. This album helped me appreciate drummers (never had before I heard Max Roach on this album). Additionally, Blue 7 is a great tune to learn about jazz. The tune has a 'mysterious feel', especially when it is compared to other blues tunes (not sure how else to say it). This is because it is difficult to tell if Sonny is playing this blues in C or F# (tenor sax tuning). The reason this is important is the 3rd and the 7th are shared between these two keys. While the bass player is playing in the key of C, Sonny is (kind of) playing with both the keys ofC and F#, creating and releasing tension. Comparing this blues tune to other blues tunes can help you hear what artists are trying to do. This really opened up the world of jazz for me. It moved from just a bunch of notes to something so much more.     Overall, this is one of my favorite jazz albums of all time. Get it. Read about it. Learn more about jazz.
0312600844|2.0|The characters in this book are not nearly interesting enough to justify its length and pomposity. In particular the device of Patty's autobiography threatens to topple the book's edifice and is completely unbelievable given the way her character is developed and portrayed elsewhere. The voice of these sections bears no resemblance to the outgoing, oddball, competitive basketball star who is its intended author. In fact, the voice of the Patty sections is completely indistinguishable from that of the narrator of the rest of the novel. Franzen is an interesting and compelling author, and even off his game as here knows how to set a scene and move along a story, which is why I think it deserves at least two stars (and why I had no trouble finishing it).     Meandering, peculiar, and disjointed, this book badly needed a more severe editor. Even its politics are incoherent, which wouldn't be a problem except that it seems to be trying to say something. Darn if I know what it is!
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|I am very pleased with Amazon's service and the Star Trek: TOS Seasons 1-3 Blu ray version.  After reading extensively about all the reviews and trying to decide which format to purchase (either enhanced or enhanced blu ray), I eventually decided the blu ray version was probably the best and the most current format to own at the present time.  I am quite pleased with the purchase and the show looks better than ever.  The colors, shadows and hughs are vivid and the special effects that were redone were handled extremely well and with great care.  The new effects are very respectful of the original effects. I consider myself a true fan of the original Star Trek series -one who is part of the \\"silent majority\\" of Star Trek fans that has never attended a Star Trek convention nor gotten overly bogged down in the show's trivia and gadgetry.  What matters most is the show's underlying themes and message and the wonderful acting and interplay between characters and the show's great stories.  Although some have argued that the enhanced effects are a detraction from the original series, I find the enhancements to be both exhilirating and wonderful and they have re-awakened my long term interest in the original series.  I have thoroughly enjoyed watching the show again with my children who are just discovering Star Trek for the first time and are fast becoming devoted fans. Although one of the boxed set (one out of three) was received slightly damaged during shipping, Amazon's return process was straight-forward and a replacement set was received within a day or two at no extra cost. If you are a sincere fan of the original series, the enhaced version will re-awaken your interest and pleasure in the show.

B0046W5E0Y|5.0|I love this movie, it has such a cute storyline, the animation is beautiful & the whole film was put together very well. I am a huge fan of Disney films still at the age of 23 and I still very much enjoy these types of films. I am very happy Disney has created movies surrounding tinkerbell and the disney fairies, its about time tinkerbell gets her own movies, she is such a cute and loving character. This movie kept my attention and I loved everything about it, the storyline is great and all the characters are adorable. My husband even enjoyed watching this film with me and I have watched this film quite a few times since I have owned it. Who couldn't enjoy a film with animation that is so beautiful and a story that cute. This film would be great for children of all ages, and if your an adult that is a disney fan like I am i think you will defiently find this movie enjoyable. Don't pass this up, at least give it a try, it will not disappoint.
B0030U1TA2|5.0|Gentle Giant's Power and The Glory is a prog masterwork. Proclamation starts the CD out in great fashion.

0061537969|5.0|It's very rare that you can be happy while crying hysterically for about five hours straight, but this book did it for me.  I was crying by the time I got the end of the first chapter.  But I couldn't put it down and stayed up all night until I finished it, with a couple of breaks to settle down.    Is it manipulative?  Yes.  Is the dog-narrator device contrived?  Yes.  Does it hit you over the head with it's life lessons?  Yes.  Is the ending believable?  No.    Any piece of fiction for which I would answer these questions in this way would normally be on my most hated list.  Why instead is this officially one of my favorite books ever?  Because Garth Stein's writing is so elegant that you don't even notice any of the above, and in fact what would normally be a weak device becomes an amazing one.  With one or two sentences he gets you to love a new character as though you'd known them for years.  Every character is relatable without being copies of each other, and Enzo is so very lovable that you'll overlook the fact that he's more intelligent than most people but can't figure out how to communicate a little better.  Also, the life lesson itself, illuminated through racing analogies and the exploration of the role that the love between man and animal takes in our lives, is one that bears repeating again and again, since it's arguably the most important and hardest to learn for us unenlightened humans.  Here's hoping for an Enzo in each of our lives to help illuminate the way.    READ THIS BOOK!

This is not an instruction manual but after reading it, you can write your own plan for improving your memory and amazing everyone you meet.<br /><br /> It is his journey from journalist to mental athlete to US Memory Champ to European ranked memory whiz kid. Joshua shows us all that you don't have to be a genius or a freak to memorize a deck of cards or maybe even ten decks of cards.<br /><br />You set your limits and go for it.<br /><br />A thoroughly enjoyable read.
0064407667|5.0|I believe one of the morals of this story is, be grateful for the parents you have. In a world were \\"there is nothing to eat in the house\\" is too typically just code for \\"there is nothing in the house I am in the mood for\\" this book could potentially offer a shift of perspective for young readers. The writer knows a lot about rhetorical analysis, so this book series might also be useful for kids to learn about the darker sides of communication, which will face them in different situations for the rest of their lives. The bright side of the story is that no matter how unreal the pain and suffering becomes in the lives of the Baudelaire children, they take care of one another and adamantly refuse to take things out on each other.     This might not be the right story book for your kid, each one is unique and needs individual attention and care.

B004QKNXIQ|5.0|I loved this film, I am a 23 yr old woman and I have been a fan of disney and animation films since i have been little and I still find them wonderful to watch. I couldn't wait for this to be released onto DVD and I have to say my expectations were met, this movie was lovely, the animation was so cute, and the storyline was very good. This film never lost my attention and I have actually watched it 3 or 4 times since I have owned it, even my husband enjoyed this film. This movie is a feel-good movie, so if your having a bad day this could cheer you up. This film is targeted for children and I think any child would love this film, the music is put together well and all the characters are well done, the horse was my favorite and he had humorous personality which was fun. I would recommend this to all age groups, this film was put together well, the storyline is great,and you will find a few laughs along the way. I was not a fan of Alice in Wonderland with Johnny Depp, i found that movie wierd and scarey and I think a lot of children would find it frightening, so Im glad Disney put out a film that is the complete opposite and this film blew Alice in Wonderland out of the water, this is now one of my fav. Disney movies.
B0023P1D8S|5.0|This is an absolutely perfect disc of one of the best albums ever made.  The sound on this cd is flawless. My jaw literally dropped the first time I played this disc. I have what I consider to be a more than decent audio system and it will show how bad or good a recording is. This is one of the best I own now. I hope Sabatoge, Sabbath Bloody Sabbath and Volume IV get the same treatment.     I have yet to listem to the disc of extras since I am not a fan of them as a rule. What I do like about the extras is they have their own disc instead of being at the end of the original line-up as is usually the case.    I can't say enough how much I love the job the company did at cleaning up and mixing 40+ year old master tapes. Thank you to whoever did this fine work in resoring one of the best LP's ever made.
0802473156|5.0|Understanding the concepts in this book will help in any relationship, marriage, family, or friendship.  It was written in an easy to understand and entertaining manner too!  I read through it very quickly, it was hard to put down, and I usually don't care for self-help or improvement type books.  I recommend everyone who is married or in a relationship read this.

B001TKMAGW|5.0|This is an absolutely perfect disc of one of the best albums ever made.  The sound on this cd is flawless. My jaw literally dropped the first time I played this disc. I have what I consider to be a more than decent audio system and it will show how bad or good a recording is. This is one of the best I own now. I hope Sabatoge, Sabbath Bloody Sabbath and Volume IV get the same treatment.     I have yet to listem to the disc of extras since I am not a fan of them as a rule. What I do like about the extras is they have their own disc instead of being at the end of the original line-up as is usually the case.    The last thing is this includes the song Evil Woman which I don't think was ever on the US release (bought the LP way back when it first was realesed but was part of the original English version.
B002RI9ZQ8|5.0|This book started off slow but once you get past the 1st few pages it was hard to put down.<br />The only other thing to get past is the long surnames!<br />Other than that I cant wait to start the next book in the series.

What I do like about the out takes is they have their own disc instead of being at the end of the original line-up as is usually the case.    I did listen to the DVD audio disc of the 1974 quadraphonic release.  THis disc was a let down Wish they would have taken the same care with the DVD-A as they did with the origianl release.    I can't say enough how much I love the job the company did at cleaning up and mixing 40+ year old master tapes for the original stereo release. Thank you to whoever did this fine work in resoring one of the best LP's ever made.    I took off one star because the dvd-a sounds worse than the album I owned back in the early '70s. I still think this is worth every penny and plan to pick-up a few more copies for gifts for my metalhead friends.

B004X4R49Y|5.0|I rarely EVER think a modern day movie is good because I love the old classics.  However, this movie tells a compelling story and is done very, very well.
B003UESJH4|4.0|\\"The King's Speech\\" may follow tried and true formulas for success.  Lessons in modern psychology and self-help with such themes as parenting, teaching, and self esteem are more than suggested.  Nevertheless, this is a movie worth watching; one that does not disappoint.<br />The acting is captivating.  Although the movie hints at the failures of many, including King George V, as causes for the dilemma, the real antagonist in the movie is the speech impediment itself.  The movie promotes values--nobility, honor, trust, confidence, and loyalty-that are increasingly lacking in many movies.  Hitler is presented as the historical villain but just as a backdrop primarily in contrast with those values.<br />I found this to be one of the least boring and least disappointing movies I have seen in the past decade, and this was done without nudity, without technology, without gore, and without gimmicks.  While I was aware of the dramatic devices and toward the end was definitely aware of the formulaic approach, I was not offended by a sense of being patronized.  I will keep this movie and watch it from time to time.
0439023513|4.0|In my opinion this great series came to a great conclusion. The dark violent edge into the adult world came a lot stronger then the first two.  As I was reading this book I found myself emotionally involved with the all characters. I questioned my instincts in who to trust numerous times in the story. I believe that the characters had drastic changes in this book. Katniss was a different character from what we saw in the first Hunger Games. She was a lot more adult and was so much more focussed on everyone else besides her self. Also Peeta had completely lost his identity and his love for Katniss. I found it interesting the way Collins has Katniss and Peeta use each other to find their old selves again. In conclusion I found Mockingjay a great ending to a brilliant trilogy. I never though I could be so absorbed into a fictional world.
0380977273|1.0|Except for the first 5 or 10 pages, the book is a terrible read. Bradbury starts well but turns increasingly pretentious and obscure. From the third chapter on, there is at least two metaphors per paragraph, and quite a few of them are undecipherable.
B003Q6D25K|2.0|The first Paranormal Activity won points as much for its originality as for how scary it was. Sadly PA2 is neither very scary nor very original. The film has all the same things that scared us in the first one and as usual everything occurs off camera so we don't see much that is very scary. I laugh at these people who let their video cameras do all the talking and don't consult with anyone who may know more about the issue.    I would tell people to avoid this movie because it is very dull and not very scary.  Watch The Exorcist if you want to see a really scary movie!
B003UESJHO|4.0|...not just a great boxing movie, but a great movie. I've been a Bale fan since American Psycho, and he went nuts here too. Some of his facial expressions in The Fighter are classic. I'll admit too that Mark Walberg has really impressed me throught the years. He doesn't do much, but he does it really well. Seems the Boston area has had its share of movies the past many years. Add this to the great pile of those. Melissa Leo played a very believable trashy and medling mother. She and Bale both won Oscars. Amy Adams also had a super part, and wears black undies well.<br /><br />I'd call this film a must for anybody that likes a good sports drama, great acting, the cast, etc. It might be the best boxing movie since Rocky 14.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie~ I am a huge fan of anything action with a touch of comedy, so this one was perfect for me.  I saw the trailer very early last spring but missed it in the theaters.  I was so excited to see it on DVD that I could not wait to bring it home.  Loved, Loved, Loved Helen Mirren's character.  Boy can I relate to her, evening gown and a .50 cal no better way to spend an evening!  I am so hoping there will be a sequel  to this one.
B002BWP4A6|1.0|I echo what many have said, the movie is incredibly slow, it has scenes that don't seem to have any reason for being in there, and for me some of the acting was stunted.  ****SPOILER ALERT - One thing I do not agree with though for those that have the 1 star review, is that the movie did not have a resolution.  My sister has a degree in forensic science and she will be the first to tell you that many murders are never solved.  Yet many people I think have this false idea from watching all of those cops shows that most are when reality is completely the opposite.  So that this movie ends without anyone really finding out who was behind those criminal acts is not a problem for me.  I can see how it would bother many people that have been conditioned to expect things to be tidied up at the end.<br /><br />However, the movie still didn't sit right with me.  Take for instance the one scene where the Baroness tells the Baron of her affair.  Why?  In real life it makes sense, what sense did this scene serve?  It was not followed up, how did it add to her decision and insistence on leaving?  She had legitimate and real reasons to leave and protect her family.  The way people acted and spoke seemed stunted, I don't know how many pregnant pauses I found in this movie.<br /><br />Some say that this showed the rise of Nazism?  Really, how so?  That some extremely horrible behavior was acted upon in a small town?  How about the blacks that were being lynched here in the US at the time?  Or the other atrocities that were committed here besides those right before WWI.  Did American behavior lead to the rise to Nazism, Communism, or any other thing here in the US?<br /><br />Why is it black and white?  Color didn't exist then?  The movie did explore some complex and incredibly dysfunctional situations and some folks did make an attempt to stand up for themselves, but overall it was quite depressing.  I think there are better movies that can \\"shock\\" you yet teach a lot more than this one does.
B003UESJH4|5.0|One theme of mine is that good acting always beats great special effects. We see that axiom proven with \\"The King's Speech.\\"  It is a movie which moves between being heartbreaking and uplifting. Tom Hooper deserves credit for creating an atypical Hollywood success story.  It is plain that the King truly suffers from his impediment and the rigid class structure of England at the time prevents him from accepting help easily.       Colin Firth and Geoffry Rush are both exceptional in their roles. The atmosphere is very well portrayed and the fact that the King's condition is treated as one which he comes to accept and work with is very inspirational. The friendship between the two is strong, well founded and one of the basics of the film.  It is real and genuine and shows how anything can be overcome.  This is a must see film!

B004K4IZ3G|4.0|Whenever you produce a remake, sequel, or otherwise related movie to an old classic, comparisons are inevitable. Like many of its kind, Tron Legacy can feel less impressive next to the original, but that doesn't mean it's a bad film in its own right.    Visually, Legacy channels much of the spirit of the original film with fantastic updated designs to the landscape, sets, and vehicles present in the film. However, certain other elements have been streamlined, mostly notably the costumes. Whereas in the first film programs would often be seen wearing rather bizarre costumes that formed odd shapes and unique silhouettes filled with complex, circuit-board like design patterns. In this film, everybody wears the same generic body suit with a few conservative light patterns. The handful of characters you see that look different, have a more generic cyber-punk look to them such as loose clothing with basic trim patterns. Often when you see the actors interacting with each other, it looks more like a new matrix movie or a lost star wars episode then Tron.    Story wise while the original film was a wide-arc adventure focusing on the discovery of this new fantasy world. The new film is instead a character-driven story about Sam Flynn, the son of Kevin Flynn from the first film. Pretty much the entire film is told from his perspective, with plenty of drama, romance, and action. As a character development piece it is pretty good, but it missed out on a great deal of potential. `The Grid' is portrayed more as just another alternate dimension rather then being a world inside our computer software, as all the ties that related it to real electronics are gone. Aside from the occasional reference to users and programs, there's no more bits, no more data streams, the internet is never even mentioned. I was personally hoping to see how the new world created in Tron would've evolved over the years, as technology has evolved so far and so fast. Instead we got the story of Sam Flynn. Again, they could've removed the few references to the world established in the first Tron and called it a new Matrix film, and you wouldn't know the difference.    On the other hand, the action sequences in this film are fantastic. The creative team took full advantage of the advanced technology available today and the deep pockets that Disney has. Deadly Discs is given a multiplayer tournament setup, the light bikes race across multiple levels, and the aerial battle at the end is just fantastic!     As far as the extras on this blue ray package, they are all well worth it. Tron Legacy is available in a large number of packages, and I'd strongly advise consumers to take the time to compare and contrast before making their final decision. Do you really need three versions of this film? One on DVD, one on Blue Ray, and on for 3D? Sounds pretty wasteful. And don't even think about the four or five disk sets, that just insane. Save yourself the cash and pick this up on a cheaper set like this one. You can't go wrong when you're saving this kind of money.

1416511946|3.0|I liked the feel and the art of this book almost more than the content. I am a big Nikki Sixx fan so I liked reading about what was going through his mind during his drug days, and it did give me a good look into the mind of a drug addict- I learned a lot from this book. It was depressing though, but that is no surprise, the title says it all! I liked that he let Vanity have her say in the book, although she sounded batty. Interesting read if you are a Motley fan, but it got repetitous: drugs, dry out, drugs, dry out, druggggs!
B004KPLVV8|5.0|Tron was a Disney production that is truly one of a kind, a classic in every sense. It started as an idea: \\"What is it like inside your computer? Is there a world in there? Are there people? What does it look like? What kind of culture would it have?\\" Computers were still a new and fantastic kind of machine in 1982, and it was only natural that it would lead to a new kind of fantasy, something original for people to romanticize over. The creative team behind this production took that concept and ran with it. They visualized what a bit looks like and how it behaves, they defined the physical aspects of a data stream, how programs might interact with each other, and how a world made of light might look.    The artwork of this film is what stands out the most. Computer generated images were new technology at the time and not nearly as impressive as today, but that is only a fraction of what makes this movie stunning. All of the heavily stylized design of the sets to the intricate details of the costumes, which while certainly unconventional for the actors, gave their characters unique and impressionable appearances while making it look as though they were wrapped in a circuit board. Tron had a look that was all its own and no film has managed to duplicate that level of creativity since, and once you see it, it will stay with you forever.    Story-wise the film is an epic tale inside a computer. It focuses more on the fantasy of discovering a new world not outside of our own, but within it. There are heroes and villains in both worlds as the oppressive Master Control Program dominates all other programs on what would come to be known as `The Grid'. It's an adventure in cyberspace filled with action and drama that you will enjoy every second of.    As far as this DVD package of the film goes, it's a great buy. The picture is great, and the extras are fantastic. On top of which, it's a lot cheaper than getting the blue ray edition, and a lot cheaper than one of the combopack that couple it with the new Legacy film. I'd strongly recommend it to everyone.

0060989157|4.0|I think I have heard it all- until I read this book. I was both covering my eyes and laughing at this book. It told the wild stories of Motley Crue's early days and it was just as salacious as one would expect. They lived in complete poverty and got girls to pay for everything, but appeared to be having a ball partying. I liked the fact that the reader is given the point of view from every guy in the band on particular stories, some of them saw it differently than others, which was entertaining. This book was definately a guilty pleasure!

B0041KKYEM|3.0|\\"Black Swan\\" is neither so long nor so glossy as its predecessor, \\"The Red Shoes.\\" Both movies deal with balletic portrayals of fairy tales: the earlier film equates the dancer's life with the fairy tale; \\"Black Swan\\" transforms fairy-tale white into fatal black by having the dancer afflicted with spontaneous bleeding (Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia, or HHT) and bipolarity. Both films have impresarios whose malevolence consists in a devotion to art that, instead of being informative of themselves, is malignantly imposed upon a female dancer.  The cruelty (men's objectification of women) is washed away in the colorful extravaganza of \\"The Red Shoes\\"; but it is painfully and productively exposed against the black ground of \\"Black Swan.\\"  Moira Shearer and Natalie Portman are equally great, however, in effecting the intense integrity of Woman (the divine gender, to which the male is, as Robert Graves makes clear, a frightened adjunct).
B000005RFQ|4.0|Born Again is forever an anomaly within the history of Sabbath's recording career. After the departure of Ronnie James Dio and Vinny Appice, Geezer and Iommi were left with a means to revamp and jump-start the band again. Bill Ward returned after a convalescing and rehabiltation period in his life and Ian Gillan was astonishingly announced as the new frontman within the group. Gillan's fame was, of course, attributed to another british band of Deep Purple fame and while the match-up was seemingly interesting, it was also a bit bizarre.    Strangely enough, the material on here is very strong, for the most part and is a bridge between the former Dio-era and the future of a primarily led Iommi-era. Ward's drumming is paramount on this record and he does one hell of a job smacking the skins on this release; especially on tracks like Hot Line, Digital Bitch, Trashed and Disturbing the Priest. Gillan proves himself more than worthy and while its again, a bit odd to hear him cackling on tracks like Disturbing the Priest(tongue planted firmly in cheek), the title track is quite different than anything Sabbath had ever committed to vinyl before.    Iommi's got a ton of great riffs and hooks all over this recording and the group sounds tight, heavy and powerful. The inbetween \\"texture\\" tracks, as I like to refer them as, The Dark and Stonehendge, kind of recall Vol. 4's FX, and merely provide interludes to Disturbing the Priest and Zero the Hero; in other words, it adds a bit of ambience to the recordings. The album closes out with Keep It Warm which is another churner of sorts and yet, Gillan's subject matter seems a bit out of place with Sabbath's usual themes of darkness underlying the heavy minor chord riffs that are typical of Iommi's nature. Overall, this record is incredibly interesting, even though the mix of the day buries the life out of it. All the guys in the band were horrified by the outcome and by the time the tour had begun, Bill Ward was not involved(Bev Bevan, ex-ELO was recruited), and Gillan had a somewhat hard time adjusting to Geezer and Tony's demands with how a Sabbath singer should be. Therein lies the issue with the recruitment of Ian; here was a singer whom had established himself quite well within the confines of Deep Purple, what in the hell was he really going to bring to Sabbath in terms of what the band had built up before that? He just didn't fit the mold and, in retrospect, all of the guys knew that and have gone on record as stating this as a huge mismatch. The redemption of this fact is simply within the recording of itself; in the studio, it worked really well, but as a long-term situation, it wasn't meant to be, unfortunately. 4 solid stars.

B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Laughed until I peed! Tina is from my hometown and it was great to see all her mentions about her life here in Upper Darby, Pa. This book really gives a glimpse into this funny girl's mind. It has a touch of raunchy, a touch of endearing (about her daughter) and a backstage pass to her shows, SNL and 30 Rock. I especially loved hearing her thoughts about her portayal of Sarah Palin, and being a working mom. She wrote it like she spoke it, so it was easy to hear her voice as I read it. All in all a fantastic and funny read with a feminist's view of the men's world of comedy.

B001GKJ2DY|5.0|Love it! Since it is the flower-children era, the amount of sex-related humor is inappropriate for children, but otherwise a great movie. Can't get enough of the music, and it's a trip to see Pierce and Meryl singing together!
B00479SVBU|2.0|It's a decent piece, but definitely not good enough to justify the $40 price tag, which is almost ten times higher than some other similar products. For its exorbitant price, it has many flaws. First, there is a constant hiss in the background. I tried changing the frequency; the hiss goes away for some time and then returns. Second, the remote is awkward. The buttons must be pressed *hard* to register. Third, the RDS is useless as the screen cannot be read in anything but total darkness. Finally, the 12V adapter is flimsy and easy to knock out of its socket at the slightest touch; sometimes even by road bumps.    I could live with most of these problems if the thing cost $5 or thereabouts, but for $40, I expect a much better product
B000PY52EU|5.0|I am a Samuel L Jackson fan and I liked the storyline of the movie. I would say this movie is not for everyone and the initial reviews were nasty.

0545123275|5.0|WHY DID IT TAKE ME SO LONG TO READ THIS??? I am clearly an idiot. Truth is, I am a vampire fan and when I saw this book I was still grumbling about how much I didn't like Team Jacob from Twilight (Sorry Jacob fans). So I put this book off. Then after reading so many great reviews, I caved, which brings me back to saying, \\"I am clearly an Idiot.\\" How could I have avoided such a fantastic book that is set in my home state of Minnesota!?    One of the things I loved about this book was how each chapter showed the temperature. This proves once and for all that Minnesota is not a frozen wasteland. If I recall, one chapter even displayed a 90 degree temp. THANK YOU MAGGIE FOR DISPELLING THE MYTH!!  Plus, the chapters switch back and forth between Grace and Sam and I really got a feel for their distinct characters.    I will say that I thought Grace was a little on the boring side, but I liked reading her perspective the best. I could see how she felt about the wolves and her developing feelings for a the wolf boy sam. Their plutonic nights in bed together were freaking cute. Its a paranormal romance like no other.    On top of this romance is the mystery of jack and also the hope of a cure to the wolf condition. After finding out the reason for why Grace never changed, it was pretty obvious. But figuring out how to make it work for any one else was the difficult part. The end had me biting my lip. I didn't want to read the parts but couldn't look away!!     This book was awesome. did I say how much it rocked? yeah, it was PHENOM. Pick it up if you haven't already but I feel like I'm the last one to hop on that band wagon....
B0045TQF88|5.0|The Deluxe Edition of Rainbow's Down to Earth gives Ritchie Blackmore fans true insight as to how his songs come together.  In addition to the reissue of the original LP, 2 \\"B\\" sides are added: Weiss Hiem and Bad Girl.

B004TE6F66|5.0|I will start off this review by saying I didn't like it as much as the first. The story was a bit slower. That being said, I still loved this book. And there is a new main character introduced named Cole.<br /><br />Cole rocked. Literally and figuratively. He is really just a damaged guy but underneath his neuroticism, he is a good guy. It's just really hard to see when some one messes up as much as he does. He's dumb when it comes to living his life but smart in terms of book smarts if that makes any sense. Reading from his perspective was really fun and different.<br /><br />Grace and Sam face new struggles in this book. There is something wrong with Grace and she's hiding it from Sam, her parents do not approve of their relationship, Sam is trying to get used to the idea of having a human future, and to top it all off, they have to deal with Cole and keep an eye out for the rest of the wolves. YIKES.<br /><br />Sam's new life is interesting. You really get to see more of who he is besides the wolf now that he has an opportunity. It was nice getting more of a feel for his character. Grace has to kind of lead the way for him and keep getting him to believe that he isn't going to change back. Grace, on the other hand, seems to have more confrontation with her MIA and clueless parents. She tries to keep her illness from being noticed, though not that her parents would notice anyway. Her parents bug me. I secretly wish Grace would just get emancipated.<br /><br />The end threw me for a loop. Or should I say Loup-Garou? Ok, bad werewolf joke. I tried. Anyway, all I'm going to say is that Sam and Grace are going to have some issues to deal with in book 3. Can't wait!!
B000FC1RCI|5.0|this book was quite the page turner. in true christie form she kept me progressing through this book at a steady pace. i was surprised by \\"who dunit.\\"
0061726826|5.0|OMG. This is easily one of my favorite books ever. I mean, WOW. The writing was flawless, the story left me breathless and wanting more. If you haven't already assessed how amazing this book is, I'm telling you now that this is a must read.    Lena lives in this dystopian society where love is considered a sickness. They even have a cure for it and this is something that Lena has no problem with. Now before you go taking issue thinking that she just blindly follows rules and has no qualms about it, you have to realize that this is all she knows. How can she think any differently when she has nothing to compare it to? She doesn't truly know what love is and what it is to love and be loved. Not to mention that this \\"sickness\\" claimed the life of her mother. All she knows is sickness and symptoms so when she meets Alex, her views start to shift. Although she had moments before Alex when she felt she wasn't being true to herself by going along with what society wanted. I think that slightest inkling of doubt is what helped push her over the edge when Alex comes into the picture.    When she begins to feel differently it scares her but she doesn't stop. This is what I loved about Lena. While she isn't some gung-ho heroine, she is brave. She risks her life not only by breaking laws but keeping others' secrets. She was warring with herself the entire book but I got a deep look into Lena as a person and she felt real. All of the characters were beautifully written. Hana, her best friend, was struggling with her own issues of doubt and she was more outwardly enthusiastic about breaking laws. Carol, Lena's Aunt/ caretaker, was such a distant and almost emotionless person that you could really see in depth how the cure affects people. Even minor characters like Lena's cousins, Jenny and Gracie, had a je ne sais quoi that made them memorable.     Her friend Hana gets into this rebellious life style by attending parties and at first, Lena isn't ok with it but she is strangely drawn to it. And then she falls for Alex. He truly is the romantic knight in shining armor. A little bit of a rebel.... Ok, a lot rebel. He's got that good guy/bad boy mojo happening where it's just the right amount to make him totally desirable.    The ending was so intense I was jumping up and down in my seat, biting my nails. It was sad and happy all at the same time. I think I would cry tears of joy if there were a sequel to this because I'm craving more. I read this book in one sitting because I couldn't put it down. Have I convinced you to read it yet? DO IT!! DO IT!! DO IT!!

0385738757|4.0|OH EM GEE!! Where do I begin? well if you have not picked up The Maze Runner yet, please do, because the sequel does not disappoint. The Maze Runner was more of a problem solving book, whereas The Scorch Trials is more of an action book. The Gladers have sort of realized that no matter what they try to solve, something else will be thrown at them and it's always totally unexpected. Oh and more people die. It happens.    Basically this book revolves around the getting to a Safe Haven that requires the Gladers to travel across the Scorch with unknown dangers. And boy, are there dangers.    Minho is my fav. The hilarious and brave leader. I LOVE his character. Every time he talks, it's sarcastic. Thomas isn't really a hilarious kind of guy but he's smart. He's the thinker of the group. Not to mention everything WICKED does seems to go back to Thomas being important.    We also get three new characters in this book-- one who is from another test group who doesn't talk a whole lot and two who are Cranks, which means they have been infected with the disease that ravages the planet. The two Cranks-- one girl, who seems to sort of have a thing for Thomas and a boy, who is the leader of a group of cranks. I like the new editions, though it doesn't exactly make up for the fact the Theresa is missing for most of the book. *GASP* Yeah, she's off somewhere else. It happens early on so this isn't really a spoiler. And I will say that by the end of this book, I did not like her. I won't say why.     Oh and we also get to find out about another test group, simply named Group B. oooOOOOooohh. Mysterious! There are so many other things that happen and I can't really say much more without giving anything away but I really enjoyed this book. You never know what to expect next and it keeps you on your toes.
B004Q1FDHO|2.0|I will say that I did not play this game for very long. Unfortunately it locked up on some pause screen. Since it hadn't impressed me by that point, I did no troubleshooting. The controls were not intuitive and the gestures to do things were too similar that you usually ended up doing something other than what you intended. The only bonus was that I got this on a free day. I would never spend a $1 on this game. I could see fish I wanted to blow up, but getting it to actually throw the dynamite was oddly difficult. I would save your money and time for something else.
B003UESJH4|5.0|Great period piece. Great actors and script. I also liked the directors efforts at historical accuracy as well as  giving a great feel and intimacy to the characters. One of the most enjoyable and satisfying films in years.
B0000029AL|5.0|I knew many people that played this one to pieces literally. Albums worn away from all the times this one hit the grooves. It's just a great early metal classic that stands up well even today unless you are just a thrash fan or something. The band was accused of being like the stones but they were different and quite distinct as this one proves with the classic songs 'mama kin' , 'walkin the dog' , 'one way street' and of course the big hit 'dream on' .  They just put out a great degut cd by any terms and it's still great.
B004L79VUI|5.0|I enjoy listening to each and everyone of Robbie's solo albums. This one just shows how much he has evolved but also shows that he is in a more quiet place in his life. It's melodic, easy to listen-to, beautiful music. And then of course you have his song-writing which always blows your mind. Nice work, Robbie.

0465092764|4.0|This came out the same year that Lee Smolin's The Trouble with Physics (2006) and it carries the same message, namely that particle physicists need to move away from string theory because it is beginning to look like it isn't valid science. The main point in both books is that after two or three decades of work on string theory--or superstring theory, M-theory, brane theory, etc.--string theorists are unable to make any predictions that can be scientifically tested.<br /><br />The deep problem for the reader of either book is that only particle physicists themselves can know whether progress is being made. For the rest of us we have to accept what they say on--dare I use the word?--faith. Without empirical support string theory is, as Woit has it, \\"Not Even Wrong\\" (the phrase is from Wolfgang Pauli).<br /><br />The Preface and the first two chapters up to page 29 are eminently readable and interesting. Starting with Chapter 3 \\"Quantum Theory\\" the book becomes difficult and continues to be more than challenging until Chapter 13 \\"On Beauty and Difficulty\\" beginning on page 193 where it becomes readable again.  The problem? With or without mathematics it really is impossible to make particle physics understandable to a general readership.  Woit tries to make QM and string theory clear without equations and I give him credit for trying. But it is the nature of modern science but especially of something like particle physics that it is impossible to really grasp the subject without years of study.<br /><br />Perhaps the beginnings of trouble for particle physics began in May, 1963 when P.A.M. Dirac famously said \\"It is more important to have beauty in one's equations than to have them fit experiment.\\" (p. 195)  This view, shared in some respects by Einstein, is the source of the problem today.  While it turned out to be true that some mathematical equations that came before experimental support back in the grand old days of physics proved to be valid many did not. And of course it was understood that experimental support would have to follow otherwise the beautiful math would have to be put aside as wrong, arbitrary or perhaps not even wrong.  The interesting thing about the equations in string theory, according to Woit, is that they are not beautiful. (p. 196) I would hasten to point out that beauty is indeed in the eye of the beholder and such claims really get to the heart of the matter: without experimental proof or predictive power, it really doesn't matter from a scientific point of view whether the math is all that beautiful or not.<br /><br />Woit goes into the politics and economics of present day particle physics with his main point being string theorists control access to all the good jobs and that furthermore once you're on the string theory path it is hard to get off because of the enormous commitment in terms of time and energy required. So those people in string theory tend to support the theory despite its lack of empirical support because it is their livelihood and they have almost nowhere else to go because as Woit says, \\"It's the only game in town\\" (see Chapter 16).  Woit compares string theory to postmodern theory in its arrogance saying that \\"In both cases, there are practitioners that revel in the difficulty and obscurity of their research, often being overly impressed with themselves because of this.  The barriers to understanding what this kind of work entails make it very hard for any outsiders to evaluate what, if anything, has been achieved.\\" (p. 202)<br /><br />The title of the next chapter is \\"Is Superstring Theory Science?\\" and Woit's answer is no.  He writes, \\"...superstring theory is at the moment unarguably an example of a theory that can't be falsified, since it makes no predictions.\\" (p. 207) I would add that this is similar to so-called Intelligent Design, another \\"theory\\" that fails because it can't be falsified.  This in a nutshell is why string theory is not science. Here is the situation: youhave a \\"theory,\\" an edifice of equations and ideas about reality.  You have an insolated and esoteric cadre of high priests who are the only ones that have access to this \\"knowledge,\\" and you have to take their word for it being true since they can't prove it.  Maybe it is true, maybe it isn't.  Maybe God did part the waters and maybe the Pope really is infallible in certain matters. But without experimental support none of this is science.<br /><br />Woit goes on to remind us of \\"the Bogdanov affair\\" in which some string theory mumble jumble got past some peer review journal editors.  This sort of thing, reminiscent of the Sokal Hoax from a few years back, suggests that things are indeed getting lax in the same way that postmodern literary journals can be lax since so much of what is expressed is either arbitrary or simply a matter of opinion without any sort of scientific rigor.<br /><br />Woit even cites an anonymous scientist as saying that there is a string theory \\"mafia\\" in charge of the physic departments in our prestigious universities (p. 223).  On the next page he has an \\"excitable\\" \\"Harvard faculty member\\" say that \\"those who criticized the funding of superstring theory were terrorists who deserved to be eliminated by the U.S. military.\\"  Woit adds, \\"I'm afraid he seemed to be serious about this.\\" (p. 224)<br /><br />I have read books by renowned physicists Leonard Susskind and Brian Greene in which they come out strongly in support of string theory and hopeful that it will someday gain some experimental proof or be formulated in such a way that predictions can be made.  But to be candid I feel they are in the unfortunate position of people who have to justify a lifetime of work otherwise admit that they might have better spent their time in other pursuits. The cognitive dissonance they face is difficult to resolve even for august scientists.  Richard Feynman is quoted on page 246 as saying, \\"String theorists make excuses, not predictions.\\"<br /><br />Okay, why does this really matter?  It matters because this unscientific approach from string theory gives aid and comfort to not only postmodernists who believe that all of science is merely a social construction but also to creationists who can now claim that string theory and their intelligent design theory are similar in that neither one is falsifiable. If this is the case, by what authority do we choose one and not the other?  In other words, a non-falsifiable string theory is a retreat from science into something akin to religion.<br /><br />(Note: Thirteen of my books are now available at Amazon including \\"Hard Science and the Unknowable.\\")<br /><br />[[ASIN:1461157064 Hard Science and the Unknowable: reviews by]]ns and ideas about reality.

B004J713JW|5.0|There is nothing wrong with the audio for this BD, to the contrary it is quite exceptional.    In fact the PCM 5.1 is so detailed in clarity and representation of all the musicians involved that I bet those watching from the front row will say they never experienced the concert's sound as clear as this. My Yamaha-Definitive Technologies Home Theater setup is having a blast playing this BD.    Please all you Billy Joel haters, go somewhere else with your clearly misguiding comments.  Due to some not very objective reviews, I was almost spoiled the chance to enjoy one of the very best concerts I own in terms of sound, visuals and material.
B004G600A4|5.0|Yes there are a ton of reviews for thias film, so first of all amazon should divide them among the feature film, then the DVD, and the other DVD versions that include BlueRay and 3D-DVD formats.<br /><br />Disney have made fairy tales and they way they present them in their own verison their forte, and this one's one of their crown jewels worthy of the same praise as Sleeping Beauty and The Little Mermaid. Their take on the Rapunzel story is very unique. The film gives us a wonderful prologue, completely animated, and narrated by the would be love interest of Rapunzel a thief known as Flynn Rider, who has another name, but is ashamed of it.<br /><br />Rapunzel is anything but a damsel in distress as in previous versions of the stories in both books and animated films. She is very talented, curious, clever and 18 years old. Her \\"prince\\" is actually a thief who in the end saves her from a life of imprisonment in exchange for his own, not before striking a deal with Rapunzel, getting her out the tower, making her dream come true and giving the audience a fun thrilled and happy adventure., but the film does indeed has a happy ending and both end up together.<br /><br />Like in Disney's Aladdin the jokes and gags come at the audience at tremendous speed, you barely finished laughing at something when there's another joke on your face. And it does include several songs weaved into the story, but Tangled is not really a full musical like Beauty And The Beast or The Little Mermaid. You can tell the writers did tons of reasearch of the Rapunzel story, and incorporated many elements from various versions, plus their own Disney magic. Visually being completely computer generated every single frame of the movie is nothing but stunning, a true work of art.<br /><br />The DVD single disk edition includes two different opening sequences made by the studio artists, introduced on camera by the producers and director. Sadly that is the only extra available, as Disney felt compeled to include all the extra goodies for the Blue-Ray release. There is language selection for original English, and the Spanish or French dubs, but no scene selection. The other feature is a countdown of all their 50 animated feature films set to a song.<br /><br />I give the single DVD 4 stars for lack of extras, or not including another disk like they do with so many others, and 5 stars for the movie, a new Disney classic has born! Is a must have in your Disney collection!or the Blue-Ray release. There is language selection for original English, and the Spanish or French dubs, but no scene selection.

0812973992|5.0|A rollicking, expansive, generous and kind-hearted novel.  I was never an earnest enough English student to read any Dickens that wasn't assigned, but Colum McCann's fine, fine work reminded me most of those I did enjoy.         At the top of the heap are the wonderful characters: distinctive, honest, flawed, emotional and true.  Zigging from the tightrope walker who crossed via cable 110 stories in the air between the two World Trade Center towers thirty years ago, then zagging to a humble Irish covert priest working with ladies of the street in the Bronx, he gathers a Park Avenue socialite into a group of grieving moms for their sons who lost their lives in the jungles of Vietnam War, and a half dozen others into the bountiful mix.       As Colum reveals ourselves in the mirrors of those who people the pages, he does so kindly...which is a balancing act as the acts of contrition collide with humans' baser appetites, i.e., for sex, drugs, booze, celebrity or money.  But love does win out in the end, although its mettle is tested virtually every step.      There isn't any other book I've read in the last decade, if not the last two or three, that so masterfully captures social strata with a human wink and other embellishments of folly and fondness.  And when the last page is turned, and the reader reflects on the whole, more and more facets of our errant beliefs pop up.  In the face of humble heroes and the brutally honest self-assessment of hookers (although their actions often tumble down like their drawers), after reading this slice of life in NYC, one feels oddly redeemed.         The genius touch was using the tightrope walker as the character that connects all the other stories together.  He briefly opens each section and also acts as the common thread (no pun intended) in tying the characters together.  Befitting his training, he lightly and exquisitely creates a fleeting, haunting, perilous but perfectly-in-control image against the sky.  Also, with a whisper, he foreshadows briefly the actions that seized the world's attention at the same spot three decades later.  A brilliant metaphoric lightning rod - thank goodness, although he considers what that might all mean, not a literal one.      It's not a fast read, but at the same time, not a laborious endeavor either.  I was more than willing to slow down and let the story tick along because of Colum's wonderful wordsmithing.  I wish I could read it all again for the first time.
B000056K04|5.0|If \\"Crash\\" didn't convince you of the genius of the Dave Matthews Band, well, why aren't you in a mental hospital? LOL!<br /><br />But in all seriousness, \\"Everyday\\" is perhaps the best album of 2001 (competing with Nickelback's \\"Silver Side Up\\" & Creed's \\"Weathered\\"); a tour de force of brilliantly nuanced, carefully crafted songs that have, thus far, stood the test of time. Listeners are introduced to a more \\"radio friendly\\" sound here, but I have no complaints; I actually think that DMB were best when they gravitated away from the jam band sound. Still, even at their worst, they have managed to always be better than anything by the likes of Phish, String Cheese Incident, Grateful Dead, or even Morphine & Tom Petty. DMB have evolved beautifully, and this album is proof.

B00479SVBU|4.0|I liked the ease of this product. All you have to do is drag and drop your songs onto a SD card or an USB and put the transmitter in your cigarette lighter port. I have learned where the buttons are on the remote so I can easily switch folders/songs while driving.    Downside: Doesn't play MP4's so songs from itunes won't play unless you convert them to MP3's.
B0043X7WLA|5.0|So I bought myself a pair of Sennheiser headphones and amp the other week, and while I was scouring my itunes library for some ear candy to compliment my new setup, I came across Age Of Adz.     In a library of 1000's of albums, Age Of Adz instantly stood out on my headphones. Up there with Flaming Lips' Yoshimi album or something from Of Montreal. There is no denying the layers of production here. This album is extremely textural.     Its interesting to see what Sufjan Stevens has chosen to do here, he has left behind simple melodic song writing that made Illinoise so well received and instead concentrates on the textural techniques he used to make Illinoise so orchestral and expansive. The title track is so aggressively multi-dimensional to the point I feel like Im sitting for an 'Avatar' equivalent audio extravaganza. I cant imagine how poorly channelled this would sound on a pair of ordinary 2 piece speakers. It would be the equivalent of taking your glasses off at a 3d screening.    But it is on my headphones that Ive started to really get hooked on some of these 3 dimensional layers of melody. I cant explain it, but all I can say is that it is a stark difference to the way I enjoyed the simple melodies of Illinoise.     Age of Adz is Sufjan Stevens living up this name of being an incredible composer.  - \\"Is this the future from outer space\\"
B004KSQN7C|5.0|Bow to the queen! I know she does terribly in live performances but Britney and her production team never fail to make great music. The whole album is consistent with a European dance floor theme. The Pop scene worldwide has been all conquered by European (especially Swedish) producers like Max Martin, Bloodshy & Avant and Shellback.<br /><br />Track by track review:<br />1. Till The World Ends: 8.5/10 - super catchy but sounds somewhat too generic<br />2. Hold It Against Me: 10/10 - a legendary track. the House beat is SICK.<br />3. Inside Out: 8.5/10 - great song. brit sounds a little too nasal tho.<br />4. I Wanna Go: 9.5/10 - a future hit, for sure. I love how Euro-dance-y the song is constructed.<br />5. How I Roll: 9/10 - very very original. Bloodshy Avant never fails.<br />6. (Drop Dead) Beautiful: 6/10 - my least favorite off the album.<br />7. Seal It With A Kiss: 8/10 - good but not outstanding<br />8. Big Fat Bass: 7.5/10 - it sounds good for the first minute and gets really stupid towards the end.<br />9. Trouble For Me: 7.5/10 - it's okay, nothing special<br />10. Trip To Your heart: 8.5/10 - another great track by Bloodshy&Avant, it stands out from the rest of the album. the futuristic beat reminds me of Heaven on Earth and Unusual You.<br />11. Gasoline: 8/10 - good<br />12. Criminal: 8/10 - good. the only track you can consider a ballad in FF. she sounds too nasal tho.<br /><br />Bonus track<br />13. Up n Down: 6.5/10 - it's boring<br />14. He About to Lose Me: 8/10 - it's the hidden gems :)<br />15. Selfish: 7/10 - the beat is very similar to Rihanna's \\"Rude Boy\\"<br />16. Don't Keep Me Waiting: 7.5/10 - okay<br /><br />Singles: HIAM - TTWE - HIR - IWG - IO (-BFB/TTYH/G/C/SIWAK)

B001FB4VXU|5.0|It's been ages since a sitcom has really made me laugh.  I blame the situations, which are usually lame, repetitive, and hold the characters hostage.  That's why I like this series.  Despite the \\"situation comedy\\" moniker, it's really a character comedy about characters who are, in different ways, blind to themselves.  Just like everyone from time to time.  That is, we laugh at this show because it's about us.    Not that it lacks for situations.  My favorite example is when Sheldon, ordinarily paralyzed by social awkwardness, decides to make a new friend.  But he discovers not just what he wants to know, but also truths about himself.  Truths like: having friends is tiring, taking energy from what he'd rather do.  So he makes choices.  He's not mean or heartless; he'd just rather invest his effort in areas he understands.    Every situation in this sitcom teaches us something about the characters.  Whether it's a new neighbor, a lie that gets compounded, or whatever, it always teaches us something about the characters.  Instead of binding the characters to writerly cleverness (\\"Hey, what if we trapped them in a zoo?\\"), the characters have free play to interact, discover their limitations, and learn something about themselves and their world.    I've grown unaccustomed to sitcoms showing me such respect.  It's reassuring to discover that someone out there still writes such stories, and that audiences will watch them.  Sure, few of us will ever dwell at the upper echelons of physics, or lack fundamental social skills, but we all have our passions and our lacks, and we know it.  For all its exaggerations, this show works because it's really about us.

B00006X06U|3.0|I'm a Joni fan, have been all my life it seems.  I love the haunting, melancholic sound of her voice, the heart and soul she pours into singing her songs and the words that cut through to the bone.  She is a true artist in every sense of the word.  This album is a disappointment for me.  The full orchestra depletes the feelings that always emanate from her songs and causes me to strain in order to make out the words that are overwhelmed by music that's too strong and oddly out of place for a folk singer.  I'm left with a longing that isn't fulfilled in this album.<br />My recommendations:  skip this album and spend your money on Blue or Turbulent Indigo.

Don't get me wrong, you can forget about gigging with this or for any \\"heavy\\" work, but if all you want to do is practice quietly with earphones this does the job really well.  I usually have the earphones around my neck (not on my ears) and pop the volume up... this gives me the tone I want without ear damage :)    Have not tested the ability to connect an mp3 player... i just connect earphones.    I wont repeat what the others have said, just add a bit (also because I am not an expert on the guitar, I know a lot more than many people and less than a bunch of other people), so here goes:    (Using it on a Washburn guitar with EMG pups)  Gives me good sustain  Gotta be careful plugging it in and taking it out (seems \\"plasticky\\" and might break if not careful)  **Is** plasticky and easy to break if not careful. :) (Thats why I gave it one star less)  Sit on it... forget it, you broke it. Same if you drop it by accident from a few feet.  No problems of the cover popping off (with mine) like others have complained.  Battery lasts quite a bit  Decent sound, dials work.  The dials at the bottom keep grazing stuff when I am sitting and playing and turn without me even realizing it till I paly and get a different sound - this got me a few times, keep it in mind if suddenly you lose your set tone: check the dials and reset it to the numbers you want.  It's nice not to have a chord to the guitar, easy to move around.    Overall, I'm very happy and have ordered the \\"Classic Rock\\" from Amazon as well.    Recommended, but be careful and think twice if you are a clumsy person because it's easy to break and at $40 a pop it's not cheap to replace.
0312323867|3.0|Some people you just want to choke and even a fictitious character can trigger that urge in me, and not in a good way. As this follow up to [[ASIN:0312321198 Something Borrowed]] is all about the uber obnoxious Darcy and her incessant whining, drinking while pregnant,(which made me want to blow a gasket, even though I know a small glass of wine here and there won't hurt pregnant women) bitching, moaning and in general, self centered behavior is enough to make her the most off putting character ever. It made it hard to care what happened to her because I just didn't like her and for me, as a reader, to care what happens to a character I have to at least find that character appealing in some way and I realize that she is supposed to have undergone a giant character transformation but, by the end if you don't like her, does it matter?
B0000AUHPG|5.0|There are so many reviews on this movie;there is little left for one to say.It is ,without doubt,one of the best Westerns ever made and deserves to be called a classic.Everything from the actors,the scenery,the music,the storyline,etc., is top notch.Then there is the bonus of a second Disc with Commentary,exclusive interviews,history,and other information about the film and actors that add greatly to understanding what the intent of the movie was all about,and is equally enjoyable and makes this package even greater than attending just the the movie in a theatre.<br />I grew up in the 40's and 50's when Western movies were much more numerous but there is no comparison to the fewer ,but supremely better produced Westerns of later years.This movie was made in 1969 is an example of the great Westerns made these days,albiet we get only a couple a year.

B0009P5YXO|2.0|I bought this after I had already purchased the 11th Doctor's Sonic Screelwdriver.  This was is substantially lacking in quality construction.  There is a plastic piece used to slide the screwdriver into an extended position, that will fall off without much force at all.  The whole of the toy isn't even good plastic.  I recommend this as a child's toy who is not yet a Whovian.  When a prop quality version is mass produced I'll be certain to mention it here.
B004XDYJRU|2.0|I used this app to listen to talk radio like stored Clark Howard shows, of which usually 10 or so shows are available. The problem is that after 10 or 15 minutes, it drops the data stream and I have to start over. Since there is no fast forward function, this is incredibly annoying.  I stopped using the program for this reason.
B004LZRSBY|5.0|A-ha's final concert in Oslo is beautifully shot and sounds amazing. The band never sounded better and Morten's voice is just beautiful, he absolutely sounds amazing on this! I am so sad the band is coming to an end... it seems to early! Their albums in the 00's-10's were their best and what a shame the US only knows Take On Me!<br />Get this! It plays perfectly on U.S. blu-ray players ::))
B002VPE1YS|5.0|This is a great product! My Droid 2 fits perfectly in it! I use it to protect my phone in my purse. I also like the clip on it because it makes my phone easy to find in my purse. It is a great price too!
B004L79VUI|3.0|I like Robbie's solo albums and this one has some great songs on it.  It's a little short, but it is very enjoyable to listen to.  It's not his best, but it's still a good effort.  I like the collaborations and love hearing Clapton's guitar (it sounds similar to his playing on Unplugged).
B001UV4XHY|3.0|I loved the movie when I saw it at the cinema, but this DVD was a real disappointment. The video quality is very poor - everything is very dark and green-tinged. The backgrounds (?? where there were green screens) are also pixellated and these pixellations move about distractingly. I will be writing to WB to get a replacement on the basis that Amazon must have received a bad batch. I thought it was a bit of a cheek to call three deleted scenes 'Features' as well.
B004NSULHM|5.0|I just picked up The King of Limbs earlier today. I do consider myself a fairly big Radiohead fan, owning all of their albums to date and listening to each one consistently. Since I got this album, it's been on repeat for the past two hours now. Many argue that this is more or less the same sound they've created with In Rainbows, I agree in part. The difference here is that this album is much more abstract, with very chilling and sometimes dark undertones, which I'm personally a fan of; as opposed to In Rainbows which tends to have more of an upbeat sound and be less heavy. Also when considering to buy this album, I was skeptical of the minimal amounts of tracks on it, 8 hardly seems enough to be deemed an album. And yet, it seems to fit perfectly and doesn't seem too short or too drawn out. The stand out tracks for me are \\"Morning Mr. Magpie\\", \\"Codex\\", and \\"Give Up The Ghost\\". Anyone who is a fan of Radiohead should definitely check this album out, plus the price tag is hard to pass up. Nine dollars is an extremely fair priced album. But like I stated earlier, this is definitely a more abstract and somber album- so if you weren't a huge fan of the slower songs from in Rainbows (i.e. \\"House Of Cards\\") You may want to skip out on this one. Definitely worth a listen, or twelve, though!
B004SEVPWQ|4.0|honestly people, who gives a hoot about the EULA? just click okay and enjoy the game like 99 percent of the rest of us. great game too! i'd give it 5 stars if the controls were either more intuitive or at least better documented.

B00009V7PJ|5.0|Cher's DVD of \\"The Farewell Tour\\" was excellent. I recently purchased this through Amazon.  Amazon never fails to deliver right on time with outstanding quality products.    If you want to be entertained,.. buy this DVD.  The Girl has it all....She sings, dances,..she's funny,.. and has great stage presence.  She is beautiful on stage,.. classy clothes, showy and she really entertains the audience in this video. She has many costume changes and wears them all like a showgirl.  She outshines all the new age singers, and when she puts on a show,.. you will be entertained.    Cher has been a Super Star for many years now,.. both in Concert shows, and as an Academy Award  winning actress in movies. While you are in Amazon,.. check out some great movies that she has has starred in.  She just keeps on going and never disappoints. Cher,.. Don't ever stop.  I hope this is one of many more of her \\"Farewell Tours\\".  JUST GREAT. WE LOVE HER.
B001ESYAJY|5.0|I didn't care much for the theme song from \\"Casino Royale\\"  But I VERY much like the one from this film.  THis soundtrack is divine!  Splendid.  If you're pissed & driving:  this is it!  You'll drive very fast while listening to this in your car stereo.
B002TLSSXO|5.0|These are just what I was looking for.  Got rid of all my old utensils.  I have been giving these as gifts now and everyone loves them and makes a point of commenting to me after they use them.
B004I4H8PO|2.0|I would like to get my hands on the 'orrible, 'orrible lit-tle man who thought up the packaging for this album. Two of the CDs were scratched on receipt because of the way they were stuffed in the cardboard pockets in the set. i managed to clean them up by performing a CD wash using eye glasses cleaner but that's not the point. The packaging sucks. Recommendation; if you buy this set, go out and purchase 5 CD sleeves to store them. Other than that a great set. However, where is the \\"video\\" which is advertised. My DVD has only audio. Whoever kaboshed the design of such a monumental set should be fired. I gave it 2 stars because such great music can oversome even the odds presented here.
B004SKJIEC|2.0|Many people will look for the gold copy of an album to offer superior playback - it would be a given you would think. This is one of my all time favorite recordings. It has been butchered and sent back a notch by Audio Fidelity. Not sure what went wrong here - I compared several cuts back to back - The AF Gold and the latest Tamla remaster from Universal/ Motown  on two players, Sony SCD 555 and Ah Njoe Tjoeb 4000. The dynamics are gone, the detail is down, the recording is veiled. To smooth a recording is acceptable - until you loose the dynamics.<br />What a bring down. I would like to send it back..
B004EC5IUW|5.0|really kicks into high gear with this movie. I remember the original stuff, both its pros and cons. Ordinarily I don't care for retellings, but the changes they made to the story make it fresh, and the artwork and action enjoyable. Definitely going to buy the next one that comes out.
B003YBUSMW|5.0|This is a finely constructed racing wheel. I purchased this wheel for use with Nascar 2011 and had tons of fun using it. However, there is a problem with it. It is impossible to make the turns without hitting the wall on short tracks like Dover. As I said it is a quality wheel. It may work for you on other games but considering all the short tracks in Nascar 2011, you're better off with the paddle.
0545265355|5.0|I really liked that it is hardback covers and you get the complete set for a really great price.  Loved the product and the fact it arrived quickly.
B0034G4OUO|3.0|This movie is very similar to Kill Bill in its plot.  Nothing that impressive or new here, but it's entertaining enough to get through.  You'll get some shoot-out scenes, killings, and car chases.
B004IFYMWK|5.0|I was put off by the lukewarm reviews when this was in theaters, but I'm glad I finally saw it. When you can't wait for the next scene even though you already know what happened, that's great storytelling. Watts and Penn were excellent, and I loved the supporting cast, too.
B004SEVPWQ|5.0|Thanks to Amazon, I didn't have to pay $2.99 for this excellent game! Had I known this game was so much fun, I would have purchased it.
B004Q1FDHO|5.0|when I downloaded this app I thought I wasn't going to like it. boy was I wrong! the graphics aren't the best but I don't think that's the point of the game. the controls could be better but for the most part it gets the job done. I love this and I think I might get addicited to this game
B004Q1FDHO|1.0|Horrible memory management. Its an absolute RAM hog.  Crashed my phone. Had to yank the battery to reboot. Samsung epic.
0553386794|5.0|When first I read this I was in awe of the plot. I could not believe that certain events would play out the way they did -- killing off favorites and villains alike! The characters are so well written, and it's easy to relate to your favorite (my husband and I differ as to who THE favorite is, but alas, who agrees 100% with their spouse?) This is one epic novel that, while lengthy, does not drag. I credit the changing POV (point of view) for that. Each chapter is written from the perspective of various characters, which really inveigles you into the plot and makes you want to beg for a just a detail or two more... and you can't skip to the next part in that POV because many of details are covered in other people's portions of the narrative. This book is out of my normal niche genre, but I recommend it highly. It it utterly captivating -- I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />(PS anyone else hoping that a certain northerner is successful?)
B0041KKYEM|4.0|Natalie Portman gives the performance of her life as Nina, the talented yet neurotic ballerina teetering close to the edge. In a way, this role is brilliant casting. Nina's vulnerability and chastity mirrors Portman's own public persona to some degree. She has adamantly refused to do nudity and sex scenes in the past. Even in her amazing turn in 'Closer' as a troubled stripper, she was never nude and there was still a pure, childlike quality about her that made you want to protect and nurture her.     In this film, that girlishness is intensified through the character of Nina, only to be destroyed by the end of the film through Nina's exploration of her sexuality and her dark side. Like Nina, Portman is required to 'lose herself' in a way that she never attempted before and the result is spellbinding. Her Academy Award was well deserved.    Mila Kunis also turns in a very solid performance. Her character is less demanding, acting wise, than Nina but I would disagree with other reviewers who claimed Lily lacked depth. It's just that there's an inscrutable quality to her. It's difficult to figure out if she's good-natured and friendly or a shrewd manipulator (which is the point). Kunis projected this ambiguity with great skill and this is certainly her best role to date.     Darren Aronofsky is known for creating visceral, startlingly intense films. This kind of intensity tends to provoke equally intense reactions in the viewers. Therefore, 'Black Swan' is a type of film that inspires few middle ground opinions; the majority of people will either love or hate it. Even though I happen to love this movie, I understand that there's equal ammo for both camps. Those who love it will be seduced by its dark, psychological undertow and those who hate it will shirk from its brash, head-turning quality of Aronofsky's direction. Either way, 'Black Swan' is not just a film, it's an experience.
1593553307|5.0|I purchased this item to replace a library copy who's last disc was cracked so I was libel for it.  Lucky for me the seller was very prompt about getting me the item so I had it before the due date of my libary copy and it was in great condition.
B004FGMV0W|4.0|Lavigne's new album is a risky breath of fresh air in the saga which is the clash between fans of her old and new phases of music. Goodbye Lullaby acts as the seal on her old albums and the harbinger of the new. Having travelled the well-worn path of musical accommodation, Lavigne has been lauded and downtrodden by fans both eager for a punk-rock princess and a rebellious tom-boy. Lavigne's studied changes throughout her career have encompassed both of these personas, as she is paradoxically forced to conform to the trick of keeping fresh and new in order to cause ripples and be individual.<br /><br /> This album has all the hallmarks of a future legend as Lavigne's finally managed to combine her two warring worlds into one shot of fist-pumping choruses and tear-jerking ballads. With substance to please both old and new fans at once, Avril's certainly risen to the unspoken challenge of creating a new identity - a new set of schemas - and a new tone. Having finally written the final chapter of both her old personas (and styles) Avril has now propped open the door to the possibility of reinventing herself from scratch, without taking heed to her old self, as she has achieved a certain kind of closure on it for her fans.<br /><br /> Overall, the album is immensely enjoyable for the both the casual listener and Little Black Star (the unofficial name of Avril's fans), as it includes both catchy dance tracks and more meaningful ballads. The songs are easy to relate to, and her voice has matured and grown more pure since her previous albums.
1400052181|3.0|This book reinforced my long-held philosophy that I should never give up on a book too early.  Until about the last quarter of the book I was going to rate it two stars, because I found it very tedious even though the subject matter was interesting.  But, about that time the author started describing in depth her personal relationship and interactions with Henrietta Lacks's family members, and it really started to pick up steam and pull some things together.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong; the \\"science\\" in the book is fascinating and is, of course, the reason for the book.  I started reading it with no knowledge that there even was such a thing as HeLa cells, that have been alive for 50 years, being bought, sold, traded, given away, researched and contaminating other cell cultures the world over all that time.  I am grateful for this glimpse into an aspect of medical research and science that I never knew existed.<br /><br />For some reason, though, the early flow of the book just didn't grab me; maybe it's the way it went back and forth from present to past to \\"middle past,\\" switching from personal stories to medical research.  I kept feeling like I was missing something, or had forgotten something, or had lost my place and had to figure out where to pick up the thread again.  The whole thing seemed repetitious at times, while at other times the author seemed to jump into different areas with little background information.  Maybe it's just me; it's obvious she did her research, but at times I just didn't feel like it was pulled together very well.  Overall, the book just seemed longer than it needed to be.<br /><br />Nevertheless, in the end this was well worth the read, even leading me to do a bit of follow-up research on my own on certain aspects of the medical science, as well as Henrietta and her family, that piqued my interest while reading the book.<br /><br />There are books I have given up on completely; I'm happy this was not one of them.
B004HO6HWA|3.0|This remake from the Mechanic in 1970 has peaks an lows. The script has many loose ends (specially for the newcomer who is not familiarized with the original one). simon West his director bet for the hackneyed formula (chase, violence and explosions) but seen from a flat level, without worrying too much about the meaning of this character as product of the cold war when the C.I.A and K.G.B. domained and controlled part of the game.<br /><br />On the other hand, Stratham hasn't the cold sight of Bronson and Ben Foster is not Jan -Michael Vincent too. The film has certain innovative twists but the end is far away from the original impact of the first one.<br /><br />Nevertheless, it would seem there will be a sequel for the next season.
B004EC5IV6|5.0|I pre-ordered this almost a full month before it came out. It showed up only days after its release date I was very pleased.<br />Now for the anime itself, there wasn't much that I didn't love!The music, the animation, amazing. Eva 2.22 is nothing short of fantastic, definititely something every anime and Eva fan needs in their collection.
B001152TL6|5.0|Perhaps with the only exception of David Cronenberg and Chris Nolan in U.S.A., Roman Polanski and Peter Greenaway overseas, no other director like David Lynch has known to deal with the sequential breakthrough of the natural flow and the employment of the narrative elipsis, conveying the spectator into a twisted labyrinth of images, sounds and normal codes of the semiotic of the cinematographic language, this time he returned to the big screen with this cryptic thriller about confused identities and erotic obsession. Fred (Bill Pullman) is an avant-garde jazz saxophonist who shares a luxurious but fashionably barren house with his wife Renee (Patricia Arquette). Fred suspects that Renee may be unfaithful to him, but realizes he has bigger things to worry about when a series of videotapes appear at his door that prove someone is watching his home from the outside and inside. When Renee is found murdered, Fred finds himself behind bars, but one morning Fred is no longer in his cell. He has seemingly been transformed into Pete Drayton (Balthazar Getty), a young auto mechanic who foolishly allowed himself to get involved with the wife of gangster Dick Laurent (Robert Loggia), a luscious blonde named Alice who looks exactly like Renee.<br /><br />This gradual metamorphoses has a common departure point: the febrile obsession of unfaithfulness, fear, anguish and existential desperation so typical of the Post War years. You may realize how Renee and Alice Wakefield repeat similar dialogues.<br /><br />I would like invite you my dear readers to watch Zentropa of Lars von Triers in which the hypnotic initial sequence of the highway seen from the driver's perspectve is just the same than the rails of a train in movement, and how Lynch as von Triers proceed to translate the viewer into a dreamlike state.<br /><br />Overlooked by the great audiences, this film will captivate and engage you, only if you accept Lynch's rules of game; otherwise you will leave the hall with an acidic flavour.<br /><br />A sumptuous masterpiece all the way through.sterpiece all the way through.
B0025UHKNS|1.0|THere are detailed reviews here already. I'm strictly here to tell you I am a GPS and gadget fan and have had the 305 for 6 years and it has 5x the battery life during use and 30x standby battery life. It is far easier to see what you're looking for.  This bezel is a dud. Touch it by accident during a run and you might stop and start dozens of times- pretty frustrating. If they were going for Apple- like design and functionality, well this is a complete failure.  Buy the 305 and forget the fact that it's bulkier- it also is way easier to read while running and biking and walking, which is kind of the point, eh?
B001UV4XI8|2.0|This review is for my mom, whom and three others she works with, who purchased the movie on blu-ray. Some part into the movie, it stops and skips in the same place. Her co-workers reported this too. Skipping and stopping in the same place in the film. My mom had to eject the disc and and put it back in the blu-ray player for it to work again.
B001D52XO2|5.0|This is a fabulous collection of Nina's work. It spans live and studio recordings, old (starting with 1957) as well as more recent (1993), from across all the record labels she recorded for. It's curated by the head of Nina Simone's British fanclub rather than some record company executive; a person with good knowledge of her work.      I have just about every CD she issued but this is the one I keep playing. Highly recommended.
B004Q1FDHO|3.0|The game is fun and addicting.  However it seems to force close way to often.  I would gladly pay for a perfected version. At least this was free today!
1741048303|4.0|I used this on a 5 week trip through 4 islands of Indonesia, about a year after this was released. While the transportation costs seemed to be accurate, the guesthouse (cheaper end) and food was not. For example, it might say a single is 80,000rph when in fact it was 120. And I was in about as low season as you can go. This extra 50% was very common. Therefore, my budget was nowhere what I needed. I'm not saying I wouldn't have gone, but Indo is NOT one of the cheapy destinations that you think it should be. Also, if you are vegetarian be prepared for a LOT of the same flavor over and over. Still there are some amazing things to see.
B00000IHC7|5.0|Well, folks, you know that anything by Rory is going to be worth listening to, but if you are anything like me, you play the CDs to death for a year and then file them under \\"indispensable\\". What happened here is that my daughter, having seen Fall Out Boy recently, grubbed about in the cars and the cupboards to see what was about from Dad's prehistoric era and came up with Top Priority. Fall Out Boy, with the relentless thrash and monochord banging, failed to ignite the senses, so to speak, although they improve all the time. They also left me deaf and numb from the ridiculous volume they played at - made Cream seem like Freddie and the Dreamers (RIP, Freddie)and The Jeff Beck Band like Herman's Hermits.     I had forgotten just how accomplished this little-promoted collection is. My band used to perform Follow Me, and it's a great powerful surge to the record, with some quite extraordinary guitar pyrotechnics from Rory. It's actually got a very good tune, too, and it's fun to see Gerry McAvoy singing harmonies on the chorus on the Live At Cork video - with Rory and Gerry cracking up when they get the sequence wrong! Philby continues Rory's fascination with spies, molls and the underworld and then the whole album continues with a collection of Rory's usual interests, all performed well, thoughtfully and with control.     I gather that the collection was recorded in a very short time and occasionally the production values are not perfect. What is nearly perfect is the playing. Rory is on fire, and, as always, his faithful band is exemplary. This CD is a timely reminder of just how exceptional Rory and his bands were, and the new wave of punk thrashers would do very well to listen to his control, dynamics, words and, it has to be said, incredible ability. They won't, of course, and will continue to deafen and batter their teeny audiences into submission which is a great shame.    I saw Rory over 35 times live, right back to Woburn Abbey in 1968. I also got to know hima little and he was a gentleman and a very decent person, as well as being an exemplary musician. He was a top guitarist in 4 tunings and a superb slide player, also excellent on mandolin, harmonica and alto saxophone. At the Rory Gallagher Festival in Ballyshannon a couple of years back, when The Eric Bell Band (Eric formed Thin Lizzy and was a great friend of Rory) was headlining with my drummer and best friend Andy Golden, all the tribute bands and Roryophiles were playing \\"Bad Penny.\\" At a blues night in Bournemouth a few month back, the jammers were playing it too. These songs are good and people like and remember them.    This is a lovely CD, full of great playing, songwriting and powerful and reliable support from Ted McKenna and the ever-excellent Gerry McAvoy.    Just go and buy it. I have been trying to promote Rory for the last 43 years and I will never bore of doing so - but it is becoming tiring!     A lovely CD. Not a duff moment, really. Just a lesson in how it's done and how it's not done.
0762434279|5.0|came as advertised, but i failed to read the \\"miniature\\" part. i wanted a full size book, but that was my fault for not reading close enough.
B002WY65VU|5.0|I love this movie. If you need a movie that is pure fun, enjoyable, funny and just great, this is the movie for you. This movie should be rated A+ on a zombie movie scale. I am under 18  and this is one of  my favorite movies of all time. Watch this movie!
B0024FAR5M|1.0|I want to like it. I really do. But it's SO awful. Charlie Hunam was great in Undeclared. Ron Pearlman was great as Hellboy. Both of them are awful here. The writing is absurd. There's no balance or subtlety to any of it. Every character, both good and bad is one-dimensional. It's just a complete mess. It's a daytime soap disguised as a show about outlaw bikers. The Wire and the Sopranos have set the bar and this show is about 100 miles south. Just inexcusably awful.
888370536X|3.0|I accidentally bought this notebook instead of buying it's big brother. Fortunately, it's way more convenient to carry around than the bigger version would have been. That being said, the notebook is quite small. It's great for jotting down little notes.. I use it to write down vocal exercises that I learn. Little stuff like that. If you're actually wanting to write out more than a couple measures of music, don't get this book. Honestly, I wouldn't consider one of the Moleskine notebooks if you're going to write some serious music. If you're using it to jot down ideas in more of a journalistic form, these notebooks are great.<br /><br />All in all, this particular notebook is small and convenient, but doesn't lend itself to being useful in the realm of writing music.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|Love it. The agenda view does a good job of packing a lot of info in an organized way. Well done.
0756404738|4.0|Patrick Rothfuss' The Name of the Wind was released with much fanfare in 2007. Indeed, this debut enjoyed both commercial and critical success. The Name of the Wind became the bestselling fantasy debut in hardcover format of all time, beating both Terry Goodkind's Wizard's First Rule and George R. R. Martin's A Game of Thrones. The novel won the Quill Award and cracked the top 10 of the New York Times Bestsellers list in paperback. All in all, it was everything any author could ever hope for.    Based on the fact that the first draft of the entire trilogy had already been written, readers expected The Wise Man's Fear to be released the following year. Based on Rothfuss' answer in his first interview, his growing legions of fans were persuaded that the entire trilogy would be out by 2009:    Well.... I've already written them. So you won't have to wait forever for them to come out. They'll be released on a regular schedule. One per year.    You can also expect the second book to be written with the same degree of care and detail as this first one. You know the sophomore slump? When a writer's second novel is weaker because they're suddenly forced to write under deadline? I don't have to worry about that because my next two novels are already good to go.    Unfortunately, as many authors will tell you, life got in the way, forcing Patrick Rothfuss and his publishers to push back the release date of The Wise Man's Fear time and again. Following several postponements, Daw Books officially announced that the book would be released in early 2011. But as was the case with Martin's A Feast for Crows, the intervening years have raised readers' expectations to an incredibly high level. And the question was: Would The Wise Man's Fear be worth the wait?    So was it, in the end, worth the four years it took to be published? Let me set your mind at ease. For those who enjoyed The Name of the Wind, you can safely go ahead and pre-order The Wise Man's Fear. It's everything its predecessor was, and then some! However, if you weren't thrilled by Rothfuss' debut, then I believe you need not bother with the second volume. Style-wise and plot-wise, regardless of the fact that the storylines are a bit more ambitious, there is likely nothing that can win over readers who were not that impressed with The Name of the Wind. In terms of style and tone, both novels are pretty similar. So I doubt that The Wise Man's Fear can satisfy readers that weren't enchanted by the first one. But for fans of the author, buckle up! It should definitely scratch that itch!    Here's the blurb:    In The Wise Man's Fear, Day Two of The Kingkiller Chronicle, Kvothe searches for answers, attempting to uncover the truth about the mysterious Amyr, the Chandrian, and the death of his parents. Along the way, Kvothe is put on trial by the legendary Adem mercenaries, forced to reclaim the honor of his family, and travels into the Fae realm. There he meets Felurian, the faerie woman no man can resist, and who no man has ever survived...until Kvothe.    In The Wise Man's Fear, Kvothe takes his first steps on the path of the hero and learns how difficult life can be when a man becomes a legend in his own time.    The structure of the book is the same as that of The Name of the Wind. The better part of the novel recounts Kvothe's past and is told in the first person. The interludes, on the other hand, occur in \\"real time\\" and employ a third person narrative. I recall finding that specific structure a bit odd in Rothfuss' debut, but it works well in The Wise Man's Fear. It feels as though there are more interludes in this one, but I could be mistaken. While it's evident that many of these interludes will pave the way for the second trilogy to come, at times they felt a bit redundant and unnecessary. Especially since many of them break the momentum of the narrative, just as things are getting really interesting. Like unwanted commercial when you're watching a particularly good movieon TV. . .    Before going further, I also wanted to address something that's been appearing on many message boards on the internet. Patrick Rothfuss has often claimed that The Wise Man's Fear would feature more sex and violence than what his fans have been accustomed to in the past, and many readers have been wondering if they would find that offputting. In retrospect, it all depends on what sort of speculative fiction works you usually enjoy. If, à la Brandon Sanderson, you can't abide swearing and the depiction (in any shape of form) of sexuality, then perhaps you might find certain scenes offputting. There is nothing graphic, degrading, or low-brow about those sequences, mind you. Sex is part of life, and thus it is also part of this tale. Regarding the violence, there's very little of it. Nothing to write home about, to tell the truth. All in all, if you are a fan of authors such as George R. R. Martin, R. Scott Bakker, Joe Abercrombie, and Richard Morgan, what sex and violence you'll find within the pages of this book barely warrant a PG-13 label.    It's also been said that a more sexually active Kvothe was sort of a wish fulfillment thing on Rothfuss' part. It's been compared to that of Guy Gavriel Kay with bearded characters. Keeping that in mind as I read along, I would have to agree on this. For a redhead male, Kvothe sure gets an inordinate amount of action in The Wise Man's Fear. And if you had trouble believing that Archie could have both Betty and Veronica, you may raise an eyebrow on more than one occasion in this second volume. Having said that, it's simply something that will make you smirk from time to time, and it doesn't take anything away from the reading experience.    In terms of worldbuilding, the cover blurb hinted at a lot more in The Wise Man's Fear, so my curiosity was piqued. Rothfuss played his cards rather close to his chest in The Name of the Wind, and I was hoping to learn more about the world and its societies in this one. Sadly,yet again, the author offers us a few glimpses of the depth of his creation, yet he appears to be always holding back. Granted, Rothfuss elaborates on a lot more in this novel, which never fails to get the reader to hope for even more. That's good, no question, but Rothfuss rarely follows through with more revelations. To a certain extent, that was at times a disappointment, especially given the length of this book. I would have thought that the tale would have expanded a lot more in scope and vision, yet always you get the feeling that Patrick Rothfuss is holding himself back.    Oddly enough, what is perhaps the book's most impressive aspect could also be its biggest shortcoming. Rothfuss has an amazing eye for details. His fluid prose and evocative narrative make the story come alive, creating an imagery that never fails to dazzle. And yet, it could be that Rothfuss is too in love with his creation and spends an excessive amount of time describing the minutiae of Kvothe's mundane life instead of focusing on the greater scheme of things. As I mentioned, Rothfuss does it exceedingly well, and it makes the story leap off the page. But overdone, it's simply overkill.    Which then leads to pacing issues, precluding the story from progressing in a meaningful way in several portions of the novel. The Wise Man's Fear starts slow. How slow? Slow enough for Patrick Rothfuss to make Tad Williams look like Mike Tyson. And it's mainly due to the fact that the author spends about 400+ pages re-establishing facts from The Name of the Wind. Yes, Kvothe is poor. Yes, he has to play music to make ends meet. Yes, he has problems paying his tuition fees and must borrow money from dubious sources. Yes, he is a smartass. Yes, the Masters hate him. Yes, he's kind of a dumbass with women, especially Denna. Yes, there is trouble brewing between him and Ambrose. Nothing new under the sun. . . We're talking about a character who will kill a king and experience all sort of wonders. He'll go through harrowing ordeals and become one of the most notorious hero/villain the world has ever seen. So do I want to read another chapter featuring Kvothe crafting more sympathy lamps to help pay for tuition? Simply put: no.    Not that there is no meaningfull or important stuff within those chapters. Far from it. But I feel that a 3-page \\"What has gone before\\" section would have allowed Rothfuss to concentrate on those specific plotlines and probably save himself about 300+ pages of things we already knew. In addition, rehashing all that material means that there is very little sense of escalation, very little tension. In a sense, The Wise Man's Fear doesn't truly kick in until we are done with the University part. That's when the story kicks into high gear and where Patrick Rothfuss truly shines. Only then do we really realize that The Name of the Wind was no fluke. At that point, the tale that would make Kvothe the man he'll become begins in earnest.    I will not spoil the tale by unveiling anything that the blurb hasn't already revealed. But I really enjoyed how Kvothe's unending search for the Chandrian will bring him to attempt to uncover the secrets of the mysterious order of the Amyr. The time spent both with the Adem mercenaries and in the faerie world were also quite engrossing, if a bit overdone. Kvothe's time with Felurian is probably the most flagrant example. Yet that's just nitpicking, in the end. The last two thirds of The Wise Man's Fear are extremely good. They give us an idea of the breadth of the author's talent and imagination, hinting at a lot more to come.    My main complaint would have to be that for a work of its size, given its length The Wise Man's Fear doesn't move the story significantly forward the way George R. R. Martin's A Storm of Swords, Steven Erikson's Memories of Ice, and Robert Jordan's The Shadow Rising did with their own series. Could be that volume three will be for all the marbles. We'll have to wait and see. It might be that Rothfuss attention to details and certain would-be extraneous plotlines will pay unanticipated dividends in the final installment of the trilogy. Time will tell. . . But at face value, it looks as though, like its predecessor, The Wise Man's Fear is decidedly overlong.    Once more, this second volume is a character-driven book. As a first person narrative, it can't be anything but that. There is some character growth where Kvothe is concerned, yet less than I expected. Still, I figure that what he goes through in the last portion of the novel will help shape him into the figure he is destined to become. The supporting cast, though bigger than that in The Name of the Wind, is composed of a relatively small number of protagonists. Unfortunately, Denna remains as annoying as ever, and if they keep it up she and Kvothe will soon dethrone Perrin and Faile as the most exasperating couple (or pseudo couple) in fantasy.    In the end, if you liked The Name of the Wind, you will love The Wise Man's Fear. Indeed, although both books suffer from the same shortcomings, Patrick Rothfuss managed to take it up a few notches in this one. Hence, you are less likely to find the pacing issues and my nitpicking offputting in any significant manner. For those who had problems with Rothfuss' debut, however, this one might not be for you.    The Wise Man's Fear is a solid and accessible fantasy work. Whether or not it lives up to the high expectations the many delays engendered remains to be seen. But based on his loyal and enthusiastic fanbase, I'm pretty confident it will! Now let's just hope that it won't take four years for Patrick Rothfuss to complete the final chapter in this quality series.

B004SQS9FA|1.0|I loved In Rainbows, Kid A, Amnesiac, and Hail To The Thief, but I just couldn't get into this album. Granted, I've only listened through it once, but I really don't want to listen to it again. I guess, for me, it sounds a little too much like noise and the vocals, when they're present, sound too jumbled to make out. I know part of it is just the way it's 'supposed' to sound, but I don't like it. Perhaps it'll grow on me someday, but not today.
B000002J1U|5.0|Since I Been Loving You is probably one of Zeps best songs. Amazing live as we Zep fans have seen on DVD etc. A true classic timeless album. This album reflected what a truly talented group Led Zeppelin was to the core. Their ballads are something to be cherished for sure.
B0043X7WLA|3.0|I like five songs on here out of the 11 it has. The ones I liked were \\"Futile Devices,\\" \\"Too Much,\\" \\"I Walked,\\" \\"Vesuvius,\\" and various parts of \\"Impossible Soul.\\" Futile Devices might be my favorite because it has a simple sound, or at least I think it does. The ones not listed I didn't like either because it was too repetitive or sounded like noise, which makes \\"Too Much\\" and \\"Impossible Soul\\" an exception because they have repetitive lyrics and some parts that might sound like noise, but its saving grace is the fact that it hypnotizes me; it sounds cool! Ultimately, this leads me to think that the rest of this album has a very good chance of growing on me. Good day.

B004OKFISQ|5.0|To address the issues brought up in another review, this album is the best example I've heard of this classic album on vinyl, bar none.   I know of a few people who's copy is clicky, but my copy is dead quiet.  Not much more needs to be said about the defining work.  Suffice it to say, if you've always liked this record but wondered if there was more buried in the grooves, there is, at least on this version.  More bass, more drums, more guitar -- all more clearly defined without sacrificing warmth.  Steve Hoffman and Kevin Gray didn't tweak an EQ or adjust a level here and there.  They pulled music from the analog master that is more transparent and inviting than any previous vinyl edition.  They've set this up to be the GREAT guitar, bass and drums album it always could be.  Crisp with good, clear bottom end.  The piano is no longer obscured by the layered guitars and vocals.  Each now resides securely in it's own space.  And the guitars have new open dynamics like never before.      Now, some slight criticisms would be that they didn't faithfully reproduce the cover and insert exact to the original with textured and matte cardstock.      But that's small potatoes when you listen....

B002ZG9774|3.0|Ok so we have a formula.. think back a few years to Coyote Ugly, change the setting and voila!  The acting is so-so, the songs are good and Cher..well she's just plain scary. At one stage I had to do a double-take as I thought she was wearing a Michael Myers hockey mask..but no..it was her face! Xtina has the voice, but it was a laugh when they \\"changed\\" from miming cd's to well..Xtina miming her songs lol.  If you have a few hours to kill and a good surround with a decent sub crank it, if not I'd give it a pass.  Also I found it funny that Xtina's own stage show outfits were raunchier than anything she wore in Burlesque and NO nudity to speak of.  definition of Burlesque : Also, bur·lesk . a humorous and provocative stage show featuring slapstick humor, comic skits, bawdy songs, striptease acts, and a scantily clad female chorus (wish someone had read that when penning the script - more like hoochie koochie imho).
0756404738|4.0|I am a fan of the first book. Over the time it took for the second to emerge I reread it at least three times, but I cannot stomach the thought of waiting another three to five years to find out what will happen next. I could live Kvothe's life in that time.  Writing is not hard, you just plod along and hammer out what you want to give to your readers, refine it to match the ending that already lies within your own head, then make any refinements' or changes as the editor or publishers see fit.  Writers write. That's what's what they do. If they can't or if it takes a hard grueling time to write then they shouldn't be doing it. Life doesn't get in the way. If they are a true writer than it is their life to write. They are paid a lot of money to do what they do. So in order to make more they should get to it.   It's like Christopher Paolini who thought it would be cool to become rich and make Eragon a movie, only to have it blow up in his face and make his readers that much more weary of his own intentions. Then a three book series becomes a four, and takes another three years to bring to press.   Making people wait will dull their attentions in this fast moving world, and great writers will fall at the wayside with all the great stories in the world, but no one willing to wait to hear them.
B004N62KTG|1.0|I wasn't expecting much from this song. I don't listen to Lady Gaga and I think her music lacks anything substantial whatsoever, but if I'm at the clubs and the mood is right when a Gaga song is on, I can enjoy it.<br /><br />But this? Ugh.<br /><br />People have made note of the similarities to Madonna's \\"Express Yourself\\" and while I do agree, call me crazy if you want but I'd prefer to call this a more synth heavy \\"Vogue\\". Even the intro sounds eerily similar. Either way, this song should be called \\"Express Yourself Through a Vogue\\" because it's a blatant ripoff of both tracks. And while I am not a big fan Madonna either, at least her songs have substance of some sort.<br /><br />I'll admit I applaud her for being daring, but sometimes daring is not enough. Madonna was daring and her music is something more than catchy. But this song is disgustingly corny beyond belief. For one, I applaud the pro-LGBT message- I am not gay but I have family and friends who are gay, but it's been done before to death. I know gay people who roll their eyes at this song because they've heard it several years ago.<br /><br />But looking past the LGBT message is just a terrible song with no substance or purpose but to just be another song having people filling Gaga's wallet.<br /><br />I wonder if Lady Gaga will be riding Guy Ritchie's disco stick sometime and writing kids' books in the future sometime. Oh well, at least we can all look at the picture of her with Nicko McBrain as her one crowning moment of awesome.

B004LWZVZC|2.0|The trial of Abraham Lincoln's killers has never received all that much attention. More focus is on the assassination itself, the path of the bullet, the funeral train and the tear-filled burial in Springfield. But the trial, coming as it did at a time of national grief and paranoia, had strong echoes of our current political climate, which is undoubtedly why Robert Redford decided to film it. But Redford's fast and loose approach to the facts of the case made it clear that his focus was more on filming a parable than in depicting history.<br /><br />The film starts in the middle, with Redford sketching a 15-minute synopsis of the events of the assassination night. Aside from Lincoln, 2 other high government officials were targeted by conspirators led by John Wilkes Booth. Veep Andrew Johnson's attacker got cold feet and didn't act. Secretary of State Seward's face was viciously slashed in a knife attack, but his life was saved by a metal neck brace he wore on account of a recent carriage accident. Lincoln was shot in the back of the head while watching a play. Very quickly, the residents and visitors to Mary Surratt's DC boarding house (where Booth and the other conspirators hung out) were rounded up and imprisoned in connection with the crimes.<br /><br />The rest of the film revolved around the case of Mary Surratt -- finding her an attorney, the details of the trial and the execution of the condemned.<br /><br />I have to admit that when I first saw the film, I was excited about the lengths that Redford had gone to show us Washington as it might have appeared in 1865, with its dirt streets, horse traffic and oil illumination. James McAvoy did a creditable job portraying the youthful defense attorney Frederick Aiken. Kevin Klein played Secretary of War Edward Stanton with steel and conviction. Robin Wright was noble and mournful as Mary Surratt. The other conspirators - Booth, Herold, Powell, Mudd and the rest -- looked very much like their photographs. The scaffold build for the execution was very much the real one. Booth's death in a Virginia barn was shown fairly accurately. The actor's at Ford's spoke the right line (\\"you sockdolagizing old mantrap!\\") at the time of the shooting. And the panic as Lincoln was carried through a throng of Washingtonians to the Peterson house was fairly convincing. And the recently-completed Capitol building (its dome was finished in 1863) reared up appropriately from an as-yet-unbuilt landscape.<br /><br />But after a day or two of thinking about the film and checking out historical sources, my ardor began to dim. For whatever reason, Redford changed historical details - nboth important and unimportant to the plot. He replaced Aiken's wife with a girlfriend. He erased Aiken's partner at the defense table. His Booth did not catch his spur on the bunting in front of the President's box in Ford's theater and was chased out by a theater goer. I'm sure that historians, not to mention the Civil War buffs, will find lots to quibble with regarding uniforms and tactics.<br /><br />But worse than all this is the way Redford skewed his characters. The Union generals were made to appear to be bloodthirsty buffoons or calculating knaves. The Union's witnesses were shown to be liars and drunks. Meanwhile, the Southerners were simple folk infused with love of country and honor. The echoes of \\"Birth of a Nation\\" were far too strong for this Union boy's taste. The story of the conspiracy, told in flashbacks, tended to exonerate Mary Surratt. She was never shown in the same room as Booth. Indeed there was only one scene in which Redford showed her with knowledge of the conspirators' plans. In prison, she was show as sickly, or praying with a priest, or with a rosary in her hand. Redford pretty much paints her as a poor, martyred religious mom just trying to protect her kids. The reality is far murkier. She was caught in numerous deceits. Her town of Surrattsville was a known nest of Confederate spies and couriers. The testimony of numerous witnesses spun a strong web of circumstantial evidence about her involvement in the plot.<br /><br />But no matter. Redford is not interested in retelling 150-year-old historical incident, but in commenting on the prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. This is a fine and even noble impulse. But to make the parallels fit, he needs to show Mary Surratt as an innocent caught in a web of paranoia and revenge. So, history must bend -- an inexcusable wrong that rewrites history to make a political point.<br /><br />Strictly from a storytelling point of view, the film was a disappointment. Aside from the stunning visuals, the narrative and acting were devoid of emotion. The actors often seemed as stiff as if they were posing for a daguerreotype. The state of high-alert in the Capitol and the loathing of the rebels during the still-hot Civil War were curiously muted. Redford insists on having Aiken repeat the courtroom clich&eacute; of yelling out at some injustice or other. At the trial, the other seven or so defendants were wasted - having little else to do than to sit while Surratt's trial went on. And the most interesting part of the story - the conspiracy to kidnap and then kill Lincoln - hardly made it to the screen.<br /><br />A movie that gave fresh insights to our contemporary fears about invaders and the need for justice would have been welcomed. But Redford's hack job on the events of the spring and summer of 1865 did violence and injustice to history, and failed to parallel the contemporary situation. And by so one-sidedly slandering Surratt's executioners, notably by showing Stanton as a Cheneyesque bender of the law, he may inadvertently revive ancient hatreds about the war that still simmer beneath the surface of our national discourse. The Civil War was a horrific fight that was fought once and is done. Let us not vilify the victors or ennoble the vanquished, no matter how just the cause.sses spun a strong web of circumstantial evidence about her involvement in the plot.    But no matter.

B000O8OTNC|5.0|Ok, so it is not a replacement for a full sharpening rig. That is not what this device is intended to do. What it does set out to do and accomplishes perfectly is to put a quick sharpener for a wide range of tools in your pocket or bag. In a just a few seconds my old swiss army knife, a pair of utility scissors and a pen knife were all rejuvenated. The device itself is plastic but solid, small enough to tuck away in the most modest pocket or bag, yet large enough hold comfortably and safely. My only dilemma now is whether to buy a second one... one for my daily bag and one for my hiking backpack. :-)
0307454541|2.0|I had high hopes for this novel and was disappointed.  While the core story is interesting and the Girl is a fascinating character, it was not enough to save the book for me.  The storytelling is very dry with far more exposition than I think it needed.  It took a long time to read because of this.  Despite the central theme being opposition to violence against women, I found the main character's relationships to be a shallow male fantasy.  It seemed a little hypocritical and off-putting.

The HD effects look STUNNING in true HD. Where the picture fails is in the scenes with very high contrast, graded with added noise to give it that \\"film\\" look for TV. Blown up to HD, this just looks bad... but it was a post-technique of the time. There are some added scenes in the episodes, which flesh out some of the storylines, and it's fantastic to relive the series once again.

B004H9TCH2|4.0|I was excited when R.E.M. released their 2008 'comeback' Accelerate.  After a few albums where the band seemed a bit lost (although there were still gems on those albums) they came back strong with Accelerate.  I was hoping they would continue the momentum with Collapse Into Now and I'm happy to say, they did!    Where Accelerate seemed very focus with it's lean-rock sound, Collapse Into Now contains a little variety.  The songs are well written and the SOUND is much better than it was on the last one - I thought the sound on Accelerate was horrible.  There's some lean rockers but there's also some mid-tempo tunes with that now famous mandolin sound.  One of the things I like about this album is the density of the sound... many layers but not too many giving the sougs some depth and emotion.  And of course there's Michael Stipe's voice!  Age has been kind to him - his voice is still strong but now he has more bottom end then he used to.      This one took a few listens for me to get, but it's worth the extra listens.  At first I wasn't sure I liked it, but after a few listens this has become an album that gets played a lot now.  I have to admit there's a song or two I'm not crazy about but the rest of the tunes are solid.  This album has a little something for everyone.
B000TETC6A|5.0|Bowie is one of those rare musicians who consistently produces great music.  Is the 70s Bowie the best? The 80s? The 90s? The debates rages on because all his eras are filled with really good music.  For me Hunky Dory is one of my favorites.  Many Bowie fans claim Ziggy Stardust, Space Oddity or Aladdin Sane as their all-time favorites.  Don't get me wrong, those are amazing records.  But Hunky Dory has such a eclectic range of the 1970s Bowie.  It's got pop hits like \\"Changes,\\" epic songs like \\"Life on Mars?\\" (which really displays Bowie's vocal range quite well), strange songs that work well like \\"Kooks,\\" and experimental songs like \\"Andy Warhol.\\"  This record was not just thrown together around a couple successful pop songs.  It is well crafted and and every song is Bowie at his best.  If you want to get to know Bowie's earlier years then start here.

1439102724|2.0|Jodi Picoult is known for writing thought-provoking novels about controversial subjects. This book may be controversial, but there are too many flaws with it to make it thought provoking. It's not going to open anyone's eyes or change anyone's mind. People on one side of the supposed argument will be glad that this book exists because of the positive light in which it portrays a certain demographic. People on the other side will be disappointed because the characters in the book who are most like them are portrayed to be all wrong, all the time. Usually in Picoult's book she includes some tidbits that make you think \\"maybe this type of person isn't what I thought. Maybe they aren't so bad after all\\". This book is different though.   All that aside, the book wasn't particularly well written. The protagonist is a music therapist. She has a master's degree, so she is obviously pretty smart. However, when she \\"speaks\\" about her struggles with infertility, she does so in a manner that is entirely too clinical. I have a medical condition. I have educated myself about it and am able to provide others with information about it, should they ask. When I speak about my condition, though, I don't sound as though I am reciting scientific facts from a Wikipedia article. This is what the book reads like, in portions. A Wikipedia article. I have a feeling that Picoult doesn't even know what some of the words she uses mean. It made the character a lot less personable and even though we have some things in common, I had a hard time making a connection with the character. I finished the book with great difficulty because of issues like this. Additionally, one thing that used to make Picoult's so great was the surprise endings. Now they're just predictable. It's starting to feel like she's the M. Night Shyamalan of fiction novels.
B002ZG99TA|4.0|Pretty enjoyable and suspenseful film.  I was under the impression that Denzel and the conductor were aboard the unstoppable train, but that didn't turn out to be true.  The surround sound added a lot to this film, the rumble of the unstoppable train tearing down the tracks, etc.  I can't image it would be enjoyable without surround sound.  All in all, a good movie.  Some predictably, but don't let that stop you!
0735619670|5.0|The tragedy for books that become classics is that there are many more people who have heard of them (or perhaps also bought them) than people who have read them. In this case, the fact that Steve McConnell's \\"Code Complete\\" is approximately 900 pages long doesn't help, either. Even so, this is a book that not only deserves to be read, but also rewards multiple readings.<br /><br />The Good: McConnell deserves credit for writing the first (and only?) readable encyclopedia of best practices on software quality, covering topics such as how to build classes, use data and control structures, debug, refactor, and code-tune. Yes, it would be nice if the book was updated to include substantive material on languages like Ruby or Python (cf. p. 65, Python \\"also contains some support for creating larger programs\\") but, in the words of Gertrude Stein, \\"Not everything can be about everything\\" -- though Code Complete does come pretty close. This book contains an astonishing number of practical points on a variety of topics. Here is a quasi-random selection: a) don't use booleans as status variables (chs. 5, 12), b) when you feel the need to override a function and have it do nothing, don't; refactor instead (ch. 6), c) when choosing variable names, avoid homonyms (ch. 11), d) if you decide to use a goto, indenting your code properly will be difficult or impossible (ch. 17), e) trying to improve software quality by increasing the amount of testing is like trying to lose weight by weighing yourself more often (ch. 22), f) make your code so good that you don't need comments, and then comment it to make it even better (ch. 32),  and finally the oft-repeated g) you should try to program into your language, not in it (ch. 34). McConnell also sprinkles the text with classic words of wisdom, e.g. \\"The competent programmer is fully aware of the strictly limited size of his own skull\\" (Edsger Dijkstra), \\"Never debug standing up\\" (Gerald Weinberg), \\"Copy and paste is a design error\\" (David Parnas), \\"Any fool can defend his or her mistakes -- and most fools do.\\" (Dale Carnegie). It is important to point out that even though this volume is encyclopedia-like, it does have both a sense of humor (e.g. \\"the encryption algorithm is so convoluted that it seems like it's been used on itself\\") and a clear authorial voice (e.g. \\"Though sometimes tempting, that's dumb.\\"). Another example of the latter: in ch. 33, after quoting Edward Yourdon at length, McConnell adds \\"This lusty tribute to programming machismo is pure B.S. and an almost certain recipe for failure\\".<br /><br />The Bad: overall the writing is very good, but the occasional infelicity reminds us that McConnell is human (e.g. p. 369 \\"A loop-with-exit loop is a loop in which\\", p. 809 \\"A program contains all the routines in a program.\\"). In a technical book of this breadth, minor mistakes are bound to creep in. For example, in ch. 10 McConnell mentions the different possible levels of a variable's scope in C++, and then adds that in Java and C# one can also use namespaces, thus effectively ignoring the existence of the namespace concept in C++ (which is baffling, given that he then discusses precisely that topic in ch. 11). Another example, this one more serious, is McConnell's recommendation that you should use a pointer - not a reference - if you want to pass by reference in C++ (ch. 13), something which is contrary to C++ best practices (see e.g. Sutter & Alexandrescu, \\"C++ Coding Standards\\", Item 25). A less technical point: in ch.2 McConnell criticizes Frederick Brooks for writing (in 1975): \\"Plan to throw one away; you will, anyhow\\". I found this to be bizarre, given that in the 1995 edition of \\"The Mythical Man-Month\\" Brooks states in no uncertain terms that he has changed his mind on this: \\"This I now perceive to be wrong\\" (p. 265). Given that Code Complete 2 was published nearly 10 years later  (in 2004), criticizing Brooks for his publicly repudiated former opinion seems improper. On a different note, although some of the on-line accompanying material is fascinating (e.g. the links to the original Dijkstra and Lawrence articles in ch. 17) many of the links are just electronic versions of McConnell's checklists or bibliographies, while some are simply disappointing. To name only a couple of these, as of this writing the link on p. 856 on the economics of XP is a dead link, while the one on p. 76 is downright embarrassing (it links to a google search for \\"emergent design\\"). Finally, even though the book has a dedicated website, no list of errata is provided there. If you dig deeper, you can find one on the O'Reilly website, but that is woefully inadequate, e.g. it contains no information on separate printings.<br /><br />The most common criticism one hears about this book is that any decent software developer should already know the material covered in it. Ironically enough, this is true. To quote Dr. Johnson: \\"People need to be reminded more often than they need to be instructed\\".<br /><br />Alex Gezerlisent note, although some of the on-line accompanying material is fascinating (e.g. the links to the original Dijkstra and Lawrence articles in ch. 17) many of the links are just electronic versions of McConnell's checklists or bibliographies, while some are simply disappointing.

B004PGO25O|3.0|The book is very inspirational but lacks overall content and experiences.  I could sum this book up in about one paragraph.  It talks about how not to sit there and speculate and to go out and chase your dreams.  You will crash and burn, but that's how you learn.  Get yourself back up and dust it off and go at it again with a refined idea.  It's worth reading if you have an hour or two to spare, but it won't change your life.  If you really want something, you already know that you have to go out and get it, so it's nothing profoundly new that hasn't been said before.  Still a descent read.

1594744769|4.0|To be honest, when I first started reading \\"Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children\\" I expected a haunting thriller, full of horror and danger.  That is not what this book is.  Instead, this book is fantasy/adventure combined with a very unique style of photography, which made the book better than I ever thought it would be.<br /><br />Story - Jacob Portman desires an adventurous life, much like the life his grandfather describes to him in various stories.  However, when Jacob realizes that he can never have an adventurous life, he just tries to be normal and fit in.  He's not popular or extremely smart, and there doesn't seem to be anything unusual about him at all; but when his grandfather dies and leaves Jacob a cryptic message, Jacob is sent on a hunt to find his grandfather's past and ends up traveling all the way to Wales.  Once there, Jacob discovers much more than he ever could have imagined about his grandfather and is thrown into the midst of a very peculiar situation.<br /><br />Writing Style - If I had to compare Ransom Riggs to any other author, I would have to compare him to Lemony Snicket.  In fact, this entire book reminded me very much of Mr. Snicket's \\"A Series of Unfortunate Events\\" books.  Don't get me wrong, Riggs did not steal Lemony Snicket's writing style at all, but Riggs just simply reminded me of him, which is a positive since I pretty much love anything that Snicket touches.<br />Something else that I feel Riggs did superbly was explain the detail of everything in the story.  Even without the occasional photographs of people and things in the story, I was able to visualize the locations and details because of the fantastic descriptions.<br />Now, as for the photographs, they added a whole new dimension to the story.  They didn't turn the novel into a picture book or something else that we normally associate with children; rather, they added a new level of immersion to the story, with the reader being almost able to see exactly what Jacob is seeing as he looks at the many photographs scattered throughout.<br />The book is truly addicting, but it isn't perfect; there are a few kinks that I feel needed to be worked out.  The major kink being the fact that the attitude of some of the characters just doesn't seem to match the story!  The abundance of cursing and crude humor just doesn't make sense with some of the characters or the plot of the story.  Also, there were a few things that weren't developed as much as possible and could have been explained more and built upon.<br /><br />Warnings - Language, Mild Violence, Mild Peril<br /><br />Overall - In all fairness, my last complaint was very nitpicky and small, and I don't want to give anyone the impression that this is not a good book.  For a first novel, it is fantastic!  There are a few things to improve on, but I think Mr. Riggs is off to an amazing start!  I immensely look forward to his second novel, which I assume is in the works based on the cliffhanger at this end of the story.  I would say that, most likely, teens will enjoy the book more than adults, but it really does have a very interesting plot that many will love.

B004LUHQ1G|4.0|I think Pat coming back with the group really helped them go back in time and make a great album, although i still think that TCATS is their best, this one is up there with it, if not close. All of their songs are catchy and well written. The aggression is here without having the album slow down too much. I myself like an album that just doesn't slow down, this one in no exception. What ever mood you're on, this album has it, but in awesome style. I would put a listing of standout tracks, but I'll be repeating myself again, everyone has their own favorite song on the album, which essentially is a good thing for the Foo's to hear, they made a good album that people can talk about end enjoy at the same time. Don't hesitate to buy the album, it's really worth! Probably the best album of the year so far.

B003XQRZ7E|5.0|For a moment while listening to this album I thought I was back in the 70's. Deep Purple comes to mind especially the bluesier side of them. This album not only has the players but also has great songs, which some super groups don't.     What else really needs to be said, all four of these guys are full of talent and sound like they are really enjoying themselves. I won't go into detail about each track as others have already done that more eloquently than I ever could but I will say in my opinion this is the best rock album to come out in the last few years. Everytime I listen to it, it just seems to get better.     If you like classic rock and blues you can't go wrong here.

B000PMLFRA|1.0|The changes sicken me, so it's great to see so many other people are going to boycott this crap.  I know I'm not buying anything with Jar-jar or kid Anakin again.  Best case scenario would be that ol' George is embarrassed by pitifully low sales of his blu ray masterpiece, and he decides to do what he did before and release another set later with the originals.  It could happen.  Maybe he'll even spiff 'em up this time instead of giving us that headache-inducing, blurry transfer.  After all, it's blu ray.  Come on, George.  Is that too much to ask?

B0036EH3WK|5.0|When I watched the first episode of LOST way back when it aired I was instantly hooked, it was amazing and I loved how it all unfolded as the years passed. Never once did I tire of the show, the characters, or the story. This is more than I can say for most shows that I love to watch.<br />When the show ended I couldn't believe it, it was a wild ride and I wanted to watch it all again.<br /><br />Thankfully, I can, and in amazing Blu-ray quality!<br /><br />This collection is just amazing, this is truly how a entire series should be released when it comes out, the creators did a phenomenal job making this box set! The black box itself is able to sit sturdily on a shelf with everything housed within without worry of it tipping over or falling off due to a shock to a shelving unit.<br />The actual case that the LOST Blu-Ray discs are housed in is amazing, it holds not only a game, a note with a clue, a black light pen, and a hidden dvd, but it just looks amazing! This is truly a center piece for any dvd/bluray collection!<br /><br />I love everything about this release, I have never been more excited and happy to own a complete television collection like I am with the LOST complete collection on BluRay.
0316098337|5.0|ROOM<br /><br />As I went out to cut our grass for the first time since reading ROOM, I had a very eerie feeling as I unlocked our shed and opened the door.  I glanced over at our neighbor's shed and it also gave me the creeps.  When I opened the doors and walked in my imagination took hold of me and I was seeing my garden shed through an entirely set of new eyes.  Not a very pretty image, ROOM.<br /><br />This is where Ma and Jack are living, virtual and hopeless prisoners of Old Nick.  Ma was abducted and has been held prisoner for over seven years in the back yard of Old Nick with no hope of escape in sight.  Jack is a product of this mad situation; a boy she loves dearly and wholly and forever, despite of how and why he was conceived.<br /><br />Without giving away any further details of the story and since there are well over 800 reviews on this fabulous book, I can only say this is one of the most different, interesting, scary, suspenseful, loving, joyful, depressing, exciting, and strange books I have ever read.  I HIGHLY recommend this book to everyone.<br /><br />While the subject matter is upsetting, it is a wonderful and heart-warming book.  Jack, who is five, and is your narrator, is charming and intelligent. He is wise for a five year old and his use of the English language is absolutely charming and adorable.  He is a brave little man, one who has known nothing but ROOM and Ma.  When things change drastically in his life, Jack is a champ.  His love for his Ma is pure and strong.  Ma is one character in literature I will forever admire and respect.  Donoghue has made these two characters so life-like and fleshed-out.<br /><br />The book is one that you cannot put down, one that will make you resent having to work, cook, do chores, put the book down for any reason.  The writing is so superb and believeable that at times I was on pins and needles, a nervous wreck, scared as to what would happen next to Ma and Jack.  I laughed, I cried, and if I could do them, I would have been doing cartwheels for these two brave and unusual characters.<br /><br />A story that is fresh from headlines in every paper in America, a circumstance that one prays they will never have to deal with in their life, ROOM is one of the best books ever written in my humble opinion.  Do not miss it.<br /><br />Thank you.<br /><br />Pamfor these two brave and unusual characters.

B0047Y0FGY|3.0|I eagerly bought this after the free sample had me in stiches. The rest of the book didn't quite keep pace with the stellar beginning, though.    For me, it felt a series of short stories that might've been better off if each had been written to stand alone. Instead, it felt like there was an effort to weave them together in style and theme and at times it just felt a bit forced. There were certainly some great laughs, but they were often far between.    While it wasn't as funny as I'd hoped, it did turn out to be more interesting than I'd expected, particularly in addressing the image of women and discrimination issues. Fey does a great job of presenting these thoughts from an interesting and personal perspective often mixing in a bit of humour without diminishing the seriousness of her observations.    Worth a read, but I probably won't get around to re-reading it.
B00003CXCD|5.0|It seems royalty never goes out of style. With the recent hulabaloo over the marriage of England's Prince William to commoner Kate Middleton, I set out to re-watch one of my favorite royal films of all time: 1953's \\"Roman Holiday\\". Directed by William Wyler and starring the formidable Gregory Peck and a then-unknown ingenue named Audrey Hepburn (who would go on to win an Oscar for this, her first major role), it combines romance, adventure, and a bit of light-hearted fun in the Eternal City.    Hepburn plays Princess Ann, the heiress to the throne of an unnamed European country. After visiting several capital cities, she lands in Rome, where, after a state dinner, she has a nervous breakdown. She simply wants to be a normal person, but duty to her country will not allow it. After being sedated, she sneaks out of the embassy (before the medication can take effect) to live a few hours on her own terms.     Needless to say, the sedative eventually DOES take effect, and Ann is found sleeping on the street by an American reporter, Joe Bradley (Peck). Not quite knowing what to do with the woman, he brings her back to his apartment and lets her crash on his couch. The following morning, after over-sleeping and seeing a picture of Her Royal Highness splashed across the front page of the paper, he realizes that the woman currently sleeping in his place is a princess - and he makes a bet with his boss that he can get an exclusive story from her.    Initially, the two have opposite ideas. Ann simply wants to play hooky from her duties, and is excited when Joe decides to join her for the day. The two, accompanied by Bradley's photographer friend Irving Radovich (played by a pre-Green Acres Eddie Albert), tour Rome's most famous locations, from the Piazza di Spagna to the Coliseum to the Mouth of Truth. Along the way, they run into adventures and mishaps involving one of the city's famous scooters.    Predictably, the two develop feelings for each other. However, Ann's holiday can only last a day, so the two must figure out what will happen when the clock strikes midnight and she turns back into a princess. It's a look at the driving forces that pull people in their lives, from love to family to duty to career.    Shot in black-and-white (though restored here) and filmed on location in Rome, \\"Roman Holiday\\" is one of those films that I never seem to tire of. There's something magical about it, though whether it has to do with royalty or the fact that it shows a great look at post-World War II Italy, I'm not sure. And while, like many have said, Cary Grant may have hammed up the lead male role more, there's something soothing about knowing that Gregory Peck will work it all out in the end.

0385333846|5.0|Slaughterhouse-Five is science fiction writing that will be timeless for generations of past, present and future readers. Kurt Vonnegut writes about the life of Billy Pilgrim as seen through pivotal moments in his life story. The book is especially interesting to read because it combines a science-fiction time twist, aliens and life out of order seen in a fourth dimension of never ending time.    Tralfamadorian aliens capture Pilgrim and transport him back to their planet. Through the aliens, he travels to his own life experiences including: his capture as an American soldier in WWII Germany, his time as a POW in Dresden, Germany (nicknamed \\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\" for which the book is named after), his married life after the war and, ultimately, his death; \\"So it goes.\\" These transforming life experiences and the people within them show Vonnegut's point of view and theme of the book. People Pilgrim experiences within his life story appear to have choices. Yet for Pilgrim, he cannot change his fate but only travel back to another place within his own story at a different point in time. Can anyone really chose their fate in life or is it pre-destined?    Vonnegut, the narrator, tells us the story, but the chapters are out of order, as Vonnegut allows Pilgrim to be \\"unstuck in time\\". The style of the book shifts the reader off balance forcing you to read closely and engaging in the confusion of Pilgrim's life. Pilgrim sees life as out of control, often senseless, as the horrors of war unfold. Random flashbacks throughout the story give insight to Vonnegut's thoughts on war: trauma, senselessness and meaninglessness. Revenge is shown to be the most senseless as Pilgrim's fated death comes when he is killed by Lazarro avenging another useless death; \\"So it goes.\\" Instantly following seeing his death, Pilgrim travels to another part of his life in a never ending story.     The end of the novel discusses the beginning of the novel. Time travel never really ends in the lifeof the Tralfamadorians. Vonnegut suggests that life cannot be changed even if you know the ending and want to go back and change it. Vonnegut uses the history of WWI which was, \\"The war to end all wars,\\" only to be succeeded by WWII twenty years later. In 1969 when Vonnegut wrote Slaughterhouse-Five, the United States was in the middle of the Vietnam War. More death, loss of life and the meaningless of war recycled, to again repeat itself. Controlled chaos in an uncontrollable life traps the reader in the endless circle; \\"So it goes.\\" No other book has created such an effective anti-war message as Kurt Vonnegut did by transporting the reader on an endless journey of space and time.

B004NSULHM|2.0|Theres a real problem with TKOL. Theres only 8 songs. And only 3 of them are any good.    Radiohead has built a near impregnable wall of \\"benefit-of-doubt\\" within its fanbase due to their past achievements. When the album dropped, every review on the net read something like \\"we don't like it much, but its Radiohead, so we must not get it\\".    Simply said, they've moved to far into this direction. The album is beautifully produced, with classic Nigelisms, but none of this conceals a weak song with weak chords and weak arrangements.    Bloom = Boring.    Morning Mr. Magpie = An example of everything wrong with Radiohead right now. Boring. Understated to a fault. No melody. Cerebral poly-rhythms.    Little By Little = Finally, a song! Something that reveals itself after 30 listens. A decent tune.    Feral = Garbage. Filler.    Lotus Flower = A Thom Yorke solo out-take. Weak.    Codex = Stunningly Beautiful. When this song arrives during a full album listen, its like a warm blanket in the cold.    Give Up The Ghost = House of Cards pt. 2. Sounds like a campfire sing along. Another beautiful song.    Seperator = Reminds me of the sun coming out on a Sunday morning. A nice grower, if not amazing.      And that is what I waited 3 years for. This is Radiohead's first mediocre album. They sound comfortable, and I mean that in the worst way. What a bummer.

B0043KK4N6|5.0|Music and singing is just as it is in the movie.  My daughters loved this movie and wanted to use the soundtrack to practice singing & dancing just like Christina Aguilera. There is no dialogue in between like some other soundtracks, just the music.  It's great and I'm pleased with the purchase.

As a legacy of the Middle Ages, habeas corpus became more firmly entrenched four centuries ago as a means of protecting the individual against unfair imprisonment, confinement or detention.<br /><br />Worryingly, it's taken something of a battering fairly recently in the controversies surrounding the war on terrorism; for example, detention without trial and the imprisonment of detainees at Guantanamo.  So this book is timely, dealing with these topical issues, but not before offering up a thorough and useful examination of -- as promised by the title -- the law of habeas corpus itself.<br /><br />First, there is an introduction to the history of habeas corpus, tracing its development primarily from its seventeenth century origins.  It was in 16th and 17th centuries that the writ of habeas corpus took is modern form gaining its conspicuous place as a fundamental ingredient of the UK's Constitution.<br /><br />The significance of habeas corpus in the modern context is that it empowers the court to secure the release of individuals from unlawful custody over a range of circumstance, from detention in prison to the custody of a child, to patients detained for compulsory medical treatment and, as in a number of current high profile cases, individuals wrongly held in detention as the result of the war on terrorism.<br /><br />So fundamental a liberty is habeas corpus that all too many take it for granted, which offers all the more reason why it should be jealously guarded by those charged with ensuring its preservation.<br /><br />Interestingly, this important book started life as the thesis for the D. Phil. at Oxford University by one of the three learned authors, The Hon. Mr Justice R.J. Sharpe, now of the Ontario Court of Appeal.  With subsequent revisions and updates, the book has remained topical and is now published by OUP in this latest third edition.<br /><br />The authors have endeavoured to maintain the structure and organization of previous editions while examining all recent developments including, for example, judicial review, immigration cases and the implications of the Human Rights Act 1998, especially when conflicts of interest have emerged between liberty and security.<br /><br />We were amused to read a quote in \\"The Times\\" letters column some time ago from a Mr Benjamin Franklin who remarked in effect that those who would sacrifice freedom for safety deserve neither freedom nor safety.<br /><br />Anyone who is concerned, especially in a professional capacity, with the issues raised by this 250 page book should read it.<br /><br />Meticulously footnoted throughout with extensive tables of cases, national legislation, secondary legislation, as well as treaties and conventions (on both sides of the Atlantic) plus a great index, it points the way to literally hundreds of avenues for further research on the evolution and vulnerability of this fundamental right.ree learned authors, The Hon.

So if you are in any way involved in property transactions or administration, expert or not, you should ideally have this definitive guide to hand.  `Property transactions are the most expensive anyone is likely to encounter' says the consultant editor, Mike Arnold ...(and are subjected, he adds) `to the most complex legislation imaginable, usually where more than one tax is involved'.<br /><br />It's in this head-spinningly complex financial environment that practitioners are grateful for this ever reliable volume with its stated aim of `guiding those in practice towards a full and complete understanding of all the relevant taxes.'<br /><br />A former partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers, Arnold heads a team of property taxation experts, each of whom has contributed a chapter in his or her specialist area.  With case law featuring strongly in the text throughout, the range of topics and sub-topics is vast and includes everything from Real Estate Investment Trusts to Capital Expenditure - Allowances, to Capital Gains Tax and VAT to Islamic Funding structures and - new chapter here - Property Planning in a Recession.<br /><br />To help you build up your expertise even further in this field, (i.e. helping to ensure that your clients pay less tax on their properties) the expected research tools are in place, including extensive tables of cases, statutes, statutory instruments, and European legislation -- plus of course the handy and comprehensive  index.<br /><br />`Nothing stands still in the tax world surrounding property,' warns Mike Arnold and in much the same vein, Liz Pearce, Chief Executive of the British Property Federation remarks, in her appreciative Foreword to this volume, that `a year is a positive lifetime in the property industry'.  So if you have yet to acquire this year's edition of Tolley's for your tax library, rush out and buy it now.this field, (i.e. helping to ensure that your clients pay less tax on their properties) the expected research tools are in place, including extensive tables of cases, statutes, statutory instruments, and European legislation -- plus of course the handy and comprehensive  index.       `Nothing stands still in the tax world surrounding property,' warns Mike Arnold and in much the same vein, Liz Pearce, Chief Executive of the British Property Federation remarks, in her appreciative Foreword to this volume, that `a year is a positive lifetime in the property industry'.

When ordering make sure you get it from Amazon and not a reseller or there is no guarantee on what you are getting.  It came packaged new in the Tissot box with all the materials.  I looked for this watch all over to make sure I was really getting a Tissot and not a knock off as well as a good price.  Amazon was a clear winner with a substantial savings over Tissot retail dealers as well as the shoptissot.com website.    It got here in one day even though I paid for 2 day shipping.  Nice job Amazon.
B00000J7SS|4.0|let me preface this by saying that i'm not a jazz-head, nor am i familiar with miles davis' work, but i do appreciate jazz as well as all kinds of music. i got this album simply because i had heard about it and that miles davis was pretty awesome, also that a lot of notable musicians played with him. so anyway, i had heard that bitches brew was a sort of ground-breaking album, and naturally i had to check it out (especially after seeing the album art!). i am listening to this album right now so i'll try to say what i want to express...  this album seems, to me at least, to consist entirely of jamming and improvisation. there are definite song structures here, but it seems like they just jammed the whole thing. this aspect seems a little more prevalent on the first disc. the first song alone jams and jams until there's almost no order behind it, just everyone going off into their own worlds. not that it's not good, but listening to this it makes me wonder if that's the point; to make you wonder what they're doing and why, and to question modern conventions about music. it's definitely cool and interesting to listen to, but it almost sounds like nonsense. to fully appreciate this music it might take several solid, good, dedicated listens. this album doesn't seem to reveal itself too easily.   and to follow with my title, i wonder if being high would make sense of this album. because, you know, these guys were on another planet

Feels at times like an old palm pilot calendar in that respect.  The widget really needs touch / drag functionality.  Otherwise, this is a fantastically well-built calendar that will make you more productive.  The tap-drag to view multiple dates is intuitive and genius.  Bottom line - worth the purchase.  Seems to be updated regularly.  Hopefully the widget and overall look will be improved in future updates.

9380028245|3.0|I've read the original Frankenstein, and this is a pretty good short-read graphic novel version of it. I'd recommend this for middle schoolers and older: I would hesitate to recommend it for elementary school students due to some frightening and gory content. I think this would be a good aid, also, for someone who had to read the original novel and just wanted a quick overview of what happened. There are some parts where the transitions are a little rocky, but overall I thought this was a decent enough \\"summary\\" graphic novel version of Frankenstein.

B002ZG99QS|4.0|This was a lot better than I thought it would be. I had no idea what to expect and was pleasantly surprised. In many ways, it was better than the original. The special effects and a lot of the action scenes were much better done and not near as monotonous.<br /><br />It was really great to see The Dude back again. Jeff Bridges is one of my favorite actors and he does great in a dual role, one the real him and the other a computer generated facial reconstruction of what he looked like 30 years ago. An good self and an evil self.<br /><br />Olivia Wilde finally gets to show her chops in this role. She plays more than a bit part and does it well.<br /><br />The kid that plays the son does a splendid job and brings fresh blood to the franchise.<br /><br />Sure, there have got to be some plot holes somewhere, but I never really noticed. I was too busy enjoying myself. It all led up to the inevitable climax and to the happy/sad ending that I saw coming a mile away. That is the reason for my four stars. I didn't want it to end the way it did, but just knew the directors and writers were not going to let it end any other way. They probably said it couldn't end any other way (which is bull), but who am I? Anyway, it still ended happy enough that I left it with a smile on my face. Highly recommended.
B004A8ZWSS|4.0|I didn't go into this movie looking for academy award performances and certainly didn't find them. As for a plot that makes sense, I didn't find that either. I've seen plots on SyFy that made better sense. However, I did come away from the experience with a smile on my face, and that's all that matters.<br /><br />Ms Jolie did an awesome job of looking awesome. She excels at that. In this movie, she reminded me an awful lot of Vanessa Ferlito, or maybe it's the other way around. In any case, it seems she posed more than moved throughout much of the movie. That was okay. She played a good foil for Captain Jack... I mean Johnny Depp. As the schlubby tourist math teacher, he did a pretty decent job. On occasion, however, a bit of his Jack Sparrow slur would leak through in his speech. It wasn't distractive or anything, just a bit of bias I had.<br /><br />With all that out of the way, the movie started rather slow, with all the foreign detectives tailing her, especially with the annoying subtitles. This is a good time to mention that you must have your picture ratio set properly on the TV or the subtitles will be cut off. In our case, it was just plain annoying to have to keep switching from English to subtitles, back and forth. Luckily, it wasn't all the time, but enough to slow things down, especially during the first half of the movie. One of the big plot holes is where Timothy Dalton tells Paul Bettany to close down the case in the first quarter of the film, which Bettany doesn't, then tells him again at the end of the film. Will he the second time? We will never know, but that is just a small example of the things that do not add up in the plot. There are many more.<br /><br />It all doesn't matter. The European scenery is fantastic, the Angelina scenery is fantastic, and I guess for the girls, the Johnny scenery is also fantastic. The interplay between the main characters is decent if not a bit underdone. The interplay between the secondary characters, as in the law-enforcement people, is more for comedic effect than really serious. It was a shock to see Paul Bettany playing a good guy for a change. I keep thinking of him in that role in DaVinci code. The final plot twist could be a shocker to some people if you don't look too deep into things, or it could be totally implausible to others.<br /><br />Not a bad rental.

0395951054|5.0|I dont understand, to begin with, all the reviews of how difficult a read this book is. In the context of the times, any person interested in history will have a full understanding of Germany from the early 1900s to the time this book was written. Personally I think for the subject matter Hitler did in fact practice what he preached-\\"All propaganda has to be popular and has to accommodate itself to the comprehension of the least intelligent of those whom it seeks to reach.\\" With short sentences and alot of breaks this book flies by. Also he is repetitive to the point that even the slowest learners are pounded again and again,  with slight variances to the same points, examples- The November criminals, parliamentarianism-which is my favorite, Jews and so on and so forth.    Do you think that what he says has any significance not just in understanding the past but also the future? For example, his ravings against stock exchange and international markets. The idea that once a society does put money above all else, the government loses its real reasons for existing, which according to Hitler are not economic, but rather to protect the culture and nationality of a people. Once the government worships money as the true god, a country falls into decadence. Here, I will admit I agree with Hitler, which would automatically classify me as a \\"neo-nazi\\", but thats far from the case. I dont agree with the belief that the jews were at fault, I cant, because of my ethnicity, agree with the aryan race domination, but damn its hard to disagree with Hitler when it comes to social and governmental issues. His ability to classify all enemies into one group was either his genius or madness, or both. Now, communism, marxism, social democracy, parliamentarianism, the lost war and even syphilis are all due to one enemy-The Jew.    This book is a must read, not only for its historical value but also to understand the future.This book was not written by the Hitler we all know today, but an ambitious Hitler before his rise to power. A clear picture develops of a man who was no longer a nobody, the Beer Hall Putsch gave him his first taste of fame and power. Also noteworthy are not only his analysis of historical events, but his predictions of the future of Germany and the world.

B004G6009K|5.0|A few weeks ago, I rented the Disney movie \\"Tangled\\" from Redbox (boo-hoo it had to go back the next day) and watched it with my family for Friday Family Movie Night. It was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING; phenomenal from beginning to end! The songs like \\"When Will My Life Begin?\\", \\"Mother Knows Best\\", and \\"I See the Light\\" was very incredible. At first, I really didn't think I would like it because it was a Disney Princess movie (although inside, I REALLY wanted to see it), but I don't know why I was so blind! I loved it! Now, I'm saving up for this version of \\"Tangled\\"(boo-hoo about the price, and about raising it, \\"Stop, no more! You'll just upset me!)! Can't wait till then!

But then it got better - a lot better.  Most of the movie had excellent video quality, with great detail.  But, there were a couple of scenes that had grain.

B000PKLSCE|3.0|You know sensitive piano ballad albums, they often have a moody front cover, a photo of our hero looking 'emotional', perhaps as if deep in thought, awakening that inner genius to write some great lyric or spine-chilling melody. Or, perhaps, since back in 1970 no-one knew who Elton John was, a moody photo of someone looking emotional was, somewhere by themself, was to entertain the idea this was some how sensitive singer/songwriter piano ballad music. And perhaps, the listener will be rather pleased in that regard, most notably the 'sensitive' part.     Elton John's sophomore 'debut album' shows Elton wearing Bernie Taupin's heart fairly and squarely on his sleeve, which means, well, I guess you could say 'heartfelt'. Although a fan's favourite target, 'First episode at Hienton' is particularly engaging, with it's ringing, eerie synths, and the harpsichord driven delicacy of 'I need you to turn to'. It is definitely his enthusiasm that drives the rockers; there aren't any guitars on them. And then there's that Paul Buckmaster. What an imaginative lad he is, and this is possibly his finest outing (with Elton)     Elton wouldn't be one of those people who believes in 'too much of a good thing' now would he? Oh ok, so it's just a coincidence that a lot of these songs sound VERY SIMILAR. He has proved over the last 40 years how diverse he can be, even if this album is narrow-focused. Be sure to pick up the bonus tracks for the energy assault of 'Bad side of the moon', don't worry, it's not as scary as it sounds! Rating ***1/4 (3.25)

I couldn't seem to put it down, so much that my family acted as if I was neglecting them.

It became the Mortal Life of Rebeccca Skloot  a personal diary , which would not exist without  the Lacks, Ms Skloots personal story is exploitative  and frankly  boring . The writers personal  journey could not elicit  my interest and  actually made me feel complicit in the exploitation of the Lacks. I was not interested in her story, it was self promoting and showed very little understanding of the deep wound that racism has left in those who have been exploited used .

B004IQMXD4|4.0|She's not in it to reach number one on the charts. She's got the credibility to come out with music she wants to create.  Much of this album goes back to her roots but for 2011.  She found a great partner with Dave Stewart.  You can hear everything from Buckingham Nicks to Bella Donna, The Other Side of the Mirror to Trouble in Shangri-La. This time it's about Stevie - what she wants, what she loves and the end result is not some cookie-cutter album but an album that reflects her artistry and poetry in a myriad of ways. If you appreciate her for what she is, this is definitely an album to get!

Yes, the second book will cost you more than the first but the author delivers and I was just happy that there was another book to read and another....     I have gotten caught up in the \\"cheap books\\" available on kindle.  Yes, some of them are great books at a teaser price to introduce you to the writer and some are gems that couldn't find a traditional publisher -but many of them are just poorly told, unedited stories.

For me though it was \\"dark\\" and a downer dealing with drug abuse and nonfunctional family life. I see enough of that for real. This movie reflects what I have heard about the \\"sleaziness\\" of boxing and the way some boxers rise from the bad side of life through it. The movie was technically ok but not my cup of tea. You should be in a \\"neutral\\" frame of mind as you watch it. It could be good for you.

B004G6009K|5.0|Comment: Oh boy, if there was ever a movie to debunk the myth from 3D home disbelievers (\\"3D Zombies\\") this is it. I am an early adopter of 3D in the home and can usually complain or nitpick about the 3D releases for the home. My main complaint has been \\"3D stereo ghosting of the background\\". Even with this intermittent flaw I usually judge the 3D in home Blu-rays as good or better than the theater. I have seen the majority of 3D releases in the theater and own most of these movies as they become available. So... I know what I am talking about when I say... \\"Ladies and Gentlemen, this is by far the best and most flawless 3D animated movie I have seen in the home so far\\"!!! The movie is your standard Walt Disney formula. It is a tried and true formula... updated for todays children and \\"morals\\". The 3D just works and does not get in the way or draw unnecessary attention to itself. My equipment is last years state of the art Samsung, but any other \\"new\\" equipment should work just as well. If I had a wish (or complaint) about the state of 3D, I would like to see \\"real\\" movies with this state of the art 3D Quality. Is anyone beside me growing tired of animated 3D films?

Bugs: Occasionally, for no apparent reason, game locks up on me &amp; I am forced to either remove my battery or wait for it to timeout.  Sometimes this happens quickly, other times I can play for an hour or so and it will not occur.  Always happens while fishing.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|kindle versions may cost more sometimes but w being able to read and lose myself in epic novels like this series anywhere is priceless. when i find a spectacular story i cant put it. i down take it with me everywhere to read anytime i have a spare moment, or break at work......or pause at a stoplight. i never want to carry around another 300 plus book around again just to save a few dollars.
B004Q1FDHO|5.0|very very addictive game... finally a game worth playing that is just plain fun grate for killing time... would highly recomend
B002ZG974M|4.0|***This review may contain spoilers.***<br /><br />I am a professed baby junkie.  Merely seeing a baby or toddler in person or in a picture elates and uplifts my mood and emotions.  Therefore, I predicted that I would appreciate and savor the \\"Babies\\" DVD I purchased recently.  My prediction satisfyingly came true.  \\"Babies\\" is a contemplative but absorbing celebration of these remarkable beings.<br /><br />The movie is essentially a \\"What if\\" stylistic experiment.  What if we followed the broad outlines of a wildlife documentary, but with the subject being young human children instead of lions or elephants?  What if we select a global approach by focusing on four children (one African, two Asian, and one North American) and compare and contrast their babyhood?  What if we improved on the wildlife documentary and eliminated the distracting narration and commentary that purports to understand the subjects' motivations.  What if we simply sit and watch the babies do their things and draw our own individual conclusions?  It's a daring, risky approach and will not appeal to all cinematic tastes.<br /><br />For example, if you prefer fast-paced, action-oriented documentaries, you probably won't enjoy \\"Babies\\".  If you prefer deliberate, observant, leisurely paced stories, you will probably be more partial to the story.  Of course, if you adore children, you will find paradise.  The babies are the Namibian girl Ponijao, the Mongolian boy Bayarjargal, the Tokyo girl Mari, and the San Franciscan girl Hattie.  We see all four during the interval from birth to about one year old.  We see them interacting with their parents, their siblings, other babies, and their environment.  They all exhibit the behaviors we expect from babies: wonderment, curiosity, contentment, frustration, fear, and triumphant satisfaction.  We see them grow in experience and independence.  Even though they may occasionally face an overzealous sibling, a scary gorilla and tiger, or a boring Native American spirit exhortation, all the babies exhibit spunk, intelligence, perception, and resilience.  It's fun, charming, and even emotional to watch them react to something, and sometimes not even react at all as life swirls around them. I simply loved them all, and was relieved and gratified that their parents seemed to do so as well.<br /><br />Of course, the babies' socioeconomic backgrounds run the gamut from the \\"primitive\\" savanna to the ultra-modern city, with Bayarjargal's milieu being an unusual hybrid of Mongolian farming steppe and technologically advanced yurt (including a laptop computer and satellite dish).  But as other posters have commented, babies really don't care a whit about wealth and possessions.  All that matters is that they receive love, support, and guidance, and they certainly do.  Also, each baby is allowed a certain amount of freedom to explore his or her surroundings; no parent, when we occasionally see them, acts as a jailor or micromanager.  They step in only when they have to (i.e. the baby is in danger of being hurt - which very seldom happens in the movie).<br /><br />I think part of a baby's appeal is their ultimate mystery.  Sure, we can usually figure out (from coos and cries) whether a baby is happy, sad, or frightened.  But when they simply stare at something, what are they thinking?  Nobody, not even the baby, really knows.  I appreciate that \\"Babies\\" keeps silent and non-judgmental about that mystery and does not indulge psychological theories and speculation about the childrens' motivations.  However, the viewer may come up with some of his or her own.<br /><br />The movie rotates more or less in sequence among the four children, which all more or less receive equal time.  Again, the movie is non-judgmental about the childrens' race and circumstances; for example, it does not wring its hands about Ponijao's \\"poor\\" upbringing or tout Mari's and Hattie's formative advantages (e.g. baby yoga classes).  Babies don't care about those things and the movie gently reminds us that adults shouldn't either.  All that matters are the love babies receive and the pleasure they give in return.<br /><br />\\"Babies\\" made me chuckle with the children's unself-conscious antics but even more often made my eyes mist with their mere presence.  The movie reminds us that babies are one of nature's (God's) true masterpieces and that their existence is a comforting reminder of humanity's ultimate immortality.ults shouldn't either.

B00000J2PH|5.0|Tapestry is a modern masterpiece. I remember hearing these songs as a child, I knew every word and phrase because this album was played so often and every song was so good; and I could recognise that even as a child. Carole King's creative span really culminates in this album where she writes and performs her own material (almost every song authored/co-authored) the songs and her interpretation  so vastly different from earlier songs she had written that were performed by the Drifters, Shirelles and other artistes (Will You Still Love Me Tommorrow, Up on the Roof, et al.)     What is so remarkable is that every song is truly wonderful in musical and lyrical content and sung just perfectly - with feeling and meaning and never overdone or underdone and remains fresh forty years on. A rare accomplishment of back-to-back hits on an album which was not a `Best of..' or `Greatest Hits' - (Ultimate collections weren't invented in 1971). I believe our household went through two copies of the vinyl `back in the day' and I got my own CD much later on.    A worthy addition to any collection of modern music.
B003L77GRY|5.0|I. Am. The. Biggest. Freaking. Dexter. Fan.<br /><br />Yet, this review comes from someone who does reviews quite frequently, as sort of a TV connoisseur, and I like to think I come from an unbiased standpoint.<br /><br />Season 5 does get off to a great start, but there is something that every Dexter fan must remember: it would be impossible, lest it is a couple of seasons down the road, to top season 4. Season 4 can't be beaten; not by another TV show, and not even by itself. With that in mind, season 5 was simply another phenomenal (though not as good as 4) season. The depth of the characters still takes us deeper, Dexter's psyche still tends to amaze, and the fatherhood aspect flavored in adds something Dexter has never had before: split personalities. Dexter is truly a killer. He is truly a Father. He is truly emotionless. Yet He truly loves his children, his sister....Lumen. Yes, I said Lumen.<br /><br />Bottom line without going into pain staking detail, this season is top notch like all the others, I just think it serves as a bit of a breather after season 4's roller coaster. Watch it. Buy it. Collect all these seasons, for it will make history as the best TV Show to date.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B004FP1WX0|1.0|Although i read the reviews that clearly pointed out this was a terrible movie, I watched.  I would have rather spent the hour and a half creating ways to slowly kill myself in a bathtub, or watch my parents shower.  I am now dumber for watching this movie and may God have mercy on my soul.
B004G6009K|5.0|A charming Rapunzel story that can be enjoyed by boys and girls alike.  My 9 year old son has no problems telling anyone that he loves this movie, especially in 3D!!
1601251556|4.0|As outlined in other reviews, this is a very simple mat (laminated card board). I glued it on a thicker piece of cardboard so it does not slide on the table. Our group has been using it for a few months, and it has been serving its purpose well. I'm especially satisfied with the fact that erasing is easy, no marks were left behind, even when drawings were left for a couple of day (I'm using the cheapest marker I could find).
159420229X|5.0|Journalist Josh Foer went to the U.S. Memory Championships to cover the event and write an article about it. But after meeting the competitors and learning more about what they do, Foer decided to train for the next year's championship. He won.<br /><br />Moonwalking with Einstein: The Art and Science of Remembering Everything is Foer's memoir of that year. He takes us with him as he learns to hone his memory skills in such a way that he can memorize a deck of cards, or sets of faces and names, or long strings of random numbers, or unknown poems ~ each in just a few minutes. He does this by using memory palaces, which are basically places in his mind (usually houses and other buildings) into which he places each of the items he needs to remember. Then he can walk through that palace in his mind, and see everything on the list.<br /><br />This isn't a how-to book, though. All of the negative reviews I've seen about this book are from people who go into it thinking they're going to learn how to remember better. It's not going to happen. While I expect I could memorize a short grocery list using the technique he outlines ~ and asks the reader to try with him ~ that's probably about it. This is a memoir of his experience, not a self-help book that is going to help you improve your memory.<br /><br />In addition to telling about his training and all the quirky people he interacted with during that time, Foer also gives some amazing stories of people who have extraordinary natural memory, and others with extreme amnesia. He talks of the history of memory training, and the current lack of education about memory in today's schools.<br /><br />If you are interested at all in the art of memory through the ages, how people in the past were able to memorize all the stories, songs and poems because there was no written language, and how memory training has evolved over the years, as books and later technology took over the remembering for us, I highly recommend Moonwalking with Einstein. I found it to be a fascinating look at how memory works.cinating look at how memory works.
0670022411|5.0|Loved it!!  It is like twilight for adults with a lot of interesting history and other story lines.  I can't wait for the next book!!
B0042JTDXK|2.0|I am a real Josh Groban fan and don't feel that this album measures up to his previous ones. It doesn't seem to have a \\"signature\\" song.  The songs seem lackluster and ordinary, whereas previous songs such as You're Still You and You Raise Me Up leave me singing along.  I should have paid more attention to ratings.  Would recommend that Groban devotees wait for his next album.  My advise is:  pay attention to the ratings
0743442539|5.0|This isn't exactly a Jason Bourne type story, but it is everything I wanted from a spy novel.  \\"The Spy who Came In From the Cold\\" leaves you thinking about the story, the ideologies and the characters long after the novel is finished; all things that define a great book from a good one.  I don't want to give anything away, but everything that happens in this book, right on from page one, is 100% important to the progression of the story.  This book is cerebral, yet easy to comprehend, especially once everything comes together at the end - how blind I was to what was going on!  The way I felt after reading this... I doubt I could ever begin describe, but it is both wonderful and chilling at the same time.
0061537969|1.0|Wow did I think this book was awful! If you don't care about car racing there is nothing of value from cover to cover. The story is is a never-ending downer of ridiculous, trite painfully obvious plot points. It's a tear-jerker for sure, but there is nothing truly thoughtful or novel here. If i hadn't bought it on kindle, I'd return it for the pretentious nothingness that it is.
B004X0XA82|5.0|I love this style of folk,pop,melodic music! Can't get enough of Fleet Foxes. Hopefully everyone has a ticket to their tour!

B004LFO0FG|4.0|Britney is back, and she makes that very clear on her latest album.  `Femme Fatale' is dripping with character and just oozes sex appeal that laces every track and makes Britney and undeniable force.  She really dominates here, switching up her style to modernize her sound and make herself relevant again in a genre populated by the stylings of Lady Gaga and Katy Perry.  Britney is back to prove she still has a place in your stereo, and `Femme Fatale' proves that with ease.<br /><br />So, here is a little breakdown of the great, the good and the undecided.<br /><br />The great:<br /><br />`Till the World Ends' is slick and simply put rather stunning for what it is.  It booms with slick beats and soft vocals that are enticing and commanding at the same time.  The high register on the chorus are sublime, and the chants add and anthem appeal to the track.  It is extremely club heavy, which is a great direction for Britney since it shows an evolution to her music.  `Hold it Against Me' was the PERFECT choice for the album's first single.  It's edgy, sexy and straightforward.  It has that `Gaga' feel to it, in that it dives headfirst into her techno/pop genre, and it contains some beautifully controlled vocals from Britney.  In fact, Britney has rarely sounded better than she does on this album.  The musical breakdown on the bridge is flawless (that whole \\"give me something good\\" part) and just creates one of the best tracks the `Princess of Pop' has delivered in a long time.  I love the contrast of soft and hard from the chorus to the verse, and the fact that it is the reverse of the usual (in that the chorus is far softer than the verse) also adds a layer of intrigue to the song.  `Inside Out' has a great tone.  I actually LOVE this song.  It may be my favorite on the album.  It has a soft musicality that is accompanied by slickly delivered vocals that just slide right off of Britney's tongue with expert precision.  `Drop Dead (Beautiful)' just nails the whole club tone.  Sure, the vocals are overshadowed by the electronic aspect of the track, but it works.  The chorus just booms with excitement.  `Gasoline' has a great rock edge to it, that Britney OWNS with such ferocity.  It just melts in your ears.  I love the spunk she brings to her delivery of the chorus.  It's direct and almost aggressive and yet playful at the same time, especially with the high-pitched backing vocals.  It's just so darn catchy!<br /><br />The (very) good:<br /><br />`I Wanna Go' is fun and sassy with a nicely constructed beat.  The pre-chorus grew on me considerably, and the chorus itself, while feeling a tad disjointed, has a nice air of nostalgia wrapped up in it.  It's a good song, bordering on great.  I have a feeling that this could be considered `great' by me in a few months.  `Seal It With a Kiss' also works pretty well.  The beat is a tad simplistic, but it works well for the tone of the track.  The verse structure is great, but the chorus leaves a bit to be desired.  It feels a tad lazy in its execution.  `Trip to Your Heart' is soft and sweet and feels almost fairy-tail like in its delivery.  It could have used a little more edge, to even it out a bit, but it kind of works.  I can't tell if `Criminal' is great or just deceptively good.  I mean, I really like it and yet I kind of don't.  The tone is strange, feeling almost detached from the remainder of the album, and yet it feels almost appropriately tagged onto the end of this star-turned album.  Her vocals are distant and yet they pierce.  I have to listen to this one a bit more.  Maybe it's the best track on the whole album, I just haven't realized that yet!<br /><br />The decent (or the undecided):<br /><br />`How I Roll' is a bit of a conundrum since everything I like about it (the absurd uniqueness of it all) is everything I can't stand about it.  It is so different (the vocals and the musical arrangement) and yet I'm not quite sure it really works entirely.  I'm kind of over Will.i.am, and he spews his personality all over `Big Fat Bass', which borders on `very good' but settles into `decent' thanks to his presence.  He just consumes everything he touches, taking away the artists individuality in order to reflect his own taste.  That said, there are elements of this song that really work nicely.  `Trouble For Me' feels like a Katy Perry song.  It's pretty good, but out of place on the album and just doesn't possess any `pop'.  It quickly feels generic, and the pre-chorus is terribly unbecoming.<br /><br />In the end, this is best thing she's released in a long while.  It actually flows (for the most part) from start to finish, and even the songs I'm less fond of contain intriguing aspects that make them admirable (all except `Trouble For Me', which is just `eh').<br /><br />For those of you interested; my ranking:<br /><br />1) Inside Me<br />2) Till the World Ends<br />3) Gasoline<br />4) Hold it Against Me<br />5) Drop Dead (Beautiful)<br />6) I Wanna Go<br />7) Criminal<br />8) Seal it With a Kiss<br />9) Trip to Your Heart<br />10) How I Roll<br />11) Big Fat Bass<br />12) Trouble for Meh borders on `very good' but settles into `decent' thanks to his presence.  He just consumes everything he touches, taking away the artists individuality in order to reflect his own taste.

B0034G4OXQ|4.0|The Hereafter is a subtly-layered American movie with a foreign flair that glimpses into a continuing beyond death. The style of the movie and pace--brings to mind the style of Akira Kurosawa and how he introduced different complex characters and then wove the characters stories and recollections together.  The movie follows three people as they deal with elements of death, life, and love.  It interweaves the stories of the three people together in a suprising ending.  It plays on the themes of death, life, relationships and loves like a jazz song that is at times sad and inspirational.    The three main characters are played wonderfully, especially the younger actor who played the boy.  The cinematography is excellent with locations adding to the plot of the movie.    This movie really highlights Eastwood's versatility as a director.  Why?  It harkens back to earlier movies and shows his exploration as a director.    Anyone that enjoys films with nuances and flows and rhythm--like a well-played jazz song--will enjoy this movie.
B003Y5H50G|5.0|Just loved this movie, great visuals with the fractal zooms and just great all around cinematography.  Great Sci-Fi story line in a near Hitchcock like action thriller and Cooper is perfect for the leading role, Abbie Cornish is gorgeous and solid in her part, would have liked to see more of her and  that romance developed.  Same with DeNiro who just nailed his part, could have seen more. That is what sequels are for I guess and I hope there is one.  But most importantly, the whole movie was ENTERTAINING from beginning to end!    This movie has stuck with me like no other movie since The Matrix, definitely see it on DVD if you missed it at the theatre.
B004E2XAHK|5.0|The Cd is in great condition.The new sound from Within Temptation takes some getting used to,but otherwise I love it.
B004FOA84A|1.0|Force closes immediately on launch.  :(   Motorola Atrix, multiple versions    most likely didn't account for qHD resolution.   Would love to give it a try though.
B004L49K20|5.0|Yes, I bought the iTunes version in December. Yes, I had to have the CD anyway. I wasn't necessarily expecting much from the bonus tracks, but I have to say that \\"Mediterranea\\" is my favorite song on the album. Maybe even one of my top 5 DD songs. Overall the album is sold Duran Duran, and it's been in rotation in my car CD player since it arrived. Welcome back, boys!
1439190275|5.0|I have enjoyed reading this book.  While I didn't agree with the original Atkins diet, this one is a better fit to my lifestyle.  I have been using this as a guideline for four months and have lost 20 pounds.  I'm glad, for me, that it is not a quick weight loss diet.  I know I will continue with this \\"life style\\" and reach my goal weight. I am very satisfied to follow this diet plan.
0385523394|4.0|This was a choice for our book group.  We were able to discuss the mistakes of young people and then followed the journey to see how it changed her life.  We discussed the inequality of the penal system, the fact that no job training is given to the prisoners, the fact that when you are in for a long time, prison is where you feel safe.  We also discussed the degree of responsibility Piper had to those she impacted, how her circumstance was different from other women in the prison because she had a very strong support system.  We discussed her boyfriend and his loyalty.  I could go on and on about our discussions.
B004EC5IUW|5.0|This item continues the Eva movies with another great installment. Shinji is an annoying character towards the end, but the ending itself sets up for something we all know will be great. A BUY for all anime fans.
1932100660|5.0|I am a 4th year medical student with one week left until graduation.  So, in short, I have finished medical school in the US.  Frankly, I had no clue that this research existed, nor could I have guessed that research would have existed with such ENORMOUS implications in this country.      Simply looking at the message, this book is perhaps the most important thing I have been exposed to in medical school.  Of course, the tough part is whether people (myself included) will care, whether we will listen, and whether we will change.    Based on this book and conversations with other future doctors who are familiar with it and other research, I have changed my diet from a standard Wisconsin dairy heavy, meat intensive diet to essentially a vegan one.  And even after a short while, I have lost weight, feel considerably better, and intuitively feel that I will get even better.    I would encourage anyone who wants to feel good and is able to understand science to read this book.  And if you're not the science type, maybe still try it out :P  (Comment- the book is heavy in the science, but it is written (I think) in a pretty accessible, conversational style)    Post-script (added months later) - my parents decided to try a whole plant based diet after reading Caldwell Esselstyn's \\"Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease\\".  Both feel great, have lost weight in a seemingly very healthy way, and my dad's arthritis is the best it's been in years.  I'm still feeling great, by the way.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|Love this!!! Got this for my son when he was just newborn. I was shopping around for a binkie for him, and when I came upon the Wabbanub's I just fell in love with them. They are just the cutes thing, it's also very good cause it doesn't go flying out, when he's sucking on it. Even as a newborn he started to hold on to it with his arms around it. We love it, we've had so many compliments about it. I'd recommend it to any mom shopping for a binkie.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|More...Much more!  This is the kind of book that you will read in 2 days. You will not be able to put it down. The author pulls you into a world that you will never want to leave and makes you feel right at home. I was so disappointed when the book ended....I just wanted to read on and on and on...The characters come alive and you are there for every moment of this excellent fantasy!  Enjoy!
B004Q1FDHO|5.0|2 thumbs up. I am already addicted to this game. I love the sound effects and the half blown up fish.

B004KKX814|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo2ZFUZCC056RDP]]this is my review of L drago destroy
0425188809|2.0|Koontz can write a compelling novel, but in this one he \\"writes down\\" to the reader.  The major female character is not believable; the romance is corny as the dickens, and the protagonist, Travis Cornell, is not well-developed. The plot is okay, and the monster is pretty monstrous, so I'll give it a 2.
0375826742|4.0|The book Brisingr begins just 4 days after Eldest left off.  The opening chapters focus on Eragon Saphira and Roran attempting to kill the Ra'Zac.  The rest of the book is a whirlwind of action and events.  Ultimately this is a placeholder book, however the story definately advances.  In the book  1)The fate of Sloan the Butcher is revealed . 2)The fate of Roran and Katrina is revealed.  3)Roran's role in the Varden is shown.  4)Arya's past is more thoroughly explored. 5)Eragon learns more about the mysterious spirits and shades. (though they are still somewhat of an enigma.) 6)Eragon's conflict with Az Sweldn Rak Anuin is resolved; althoguh it is possible that more will occur.  7)A new dwarf king is chosen. 8)More is learned about Eragon's parents. (One revelation is particularly suprising.) 9)Eragon learns why Galbatorix and to a lesser extent Murtagh are so unnaturally strong. 10)Solembum's prophecy regarding the weapon under the Menoa Tree is resolved.  11)More is revealed about the forsworn and their dragons.    The primary focus in this book is Eragon fullfilling his oaths and promises from the previous books, as well as accomplishing everything he needs to do before confronting Galbatorix. Eragon spends much time among the Varden and the dwarves.   This book is for the most part a page turner.  In the middle of the book some events drag on slightly.  Some conversations are overdrawn and Paolini could have done a better job being more concise.  In general this book is riveting, although it probably could accomplished just as much in 650 pages instead of 750.  The last fifth of the book are some of the best 150 pages I have ever had the pleasure of reading.  They are chucked full of surprises, revelations, resolutions, and suspense.      The only flaw I have with the story itself is one particular Roran chapter.  In this story Roran is portrayed as an ordinary human without magic, a dragon, or the enhanced strength of elves and the Ra'Zac.  In spite of this Roran still manages to accomplish extraordinary deeds; although they are limited because Paolini knows that Roran only has human ablilities.  In one chapter called Insubordination Roran's accomplishments go beyond impressive, beyond epic, to just plain ridiculous.  To enjoy fantasy one must suspend their disbeleif, however the story must remain beleivable within its own rules.  In my opinion an ordinary man killing 193 men in a single battle is overkill literally and figuratively.  In my opinion Paolini should have had Roran kill around 40 men in this battle.  This is high enough to be imressive and extremely badass but not ludicrous.      Overall I rate this book a 9/10 or 4.5/4 stars.  I hope the fourth and final book is just as engaging.  If you enjoy fantasy, mystery, and epic battles this book is a must read.
B004OKFISQ|3.0|This is going to be the pressing that officially makes me give up audiophile LP re-releases. After carefully comparing this version to the original, which I bought recently for $3.00, I would call it a mixed bag with the nod going to the latter.     At first I thought the acoustic guitars on the new version sounded metallic and digital, but they're that way on the original so it's just how they were recorded. There's more dynamic range on the original which is noticeable on drums, and there's also more transparency in the mids and highs. You can hear overtones from the piano on the original, less so on the re-issue. Electric guitar solos have a mild glare on the new version. Surface noise, pops and clicks are significant on the new LP and I'm not saying all copies are that way, but mine is. Although I understand the limitations of re-mastering from a 30+ year old analog source, I don't understand why at $25 and up, the quality of vinyl is often so poor. There are exceptions, but I'm done rolling the dice at such steep prices.
B002DZX96C|3.0|Your enjoyment of these sonatas depend on how you perceive Beethoven. Beethoven marked the end of the classical period and the beginning of the romantic era. So if you prefer Beethoven the classicist, Brendel's later interpretations (ie this recording) would be right up your alley. He plays with great care and develops his ideas slowly, always treating the sonatas with great delicacy. When I hear his rendition of Beethoven's sonatas, I'm reminded of a lyrical dance.<br /><br />The question though is, are you looking for a lyrical dance in Beethoven?<br /><br />As Beethoven began to descend into deafness, he sought grander themes, seeking out to reach out to the masses. His later compositions were always infused with great power. This, was Beethoven the romantic.<br /><br />My introduction to Beethoven's sonatas was Brendel. But when I first heard Schnabel, my view of Beethoven changed. Always, you can feel the power of Beethoven bursting forth from his piano. Though his playing contained a number of mistakes, there was no mistaking the sheer magnificence of his recording. However, the sound quality of Schabel's traversal leaves a lot to be desired. For the enthusiast though, this would not be an issue.<br /><br />So should you get this recording?<br /><br />It comes down to whether you prefer your Beethoven perfect sound and careful delicacy or filled with power and played without abandon. While people say that Brendel's earlier interpretations might change your mind of Brendel as a Beethoven interpreter (which I have yet to hear), I think I'll stick to Beethoven the romantic.<br /><br />UPDATE: After listening to a number of other renditions of Beethoven's piano sonatas I have to say my favorite interpretation of the sonatas is by Emil Gilels. While he does not cover every sonata what he does cover is played beautifully and with passion.
B004IQMXD4|5.0|Stevie Nicks has done it again.  If you're a fan of Stevie Nicks I'm sure you'll enjoy this album.  Less production than TISL but more than a FM album. Stevie comes through with great lyrics.  Her partnership with Dave Stewart on this album shows harmoniously.
B004Q1FDHO|4.0|Super Dynamite Fishing is a fun game with a light and funny story. There are numerous upgrades available as you complete challenges and buy gifts in order to woo your sweetheart but, unless a certain upgrade is needed to complete a challenge, there is no real reason to divert from regular ol' dynamite.  However, while SDF is fun, it is also very laggy at times, possibly due to the amount of action on screen at any given time, even on a 1Ghz phone. There is a section of the main map that says &quot;Coming Soon&quot;, so hopefully the kinks will get ironed out.  Overall, it's been fun. And now, it's time to light up another stick and get back to fishin'!
B0047Y17P2|1.0|Good book lousy price. I got it from the library and will continue to read all his books that way until they get real with the price.
B003HGKJH8|5.0|Great album and I just want to add one observation. For it to work, though, you have to listen to the first track (It Is Not Meant To Be) on good speakers at adequate volume. Laptop speakers won't suffice.     Lister to the fourth bass note, the highest one in the line. Do you hear the little studio trick? They dial down the volume just right before it picks up again. It doesn't sound like much when I describe it, it is subtle, but in my opinion it adds a lot to the song.    Albums like this that are rich with sonic textures reward repeat listens. And they always deserve proper speakers.    Have fun!    Shores
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Awesome! Fixed my network and made t faster even for a non-tech savy person.  Easy to use.  U just need to adjust ur channels in ur router
B0042RUMEQ|5.0|I got this CD by mistake from a friend of mine (I was actually looking for a Pink CD & he mistook it for Pink Friday). I'm very glad to have it, though. I found the music to be excellent, each & every song. There is a pleasant style to Nicki's way of keeping songs fresh. She changes her voice from time to time, plus she has an edge to her. I also loved the way each song had a unique beat & way about it. The cameos by Eminem & others also helped, but, overall, it was Nicki who has me listening to this CD over & over & over again. Great work, Nicki!!!!!
0312944926|3.0|My book arrived quickly which is always appreciated. I needed a book to read during my trip and plane rides to and from Arizona. This book arrived just in the nick of time! It was an exceptionally fast read, I was able to whip right thru it. But I have to say it was<br />easily my least favorite Dan Brown book. I'm not sure if it's because I had read every other Dan Brown book before picking up<br />Digital Fortress, but I felt as though this was a rushed second release for Brown and he did everything he could<br />to stray from the writing style he used in DaVinci Code (and later the rest of the Robert Langdon series) which is the writing style he is known for and that I love so much. I didn't learn half as much in this book as I did with his other novels and I also noticed he re-used a lot of things in later novels that he used in Digital Fortress. So although it's good and certainly worth reading (especially if you're a Dan Brown fan) it's not up to par with his other works.
0670022411|3.0|This was one of my favorite books of the year. That being said... it appealed to be because I am a science-dork, Anne Rice loving (Witching Hour!), yogi who reads very little besides paranormal fiction. I loved how long the book was. I found it so satisfying to read a book that took a few days to get through. I had no idea that the book was part of a series until I reached the end. Now I'm on the edge of my seat excited for the next installment. The characters were wonderful and developed really nicely. By the end of the novel you have the great feeling of \\"family\\" like you know all of their quirks inside and out (even the cat). The novel was very well written. The book was a bit of Anne Rice's Witching Hour mixed in with a bit of the romance of the Twilight Series. I loved it.
B002VWNICW|5.0|There is not much more to say then, Jane Austen was pure writing Genius! The most beautiful love story ever written. Every love story ever written after 1813 can be compared to this one; they are all some type of replica of Pride and Prejudice.

B004SEVPWQ|3.0|This app has great graphics, but also has a steep learning curve. Be warned, this app is not intuitive whatsoever. Also, the EULA is mind-boggingly stupid.  If either of those are problems for you, skip this app.  If not, once you get past those flaws, the game is great fun and addictive.
B001TODO54|4.0|Brief Notes:    -Stands alone, but there is a prequel set 30 years prior and plans for a sequel, which will take place six years later.  In my opinion though, that's not a \\"series,\\" strictly speaking.    -It has all the YA Fantasy elements (romance! action! an uber-feminist heroine who swears off marriage!), but there has been some controversy with younger YA audiences due to one scene with sexytimes.      And Now With More Substance:    I really loved the beginning 1/3 of this novel.  Katsa, our heroine, is a fierce woman warrior famed throughout the kingdom for her killing prowess.  Her killing is more than just a skill- it's her Grace, a natural super-human skill evidenced by her mismatched blue and green eyes.  However, she is held captive by her uncle, the king of the Midluns, who uses her as a thug to enforce his whims and rules.  In spite of this, Katsa has managed to form an underground society with the help of her cousin, Prince Raffin, and together they help those who need it.    See?  Doesn't that sound awesome?  Wait, it gets better.    On a mission to rescue the father of the Leinid king, Katsa comes across the Leinid Prince Po, another Graced Fighter (who also happens to be on numerous YA \\"book characters I have a crush on\\" lists).  Without expecting or intending to, Katsa finds something she's never had before- a friend.  Together Katsa and Po must find out who authorized the kidnapping of Po's grandfather and what they meant by it.  But can Katsa keep doing her good deeds while breaking arms for her uncle?    ...sadly, that's the first quarter/thirdish part of the book.  The other 300 pages are good, but it loses the premise it promised me.  I grew attached to characters (especially Raffin!) but they disappear after the first third of the novel.  That, ultimately, is why I gave the book a 7 instead of a 9.  I liked the direction it went in, and I enjoyed the book, but I feel like it promised me a caramel apple and gave me cotton candy.  I like cottoncandy... but... but you promised me a caramel apple.  Oh well.  At least you, Dear Reader, have been warned.    There's also one stretch of the novel that suffers a bit from \\"Endless Camping Trip\\" syndrome a la Harry Potter 7 (I mean,  Rowling's general genius makes up for most flaws, but that camping  trip took forever). The Camping Trip syndrome isn't full-blown in this novel, but there is one point that I feel maybe didn't move the story along as well or as quickly as it could have.
B004G600A4|5.0|I ordered this for my daughter for an Easter present from her Nani.  I was afraid that it wouldn't get to us in time but by using the Prime Membership trial, it made it in no time without the additional rush fee.  I was very impressed with the delivery and my daughter LOVES the movie (as well as the entire family).
B004G5ZXVQ|5.0|This album combines all the best experimental elements that preceded it -- from \\"Monster\\" on forward -- and creates a new, cohesive, yet instantly recognizable sound.    This is NOT an album of R.E.M. attempting to re-hash or re-invent; nor does it represent a return to form.  This is an album that marks a re-arrival.
0143117564|2.0|This book was really disappointing.  I'm a fan of mystery noir, but this novel had so many flaws!  I admit, Pynchon has great writing style.  He also has some hilarious bits.  So for the first chapter, I thought this book might be great.  But he has absolutely no characterization, no morality, no substance, no depth.  The plot wanders around nonsensically and was very difficult to follow.  The main character, Doc, is shallow and undeveloped.  Much of the time, Doc is stoned or on an acid trip; it feels like the author was in a similarly altered state when writing this book.
B00338QENI|5.0|I usually steer very clear of non-fiction books, however this one intrigued me.  It was definitley well worth it.  What an interesting story that needs to be shared.  This book is very well written, I came to truly care about the family and what they and Henrietta went through.  I purchased the Kindle version and sadly the photos did not translate well (in fact many were missing), I realized this while at the bookstore & I thumbed through the paperback.  I will most assuredly recommend to all my friends.
B004A8ZWT2|3.0|Two great actors, but a very weak and predictable plot. Some of the boat chase scenes were obviously blue screened with background added later. Hey, if the hair does not move, you cannot be racing through Venice's canals. Come on!
B00005NKKZ|4.0|The last of the Simon and Garfunkel albums reflects the times - going from the optimism of the 60's to the more reactionary days of the 70's.  The title cut is a powerful and moving song.  Other songs you might know include \\"The Boxer\\" and \\"Cecilia.\\"  A generation has grown up not hearing this music (either when it was released or from their parents) and the times the music reflect have passed into history.  But a lot of this album will fit well in any time, and it deserves to be discovered again and again.
B004FOA84A|2.0|I just didn't like this game. Ran well on my Samsung Galaxy Tab and Vibrant. You owners of weak phones... GET BETTER PHONES!  Game is boring and too short. Glad I got it for free or I'd been mad if I paid for this product. Good try devs but meh from my POV. Sorry. Oh, and look... Damazon brought the word count down to 20. Smh. One word for this game... NO.
B004XDYJRU|3.0|Love the options it gives (all the station, recording, ect)  Even with decent data coverage, station comes in w/o any problems. The one issue I have with it is it KILLES my battery.  Not only when its unplugged, but also when I had the phone connected to the computer to charge it was draining faster than it could charge. I even killed any other app that might have been aiding in draining the battery, but alas I had to fully shut down the phone for it to charge properly.  If issue were ever to be fixed, I would give it a 5 star rating, but for now, 3 it is.

This device is comfortable and well worth the price.
0061726826|3.0|This book is everywhere right now, and I read a lot of positive reviews online prior to reading it. To Oliver's credit, her detailed writing adds to the story, although during some action scenes, I felt distracted by overly descriptive narrative. I enjoyed the clever chapter intros from the various books and teachings that contribute to the world in Delirium. That helped add to the world structure.    My biggest issue with Delirium is that I had trouble imagining this world could exist. I wondered what kept people from questioning the medical procedures. Why didn't more people fight back? In our current age, the debate is so fierce about how involved a government should be in controlling our decisions and limiting freedom. I wanted to hear how the society ended up this way. Perhaps this is explored more in the upcoming second book.     The theme felt familiar to Orwell's \\"1984,\\" but there are enough differences to keep this fresh for new readers given the teenage twist. If you like the idea of more modern take on Big Brother society, with a dash of teen angst and romance, then this may be a good choice for you.

B004IQMXD4|5.0|Stevie Nicks is my favorite artist, but the last couple albums have been a bit disappointing. They lacked the edge and catchy nature of my favorites like Wild Hart and Bella Donna. Well in this album, the magic is back. It has much more grit and power than her more recent work. The emotion is there, the hooks are there and the poetic lyrics. It makes for a fantastic collection. The music feels familiar without being too derivative of her earlier work. I'll be listening to this one for a long time to come!

1439153663|5.0|I could not put this book down for a minute and fell totally in love with the story line of the young white girl, Lavinia who is brought to the Captains home after her parents both die on his ship on there way to America from Ireland.  She is put in the kitchen house with the slaves who cook for the Tall Oaks plantation owner, the Captain and his wife Martha and their two children.  The story that unfolds is heart wrenching.  Such an amazing story.  Guaranteed to never let you down for one second.  If you enjoy history during the slavery of southern Virginia, you'll love this story. It is what real family is all about.  A beautiful story with such believable characters!
B0020H46OC|4.0|When Method Man and Redman first collaborated on the classic weed anthem \\"How High\\" in 1995, there was an unmistakable chemistry between the two. After a couple of appearances on each other's albums in the late 90's, people were demanding a full record from them. The end result was their debut album as a duo- 1999's \\"Blackout!\\". The album was rather successful and cemented them as the heir apparent to another marijuana centered duo Cheech & Chong. Two years later, they filmed the stoner comedy \\"How High\\", which was directed by Bob Dylan's son Jesse Dylan (\\"American Wedding\\", \\"Kicking And Screaming\\"). After that film, they returned to their day jobs as both solo artists as well as members of groups- Method Man from Wu-Tang Clan and Redman from Def Squad. A decade would pass before anyone heard anything from the duo until 2009, when Method Man and Redman would release the long awaited follow up sophomore album \\"Blackout! 2\\".<br /><br />On this new album, there are the returns of producers from the first album. Erick Sermon produces the songs \\"Dangerus MCees\\" and \\"Neva Herd Dis B4\\", while Rockwilder handles \\"Hey Zulu\\" and \\"A Lil' Bit\\". Pete Rock produces the first single \\"A Yo\\", while Havoc of the group Mobb Deep gets behind the boards on \\"I'm Dope\\"- a track in which the duo compares their music to a drug addiction. They duet with Raekwon and Ghostface Killah on \\"Four Minutes To Lock Down\\", Keith Murray on \\"Errbody Scream\\" and Bun B on \\"City Lights\\". They get surprisingly romantic on the melodic \\"Mrs. International\\", in which they seduce a non-American woman. Lastly, a Method Man and Redman album wouldn't be complete without a weed anthem, and in this case it's the track \\"Dis Iz 4 All My Smokers\\". While Method Man and Redman show that they haven't lost their sense of humor, this album is good but suffers from weak production on a few songs. Much of that having to do with them trying to keep up with the times- something they really didn't need to do. For the most part, \\"Blackout! 2\\" is listenable, but seems to cater to the pop crowd as opposed to the hip hop crowd on a few occasions. Still in all, it's nice to have them back after a long hiatus.ut! 2\\" is listenable, but seems to cater to the pop crowd as opposed to the hip hop crowd on a few occasions.

B0046HA25Q|5.0|I waited for several weeks for these runners as I had damaged my achilles and my old runners had worn out. I wasn't disappointed, when I received them i went out for a run and knocked 10 seconds from my best 2.4km time. The shoes transition from heel to toe is something to be experienced. I found them a joy to wear, but I guess a few more miles will tell a better story, but at the moment I am very happy.
B004IQMXD4|5.0|Nicks' collaboration with Dave Stewart (of Eurythmics fame) has channeled her creative being in its truest form. Fans will not be disappointed and those being introduced to Stevie for the first time will be truly amazed. There is something for everyone in this collection of songs: love, salvation, dreams, passion, magic, literature, war, the human condition, history, freedom... For me, as songs are so personal, the \\"stand back\\" tracks: WIDE SARGASSO SEA / MOONLIGHT / ANNABEL LEE / EVERYBODY LOVES YOU / ITALIAN SUMMER. Spread the word and support this great piece of work. BUY THE MUSIC as it supports all involved who toiled extremely hard to deliver such a fantastic gift. Thank you, Stevie et al.
B004LL1HM4|5.0|It seems to me like most bands either try to change too much with their second album, and in the process lose their sound, or they just rehash the first album and reveal themselves as one-trick ponies. Fleet Foxes do neither of these things. This album is different, but not too different. Lyrically, the focus has changed from interpersonal relationships and family to introspection and society...so their moving inward and outward at the same time. These guys are all improving as musicians. This material is more complex and the performances are closer to perfect. The singing and drums are especially tight. Overall, it's what you'd expect if you've been listening to these guys for a few years, and if you've enjoyed their other stuff than you will probably like this. My only complaint is that some of the arrangements may be too complex and the soundscape becomes too saturated at times. That's not enough to keep me from giving it a 5-star rating though. Enjoy!

B003R4ZMO0|5.0|The 2010 Hawaii 5-0 television series has become the #1 show in my house.  No phone calls,visits or even extraneous talking are allowed during the airing of H5-0! Family members have learned these rules the hard way! Have to honestly say this is the first network television production that I have faithfully followed in many, many years.  The actors are stellar in their performances, the writers are spot on, the characterizations are great.  The only minor flaw could be considered the weekly crime procedural.  Occasionally I find myself so wrapped up in what is happening between the characters, that I forget there is a crime to solve! Over the top? Of course! Fun to watch? Absolutely! The DVD set a \\"must have\\"?  YES!! Can't wait for the Blue Ray set!
B004Q1FDHO|4.0|Initially the game seems painfully simple but once you complete the first level there are a number of game elements revealed including various upgrades for fishing spots, home, boats, weapons, etc., which gives the game significantly more playability.  Tilt controls are a little wonky and runs slow on Samsung Moment (Which is admittedly getting to be an old phone).
B004FOA84A|3.0|If you like point-and-click adventure games, this may be your cup of tea. The visuals are quite good as well. However the game is not terribly challenging and it can be completed over lunch. There just isn't much content here. The most puzzling thing about this game is why the 16MB app doesn't support moving to SD.  Speaking of support, I encountered much trouble getting this game to run. I originally purchased this game for my Tegra 2 powered Viewsonic gTablet (Froyo, 1.2-4349 stock for those interested), but could not get it to run. The app would simply force close on launch, even after a full reboot and a reinstall. The same thing happened with an ASUS TF-101 (Honeycomb), another Tegra 2 device. It did install and run without a hitch on a Dell Streak (Froyo) which incidentally uses a Qualcomm QSD 8250. After reading reports of issues on the Atrix, also Tegra 2, I am inclined to believe that Nvidia's SoC is not supported. If your Android device uses Tegra 2, I would advise caution before purchasing this app until an update is released that explicitly addresses this issue.  UPDATE 11/17/2011: An update released over the summer has fixed the noted compatibility issues. Score adjusted from 2 stars to 3. Low replay value and short gameplay dictate the score.  Compatibility: Works on Dell Streak. Force closes at start on gTablet and TF-101  Tested Devices (Device - OS version - Chipset):   Nexus One - 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3.3 - Qualcomm SnapDragon 8250   Dell Streak 5 - 1.6 and 2.2 - Qualcomm SnapDragon 8250   Viewsonic gTablet - 2.2 with stock 1.2-4349 and 2.2 with Enhancement Pack - Nvidia Tegra 2   Asus TF-101 - 3.0.1 and 3.2.1 - Nvidia Tegra 2  Samsung Galaxy S II - 2.3.4 - Exynos 4210  Amazon Kindle Fire - Custom 2.3 - OMAP 4430
B004KSQN7C|1.0|If I could give this a 0 rating I would. I read the reviews and couldn't wait to buy it and listen to it. I listened to every second of the entire cd. Seemed like five hours. I literally was wondering if it would ever be over. This cd is soooo overprocessed that you can't even tell that it's Britany Spears singing. There is not one single song that I have any desire to hear again.
B004UC1WN8|5.0|Jennifer Lopez is back! with an all new album, \\"LOVE?\\". I liked JLO and some of her singles but I never been a fan of hers until now. LOVE? is just an awesome album with great producers like RedOne, Lady Gaga, Tricky Stewart, The-Dream, and StarGate. This album is for everyone specially if you like to dance or like upbeat songs. It's rare that I buy an album and just like some songs but this album every song is worth of hearing. Songs that didn't make it to the final album are \\"Louboutins\\", \\"Fresh Out the Oven\\", \\"Greatest Part of Me\\", \\"Hooked on You\\", \\"Whipping My Hair\\", and \\"Story of My Life\\" because some songs didn't fit with the album sounds/theme. \\"LOVE?\\" is one of the best album of 2011 so far it's up there with Britney Spears \\"Femme Fatale\\" and Nicole Scherzinger \\"Killer Love\\". Really recommend \\"LOVE?\\" specially the Deluxe Edition with 5 Bonus Track and a 2-sided poster.

0756404738|4.0|The second installment of the Kingkiller Chronicles is both beautifully written and highly entertaining.  It's not a traditional epic fantasy in the style of Lord of the Rings or the Wheel of Time.  There are no huge clashes between nations and no great battles--yet.  The Wise Man's Fear is a more intimate story, the story of a living legend who is patiently waiting to die.      The book isn't perfect, obviously.  It does have some flaws, which I will discuss below.  Even so, I had a hard time deciding whether to give it 4 or 5 stars.  I settled on 4, because Rothfuss seems to be a naturally gifted story-teller and I expect his books will get even better as he continues to write them.  I wanted to have somewhere to go with my ratings.         Premise:  Kvothe, the humble barkeep in a backwoods town, continues telling the story of his extraordinary life to a historian.  The story-within-the-story begins at the University, follows a lengthy journey across the sea, overland through a vast forest, and then back to the University.  As Kvothe continues to gain new skills, knowledge and power, we are occasionally brought back into the present time-line for short interludes at the inn.  The contrast between Kvothe-the-growing-legend and Kvothe-the-humble-innkeeper becomes sharper as the book concludes, leaving the reader with a lot of unanswered questions.      Prose:  Rothfuss's prose is effortless.  It moves you fluidly through the story, rarely calling attention to itself except when he wants it to.  For example, there are many moving passages where Kvothe describes his music and what it means to him.  As a musician, I found this theme be be very close to my heart, and obviously it is to Rothfuss, as well.  The style very much suits Kvothe's character--although he is a skilled storyteller, he doesn't particularly enjoy wordplay for its own sake.      Characterization:  Since most of the book is told in first-person point-of-view, I'll focus on Kvothe, the narrator.  Throughout most of the book I was very much in sympathy with him.  Because he is unusually gifted (and knows it), in the hands of a less skilled storyteller, his character could easily become too obnoxious to read about.  But for the most part Rothfuss balances this out.  His awkwardness and confusion about women, for example, is completely believable for a teenage boy, and from my perspective it does a lot to humanize his character.  However, this brings me to my biggest criticism of the book.      At one point, Kvothe abruptly loses his sexual innocence, and with it, all semblance of humility.  Suddenly he is a master of seduction.  At sixteen.  I don't care if he was schooled by Aphrodite herself--the change in his character is so sudden, so jarring, that I literally had to grit my teeth and say, \\"Oh, puh-leaze.\\"  It was as though the careful balance Rothfuss had been maintaining to keep me liking his character was suddenly stripped away and I was plunged into some adolescent male fantasy.      But I kept reading, because overall the book was very, very good.  Fortunately Kvothe regained my sympathy soon afterward in a lengthy section during which he is repeatedly humbled by a ten-year-old girl, followed by another section where he kills some people who definitely deserve it.  Is this manipulative on the part of the author?  Perhaps.  But that's what storytelling is, and Rothfuss is skilled enough at it that for the most part, I can admire it rather than resent it.      I felt the secondary characters--Wil, Sim, Fela, etc., were better developed in this book.  Part of the challenge of this story was that none of the secondary characters were with Kvothe for the entire journey, so they had a sort of transitory importance.  From a writer's point of view, you want to make those characters interesting enough for the reader to want to read about for awhile, but not so fascinating that they'll be overly disappointed when the narrator inevitably leaves them behind.  I thinkRothfuss does an excellent job of balancing this.    Denna intrigues me more, as well.  But I'm still not sure if her character is genuinely interesting or if she just seems that way, because she's a bit of a mystery.      Plot and Pacing:  While lots of interesting things happen in this book, I don't really feel like I'm any closer to the bigger truths Kvothe is seeking.  I'd hoped to learn more about the Chandrian in this book, or why Kvothe is waiting to die.  In general, though, the story is very entertaining in its own right.  The first hundred pages or so deal extensively with Kvothe's money problems, which I understand bothered some people who read The Name of the Wind.  But the story builds and gathers momentum very nicely, up until Kvothe leaves the Maer's court.  At that point I felt the pace stalled a bit, but even at its slowest points the book still kept me turning pages.  Rothfuss is very good at knowing when to dramatize scenes and how to smoothly compress blocks of relatively uneventful time.        My biggest criticism of the plot was that I really felt like the time in the Maer's court was leading up to some big discovery, but it never did.  I also wondered why, after gaining the Maer's favor, he sent Kvothe to a \\"hole in the map\\" to hunt down bandits.  The question was posed, but never answered.  Then there is the obvious loose end of the Lackless box, which gives me some hope that at least some of these questions will be revisited in future installments.  It's difficult to judge the plot of a single book in a series when you haven't read the whole series yet, but at least there was some closure to this volume.  Kvothe returns to the University, financially well-off for the first time in his life, thus bringing him full-circle.      Setting:  Rothfuss does an excellent job immersing you in his world without resorting to endless blocks of description and static detail.  You learn about the setting from Kvothe's interaction with it.  That is how itshould be done, in my opinion--a lot of fantasy authors would do well to take heed of this.
B0041KKYEM|4.0|Not a movie for anyone who can't handle a touch of horror.  My wife had to turn her head several times.  I enjoyed it for the most part, but felt there were some scenes that were unnecessary.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|still no may upload for new game. supposed to be may 2011 for start of new episode/location. still no update available. what is the delay?
B004DK5CW4|5.0|It's hard to find a movie I enjoy equally as well with my grand daughter, but this is one. This is an adult movie that kids will like, rather than the other way around.
B00122J0YW|4.0|I truly like this album very much as well as her first album.<br />Such classics like \\"Papa Don't Preach\\", \\"Where's The Party\\", \\"La Isla Bonita\\", \\"True Blue\\", and \\"Live To Tell\\" are really good.  I'd just purchased this album on cassette in late 1998 and enjoyed listening to it, but beware of such newer editions!  After I bought this MP3 album and listened to it, the original LP version of \\"Papa Don't Preach\\" was replaced with the remix version.  That is why I place four stars instead of four and a half.  You'll also notice on some other albums by other artists that are newly remixed and remastered in the 2000s are somewhat altered, thus no longer originals compared to records, cassettes, and CDs that came out before early-mid 2000s.  Be sure you do your research before buying either a CD or an MP3 album; it'll save you trouble.  Otherwise buy older CDs.
B004K4IZ3G|5.0|This movie was absolutely amazing.  The visual eye candy and music composed by Daft Punk was incredible.  I purchased the non-3D version because I could care less.  I really enjoyed everything this movie had to offer!
0761158820|5.0|I bought this for my almost four year old thinking the picture would make him laugh or inspire his drawing. I never thought we would have a 40+ monster collection going that battle, raid, and have epic battles with rainbow, playmobil knights, and play dough cans.     Truly, I never ever want to see the words \\"insert tab 478\\" again. I never thought I would agree to one-monster-a-day as a limit for each fully functional adult in our household. The instructions are clear, the colors vivid, the craft is entertaining, and he has loved, loved, loved this book. Finally, this is really quite accessible and portable. All you need is a glue stick (we used elmer school glue stick) and some time. No printing, etc, and the paper is ridged for easy folds. Very well designed.    We are a pretty gentle family (no media, no scary stuff) and although some of the monsters are kind of scary, it hasn't scared him.    I don't think I've ever spent so little for some much ongoing entertainment value.
B004BLTNM0|5.0|This is a movie that has grown on me over time. Hated it after the first viewing, but something about it made me want to try it again and have loved it ever since. It has one of the most brutal rape scenes in cinema history and what she does to one guy when she is out for revenge (in the tub) is horrifying. That tub is scene still sticks out to me as one of the most disturing things I have seen in a movie. Being a guy probably has something to do with it too. Overall, a disturbing film that won't be everyone's cup of tea, but still one worth checking out at least once.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|I purchased these for my 11 year old son after he broke 2 cheapy headsets. The sound in these are amazing!! He uses them when he plays call of duty-black ops. These are very high quality! Don't skimp out and by the cheaper ones! You'll regret it!
0061537969|5.0|Other reviewers were not dog people,m yet they loved the book. Some were not car or sports people, and they still loved the book. I am both an animal lover (I don't have a dog because I wouldn't be able to say goodbye to him when his time came, but I lived with a cat that was almost dog-like in his dedication to me), and a failed race car driver. So at the ripe age of 50, I race cars online on high end simulators.     Some of our simulators mimic rain very well. It's just as hard and just as tricky to race in the rain on a computer simulator as it is on track. Maybe worse, since your \\"oneness\\" with your car is only through your steering wheel. You have to imagine the G forces and the slip through your wheel slight movements or lack of resistance. Many real race car drivers at first are not very fast on simulators. They miss much of what makes them good and in control of their car.    I picked up the book after a rainy race at Spa Francochamps (the virtual one, not the real one) thinking it may be a manual on how to race cars in the rain. Something I discovered I was not very good at.  But the jacket said it was a story narrated by a dog. A novel. Not a manual on how to race cars, even virtual ones. Yet as it turned out, it was a manual.    The book sat in my kindle for a while after I bought it. Things to do, places to go. But finally I had enough time to start it and finish it in one sitting. The only way I read books. I am a fast reader.  Now, I have to say that I am a skeptic. One of those people that will ask you for proof when you talk about reincarnation, UFOs, life after death. So it may seem that the entire premise of the book, that dogs reincarnate into humans when they are ready, would be of little interest to me. But even skeptics like a good story, and this is a wonderful story.     The racing scenes and the tips on how to drive a racecar, in all weather, are few and brief, but they are powerful and memorable. I'll never drive again in the rain without taking to heart some of the quotes from the book.     So, whether you are a dog lover or not, a race car driver or not, whether you even like motorsports at all, I think there is something for everyone in this book. From Enzo wise counsel, to his master's single minded focus on fighting for his rights. This is one of those books you wish it could be made into a major motion picture, maybe narrated by Richard Dreyfuss. One of those books that is bound to make an impression on you.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I have never read him before, but I loved this book.  I am half way through the second in the series and it continues on strong.  It is definately a book that takes awhile to get into and know the characters, but is well worth the wait.  Yes, it has blood and young marriages and incest to keep the bloodlines, but that is how it was at that time.  HBO series seems to follow the story, cant say more without spoilers.  Well done.
B000UZ4CWW|5.0|A true return to form.  While the Bostaph years had Slayer becoming more precise, Lombardo's return brings with it that off-kilter thrashy-sloppiness... which is a really good thing.  Great songs here! From the opener Flesh Storm to Skeleton Christ, Cult and Jihad, Slayer really brings it.  Lyrically, the album is tightly focused on religion's role in war and violence.  Released at the height of the War on Terror, Slayer examine the causes of the conflicts and bring into question the motives behind the religious fundamentalists.<br />The original pressing of Christ Illusion features artwork by Larry Carroll, the artist responsible for Slayer's unholy trinity (Reign in Blood, South of Heaven, Seasons in the Abyss).  I love his artwork and was thrilled to see him grace a Slayer album again.  Unfortunately, when the album was repressed with the bonus song 'Final Six' (incredible track), a new cover was issued.  This new cover features a really lame image of what appears to be Christ's hand with a hole through it. It's really a shame to see such a wonderfully shocking image replaced with such mediocrity.<br /><br />Better than World Painted Blood, Christ Illusion has become perhaps my favorite Slayer album. Yes, I like it as much as Reign in Blood.  I'll take the heat for that, it's an incredible album.  If you like Slayer, if you like what they stand for (and against), you'll dig Christ Illusion.
1556438850|1.0|I am a fairly new hatha yoga teacher and was looking forward to this book. Not so many are out there for the teachers. What a disappointment! I did not learn anything new. The total impression it left me with is that the author is trying to show off without much consideration for the public. I seriously do not know who this book is for, especially the asana section: gymnasts? \\"yoga competitors\\"? Not for grass roots teachers working in the trenches to spread around the goodness of hatha yoga. It's boring and useless. Back it goes! Bye-bye!
1416596585|4.0|Levy provides an entertaining/interesting narrative about Google and its founders from the beginning up through early 2011.  The author is a fan of Google and its major achievements in search and online advertising.  This a timely work about an important tech juggernaut that has a big presence in three of the four key technology trends of the moment: search, video, and mobile (but not social).  The book catches Google in mid-stride.  It will be interesting to see if Google can overcome its size to continue pushing the forefront of change on numerous data analytic capabilities.

B0025UHKNS|4.0|A bit of a learning curve but once past that this is a great GPS watch. It does everything it claims to do, and the more I use it the more functionality I discover. The bezel is very sensitive so a deft touch helps when using it, but experience and the ability to lock the bezel helps. A longer battery life would be nice, but this is not a deal breaker as you just need to remind yourself to charge it every few days. The only real complaint I have is the watch will quite often not auto download workout information to my PC without some intervention. But, overall a great purchase and I would recommend the 405CX Forerunner to anyone.
B0034G4ORC|5.0|The Director combines \\"blackhawk down\\" with alien movies ( independence day, cloverfield and signs come to mind) very well, creating a highly entertaining movie that should satisfy most people. Also, for a change, we (the ever-stupid and helpless human beings) can fight back and defeat the invasion. Nowaday sci-fi movies tend to \\"suprise\\" audience with sad and defeating endinds. They think it makes them look smart. Well, think again! I don,t enjoy for a moment the way we were herded around like cattles. I like it when earthlings can and will kick some serious alien butts!
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|The continuing saga of SAMCRO. An incredible ensemble cast that gets fleshed out further during season 2.  Ron Perleman, Charlie Hunnam, Katey Sagal, and cast take you deeper into the inner workings of the Sons and the sacrifices they must make for the club. Relationships and loyalties are tested.  This is one of the best acted series on television and if you haven't checked it out yet... do it! You'll get hooked.
0385341679|5.0|Took me awhile to process before i reviewed this one, but I'll summarize although this whole book is one big spoiler if you havent read the rest of the series....<br /><br />It's too much:<br /><br />There is so much to this book, so many twists and turns that now, months later on my second read, I cannot begin to even think of how to summarize it, much less do it without spoilers!<br /><br />Suffice to say you'll find out who the beast is, a bit of who Barrons is (altho not everything was answered on his end), who Mac's sister's Killer was, how the Mackeltar's play into the fever plot, what V'Lane's true stake in all this is and... who Mac truly is as well.<br /><br />Many ups and downs in this book- I bit my nails up to Chapter 8 when I groaned, releasing a breath I was unaware of holding, I geared myself up to be thoroughly pissed off if Moning continued on the path I saw her going down - until she quite suddenly veered left much to my astonishment- then wanted to slam the book down in frustration at Mac and Barrons's antics toward each other, once again. But, helpless, I kept reading until the end.<br /><br />What a rush and what a ride. Although there were bits that were eye rolling- especially all the inner dialoguing Mac was doing AND the conclusion felt borrowed on certain aspects sad to say, still- I loved it.<br /><br />5 out of 5.<br /><br />`nuff said

B0018BF1LS|5.0|These cds sound sound a little sterile, dry and wooden, no echo sounds, no power in the songs. It almost sounds like instruments were faded out for this JA music to have a dry, sterile, wooden sound. Songs on CDs are not numbered correctly or numbered at all, one album is a live album which has nothing notable on it music-wise. How can a psychedelic band sound so bad live? Did it sound this bad when it was put on vinal 40+ years ago. The Southern delta blues songs should have been expunged as they are redundant, out of place and a dime a dozen. JA songs on Youtube sound better than this coolection. Signe Anderson proves Grace Slick gave this band all the renown it received.<br /><br />You will not find Grace-led or Grace-dominated song on here that is bad. Everthing she sings is good. This 5 cd set is more than enough proof Grace Slick was the one who made this band stand out. I love what I call the Pan nature-god songs and druggie songs and psychedelics songs which are great but the blues songs are SO redundant and boring and have been done by so many 60s rockers devoid of original ideas that I want to escape from them.<br /><br />This set has a nice cardboard box and no junky plastic that breaks when you open it and each cd has its own paper sleeve which should have had all the songs listed on these individual sleeves but it does not.<br /><br />I bought this simply because 2400 Fulton St. was not available as a new CD sold at a reasonable price.<br /><br />I only had JA greatest hits collections the past 30 year and never looked further into their music but found out there were some other good song (most by Grace)that I never heard before but this band should have ditched some of the Southern Blues songs and did more experimental jam sessions.<br /><br />There is an experimental song after \\"White Rabbit\\" on Surrealistic Pillow that is a classic example of the great sound this band had and what they should have made more of. I wish there could have been more experimental songs like this made by this band back in the 1960s. The child-like and pigs noises should have been omitted by a producers back in the 1960s.<br /><br />It almost seems like someone messed around with these songs and made the voice, bass and drums more prominent and they diminished the other sounds.<br /><br />This  set is a good value for its price and I enjoy listening to it but could do without the vocal antics of some members of the band and they needed to take the making of music more seriously.<br /><br />And do not forget these cds will fall out onto the cement when you get out of your car so put them in a plastic bin and then carry them out of your car. I like cardboard cd cases but the paper inserts  should have had all the songs listed in consecutive order.imental songs like this made by this band back in the 1960s.

1600108512|2.0|Was looking to buy a collector's type edition of this classic novel; I collect hardcovers. Be WARNED this book is the GRAPHIC NOVEL adaptation of the original fantasy story masterpiece. It is very hard to see that in the product description. I gave this version to my teenaged sister who appreciates such things. I had to order the paperback in order to get the novel I was looking for originally.
1591843162|5.0|I've just finished Linchpin and I'm very upset.  If one of Seth Godin's goals was to make me so uncomfortable that I could NOT just read it and ignore it like so many other books, he's succeeded.      If I had an unvoiced expectation when I got the book that I might find a map to doing my art, I might have been disappointed - except that he did something much better than that would have been.     If his art is to help us deal with what is, instead of stewing in what isn't, it works.  My thanks to Seth Godin.     If you're looking for a book to make you comfortable in your complacency, and validate why you don't need to do the work you're meant to, you won't like this one.  Linchpin is the most personally challenging, provocative and powerful book I've read in ages!  Well done!
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Everyone has said it above.  It's ridiculous they can't release the originals we saw in the theatre.  I was 6 years old when I saw Star Wars and I still clearly remember the Stormtroopers breaking down the door in the opening scene.  What a memory.   George you suck.
B004Q1FDHO|5.0|Simple fun. Easy to play on any size screen with a lot to accomplish. I would definitely buy it for the dollar it costs.
0670022411|5.0|I read this book because I admit it, I love vamps and other paranormal beings.   I liked the Twilight Saga with reservations,  I love the Black Dagger Brotherhood. I like good vampires not evil ones and sexy vampires, no Nesferatu or Bela Lugosi for me.  I also like to see the interaction with humans and   I like romance, and difficult romance is even better.  This book adds in two more entities witches and demons. The characters are interesting and intelligent.  I wish vamps were not so controlling, but I understand why they are. I think this is a good balance of romance and paranormal. I am waiting for the sequel.  I listened to this book but it made me want to read it too. The narrator is terrific with the many characters, but her director really needs to pay attention to her pronunciation, she got some words wrong that are not that difficult. But that is a small complaint for this very good book.
1439102813|3.0|A good novel, but not compelling. I learned alot about Alzheimer's disease while reading this book. Luckily, I understood many of those medical terms only because of nursing school. I imagine someone that is not in the medical field would probably have a difficult time with it. I was wishing that the author would have focused more on \\"fiction\\" and the storyline rather than the scientific part of it, but I guess with her background science is her expertise. After reading this book I have a couple of unanswered questions like..Why did John and Alice ride through the cemetery on that snowy day? Was John wanting her to choose a plot to be buried? Why was John so determined to move to New York? In one part of the story John's grown children were begging him to stay and John said, \\"I haven't come to a final decision yet, and the two of you aren't going to bully me into one. You know don't everything.\\" Well, this left me curious and I kept waiting for John to reveal something important that the his children did not know, but he never did. One of the good parts of the story that I liked was the way Alice and Lydia(her daughter) became closer as the story went on. I began to like all of the characters but, John was my least favorite. He seemd a bit insensitive but maybe this is how some family members become when a loved one has Alzheimer's disease.
B004IQMXD4|5.0|Wow, I wasn't expecting this....  \\"In Your Dreams\\" allows Nicks to showcase all of her strengths.  The production is beautiful. Her voice is in terrific form and her writing abilities are at their finest.  \\"For What It Is Worth\\" is stunning. It's simplicity is heartbreaking...it's a reminder how Ms Nicks can twist her harmonies around a melody.  \\"Italian Summer\\" builds to a breath-taking crecendo.  Everyone will find something to enjoy on this cd.  \\"Moonlight\\" is bewitching and brings Nicks back to her Rhiannon hey day.  She rediscovers her rock and roll roots with \\"Ghosts are Gone\\" and the title track. She even explores a more bluesy, soulful sound on \\"You May Be The One\\".   Mick Fleetwood and Lindsey Buckingham make appearances but it is Stevie and Dave Stewart, her producer, that are the real the stars.  While other producers have struggled, Stewart captures Stevie's essence and strips her music to a more pure state. He was able to give her songs shape and form without over producing the cd. Sit back and listen to a 63yo rock & roll legend at her best.
B004IB0N0E|5.0|Giving this 5 stars, not because it's particularly ground-breaking, but it's a consistently good listen beginning to end. The kind of album where every new song you'll find yourself nodding along. Nothing weak here, just consistent, well executed song-writing.
B003L77GRO|2.0|I've watched all of Dexter and a bit surprised how people think this season is great. I honestly feel it's the worst season so far. Maybe developments here and there are great but the thing about Dexter is the main person who is the killer. Nothing can top Lithgow from season 4 and then also his brother in Season 1. But this killer sequence was not good at all. Nothing shocking at all when there were opportunities to really break new ground.
B001FB4W0W|2.0|I loved the books.  I was stunned at how the HBO show is so sexually graphic.  I went back and checked the books and there is some sex but that isn't the focus of the story.  There is so much more sex in the show.  It is unnecessary for the story.  I wish the story line was followed more closely.
0307593525|5.0|Like many others, I ordered this set after seeing \\"Julie and Julia\\".<br />But, this is not a superficial gimmick.<br />There's a reason it's a classic.<br />We love to cook and we have an extensive cookbook selection.<br />We reach for these books time after time.<br />The directions are clear and comprehensive.<br />The recipe options are mouth-watering.<br />The preparation is generally simple (but complicated can be fun too).<br />We have made quiche, chicken, potato, mushroom, dessert and of course, Beef Bourginon.<br />All are fantastic.<br />I have also spent time learning about Julia Child's life.<br />She was a perfectionist with an approachable personality.<br />Her recipes are a reflection of this.
0756404738|1.0|ok - first thing let me just say that I'm only 1/2 way through this book, but I'm writing this review because I'm not at all sure I'm going to bother to read the rest of it.    I am bitterly disappointed by Wise Man's Fear. I really thought Name of the Wind was one of the better fantasy books I've come across in my adult life, and I was eagerly awaiting (and awaiting and awaiting) this 2nd installment in what I really thought was going to be a great series.     instead Rothfuss seems to have channelled the worst parts of J.K. Rowling and delivered \\"Harry Potter Goes to College\\".    lots of inane monologue and dialogue about exams and classes and homework and Alchemy and pranks and girls and blah blah blah blah.     'Sim liked girls but was hopeless at talking to them'   'Denna's eyes glittered...'  'Oh no! Ambrose dosed me with Alchemical Ecstasy!'    who f*@#ing cares?!? I sure don't...    who are the Chandrian? why do they kill people who talk about them? how does magic really work? why does Kvothe get kicked out of Uni?    I'm 500 pages into WMF and I'm itching for Qvothe to finally grow a pair and get laid and do some real magic and piss off some demons and maybe kill someone - ANYONE.     I don't know what happened to Rothfuss between books 1 and 2, but whatever it was, it wasn't good.     it's seems to be all to common these days for potentially great fantasy series to start out strong and then just go off the rails.    Robert Jordan anyone??  George RR Martin??  J.K. Rowling??*    maybe there was a reason Tolkien wrote a TRILOGY... you think??    oh well, a lot can happen in the next 5 years so maybe by the time I'm 50 or so the 3rd book in the series will come out and actually be as good as it should be.     I just can't recommend buying this one.       * ok - so \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" was not exactly 'great' for me (i'm a little old for it) - but Rowling definitely started out strong and about 1/2 way through the series started losing steam. the last 2 or 3 books were 90% drudgery to get through.
B000GH2YPG|4.0|The unnamed protagonist of \\"Rebecca\\" is the young second-wife of the aristocrat Maxim de Winter, a widower of barely eleven months and owner of the famed estate Manderley.  We meet our protagonist in Monte Carlo, where she is employed as the companion to a busy-body dowager, on the day of her first meeting with Maxim de Winter.  From the beginning, duMaurier is constant with her characterization of the narrator:  she is a thoughtful and anxious dreamer, painfully aware of her lower-class station and aspiring for true and ardent love.  Upon her marriage to Mr. de Winter and their arrival in Manderley, she is preoccupied with the mystery of Rebecca, the first Mrs. de Winter.<br /><br />\\"Rebecca\\" is a slow-paced, yet engaging, mystery novel concentrating on the circumstances of Rebecca's death and the hold she has on the inhabitants of Manderley.  duMaurier writes beautiful, vivid prose (albeit occasionally purple)  with much description fixated on Manderley's landscape.  \\"Rebecca\\" reads like Henry James, however our narrator is nowhere as a vivacious as a James heroine.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|Great sound and chatting system which are very easy to install and setup.     If you don't like wires, stay away from it. I thought I wouldn't like having the wires around all the time, but I realized that it does not bother me at all.     I actually prefer this headset over my BT one because I don't need to worry about recharging AND my ears hurt when I use the little BT for a while. In this case, ear force allows me to use the chat system even if I don't have them on (just rest them over your shoulder blades) with the mic up and you're good to go.     In the PS3, make sure your multiple audio option is on, so you can just take the headset off and still use the TV speakers without interrupting your gaming experience.
B004PEJ1H0|5.0|When it comes to remakes of songs, oftentimes not only is the original far superiour, but those newer versions end up leaving a lot to be desired.  With George Michael's version of the New Oder song True Faith, this is not the case.  I find George's version to be a breath of fresh air.  It strikes a chord within as you listen to the lyrics.  Glad I've added this song to my collection.
B0011UBDTK|1.0|Okay all you SITC fans unfortunately this IS NOT a product you want to purchase. Everything looks great but multiple CD's skip and/or will not play.

B004I4H8PO|5.0|I received my Derek & The Dominoes deluxe box set today and was very excited to finally have it arrive having pre-ordered in February. I can sympathize with all here because I, too, received my box and opened it to find a damaged and torn pop-up. The book had apparently bounced around in shipping and torn the right side of the pop-up off. It may sound like a silly complaint but, considering the price of such a set and the nature of the release (40th. anniversary set), you'd think better planning would have been involved. I happen to work for a commercial printer and we strip and create all sorts of books, pocket folder booklets, cardboard stands, posters and various die-cut pieces for high profile customers so I understand what goes into producing such a product. It would have been very simple to either build in something to keep the book stationary or have a form fitted piece of thick foam to separate the book, LP, pin and tickets from the pop-up section so nothing would interfere with it's integrity. Of course, I'm afraid to send it back for fear I may receive one in even worse shape in return.     Aside from this flaw in design, the packaging is quite nice visually, the LP is full sounding and surface noise nearly non-existent. I have not listened to the CDs yet but they are not scratched and did not fall out of the slots so that's a plus.     In the end, the book is nicely done, the LPs quiet, flat and solid and the music superb. I suppose that's truly the important thing here.

B004X0Y5GI|5.0|I have always been a fan of Stevie Nicks' music. This new CD is very much a reminder of why she is the major Rock Goddess that she is. There are many sounds that remind me of her older solo records. Working with Dave Stewart has paid off BIG time. The songs \\"New Orleans\\", \\"Moonlight\\", and \\"Italian Summer\\" are my personal favorites, but the whole album is more than pleasing to any Nicks fan!!
B004UC1WN8|5.0|Jennifer Lopez really knows where her strong points lie and it shows with this carefully selected songs for Love?. Critics may hate it(oh let them be!) but you can't deny the irrestible dance-oriented numbers. I love all her songs but my most favorite is \\"Until It Beats No More\\". One thing that puzzles me is where are the magnificent \\"Louboutins\\" and \\"Fresh Out The Oven\\"? I wish she would included these as well. A great perk-me-ups of an album!
B004BLTNJI|5.0|Unbelievable effect. I got 100% 3d images at times 75 percent a few times and 50 percent most of the time. It was great! I watched it with my 9 year old twins and didn't find anything offensive or inappropriate. Highly recommend for 3D lovers. I rank this with my experience at the movie theater.... one word WOW
1591396190|2.0|As many books of this kind they only write examples of successful business. To make a long story short why they didn't talk about Chrysler Cordoba. This car was the car who rescue Chrysler in 1975 from going belly-up nevertheless in 1980 they rebuild this car and no one bought it. Of course they talk about the Minivan because every car maker in the world now have one. So as many people who write this kind of books they only look for the good decisions and well positioned market. If you do what they say you have 50% of being successful as in everything else that you strive.<br /><br />Why they write about successful companies and they don't say: this and that company that we helped them with this method to thrive are now in the Blue Ocean ALONE?<br /><br />I agree that not only today but always: if you want to do something to have a better product you'll have to go to the Blue Ocean and the first thing to do that is to have the vision of your new product or service.<br /><br />To finish this review no matter what you do to be in the Blue Ocean someone will do the same and you'll be in the Red Ocean in less than a year.

B0041KKYDI|4.0|****1/2<br /><br />Few movies provide as purely visceral an experience as \\"127 Hours,\\" a gripping true-life account of a man who literally gives his right arm to save his life.<br /><br />It was April 2003 when daredevil outdoorsman and experienced rock climber Aron Walston ventured alone into Blue John Canyon in Utah without telling anybody where he was going.  Tragedy struck when a giant boulder came crashing down on him, smashing and pinning his right arm so that Walston was actually left dangling a few feet above the ground.  After more than five days in this position, he made the horrific decision to cut off the arm, thereby freeing himself from his predicament.<br /><br />Given the shockingly gruesome nature of the material, it's possible that many people avoided watching this movie when it played in theaters.  One of the advantages of seeing the movie on DVD is that the faint of heart can fast-forward through the more unsettling parts and not miss out on the overall experience - or James Franco's dazzling and empathic tour-de-force performance.<br /><br />Moments of lucidity alternate with moments of intense unreality and confusion as the hours tick off and Walston increasingly struggles against hunger, thirst, cold, pain and mounting desperation.  What strikes one most about Walston is the amazing resourcefulness and calm demeanor he demonstrates while confronting a situation most of us can imagine only in our worst nightmares.  Walston certainly has time to think back over his life and to consider what exactly brought him to this moment in time and to contemplate the people who've made the deepest impact on him, and how he's treated - and, in some cases, mistreated - them throughout the course of his life.<br /><br />Walston's ordeal resonates with viewers in that it shows us just how vulnerable we are to the cruel exigencies of an indifferent Nature, and how one little mistake or simply being in the wrong place at the wrong time can forever seal our fate.<br /><br />Director Danny Boyle and co-writer Simon Beaufry keep things from becoming unduly claustrophobic by throwing hallucinations, memories and imaginings into the narrative mix and by freely indulging in the hyperkinetic montage sequences that have long been the hallmark of Boyle's style (see \\"Trainspotting\\" and \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\").<br /><br />In terms of acting, this is pretty much a one-man show, but there are important contributions from Amber Tamblyn, Kate Mara and Treat Williams in small but significant roles.<br /><br />Hard as it may be to sit through at times, \\"127 Hours\\" provides us with an unforgettable and ultimately inspiring portrait of a man staring into the face of Death - and making Death blink.Simon Beaufry keep things from becoming unduly claustrophobic by throwing hallucinations, memories and imaginings into the narrative mix and by freely indulging in the hyperkinetic montage sequences that have long been the hallmark of Boyle's style (see \\"Trainspotting\\" and \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\").

B004WPIJ4I|3.0|The track's flow reminds me very much of Bad Romance (Ra ra ah ah ah - Ju da as Ju da as). The metaphor in the track where she compares herself to Jesus and her ex boyfriend as Judas can be slightly uncomfortable to people of Christian faith. I feel slightly let down with her new material like this as it seems to have taken a drastic turn from what we've heard prior to Born This Way.

B003F46RVO|5.0|I never tire of watching this movie. It's a perfect example of 80's moviemaking that stands the test of time. A must-see for anyone who graduated highschool in the late 1980's.
B004IQMXD4|5.0|I have loved Stevie since the 70s...I have loved even her \\"bad\\" cds, simply because it was Stevie.  However, THIS cd is, by far, surprisingly amazing...I cannot believe that today she is #2 on the AMAZON charts and soaring up the Billboard charts.  It just shows the need for real artistry...REAL music...and that a woman in her 60s is just as important (or MORE) than someone in their 20s.  I am sure this will go GOLD and that a lot of young folks who do not know Stevie Nicks will come to love her.  I cannot find a single problem with any of these songs... \\"Italian Summer\\" shows the strength and heartiness of Stevie's voice when really pushed to its limits.  I smell a GRAMMY !!
B004Q1FDHO|5.0|Edit:...Once I got a different phone (Bionic) the program worked quite well.  It is an entertaining game for what it is...morbid however.  Nice to see something the goes against all the PC police.  ...  I can't really rate the game since I cannot get it to load on my Droid X.  As soon as I attempt to load/start the game it hangs on the initial \\"HandyGames\\" logo screen. When I hit the sleep button on the phone and then turn it back on it is still locked on the logo screen but will then have music.  Nothing else happens and I have to force close to exit.  No matter what I do, it will not get past the logo screen. While hanging on the logo screen, hitting the edit button, or far left button on the phone, will bring up the game settings and I can access the vibrate/music/info settings, then it still hangs once I get out of them.  I have uninstalled/re-installed a few times, including shutting the phone off & pulling the battery to reset everything then install and attempt to run.  Install first then shut phone off and attempt to run.  Clear the cache and the data under manage applications in the settings.  Also attempt to load it while installed on the phone then on the SD card.  Nothing has worked as of yet.  Goodluck Mr. Dev., hopefully the solution isn't too hard to fix.
1856697061|5.0|As others have said, not for a novice.  This is for the experienced seamstress/designer.  There are some truly inventive ideas that would be terrific for the avant garde fashion or costume designer.  There are also some very wearable ideas as well.  The vanishing pocket and lapels are too fun.  The front and back cowls are beautiful.  This book could most definitely inspire some truly unique necklines.

1416550550|4.0|Kate Morton's second novel is a beautiful tale about three generations of women, all seeking to find themselves in some way. However, the main story is the search for Nell's parentage. The chapters alternate between different characters and times, however each is clearly marked at the start of the chapter and the same part of the storyline generally continues, just told by a different person.    The book opens in 1913, when a young girl with no name is found on a quayside in Australia. She doesn't remember anything about herself and all she carries with her is a white suitcase containing among other personal items a book of fairytales penned by a woman the girl calls the `Authoress'. The writing shifts back and forth between 2005, 1975 and 1900, spanning Australia, London and Cornwall, gradually reveals the story, peeling back the layers to uncover the truth a little at a time.    It can be a grueling read at close to 700 pages but the mystery itself kept me reading and speculating. Clues are parceled out in small doses and it takes a long time, almost to the end before one can put together a clear picture. I loved this style and the way the author scattered subtle clues throughout the chapters. You will find your mind racing ahead to leap to conclusions, then as the end draws near it wasn't as you thought - or was it? Unlike The House at Riverton, I found the writing style was very engaging and I wanted to keep reading right through to the end - it was a real page turner for me. A delightful story that will hold you enthralled until the very end.

B0015KO52S|5.0|I dig this album more and more. I love the guitar tone and the veriety of different guitar sounds throughout. It really gives it a lot of dynamics. The super overdriven fuzz guitar parts are huge. I also rwally like to words on Carolina Dreams.
B004LL1HM4|4.0|Fleet Foxes seemingly came out of nowhere in 2008 with the promising \\"Sun Giant\\" EP, followed later in the year with their self-titled album, which immediately won critical acclaim. After lots of touring and a botched attempt to record a new album (the band scrapped the first recording sessions), now finally comes the highly anticipated second album.<br /><br />\\"Helplessness Blues\\" (12 tracks; 50 min.) is no radical departure from the first album, sounding ever more gorgeous, if anything. Singer-songwriter Robin Pecknold continues to explore the sounds of spaceous folk-rock, with clear influences from Simon and Garfunkel, and the intrecate vocal interplay (reminicent of, say, the Beach Boys) are even more in the forefront than on the debut album. All of of this is a good thing. The album kicks off with a gentle \\"Montezuma\\" and great tracks follow one after another. It is clear that Pecknold has thrown his heart and soul into making this album. Special mention goes to track 5, \\"The Plains/Bitter Dancer\\", which is really several songs into one track, but it works just beautiful. The title track follows, and is of course nothing \\"blues\\"-like, but in the ache that the song brings about. A short instrumental \\"The Gascades\\" is the bridge into the second half of the album. \\"Lorelai\\" is a sunny love-song. It eventually leads to track 11 \\"Blue Spotted Tail\\", just Pecknold solo on acoustic guitar, and it would be a fine album closer in my book. But it is followed by one more track \\"Grown Ocean\\", which is not bad, but somehow for me it felt like one song too many. But it's a minor quibble, to be honest. In all, this is clearly one of the best albums of the year so far.<br /><br />With the unexpected (and on-going) chart success of Mumford and Sons, and this being such a highly anticipated album, I'm guessing this album is going to crash into the top ranks of the Billboard 200 album chart upon its release, and deseverdly so. I had the chance of catching Fleet Foxes live at the Coachella music festival in April, 2009, and they were one of THE highlights of the festival for me, just mesmorizing. Equally great was the rare solo set that Robin Pecknold brought here in Cincinnati in April, 2010 at the MusicNOW festival (curated by the Dessner brothers of the National), in which he brought several of these new songs (along with some covers and nuggets from the debut album). What a set that was. Meanwhile, \\"Helplessness Blues\\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!c festival in April, 2009, and they were one of THE highlights of the festival for me, just mesmorizing.

B004XWLN20|4.0|The only reason i did not give this 5 stars is because its not in Blue Ray. When season 10 comes out Im hoping that they will have a box collection in Blue ray right now i own season 1-9 on DVD! I would be all for paying 250.00 for it if it was on blue ray even 300.00 for all 10 seasons on Blue Ray!
0689859368|5.0|I am a big fan of both Black and DiTerlizzi, but I had not gotten around to going back and reading these books. I must admit after reading this first one, I will be devouring the rest of this series and the three books in the Beyond Spiderwick series. I have seen and enjoyed the movie but so long ago it did not affect my reading of the book. I had big expectations for this book and it did not disappoint.<br /><br />The five books in this series can really be taken as one continuous story. Yet they were originally published individually. They are available in a boxed set and a single volume omnibus edition. But no matter how you read them you will be enchanted by the world presented by Black and DiTerlizzi.<br /><br />The story follows 3 children, Jarod, Simon, and Mallory as they move into a relative's home. Soon they discover the house has secrets, from a dumb waiter, to a hidden library, and even residents that the children previously would not have believed existed. This first instalment into their story is fun and rambunctious as children are often wont to be. It is the beginning of what looks to be an awesome series.
B004YSDU9C|5.0|More happened in the hour and a half two-part opening of the series than in most full seasons of television. It's a wild ride, even though the most intriguing mysteries (the astronaut, the lake scene, the little girl, and the Silence's TARDIS) won't be explained for a few months. The tally marks on the companion's skin were great visuals that complemented the extremely eerie Silence. I don't want to spoil anything, but if the first two episodes are anything to judge by, this is going to be the best Series yet.    P.S. - Any scene with Nixon in it is hilarious.

0345522478|5.0|I must say, when I read all of the praise from this book's editor I was wary...it always seems although the books with huge amounts of praise end up falling short of my expectations. This one, however, didn't - in fact, it probably exceeded them.<br /><br />Hounded, by Kevin Hearne, is about Atticus, the last of the druids. While he tries to maintain a low profile - spending his time at his shop, running with his wolfhound or doing lawn maintenance for a local Irish widow - he is also hiding from a god who wants a certain sword he possesses. Early on, it becomes apparent that not only has Atticus now been found, but that he may no longer be able to run.<br /><br />I felt this was a great book - something that can be hard to find in today's fantasy genre. The characters were well developed and interesting...even Atticus' hound (who was one of my favorite characters). The author also created a great web of intrigue with interplay between most of the forces in the book that was often not immediately apparent. I had a very hard time putting this book down once I picked it up, and I enjoyed it immensely. I would highly recommend it to anyone, but especially fans of the fantasy genre.
0817439390|4.0|I would recommend this book to anyone wanting to gain a better understanding of photography.  I am still in the early stages of photography, but I feel this book gave me a great start.  Bryan Peterson explains things clearly and in a way that is easy to understand.  It's full of pictures with an explanation of how he took them.  There have been times when reading that I felt a little frustrated because I didn't have the same powerful lenses like he has used, therefore could not mimic a specific technique; but other than that, the book has been a great tool for learning the different aspects of photography (i.e; shutter speed, aperture, back lighting, etc.)
B004Q1FDHO|5.0|What makes a good mobile game? One that you can easily pick up, get that quick fix, and leaves you wanting more. This one has that.   My only complaint is it's a bit of system hog. But if you know how to manage your device *cough* not an ignorant Android user *cough* you'll have no problems dealing with it.
B001R4MEU2|5.0|For those of you looking for the greatest example of progressive rock, you don't need to look any further.  This cd has it all--- magical lyrics dated in medieval times, various time signatures, and fantastic vocals by Peter Gabriel.  This in my opinion is the greatest arrangement of music Genesis has produced.  I can't just listen to one song, but have to listen to the entire cd over and over.  This is a true desert island disc.  One of my top 5 favorites of all time regardless of genre.

0425241505|4.0|In the New York Magic District, known locally as the Cauldron, hybrid human-Wyr Pia Giovanni knows her mission is fatal, but feels she has few options.  Her slimy ex blackmails her into stealing a penny from Dragos Cuelebre, a powerful Elder Race dragon.  Though she left a penny behind and an apology note, Pia knows he will find her with the only question being when.  She is so desperate she buys a binding spell from Adela the witch owner of Divinus.<br /><br />Dragos tracks down the thief, but instead of killing Pia as she expects, he is attracted to her.  Soon after their first in person encounter, Goblins attack them and capture them.  Dragos realizes a very powerful adversary the Dark Fae King Urien wants him dead and that Pia could be caught in the crossfire if his ancient enemy learns who she is to him.<br /><br />This is an entertaining romantic urban fantasy starring two intriguing individuals as the heroine is Manhattan shtick and the hero is alpha male.  The story line roars out of the gate like the express train under the streets as the irate Dragos, known for dining on humans, seeks the thief while Pia seeks her fifteen minutes of fame.  Although his possessiveness of his mate is overkill (even if he has an ancient lifetime), sub-genre fans will enjoy the denizen of the Cauldron as like much of the Big Apple light and dark energies flow freely, just more eerier there as a paranormal hangout for dragons, wyr, witches and fae, etc.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner

0345522478|5.0|Atticus O'Sullivan the Druid has lived for over two millennia and in that time he has made friends like Van Gogh and Galileo but also has alienated essences who want him dead.  Some are extremely powerful, but perhaps his most persistent and strongest enemy is the Celtic God Aenghus Og.  The Druid stole a magic sword from the God who vowed to hunt him down, kill him, and retrieve the sword.  Over the centuries, Og has located Atticus, but his attempts to kill his adversary have failed.<br /><br />O'Sullivan plays soccer while he also owns and operates Third Eye Books and Herbs store (hiding his Celtic heritage behind eastern beliefs) in Tempe Arizona.  He has kept a low profile so that his sworn foes will not easily find him.  Og locates him again and sends his nastiest minion to take care of him with instructions not to come back alive without his sword and O'Sullivan's corpse.  The Druid's faithful Irish wolfhound Oberon is acceptable collateral damage.<br /><br />This is a super urban fantasy in which the Hearne's mythos comes across as possible due to reasonable explanations interwoven into the fast-paced plot.  Readers rather quickly anticipate an OK Corral showdown between the Druid and the God once Og locates the rodent who desiccated his deity.  Sub-genre fans will appreciate Kevin Hearne's humorous tale of the \\"Mouse That Roared\\" against the superpower.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner

I have recently started some barefoot running to strengthen my legs and upper body and to be honest, it hurt like mad for the first few runs.

I still do my marathons and ultras in shoes but barefoot training is now a core part!
0345529057|5.0|I read the 3 and 4th book on the Kindle. And I just wanted to say that on the new kindle there is no problems with formating. Maybe they re-formated it since it came out. But it was an incredible read and I have recommended it to a number of people who all read it and loved it.
B004Q1FDHO|5.0|This game has lots of upgrades,  pretty good graphics and silly stories.  It is a fun game and def worth a buck.
B002ZG99QS|2.0|This movie essentially just follows the same path as the original.  * \\"User\\" gets sucked into the Grid.  * User forced to take part in the games.  * User escapes into computer \\"wilderness\\"  * USer travels across vast \\"wilderness\\" in order to leave/confront final villian.  * User excapes back to the real world.    This movie, however, does have superior special effects, but the idea of a world inside a computer (that each program is a little digital person) just does not work in this day and age. Overall, just eye candy with the same dull plot as the first.    (Of course, if the little \\"program\\" people constantly \\"froze\\", with little hour glasses evenly, when there were too many of them in a room at the same time, I would have found it at least a little more realistic.)
B004UC1WN8|5.0|This album is her best work to date.  Every song is catchy and fun.  The standard version comes with 1 bonus track, the deluxe edition, which I suggest getting, comes with 5 bonus tracks.  Get the deluxe edition, it's worth it.  Sony Records/Epic Records is stupid for parting ways with the pop queen.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I am an avid book reader, and have come to be quite fond of the YA genre of books. I hadn't heard of The Hunger Game series until about a week ago when a friend eagerly told me to read the series. I decided to order the book on my Kindle, and from the first page I was hooked.     The Hunger Games opens up with you meeting 16 year old Katniss Everdeen who lives in the post-apocalyptic world of Panem. The book is greatly paced as it opens up with the introduction of the characters and the hardships that they face in District 12, and then shoots you off into the Hunger Games quickly. Throughout the book it has enough suspense and action to not want to put it down, which myself I read in one sitting.     The ending of the book sets up for the second book nicely, and you'll definitely be wanting to read the rest of the series. If you love a book with good action, suspense and a little romance thrown in, you'll love The Hunger Games.
B004Q1FDHO|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised at how fun this game is to play. It has enough depth in career mode to keep it interesting,  making me want to come back. At the same time, it's &quot;light&quot; and sort of whimsical. A great balance for casual gaming. Also enjoy playing it with my 6-year old son. 5 stars!

B004NSULHM|5.0|Once again a brilliant album by a band that refuses to stand still.  This is to In Rainbows as Amnesiac was to Kid A.  Younger fans won't notice, but many of the sounds harken back to the 80s soundscapes by Jon Hassell, and some of the layers-building to David Byrne, Brian Eno and some David Sylvian.  But it's still fresh, original and uniquely Radiohead.    I imagine many won't like it:  there's not a single \\"single\\" on this album.  It's a dreamscape/soundscape that works in its entirety, probably not as well on a random shuffle playlist.  But these are the kinds of albums I look forward to most.  Thanks Radiohead, you made my day (again).

I highly recommend this for anyone with young children.
0470901071|5.0|Todd Lammle is an excellent writer, he knows how to make a challenging topic easy to learn. One of my favorite chapters is chapter 3 \\"Subnetting\\". Honestly, if you follow his steps you will be a master on how to subnet in your head. Once you learn this skill, VLSM design and summarization is a piece of cake! The 36 Steps in IP Routing found in chapter 6 was an eye opener. There you will get an in-depth understanding of the ip routing process which is an essential skill to have when troubleshooting the internetwork. This book will not only help you pass the CCNA, but also become a proficient Cisco Network Administrator. I had so much fun with this book that I read it 3 times, as a result I passed my CCNA with a high score and I found a job as an NA with the US Army.

The main characters are a tight knit group who have come together over this first season.    The season starts with the cast as they first meet. Then as each show develops, we see the characters and their friendships also developing. The investigation techniques, the danger, the plots...all are becoming better and better. And the rapport, friendships, and best of all the humor, tie it all up for the viewers to enjoy.

1932100660|5.0|This book and the studies within are a hugely NEEDED wakeup call for our society. We changed our diet last year to a mostly plant based diet and I cannot even begin to tell you all the amazing benefits we've seen thus far.  Additionally, my mother in law works in a hospital who has recently implemented the CHIP program, which was also founded by the author of this book.  A very smart man trying his hardest to honestly change this country's horrible eating habits.  This book was just one of many that contributed to our family's nutritional education.  Highly recommended for anyone who puts food in their mouths, especially mothers responsible for feeding children.

B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|First of all, I am Ronnette, Richard's wife, writing this review, but hubby loves the show too! I live for Mondays now!  I will be honest and admit that any show Alex O'Loughlin stars in would be a show I'd watch each week.  It is a triple bonus that he is starring in a show filmed in stunningly beautiful Hawaii, and that the chemistry of the entire cast is so good that 5-0 has easily become the best drama/comedy on television. Clever writing, Alex's brilliant portrayal of McGarrett, the insanely funny banter between him and Danno ( I often find Steve's dry humor the most amusing), and the infectious characters of Chin and Kono have made 5-0 stand out among all shows on any network line-up. Thankyou Peter Lenkov, and all who make this unforgettable hour come alive each week.  I wish there were 7 Mondays to my week (: xox Ronnette

1401323952|4.0|The term comfort food comes to my mind when I think about how to describe this book. The recipes are probably not the most sophisticated or fast to make but they sure are a very homey, tasty, rich (not intended for dieters), and it's filled with so many, it is difficult not to find something you'll like. The writing style is detailed, straightforward and has the same warm and approachable quality that Nigella has in her TV show (don't miss the notes at the beginning, there are some great cooking tips). It's also well illustrated, I love when books have a picture for every single recipe, and extra images of the preparation process. Overall I think it's a great addition to the household, most recipes are family friendly and has with a huge variety of sweet treats.
1600245617|4.0|Like most audio books, Child 44 had a great narrator. Dennis Boutsikaris was unbelievable...incorporating accents, sounding like women. I could have listened to him read the phone book.<br /><br />Luckily, I didn't have to. Child 44 was incredibly exciting. Set in Communist Russia (a period and place that I normally don't care about), the murder mystery hunt for the serial killer in this audio held my attention through work outs, traffic jams, and cleaning.<br /><br />Child 44 is a great book, and it translated very well to audio.
0061537969|5.0|I have no idea who told me about this book, but it was an absolute delight!!!  It was so good that I bought 16 copies of it to share with my book club members and after we're done with it, I will donate the set to our public library for their book club selection shelf. This book has everything in it, love, tears, drama, comedy and a satisfactory ending. Enjoy!!!
B0041KKYBA|1.0|Watcher beware.  Tthis movie is a diservice to all Americans.  The intent of this movie is to misslead you into blaming the wrong people.  There is no mention of the real culprits.  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernake are resposible for the housing crisis.  See \\"Peter Schiff Was Right\\" on youtube and \\"Peter Schiff Mortgage Bankers Speech\\" on youtube.  Both video were shot before the housing crisis and in both videos he warns that government policy is going to cause a housing crash.  Do yourself a favor and watch a video from someone who warned about the housing crisis and not some liberal morons who still don't have a clue as to what happened.<br /><br />More importantly, Peter Schiff is now predicting a much harder fall for the US within a few years.  We are going to have a bond crisis and the value of the dollar will plummet.  Check out schiffradio(dot)com.<br /><br />What about the deregulation myth? That is a liberal talking point but there is no truth to it.<br /><br />There are lots of dirty details we will never know. Worse of all, no one will be punished for their crimes. However, the movie is misleading because it never explains the cause of all the abuse and fraud. It all started with the fed setting the funds rate so low and fannie and Freddie guaranteeing the loans. Wallstreet has always been greedy. The fact that they could loan out money to anyone and have no risk of repayment started the ball rolling. It grew from there and wallstreet worked with rating agencies to dump junk bonds onto foreign investors and rated them at AAA. But if you took the fed out and fannie and Freddie out, none of this would have happened. Since the movie leaves this out, it portrays the collapse as a result of too much greed and not enough regulation. When nothing could be further from the truth. The housing bubble is a function of government getting their hands into the free market and distorting it. If the movie doesn't say that, then their message is aimed at misleading you. So far government has won too. They have most people convinced it was greedy wallstreet and not enough regulation. They caused it and now they get more power and control for it. This movie is just going to make the problem worse.<br /><br />Read \\"Crash Proof 2.0\\" by Peter Schiff. it was written before the housing crisis and predicted it with great detail. It even included the bankruptcy of GM. He knew the crisis was coming because he understands money and the roll of the federal reserve. Other economists also saw it coming, most were Austrian economists. They understand the boom and bust cycle.ou. So far government has won too.

B000T9OP7G|5.0|i found the series very enjoyable. it is hard not to enjoy watching summer glau. it seems like trained ballet dancers often make good action heroes.   this is also a heads up to buyers. i picked these two seasons up new for $15 each. i have noticed that unless it is hard to find such as some of the cult movies a buyer should at least check around. one local grocery store that runs a rental corner seems to liquidate at $5 fairly quickly. another place to find very good deals is blockbuster. sometimes the rentals for sale do not have special features.   i like and appreciate amazon. it is still good to look a bit before ordering. last night i came across t2 in a collectors edition for $5.  some of the cult movies seem pricey. before i buy any i will take a look at a store that is about twenty miles from home which is a trade in used movies store. i am definitely a collector. some hard to find titles show up at these places for a fraction of what they sell online for.  regards,  poacher
B002QW7AJY|3.0|Pandorum is not nearly as bad as some of the hard core haters would like you to believe. It was fun, interesting, a bit scary, and even had a neat twist ending. Overall, it was an entertaining 'B' popcorn movie that actually rated an 'A' in a few places. The practical set design was especially good and the monsters were honestly frightening.

B004OKFISQ|4.0|As a member of the Steve Hoffman Forums since about 2004 or so, I was aware of this Hoffman/Gray cut of 'Rumours' as per Hoffman's announcement in 2007. Of course, the delay in its release has been well documented.     It is interesting to consider that when this release was announced, Hoffman stated the following:     \\"You are going to hear RUMOURS exactly like it was recorded and mixed; no revisionist mastering, no bass bump, treble boosting, compression, echo adding or other signal processing done by us.\\"    Exciting news, indeed. But upon this mastering finally seeing the light of day, Hoffman posted the following to his website as regards some of the work that was done:    \\"FLEETWOOD MAC \\"Rumours\\" Mastering EQ for Steve Hoffman-Kevin Gray vinyl versions, 45 RPM and 33 1/3 RPM, June 6, 2007. Edited.     Sontec analog equalization (all with \\"6\\" slope)     Side One:     1. +2@ 3400, +2@ 6800, +1@10k Shelf, +1@50 Shelf, +3@42  2. +2@ 3400, +2@6800, +1@ 10k Shelf, -2@ 100, -1@ 50 Shelf  3. FLAT  4. +1@ 3400, +1@ 6800, +1@ 10k Shelf, +1@ 42  5. +1@ 3400, +1@ 6800, No 10k, +2@ 40  6. +1@ 100, +1@ 50 Shelf     Side Two:     1. +1@ 3400, +1@ 6800, No 10k, -1@ 100  2. +2@ 3400, +1@ 6800, +1@ 10  3. +2@ 3400, +1@ 6800 --------  4. +2@ 3400, +1@ 6800 --------  5. +1@ 3400, +1@ 6800, +1@ 42, +1@ 50 Shelf\\"      Obviously, this doesn't seem to align with his original statement. Surely one cannot dispute the right of a mastering engineer to make whatever \\"adjustments\\" he might deem necessary to benefit a recording, but this seemed a bit odd to me. After all, Hoffman seemed fairly passionate about this album being presented as it was originally recorded. Was he saying that if he decides to make EQ moves that deviate from those on the master tape that it is still how the album was \\"originally recorded\\" and intended to sound?     How does that compute?      As a long tenured member of the Hoffman website, many are probably familiar with my views as regards the way music is best treated in \\"mastering.\\" I owe quite a bit to Hoffman and others for opening my ears up. Over the years, I have enjoyed most of the work I have heard from Hoffman, but I confess that as the years have passed, his attitude towards many members on his site is nothing short of condescending nonsense. Watching his site has almost become like watching some type of \\"cult.\\" Members are lambasted for anything they say that goes \\"against the grain.\\" If they don't happen to agree with Hoffman, it is often suggested by he and/or others that something must be wrong with their system, etc. Comments sometimes appear and seem to be deleted if they question anything he does. Many members there seem to have very little pride when it comes to having their own opinions as regards sonics. If one mastering engineer uses EQ, it was wrong to do so, but if Steve does it, it becomes the \\"definitive\\" version.    Hoffman has rolled tapes flat before, and to my thinking, should be commended for that. And I certainly am not suggesting he was obligated to stick with his original comments and not make some adjustments for this album, but after receiving the \\"other\\" pressing, I became curious and took it for a spin. After all, on the Hoffman site, almost no comments existed about it. Mainly people returning them, unopened. Mainly people speculating as to the source involved, etc.    When I heard the 2LP 45RPM \\"EU\\" cut, I was astonished at how good it was. There was a warmth to it that I found to be just about perfect for this album. No top end boost was apparent, the acoustic guitars melted into the mix instead of cutting into it, the vinyl was dead quiet and sounded almost like a CD. I was pleasantly surprised.     At this point, I hadn't heard the Hoffman/Gray version. Given the absolute chaos that seemed to be developing at the Hoffman site from people receiving the \\"other\\" version, I decided to simply post that it sounded very nice and was quite impressive.    Those comments were almost immediately deleted.    As a long time member of the Hoffman site, this was upsetting. After all, this was a \\"discussion forum,\\" but to make matters more confounding, I had said nothing about the Hoffman/Gray cut and even mentioned that I looked forward to comparing it with the \\"EU\\" mastering.     At that point, I posted a review on Amazon.ca, as I had received the \\"EU\\" pressing from them. I was positive about it. I said nothing about the Hoffman/Gray cut as I had not heard it yet. I attempted to post a link to my review on the Hoffman site as more and more people seemed concerned about how the \\"EU\\" pressing sounded, but my link was immediately deleted.    As unnecessary as this all seemed, I just ignored it. After all, I have many friends and people I admire at the Hoffman site and rarely find myself involved in any conversations where he participates anyway. I have respect for his work but try to judge it without prejudice. That seems to be uncommon there. In fact, it often appears that when he remasters something, people begin to jump up and down and render any and all other versions irrelevant. And this seems to happen before it is even released! It is rare that anything he works on is compared with other versions or things like tonality differences are discussed. Basically, it often seems to be *presumed* that other versions came from a vastly inferior source tape and were done by somebody who could never compete with Hoffman. Surely this could be true in some cases, but I tend to like to do my own comparisons and judge each matter on its own merits.    A couple of days after my review at Amazon Canada, I received the Hoffman/Gray mastering. I found it to be excellent, but was somewhat surprised that I still preferred the \\"EU\\" mastering. Why was I surprised? Was it just from reading comment after comment about how that \\"EU\\" cut *must* be inferior to anything done by Hoffman? Well, one thing was for certain, I could not ignore what I heard, and while the Hoffman/Gray cut had a nice \\"sparkle\\" to the midrange and top end, it sounded overly EQd in comparison. Right from the harmonic fills on acoustic guitar that Buckingham throws in on \\"Second Hand News,\\" it really seemed to border on \\"tinny.\\" On the \\"EU\\" pressing, those fills just melt right into the mix. Here, they were kind of riding on top and the drums sounded a bit too \\"crispy\\" for my taste.     I updated my review at Amazon.ca and gave the most fair, honest comparison between the two masterings that I could. I even complimented the Hoffman/Gray cut and stated that I was sure they had done their best to put forth a quality product. Still, to my ears, the \\"EU\\" pressing was just better balanced. The top end was glorious, whereas the US issue seemed a bit overcooked. Whether someone had different ears for this album or a different source, how could I know? But it sounded better to me. Of course, as regards the \\"other\\" (aka \\"wrong\\") vinyl reissue, pure speculation began running rampant on the Hoffman site. Many suggested that the source for the \\"EU\\" pressing was probably digital, etc. Absolute guesswork and nearly all of it from people who had not heard the mastering in question.    After updating my review at Amazon.ca and giving my honest opinion, the Hoffman site had comments about how the \\"reviewer\\" (and my own name is on it -- same thing here) must be a troll or someone with an \\"agenda.\\" It was simply beyond belief. Surely any comments from people who knew me and who knew better than to believe such utter nonsense were probably being deleted at a rapid fire pace. I was then banned from the Hoffman site. With probably 8,000+ posts there, I was unable to login. I wasn't even able to make contact with the many friends I had there to make sure they had my direct email for future contact.     And this was a result of simply being of the opinion that while the Hoffman/Gray mastering of 'Rumours' was nice, the \\"EU\\" mastering was better.
0425241505|5.0|I read a lot of books. I read a lot of paranormal books. So when one comes into the Smexy household that is exciting, refreshing and just all around awesome, it is cause for celebration!<br /><br />Dragon Bound by Thea Harrison is the first book in the Elder Races series. Our hero, Dragos Cuelebre is of the Wyr, a group of powerful, ancient shapeshifters. Dragos more specifically is a  rare dragon-shifter created around the time of the solar system - so yes, he is ancient to say the least. In present day he is head of the Wyr demesnes located in New York city. The other six demesnes, including Elven, Fae etc...reside in other parts of the United States. He is extremely powerful, wealthy and demands loyalty and obedience from everyone in his control. So when someone breaks into his hoard, something that has never happened before and steals from him, his anger as he takes to the sky in his dragon form can literally be felt and heard from everyone in the city.<br /><br />Pia Giovanni is a half-breed - half human, half wyr. Raised by her mother who embedded in her mind to never tell anyone what her half-wyr side is, she has always been on the run. But now she has herself in a bit of a bind. She let her guard down with her ex-boyfriend Keith and revealed to him a bit about herself. Something she has never done with another before. Then Keith turned out to be a jerk and to cover his gambling debts, is now blackmailing her with this secret information about herself. He hands over to her a finding charm which with her special powers leads her directly into Dragos' hoard and demands that she steal something from Dragos to appease his \\"associates.\\" She gets in and steals one of his pennies.<br /><br />When Dragos discovers this theft, he makes it his mission to find who did this. But soon, they both realize there is a bigger player at stake. The Dark Fae King and Dragos have bad blood and a war is on the horizon.<br /><br />When we first meet Dragos, he reminded me very much of Raphael from Nalini Singh's Guild Hunter series. He is extremely powerful, intense, dark and just a bad ass. But Dragos soon comes into his own. He has been around since the beginning of time, yet some modern things still confuse him. Like slurpees and twizzlers. But don't let that trick you because he runs one of the biggest corporations in the world. Cuelebre Towers employees thousands of people and he rules with a strict hand. But his dragon side also rules his actions throughout this book -  something Pia must come to terms with.<br /><br />When Dragos finally tracks down Pia, his anger soon turns to fascination. He quickly discovers her sticky situation with being blackmailed and realizes a bigger player is calling the shots. He finds himself no longer bored, and very physically attracted to this half breed.<br /><br />Pia is a really great heroine. Strong, outspoken, and stands up to the over-bearing Dragos. He is kind of a \\"caveman\\" when it comes to romance. He isn't suave, or charming. He expects her to follow his orders when it comes to her safety but also in the romance department. But as Pia comes to mean more to him, he wants to learn to be a better lover. I love how we are constantly reminded of how powerful and old he really is.<br /><br />Pia is strong-willed and butts heads with him about this behavior on many occasions. But there is also humor and warmth in their relationship. Their romance is a quick one in this book - I believe the entire book takes place over about five days. Which I know seems crazy, but it is totally believable. Dragos has the \\"mine\\" concept from very early on, and Pia herself desperate not to be lonely in life, falls for him just as quickly.<br /><br />The romance is very erotic, and just as intense as Dragos himself.  I also adored the supporting characters. Rune, Dragos' \\"First\\" and best friend along with Dragos' other trusted friends guard Pia with their life, although they don't like her at first. But Dragos soon puts them in their place.<br /><br /> The writing is just superb. There are a few scenes where the action is violent and rough that just made my hair stand on end. Chapter seven holds my absolute favorite scene in the book. Dragos and Pia have been captured and Dragos knows he can't immediately get them out of harms way. For such a powerful, irate being having to tell this woman who he has started to have protective feelings for that she is going to get hurt, was really amazing to read. You can feel the fear coming off Pia. A brief moment from this chapter:<br /><br />\\"Here's what I think is going to happen. They're going to separate us. They might hurt you.\\" His grip tightened to the point of pain. \\"They won't kill you. They'll have seen I was tending to you in some way, so they'll want to use you as leverage to control me. Goblins have no interest in human women. They' won't rape you.\\"<br /><br />A spasm of trembling hit her, and then it was gone again and she was calm. \\"It's all right,\\" she told him. \\"I'm all right. I'm glad you're telling me this.\\"<br /><br />\\"That's my good brave girl.\\"<br /><br />What follows is a terribly violent, emotionally filled chapter that just blew me away.<br /><br />This world is really fantastic - exciting, very sexy and humorous. Fans of paranormal romance must read this book.few scenes where the action is violent and rough that just made my hair stand on end. Chapter seven holds my absolute favorite scene in the book.

B000JMLFLW|5.0|Pride and Prejudice is one of the greatest novels in English literature and is truly deserving of being called a classic. First published in 1813, it is set at the turn of the 19th century in a fictional town near London. Mr. and Mrs. Bennet are blessed with five daughters, ranging in age from 15 to 22. The novel opens with Mrs. Bennet anxiously thinking about how to marry her daughters off, as that was the primary way for women to achieve financial security during those times. The story is told in third person from the point of view of the second eldest daughter Elizabeth Bennet.<br /><br />Of the four Jane Austen novels that I've read, Pride and Prejudice is my favorite. This is not because I didn't enjoy the others, I most certainly did, but rather because Pride and Prejudice affected me on so many different levels. It touched my heart and swept me away, as I absolutely fell in love with Mr. Darcy. It also provoked my mind, as I reflected upon the many issues that Austen explores in this novel. It is a subtle book, as all Jane Austen novels are, and that is its beauty. All of the issues that Jane Austen raises in this book slowly simmer in your mind.<br /><br />One of the reasons I love Pride and Prejudice is that it is a romance for those with a bit of a feminist streak. Elizabeth Bennet is a strong character who isn't afraid to speak her mind. She is no weak wallflower. Many romantic plots feature a damsel in distress who is saved by her knight in shining armor. That is most definitely not the case here. The love story in Pride and Prejudice shows that you can have chivalrous man and grand romantic gestures without a weak heroine.<br /><br />I also love Pride and Prejudice for Austen's excellent treatment of the characters. Both of the main characters, Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, grow, develop, and change throughout the novel. Their character developments are deep, thorough, and convincing. In contrast, the supporting characters do not change much. Their constancy provides a nice point of comparison to the growth of the main characters.<br /><br />The novel is a full-fledged social commentary on marriage, love, money, wealth, social class, propriety, as well as pride and prejudice. It is fascinating to learn how different those times were from today, especially in the lack of opportunity for women; and yet, it is even more fascinating to think about how relevant the issues are to today. The more things change, the more they seem to stay the same.<br /><br />If you only read one Jane Austen novel, let it be Pride and Prejudice. Be patient with the old English language. It is not an easy read, but it is worth your while.provides a nice point of comparison to the growth of the main characters.<br /><br />The novel is a full-fledged social commentary on marriage, love, money, wealth, social class, propriety, as well as pride and prejudice.

0307593495|5.0|The Troubled Man is a bittersweet ending to the Kurt Wallander series.  As there are many excellent reviews here, I just want to pay homage to Henning Mankell. Thank you Mr. Mankell for giving us Kurt Wallander;  he will be missed.    P.S. The last page is as powerful an ending as I've ever read.
B004X0XA82|5.0|Something remarkable is going on here and its great to watch and listen. Two observations to start with, if as suggested in the music press that Fleet Foxes main man Robin Pecknold has poured his heart and soul into their second album \\"Helplessness blues\\" it has paid off and this not only equals their great debut but surpasses it. The second reflection is that New Musical Express has given this album a paltry two stars in a hideously awful review from an increasingly irrelevant music magazine. This in itself should encourage you to buy it since \\"Helplessness blues\\" is a triumphant classic and while its stays firmly within the orbit of harmony heavy folk rock of \\"Ragged Wood\\" it marks a substantial and mature progression for this Seattle band. This is particularly pronounced in terms of Pecknold's songwriting skills which take off into the stratosphere and the band produce some of the greatest soaring harmony singing this side of Simon and Garfunkel's \\"Bookends\\" and the great debut by Crosby, Stills and Nash.<br /><br />Start with the brilliant title track. This song is divided into two parts firstly a introspective set of lyrics by Pecknold leads to a vocal tour de force which at 2.58 then moves into a sublime Fleet Foxes harmony workout. It is easily one of the best songs released this year but is matched on the album but equally bold contributions. \\"Sim Sala Bim\\" is delightful haunting folk song which splits into two parts with the CSN influence especially pronounced in its forceful second part. The reflective opener \\"Montezuma\\" sees Pecknold in a pensive mood questioning, \\"So now I am older/Than my mother and father/, When they had their daughter/Now what does that say about me\\" over almost warm religious style harmonies. It contrasts with the joyous \\"Battery Kinzie\\" probably the song that could have sat most happily on their debut. The albums centerpieces are two episodic songs of which first up is \\"The Plains/Bitter Dancer\\" a six minute journey containing some of the albums best harmonies and the albums longest track \\"The Shrine/An argument\\" a sort of baroque \\"Paranoid Android' with a powerful vocal by Pecknold which takes us on a journey from folk to a wig out free jazz conclusion. It is stirring perfection and will take audiences by storm on the forthcoming UK tour.<br /><br />Other highlights include \\"Lorelai\\" which owes a huge debt to one of Dylan's best but not always most heralded songs \\"4th Time Round\\" from \\"Blonde on Blonde\\". Then there is the intriguing instrumental \\"Cascades\\", the slightly jazzy \\"Bedouin Dress\\" and two of the most gorgeous songs Pecknold has penned. First the lush \\"Something to admire\\" and the truly sublime sparse acoustics of \\"Blue Spotted Tail\\" where we can forgive Pecknold's \\"hippy\\" affectations for the wonderful sweet yearning which underpins it.

B002MQYOFW|3.0|Just bought my Kindle and this was the first title I downloaded.  I had not heard of the author or the book before.  I was delighted with it.  The style is simple, uncomplicated and would be an ideal book for a vacation. It is not too deep and is probably aimed at teenagers but having left my teens behind a long time ago, I sill enjoyed it.    I have ordered the second title in the series and look forward to it.
B003UESJHO|5.0|Best acting job Christian Bale has ever done. Excellent movie. Mark Wahlberg great, rate it an 8.5. Purchased through Amazon, delivered on time. Good print.    Helen Parker  Cicero,Indiana
1577314808|1.0|I do not recommend it. Looks like he has taken many world religions and tried to mesh them all together to sound like a smart mans wisdom.<br />Falls short in many areas. Read the book twice to see if I was missing something. Do NOT waste your money if you have common seance. I gave it a 1 star because that was the lowest I could give.The book reads like a collage drop out on drugs trying to make a fast buck.<br />Read the real King James version of the Bible and you will understand that this book is HOG wash! If you think this book enlightens you than you scare us all And you are one of the spooky ones!
B001IAOEXU|4.0|First of all, I can't complain about the price!  Tossed these into an order with a few games and got the \\"FREE Super Saver Shipping,\\" so they cost me a whopping $4.99!  That's a shameless plug for Amazon, but they're one of the only vendors that ships to Afghanistan without issue, so they deserve it.  About the triggers: I have used these for a month now, and have played with them on Madden 08 (old school, I know), Red Dead Redemption, Dragon Age, and Metal Gear Solid 4.  To me, they make the controller feel much more natural in my hands.  My hands are now slightly more open, without my middle fingers needing to be curled up under the controller.  With my fingers in contact with the triggers, they aren't as flexed and tight as they would be without them, so when I have to snap off a trigger pull, it feels quicker and more natural to me.  I got used to the R2 button being the trigger for Read Dead Redemption, and it felt so normal I was extremely disappointed when MGS4 wouldn't let me re-map my controls to use the triggers more!  I am giving these a 4-star rating, nixing a star because they do pop off of the trigger if you pull them too hard or from an angle.  When this happens, your fingers are so confused as you try to find the controller triggers which now feel WAY underneath the controller!  They snap back into place easily, if you can find them, and I haven't risked putting Super Glue on them, yet...but it's a thought.  Great product.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|As you can read in other reviews posted here, there are obvious negatives with the dvd set. Be it the music changes or the lack of organization/episode guides. However, speaking personally of course, I think this dvd set is more than worthy of five stars.     A child of the early 90's, I have fond but hazy memories of staying up at night to watch Daria and I was absolutely elated when I began seeing episodes re-aired on the LOGO network this past year. My obsession with Daria and her Lawndale peers was immediately rekindled. It had never occurred to me until I began looking just how hard it was to find high quality episodes anywhere, and it appeared as if LOGO was only allotted certain episodes that I began to see multiple times. That is why I invested in this set. While yes, it is unfortunate that Viacom did replace most of the music in the series, I do have to agree with the statement on the back of the set. I am grateful just to have this collection at all. It has been long awaited and I think the few minor flaws and kinks definitely do not outweigh the major pro, which is having high quality episodes of one of MTV's best television series. And speaking from experience, this is one of the most reasonably priced television series sets that I have ever purchased. Worth every single penny, this is certainly a treasure that a die-hard Daria fan should not be without. Long live Daria!
B002RKSZKI|5.0|I love Jane Austen and Emma is one of her better works.  It was beautifully written and the characters jumped off the page.  Her books are so much better than the movie.
B003BVK2ZS|4.0|The subtitle aptly describes the premise, `The True Story of a Thief, a Detective and a World of Literary Obsession.' The main narrative is interesting and the book also functions as a memoir, as the author adds personal details related to books and collecting. She also includes several historical stories, mainly about book thieves and the obsession of collecting. I enjoyed her writing style, which is informative and conversational.    While I enjoyed this book, it didn't really stir emotion the way great books do. The story focuses mostly on the idiotic thief, who has delusions of grandeur, and the author's deep exploration of his motivation wasn't that meaningful or interesting to me. He's just a common thief who likes books. One of the bookstore owners thought the discussion of the thief's activities glorified him and I couldn't agree more. Looked at another way, the author is using this lunatic and is exploiting him for a good story and our benefit. As a result, the experience of reading this book is somewhat unsavory.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I love this game, can't wait for the update! It's a great way to kill time or procrastinate :) The graphics are better too
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Ooooh, I just HATE it when others have to put down a great book and try to stop others from getting into a truely great read.  Now, when I say great book and give it 5 stars, I'm not putting up there with the classics...those tried and true authors we've read since school.  NO, I'm saying it's a heck of a book and damned near impossible to put down after starting it.  I'm saying... don't be surprised that you get NOTHING done the day you start it, but finishing it.      My Word!!!  I wish I'd started it earlier in the day than I did, because I had to sit up late to finish it.  I'd give my last tooth to be able to come up with such an interesting premise and pull it off so well.  I love witches and vampires... Harry Potter... Twilight... and now this author's story.  You can bet your britches I'll try anything else she writes.    I was a LITTLE disappointed that it was the first in a series, as it wasn't sold as such (or I missed that part) as the ending was such a let down.  I was yelling \\"What Happened?\\" as it was ending and wanting to know...NOW!!!! What!!! Happened!!!???    Did they make it through time?   Did everyone, witch, daemon, vampire, human start getting along?  WAS THE BOOK FOUND????  I can't take this suspense!   I want the answers NOW!!!!!
B00127RAJY|4.0|I borrowed this DVD from a colleague at work after i told her i needed to lose weight and fast and only in a month's time. She suggested this workout DVD and I've been hooked ever since. The workouts are TOUGH and EFFECTIVE. I've been at it for 3wks now and have lost almost 10lbs! (in conjunction with changing my diet of course) I havent gotten beyond Level 2 as yet because its just that intense of a work out! I felt my body changing and adapting since Day 1. I will definitely recommend this DVD for anyone who wants results and fast. This is why im now on amazon trying to buy my own copy haha :)
B004Q1FDHO|5.0|Tons of fun and there was a surprisingly large amount of work put into this game! Lots to do and see and very well polished. Only exception is the memory management as the game occasionally lags or freezes. Definitely worth the download, though!
B004KPLVW2|5.0|It is great that they remastered the original 1982 TRON.  On an HDTV it is excellent to watch, smoother, and crisper.  Awesome movies for those sci-fi fans
B0000640SA|5.0|This collectors box is great condition! Definitely the coolest collectors edition box I own or seen. Especially if you have seen the film, then all the contents make more sense. A lot of neat stuff on the inside as well to make it all the more a great box
B004ECDNJU|1.0|No one is buying this junk. For the price you could get some real good rts or rpg games they have out there now and days. catching fireballs my lefty.
0307593525|5.0|I first purchased this set back in 1974 when I was setting up my first home with my new husband.  I purchased this set for my daughter as a house warming gift for her first household.  What can I say that has not already been said about this classic set of French cookbooks?  Even if you never make a recipe, you will learn so much about cooking and you can take that knowledge with you as you continue in the kitchen.  I recommend the two volume set in the box.  The box will protect the volumes from dust, etc. through the decades just like it has for mine.
B0047Y17P2|4.0|I'm a retired cop, and a decent investigator, so one of my primary criteria for liking a mystery is if I haven't solved the crime(s) halfway through the novel. (Stupid, unrealistic scenarios don't count!)<br />\\"The Fifth Witness\\" fully satisfied me in this and all other respects. I'm not going to rehash the plot here, but I will say that the timely relevance of the triggering situation added to both realism and authenticity.<br />I also like the interplay between Mickey Haller, his ex-wives, and also his half-brother Harry Bosch. It feels real, not contrived as a plot device.<br /><br />Finally (pun intended), I really liked the ending! It was eminently satisfying.
B004FOA84A|3.0|lots of fun, but way too short. I'm glad it was free - not because it was bad, but because it wasn't $0.99 worth of content in my opinion.<br /><br />For more of my game/app reviews, look! me up on Examiner.com, I always do an extensive review of the free app of the day
B00288KNLS|5.0|this is a wonderful movie. it has everything ur mind cud imagine!! beauty, and darkness all at once! the animation is great and u cud watch it over and over and over again!! the 2-disc collector's edition contains the movie in 2-D AND 3-D versions (flip the disc for a certain version), 4 pairs of 3-D glasses, an awesome slipcase, a digital copy of the movie (now expired), and a bonus disc ful of bonus features. if ur willing to spend a little more money for the extra bonus features and such, then i prefer this, but if ur not, then just purchase the single-disc version (which also contains 4 3-D glasses).
B004SS0884|5.0|although I thought the Blackout album was criminally underapprecitated, this one is at least as good IF YOU GET THE DELUXE version. Til the world ends and Hold it against me are purely producer mastery, but they bring their A game on these. You'll hear the same on Kesha and Enrique latest hits (World Ends = F***n You by Enrique Iglesias), but she shines here on songs that will never make the limited radio playlists. He About To Lose Me, Dont Keep Me Waiting are knockouts, I wanna Go and Inside Out  are slammin, and selfish, Trouble for me, and Seal It With A Kiss are great floor stormers. Now if we could just get her a little less like a dazed robot in her viedeos,.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|You will love this book!!! I loved all 3 books! After I read twilight I wanted something I would fall in love with just like that... This book did that! You can't put it down ;)

B004I4H8PO|2.0|I have been waiting for this box set for a while. Read the reviews and was worried about the warnings. Sure enough, went to a local store that just received three boxed sets and we checked out the contents together. First box had two disks dislodged and they had fallen inside the folder/page that housed the CDs.    Them must assemble and glue the page together then shove the CD inside before the glue dries. Two discs had lots of glue on the back. Really pathetic.     We then opened another boxed set ... two more discs had the same problem and two of the ticket replicas were badly wrinkled/crunched.     WTF ... how can a company design such an elaborate package, create the new discs which should sound wonderful, not to mention the vinyl LPs and nice book .... then have A-holes put the package together in such a shoddy manner. WTF ????    I purchased The Who Live at Leeds box set and the sleeve that held the 7\\" was sloppily connected as well ... basically not connected.     How hard is it to create packaging for customers that are paying a premium for all the extra glitter ???    I hope to have another try when the store brings in a few more sets.     PS. THE PICK GUARD STICKER SHOULD HAVE BEEN AN ACTUAL PICK GUARD. NO ONE WOULD PUT THAT PIECE OF GARBAGE ON A NICE STRATOCASTER.
B00479SVBU|5.0|Shipped in 2 Days! Didn't expect much at this price, but have been amazed! Bought to use on an older Electra-Glide, and couldn't be more pleased! Plugs right in to the dash lighter socket. Transmission clarity is great for the bike- just for fun, broadcast to my \\"garage \\" stereo - range turned out to be about 100 feet! A bit difficult to see in direct sunlight, but back-lighting at night works great!  Plan on playing with it for about an hour before you become totally familiar with the controls.Doesn't access Sub-Folders ( like if you want to put several albums of 1 artist in a master-folder), but is no problem if you load each album individually (will have its own folder). This is just Perfect for touring bikes without aux input. The quality and features of this unit are way above its price-point!
B004SKHJF2|4.0|It works great. I've been playing with it, and it even finds odd songs and tunes from background music. Works on Samsung Epic.
B004TTMYQG|3.0|I found it a little cumbersome at first but then I started to get used to it.  Now I use it regularly but I have not figured out how to back it up yet because it would be a pain losing the data and scheduling.
1440503257|4.0|This is really a great buy for all your Harry Potter fans who love to cook. There a few recipes that the ingredients might be difficult to find if you do not live near a specialty store. A lot of the names, of the dishes, are very amusing. There are facts about where the dish comes from and/or how it got its name. Can't wait to try some of them out. Too bad there is no recipe for butterbeer. Guess I'll have to wait until I go back to Universal Studios Orlando for that.
B004IQMXD4|5.0|It's been 10 years since Stevie Nicks last released an album, and it was well worth the wait! Her vocals are powerful and ageless, her intricate storytelling is enchanting, and the poetry is abundant and beautiful. \\"Secret Love\\" was written in 1976 and is about one of her rock star romances, but she coyly maintains she can't remember which one. The ballad \\"Italian Summer\\" is an over the top seduction, which climaxes in typical Nicks fashion: \\"Love was everywhere/You just had to fall.\\" \\"Moonlight (A Vampire's Dream)\\" was inspired by the Twilight series and sets a mysterious and gothic mood to perfection. \\"Annabel Lee\\" is a masterpiece tribute to Edgar Allen Poe; it's a 6 minute thesis on love and death that echoes the Fleetwood Mac classic \\"Dreams.\\" On \\"New Orleans\\" she recalls her eternal desire to \\"wear feathers and lace\\", while \\"Soldier's Angel\\" finds her intoning ominously about war. Overall the strength and sincerity of Nicks' songs make this just another reason to love and respect her, and I'd highly recommend this new collection of songs to anyone!!!
0810988232|3.0|Unfortunately, these new addition of cards was seriously not up to par.  I had read reviews on the flimsiness of the cards - but being a fan of the Faerie Oracle - I thought it was something I could work with.  The quality of the cards isn't great and I was a bit disappointed in just the overall \\"presentation\\".
B0041KKYEW|2.0|'Black Swan' received good reviews, but disappoints on watching.  I found Natalie Portman overacting each scene.  The story of a young, ambitious dancer losing touch with reality is fundamentally terrific, and I would have loved to see a decent rendition of it.  Measured against other movies with a similar theme, such as 'American Psycho' or the masterpiece 'Pi,' 'Black Swan' has little to offer.
B004TTMYQG|4.0|This app does a bunch of things that the native calendar app on Android doesn't do, which to me was worth it. Nice app. Could use more choices on the colors, thats my only picky issue.
1591841216|5.0|Pushing sixty and laid off from my last job of a decade made me put things into perspective. I started out at my last company (over a decade ago) able to be creative and resolve tense situations and technical snafus with total carte blanche. But due to several company merges, the last five years found my creativity shut down in lieu of taking direction (with no input allowed) for day to day operations. I turned my brain off and just waited as the layoffs got closer and closer to me. Now that I am free again, I found this book a great help in kick starting my brain. After reading it I decided I would take a \\"Roman Holiday\\" - just spend the summer doing what I want to do before I choose a \\"job\\" or \\"career\\" to go back to.<br /><br />I am taking all sorts of classes - music, writing, painting, investing (so I do not waste any money and do not stress out about having the summer off), meditation, tai chi.<br /><br />I read through this book once. Now I am taking a page a day, and journaling my own thoughts to what I have read. What I am finding out is that I am birthing a different person from a month ago, a year ago, a decade ago. And that new person will have something fun and wonderful to offer in the new work I choose that brings me joy.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book if you feel your creativity has abandoned you. Your mojo has not left you - it is just waiting for you to awaken it from a long nap and for you to start playing together again.
B004N44SOI|5.0|This Is Gonna Hurt is the soundtrack to compliment the book by the same name released about a month ago. First and foremost, this is an AMAZING album. The songs are well written, the lyrics deep and meaningful while also being twisted and dark, and the production is crisp and fresh. Nikki Sixx is the driving creative force behind most of the music, and he dives deep into meandering emotions through epic melodies. The result is an intriguing mix of sounds and passions. Words that come to mind when listening are raw and powerful. His music captures all of his creative qualities: his love, rage, optimism, darkness, and determinism. The title track is a great way to start off the album and features some killer bass playing. \\"Lies of the Beautiful\\" has catchy riffs and amazing vocals, and tackles contradictions in society with Sixx urging listeners to look beneath the skin. \\"Live Forever\\" delivers with a sonic boom and features an incredible guitar solo. \\"Sure Feels Right\\" is a stunning change to the overall sound: the guitar and bass are soothing and the vocals entwine perfectly with the music. \\"Skin\\" shows Nikki's deeper side and is a statement about beauty without prejudice. There is not one filler song on the album, and listening closely to the music and lyrics will definitely make you react, which is what I think Nikki had in mind. Highly recommended!!!
B004Q1FDHO|2.0|game is enjoyable to play but after several sessions it will slow down and then finally it will freeze my phone.  played this game all day yesturday and had to remove the battery from my phone about 5 times.  sucks.  will this get fixed anytime soon?  anyone?
B004G600A4|4.0|I bought this for my grandsons' viewing, but I really enjoyed it also.  They all enjoyed it -- three boys (!) ages 5, 7, 12.  It's a wonderful message of good triumphing over evil and the consequences of deceit and manipulation both to the instigator and the victim.  But never fear, the movie is delightful and entertaining while delivering its message.

0938045768|5.0|This is a classic bodyweight training manual. Moreover, it's different than any other you'll likely read. It's written in a colorful, easy reading style with no pretense.<br /><br />According to the author, an ex-convict, \\"The average gym junkie today is all about appearance, not ability. Flash, not function. These men may have big, artificially pumped up limbs, but all that the size is in the muscle tissue; their tendons and joints are weak. Ask the average muscleman to do a deep one-leg squat-ass-to-floorstyle-and his knee ligaments would probably snap in two. What strength most bodybuilders do have, they cannot use in a coordinated way; if you asked them to walk on their hands they'd fall flat on their faces.\\"<br /><br />This is an extraordinary book about functional bodyweight training. By functional I mean you are taught to be strong for everyday life -- not muscular for the sake of appearance.<br /><br />Like the author, I've seen beefy guys and gals at the gym walking ahead of me looking like they could hardly move because they had so much muscles on their legs. They walked like a fat person whose thighs rub against each other. Not a pretty sight.<br /><br />The author continues, \\"To become hugely powerful, you don't need weights, cables, fancy machines, or any other crap that the industry or the infomercials are brainwashing you into thinking you can't do without. You can gain Herculean strength-genuine brawn and vitality-with no special equipment at all. But to unlock this power-the power of your own body-you need to know how. You need the right method, the art.<br /><br />Such a method does in fact exist. It's based on traditional, ancient forms of training, techniques which are as old as training itself. This method has evolved by trial-and-error over the centuries, and has proved its superior ability to transform flimsy men into steel-forged warriors time and time again. This method is progressive calisthenics-the art of using the human body to maximize its own development. Calisthenics today is seen as a method of aerobics, circuit training or muscle endurance. It isn't taken seriously. But in the past-before the second half of the twentieth century-all of the world's strongest athletes earned the bulk of their power through performing calisthenics progressively-to become stronger and stronger, day by day, week by week, year after year.\\"<br /><br />He then teaches you, step by step, how to go from zero to elite with nothing but bodyweight. He says that the fitness industry promotes weights and other gadgets to make money.<br /><br />If you read the history of bodybuilding, you'll read how the Weider brothers and many before them made a good deal of wealth selling supplements and various types of muscle building equipment.<br /><br />On the other hand, people like Charles Atlas sold a simple bodyweight program that taught people to look and feel great using their own bodies. Of course, in all fairness, Atlas became rich too.<br /><br />Here are the contents:<br /><br />1. Introduction: A Journey of Strength<br />2.

One of the many things I like about it is that it starts the reader out at a very easy to perform exercise. One that's easy to do yet very effective. It takes you to very serious exercises in a way that really works --- by using progression.<br /><br />The book has lots of pictures in it with easy-to-understand instructions. It's not only fun to read but it's also very interesting. Not only for the knowledge of the exercises, but for the history it shares and the unique perspective of the author.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the author directs the book to men and makes no mention of training women. Perhaps that's understandable. But the training applies to women as well.<br /><br />A number of comments have been made in other reviews questioning whether or not the author is really an ex-convict. Well, it could be a marketing ploy. But there are many reasons an ex-con would not want to use his own name in writing this, or any, book.<br /><br />As to the British English that is used in some parts --- the editors are from Australia and perhaps some in the U.K. It's poor editing, of course, to put an American writer in British English. But it's done only in a few parts. It sounds like it's been edited by numerous people. If so, they didn't catch many misspellings that they should have.<br /><br />But to me, those are small issues. True -- a book as expensive as this one should be error-free. But we live in a world of poor editing. The value of this book is in the information.<br /><br />If you're interested in bodybuilding, fitness or bodyweight training, you need to add this book to your library. My guess is it's one you'll put to work right away and use often.<br /><br />You can continue with your weights if you want. The book doesn't say you should choose one over the other. But it's likely you'll develop a new respect for getting functional strength by using nothing but your own body, in your own time and totally on your own. And that's convict conditioning. It works for them. It will work for you.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />-- Susanna K.

B004IQMXD4|5.0|It is great to hear Stevie Nicks back making music.  She proves that she is still one of the best vocalists ever with this album. \\"In Your Dreams\\"  My favorite track is \\"You Might Be The One\\". This cut has a bluesy tone that I like. I love Stevie's subtle lyrics and the electric guitar playing on this track. \\"In Your Dreams\\" is an upbeat tune that puts me in a good mood.  \\"Secret Love\\" is a superb pop love song. \\"Wide Sagrasso Sea\\" is a song about a passionate but destruction relationship between a man and a woman. I don't know why Stevie gave this song this particular title, but I like the rock tone of this song.  For What It's Worth is a friendship song. Stevie conveys such warmth with the vocals of this song. \\"Annabell Lee\\" is a song based on my favorite poem by Edgar Allan Poe.  It is neat to hear the words of this poem set to music.  I love this song.  \\"Ghosts Are Gone\\" is a song that sends my pulse racing.  This is a rock song that pumps me up.  Dave Stewart lends his talents on a few songs.  \\"Everybody Loves You\\" is a song that makes me feel hopeful that I will find someone to love someday.  \\"Cheaper Than Free\\" is a  song about what feels like to be in love.  Their voices sound great together. \\"New Orleans\\" is a tribute song to a city that is filled with energy.  Her vocals really make  me want to visit New Orleans to join the fun. \\"Soldier's Angel\\"is a moving song for all the men and women who have served bravely in the military.  \\"Moonlight a Vampire's Dream\\" is an interesting song title.  I like the piano playing on this song very much.  This is the first vampire love song I have ever heard. I like the creative lyrics of this song. \\"Italian Summer\\" is a visually poetic song about the images of an Italian summer.  This song has a romantic tone that is pleasant to listen to. I absolutely love this new album from Stevie Nicks.
0345522478|4.0|It seems like an urban fantasy prerequisite these days for the protagonist to have a comic relief sidekick.  Harry Dresden has a possessed skull named Bob, Rachel Morgan has Jenks the pixie, and Atticus O'Sullivan has an Irish Wolfhound named Oberon.  Oberon, more than any of the other well drawn characters in Kevin Hearne's clever, Celtic mythology infused debut,  HOUNDED, was my favorite.  He thinks like a dog, but the way Hearne communicated those thoughts was endlessly entertaining.  He had a childlike enthusiasm that came across perfectly.<br /><br />Atticus too had a great `voice.'  He struck just right balance between witty modern vernacular with the occasional ancient colloquialism that it made him 100% believable as a millennial old Druid with the body of a twenty-one year old.  He had a laid back coolness factor that belied a razor sharp mind.  One of the best debut protagonists I've read in a long time.<br /><br />An Arizona girl myself, it was great fun to read a book literally set in my backyard.  I think I've been to every location mentioned in HOUNDED and can vouch for the grub at the Rula Bula Irish pub in Tempe.  At the same time, because I was so familiar with the setting, it was probably harder for me to wrap my head around the idea of all these supernatural creatures living in and around my old stomping grounds.<br /><br />But it wasn't the setting that kept HOUNDED from skyrocketing onto my all time favorites list, it was the plot.  It's pretty thin and takes it's sweet time getting started.  The first hundred pages or so deal primarily with Atticus getting unwanted visitors and introducing us to some of the characters who will no doubt populate the series.  An old enemy wants something that Atticus stole from him centuries ago.  He sends wave after wave of attackers after Atticus to get it back.  That's pretty much it.  If the characters and writing style hadn't been so compelling, the weak plot would have been a problem.<br />Overall, a really strong debut full of primary and secondary characters who could all probably carry a series on their own, they are that good.  The plot may not have been the strong suit, but the narrative style and voice of Atticus and Oberon more than made up for it.  If you like a sprawling pantheon along side the more traditional urban fantasy vampires, werewolves, and witches, you're going to love this book. The good news is that you won't have to wait the usual six months to a year for the next Iron Druid Chronicles book.  Del Rey is releasing the first three books back to back:  HOUNDED will come out May 3, HEXED on June 7, and HAMMERED on July 5. The fourth book in the series is called TRICKED, but does not yet have a release date.<br /><br />Sexual Content:<br />Kissing.

B000PMLFRA|1.0|We already know this is gonna be the same crap with probably even more \\"improvements\\"<br /><br />I will keep my bonus disc original versions from a few years back and have no plans to touch this.  I have given Lucasfilm enough money to put an African child or two, in clothing and school for life.  It's time to stop and there is why I draw the line.<br /><br />I can only imagine what Jar Jar Lucas is going to do to these versions.  Will there be more ships in the background?  More aliens in the background?  Louder sound effects? An appearance by Jar Jar stinks himself?  Who knows?  Who cares?  I don't.  I'm done.<br /><br />Don't even look at buying this release.  Just obey the stormtrooper and \\"move along.\\"
0525951652|5.0|I would love to review this book, however I have not recieved it to make any comments....<br />I am a big fan of Ken Follet and I'm sure the book is excellent.<br />And yes it was bought through a customer of Amazon.com
030726999X|4.0|How do you top the first two of this series?  Write a third - The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest does not disappoint.  Larsson's characters become people we know, some we like, some we hate.  I cheered throughout the third book for Lisbeth and Blomkvist and thoroughly enjoyed the sub-plots of the other characters.  Lisbeth is such a strong character and I love how she is able to dupe her enemies.  I particularly enjoyed reading about Lisbeth's relationship with Dr. Jonasson and was glad to have him on her side.<br /><br />I also enjoyed the Gullberg/Clinton \\"Special Section\\" subplot and think Larsson does a great job portraying these \\"old timers.\\"  Despite their illegal activities, they are professionals in what they do and that is impressive.  In addition, I think Erica Berger's problems are both interesting and suspenseful and like that she becomes a key character in this book.<br /><br />As with the first two books, I think the hi-tech element is totally entertaining and fun to read.<br /><br />One thing that doesn't quite sit with me is Blomkvist's relationship with Figuerola.  I think when you read this series, there are a lot of things you must simply believe for the sake of the story, but for some reason, I do not see the connection between these two.  I guess that can also be said about Blomkvist's brief affair with Harriett Vanger in the second book and with the other Vanger cousin in the first book.  Despite Blomkvist's and Figuerola's relationship, I started to cheer for Berger, hoping she and Blomkvist would somehow stay connected.<br /><br />I am sad this series is finished!
B000LBBLO2|1.0|I order the Superman Returns- Widescreen 2 DVD set ( W/ Exclusive 3D Cover 30 Minute 1940s Radio Episodes), and what I received was a 2 Disc Special Edition, this did not include a 3D Cover. So this was not what I had ordered, now I did not notice this until after I had opened the item so I could not return it, but this should have not been an issue. So buyers beware from this seller you may not get what you've oedered.

The graphics were good and the puzzles were clever (the lights coming out of the well stumped me for awhile), but the game is way too short.

0812550706|5.0|I found Ender's Game to be an extremely intriguing story with many things to offer a reader. The book is in many ways, perfect for all types of audience and satisfies the wants of most. The gripping plot and creative description of future earth are what immediately pulls you in. It is after this that the many textures of the novel are noticed. The first of these levels being the immense usage of science fiction that would please anyone between a fascinated child to an intelligent adult. For those that are not as interested in that aspect of the book should notice the well used themes and character representations within the book. The story discusses the moral restraints and faults of many characters, as well as using the government and military of earth as a whole to display this message. The protagonist, Ender is forced to continuously choose between violence and peace, as well as control and impulse. It is displayed throughout the book that humanity dwells within Ender, but it is the preservation of it that becomes a challenge. All in all, the book was extremely enjoyable and it is my belief that a reader from almost any demographic of interest would agree.
B002ZG975Q|5.0|I saw the movie before I read the book, but after reading the book, I still stand by what I said after seeing the movie. I loved it and insisted that my grandmother (84) and my aunt (52) go see it. The movie is different from the book, I don't deny that, but if you love, love stories and the classic tale of Beauty and the Beast, than this is the perfect movie for you!
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I love the series CASTLE but missed some of the first season---I was so glad to get the DVD of the first season.  This series has everything---great characters, wonderful interplay, super acting, interesting plots.  Great fun to watch during the many times nothing but inane reality series and reruns are clogging up the channels. Reality shows are for idiots as far as I am concerned, and they are poorly contrived.  If I want reality, I will look at the gang members hanging out on the corners. I watch TV for wit, interesting plots, good acting---I miss Murder, She Wrote, Perry Mason, the class dramas.  Thank goodness for Masterpiece Theater Mystery, Blue Bloods, Leverage, the Closer, NCIS----they keep me from cancelling my TV.

0061998494|4.0|Even though he's a bit older than me, I grew up in the same part of Scotland at around the same time as Craig Fergusson so the beginning of the book struck quite a few chords with me.  I also emigrated to the USA from Scotland and became \\" American on Purpose\\".  So I found much of the book very easy to relate to. I found his early years and school days hilarious and so true. the later years were pretty interesting too although thankfully I didn't relate to his drug and alcohol addiction years personally. On the whole an interesting, honest and very funny memoir.
B004X0Y5GI|5.0|Once again Stevie Nicks proves why she is the Queen of Rock. This cd is some of her best work since The Wild Heart. Ever so often two souls come together that work in perfection and Dave Stewart and Stevie Nicks have done just that. This is a great effort by both. If you listen to just the little snipets of music provided you will not get the full effect of this cd. This cd must be listened to from beginning to end, again and again, and again and again.
0062073559|5.0|Death on the Nile was published in London in 1937. It is one of Dame Agatha Christie's most famous and enduring masterpieces of detective fiction. The plot is complicated, the characters memorable and the genius of Hercule Poirot are much in evidence in this page turning \\"whodunit.\\"<br />  The early chapters provide background information on the main characters who are:<br />Linnet Ridgeway Doyle-Rich, beautiful and spoiled she ditches her aristocratic boyfriend Lord Windelsham. Instead she weds Simon Doyle the fiance of her best friend Jackie de Bellfort. All three of these characters are passengers on the \\"Karnack\\"<br />a small river steamship that takes them on a tour to death on the fabled Nile River. Hercule Poirot is also a passenger on this boat. Linnet is found murdered and soon after two more passengers are also homicide victims (all three murdered persons are women;two are shot dead and a third victim is stabbed. Colonel John Race and his more brilliant detective friend Hercule Poirot (retired from the Belgian Police force) are charged with solving the crimes. fyou are like this reviewer everyone interviewed by Poirot sees like he or she is the foul murderer!<br />  There are several plot twists, colorful characters, witty dialogue and exotic locales to make this one of Dame Christie's best books1 So find a comfy armchair, brew a cup of tea and enjoy a few hours with the renowned Poriot!
B004YNWBZG|1.0|I'm really getting sick of this... ok, BACK to the alternate dimension again... now BACK to the Phantom Zone - what's next? Back to high school? WHEN IS HE GOING TO FLY????? I'm sick and tired of a \\"conflicted\\" and self-doubting Superman. This is getting really old.
B004UC1WN8|3.0|Jennifer has said in loads of interviews over the years that she doesn't like being referred to as J.Lo any more as that was just a character, but lo and behold - J.Lo is back. Literally back; J.Lo is stamped on the album and single covers instead o her name. A glance in the booklet is the same old checklist; fur coat? Check. Bling? Check. Barely there clothing? Check. Glossy hair? Check.<br /><br />So with the artwork being blasts from the past the question becomes, will the actual album be a look back over her back catalogue too?<br /><br />LOVE? boasts an impressive list of song writers, which includes the likes of Lady GaGa, RedOne, Evan \\"Kidd\\" Boggart, Jorgen Elofsson, Diana Gordon, Taio Cruz, Tammar Chin, Claude Kelly and Aliaune Thiam.<br /><br />Even though Jennifer Lopez has publicly stated that this is her most personal album it is worth noting that she has only co-wrote two songs; One Love and Villain.<br /><br />On The Floor [feat. Pitbull]<br /><br />[Contains a sample of Los Kjarkas song Llorando Se Fue, which is popularly known for being used in the Kaoma single Lambada]<br /><br />Since Jennifer's last collaboration with Pitbull went so well [Fresh Out The Oven] it was only natural that she would team up with him again. The result sounds like her old On The 6 singles and it was meant to; Jennifer asked writer/producer Redone to come up with a track that was the evolution of her classic sound and the lead single was the result. Lyrically it's follows a basic 'get down and boogie' formula, but the r&b/pop/Latin/Lambada music screams summer, so this is a very appealing song. I didn't like it at first, but once you hear it it takes root in your head and you'll be humming it for months.<br /><br />Good Hit<br /><br />I view this as a filler; it's not bad and it's not something that I tend to skip, but there's nothing here that hooks me in.<br /><br />It's a empty pop/r&b driven song, with uninspired lyrics about how hot she is, so don't you wish that she was yours? I've listened to it many times to review and I still can't think of anything worth adding to this description, it's just meaningless noise.<br /><br />I'm Into You [feat. Lil Wayne]<br /><br />Apparently Lil Wayne is Jennifer's favourite male rapper, so she asked him to feature on this Taio Cruz written track.<br /><br />The song isn't too complicated or anything; Jennifer's lines are mainly about being into the attraction of her partner, whilst Lil Wayne mostly hangs in the background and just adds nudge nudge, wink wink quips. This is another track that I wasn't keen on at first, but the music once again seems happy and summery, which coupled with repetitive vocals means it will grow on you.<br /><br />(What Is) LOVE?<br /><br />[Appeared the soundtrack to The Backup Plan]<br /><br />This was one of the first songs to leak a few years ago and I still love it. The song is about not knowing what love is and the writers say that they drew inspiration from tales from women with \\"no fathers, families, abusive boyfriends and husbands... no parental support, they feel alone\\". Now I'm not classing Jennifer Lopez in with these tough survivors, but she does channel the emotions of loneliness and quiet sadness in the lyrics.<br /><br />The only thing that I was slightly disappointed with was that the track hasn't been remixed for the album; it's same as it was when it was first leaked.<br /><br />Run The World<br /><br />This comes very close to being a filler; bland lyrics telling someone that Jennifer will always be by their side. Music-wise it reminds me of a pop/r&b J.Lo era song [with a touch of Rebirth's Hold You Down thrown in] and it's annoying me that I can't remember which one.<br /><br />The rapper is Rick Ross. Doesn't mean anything to me, but it might to other people. He doesn't actually do much here, so he doesn't earn a 'featuring' tag.<br /><br />Papi<br /><br />Placing this track next to another bland track was a mistake as this is another ho-humtrack, which again lyrically tells us about how great she is [a super lady]. Yeah; hearing the title I was expecting a attitude laden track attacking the tabloids, but instead it's papi as in the slang term for a hot guy. So once again it's dancing + guys = we get a load of nothing.<br /><br />But the music comes to the rescue and makes up for the empty lyrics; it's another summery r&b/pop/Latin upbeat number, so it could do well as a single.<br /><br />Until It Beats No More<br /><br />The lyrics of this ballad reminds me slightly of Ain't It Funny [obviously the original version, not the Murder Inc remix] and Alive, plus it is also reminiscent of (What Is) Love? Basically Jennifer's through with being hurt in love, but just when she's thrown in the towel along comes her knight in shining armour.<br /><br />There's no doubt that Jennifer's vocals have grown, but she just isn't vocally suited to ballads; you can hear the strain as she gamely attempts the high notes. Even if she had the voice of Mariah Carey I probably still wouldn't take mega-bling, 3 hubbies J.Lo's attempts at soul searching and declarations of undying love terribly seriously.<br /><br />One Love<br /><br />This is very similar to (What Is) Love; this track is telling us about Jennifer's search for love. I get the references to P Diddy, Ben Affleck and Marc Anthony, but all I can think is what about hubbies one and two (or maybe he is 'round two')?<br /><br />It's another snooze fest musically - part Run The World, part (What Is) Love, but not as good as either - and remember that I don't love Run The World. It wouldn't be as noticeable if they'd took inspiration from tracks from an earlier album, but no, they take it from two tracks from the same album.<br /><br />Invading My Mind<br /><br />This is a Lady GaGa/RedOne track, so has dancier electro beats. I naturally wanted to love it, but it is just a weaker version of Just Dance.<br /><br />The listener is one more reminded that Jennifer is hot, but for a change we hear about how great some one she meets is and how much the sparks fly between them. Sadly this is another track that I can't think of anything valid to add.<br /><br />Villain<br /><br />This is another favourite of mine; Jennifer sings about being the one to end a relationship that wasn't working and so being made out to be a cold villain because of it. I may not be able to take Jennifer's slow songs seriously, but I can hear the sincerity it her voice on this track.<br /><br />The lyrics may seem heartfelt, but the music is electro/r&b, to keep the track upbeat and being all 'poor me, I'm the real victim'.<br /><br />Starting Over<br /><br />This is another heartfelt vocal. Jennifer says that she is in love with her partner, but deep down she knows the relationship isn't working, yet she is scared to end it and being back to square one. Not bad, but it's really just a mishmash of other album tracks.<br /><br />It is lyrically a ballad, but I don't think the music is slow enough and it had an annoying synth beat that drowns out the piano and strings.<br /><br />Hypnotico<br /><br />Another Lady GaGa/RedOne track, another track that I wanted to love - but don't. Musically the electro pop/dance beat is stronger than Invading My Mind, but lyrically I'm still not sure what exactly it's about,; dancing in a club, whilst the men all drool over her I think.<br /><br />The music just about saves the track from being labelled as a filler, but I once again wanted/expected more from this track, considering the writers/producers.<br /><br />None of the extra tracks are worth indulging in the deluxe version of the album for. They're all poppy fluff, with no meaningful lyrical content. There's nothing that is out and out 'bad' and skippable, but there is nothing good on offer either.<br /><br />13. Everybody's Girl<br /><br />This is another track that leaked a few years ago.<br /><br />Jennifer wants to know if her man is able to cope with her under the glare of the spotlight and still love her, knowing that she is viewed as belonging to the public?<br /><br />14. Charge Me Up<br /><br />Another RedOne track, yet another letdown.<br /><br />Once again we get another dance + cute guy = sparks electro driven pop/dance number. Writing that sentance nearly sent me to sleep.<br /><br />15. Take Care<br /><br />[This track is supposed to interpolate and contain elements from both Rude Boy and I Like It, but I don't hear either]<br /><br />Jenifer loves her man, she really loves and needs him. The lyrics are way too repetitive - it goes straight past catchy, to f***ing annoying, play-it-again-and-I-will-kill-you.<br /><br />16. On The Floor (Ven a Bailar) [feat. Pitbull]<br /><br />No prizes for guessing that this is the Spanish version of On The Floor.<br /><br />On the plus side: LOVE? mixes R&B, dance and pop, with a ballad thrown in, so there is variety in music styles and there will be something on LOVE? to appeal to most pop music lovers.<br /><br />Plus; there has been continual growth on Jennifer's vocals - you can clearly recognize the improvement on every new album she releases. Whilst it's true that she does audibly strain her vocals and slightly tremor because she tries to stretch herself too far on Until It Beats No More, on every other track she does have greatly improved vocals - compared to her earlier work - when she stays with what styles suit her.<br /><br />How well you think everything all comes together ultimately on LOVE? depends on how big of a Jennifer Lopez fan you are - the more casual fan will ultimately be a little disappointed by how heavily she has borrowed from past albums and topped up the albums running time with limp, lifeless tracks. Bigger fans will doubtlessly love the retro feel to the tracks and hail LOVE? a successful return to form for her.<br /><br />Although LOVE? is more solid then her past albums given the fact that I don't feel the need to skip over any of the tracks [bare in mind that the slower songs were performed on American TV and her tour a few years ago and several other tracks have been floating around on the net for over two years now], I'm still underwhelmed by the album in general as she doesn't offer anything new for the listener - she is playing it too safe.<br /><br />Several tracks are bland and uninspired and everything feels dated, even the new tracks. I look back at her old albums and automatically place everything together on them - there's a huge dollop of her Brave era stuff here and everything else has been heavily influenced by her successful J.Lo alter-ego and rent-a-rapper from her lucrative J.Lo/J To Da Lo period.<br /><br />I'm trying to think of which tracks would make good single releases and I've just found out that the two I singled out - (What Is) Love and Papi - were released on U.S. Itunes ahead of the album to try and create a buzz. So now I'd guess on them following up I'm Into You with one or both of the Lady GaGa penned tracks to try to appeal to the GaGa fans too, but whilst I'm a huge GaGa fan I have to admit that they both are below GaGa's usual standard - no wonder she gave the songs away rather then record them herself. As things stand I think that if there are any more singles released she'll hire more rent-a-rapper's to mix up them up, as I can't see any strong contenders on LOVE? at the minute.<br /><br />Based on LOVE? I'd say that there is definitely room for improvement in her [just musical?] career. She's not evolving, she's taking steps back. I think that she should have stuck to the original plan of releasing a Greatest Hits collection with one or two new tracks - she doesn't have enough new single worthy tracks to attempt a new album and I doubt LOVE? will set the charts alight as a result.This is another favourite of mine; Jennifer sings about being the one to end a relationship that wasn't working and so being made out to be a cold villain because of it. I may not be able to take Jennifer's slow songs seriously, but I can hear the sincerity it her voice on this track.

Although LOVE? is more solid then her past albums given the fact that I don't feel the need to skip over any of the tracks [bare in mind that the slower songs were performed on American TV and her tour a few years ago and several other tracks have been floating around on the net for over two years now], I'm still underwhelmed by the album in general as she doesn't offer anything new for the listener - she is playing it too safe.     Several tracks are bland and uninspired and everything feels dated, even the new tracks. I look back at her old albums and automatically place everything together on them - there's a huge dollop of her Brave era stuff here and everything else has been heavily influenced by her successful J.Lo alter-ego and rent-a-rapper from her lucrative J.Lo/J To Da Lo period.     I'm trying to think of which tracks would make good single releases and I've just found out that the two I singled out - (What Is) Love and Papi - were released on U.S. Itunes ahead of the album to try and create a buzz. So now I'd guess on them following up I'm Into You with one or both of the Lady GaGa penned tracks to try to appeal to the GaGa fans too, but whilst I'm a huge GaGa fan I have to admit that they both are below GaGa's usual standard - no wonder she gave the songs away rather then record them herself. As things stand I think that if there are any more singles released she'll hire more rent-a-rapper's to mix up them up, as I can't see any strong contenders on LOVE? at the minute.       Based on LOVE? I'd say that there is definitely room for improvement in her [just musical?] career. She's not evolving, she's taking steps back. I think that she should have stuck to the original plan of releasing a Greatest Hits collection with one or two new tracks - she doesn't have enough new single worthy tracks to attempt a new album and I doubt LOVE? will set the charts alight as a result.
B000059MEK|5.0|When I purchased this CD I was practically buying it for Harder,Better,Faster,Stronger. When I received the CD, I listened through the whole thing and decided that I couldn't give a 3-Star to any of the tracks(other than Too Long). They really are all great songs, even though you may not recognize them all. For instance my new favorite track is Something About Us and I had never heard it before I bought this CD. My experiences aside, I am sure you'll love this track if you like Daft Punk.
B0000064TT|4.0|the what if cd,what can i say it's a excellent album fusion music,different styles,,and the musician on the cd is talented,i'll reconmend anybody to give it a listen.
B004KSQN7C|5.0|In 10th grade when I first heard Britney Spears, I would have never thought someday I would be buying her album.  Like me, Britney has grown up and made a fun CD with a great collection of dance music that is great for driving or a motivational moment.  At least 7 excellent songs here for your listening pleasure!
B0042RUMH8|3.0|Jennifer has said in loads of interviews over the years that she doesn't like being referred to as J.Lo any more as that was just a character, but lo and behold - J.Lo is back. Literally back; J.Lo is stamped on the album and single covers instead o her name. A glance in the booklet is the same old checklist; fur coat? Check. Bling? Check. Barely there clothing? Check. Glossy hair? Check.<br /><br />So with the artwork being blasts from the past the question becomes, will the actual album be a look back over her back catalogue too?<br /><br />LOVE? boasts an impressive list of song writers, which includes the likes of Lady GaGa, RedOne, Evan \\"Kidd\\" Boggart, Jorgen Elofsson, Diana Gordon, Taio Cruz, Tammar Chin, Claude Kelly and Aliaune Thiam.<br /><br />Even though Jennifer Lopez has publicly stated that this is her most personal album it is worth noting that she has only co-wrote two songs; One Love and Villain.<br /><br />On The Floor [feat. Pitbull]<br /><br />[Contains a sample of Los Kjarkas song Llorando Se Fue, which is popularly known for being used in the Kaoma single Lambada]<br /><br />Since Jennifer's last collaboration with Pitbull went so well [Fresh Out The Oven] it was only natural that she would team up with him again. The result sounds like her old On The 6 singles and it was meant to; Jennifer asked writer/producer Redone to come up with a track that was the evolution of her classic sound and the lead single was the result. Lyrically it's follows a basic 'get down and boogie' formula, but the r&b/pop/Latin/Lambada music screams summer, so this is a very appealing song. I didn't like it at first, but once you hear it it takes root in your head and you'll be humming it for months.<br /><br />Good Hit<br /><br />I view this as a filler; it's not bad and it's not something that I tend to skip, but there's nothing here that hooks me in.<br /><br />It's a empty pop/r&b driven song, with uninspired lyrics about how hot she is, so don't you wish that she was yours? I've listened to it many times to review and I still can't think of anything worth adding to this description, it's just meaningless noise.<br /><br />I'm Into You [feat. Lil Wayne]<br /><br />Apparently Lil Wayne is Jennifer's favourite male rapper, so she asked him to feature on this Taio Cruz written track.<br /><br />The song isn't too complicated or anything; Jennifer's lines are mainly about being into the attraction of her partner, whilst Lil Wayne mostly hangs in the background and just adds nudge nudge, wink wink quips. This is another track that I wasn't keen on at first, but the music once again seems happy and summery, which coupled with repetitive vocals means it will grow on you.<br /><br />(What Is) LOVE?<br /><br />[Appeared the soundtrack to The Backup Plan]<br /><br />This was one of the first songs to leak a few years ago and I still love it. The song is about not knowing what love is and the writers say that they drew inspiration from tales from women with \\"no fathers, families, abusive boyfriends and husbands... no parental support, they feel alone\\". Now I'm not classing Jennifer Lopez in with these tough survivors, but she does channel the emotions of loneliness and quiet sadness in the lyrics.<br /><br />The only thing that I was slightly disappointed with was that the track hasn't been remixed for the album; it's same as it was when it was first leaked.<br /><br />Run The World<br /><br />This comes very close to being a filler; bland lyrics telling someone that Jennifer will always be by their side. Music-wise it reminds me of a pop/r&b J.Lo era song [with a touch of Rebirth's Hold You Down thrown in] and it's annoying me that I can't remember which one.<br /><br />The rapper is Rick Ross. Doesn't mean anything to me, but it might to other people. He doesn't actually do much here, so he doesn't earn a 'featuring' tag.<br /><br />Papi<br /><br />Placing this track next to another bland track was a mistake as this is another ho-humtrack, which again lyrically tells us about how great she is [a super lady]. Yeah; hearing the title I was expecting a attitude laden track attacking the tabloids, but instead it's papi as in the slang term for a hot guy. So once again it's dancing + guys = we get a load of nothing.<br /><br />But the music comes to the rescue and makes up for the empty lyrics; it's another summery r&b/pop/Latin upbeat number, so it could do well as a single.<br /><br />Until It Beats No More<br /><br />The lyrics of this ballad reminds me slightly of Ain't It Funny [obviously the original version, not the Murder Inc remix] and Alive, plus it is also reminiscent of (What Is) Love? Basically Jennifer's through with being hurt in love, but just when she's thrown in the towel along comes her knight in shining armour.<br /><br />There's no doubt that Jennifer's vocals have grown, but she just isn't vocally suited to ballads; you can hear the strain as she gamely attempts the high notes. Even if she had the voice of Mariah Carey I probably still wouldn't take mega-bling, 3 hubbies J.Lo's attempts at soul searching and declarations of undying love terribly seriously.<br /><br />One Love<br /><br />This is very similar to (What Is) Love; this track is telling us about Jennifer's search for love. I get the references to P Diddy, Ben Affleck and Marc Anthony, but all I can think is what about hubbies one and two (or maybe he is 'round two')?<br /><br />It's another snooze fest musically - part Run The World, part (What Is) Love, but not as good as either - and remember that I don't love Run The World. It wouldn't be as noticeable if they'd took inspiration from tracks from an earlier album, but no, they take it from two tracks from the same album.<br /><br />Invading My Mind<br /><br />This is a Lady GaGa/RedOne track, so has dancier electro beats. I naturally wanted to love it, but it is just a weaker version of Just Dance.<br /><br />The listener is one more reminded that Jennifer is hot, but for a change we hear about how great some one she meets is and how much the sparks fly between them. Sadly this is another track that I can't think of anything valid to add.<br /><br />Villain<br /><br />This is another favourite of mine; Jennifer sings about being the one to end a relationship that wasn't working and so being made out to be a cold villain because of it. I may not be able to take Jennifer's slow songs seriously, but I can hear the sincerity it her voice on this track.<br /><br />The lyrics may seem heartfelt, but the music is electro/r&b, to keep the track upbeat and being all 'poor me, I'm the real victim'.<br /><br />Starting Over<br /><br />This is another heartfelt vocal. Jennifer says that she is in love with her partner, but deep down she knows the relationship isn't working, yet she is scared to end it and being back to square one. Not bad, but it's really just a mishmash of other album tracks.<br /><br />It is lyrically a ballad, but I don't think the music is slow enough and it had an annoying synth beat that drowns out the piano and strings.<br /><br />Hypnotico<br /><br />Another Lady GaGa/RedOne track, another track that I wanted to love - but don't. Musically the electro pop/dance beat is stronger than Invading My Mind, but lyrically I'm still not sure what exactly it's about,; dancing in a club, whilst the men all drool over her I think.<br /><br />The music just about saves the track from being labelled as a filler, but I once again wanted/expected more from this track, considering the writers/producers.<br /><br />On the plus side: LOVE? mixes R&B, dance and pop, with a ballad thrown in, so there is variety in music styles and there will be something on LOVE? to appeal to most pop music lovers.<br /><br />Plus; there has been continual growth on Jennifer's vocals - you can clearly recognize the improvement on every new album she releases. Whilst it's true that she does audibly strain her vocals and slightly tremor because she tries to stretch herself too far on Until It Beats No More, on every other track she does have greatly improved vocals - compared to her earlier work - when she stays with what styles suit her.<br /><br />How well you think everything all comes together ultimately on LOVE? depends on how big of a Jennifer Lopez fan you are - the more casual fan will ultimately be a little disappointed by how heavily she has borrowed from past albums and topped up the albums running time with limp, lifeless tracks.

B004EBT5CU|5.0|I bought this CD based on word of mouth. It is SO GOOD!  Hard to believe she is only 21. Rolling in the Deep is probably my favorite, but Rumors is close behind...actually, I love them all.    You will not be unhappy if you love strong, bluesy music performed by someone with soul.
B004Q1FDHO|4.0|I didnt think this game would be as good as it is. Very surprising, very fun...even if it is a bit repetative.
6300181456|5.0|This movie is so great. It's fantastic to find someone who is selling it. Though the box is a little worn, that's to be expected.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|It's very rare for an artist to come out with an album that impacts you through lyrics AND music ... Adele has accomplished this.  I love every song on this cd and would recommend this to everyone.
B004132I20|5.0|This is a wonderful adaptation of the Sherlock Holmes series. From the mind of the current series of Doctor Who, we are brought to another level of mystery when introduced to the world of Sherlock. Every minute of these episodes (of which each is the length of a movie, 90 minutes) we are given wonderful character development and mind-boggling cases that leave you wanting more. This is a must for all people!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|where is may !!! I can't play it anymore I need may levels now please hurry wtf I need to type twenty words
0316056863|5.0|I don't really have anything different to add to other reviews... but I've never had the inclination to really urge anyone and everyone to buy a book.  Everyone who likes Tina Fey should buy this book, and I guarantee you'll enjoy reading it.  It's a delightful fast read, and like someone else mentioned, my husband was NOT amused when I kept laughing out loud and disturbing HIS silent reading :D
B004LL1HM4|4.0|Fleet Foxes return with more of their acoustic Folky sound laced with celestial harmonies on their sophomore set \\"Helplessness Blues\\".<br /><br />It's tough to pick standout tracks in an album of highlights, but special mention must be made of the tempo-shifting \\"The Plains / Bitter Dancer\\" (with its Simon & Garfunkel-ish first half), the lovely instrumental \\"The Cascades\\" (with tumbling guitars and a medieval feel), the waltzing \\"Lorelai\\", the hugely melodic acoustic \\"Someone You'd Admire\\", or the epic multi-part \\"The Shrine / An Argument\\" which ends in a flurry of disjointed-sounding horns and strings.<br /><br />The questioning \\"Blue Spotted Tail\\" finds lead singer Robin Pecknold asking \\"Why is the Earth moving round the sun? Why is life made only for it to end?\\" over delicately strummed guitar. Closing with thumping beats is the swelling \\"Grown Ocean\\".<br /><br />Magical and mysterious!
B004GHNHVW|3.0|Previous reviews have more than adequately analyzed this work, so without going into too much depth, I'll just say this--I did not think Paul Simon was capable of making a boring album, let alone a bad one.  Challenging at times, but always memorable and almost always listenable from start to finish, his work has always been full of effort and ultimately satisfying.  Unlike many of you, \\"Graceland\\" is not my favorite of his (though its staying power is a matter of record).  I thought \\"Rhythm of the Saints\\" and \\"Surprise\\" were perfect or near perfect albums, and they feel fresh to this day.  I have listened to this new one three times now, and it just doesn't do it for me at all.  I get the senior citizen spiritual re-awakening and all, having gone through it myself, but I'll listen to Ron Sexsmith's albums if I want to experience that.  It isn't that I feel he dialed this one in--that's hardly the case--but when Simon is running out of musical ideas because he's broken the mold so many times, I guess the bar was due to be set a little too high for even himself.  I hope this is not his last album.
0345529057|5.0|I'm just reviewing the book quality and not the stories.  I was a little nervous to order this set due to a bad review saying the pages were like newspaper.  The books are normal mass produced paperback quality and are fine.  I'm almost all the way through the first book and it's held up great and no pages have ripped.  All my books have all the right pages in them too.  I'm very pleased with this set especially for the price I paid.  It would have been much more expensive to buy these seperately.
B003Y58CKS|5.0|I have seen many Rigolettos at the Met, and Leonard Warren was to me the consummate jester.  However, I have never heard a cast so completely perfect as the one on this DVD.  Have given copies to my opera friends, and they all agree it is the best cast ever. SO believable--the arrogant Duke with looks to match, the divine Gilda, the incredible jester, and an amazing Sparafucile, have give me hours of pleasure.
B002V091IO|5.0|I was hooked from the first sentence.   I saw the ending coming from the nostalgic tone of the novel, no matter what point of their lives the story was zooming into. So beautiful, piercing, haunting is what my human inadequacy of words can manage to come up with. Beautiful. And I cried my eyeballs out at the end, in fact my eyes are maddeningly red and swollen from so much crying right now. Just loved it.
B0009HLD0K|5.0|This is the epitome of a small budget, high quality story.    Having come of age in a small Midwestern town at the time this movie was released, I immediately related to the characters and setting at once. That being said, my teenage sons also count this movie among their favorites and will pull it out to watch alone or with me.    All of the central characters, with the exception of the stereotypical jock/frat boys, were realistic with real depth without over-dramatization.     Favorite scenes - the bicycle training run on the highway, the talk on the bench at the university, and the climactic bike race. Although the ending may have been predictable, I am fascinated each time I watch as the end of the race plays out in a single uncut scene. It really puts you at the scene and makes you not just an observer but a part of the moment.    I own one copy now, but will make sure that my boys will each have a copy when they set out on their own. Maybe they will see a little of me in the fumbling but loving Dad on the screen. :^)
B004TTMYQG|5.0|This calendar is way better than the stock android calendar that came with my galaxy s. Looks a lot like the online google calendar and is much easier to customize and to use than the one that came with the phone.
B004FRX0MY|2.0|I love the Cloud Drive and Cloud Player. Frankly I had this app frozen on my rooted Droid 2 until Amazon came out with Cloud Player. Now I have a ton of music online and use this player almost exclusively.<br /><br />The main complaint I have is that the Player doesnt remember where I was the last time I ran it. This is a big issue when trying to listen to audio books. Everytime I close the program for a second (hit the home key or switch tasks) I have to remember where I was in the current track. And then when I reopen I (many times) have to scroll to find my album, the tack then click cose to where I was. It is just too hard. Save the last location and I give this a 5 star.<br /><br />UPDATE: When Amazon enacted their limits to songs/ storage or purchase this year I deleted it. Storage is so very cheap now (especially for Amazon, who doesn't have to actually store each song, but only a marker saying we have access to the song) and there are so many competitors (Google Play Music, for instance) I can't justify using this app. I downloaded all my songs (which took almost a day!) then deleted. You've lost me, Amazon MP3, until you give back unlimited storage.
0307593495|5.0|Henning Mankell's writings are the best.  He has taken crime novels to a new level.  Not only do we get perspective on the life of a police detective, but we are given insights into the problems of modern Swedish society and ultimately our own.  This is a wonderful book and I am going to miss Kurt Wallander as Henning Mankell has said this is the last one.      Thank you Amazon for providing a great book at a great price.  At Barnes and Noble, I would have paid double!
B000001G5H|5.0|I am out-of-date on concert pianists, so I took a chance that a Deutsche Grammophon recording would not disappoint. Chopin, in general, is a favourite of mine, but I was particularly interested in hearing Opus 25, No.1 in A-flat major which, for reasons strange and unknown, was new to me--often called \\"The Harp Etude.\\" The pianist, as one might expect, \\"does the work,\\" while the harp carries the melody. The harpist seems to be unamed, but I have since gathered that Maurizio Pollini won international acclaim for his rendition of these Etudes. In any case, I am very happy with my choice.
0061537969|5.0|I read this book in 3 days, I couldnt put it down!  I loved it.  I found the plotline to be made so unique when told through the eyes of the family dog.  Thats part of what drew me in.  I am an animal lover, but even if I hadnt been, I feel I still would have enjoyed this book very much.  I fell in love with Enzo and the story of his family.  I was heartbroken for the trials that Denny must endure.  Now that I have finished this book, when I look at dogs and even cats, I feel a little bit different.  I almost wonder... :-)    Excellent book though, highly recommend it.  Its a book with suspense, it hooks you and holds your interest, it also has humor and laughter and even though its a sad book, its also a wonderful book.  I loved the ending.  Read this book for sure.

B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|Amongst the river of procedurals in this day and age, it takes a little something extra to stand out to me. Having never seen the original Hawaii Five-O, I came into this series unspoiled and open to being impressed. And believe me, they had me hooked from the first explosion.    Okay, I'll admit, the majority of the cases aren't that hard to figure out. In fact, I dare say that the cases - with the exception of the character driven story arcs that are woven throughout the season - aren't the big draw for this series. Its the character's chemistry with one another - specifically Alex O'Loughlin's Steve McGarrett and Scott Caan's Danny \\"Danno\\" Williams. It's the location, because I can barely remember a series shot solely in Hawaii (maybe Magnum PI). The combination of a cast that works well together, draws the viewers in and makes us care about them AND the beautiful, exotic backdrop of Hawaii is an intoxicating mix.     The action and drama of solving the cases with this crew is tempered by moments of touching friendship and hilarious banter - again Danny and Steve are the main magnet for this show, I have no doubt - and underneath the day-to-day dealings in crime fighting, there is a mystery. It always helps to have an ubber-villian like Wo Fat tied into this mystery.    Not since the days of Starskey and Hutch, I have rarely seen to leading men play off each other so well, as our Steve and Danny. Season one builds their partnership as well as their friendship, because both are semi-outcasts in Hawaii. Steve's laser-focus, inherent bravery and penchant for leadership is balanced with a vulnerability that only Alex O'Loughlin can produce. Scott Caan brings the rough around the edges New Jersey Cop, the true outsider in Hawaii, to the table with the compassion of a father who moved half way around the globe to be with his daughter. Daniel Dae Kim's Chin Ho Kelly and Grace Park's Kono  add the cement to hold this team together on the island.     The character drivenepisodes are, in my opinion, the best by far. We learn about what drives our heroes, what scares them and what they will kill and die for. Steve's family is fully of secrets yet to be fully vetted out. Danny must reconcile with his ex, and with his need to make the island - the island that makes him feel even more like an outsider - a safer place for his kid. Chin deals with the mystery behind his disgrace from the HPD, along with his cousin Kono, who's just getting her feet wet as the rookie cop.      These are character begging to be drawn out for the viewer, and towards the end of the season, we are starting to see that. I can only hope to get more of the character development and character driven plots I'm starving for in Season 2.    Season 1 is a wild ride, getting to know these characters and how they do their job. Not to say that there aren't a couple of dud episodes, but for the most part, the writers expertly balance the action with angst, the solemness with humor, and they picked a fabulous cast to play it all out for us.

B000FC2PKG|5.0|This book was very well written and sucked me in from the start.  The main character, Bobby Dodge, struggled with the right thing to do from the beginning to the end.

B004IQMXD4|4.0|I have been a fan of Stevie Nicks since early 1983. While recovering from surgery my brother brought home \\"Mirage\\" and \\"Bella Donna,\\" and played them over and over.  And over.  I fell in love with Stevie's prose and rock-chick ethereal persona and have bought everything she has done ever since.  It is with this love and devotion that I have been hoping Nicks would eventually come through with a third act breakthrough in her career, a la Cher's Believe, Madonna's Ray Of Light, or Tina Turner's Wildest Dreams.<br /><br />\\"In Your Dreams\\" is not going to be that album.  However, it is a solid return to form in her first album of new material in exactly ten years.  The first song, \\"Secret Love\\" immediately draws you back into Stevie's mystical world of flowing scarves and gated castles and white winged doves.  She draws the listener in and prepares you for the next 64 minutes by telling you a story of private and futile love affair (\\"I'm not asking for salvation from you, I'm just asking to be saved for awhile\\").<br /><br /> This brings you right into the next gentle song, \\"For What It's Worth,\\" (produced by Tom Petty & The Heartbreaker's Mike Campbell) during which Nicks reflects on the glorious ball of her life with the voice of a deeper and wiser woman than we are used to hearing from her (\\"I got to sing, I got to dance, I got to be part of a great romance.\\")<br /><br />Strangely enough, the title track for me is one of the duller and more predictable pieces on the album.  Fortunately, it leads right into the very clever and musically sophisticated \\"Wide Sargasso Sea,\\" another Nicks penned tale of gothic romance and tragic lost with a certain \\"Englishman.\\"<br /><br />Midway through the energy and excitement of the first part subside, and the album goes through a series of more simple straightforward tracks.  It is no coincidence that these songs were written and arranged by Nicks herself, which by no means is intended as a slam.  It is simply to say that Nicks has always thrived when working with a producer who can use her words and melodies to create new landscapes of sound, vision, and crystal dreams (ie, Lindsey Buckingham, Tom Petty, Rick Nowels,  Jimmy Iovine, and so on).<br /><br />Fortunately, Dave Stewart is exactly the right producer to make the magic happen on the last part of this album.  My favorites songs are all in the final third which include the beautifully haunting \\"Everybody Loves You,\\" Ghosts Are Gone,\\" and the stunning vocal range displayed in \\"Italian Summer.\\" These pieces are all results of collaborating with Stewart, and trusting his unique and distinct musical direction.  They represent musical and vocal growth for Nicks, and are the exact pitch perfect reward for the fans who have waited ten years for new material.<br /><br />All in all this is a strong return.  It will satiate her fans from decades past, but I am not certain it is going to gain her any new ones.  My hope is that Nicks continues to build on her confidence and momentum to produce material more frequently, and try more experimentation.  Rumor had it that the Pet Shop Boys want to collaborate.

B00000G3AZ|4.0|This is definitely the chocolate-box version of Emma. It focuses on all the comedic, light-hearted elements of the story over everything else. Quite a bit had to be cut for time, and the Frank Churchill/Jane Fairfax story suffered the most, I think. Still, most of the cast was good (with some exceptions!) and it's a fun romantic comedy...even if it's not the best adaptation.<br /><br />I especially love Gwyneth Paltrow's Emma. Jeremy Northam is perhaps a bit too suave but still good as Mr. Knightley. The Eltons and Miss Bates were also great. Unfortunately Toni Collette was awful as Harriet Smith, as were Ewan McGregor as Frank Churchill (hideous wig) and Polly Walker as Jane Fairfax (too robust).<br /><br />This was a fun movie, but not quite Jane Austen's Emma. The Mr. Elton story was given a lot more focus over the Frank Churchill one. I think if I could change just one thing, I'd play up the Frank/Jane story more. Oh, and get rid of the ugly wig as well.
1573301183|5.0|This is as good today as it was when it first appeared on MTV. Pure Alice at their best in a unique intimate environment. Although it is a little sad to see Layne so weak from his addiction, if you look closely you can see how Jerry watches over him, encourages him and tells him it's OK when he misses a lyric. Must have for any AIC fan.
0141439513|5.0|like Pride and Prejudice. I really do. It's one of my favorite novels. But, I must confess, it's not my favorite Jane Austen novel. I like both Persuasion and Emma better and Sense and Sensibility is very, very close.<br /><br />I first read the book when I was 14 and I absolutely loved Elizabeth Bennet and her sharp wit. I really liked Darcy too, but everyone paled in comparison to Elizabeth. I thought the story was incredibly romantic. I even thought Mr. Bennet was a doll. I saw the 1995 version very shortly after I finished the book and my opinions were less than favorable. But that's a review for another day.<br /><br />My opinion has changed over the years and frequent rereads. I saw what a bad father and husband Mr. Bennet really was. I still like Elizabeth and Darcy, but mostly because they are dynamic characters who mature and grow to become a worthy couple. I find Elizabeth quite immature and a bit too sure of herself in the beginning and Darcy to be on the controlling side. They are both proud and both prejudiced in the beginning but I do like that they learn from their mistakes and change.<br /><br />The book is a delightful comedy of manners. But I more highly admire Elinor Dashwood, Anne Elliot, and even Fanny Price than Elizabeth Bennet. And I'd take Frederick Wentworth, Henry Tilney, Mr. Knightley, or Colonel Brandon over Darcy. Although the 10,000 a year does work in his favor...

B00003JRCQ|5.0|The 1995 Persuasion movie is not only my favorite adaptation of that particular book, it's one of my top five Jane Austen adaptations. And one of my favorite period movies. And just one of my favorite movies! It's just that good. The cast is excellent. I love the look and feel of realism it has too, similar to the 2005 Pride and Prejudice and Bright Star movies- realistic lighting, no makeup, messy  hair, etc.<br /><br />Every adaptation has its flaws, and I guess I should just get them out of the way beforehand. This film contains one big historical error! The sailors often go about in their naval uniforms. While this looks really nice on screen, it is actually not accurate. As we know from Mansfield Park, these uniforms could only be seen while the officers were on duty. Probably most casual viewers wouldn't know this and it's cool to see them though. Another issue that doesn't really bother me in particular is the somewhat lacking exposition. I feel a little bit, that this movie was written with book fans in mind. If you weren't already familiar with the story, you might find it a bit confusing, especially in the beginning, what was going on between Anne and Wentworth. As I said, I had no problem following anything but since I had already read the book that doesn't really mean much.<br /><br />The casting is admittedly not perfect. Many of the actors are a bit too old, but nothing jarring like in 1971. Their brilliant performances more than made up for this- with one big exception- Phoebe Nicholls as Elizabeth Elliot was way over the top.<br /><br />Both the canceled and actual ending of the book were used. Some liked the addition, but I could take it or leave it, personally. Some of the other changes from the book may have worked as just a movie, but were lacking for me as an adaptation. Actually, I can say that about pretty much everything- there's nearly nothing in this movie that I don't like as just a movie.<br /><br />Before I say again how much I love this movie (I ended up rewatching it 3 times!), I remembered another scene that bothered me. Anne is taken to Upper Cross in a farmer's cart instead of Lady Russell's carriage. Really? That was stretching it quite a bit. I know Sir Walter doesn't pay much attention to her, but he would never allow his daughter to be seen traveling in that way! And Lady Russell would never have allowed it! She couldn't spare her carriage to go 3 miles away??<br /><br />All in all, admittedly, this movie is not perfect. But it's still a darn good movie and it's the closest to perfection any of the adaptations of Persuasion have gotten so far.t 3 times!), I remembered another scene that bothered me.

This was my first Heyer that followed a married couple and needless to say it didn't leave a very good impression.

B004N66XYE|3.0|This series seemed to have everything going for it. I highly enjoyed Downton Abbey, which I'd heard had the same feel- showcasing the family as well as the servants of the house, I absolutely adore Claire Foy, and it looked great in all the teasers I saw. Unfortunately, I thought it was a disappointment.<br /><br />I don't know if it's because it had the misfortune to be aired so soon after Downton Abbey or what, but I couldn't help comparing the two. I just felt this one paled in comparison. Honestly, it was pretty good...but not great. I don't know if I would think more highly of it if I saw it first or not. I'm inclined to think not, but I'm really not sure.<br /><br />I'll say one thing I loved about the show- the look. It was gorgeous- the sets, the costumes, the production values were all top-notch. Claire Foy has always been beautiful (and looks great in period clothing) but I have a soft spot for '30s fashions (my favorite part of the 2005 King Kong was the costumes and scenery as well!) and she really shined more than ever in them. I found myself so envious at times and wishing I could look just like her...silly I know. Her character wasn't very nice, but she sure was pretty.<br /><br />The main point against this show was the lack of likable characters. Jean Marsh was pretty forgettable, which I found surprising, given her history with the show and her performance as Mrs. Ferrars in Sense and Sensibility. I've never been a big fan of Keeley Hawes and she gave the usual blah performance here. It's not that everybody was bad or anything, but most of the decent characters were simply not very memorable.<br /><br />The other big problem was the storytelling itself. There were a good bit of nice moments throughout, but the whole was less than the sum of its parts here. Everything seemed to move too fast- the character development and everything just didn't seem believable to me. One minute a man and woman are fighting, the next they're in bed, the next they've broken up. A new character is introduced, given a backstory, and killed off in the same episode. Everybody's got all these issues but then at the end everything gets all wrapped up with no explanation. It was just like they tried to cram too many storylines in too little time.<br /><br />Maybe with a new screenwriter, the next season could be an improvement? I dunno. It wasn't terrible.

B0013FSL3E|1.0|This movie was given to me as a thank you gift from one of my larger corporate clients.  I heard that it had won, or was at least nominated for, an Academy Award.  The trailer looked cute.  I gave it a watch and was deeply saddened by the film.  Not so much the storyline, rather that this was supposed to be a children's film.    The subplots of corporate greed and human laziness were slaps in the face.  Admittedly, we do have a massive obesity problem in this country.  Not many people care about the environment any more.  And corporate greed can be found in the headlines of major newspapers on a regular basis.  These are not themes that I think children should be confronted with in their DVDs.    I was glad to see that the packaging of the DVD was environmentally friendly, however the Disney/Pixar films that I have purchased, or were given to me, since Wall-E was released on DVD have not been.  If these companies are so concerned about the environment why are they not doing more simple things like environmnentally friendly packaging.    I felt the movie was heavy handed and not appropriate for children.  Spend time with your children planting a garden, teaching them to recycle, and playing games outdoors rather than sit them in front of screen to watch some movie with themes that they cannot fully understand.
B001C4AFOY|4.0|When most people think of Queen Victoria, they probably think a fat little prudish woman. That was certainly her image as she got on in years but by focusing this on when she is a young woman (and played by the beautiful, slim Emily Blunt) she definitely has more appeal to audiences. The movie is gorgeous, beautifully acted (loved Mark Strong as Sir John Conroy. He's much better playing villains like this and Lord Blackwood in Sherlock Holmes), and really romantic. As a historical work alone it's probably not the best but as a historical romance it's great! The costumes are all really eye-catching. I was surprised at how much I liked them! It's my least favorite era in fashion history and most of Victoria's gowns are borderline gaudy (she is the queen after all!), yet the costume designer and Emily Blunt managed to make them work.
B0007KS7D0|4.0|This is an extremely clear, sharp macro attachment which is excellent value for the money. Unfortunately, I bought both the more powerful and more expensive Raynox dcr-250 close-up conversion lens AND this dcr-150, which was a total waste of money. You see, the other idiotic reviewer Sanka who'd also bought both lenses neglected to say that if you're using the dcr-250 on a ZOOM lens, you need only zoom out a bit to get the SAME results you'd achieve using the dcr-150 zoomed all the way in! So let me repeat to save you $: if you're already using the dcr-250 on a zoom lens, DON'T buy this dcr-150 - you're already covered by the range of the dcr-250.
B000Z27HLS|3.0|After 20 years with the horrible 1987 version as the only adaptation of Northanger Abbey, many fans were eagerly anticipating the new 2007 version. I was a little nervous about Andrew Davies writing the script, given his tendency to sex things up, but the cast looked really good. And then I saw it...<br /><br />Suffice it to say- I was totally right! Most of the cast was really good, especially JJ Feild as Henry Tilney...but it was really sexed up. Most of this was in the form of Catherine's dreams, but there was something else too. One scene in particular was just plain wrong! Why, Andrew Davies, why? He seemed to interpret the story to be Catherine's sexual awakening. Sorry, I didn't see any of that in the book- it was a comedy! This version has funny moments too, but it's really all the sexed up scenes that bothered me. Davies seemed to have missed the point, but at least not as badly as the 1987 creators did.<br /><br />I wouldn't call this adaptation terrible, or anything. It just wasn't as great as it could have been. It was filmed in Dublin, because I guess they were too cheap to actually go to Bath (yet somehow the 1987 version could afford it? And even Persuasion that was filmed at the same time?) I did like that we got a nice little introduction that was close to what was in the book. There was even an epilogue- but it was so short, blink and you'll miss it!<br /><br />I think what annoys me so much about this movie is not how \\"bad\\" it was, but how bad it was compared to how good it could have been! With such a great cast, it could have been really excellent. Instead it was a disappointment.

B002XTBE6K|5.0|I wasn't all that impressed the first time I watched it. I thought the little prologue was cheesy (and they fudged with the timeline), Emma was too over-the-top, Jane Fairfax was too mousey, and that it just wasn't all that special. But when I got to the third episode, everything changed-I started to love it! And when I got the DVD and rewatched it all, I appreciated the first two episodes more as well.<br /><br />Being four hours long, this version has enough time to flesh out all the characters and storylines. Both the 1996 versions, being so short, had to obviously cut some stuff out. Either the Frank/Jane or the Harriet/Mr. Elton stuff got the shaft. This one does justice to both, plus more! We get to see a lot more of Robert Martin as well, and we even get to see him go ask Mr. Knightley's advice as to whether to propose to Harriet. It follows pretty closely to the book, but it does make some changes and a lot of the dialogue is different.<br /><br />The parallels between Frank Churchill, Jane Fairfax, and Emma are stressed more than in any adaptation or the book. Mr. Knightley narrates the introduction with the three as children- when they all lose parent(s) and their lives are changed forever. I found this narration a bit weird the first time I saw it but now I think it was a clever introduction, really. The only reason it bothered me was because it was different from the book, really!<br /><br />Most of the cast is very good- some of my favorites of all the adaptations. The interplay between the various characters was excellent (in most cases). The Crown Ball scene was particularly well-done. The dances (all originals to this production) were really lively and fun. Emma and Knightley's dance just oozed chemistry. I think I played back this scene three times on my latest rewatch. I could almost go so far as to say the miniseries is worth watching for this scene alone! I also think they got the Box Hill scene right (with the exception of Frank lounging on Emma's lap!). Emma was clearly laughing and joking around and didn't realize how hurtful her comment to Miss Bates was until it was too late.<br /><br />This was a very well-done series, but not without its flaws. One part I still am not fond of is the end. I thought the editing of the scenes after Emma and Knightley confess their love was a bit choppy. I thought the individual scenes were well-done, but there were really no transitions between them and I had no sense of how much time had passed or anything. Like I said, just too choppy.<br /><br />Still, all the negatives are pretty minor.

0141439807|4.0|Mansfield Park is not one of the more popular Austen novels, and I must confess, it's not my favorite either. In fact, it's probably my second to last favorite before Northanger Abbey. It's much more serious than her other books. There's not as much light humor. It's really not very romantic. Many people find the heroine, Fanny Price, insipid. So much so that the two latest adaptations of it totally changed her personality.<br /><br />Even though MP is low on my list of Austen novels, I think it's far from being a bad or boring book. True, it's focus seems to be more on morality rather than romance or comedy but I still enjoy it. While Edmund Bertram is admittedly low on my list of Austen heroes, I do like and admire Fanny Price, both as a character and as a person. Many readers may find her dull but I just don't think so. Yes, she is weak and has low confidence in the beginning. But who can blame her? She wasn't brought up in good conditions and then was taken away from her family at a young age. And Mrs. Norris has pretty much made her life hell. She has a strong set of morals in spite of this. She is able to see through the outwardly charming but inwardly ugly Crawfords (who even fool Edmund!) and will not back down in her refusal to marry Henry. This means so much more coming from her than it would from an outspoken girl, like Elizabeth Bennet. It took a lot more courage for the timid Fanny to stand up for herself and say no to Henry than for Lizzy, who always speaks her mind, to refuse Mr. Collins or Darcy, that's for sure!<br /><br />The Crawfords are pretty popular among some readers from what I've seen, so they've charmed more than the book characters, apparently! I've seen comparisons of Mary to Elizabeth Bennet, which surprises and irritates me. Yes, they are both witty, but that's as far as I'd take it. Elizabeth, while immature in the beginning of the book, is still a compassionate and pretty much unselfish person. Mary Crawford is very selfish (she doesn't even try to hide it) and is only after rank and fortune. She falls for Edmund in spite of herself but still tries to constantly persuade him not to be a clergyman because that is apparently not good enough of a profession for her. She really shows her ugly side in a letter to Fanny near the end in which she expresses her hopes that Tom will die so that Edmund will become heir to Mansfield Park and the baronetcy! Edmund finally opens his eyes to Mary's true nature after Henry and Maria's elopement. She doesn't seem to have any awareness that their adultery is wrong, only that they were not discreet about it and got caught! Really, can you picture Elizabeth Bennet saying these things? I've never understood Henry's popularity either. Yes, he's charming. Yes, he did fall in love with Fanny. But do people really think she could have been happy with him or reformed him? He would have probably been back to his rakish ways in a short time if she did marry him. Fanny saw him toying with both Maria and Julia's affections (despite Maria being engaged) and knew this. He ran off with Maria when things were looking up for his case! And he only started the whole affair with Fanny because he wanted to put a \\"hole in her heart.\\" Yeah, what a catch...<br /><br />I think the only thing I really find lacking in this book is the romance between Edmund and Fanny. I know that Austen didn't intend that as her focus and I am happy that Fanny got what she always wanted, but it still would have been nice to see some romantic scenes between them at the end.

B0007OY2P8|1.0|The year 1987 brought some good things into the world- like me, for instance! It also brought some really crappy things- like a bizarre TV adaptation of Northanger Abbey! I just found it that originally aired only two days after I was born. This was the first adaptation of the book (it's just not as popular as her others, probably for the same reasons I listed in my review) and it was the only one for another twenty years. It was scripted by Maggie Wadey, who also wrote the 2007 version of Mansfield Park....yeah, there's your first hint that it isn't going to be great.<br /><br />I like to call this version \\"Northanger Abbey on acid. \\" That's the only explanation I can think of for this tragedy. The creators were high. Catherine, at least, was clearly on hallucinogens to be having all her weird dream sequences. Because this version is just weird! The only good thing I can think of was that it was actually filmed on location in Bath. And...that's about it. Okay, a couple of the actors were decent (and only a couple!) but that wasn't enough to save it! The script is horrible, Catherine's fantasies are horrible, a lot of the acting is horrible, and the music is horrible- weird 80s stuff trying to lend a \\"spooky\\" atmosphere. This version also invents a really...odd character, the Marchioness, which I'll go into more detail about below. Did they not realize that this was supposed to be satire? Because it seemed to take itself seriously- unless we're all wrong and it actually was supposed to be a parody of the book... then the joke's on us!<br /><br />I really don't know what they were thinking with this version. They completely missed the point. Was it supposed to be an over the top parody? Because I wasn't laughing.

It also displays the name of the song playing if the radio station supplies it.  And, I can record the radio if there is something I want to listen to later (useful for talk radio, I'm not big on \\"downloading music\\" this way because of the low bit-rate).

1402238843|5.0|I'll have to be honest and say it took me a long time to get into this book. I had read about the first two chapters before I got stuck. Admittedly, this was partly because of personal reasons and I also lost the book at one point. Yet it was true that I was not hooked from the start. But a few weeks ago, after finding it again I gave it another go. I was not disappointed! I'm usually not a fan of the \\"reformed rake\\" cliche yet this book didn't quite follow that pattern. I found Venetia and Damarel's love story to be very natural (and a bit sensual at parts!) and after all, Venetia did not even try to reform Damarel. She fell in love with him, knew he loved her as well, and thought she would have a much more exciting life as his wife. I like to think that Damarel was faithful to her all the same, as his past reckless behavior really all stemmed from a broken heart.

0141439580|5.0|Now that I have all my computer business sorted out (and at home sick today) I'm going to try to get moving on my Jane Austen reviews. Emma was the second Jane Austen book I read, and the only one I read for school. I was 15 at the time and actually wasn't all that fond of the book. It was funny, yes, but I found Emma herself absolutely insufferable and the relationship between her and Mr. Knightley kind of squicky (fell in love with her at 13???)  but watched the Gwyneth Paltrow movie and liked it. A couple years later, I gave it another try and loved it!<br /><br />It's probably second or third favorite of all Jane Austen's novels. I still find Emma to be very irritating at times but she is a very amusing character to read about. Like Elizabeth Bennet in a way, she is so sure of herself and her impressions of people and turns out to be totally wrong at just about everything. I like how she learns her lesson when some of her matchmaking attempts go awry. And I realized that Mr. Knightley wasn't serious about falling for Emma when she was only 13, thank heavens. I like that Frank Churchill, the \\"bad guy\\" of the book, isn't exactly a villain per se, but still a total cad.<br /><br />Most of all, I like the element of mystery. Who sent Jane Fairfax the piano? What secrets are the characters hiding? It wasn't a crime novel or anything, \\"only\\" a romance,  but throughout there was a sense that things weren't what they seemed, which I enjoyed. Of course, now there's no surprise to learn of Jane and Frank's engagement but it's fun to pick out the all the hints or \\"clues\\" that Mr. Knightley picks up on but Emma is totally oblivious to.<br /><br />I like Mr. Knightley as a character, but he's not exactly my type. Emma needs someone to keep her on the right track, but I'd be afraid he'd be nagging me all the time. I guess it's of no importance, since he's a fictional character and all, but it's still fun to think about.
B004IFYMWK|4.0|Based on the Plame affair and adapted from her memoirs.  Tale focuses on a non James Bond CIA operative who is betrayed by people within the White House.  Sean Penn's acting was better than usual.  Themes of integrity were done well enough but not to the point of becoming sappy.  People interested in politics or who want to have another reason to hate on George W. Bush (like we need more reasons) will want to check this one out.  The actor who portrayed Scooter Libby (that would be David Andrews) did a really good job as a jerkus maximus.  The authenticity of this tale is still being debated but most seem to believe Plame.  CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B to B plus; STORY/PLOTTING: B; THEMES: B plus; WHEN WATCHED: yesterday; MY GRADE: B to B plus.
0141439688|5.0|What is my favorite Jane Austen book? Not that I don't love them all but that honor would have to go to Persuasion. It's more mature in tone than her other works, featuring an older heroine. Anne Elliot is 27 and has lost her bloom after being persuaded to break off her engagement to Frederick Wentworth 8 years previously. I love Anne Elliot and it's a tough call to choose between her and Elinor Dashwood for a favorite heroine.<br /><br />Unlike some of Austen's other books, my opinion on this one hasn't really changed at all over the years. I've loved it from the first time I read it and my love has only grown with each rereading. I had the impression before reading it that it would be more on the depressing side, like Mansfield Park, but it's really not. It has the usual cast of satirical, amusing side characters, like the vane Sir Walter and snobby Elizabeth, the hypochondriac Mary, etc. I feel like it's the most romantic of Austen's works as well. You can feel the tension of the unspoken feelings between Anne and Wentworth throughout the whole book until it all comes out in Wentworth's beautiful letter. It makes me swoon every time!<br /><br />The only complaint I really have for this book is that it's so short and a bit truncated. I believe Austen's failing health made her rush things a little bit and cut out some originally planned material. IIRC, she had intended to include some more about Mr. Elliot and Mrs. Clay, but I'm okay with how it ended up.
0670022411|4.0|For fans of paranormal fiction, there are often two things that the stories have in common; a love story wrought with turbulence and sex scenes that make a 45 year old woman blush.  Deborah Harkness has handled these two things very well.  Without giving too much of premise away; it is nice to see that characters can work together instead of constantly working against each other.  It takes more courage to love than it does to argue, deny and run away.  It is also nice to read a story that has actual romance and building passion and more than crude sex. (Anita Blake, take a hint).  There are some reviews that focus on the extraordinarily accomplished main character.  What I have to say about this is, remember people, it is a fantasy novel - fiction.  It is escapism at its best with rich and flawed characters, historical references and an ever expanding story.  Enjoy!
1453767533|4.0|Ah, Northanger Abbey, without a doubt my least favorite Jane Austen novel. For the longest time I thought Sense and Sensibility was the worst, until I reread them all last year and wondered just what the hell I was thinking all those years.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I think NA is really funny and I absolutely adore Henry Tilney (one of my top 3 Austen heroes!) but compared to her others, this novel is weak. It was her first novel sold to a publisher, in 1803, under the title Susan. For some reason, the publisher sat on it for years until her brother bought it back. I don't think it was revised at all before she died- it was published posthumously with Persuasion. It's very different in tone from all her other novels. It still shows glimpses of her wit and the dramatic ironies and everything, but it's closer to a spoof of the popular Gothic novels of the day than anything else. The romance is pretty lacking (again, spoofing the Gothic novels)- Henry only falls for Catherine because he realized she loved him!<br /><br />I don't want anyone to think I don't like this book- I do! It has comedy in spades. It just lacks the depth of all her other works.
B004XWLN20|3.0|I have been with the series since the Pilot First aired on the WB, Now the CW, Wow 9+ years when by fast.

I can remember the Lois and Clark series but this one did so much better!!!!
B000244FDW|4.0|This is not my favorite P&P (I have perhaps an irrational love for 2005) but it has a lot going for it. It does change a few things from the book (all adaptations do) but I feel it remained true to the spirit throughout. It's much more under-stated and \\"low-key\\" than the other adaptations- no real sexed up scenes or over the top caricatures. It's biggest strength, IMO, is its cast, who are almost all close to the book characters' ages and descriptions. The biggest negative is the low production values of the time, which is just something one has to get used to.<br /><br />This version, even though it changes some things around and adds and cuts a few scenes, keeps others that no other adaptation has (unless it's one of those older ones that are not available to the public!). I especially like the scene after the second proposal where Darcy and Elizabeth discuss their attraction to each other and when it began. That's one of my favorite scenes in the book and it always disappoints me that the others don't include it!<br /><br />As with all the older adaptations, if dated, stagey production values turn you off, you probably won't like this version. But if you can look past that, I think you will really like it like I do!
B000JMLFLW|4.0|i really love this book! i liked the movie with keira. (i never was into the whole pirates of the caribbean) i saw the movie first and then got the book from a bookstore, and when i got my kindle i downloaded the book so i could re-read it when i had craving for a pride and prejudice fix. i can read this book over and over.<br />the only problem that i see is the formatting and that is why it is a 4 star, i really think it is the kindle itself because i have the pc kindle and everything is just the way it is in the book.
B001UV4XI8|5.0|The acting was outstanding. I've always felt Rupert Grint as Ron was the most natural of the trio but up until now he hasn't had much to work with, usually stuck as comic relief. Finally he got to show off more of his skill in some real dramatic moments. Emma Watson's Hermione was the weakest to me in the first five films, overacting and constantly wiggling her eyebrows. Thankfully she improved in HBP and got even better this time! I thought the two of them outshone Daniel Radcliffe as Harry, who was good, don't get me wrong. He just slightly paled in comparison to the other two. The supporting cast was equally good. Peter Mullan was very intimidating as Yaxley and even better than I imagined him in the book. Nick Moran's Scabior played a bigger role than in the book and was almost alluring in a really creepy way. Helena Bonham Carter's Bellatrix was a touch toned down from the previous films, which I was grateful for. I was also so glad we finally got to meet Bill Weasley and Mundungus Fletcher.<br /><br />The soundtrack was really good. I particularly loved Obliviated in the beginning because it caught my attention right away and Farewell to Dobby because it was so beautiful and moving. The cinematography was also excellent. I wasn't fond of the camping scenes in the book but I didn't mind them in the movie because of the gorgeous location shots! Nearly all of the individual scenes were well-done, with a perfect balance of drama, action, and comedy. My favorites were Hermione erasing her parents' memories and the silver doe. I was confused about the Harry/Hermione dance scene because I felt it was a bit out of character for Harry, but it was actually pretty cute.<br /><br />The film wasn't perfect. My two biggest complaints were the lack of explanation for the mirror shard and no use of the invisibility cloak. Since the cloak is one of the Hallows, wouldn't it have made sense to remind the non-hardcore audience about it? Similarly, those who haven't read the books will be scratching their heads trying to figure out where Harry got the mirror shard.I also felt Ginny was really a nonentity. Hers and Harry's romance was poorly treated in HBP as well and I was disappointed that it was more of the same this time.<br /><br />My other complaints are really minor quibbles in comparison. I missed seeing Dudley and Harry's handshake, even though the movie works perfectly fine without it. I would have liked to see Harry and Ron hug after the destruction of the locket and have Harry assure Ron that he only sees Hermione as a sister (especially since some viewers thought he was trying to come on to Hermione in the dance scene!). I also felt Malfoy Manor, while a nice scene in itself, paled in comparison to the book. It was slightly rushed and watered down- namely Ron's reaction and Wormtail's fate. I suppose this was done for a reason, and it does work in the movie- but the book scene was so much better.<br /><br />The end only made me want Part II right now! I guess I'll have to reread the book to satisfy myself until July.ing their heads trying to figure out where Harry got the mirror shard.I also felt Ginny was really a nonentity.

0767020308|3.0|This version of Emma weirdly came out in the same year as the Gwyneth Paltrow film. But other than being based on the same book, the two adaptations really have nothing in common. While the film version was all comedy and lightness, this TV version is really quite dark. I mean that both literally and figuratively. Maybe it's because of the poor video quality, but the picture is usually quite dark. This makes sense, I suppose, to have realistic candle light at night-time scenes. But the scenes in the day-time aren't that bright either.<br /><br />Andrew Davies, the screenwriter, chose to do something very different with this Emma. He focuses a lot on the class system, which was always there in the context of the book, but I thought it was a bit heavy-handed in this adaptation. All the underclass workers-servants, farmers, etc.- are clearly present in every scene, making the way of life for the privileged possible. They're even moving pillows for them to kneel on in the strawberry picking scene. Emma makes sure to tell Harriet that Mr. Knightley owns EVERYTHING in Donwell, and all the other people who live there are merely his tenants or servants. Robert Martin seems very resentful of Emma, like he knows she advised Harriet to refuse him. He glares at her when she drops Harriet off at the farm. It's a big deal at the end when Emma shakes hands with him. This class system was in the background in the book and I'm not fond of Davies' idea to play it up (but I did think Emma and Robert Martin shaking hands was a nice touch). It's just not what I want to see when I watch a Jane Austen adaptation.<br /><br />This is far from my favorite Emma adaptation. Aside from all the darkness, I wasn't fond of most of the cast. It was also very short and while I know things need to be condensed, it felt very rushed and the Crown Ball scene was poorly done, IMO. Harriet is dancing in the beginning, then Elton snubs her, then Mr. Knightley dances with her for less than a minute before walking away! Blink and you'll miss it. The ending scene was also rather weak- a harvest ball with Mr. Knightley making a speech to all his tenants (stressing again how many people depend on him) that he will still keep everything running smoothly even after he moves to Hartfield. Well, at least I can say that at least Andrew Davies didn't add any sexed up scenes.<br /><br />I was not a fan of Kate Beckinsale and Mark Strong as the leading characters. Beckinsale's Emma was too cold and Strong's Knightley was way too harsh. The one saving grace of the cast was the beautiful Olivia Williams as Jane Fairfax. She was sublime and elegant despite being dressed plainly.<br /><br />I do like this one better than the 1972 miniseries, but really, that's not saying much. It does have its fans though, and I can understand their point of view, even if I don't share it. If you hate the Gwyneth Paltrow version, in particular, you'll probably love this one.nk and you'll miss it.

B000YIGNKE|1.0|Persuasion is my favorite Jane Austen novel and just one of my favorite books of all-time. The 1995 version is one of my favorite movies. When I heard about the new ITV version coming out in 2007, I had really high hopes and couldn't wait to see another spin on the story. And then it came out and I watched it and...let's just say, I was not impressed.<br /><br />I wanted to like it. I really did. I just watched this for the third time for the review. I was hoping that I would find more to like with each rewatch but unfortunately they had the opposite effect. I just found more things that I hated! What do I hate? Just the script, the cast, and the direction. So yeah, um...pretty much everything. Was there anything I liked about it? Well, the music was nice and the cinematography was pretty (aside from the overuse of shaky cam). And a couple of the side characters were well-acted. Hmm...that's about it!<br /><br />The adaptation suffers first of all from being too short. It just feels so truncated and rushed and so many of my favorite bits from the book were left out or just ruined. It didn't seem like the creators cared about the story at all. With only a couple exceptions, I hated the cast. I don't know if the actors or the writing or directing are to blame, but the performances left a lot to be desired. Everything just felt off. I tried not to compare it too much to the 1995 version and even though I couldn't help but do that at some points, I just hate this version on its own. Whatever you do, don't accuse me of disliking it only because of the 1995 version. While it certainly pales in comparison to that version, my hate stems from this just being a poor adaptation of the book, and a poor movie in itself.<br /><br />It had such potential but it was all wasted. In some parts it seemed like they were copying 1995, and in others it was as if they were trying too hard to be different. I just don't understand. I would actually rank this in my bottom five Austen adaptations, sadly. Even the 1971 version, dull as it was, was better than this.71 version, dull as it was, was better than this.
B004Q1FDHO|5.0|very fun and addictive. enjoying playing it and is a bit challenging at some points. worth it. even though it was free : )
0141439661|5.0|Sense and Sensibility was Austen's first published novel and the third of hers I read. I must admit, I did not like it very much at first. I found it too somber compared to some of her other works. I liked Elinor well enough, but Marianne annoyed me to no end. The men weren't that great either. Willoughby was doubtless a scoundrel, Colonel Brandon was boring, and Edward was a spineless wimp. That's not to say I did not like the book, far from it. Just in comparison to other Austen novels it didn't hold up.<br /><br />All that changed on my last rereading this year. It was such a surprise to see all the humor in the book! How did I not notice before? Yes, it does deal with some dark subjects but there are more than enough funny moments to go around. Mrs. Jennings stands out in particular, especially the scene where she overhears bits of Colonel Brandon and Elinor's conversation. Brandon is of course, telling Elinor he intends to give Edward the living at Delaford. But Mrs. Jennings, not wishing to \\"eavesdrop\\", can't hear everything and jumps to other conclusions. Another funny scene is a man taking forever to pick out a particular toothpick case in a shop, who turns out to be none other than Robert Ferrars. And I must not forget to mention Elinor! Anyone who imagines her as all prim and proper from the movies should take a closer look at the book- she is full of snark! It made me love her even more.<br /><br />My opinions on the men changed as well. Not Willoughby, of course. But on closer reading one notices that Colonel Brandon, while he may seem \\"stuffy\\" is actually quite the romantic. And Edward really is an honorable man. Yes, you all want him to just dump Lucy for Elinor but he felt he was actually doing the right thing by Lucy in keeping his promise to her. And there was the fact that she could have sued him for breaking the engagement...And he's not really so dull either. I noticed he even teased Marianne about Willoughby at one point. He did have some personality after all!<br /><br />So, all in all, the male characters are not my favorite of Austen's heroes, but I do appreciate them a great deal more. Marianne does still annoy me at the beginning but I feel for her more now, and admire how she realizes the error of her ways in letting her sensibilities take over all the time. The relationship between Elinor and Marianne is really well-written, more the focus than either of the romances. Austen's writing skills were not quite to the level of sophistication that she would achieve with her later works like Persuasion, but still pretty darn good! So, if you already love the book, good for you. If you don't, I recommend rereading and keeping in mind the things I noted in this review. I hope you'll learn to love it as I have.ality after all!<br /><br />So, all in all, the male characters are not my favorite of Austen's heroes, but I do appreciate them a great deal more.

B004Q1FDHO|5.0|I did not expect this much fun from this game. Surprisingly in-depth story and game mechanics. Highly recommend this game.
B002TRL87Q|5.0|I don't have all of their albums but I have been a fan since the first release. I look at this band like its my generation's unsung Led Zeppelin. But bigger in a way...   Every song on this album is positioned so perfectly to create a dynamic both sonic and emotional. They all hit me so deeply.     Some reviewers chastise this recording as \\"not heavy enough\\" - or \\"not fast enough\\". As if this band is merely a flat rock act expected to play endless wailing guitar leads in between gritty southern lyrics about drinking and life on the road per the proven equation.    This album in particular, has so much range. It's a statement of what the band sees and is able to capture musically. The guitar trade-offs between Haynes and Billy Gibbons is cool on so many levels - the sound, the attitude, the friendship, ...  The way the band joins in and Warren's guitar speaks through the spinning leslie cabinet as \\"Forevermore\\" reaches new depth in the middle of the second verse reminds me so strongly of everything that I've ever loved and wound up losing. Jorge's churning bass intro to \\"Monday Mourning\\" is a swirling tapestry of echos stabbed through by Haynes, Abts and Louis with an opening progression that evokes a lot of the feelings I remember witnessing both during 911 and during the 2009 inauguration.  Fear, stress, rage, resentment, cynisism, self-righteousness, false pride - I don't know the exact meaning of this song, and I am not sure how a songwriter/musician approaches writing music and lyrics expecting to effectively convey emotional content like this, but it happened on this record in my opinion.    The reason I love Govt Mule is because, no matter where they seem to land their collective inspiration, it falls in a place that is timely and aligned with some unnamable vibe that I feel in this world too.    Maybe its just what happens in my life but, more likely it is the way that Govt Mule change and evolve - doing what they want to do and reflecting real life in theirmusic.  Their music is very personal to me. I don't tell everyone I know about them. Like a secret. This is one my favorite albums.

You will enjoy the 20 minutes you spend reading those reviews -- FOR FREE!  Then you can read the book anyway, but then come back and read those 1-star reviews again, because those will really make it all worthwhile.
B000TNF7NS|5.0|This is possibly UFO's best record, and the remaster sounds incredible!!! Simply great, this is how remasters should sound--fabulous. Also included are some good live tracks and a previously unreleased song \\"A Million Miles\\" which is quite a good song. Highly recommended, and get this edition if you're going to get it--absolutely great sound quality.
B004Q1FDHO|5.0|The premise is silly,  and it makes fun of red-neck trailor trash,  but it is actually a pretty fun game.     It is definitely worth thr normal price of a dollar and will keep you occupied for a while if you need to pass some time. It is a good pick up before a flight,  for example.  It gets a little repetitive,  but you won't even notice until you are several hours in.
B001LYD2JU|4.0|This is a pretty good album from Michael Schenker; if you're a fan of his days with UFO chances are that you will like this. For fans of keyboardist Don Airey (like myself) he plays on this album, though there are no standout moments or real keyboard leads. There are many guitar leads, however, and good ones. There is not really a weak song on this album, and the bonus tracks are very interesting: 5 hard-rocking early demos that almost sound better than the actual album! You also get two live tracks which are good performances. The major detractor to this CD is the sound quality--it seems as though the record was just produced badly--don't expect a masterful remaster like the UFO reissue series, it sounds much worse than those. However, its a good album, and as far as I know there are no other available editions of it, so you have to get this one if you want it. I still enjoy listening to it, though it's not the best remaster. I wouldn't let it stop you if you're a fan.
B002QGUFWE|5.0|honestly the best songs i have heard in a while. \\"Born This Way\\" will be 100x better than her first two albums though. and why is Ru Paul's album getting five star reviews and this is getting 3's and 4's? it better be becuase its edited and not becuase of the content.
B001EOOQF6|4.0|I'm a fan of the Dio, yes I am. When Ronnie joined Sabbath, it couldn't have happened at a better time for both artists to join up and move forward their careers. Heaven and Hell worked rather well in rejuvinating Sabbath from the hallow indifferences of their last few recordings with Ozzy. With Mob Rules, I feel this is perhaps, an equal to its predecessor. Some may say its a little too safe to a formula here, but with material like the headcrushing title track, the provocative, melodic Voodoo, the semi-epic Sign of the Southern Cross and the magnificent \\"sleeping giant\\" Falling Off the Edge of the World, Dio's moments within Sabbath are, for me, the next best thing since the band's heyday with Ozzy at the helm. Vinny Appice makes his debut on Mob and provides some powerful drumming here proving that he's just as good as Bill Ward was. And that's quite a statement!! But again, refer to the aforementioned tracks and you'll hear exactly why. There are a few tracks that are a bit different like Slipping Away, for example, which is a great jamming song here for the group. Country Girl has a mid-paced crunch to it that is passable and solid. My only complaint about this record is its closer, Over and Over which is, in its context, glaringly similar to Heaven and Hell's Lonley is the Word. As an overall recording, this is easily Sabbath's most consistent offering yet, although within a year things would utterly implode for this line-up, in the future of time it would also prove that Ronnie, Butler, Iommi and Appice had yet even some more unfinished business. 4 solid stars.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|I really liked this book, so much, so that when I was finished I was disappointed it ended. I found the history and lore of witchcraft interesting and thought that Harkness did a great job combining the two. I also like the love affair between Diana and Matthew, their relationship was well established. The secondary characters were compelling and only made the book that much more appealing. I am looking forward to the next book.  It did feel like it was a little unoriginal and I drew comparison to two other series, one about vampires, the other witches, but I still found this book has its own allure and charm. I recommend it to those who can read it and not compare it to other works.
B000002KFJ|3.0|In a lot of ways, I prefer this album over the previous Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath set. Hole in the Sky is just an amazing opener here to start things out with a bang. Ward thrashes away while Butler and Iommi settle into a powerful headbanging groove. Ozzy's vocal is piercing with contempt here and this is one of their last great thrashers along with Symptom of the Universe. Universe is preceded by a quick quiet interlude Don't Start(too late), which has Iommi fiddling about on a classical guitar. Universe provides another powerful song here that has an acoustic breakdown towards the coda of the track, very interesting.    Megalomania fades in and is a longer track that is vocally powerful again from Ozzy, and in some aspects it echoes a bit of the band's own title track song in its construction and chord patterns. Thrill of It All is next and reminds one of the \\"up\\" tunes from Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath(i.e. Looking for Today/Spiral Architect) synthesizer is included on the song's refrain and adds a bit of texture here. Supertzar is an instrumental replete with Choir, Xylophone and a string arrangement; it's a pretty involved production and is a far better instrumental than the previous Fluff from Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath, with a more forceful melody and a darkness as only Iommi can create.     Am I Going Insane(radio) is kind of a take it or leave it number. Featuring synthesizer as the lead instrument, its a rather mediocre track that was released as a single but, never did much in the charts. The Writ is another longer piece that while trying to keep the momentum into the red, kind of falters a bit here as well. The song could have been better arranged perhaps without too much emphasis of the middle section providing a distraction, I feel, to the rest of the song, but that's my opinion. Production was largely left to the band collectively with Mike Butcher giving a helping hand as there were management squabbles that, at times, hindered the group from getting on withthe recording of this good set. I almost give this album 4 stars, but I don't feel the midperiod records are as strong as the early period ones. Sabotage definitely gets 3 and a half...
B004UID2LC|4.0|i got this expecting issues but i just put in my username and it found my 'favorites' videos and downloaded pretty fast over wi-fi. not sure if i would try this on 3G/4G. a solid 4 stars
B000002KIK|2.0|All things considered, Sabbath were effectively in need of a change in lineup by the time this album was released. Ozzy had actually left for about a 6 month period prior to the pre-production for this record and the rest of Sabbath hired Dave Walker(ex-Savoy Brown, Fleetwood Mac) for a time period. There is a bootleg recording of Juinor's Eyes with Walker and obviously, an entire different set of lyrics which make an interesting observation as to how another singer interprets the material. However, Walker wasn't working out and Ozzy returned to the band just a few days prior to enterning Sounds Interchange in Toronto for the preparations of this album. Iommi, Ward and Butler had worked up some material with Walker, but Ozzy had no interest in going thru the material and the band was forced to simultaneously write and record new stuff while studio time and money ticked away.  Despite the rushed result, Never Say Die is actually not a terrible album, its just inconsistent. While the continuity is a bit unbalanced here with more than a few Sabbath-by-numbers songs emerging such as Shock Wave, Over to You and Johnny Blade, there are attempts at some \\"outside of the box\\" moments such as Air Dance. This track is unlike anything the band had done before or since in their long illustrious career. Its primarily piano driven with alot of overdubbed guitars(both acoustic and electric) adding a layer of sound to a song that is thoroughly original and slightly innovative. Breakout has a Horn section with Saxophone doubling up with Iommi's doom laden riff and unfortunately sounds like it was made up on the spot, just a very odd instrumental that precedes the closing track Swinging the Chain which features Bill Ward on lead vocals. This track falls into the category of indifference along with Over To You and Juinor's Eyes. The performances on this release are very tight, but the arrangements lack a bit of focus. Even the title track sounds a bit tired halfway through its rendering and that's the leadoff song on here!! I can't really say this album is better than the previous outing, Technical Ecstasy; its simply a sign that Sabbsth needed to make changes and move forward.  On a side note, Don Airey guests on keyboards to help round out numbers like Johnny Blade, Air dance and Over To You, in order to expand a bit on the musical quality and to provide a bit of texture to the songs' arrangements. No suprise that Airey would work with Ozzy when his solo career picked up after he was fired from Sabbath; his playing is most prominent on Mr. Crowley from Blizzard of Ozz. That notwithstanding, in closing out this review, Never Say Die was a decent effort, but it ultimately feels like an incomplete ending to the band that had dynamite albums such as Paranoid and Sabotage. The fire and power is missing here. 2 stars
1400079144|4.0|I loved the Da Vinci Code, but by the end I must admit by the end I found it to be a tiny bit cheesy and repetitive.  I then tried to read Angles and Demons, and wasn't even able to finish it. I can't even put my finger on what it was, but for some reason it just didn't click.  I thought I was done with Dan Brown books, but was intrigued by the fact that The Lost Symbol was based in my hometown of Washington DC.  Once I started I was hooked, and loved this book even more than the Da Vince Code.  Not just because of the setting, but because there were some surprises that I NEVER saw coming, and some scenes so terrifying that I shudder just thinking about them (claustrophobics beware!!!!).
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Has quite a few stations to choose from. playback is generally good. I have been using this app every day since I got it a couple weeks ago.  Great deal for free but It's worth it to pay money to get this app.
B001BPQT8A|5.0|Great movie, Actors, Direting, and especially Writing!  Brad Pitt does a really good job with his role.  Morgan Freeman always Great.  Kevin Spacey is amazing though he's not the lead or the supporting actor. I'm a big movie fan and I think this is a well made movie. David Fincher is a great diretor!    Fight Club, The Curious Case of Bejamin Button, The Social network, Panic Room, The Game...
0061726826|3.0|I really wanted to LOVE this book. I love dystopian books and this was a great read. But I did find myself losing interest at the beginning of the book. I don't want to blame it on the hype of the book, but I do think my expectations were extremely high because of it.<br /><br />I loved the plot of the story; it was an amazing love story. One the action started happening towards the middle of the book I was enthralled. I really wish Goodreads would let us do half stars because I would give it 3 1/2 stars for sure.<br /><br />The characters were great; I immediately fell in love with Gracie and Hanna. I love the quiet innocence of Gracie and the quirkiness of Hanna. I wasn't too sure about Alex, but of course I fell in love with him too.<br /><br />At times this book reminded me a lot of the Hunger Games with the Regulators and the relationships between the two main characters. I would definitely recommend this book to everyone that loves dystopian books. When I finished the book last night, the last thing I said, with tears in my eyes, was \\"WOW\\" and I am glad I read the book. I thought about it for a while after finishing it. I will say that I am most definitely looking forward to the second book and curious to see what happens with the characters. I know the first of some books just gets you acquainted with the plot and the characters so I think the next one is going to be amazing!
193413712X|5.0|As a fellow writer, I can say that I learn from reading this celebrated first novel by Paul Harding. It teaches by example how a book can be. The fact that it was published by a \\"small\\" literary press and went on to win the Pulitzer Prize gives me cause to celebrate as well. The New York Times ignored it till it won the Pulitzer because...it was from a small press. In my eyes the small presses are the real hope for literature today. Thanks for this fine book as an example and a work of art.

B004GJYROG|5.0|Our 4 year old son just loved this movie so much that we got the DVD for him so he could watch it anytime he wanted.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|When I picked up this book, it was the only thing on my mind when I wasn't able to read it.  Collins makes us see step by step of the world of panem and the hunger games.  The stress of Katniss as she goes through the stress of entering the Hunger games and not getting killed.  Katniss goes through the Capitol with the feels of diffrent lifestyle between there and her own district.  Katniss goes through her own stress and realizes that these games are more than entertainment.  She insults the capitol some times.  The description of Collins work makes us feel that we are right next to Katniss expieriancing everything she expieriances and feels what she feels.  I think that if you enjoy science fiction or survival, this is a best choice for you.  This book is espcecially powerful because of the beautiful imagery.
B004NO03E2|4.0|Number one on the lengthy list of things Havok has going for them is that they manage to capture the classic 80's thrash sound while still sounding original and fresh. Rather than being just another Metallica knock-off devoid of any originality, Havok have developed their own style of thrash: one that is fast, heavy, and intense. And it's just what the mortician ordered. While I think Time Is Up, the follow-up release to their debut album Burn, is more crisp and flows better than its predecessor, not to mention its vast assortment of riffs and improved drumming, I was slightly disappointed with it at the same time.<br /><br />My main qualm with Time Is Up is its opening three tracks. While none are \\"bad\\" songs by any means, they are far weaker than the other seven tracks featured on the album. Anyone who enjoys a good thrash album knows the opening track, if not the first two or three, are key to setting the tone for the rest of the disc. Havok fails to do so here, as \\"Prepare For Attack,\\" the opener, ends up being the most standard track Havok has written to date. Due to the next two tracks, \\"Fatal Intervention\\" and \\"No Amnesty,\\" also being fairly average, Time Is Up fails to deliver the powerful first round blow one would expect from a killer thrash album.<br /><br />Fortunately, \\"D.O.A.\\" turns up the nastiness four tracks into the album with its daunting harmonies and excellent drumming. This beast of a song concludes with a Slayer-esque assault of riffage and a genuine Araya scream from frontman and guitarist David Sanchez. Next up is \\"Covering Fire,\\" another standout that I believe should have opened the album. This one will knock out your teeth and proceed to kick you while you're down. \\"Killing Tendencies\\" follows with an anvil for a main riff and the catchiest chorus on the album. It also features another sick harmony and a deadly solo from new lead guitarist Reece Scruggs. Of all the songs on Time Is Up, this one gets stuck in my head the most.<br /><br />Following this trio of killers is \\"Scumbag in Disguise,\\" which I feel is the track most representative of Havok's own signature style. While other songs borrow ideas from thrashers such as Slayer or Exodus, this one is all Havok. \\"The Cleric\\" is possibly the most intense song on the album, again featuring morbid harmonies, chugging riffs, and ingenious bass from Jesse De Los Santos. Unfortunately, \\"The Cleric\\" also features a direct lift of a riff from the Megadeth song \\"Ashes in Your Mouth\\" 3:22 into the song. Whether intentional or not (I'd guess not; it's a very simple riff), I noticed and mentally docked points for unoriginality.<br /><br />\\"Out of My Way\\" makes up for this mild offense, though, as it is another time bomb of a track that includes a powerful breakdown and more filthy bass lines from Jesse. Finally, we get to the album closer and my personal favorite track on the album, \\"Time Is Up.\\" It opens with more bass, some power chords, a simple riff, and then we're off! The main riff demands head-banging; the solos demand destruction. Not only is this one apocalyptic musically, it's home to the best lyrics and chorus on the album. Though Havok may have failed to open the album with a punch, they hit me in the face with a shovel at the end.<br /><br />All in all, the tracks on Time Is Up mesh better than those on Burn, and the sophomore effort is smoother as a whole. Where it fails, of course, is in the first three tracks. Because these aren't of much interest to me and end up skipped at times, I'm left with only seven tracks totaling a half hour of thrash. These seven are all outstanding, but they don't constitute the entire album. Had Havok thrown a couple extra tracks on the album and mixed up the order of the songs, I may be writing a five star review- but they didn't. Despite its flaws, though, Time Is Up remains a definite four star album containing some incredible thrash, and I will continue to recommend Havok to anyone who enjoys metal.ollowing this trio of killers is \\"Scumbag in Disguise,\\" which I feel is the track most representative of Havok's own signature style.

B000001DVD|5.0|A year after releasing their debut, Def Leppard teams up with successful record producer Mutt Lange and \\"High `N' Dry\\" comes out in 1981. \\"High `N' Dry\\" will be much more enjoyable to those who are fans of metal and hard rock and are less into the more pop and polished \\"Pyromania\\" and \\"Hysteria\\" albums (even if I love both of these album). This was the first Def Leppard album producer Mutt Lange did with the band who would have a huge influence on the band, so much as to even be called \\"the sixth Def Leppard\\". Lange definitely has had a impact on the band and was a big part of their eventual success by helping define the sound they would become famous for. Joe Elliot's voice has changed since the first album, it's higher here and noticeably different. \\"High `N' Dry\\" is also the last album to feature guitarist Pete Willis who would be replaced by Phil Collen. This album shows improvement over the last album, I really like \\"On Through The Night\\" because it shows the earlier and raw Def Leppard that sounds like NWOBHM (that's New Wave Of British Heavy Metal for the uninitiated) and the band at its early stage and sounds almost nothing like their trademark sound. With \\"High `N' Dry\\" it was time for the band to change a little and make themselves different from the other NWOBHM bands and they did. Def Lepp sound more melodic on this one and they started to develop their trademark sound here. The best way to describe the album is that it still has a very hard-rock/metal feel and sound but with some prominent melodies and more gang (and pop like) choruses.<br /><br />On \\"High 'N' Dry\\" the band still sounds somewhat raw, energetic and rocking. Granted the band's debut On Through The Night (a very underrated album in this reviewer's humble opinion) is heavier, rawer and to the point but I feel that \\"High `N' Dry\\" is overall a stronger and better album. The band sounds better for one, Joe's voice shows improvement from the debut and the musicianship is better as well. Lange did plant the seed for what the sound of the band would become which is evident from the very first song \\"Let It Rock\\" with the trademark back vocals the band would become famous for.  I'm not going to go through every song but I'll give my comments on a few of them.<br /><br />There is the powerful and amazing (yet still rocking) ballad \\"Bringin' On The Heartbreak\\" which was probably at this point the first power ballad and to me this is the best ballad Def Leppard has done, rivaled only by \\"Love Bites\\" and \\"Hysteria\\". It's really with their follow-up, \\"Pyromania\\" that the band went into a more commercial and pop direction, this one has teeth and edge to this and it's a lot more metal sounding. The title track \\"High `N' Dry\\" is a highlight, this one is very AC/DC sounding (what did you expect? Mutt Lange also produced AC/DC and besides the Aussies were a big influence on Def Leppard), pure classic rock. Those who think Def Leppard is a little too \\"clean\\" on latter albums might be pleasantly surprised with those lyrics, great song. \\"Switch 625\\" is an instrumental song, now I'll admit that I'm usually not a fan of instrumentals (with exceptions like Iron Maiden's \\"Transylvania\\" and Rush' \\"YYZ\\") but I love this one, the playing is so tight and it's just a killer rocking song.  \\"Lady Strange\\" is an excellent song with a terrific riff and a catchy chorus, works for me I really like this one. \\"On Through The Night\\" sounds like it could have been on (you guessed it!) the band's debut, also called \\"On Through The Night\\". \\"Mirror, Mirror (Look Into My eyes)\\" is one of the more aggressive songs, the pop-ish chorus is back by a solid guitar riff, one of my favorite songs from \\"High `N' Dry\\".<br /><br />Later releases of \\"High `N' Dry\\" featured two bonus songs: two remixes of \\"Bringin' On The Heartbreak\\" (This one has added keyboard which does make it sound slightly different, especially during the chorus) and a B-Side \\"Me And My Wine\\"(always cool to get unreleased stuff, solidrock `n' roll, not bad at all).<br /><br />I would consider \\"High `N' Dry\\" one of Def Leppard's best albums. As mentioned earlier, here they still have a hard rock edge but it's blended nicely with more melody and pop-ish choruses which makes for an excellent Def Lepp album. Maybe I enjoy it more because the songs didn't receive nearly as much airplay as \\"Pyromania\\" or `Hysteria\\" did and the band sounds better than on their debut album. \\"High `N' Dry\\" is not one the band's most successful albums but it's certainly one of those I enjoy the most. If you're less into the glam/pop-metal sound the band is usually known for I think you would enjoy the band's first two albums a lot more. To me this is where Def Leppard really became Def Leppard, and I've got to give credit to Mutt Lange as he was very involved. \\"High `N' Dry\\" is an excellent album and one that should not be overlooked or ignored because of the band's more famous albums, I highly recommend this one 5/5.at all).

159420229X|5.0|I loved this book.  I feel it is extremely difficult to discuss the scientific side of memorization in a way that is interesting and comprehensible to most readers.  Foer did a great job alternating between this, the practical applications of his techniques, and the theory and \\"art\\" of memorization.      His writing style is clear and precise, which makes for an easy read.  The book itself seems to be a bit repetitive at times; however, I think this is just a function of how memorization works.  It seems like Foer really cares about his audience remembering at least bits and pieces from the book.  He often mentions how fleeting memories of books are, something I find especially true.  Oftentimes, I cannot even remember a main character's name.  If nothing else, this book makes us aware of what we are forgetting and why.      I feel this book is attractive to people because everyone wants to read more, remember more.  We keep books on our shelves to show what we've read, like some externalization of our knowledge and understanding.  Foer addresses this desire in people in an entirely relevant and earnest manner.  My only problem with the book is his occasional self-importance, though I suppose this is only natural when discussing successes.  However, he also has enough humbling experiences to be relatable and fills his book with astoundingly entertaining anecdotes and ideas.

B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|I have loved HAWAII 5-0  ever since the Pilot which I watched at SUNSET ON THE BEACH in Waikiki. It was really gripping from the first  \\"BOOM\\" and the sound of the iconic theme song.I still love it!!The cast is perfectly picked and totally believable as STEVE, DANNO, CHIN and KONO and are very ably supported by guest stars and regulars. This series has it all. Gorgeous actors, great writers,suspense,action,sex appeal and magnificent scenery!!!!In fact it is an instant Hawaiian holiday-with punch !!!!
B001UV4XHY|5.0|It seems like the movie did a decent following of the book. But there where things I would have to go back to the book and look at. Who was getting married. It really couldn't have been Genny Wesley and Harry because that was only revealed in the post log of the book after Harry's death and coming back to life. Now, I didn't remember that Mad Eye Moody was killed at the beginning of the 7th book. Like I said I am going to have to go and re-read the 7th book again because there is so much I don't remember. I do vaguely remember one of the Wesley twins dying. Like I said back to the book. Re-read and re-read again and again.
B001NEK2GE|2.0|Purchased this looking to add space for extra keybinds (using Bartender4) in WoW, while being able to keep all the default keybinds intact.  When you plug it in, it remaps the keys on the unit to copy ones already on the keyboard.  If you just want things compacted..win. But if like me, you were hoping to just be able to keep things in game as they should be, while adding keys just for the things you need, this isn't what you will want to purchase.<br />Since they post this unit as for use with WoW they really should be more specific imo about what it does functionally so more people do not make this mistake.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I never really looked at this one in the movie theater or on TV. I decided to get this one from the bargain bin at Block Busters. After I did I am glad I did. This movie was total different than the Kirk and Spock time and and really different than the Picard and Ricker time. If I remember about this one it was suppose to be before Spock and Kirks time. I really never knew. So, I really can't say anything about this movie other than I watched it and I liked it.

B004498KPU|3.0|Well I am really surprised with the packaging and the 60 page great book.    The weight of the box set give a impression of that this DVD set is expensive.    I brought this for Rs. 3,500.00 (about us$37.00).    One thing I was really dissapointed was that all the music videos plays with two black bars (left & right). Only 3 or 4 music videos plays with the full screen length. I am using a Panasonic 37\\" widescreen LCD with a JVC 5.1 home theater system. I would say the sound quality has been improved alot comparing to previous music video DVDs released for Michale Jackson.    Overall I am happy with the DVD, but I would be much delighted if the videos were in 16:9 screen size to suite any TV, LCD or LED.    Zurakim Taip  Kandy, Sri Lanka

B004UC1WN8|5.0|Every song is fantastic and for the first time you really don't want to skip a track.   On The Floor - The lead single.Catchy chorus,simple lyrics = perfect pop song. A duet with Pitbull,it samples Lambada and it is produced by Redone, what more could we ask for in a pop record? 10/10  Good Hit -  is really catchy, a sing-a-long song. (laaa laaa laaaa) 8/10  I'm Into You - is not a crowd-pleaser like On The Floor,but it is definetly one of Jennifer's best songs,summer smash.  9/10  Papi - This is hands down, no question, the album highlight and it'll be MONSTER single for her. Lets Get Loud of 2011. Guaranteed hit. 10/10  Villain - This song shows off the potential of what the 'Love?' album. Its mature,it's melodic,its lush. It's a dark song, but there is beauty here as well. One of my favorites. 10/10   Hypnotico - The song is a bit out of her usual, it is wonderful. Its Gaga,but it's also JLo. Jennifer closing down the album with one of the best tracks.    Love? is amazing album,Go out an buy it, it is a classic...

0345529057|5.0|These books are excellent. I bought the box set from Amazon at a great price, but when I got the books, they were really small, so I borrowed my brothers nook with the books on it to read them. For anyone that doesn't like to read small print, or that has adult sized hands, I would suggest finding these in another format. Maybe borrow an ebook from someone on your nook or kindle...<br /><br />The books are great though! Please ignore the people complaining about the price giving the books bad reviews, they don't realize that they are rating the product and not the seller, when will Amazon start banning these crap reviews rating the sellers?<br /><br />I'm not a big fan of fantasy books, but I saw the series for these on HBO and it was really good, so I wanted to read the books which are always better than the TV as they have more details. There is a lot of sexual content in these, so they are not for kids, but for the adult reader I would highly recommend them since the story is a great story and it keeps you hooked.<br /><br />Edit 7/18/11: Just finished all four books yesterday and they are amazing! I've never been so attached to characters and fell so deep into a story. This is a great series. Starting the fifth book now!
B004INNRFK|3.0|\\"The Hit Man Returns\\" is ok.  Some of it I really LOVED.  My complaint with this cd is that the sound quality is poor.  There are several tracts where there is static.  I first thought something was wrong with my sound system, but when I checked, this was not the problem.  Whoever set up the sound reproduction for this cd was not paying attention.  I LOVE David Foster... in my opinion, he is the Best thing that ever happened to the music industry in our generation.
0891419063|5.0|There are many other great reviews of this excellent book already in place, but having finished it, I felt moved to write my own. I can only imagine how horrific it must be to serve on the frontline in any war. Some books convey that horror better than others. Guy Sajer's iconic account of WW2 German army life on the Russian front, [[ASIN:1574882864 The Forgotten Soldier]], is without doubt one of the best. But this book can stand proudly, four square alongside it.<br /><br />The author, Eugene Sledge, kept illicit notes of his experiences on the islands of Pelelieu and Okinawa, and later used them to write this book. Written in an unassuming but compelling way, it lays out in horrifying detail the depravities of modern war, and the depths to which man can stoop when surrounded by utter carnage. Those with weak stomachs, stay away. I still have some of the images that I read about engraved in my mind's eye. Yet the book is not just about violence. It's also about the comradeship and love that the soldiers felt for each other, and the humor they used to help them survive.<br /><br />It's an incredible read. I heard about the book because of the HBO miniseries [[ASIN:B001IBIHQ4 The Pacific]]. I'm currently reading another book, written by a contemporary of Sledge's, Robert Leckie. [[ASIN:0553593315 Helmet for My Pillow]] is another absorbing read, although it's written in an entirely different style. Like other reviewers, I've also wondered why there aren't more accounts of WW2 by British soldiers. I've read the brilliant [[ASIN:0393334988 Railway Man]] by Eric Lomax, but not seen much else. Thanks to Amazon's lists, I've recently come across [[ASIN:047142627X First Light]], an account of the Battle of Britain, by Geoffrey Wellum, a former RAF fighter pilot. I aim to read it soon, and hope and expect that it will live up to the American books.<br /><br />Ben Kane, author of The Forgotten Legion.
B000ASATZ8|3.0|Well I bouhght movies cause I liked the first two, the other movies didn't knew about them, so Ithoguht this would be a good oportunity to have a collection, so I ordered.  My dissapointment was on the third movie, which doesn't have subtitles, I mean, I understand english (I think that) but I think this an entertaiment, so it is better to have it on my language; if I wanted to practice my english, I'll take lessons.  After that everything is great.
0316056863|5.0|So I already wanted to read this book when I heard about it, for one it's Tina Fey, for two, she's super funny as hell and for three, I think she is the smartest woman I don't know.  So when a coworker told me she bought the book and read it and that she'd lend it to me but she sent it to her sister first I was cool with that.  I planned on buying the book anyhow...because I want it apart of my permanent collection of books I love.  So after work Friday I didn't necessarily set off on a trek to find this book, it was a VERY HAPPY accident...VERY HAPPY!!!  So Friday after work, I am trailing through Ferndale, a very hip little city with a Rosie O'Grady's and I'm just walking down the street, checked out a vintage clothing store (NOTHING IN SEASON BY THE WAY), I also went to...well almost went to a tattoo shop because I definitely know which tattoo is next for me, but I'll just wait for my friend to accompany me for that excursion.  So anyhow because I have a fondness for books that I want to read, I happened across the Used Book Store on 9 mile.  I walk in and I immediately think about a book I would possibly want to buy but I just couldn't think of the author or the title of the book I just knew it was Aesop Fableish but I couldn't tell the manager that, he wouldn't know what I was thinking in my head, so I abandoned that thought, and I came across the section of 'NEW BOOKS' and there she was BOSSYPANTS herself!!!!!!!! I was so happy, happening across this HAPPY ACCIDENT, VERY HAPPY ACCIDENT, of course.  And so I started the book on Friday night (YES THAT IS HOW I SPEND MY FRIDAY'S) sometimes :) and I finished the book late afternoon early evening on Sunday.  I bought the hardcover and I want all the women to reread as I have and even mark page 144 in the hardcover.  It is a very strong life lesson.    I thought the book was funny, smart, courageous, humble in some instances...just like Tina.  I'm going to reread it again, before I loan it to my cousin, but this time it will NOT take years for her to return a book to me; as she did with the John Douglas book which was autographed by the way.  I want this one back.    I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK, but I don't think I need to twist ANY ARMS to faithful Tina Fey loyalist!

A new harvest cycle means a change of menu, and Jamie's book has it right there, simple and quick from garden to table. This is REAL food. You can taste the love in it!    With growing tips, gorgeous photos and variations for each type of harvest, this is the perfect book for gardeners and cooks alike.    P.S. The Speedy Rhubarb fool is to die for! We exchange the rhubarb for peaches or whatever else is in season....heaven!

0143038419|1.0|This book is terrible, and the movie is even worse. It deserves the single star (if I could give it none I would) for the reasons that every one who has given it that rating has noted. It is trite, it is vain, it is painfully solipsistic, and Oprah (my heroine!) should receive an epic fail for co-signing this mess. Beyond the \\"Privileged White Lady Blues\\" that this story espouses, what really got to me was that there was no context for her misery. Therefore there was no story to connect to. The book and subsequently the movie were nothing more than a travel diary. Gilbert insisted on keeping some things private about why her relationship deteriorated and was even more elusive about the unraveling of her romance with David. So the very reason for her journey to self-discovery is never truly known. There's no reason for the audience to feel invested in her road to recovery because we had no idea what the heck she was recovering from. If you are going to put your life story on print and in film, then don't be coy all of a sudden. I'm surprised any editor would let this memoir go to print without encouraging the writer to bare their soul. Further more, I'm shocked that this book received so much hype. Tsk Tsk.

I think it was well written and inspite of some reviews I have seen was largely factual. I think the author did a great job in telling the story which the Lacks family should be proud of. The research completed for this book was done well and the facts are presented in a clear manner. This truly was a great piece of history to read.
0307463745|4.0|I read a lot of negative reviews or reviews saying that the book wasn't worth it.  I decided that I enjoyed reading their blog and I'd give it a shot anyway.  I feel it was worth it.  It was a quick read but that was ok.  I've got a hectic life so I could read a quick \\"mini-chapter\\" or two very quickly.
0793518326|5.0|I just received this, so I have only first impressions to give.<br /><br />I agree with other reviewers that the type is incredibly small and a bit difficult (but not impossible) to read.  However, as it is a huge book that includes the scoring for all the instrumentation and vocals, I sort of expected this.<br /><br />Lets face it, this is not something you take to a gig and hoist up on a music stand in front of you!<br /><br />I see no problem with scanning and enlarging the print!<br /><br />Some of the other reviewers have pointed out that this does not include every single song recorded by the Beatles, just the ones that they wrote.<br /><br />I don't feel like going through every one of my old Beatles' LPs (I have the complete Beatles catalog on vinyl as well as copies in CD)  But going through the table of contents, its clear this includes a huge number on non-Beatles penned songs.  This includes Carl Perkins' numbers such as Matchbox, as well as some very old songs such as those included on the U.S. \\"Early Beatles\\" LP.  E.g. \\"Anna\\", \\"Chains\\", \\"Bad Boy\\" etc.  So it possibly is missing some very old non-Beatles penned tunes, but I don't think there are very many missing.<br /><br />If this book is missing some few songs, I suspect there were licensing issues that could not be resolved.  So I see no reason to ding the product for this minor imperfection.<br /><br />I bought this for the Beatles songs,  and in particular, for the Sitar and Indian instrumentation, which this has.  I have been playing the main melody lines for Norwegian Woods and Within You Without You on Sitar, mostly by ear and memory.  But some of the instrumental parts in WYWY that are played by the Dilruba (Indian Violin) have been illusive for me.<br /><br />Although they are labeled as \\"violin\\", this does appear to be the Dilruba parts, so I should be able to easily translate to Sitar.<br /><br />I will update this review if I feel I need to modify it, but right now this appears to be what I was looking for, and well worth the (rather large) expense, as there is no where else to get this information.<br /><br />I suspect that if you play in a Beatles cover band, this would be invaluable.I was looking for, and well worth the (rather large) expense, as there is no where else to get this information.<br /><br />I suspect that if you play in a Beatles cover band, this would be invaluable.
