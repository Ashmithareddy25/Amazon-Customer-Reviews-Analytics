B00CWY76CC|5.0|I think it's amazing it's so fun it's challenging and it's like a little quiz<br />And trust me I'm not the smartest person
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love Downton Abbey.  Saving the last of the season just because I want to know there is still an episode for me to watch.  Not ready to see the season end yet.
B006IGZWB2|3.0|While some of the storyline may indeed be historically accurate , I do not think that all of it was .  I was also quiet repulsed by the &#34;pie incident &#34;.  In my mind there is no excuse for retaliation on this level . I think I would have done more than dismiss this maid. I believe I would have hurt her or at the very least involved the police .
B003PVPXOE|5.0|This film makes me wish I could articulate my compliments more properly. The usual \\"great acting, great writing, great directing\\" simply won't do.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Watched the first season cuz I'd heard good things about the series,watched one after another, on to Season Two, then HAD to watch Season Three, which left me waiting for more! The season three cliffhanger can't possibly lead us into a situation as bad as it looks, can it? Not sure I could accept that . . .
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I have played many games like this one, but I'm enjoying this one more. Possibility due to my love of dragons. I feel like the other poster on here than the economy is very well balanced. If you like the theme park type games this one is for you.
0156030306|5.0|This is a true American classic! Nominated as the monthly read for my Atlanta book club, Flowers for Algernon provides ample discussion material while presenting life lessons in easily digestible format. The story of Charlie Gordon is not one to be soon forgotten. If this wasn't on your \\"required reading\\" list in high school, hurry up and order your copy now!
B00BCA29WY|5.0|These guys are a real breath of fresh air. While the Genesis and Yes influences are clear, they've got plenty of their own style in the mix. Brilliant instrumental work with some wonderful vocal harmonies.
B0040I09RM|5.0|This show is like getting on the most extreme roller coaster. It grabs you and refuses to let you go.
B009NX3U20|5.0|This is the best personal camera perspective movie I've seen since the Blaire Witch Project.  I didn't care if it got more and more outlandish.  Once I was in, I was in.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|A well-written story of stories of worlds within worlds and realities within dreams within dreams that are real. Bravo! bravo!
B00AB7HESI|1.0|This app closes out all the time for no reason, just like the Iphone app! I thought surely the android app would work better. Great game, terrible app.
B00BV1OT0O|5.0|I just love minnions!  I have ordered several of the pieces,  and love them all.  They are boxed for collection - but very nicely made.  Everytime I look at them,  they make me smile.  What more can you ask?
0670026603|5.0|I started and finished this book in one day, staying up till midnight. Louisa and Will's relationship sucks you in and does not let go. This book did make me tear up but it's not sad as much as it's a book that will stick with you and hold a place in your heart forever. Louisa gets hired by Will's mother to be a companion for Will whos became a quadriplegic after an accident. The moment I fell in love with Will was when he attended Louisa's birthday party at her parents house. The story is mostly told through Louisa. A couple of chapters are told by Will's parents of Nathan, Will's home care nurse. I haven't read any books by Jojo Moyes before but she will be added to my authors I must read list because she tells a story beautifully.
B004A8ZWVK|4.0|Has fun but covers serious topics .not a complete chick flick.Tween and up .aptures the feeling of the era well.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I have seen the live theater performance at least 5 times, and I enjoyed it tremendously each time.  But I must say this award-winning movie version is the best telling of the story ever! It's so well-acted by all of the actors - they bring each character to life. And I never knew that Hugh Jackman, Anne Hathaway, and Russell Crowe were such wonderful singers. The casting was spot on, the directing was superb, and the costume design and cinematography were awesome! I would recommend this movie to anyone.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so fun and entertaining. Great for the summer when you're bored. Recommend it for anybody of all ages.
0786955570|5.0|I can't count the number of hours that my friends and I have poured into this game.  Definitely a very good buy for anyone with a group of friends interested in this.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game make my children enjoy and love to play it.<br />myself also enjoy it. it is good free game.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I love this game and I post the things I like about it but it could be changed so in your park you can breed your dinosaurs and make different kinds and so you can have more than one kind of dinosaur
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The game is great and it is lots of fun! Hopefully the downloading stuff stops in the future of the game!
B00A757EFW|4.0|I like this game it reminds me of the 80's when I would go to an arcade and play this game for hours.
0425263916|5.0|This book was amazing and I can't wait to read many more books by Sylvia Day! I suggest this to anyone who likes a food romance novel
B00E38KGF4|5.0|Fast scans. Does not seem to have any adverse affects on my Kindle fire HD..<br />Hope Bitdefender Mobile Security is added to the Kindle app store..
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Fun if u love bingo u like this game I love.  GAME PLAY A LOT LOTS OF DIFFERENT GAMES HIGH MARKS
B0037B6QSY|5.0|On of the best meditation books I've read from a completely western viewpoint.  The author explains what I think is essentially Zen meditation but in pure western terms, cleansed of the buddhist riddles and other layers (not that Zen is bad but because it can be confusing).
B006LSZECO|3.0|I almost put this one down....it finally picks up at the midway point and makes the story interesting.  I, personally did not like the ending either.  Just a personal thing.  Worth reading, as it was recommended to me but not on my top ten for summer reading.
B00C81LYH2|3.0|I love Barbies, and always lust after the holiday doll, so I was happy to get this one from Vine.  However, in comparison to other holiday Barbies, this one just doesn't seem quite as special.  Fashion-wise, the silver snowflake dress doesn't really do it for me, and the diamond jewels are kind of typical.  No wow factor here.  However, it's certainly a beautiful Barbie, and my younger sister was quite pleased to add it to her collection.
B003F44QRQ|4.0|Just showed this movie to my kids and they loved it.  They've been into iconic 80's movies lately and this one is still entertaining after all these years.  Love Diane Weist!
B0036BK6MW|5.0|A look at life through sports that can have have a broad appeal<br />to our young people - and even adults.  I heartily recommend it.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|IT'S GOING TO BE MADE INTO A MOVIE...BUT ASIDE FROM THAT....IT IS  PAGE TURNER!!! I JUST BOUGHT THE BOOK SHE WROTE BEFORE THAT! AND IT'S GREAT TOO! HAVEM'T FINISHED IT THOUGH
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|But am a fan of fine acting. While I cringe at the status stuff, I think this is about a good a portrayal as it can get.
B004X6PRO6|3.0|The story was informative but the subject grim.  The book was engaging, the quality of the writing was good.  The subject matter was unpleasant.  I would not have picked this book to read, my book group picked it.  I did learn something about how bad things are in North Korea.
B002DQLGHU|1.0|Really, who said this was good? Just sat down to watch this much hyped movie...unbelievable! This movie is boring...even my two teenagers didn't waste time on it. We turned it off before we had seen even a third of it.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this movie and I think the hokey special effects are very dated...guess they may have been good in their time.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|Loads of good fun.  Sometimes some of the levels are frustrating due to the necessary cards popping up, but it's still a great deal of fun for hours on end!
B0026772N8|5.0|Halfway thru right now and I'm definitely enjoying this book. Only downside is I don't have a kindle so I read it on my phone. that has nothing to do with the book though!
0553386816|4.0|In Ford County, Grisham brings to life seven short but powerful stories, full of deep emotions. Not one of them has a hero, a star. They have plenty of human characters, with ambiguities and frailties. It's drama but somtimes conveys a strange sense of humor, found in despair and in the absurdity of the human condition. For me it was refreshing to read all these stories, from Ford County, a very distant place. Quick read, yet of very good quality. Recommended.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I like it so far but only time will tell how well it performs. Ooh de lalli. Neat graphics and story
B00CXQL828|5.0|Holy s*** this is good!  I was pleasantly surprised.  I bought it expecting a good, solid hard rock album, but wow!.  Very few albums grab me in the first listen...this one did.  Get it.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|I loved this book.<br /><br />It's raw and honest and at times you feel like he's writing it after zero sleep and 5 red bulls...  but all in all, a wonderful book!<br /><br />Thanks, James...
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Game is great and simple just like owning a horse u get involved but no Haskell of doing the work.
B000JO9JHW|5.0|Had to rewatch the first season since we are now in the last.  I will most definitely miss this show.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|After the first book...wasn't sure I wanted to read the other two....someone suggested I did to grasp the entire story....I'm so glad I did....Unforgettable....difficult to explain if you haven't read it....there's so much more to the story than what non-readers of the trilogy could ever understand....Highly recommend....
B007THA4FI|5.0|all the hype and then controversy over the reception of the new book made me get aroud to reading this one.  so glad i did  i'll never forget it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really enjoyed the levels I have played. it can be very mind boggling.  for being a free game it was better than I expected.  try it... you will like it!
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|What is making me upset is the fact that I went to buy pearls and it took my money but never gave me pearls!!!!!!! Other than that its fine.
B000A6T1JU|3.0|I bought this film because I thought it would be like The Outsiders. In some ways it is and in some ways it's just bizarre. I gave it an OK rating because I thought it would be better than what it was. It's not a terrible film but for those who love a good gang film might be a little disappointed in this one.<br /><br />THX,<br />Kris L. CocKayne
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I could not put this novel down --  I was reading it literally until the sun came up.  For a fantastic, heart-rending journey, submerge yourself in Ocean.
1451695195|5.0|Very good book and it ties in with  other books like it.  I will pass it on to others in my family.
B002MG2ATY|5.0|The coup-de-tat that occurred on that fateful day in November 1963 has culminated in our new world order of never ending war for profit, privatized military, militarized police departments and politicians who are mere puppets of the Military Industrial Complex in a never-ending charade of democracy every four years. This was the turning point in our nation, when the true powers-that-be decided to exert their control over us. The rotating merry-go-round of enemies since then has kept our once great fourth estate busy ginning us up with ever sickening nationalistic propaganda. Telling us who to hate and who to kill. Now that our government has total surveillance over us and the unbridled power to kill any one of us and the first, fourth and fifth amendments have been rendered impotent by a corporatized court system feeding hungry for profit prisons with more and more of us we are fast approaching another crucial moment in our nation's path. Are we to be nothing but serfs slaving for the corporation or will there be a resurgence of human spirit that usurps the traitors from our national shrines? We'll see. But Oliver Stone has lit the match with this movie. He has thrown down the gauntlet in front of a nation fat and fast asleep in front of our TV's. JFK is a remarkable achievement that should be shown in history classrooms across our nation.
B000HSKUBE|5.0|In my opinion this version is even better than the American show though I loved it too. The acting is great in both
B00A81MV3U|5.0|It respects the mentally ill yet provides thoughtful entertainment.<br />I saw it 3 times in the theatre than bought it.
0425220931|5.0|I'm probably a bit different from others who've read this book in that I had no idea who Victor Wooten was before I read this book.  I was attracted to it by the title, which sparked interest in me as a musician and writer who is always seeking artistic and spiritual growth.  This book inspired me on so many levels and is one that I re-read from time to time when I need to take my creativity back to its elementary form.<br /><br />I've since become very familiar with VW as a musician and bassist and have seen him live a couple of times.  I certainly recommend this book to any musician or artist in general who is looking for a  different perspective on creativity from one of the masters of the craft of musicianship.<br />[[ASIN:B00BV4VH56 Kayla & Eli Discover Jazz]]
B00DP3IGJ6|5.0|2nd time watching it and it's even better.  You catch things you missed on the first viewing.  Have to admit that I'm a diehard scifi lover and gamer.  Aspects of this movie remind me of the MMO EVE Online which made it that much more pleasurable.  I need more movies like this.
B00BK5D95C|5.0|I'm not a huge fan of the electronic sound that seems to be all the rage right now - but I can't listen to this album enough.  I love the pretty much everything about this album - the intrumentation, the vocals, the entire mood of the album is fantastic.
B00ALQSY2Y|5.0|This BBC series is chocked full of information and great animation.  My granddaughter is 4 and loves Planet Dinosaur. I thought it was too far beyond her understanding, but she gets it all and can tell me details days later. We're currently on our first time though the series, but I know it's only the first of many viewings. I'd recommend this series to anyone who yearns to see dinosaurs in action.
B00BTHV05M|4.0|Catchy pop music, nicely upbeat.  A album to include on a summer road trip - nothing earth-shattering, but pretty enjoyable stuff.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|It is one thing to read snapshots of what it is like to live in North Korea; another to read an entire book.  Well worth the time and a real eye-opener.
B00C27LB20|4.0|I really love the retro sound, I'm pretty excited to hear more from this guy.  I hear the obvious likeness to Tallest Man on Earth, but that didn't diminish my enjoyment of this album.
B00BQPEIT2|2.0|I did not like this game. I don't like games that take you on a long journey.The play idea just wasn't for me.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I don't watch much tv, but I've been hooked since the first episode I watched!  Tons of unexpected twists and turns.
B004SUWR2C|3.0|I prefer to play this game with a group of people so I can interact with them. On my Kindle it was not fun for me to play. I think card games are ment to be played with 2 or more people.
B003P2WO5E|4.0|The beginning of a series (&#34;Stormlight&#34;), in which a fantasy world will be gradually revealed and explained.  Sanderson does a good job of moving the story along, with characters we care about and intriguing features of an imagined world.  At times the dance of the seven veils gets a bit tiresome as he keeps dropping hints and reminders without actually telling what is going on, but the plot is well paced and the conflict pulls you in nicely.<br />Sanderson has earned a reputation for intriguing inventiveness and regular excitement, but he does not deliver significance, which some of us will always hope for in fantasy.  So far, Stormllight compares favorably with Mistborn on richness of the world and the complexity of the characters' challenges, but does not manage the suspense of the other series.  Still there are some nice plot twists, including waves of them as the end approaches, and few readers will get seriously bogged down if they care for this sort of thing at all.  My main concern is whether you will consider it worthwhile at the end - I did, but not because it offers anything to stay with a person.
B008476HBM|5.0|A sublime read... Jane Austen's characters are intriguing and thoroughly enjoyable.  An excellent author and wonderful book (and wonderful to have on Kindle!).
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I like the gru rocket and the overall game is very fun I just want enough coins to buy the ninja I give it a five star rating
B008MU8ZOI|4.0|The monster is great, original, and very different. The plot builds without the gore we're so used to, to tell a good story.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a good game for its age group. I love it even though im older than 7. AWESOMESAUCE GAME!!!!!
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Classic adventure through and through. I grew up on these films and they have spanned my lifetime. Strong characters in each one.
B006ZPJWBM|5.0|So relaxing and makes a boring drive in the car a true pleasure.  I can't wait to share this with my friends and family.  I mean what can you say about Tony Bennett that people don't already know?  He's so great.................enough said.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|This was the most amazing performance we have ever seen.  We have seen &#34;Phantom&#34; live, about 5 times around the nation and always enjoyed it.  This performance and the filming of it was the best.  We were able to see up close the emotions of the characters.  The &#34;Masquerade&#34; ball was the best one ever and showcased all the performers.  Brilliant, so brilliant we have watched it 3 times in just a couple weeks.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I was really enjoying his version of what went thru his head when he first met Ana. The trilogy took me thru many emotions. I enjoy it so much and did not want it to end.
0142004413|5.0|hilariously funny book, autobiography of Lawrence Durrell's family life on a Greek Island. It is  laugh out loud book about the antics of all the family members and local characters. The author's love of all animals creates a fascinating story of an unusual family living a somewhat nomadic life after the death of their father/husband. Well worth reading, a great summer read.
1781162646|5.0|Loved this book...Stephen King is a consummate storyteller and my favorite books of his books have always been those in which the voice of the narrator rings true and sweet. Joyland is, like Stand By Me, a coming-of-age story delivered with great heart, but still with just enough of the &#34;unexplainable&#34; to stay true to the genre.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|Great book - really interesting to see a side of inmate life that has never been told before. Looking forward to seeing how this is done on Netflix.
B0091WNK8M|5.0|This movie is a classic.  A little drama, some crime scenes, the bad guys and the good guys.  Must watch for kids and any adults with some kid left in them
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is out of the ordinary and a very different kind of romance, and I loved it. It's really good.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so amazing I'm surprised they didn't make us pay for it love all the minions they have and all the battles
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Greg app use it all the time on my phone and my Kindle fire. Helps us to see the weather all over.
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|i bought this to charge my kindle took awhile to get here. and it didn't even work. I wont buy this again
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Lesser humans would have crumbled under the impossible life he had from conception to his freedom.  The book was riveting and I couldn't put it down.
B002ZG993Q|4.0|Have you seen \\"The American\\" starring George Clooney? It is a Focus Films production, so it is very \\"Artsy Fartsy\\" (but, I love that kinda stuff). And it is definitely a full two footed jaunt into the Film Noir genre, but......George Clooney did a fantastic job. Even though he seemed out of his element, he took charge of the role, and shined. He showed the kind of talent required to be rated a top notch actor, true talent which is undesirable in today's \\"Fast Food\\" film industry. Watching this film garnered an new respect within me for Mr.. Clooney, and \\"resparked\\" that deep love within me for great film making. I love it!
B008BU75IQ|5.0|As always in his  novels, there is something to be learned.  In fact the trilogy was well worth the read, as I loved all 3 of theme
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|First off this device is great at what it is supposed to to.  At its heart it basically mirrors a tab from your internet browser to your tv.  Any content that you can play on your browser you can watch on your tv.  In addition it has a few apps netflix and youtube but from using these I have found that the only advantage of using the built in functionality over the in tab version is that with the app you can close your browser or navigate to different pages while watching your content.  Additionally, this device is great at watching local content through plex. Some people have complained that you need to be 20 feet away to stream content and that is not true. You only need to be 20 feet away for the initial set up but after that you can cast videos to your chromcast from anywhere where you have a connection you your wi-fi.  It has some limitations but for the price point, even without the netflix promotion, this is a great device for cord cutters who what to easily stream content to their tv.
B008K6HN8I|1.0|I allowed an ES FIle Explorer update in July of 2013.  There are now more bells and whistles, but I can no longer access half of my network nodes.  Previous version worked well.  I will have to find another application.  The application is useless to me without being able to access all my networks nodes.  App is running on a Droid 2.3.4 (Gingerbread) and network is Windows.<br /><br />I reverted to an earlier version and all the nodes are accessible.  There's definitely a problem with ver 3 on my Droid.
B00785P2QC|5.0|So awesome love it best thing that ever happened to me even better than when I got married play it all the time can't wait to get home
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abbey is a wonderful series to view. The acting, the scenery, the costumes, the locale......all add to it's beauty! I got hooked immediately and can't wait for Season 4. You will enjoy the trials and tribulations of the families represented in these episodes, I am sure. Try it. You won't be disappointed.
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|...album is in my collection. I have always found them to be among the finest musical excursions I could partake of. However, I feel that this is (so far) the best of the bunch. I found myself wanting the songs to never end and when they did, I was sad, until the next song fired up. This is one of the musical endeavors of the ages. I feel it is sure to go down historically, measured against only the finest of rock's history. I was completely satiated and I rarely feel that way about an album. This is truly a great accomplishment. The musicians who were part of this should be most proud indeed. Mr. Homme might find it difficult to achieve this height again. But if he and Mr. Grohl can keep this type of quality coming they should find themselves among the greatest of all time. to be sure, they are already rock royalty. To stay on this trajectory would assure their place in the rock and roll hall of fame. That is how lofty I feel this album is. I hope they have great fun.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|This film received many nominations for the Academy Awards, and rightly so. The actors were spot on in their portrayals, especially Daniel Day-Lewis and Tommy Lee Jones. If you like historical films, you'll love it. Even if you don't prefer historical films, you will enjoy it.
B0043UB0EI|5.0|I loved it! I Couldn't wait to watch each episode and my only disappointment was that it had to end!
0060574216|5.0|This is a book for the ages, and all ages.  Good insights, stories and suggestions for relationships. Humorous and easy to read.
B007ZQJR4M|3.0|The book came in a timely manner and it was brand new as advertised. Amazon is an awesome place to buy products. I expected this book to be better than the movie, but honestly I liked the movie better.
B00821PCJS|4.0|Another show that shows how unprepared that we, as Americans, are when our world changes suddenly. To many commercials as usual.
B003XQM2YU|4.0|It's a really great movie. I recommend it to all Russell Crowe fans or Robin Hood fans. It's a great story, it shows you sort of what Robin Hood did before he became an outlaw.
B00646UU5Y|2.0|After watching all of the British shows it was a real letdown when the new shows came on. Stopped watching.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|tells me I need wifi connection to upgrade I do have it but app still wont upgrade its been a pain and keeps freezing on my phone and certain books wont open when I want to read them
B0091REZMW|4.0|Strangely addictive, a little annoying that there is so much to pay for. Could play for hours however, energy runs out too quick and not enough free diamonds.
0062209078|4.0|I listened to the audio book version and I loved the fact that it was read by the author. To me an audiobook that isn't read by the living author has less relevance so even though I'm a mild Who fan it made the book that much more interesting.<br /><br />I have read books about rock stars for over 25 years and am reading them less and less because they're all so similar but Pete Townshend's life, and road to stardom, was vastly different than others in the same business.<br /><br />Great listen - even if you're not a major (babar) Who fan.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game has it all. Great graphics, music  and mix of puzzles and HO's.  Played the free version and had to buy the rest of the game.  Well, worth it.  I paid 4.99 just noticed now it's .99.  Get it at this great price.  Used on my Kindle Fire HD, worked great.
B0088W6LGY|5.0|Atlantis isn't the most thought provoking, but it is a whole lot of fun. I'm rewatching it from it's original run years ago and it's definitely as good as I remembered.
B007R41E8O|1.0|This app took so long to download it was ridiculous.  I tried it on my Kindle Fire HD.  Never played it.  It was downloading for most of the afternoon and still did not finish.  Glad I only paid .99 and that was too much.
B00CE03UOC|4.0|If you love mazes....you'll like this game. Connecting the like colored dots without crossing any other line. Great game. Love it.
B002CPD5LM|5.0|Superb recording. The quality of the DVD is superb. Visual effects are captivating and the rhythm in the music is smooth and vocals are melodious and presented with pristine clarity.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This book reads like your are having a conversation with the characters. Engrossing from scene to scene and all the characters are connected just like real life. Just beautiful and totally genuine.
B000FC2KL0|5.0|Amazing. So well written. As someone in recovery myself, I get it.  Read it in a few days and told all my sober friends to.do the same.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|I enjoy the continous story and the weaving of the characters, even if it is somewhat impossible, but then the whole story is impossible.
B003UESJ9M|4.0|Another tragic story of people not able to handle fame and abundant success--a bitter sweet story.  The music is great!  I was surprised to learn that Gwyneth Paltrow actually did her own singing of her character's songs in the movie.  She did a great job, and I was impressed.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is my favorite game ever it is so fun i really recamend this game if u love hores this is ur game also u get to train and go into shows and if u win u can get a free horse after u win enough
B00DP3IGJ6|5.0|This movie was very well written loved every second of it. Had a lot of surprises I was not expecting. Tom does it again great acting from Morgan freeman and entire cast.
B00DU74U74|1.0|Based upon my husband, he did not enjoy the film, he said it was boring and he<br />during it he went to sleep.
B002BWQ6H6|5.0|Reading this novel by Colum McCann required some patience. The author gives us several seemingly unrelated chapters which require our imagination to make the needed connections. I enjoy the challenge which McCann presents. The reader needs to have faith in the author that the stories will all mesh and make sense. They do and all the intellectual challenge is worth the effort for the reader. The novel is unique and very special.
B005K17RU0|3.0|It's okay,  I guess I should have paid for the upgraded version to eliminate the bothersome flashing ads that jump around at the bottom of the screen.
0316010669|5.0|Blink is the second writing from Gladwell to explore what many call fringe psychology and make it understandable to the masses.  As usual, when one takes an already not wildly accepted idea and forces it into what could be everyday action, many don't accept or appreciate the effort.  I on the other hand enjoy these concepts very much.<br /><br />The concept in Blink is that we all have within us the capability of what he calls rapid cognition or thin slicing.  The idea is that within any personal interaction, when we perform tasks within our areas of expertise, and in may other day to day activities, we perform thousands of rapid cognitions in which our intuition, knowledge, and rationality make very quick decisions.  These decisions, either consciously or unconsciously, guide our more conscious actions and decisions throughout the remainder of the interaction.<br /><br />Like with all of the Gladwell books, he brings to light many of the experts in this field, Paul Ekman and Gavin de Becker are two of the more published of the crowd, and Gladwell summarizes their expertise and experience and applies it to his own examples of situations in which he believes thin slicing has aided individuals or enhanced their abilities to perform their specific tasks.<br /><br />As I said in my review of The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference, these books are not for everyone.  Some people do not enjoy having things that they hold true in their lives questioned.  Some people do not enjoy questioning what they think they know and if this is the case, then do not read anything Gladwell writes.  But if you are someone who enjoys differing viewpoints and exciting concepts of our abilities as humans then I would say read and enjoy.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I have loved this app, but the changes made this month are no good.<br />Please go back to your old background. The new changes are harder to read.
B00AC8ZJPQ|2.0|Plot thin, OH I hurt, I'm in pain, I will not follow orders, oh me oh my, (and I'm in a Military school?)!  No Basic Training Military skill sets! or an 05 bang bang like maneuvers.  Officer candidate school, Free Time!??  How to secure a Hummer, take care of casualties, evac, attack, retreat, rallie point, secure a parameter? Killed the rented movie with 30 minutes left.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game Is a fun &quot;Despicable me&quot; twist. It reminded me of &quot;Subway Surfers&quot; meets &quot;Temple Run&quot;. This game Is totally recommended for despicable me, temple run, Subway surfer, all aged loving croud
B00CH26TL8|4.0|I think you could slow the game a little bit slower then that ,I  really  had fun with  it.<br /><br />Contessa ,<br />Anna Maria
B00BWQTZBG|3.0|Beware - this DVD is cropped.<br /><br />This film was shot in the 1.85:1 theatrical aspect ratio, but is unfortunately presented here on DVD in a cropped 1.33:1 aspect ratio, losing picture information from both sides.<br /><br />If you want to see the movie in its entirety, your only hope is that HBO gets around to rerunning it on one of their HD channels.
B00BRBIA6C|5.0|fantastic album.  actually the first CD i've bought in a VERY long time.  totally worth it.  glad that Agnetha is singing again.  (Dance your pain away definitely has a disco vibe to it)
B007RQ6WCA|1.0|Bought a new Kindle 7inch Fire HD. Downloaded Dropbox App. When I click (touch the screen) on the App, thre icon turns slightly darker, and nothing happens.  Not much use as far as I can tell.<br /><br />Dropbox on a computer, iPad, or iPhone works great.
B00632HWOG|3.0|It is a versatile program, perhaps to a fault, because it shows two running programs in your Android application manager and quickly depletes the battery on your Android device...I replaced it with a lighter email program.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I loved the story wholeheartedly. It's full of hope. It's about love of so many things that we deal with in reality from such a unique perspective. There are heart breaking moments, there are small miracles, and there are silver linings! I also loved the interesting and realistic characters and how the love of football completely surprises you and how football becomes its own character.
B004SIIBGU|3.0|Smooth, versatile app, which unfortunately can only be used to view your eBay account, and not to buy anything at all, due to fact that the accompanying and essential PayPal app will not download, and gives an error message requiring an immediate forced close.<br />I have tried many times to download the PayPal app and it always fails.<br />It seems nobody has noticed this problem.<br />Disappointed!
B00AFEXRME|2.0|Was looking forward to seeing this movie as Densel Washington was in it.  The first 10 minutes were thrilling to say the least but after that you need gallons of coffee, plenty of Red Bull and 5 Hour Energy drinks to stay with it.  I couldn't!
B000SEGMAU|5.0|This book was a required read from my gerontology Prof. I absolutely loved it. Should be a required read for all.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|Beware  with children.  Has many add options that are easily selected by small innocent hands and will charge to your account.  Its obvious that was the intention when developing.  Graphics are great an fun to play otherwise. Would rate 5 stars if it wasn't a ploy to get adds accedently selected ...
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Thins game is very fun, but there is an update on all Apple devises but not the kindle. When will the update for el-macho's lair come, all my friends have it on the Apple devises but it is still a very fun game
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Best book I've read this year.  It totally pulled me in and held me in its world.  I wish it had been longer.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This is the best game ever! Everybody get it! Girls ans boys love it!  This is my favorite game! Everybody will love it any age!
B001AQQR2S|5.0|What a fun story -- The acting is great!!  Very entertaining.  Fairy tale style captures the imagination.  Scary and funny
B000003TAB|3.0|With so few Nirvana albums actually ever recorded, it's hard for any true fan not to own this album.  Nevermind and In Utero are just so great and groundbreaking that it's very seldom that I ever listen to Incesticide when I'm in the Nirvana mood.  Bleach definitely had its moments and it was a decent debut so even it pulls rank over Incesticide any day.  I'm sure the main reason for its existence in the first place was to capitalize on the popularity of Nevermind.  My point is...Do I own it? Yes.  Do I ever listen to it? Not really.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Its so funny,  I play against my brothers and friends all the time . I love the characters but all I wish is for more levels
B00CMYRSQG|4.0|Although they haven't done much to change up their sound, August Burns Red continually puts out good albums.  That is, if you like their style.  Their debut is my favorite and Leveler is probably my least favorite, but I can pop any of them in anytime and never feel like skipping a song.  Some bands change their whole sound every album.  It works for few and is disastrous for many.  I can't say that I like all bands that stay the course throughout every album either.  I just feel it works for ABR.  They probably aren't at the very top of many people's list but at least when you buy one of their albums you know that you will either like it or hate it, before you even hear a song.  That formula has worked for AC/DC, Slayer, Testament, and many other great bands for years.
B004FS1TLM|5.0|Michael Buble hits all the right notes here (pun unintentional). He blends a mix of standards and more modern songs using his wonderful voice.<br /><br />A must have that I now have.
B00C70FG2S|4.0|I think DT peaked with Fiction.  Damage Done and Character are my favorites.  Construct doesn't contain anything new, which isn't always bad, but it also doesn't hold up to the standard that DT had been maintaining.  I do prefer it over We Are the Void though, so maybe they'll make their way back.  Overall, it's still a decent addition to my DT collection.
B0025WX2YW|5.0|I watched all seasons, it was an amazing mini series that I really enjoyed.  I loved all the actors, and actresses.
B00BUT5I84|3.0|It's not that this is a horrible album but I can't say that it's as solid or innovative as their first 2 albums.  Even This Is War has started to grow on me but this album feels either rushed or like an attempt at an artistic record that I just don't understand.  I was blown away the first time I heard their debut album and A Beautiful Lie has, over time, became my favorite. Each album has been a step up as far as production and mixing quality.  I just don't think that more production has paid off for 30STM.  It has taken away some of the edge that helped put them on the map and made them different than slightly similar bands.
B005ZUR724|5.0|Fun and entertaining, I've been playing for over a year now. But I feel customer support is a bit cold and detached and the updates often don't work right when they are first applied to the game. But if your patient within a few days to a week the bugs in the updates are fixed.
B00AH69BPM|4.0|Death Magnetic is by far my favorite Metallica album since before the Black Album and these songs contain the same aggression and overall feel.  I guess that's kind of obvious since they were originally written and recorded for DM, but were cut from the final release.  At this point, all I want to know is if they're going to return to this style for the next record or fade back into mediocrity. I'm sure Lulu was an interesting project for them to work on but I can't see them going that way again for a long time.  Metallica never fails to change things up a bit but they always seem to release either instant classics or full blown duds.  Either way, this is a great addition to your Metallica collection and a must-have for any hardcore fans.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I am enjoying this series immensely, and am reading all the books for the second time.  So much detail, and I am absorbing more the second ti<br />me around.  Like they always say, the book(s) are far better than a film.
B00CXQL828|5.0|My initial interest in The Winery Dogs was due to Mike Portnoy's involvement. Ever since I first heard him on Neal Morse's post-Spock's Beard solo albums, he's become one of my favorite drummers, and I've been slowly trying to acquire his complete discography (an incredibly daunting task). I was well aware of Billy Sheehan's reputation as a bass player, as well, but Richie Kotzen was a complete blank slate to me. I'd heard his name, but was unfamiliar with his work. Imagine my surprise when, upon my first listen (the band's \\"Elevate\\" single on YouTube), it wasn't Portnoy that blew me away, but Kotzen.<br /><br />This is not to take anything away from Portnoy or Sheehan. Portnoy's a monster on the drums, and I don't think I've ever heard a bad performance from him. Whether it's the prog of Neal Morse or Transatlantic, the prog-metal of Dream Theater, the hard rock of Adrenaline Mob, or the pop/rock of Flying Colors, he slides effortlessly from genre to genre and always seems to know exactly what to bring to each song. This album is no exception.<br /><br />Sheehan, as I've learned, is a \\"lead bass player.\\" To be honest, I had no idea what that meant until I listened to the single I mentioned previously. I'm not that familiar with Mr. Big, but I'd always imagined them as being more of a pop/rock band. Continuing in the same vein as the single, Sheehan is a madman on the bass, sometimes mimicking the melodies from Kotzen's guitar, sometimes being in lockstep with Portnoy's drumming, and sometimes just doing his own bizarre thing. He never lets up. This might sound like it would be distracting, but it's not. Like Portnoy, he doesn't do anything that detracts from the song itself. Needless to say, based on his performance here, I may need to check out Mr. Big's discography and see what I've been missing.<br /><br />As for Kotzen, I had no idea what to expect. All mentions of him I'd come across in various articles or reviews referred to his guitar playing, but there he was in the \\"Elevate\\" video performing lead vocals as well, sounding a little like Chris Cornell at times but sounding mostly like a guy with a great voice that is completely comfortable with his talents on vocals and guitar and doesn't feel like he's got anything to prove. Considering his bandmates here, that's pretty amazing. It's not cockiness but assuredness, and it brings a certain level of laid-back calm to the surface of these songs that have so much going on instrumentally. It sounds like these guys were born to make music together.<br /><br />After obtaining a pre-release copy for purposes of this review, I'm pleased to say that the pre-order I placed here on Amazon after hearing \\"Elevate\\" stands. I'm giving these guys my money. This entire album is full of glorious goodness. There are a few ballads, some mid-tempo stuff, and several flat-out rockers. And they're all brilliant. Although the songs sometimes sounds like a combination of '70s hard rock and '90s grunge, the overall sound is both modern and timeless.<br /><br />In short, this is fantastic rock and roll. There's nothing trendy, hipsterish, or pretentious on here, just three insanely talented guys that love rock music. A lot of bands make the claim of getting back to the basics, but few of them do it as well as The Winery Dogs.<br /><br />I originally posted this review on spacecityrock.com.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I'm not one who normally rates things, nor am I normally keen on puzzle games, but this blew my mind.  Cheers to the developers whose hard work truly paid off.  Playing this game was a full immersion experience, and it has struck the right balance of suspense, challenge, and a story line narrative that leaves me yearning for more.  I have paid a lot of money for games that are a fraction as entertaining.  This will be $2 well spent! Highly, highly, HIGHLY recommend!  I totally wish I was part of a team that could produce a high quality, low cost masterpiece such as this.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|really enjoying the game play as well as the interaction with the Despicable Me characters and story line. I would highly recommend this title for Android.
B0090SI582|3.0|This movie was a let down as the hype was saying it would be better than Origins. However, that was not the case. The movie pick ups about two years after X3 and has Logan dealing with the emotional repercussions of what took place in that film. A somewhat quasi-sequel. Other than the memory loss issue prevalent in the original trilogy and explained in Origins, there is no reference to anything about those movies except for the guilt he's dealing with from X3. The rest is totally brought up out of nowhere, cinematically speaking, except flashbacks shown to the audience that Logan doesn't remember until about halfway through the film. The story and action is dragging for most of the film and we don't get the wolverine until three quarters of it is over. There's a romance thrown in there that seems too quick to be believably developed and only purpose being to probably set up Wolverine 3 or 4. They should've just picked up where Origins left off and focused on the brother dynamic between wolverine and sabretooth, but the director said he didn't even want to mention Origins and keep this a stand alone film. Which is interesting as the film definitely had a different style to it than any of the previous films, but the best  part of it, in my opinion, was the post credits scene reminiscent of the original Xmen movie. Anyway, I'll break down this movie in the ranks of how I like the xmen saga: X2 is a five star film, X1 and Origins get four stars, while X3 and this movie get three, as I feel generous today. Hopefully, Bryan Singer will fix the issues this movie creates by the time Xmen: Days of Future Past comes out.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I love the relationship of Harvey and Mike...After a long day on my computer, it's fun to switch over to Amazon Prime / Suits!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|...but I am not very happy that the game states that I must review to keep the app after level 10.
B0040HO01Y|4.0|This was free with Amazon Prime so I thought I'd give it a try. I really enjoyed it, there is a great cast of characters and the story is interesting.
B006I1OB0U|5.0|Downton continues to enchant and enthrall and pull you in, starving for more with its Christmas episode.  Something about this series, once it hooks you, really keeps you addicted and wanting more.  You can't get enough soon enough!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's fun for kids of all ages.  Loved the game play for kindle fire. Get this game today! You will be amazed like I am.
B009UVWBMA|5.0|It's hard to believe that Taylor Swift is so young when you listen to both her lyrics and the diversity of her voice.  'Red,Deluxe' is stellar with its original songs and new additions.  The range of styles is terrific and it seems that so many of these tunes could be #1 hits.  I think that this is one of the best albums I've seen her or any artist put out in a long time.  She's about the only young artist who can still count as a role model among all of the other disappointing and bad examples young people have out there - and she appeals to an older listening audience as well.
0399255370|2.0|I hate children's books that reinforce stereotypes, such as the part about the pink crayon \\"pink is a girl's color\\". I found this book unimaginative and predictable.
B00A2DOKLU|5.0|The New MJ of a post MJ era. Music is still in a good stasis with The Weeknd as a successor to R&B.
B00C7TAF3Y|1.0|After spending much time trying to figure out why I kept getting an error message when we tried to purchase the game, I called Amazon.<br /><br />They confirmed that this game works on all of the second generation Kindle Fires, but not the 1st generation...<br /><br />They should at least document that fact better. And they should also have given a specific error message when I tried to download it, rather than a generic \\"An error has occurred...)
B004SMDJ9U|4.0|It is a interesting mix of supernatural and crime solving series as well  as the acting also is very good
B0013ND30M|5.0|The DVD version was perfect and nicely priced.  My daughter loved the movie and has now moved on to something else.
B00ADGSIRS|4.0|For a old school synth fan, what's not to like about &#34;Off The Record&#34;?  Nothing - Karl knows how to deliver the sound we have long craved from the enigmatic pioneers of electronica.  Sonically, the disc sounds amazing and the songs are very good. My favorites are Atonium, Without A Trace of Emotion, and Rhythmus.  The included book is very informative - you can read up on Karl's experience which influenced his work.<br /><br />I really hope that this record gets at least a cult following - I want to hear more like this!
0425263924|5.0|l really liked this book.  I loved the whole series.  Several of my friends have borrowed it and we all say the same thing.  We want more.  I can't wait for the next one.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a good book it is kind of sad at parts but besides that it is good if you saw the movie you will love the book
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|One  of the best running games ive played, and actually has kept me comming back to play (probably the minions that do it for me B I G  Fan)
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is one  of those books that you can't just put down! Looking forward to the third book in this trilogy!!
B0042TV4IW|4.0|If you loved Christy, Anne from Green Gables, and Downton Abby you also love this series. Great for families and folks who love period pieces.
B008Y73XTQ|4.0|Explains total waste of wars started by  old men and  finished by young men dying. Should be shown on tv every year.
B000683VI4|5.0|I have seen this movie on pay per view many times and taped on vhs but I rather dvds so that's why I bought it
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|A very good movie with great acting and some humor thrown in.  I could watch this movie again and will definitely recommend it to my friends.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|There is a richness of character and plot that is enchanting.  A wonderful read that is hard to put down.
1469203812|4.0|Love the story, the cd version is as good as the written page.  I had one cd that had a flaw that I could not remedy, but the rest of them were just dandy.
B00621E94E|5.0|Lost still is the best sci-fi television series ever on television! It doesn't just keeping you engaged, to transforms you in the audience!
B009FZFONO|5.0|Exciting show! Action packed. Addictive. Filled with drama and plenty of action. Must see TV.<br />Unpredictable and very well written.
B005RAO0GS|5.0|This woman is so amazing. I love this album and the voice behind the music. She has such a unique and powerful voice. Love it!
B00BQ1D7X4|2.0|Well before I get to this bashing AiC is one of my favorite bands in a large group of musical artists that entertain and inspire me. Unplugged is one of the greatest albums ever made.<br /><br />But I can't stand whoever and the hell masters these releases for some of the remaining 'grunge' bands. Pearl Jam has gotten the crap stick lately even more so than they did originally. The Nevermind remaster as well was brickwalled to hell. This one is even worse! Good lord. It didn't used to be like this. WHY? GOD WHY! I have a nice stereo system! You don't need to master an album that is so brickwalled it starts cutting my ears at high volume. A DR5 recording lol.<br /><br />About as much as you could ever push an album without it sounding absolutely unlistenable, like Death Magnetic, on a decent stereo. This means the waveform is basically one large brick no matter what anyone in the band is doing. All sound is uniform and ****ing LOUD. Like a poorly mastered concert live or on disc you can't really tune your volume or stereo to get a good definition of the sound. Nor can you hear ANY subtle dynamics with the musicians themselves.<br /><br />The music here is about on par with the last album if you care at this point. I would say not as good. The first post-Layne album I actually quite liked, and it did have some great tunes by Cantrell, but I had to get through the obnoxious compression to like it. I am fine with some crushing dynamics when appropriate but this just isn't even fun anymore to see albums by bands like this so carelessly mastered. They also seem to be treading some water here. I don't quite hear some of the passion I heard from Cantrell on the first one. And I don't even really care they have a new singer because well it really isn't AiC to be honest but that doesn't bother me.<br /><br />Layne will never be replaced and we all know that. Thanks for trying guys if I could have my hearing back I might be able to accurately review the album at full volume!<br /><br />TORRENT. They have enough money as is.r /><br />TORRENT. They have enough money as is.
B007U8U1V8|5.0|This album is very well done. Jack White is an amazingly talented artist. I love his work! Would recommend this to everyone.
074401493X|4.0|This guide is great, it's a real quality book that goes perfectly with my collector's edition. I would recommend it for those who are looking for more information on multiplayer or who need the extra help for story, but that being said, the story is so well written that this guide is almost a spoiler to it but it's still great for collectors.
B008FTAAG2|5.0|This band is so amazing! I absolutely love her voice! Amazingly talented! I listen to this to put me in a good mood! Love it!
B00BQHA0UQ|5.0|I hated waiting 8 years but it was well worth it. I have no idea what he's saying because I do not speak Spanish but Carlos's music speaks to me. The quality of the music, vision and creativeness is just mind blowing. Too many artist churn crap out because of the business, but he is a true artist whose music I look forward to discovering.<br />I just saw him in concert in NJ and I've never been to a concert where everyone had sober fun and danced from the moment the opening act came out till Carlos ended. I was just happy to get tickets, psyched to make it to an awesome concert, and over the moon to quite randomly meet him in person. He's as normal and real as apple pie, and goes on my very short list of artists I will see again, and travel to go see.<br /><br />Can't recommend this album enough, though Dejame Entrar is still one of my all time favorites.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Great acting.  Raw like The Wire.  Shows an art of interrogating unseen in many other films/shows.  It's a real look at corruption in a brutal task force for the LAPD that does a lot of good and a lot of bad.  Everyone has heard about Chiklis but Walton Goggins also thrives as Shane, Vic Mackey's closest friend.  Any fans of The Wire should watch this.  I'm really into great drama series and this is a top 10 show easily, perhaps top 5 because the final season is awesome and the performances across the board are pretty great.
B00338QENI|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I learned a great deal about tissue culture, patient privacy, and class in America. I gained a new appreciation for the forms I sign when I visit a medical or dental office. But in addition to new facts, I was treated to a layered story. One of the many intriguing plot threads for me was the mother-daughter relationship between Henrietta and her daughter Debra (sp? not sure because I listened to the audio version). Even though Henrietta died when Debra was too young to remember her consciously, Debra needed to find out and understand what happened to her mother. This quest was central for me; I wanted Debra to find some peace. The mother-daughter dynamic is complicated, and this story is one example of how it cannot be ignored. A great read on many levels; highly recommended.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Didn´t know about Nikola Tesla, it was nice to get to know about this great man and all his inventions.<br /><br />People need to know about Tesla, I recomend this book.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|i could never get it to load i tried three times what a waste of time it should say what versions wont work with it
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Best horse game ever! BUT every item is exspensive and you can't really progress without using real $$$$ I'm making slow progress but I refuse to pay.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun,challenging, and addicting, would recommend anyone, any age to play this game and to compete against each other, great game!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|One of the best books I've read in years!  I read it in a day and a half and practically put my life on hold.  Soulful, well written and though provoking.  You will never see your dog the same way again.  Nor will you view your life in the same manner.  Highly recommend this book!
B00785P2QC|4.0|So far I like this game. Great graphics for an app. I like the different goals. Only some goals you have to wait forever to get to do.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Every one will love it. You will not regret buying it!!! I read it in 5 days because it was sooooo good!!!
B002RI9UBS|2.0|I heard all the hype and saw the movie, which I enjoyed although it certainly wasn't one i felt the need<br />to make part of my collection. I just found the book very hard to follow and just gave up couldn't  get into it sorry,<br />I may revisit it at another time.
B005USZYDU|5.0|I am a true fan of John Grisham.  He is such a fantastic Author.  What I like about this book is that the ending left me hanging.  In fact there was no ending.  I came up with my own ending which is unusual for an Author to do.  Brilliant.  Absolutely Brilliant.  2 thumbs up.
B00407PNY2|5.0|I am Dan Rodgers, author of Call Me Sergeant Rock. I have watched this DVD 3 times with my family and of course the grand kids. The car chase scenes seem to never get old. McQueen was a great actor. Another great DVD to watch if your a car buff is Vanishing Point. The one where he crashes into the bulldozers.
B004ZZS4CC|3.0|Having heard about this story in the news, I was interested in reading Jaycee's story. It's very upsetting to know that this kind of tragic thing happens so often in America. The book evoked feelings in me that made it impossible to enjoy reading it, but it was informative. I am so happy that Jaycee survived to tell her story and wish her well in her continuing recovery.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I am an appleTV user, I though this might complement my setup essentially for youtube clips. Installation was ok but clunky and counterintuitive, I had to install using my MacBook Pro since it wouldn't install with my MacPro (computer has to be within 20 feet of TV) also it wouldn't connect to the 5 GHz band of my router, only the 2.4, oh well. So after few tries it is setup to my Samsung TV and it worked lunching youtube clips through my iPod 4. Discovered that it offers almost same functionality already available through my samsung BluRay player, oh well. Did not try the Netflix because I had the service suspended and Google special offer evaporated. For now I can only test youtube since it is the only service available. I would say it is ok to launch a clip but beyond that, it is clunky. Hard to control the playback, navigation, turn on/off etc really useless. It would be nice to have its own app available (a la appleTV remote), as opposed to control thru the youtube app which if you exit you need to start over again. There are no other services available for now so it is really limited. Will wait to see how this evolves overtime. At $35 I don't feel horrible about wasting money, although it is a waste since it offers nothing new or more convenient than what I already have. AppleTV with airplay is far more superior. The youtube app on appleTv is much better and more convenient. I doubt if the Chromecast will change that landscape anytime soon.
1609611543|5.0|Dr.Davis kept me on the edge of my seat wanting to know more and more. His knowledge has changed two lives for the better!
B007THA4FI|5.0|Wonderful pace of story telling. Near the end I couldn't turn the page fast enough to see where this story was going!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I finished this book in one day. Funny, charming, and tragic. Loved every minute of it. It was a fantastic read!
B002MQYOFW|1.0|Not as gory as you might think. Great story line, certainly haven't read anything like it. Couldn't put it down.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|I'm the first to admit how clueless I am about NK.  And to learn this is &#34;life&#34; for them day to day.  We cannot imagine the indignities they deal with on a daily basis.  But this book educated me, and appreciate that.  I would recommend the book to our youth - to learn note to take your freedoms for granted....
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|What a wonderful story line.  Just how I dreamed the high society liffe was like in England, and probably America in the 1920's
B008FRFN7A|5.0|I have a 6 mos old Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and bought a new HP printer this week, a series 3520 model all-in-one.  I downloaded and installed the program without any hangups.  The program automatically linked to my printer, I did nothing.  Picked something to print and it printed off just fine.  My experience was very good, am not sure why others experience problems.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Normally I'm not huge into these types of puzzle games but this one is just amazing. It's fun, tricky, but not impossible. Truly worthy of a five star rating. All I have to say is keep it up. I loved and so did my girlfriend and we never agree on games. Totally worth the money!
B00C5W3SBE|4.0|saw this in IMAX 3D and it was great but I think I will love it in my living room just as much plus I got a 3D copy to watch at my son's on his 3D TV
B0076DCT2G|2.0|John and Kate are sent to Yemen.  This statement covers 98% of the book and is just as entertaining.  John Corey's comments have gone from witty to just irritating and as someone else noted added nothing to the book. I've read most of Nelson DeMille's books and have enjoyed them, but if this was the first one I ever read, I don't think I would read any others.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is game is fun and very realistic. I'm loving the stable hand.  Lol.  If u love horses this is the game for u.
B00CRWJ7VC|1.0|I am all for movies that make you think, but when the actors change character names at least 4 times in the movie, it becomes too much.
B0074VTHKM|5.0|This is John Grisham inserting a bit of humor in his story.  It is about a kid who appears more intelligent than his peers in the legal world.  A whole different tune for Mr. Grisham.  If you are a fan of old, then you might be disappointed; I, on the other hand am not and found it to be a: &#34;breath of fresh air&#34; in an otherwise muddled environment.
B001CDZZI6|3.0|what do you do with this information after you read it,  work on me and hate you don't know,  i have kept it in my desk as a reference
B0083ZBW2Y|4.0|I liked this book because it was interesting but what I didn't like was it was sad at some points
B008QMMEOE|4.0|My 18-month-old son loves things that go, so this puzzle appealed to him right away. He doesn't have the dexterity to get the pieces in the right spots, but he loves watching me to do it. It keeps him sitting and occupied for about 30 minutes at a time. He loves popping the balloons and bubbles that come after you complete a puzzle as well.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|You can find this review at My Favorite Things(heffroberts.blogspot.com)<br /><br />Reflected in You by Sylvia Day is hot, intense, and the continuing source of one the best book boyfriends EVER!!! Gideon Cross is alpha male to the highest power and he is a kind, loyal lover who understands Eva better than she understands herself. If you haven't read this series yet, you should. If you are taking the time to read this review, trying to decide, stop right now, read the book!<br /><br />Audible Audiobook \\"Review: Crossfire # 2: Reflected In You\\"<br />If you could sum up Reflected in You in three words, what would they be?<br />He did what?!?<br /><br />What did you like best about this story?<br />In the first book we met Gideon and he was distant, cold, economical. By the end of book one, we sort of know better, but only barely. In this book we finally get to see who he is, inside, because of Eva. He is no longer a cold calculating billionaire, he is molten lava hot for Eva and will do anything, I repeat, ANYTHING, for her. I liked the angsty feelings that dredged up whilst reading this. It had been a while since I read book one and two and I am re-reading these before I begin book three. I forgot just how awesome Gideon is.<br /><br />What does Jill Redfield bring to the story that you wouldn't experience if you just read the book?<br />Her smooth voice and slight character changes can almost make the words play out like a movie in your head.<br /><br />Did you have an extreme reaction to this book? Did it make you laugh or cry?<br />It's a re-read for me so I pretty much knew what was coming. However, the fact that Brett happens to be in love with Eva when she was thinking this whole time she was just one of the many girls he was having was bittersweet.<br />***SPOILER BELOW***<br />When Gideon sees them kissing he charges and attacks Brett,and even though she didn't start the kiss and had just pulled away realizing it's ONLY Gideon she wants, you have to wonder what this now means for Eva and Gideon...<br />\\"I'd caused that. I had turned the warm, wickedly playful man who'd enchanted me all evening into the cold murderous fighter in front of me.\\"<br /><br />And then the ride in the limo after they pick Gideon back up...Holy Hotness...*fanning face*...WOW! He asks her over and over \\"Why, Eva?\\" and she tells him \\"I don't know\\" and a sexual battle ensues and she finally breaks down. That was intense!<br /><br />Any additional comments?<br />Read this series!!! It's awesome!at this now means for Eva and Gideon...<br />\\"I'd caused that. I had turned the warm, wickedly playful man who'd enchanted me all evening into the cold murderous fighter in front of me.\\"<br /><br />And then the ride in the limo after they pick Gideon back up...Holy Hotness...*fanning face*...WOW!

B00701L5XS|5.0|This is one of those apps that everyone should have just so you can refer to it as needed.  Even if you know some of them, it's a great visual reference tool.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|You should separate the reviews before and after update and watch the rating plummet!  Bring back the old version or I'll be removing this app!.....Don't you market test???
B003L77GH4|5.0|Came quickly, was as described, works really well! :) I highly recommend this trader. Really happy with trade, would trade again in an instant.
B004QX07G4|4.0|Thoughly enjoyed Ellen's book and of course the ease of buying and reading online. She has a wonderful sense of humor!
B0053JJLLC|3.0|ok but not great. kind of jumpy and ends too quickly after the climax of the story. attempted twists that don't really work.
B00A17AD36|5.0|I do like this. The thing I like most is that I can listen to it from different devices. But it is a nice romantic sound to just sit back with your boo and listen too.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Ender's Game is a brilliant novel and gives a strong insight into some of the things that define humanity. Was enjoyable throughout the entire book. Definitely something that anyone of all ages would enjoy.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|Great game all together except for that on my Kindle Fire when I reach the second part of the Vector battle (where you throw the robot at him), it will not let me throw it at all. I tried everything I could. Not fun getting stuck and having to quite every time.
B00DIFARQ6|2.0|I got this because it was the daily free app from amazon. I played a few levels and it was pretty fun. When I tried to get past the tutorial map it wanted me to purchase additional maps to continue to play. Isn't listed as a pay to play app and I never would have downloaded it and wasted my time if I knew I'd have to pay for a free app to play it.
B0085OEU1I|5.0|This film is a classic must see! A wonderful rendition of the timeless play. why are six more words required??
159562015X|4.0|The book itself is broken down into two sections. The front takes you through the preparation of what the book is about, then follows the instruction on how to take the test. The key to excess the test is in the back of the book, It is good for one person. The second part of the book has all the explanations of the different types of gifts and personality. I found it very interesting.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Great show. I really like the characters. It's not just a court room drama. Alicia's family life and the firm are just as important narratives.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Really comes in handy on the go in Oklahoma especially during tornado season keeps me up to date minute by minute.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Very well written.  I couldn't put it down and I want to read it again.  It was very inspiring and I'm so glad I read it.
B00CQGU9GG|5.0|All the albums I wanted to own from ZZ Top and thought I never would. Amazon.com - never a complaint, always true to your word.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Very well acted, story moves along very well, keeps the viewer interested in all the characters.  Dialogue is a key part to the enjoyment
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|The minions are hysterical and the animation is great.  Very touching story.  The girls are so cute.<br />Can't wait to see the sequel!!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Jojo Moyes has completely won me over. As we all know, one of the main themes in this book is a very controversial and ethical dilemma occurring worldwide... And Moyes handles it beautifully.<br /><br />Me Before You includes a great number of complex and deep characters, namely Louisa, a 27 year old woman who has lived a life without ambitions, passions, and dreams towards the future. She is content with her simple life, but a newfound unemployment status leads her to temporarily care for an quadriplegic man, Will. Before the accident, Will had everything - a big business, a beautiful girlfriend, enough cash to last a lifetime. One moment changes his life forever.<br /><br />Will has plans for his future set out in stone... And Louisa makes it her goal to change that. And within these six months... Everything changes. Will is no longer the closed off man that he once was. Louisa is no longer one to shy away from new experiences. And in the eyes of each, it is due to the other.<br /><br />In the span of six months, Louisa and Will go through realizations and experiences that neither would have gone through without the other. Their lives changes completely... And yet, in some aspects, they don't change at all.<br /><br />Me Before You presents to readers an unconventional type of love. A love that one cannot help but to root for.  An unconditional love that surpasses absolutely all boundaries. Louisa and Will prove the importance of selfless love and Moyes handles the story in both an admiral and painful way.<br /><br />Louisa and Will have taught me more about love in less than 450 pages than any other book I have ever read. No book has ever emotionally drained me as this one has. No book has resulted me into sobs as this one has. It is one of those stories... The ones that stay with you forever.
B00DHSK3RM|2.0|This is just a pretty wrapper for youtube videos and advertisements. No actual \\"Help\\" is provided. Even the organization of the videos is bad. Not even worth the free price.
B009NG1Q96|3.0|The Elite continues off right where The Selection began, in which America has made the decision to stay in the competition towards becoming the Princess of Illea, and the bride of the one-day-will-be-King, Maxon. America and Maxon's relationship was rooted in friendship in the first book, and for the first few chapters, it is all rainbows and butterflies for the two.<br /><br />But things hit a rough patch when a situation close to America's heart results in unbelievable and unethical consequences. And when she puts the blame on Maxon, it seemingly all starts to fall apart. Maxon seems to have secrets of his own. The competition is not as final as Maxon has made it seem... while he has chosen with his heart, he must also consider other important factors: the public, the King, America's indecisiveness... When the rebels are closer than they all were lead to believe, America sees that there are better, infinitely more suited options left in The Elite for Maxon. And out of anger, she makes a decision that she can't help but regret... Not only for her sake, but for Maxon's as well. And perhaps, all of the kingdom.<br /><br />The Elite is not how I expected America's story would unravel. I felt that her character regressed greatly from the strong, loud-spoken girl that she was in The Selection. There were times when I felt that it was impossible for this to be the same girl. It was similar with Maxon, whom I absolutely loved in the first book. While Maxon was proclaiming the solidity of their future and his love for her in the start of the book, his actions that follow speak anything but. I missed the friendship between Maxon and America that lead me to love them in the first book. Aspen came off as annoying and irresponsible, and I could not fathom that this boy loved America as much as he said he did if he was willing to risk her life so often considering the situation.<br /><br />Regardless, I am excited to see how this series will end in The One. Illea needs a lot ofchanges for it to become the kingdom that it has the potential to become, and I think that America and Maxon have a large say in how change will come in regards to the caste system and the poverty. I think that they have a lot of potential to change everything. A lot of questions were left unanswered, and Cass is going to have to bring it up a notch and provide her readers with a mindblowing conclusion.
B00881VLCE|3.0|Puzzles pieces used to move and place easily.  After the update very hard to pick up pieces and move where you want them to go.  Would like prior version back.
B008TRUDAS|4.0|Layken Cohen has had a rough couple of months. She has lost her father from a cardiac arrest and has been relocated from her safe, constant family home in Texas to a downgraded house in Ypsilanti, Michigan. Yup. Bags packed and significant belongings shoved into a rented U-Haul, Layken and the remainder of her family move to Michigan, leaving behind her the friends and stability that she has had for so long.<br /><br />Enter Will Cooper - sensitive, handsome, intelligent, and extremely interested in Layken, right up since he saw her park that U-Haul into the driveway without any guidance or assistance whatsoever. Will introduces Lake to the slam, a poetry contest that he participates in regularly. And happens to be quite good at. It doesn't take long for emotions to grow between the two, and it seems that they are well on their way to falling in love and being happy together - only not.<br /><br />A realization between the two leads to months of avoidance, anger, and the occasional weak moment. Love is not meant to be convenient, and it is clear with these two. When the two can barely look at the other in the eye, let alone hold a conversation, it is poetry that holds their thin line together. Yet, in a lot of ways, it is what is tearing them apart. Just as Lake's world is beginning to piece back together, it finds a way to fall apart again. And just when it seems as though there is no hope left... Words have the power to do incredible things - even piece together two people whose strings have been so incredibly tangled already.<br /><br />I actually don't even know how to start this. I don't know. It has been such a long time since a book pulled at my heart, left me in tears, yet unable to stop myself from smiling like this book. Colleen Hoover knew what she was doing when she wrote this. The poetry aspect was fantastic, and I loved that it was such a creative way for us readers to learn about different characters.<br /><br />To be honest, there were a huge numberof times that I found Lake being a bit insensitive to the people around her. There were times that it seemed like Will was all that mattered, nothing else. And I didn't like that. But she held strong when she was needed, and I loved her for that. But oh, gosh. Will was great. In all the ways that mattered. He was encouraging yet firm, strong yet vulnerable, selfish yet completely selfless. I adored him. I loved every single minor character. They all brought a lesson to share with their strong. And that's really why I loved this book so much. Not so much the romance aspect, although it was wonderful, but the lessons and teachings that it has given me about life and love and loss. And nothing can really be better than that in my eyes.<br /><br />For anyone who's a bit more open-minded than the regular conservative reader, and looking for a book that will actually provide you with some insight on a new perspective and a few life lessons on the way, I would wholeheartedly recommend Slammed. It is definitely up there on my favourites list.
1419705644|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo2RQPWMEXE13FV]]I absolutely love this book, the lore is incredible. The pictures are so bright and so vivid. It has everything that you could ever want to know about Adventure Time, you really won't find another Adventure Time book as informative and fun to read as this.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I read Wonder a few months ago and I've got to say, this is one of those books that will stay with me for the rest of my life. Anybody who has been bullied can find a way to relate to August, especially myself, a girl born with cleft lip and palate. I read this book purely based on the positive reviews that it has received and I had no idea that it would turn me into a blubbering, heaving, ridiculous mess by the middle of the book.<br /><br />Wonder is the story of a boy with a whole mixture of deformities and disorders, and how these things affect not only his life, but the lives around him as well. August's situation is difficult on each person that is affected. It is a story of being different, and embracing your differences. R.J Palacio succeeds in writing a heartwarming, tearjerking book that leaves an imprint on all of those who read it.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to absolutely anybody, because I know that deep down inside, everyone has felt a bit like Auggie has.
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|I enjoy reading novels about Africa, and have read other books by this author.  The history about this continent has been so distorted.  I am able to place myself in this young Nigerian woman's shoes. For me reading the book has been a revelation. I tend to have a romanticized view of African life, but this author is honest and open depicting individuals with admirable virtues as well as flaws.( Pretty universal isn't it?
B00CW665VI|4.0|Drew Evans is living the life that every man dreams of. He is ridiculously handsome, ridiculously charming, and ridiculously rich. He lives by one rule - one night stands or nothing. He doesn't do any more. And for quite a while Drew is happy with the life that he lives. He's happy with the nameless sex and the freedom of the single life and the reputation that he has for himself. Simply put, he's a player. And he's never wanted to change that.<br /><br />Until she walks into that club and into his life. Katherine Brooks. Beautiful, intelligent, sexy, and she's got an unlimited number of heels which happens to be Drew's ultimate turn on. Oh, and happily engaged to a musician who has held her down for more than ten years. Kate is equal to Drew in so many ways... Not only does she happen to work at the very same firm that his father owns, she brings out his competitiveness, his fire, his respect. And unknowingly, he does the same for her. Drew has never been one for romance and relationships and love. And just when things are seemingly all worked out, he makes a mistake. One that could cost him everything that he never knew that he even wanted. Drew Evans has never been a desperate man in love... But then again, this is Kate Brooks. And with Kate Brooks, it's a whole new game. And this is a game that Drew has no intention of losing.<br /><br />I literally have no words to explain how much I enjoyed reading this book. I'm not really one to read books of this genre, so I didn't know what to expect. But I really loved Tangled. It was awesome to see the perspective of a player falling in love. It was such a breath of fresh air and Drew was fantastic. Typical male. I really liked reading this in his point of view and to see how much he changes from the beginning to the end was great. I can't even count how many times I bursted out laughing, his thoughts are hilarious! Kate was great as well. She is seriously everything I respect in a woman: hard-working, self-respecting, yet still willing to take risks. Despite both being competitive and hot-headed, the two are quite a match together. Even the side-stories were great. I loved Mackenzie and Drew's friends. All of the characters were realistic and likeable.<br /><br />For anyone looking for a hilarious, hot, yet sweet and romantic story, definitely check out Tangled. I for one will be looking out for the sequel and any other stories by this wonderful author.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this show. I love the costumes, the setting and of course the Crawley family. If you like period dramas this is the best of the best.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Story was good but predictable. For a short novel it was worth reading. I enjoyed reading it. Will read again.
0307352153|4.0|I bought this for one of my co-workers as a gift for always giving me sound and helpful advice. He told me its an interesting read with wonderful insights to those who are introverts.
B00CATSONE|5.0|I really love this book, I've never read about Tesla but when I started to read this book I couldn't stopped.
B006AX6ONI|5.0|I've been a fan of Mark Cuban for a long time. He busted his ass to get where he is and I really like that he is willing to share his advice on becoming successful in life and business. Like him or hate him, the man knows what he's talking about and there's a reason he is a billionaire and an amazing entrepreneur.
B001JU4S44|2.0|I remember being wooed by this whe it came out, but the movie seemed slow and dare I say it...cheesy.
B002H5JHUA|3.0|My wife and I liked this more than we expected (in particular her, who remembered it being incomprehensible) but it's still full of flaws.  Steampunk Frankenstein pursued by Dracula, Lord of the Werewolves?  The premise is like a shotgun.  But it was enjoyable.
B0026KX5PO|5.0|For some reason, I didn't like this movie when it first came out. I watched it again the other night and Loved It! I have a brand new appreciation for it...I guess I needed to grow up a bit before I appreciated this particular story, for whatever reason...
B0039RY3MM|5.0|I recently delidded my i5 3570k and only had AS5 and prolimatech pk-1.  I put pk-1 on the die and on the IHS with no temperature change and was disappointed at taking the time to delid and not getting anything out of it.  But then I bought CLU and put it on the die and my temperatures dropped 12C.  now i have a lot more headroom for a bigger overclock
1557427968|5.0|Perfect quality, cheap price, quick delivery. Needed for a summer reading book. Glad I purchased off of amazon because it was much more pricy in a bookstore
B0046B1KHG|5.0|I'm yet to actually watch this, but my sisters (around 10-15 years old) have and they love it. They just watched the second one, and liked that one too, but from their reactions after watching it I'd guess that they liked the first one more. Whenever it's mentioned that I haven't seen it yet, they make sure to remind me that not seeing it is &#34;despicable&#34;.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Smart, sexy, funny...best entertainment on tv these days! Writing is smart, actors are great....just a great show! Definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a new show to watch.
B0031RAOW8|5.0|This true story - &#34;A Dog's tale&#34;  can melt even the most hardened heart.  Purchasing the video via Amazon allowed me to buy an inexpensive copy for my daughter so that she too could enjoy this touching account of why a dog is &#34;Man's best friend&#34;.  THank you Amazon.  The video arrived right on time and in perfect working order.
B0007XT87G|5.0|I think that about covers it! :-)<br />Oh I have to say more than I did. So how bout....TOTALLY AWESOME!
B0001YRVN4|5.0|I bought this again online for 75% more than its original price. I had it once before but I unfortunately sold it<br /><br />and replaced it with the Wide Screen Trilogy edition while thinking (correctly) that Wide Screen is better.<br /><br />Since then though I've missed the variety and the golden tint of the Star Wars Trilogy DVD 2004 Full Screen.<br /><br />Wide Screen is the original theatrical version while Full Screen was formatted to hug the square screen tight.<br /><br />Unfortunately in this the left and right of the Wide Screen is cut off so it fills the square Telivision screen &#34;Full&#34;
B001JYEMOQ|5.0|This movie grabbed me early with a great storyline.  I thought Matt Damon and Philip Seymour Hoffman were terrific.  5 stars!
B0055SWM08|5.0|One of my favorites, quell is a great little puzzle game for people of all ages. Highly recommended! With the &cent;99 all the way!
B0064J6P8W|4.0|Def an adult comedy. This movie surprised me. I thought it was going to be cutsie and feel good. It was that with a little raunchy adult comedy. Totally unexpected. I wasn't prepared to laugh out loud and boy did I!!!! Make sure the kids are asleep when viewing.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I absolutely love this game! fun for kids and adults, easy to play and the minions are so cute and funny!
B005544TRQ|5.0|This show will keep you tied in from the start to finish. One that you may want to devote a weekend to.
B0040I09RM|5.0|I find this series compelling. Despite the violence, you can't help but love Samcro.  It's a testament to the fine cast of actors and the outstanding writing.
B005723JSQ|3.0|I really enjoyed this book. It's very well written with likable characters! Perfect beach book. Very funny with great storyline.
B009UAO1ZG|4.0|This book was very interesting.  The most interesting thing I found was that history has a way of repeating itself.<br /><br />What happened during the time of the book repeated itself again during the second Bush era.  If you are not with us you are against us.
B0057LUI0O|5.0|The colors are absolutely beautiful, and the characters are loveable. One day I hope to visit Rio (the country), but for the time being I will have to satisfy my urge by watching &#34;Rio, The Movie&#34;.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is addictive. It makes you think a little but not too much. It is challenging and fun. Hard to put down.
B008VVT51U|5.0|I used to wonder what I would do, if I suddenly had the urge, or need to make a change in my life.  Now I know, that I would like to do, just like the characters in this movie did, move to another country (not really, I love the USA). I would however, like to take an extended visit to a place like India. I loved the movie. I became so caught up in the clothes that Judy Dench's character wore, that I am now looking to extend my own wardrobe, with the pants and kurtas (tunics) that she wore in the movie. She looked so classic. I loved it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game! It is so much fun and you can compete with your friends. Also, the minions are super cute!
B009WO7NQO|4.0|Great challenge.  Really makes you work and plan your moves.  Good for kids as well as adults.  Good purchase for all ages.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|A terrific series I would highly recommend it...very believable; terrific acting.....the kind of series you want to never end<br />all the characters are well thought out

B00AFCEIB0|2.0|I went to install this app on my tablet and my antivirus said that it was a potential threat. Why? I don't know.  But what I do know is that I did not ignore the \\"Ignore\\" button. So I did not download or install this app.

B009LMTDL0|5.0|I liked that Ms. Sandberg took the time to write this. I think so many are blind to the subtle ways that women are kept down, myself included. She awoke in me the knowledge that the biggest offender of women staying small can be our own patterns and deep rooted learned behaviors and not others' discrimination.

B00BBI9WD6|5.0|The republic needs allies, even if those allies are a little... backward (socially and technologically).  One can get along with the ignorant and the misguided, can't one?<br />The answer for Honor Harrington is \\"Yes, absolutely.\\"  Until it pushes too far, when ignorance turns into disrespect and childishness, then it is time to clean house!<br /><br />Once again, David Weber has crafted a wonderful tale of struggle-- this time the struggle to take a small amount of elites and replicate those results with folks who lack a similar background and training, imagine the difficulties were we to try to demonstrate an e-reader to a 1950's era person that we woke from cryo-stasis....  Now imagine that there is a riveting story in that premise, and that there are lives at stake-- Really, I envy you new reader.  This book is a old friend now and I hope you love it too.

B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Love the game. It's really cute. Love the different costumes. The \\"prices\\" for them shouldn't be so out of reach.. Takes too long to load.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|So fun. I love minions there so cute. This game is really fun and keeps your attention. It doesn't get boring.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Love it!  Entertaining and educational!  Makes me want to take a vacation and go running!<br />You don't stop running because you get old, you get old because you stop running... -Dipsea Demon<br />Great read!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This game is very good for hand and eye coordination for kids and for adults too........if you know someone who is a senior it will be good for keeping their mind occupied and build up their eye hand coordination. What comes to mind is AUTISM and DEMENTIA..........
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This show is great, I loved the first two seasons and this one didn't disappoint at all. I love the costumes, the cast and the writing!
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This is a great game to show your imagination. All you have to do is your in a noun and it will pop up on the screen. It will even let you do mythical creatures and even characters from books

B006LSZECO|5.0|I couln't put the book down. It held my interest through the whole book. Can not wait to read her next book.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Good interactive game for kids. Horses are a lot of work, but they are a lot of fun. Eye Haw!

B00APUQJLO|1.0|I did not even get past the first 15 minutes of this movie, I just could not stand it. Just not my kind of movie I guess.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|I looked around for the blu-ray/dvd combo and Amazon had the best price on the combo.<br /><br />I love this movie and the gaming references.  Very funny.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|The Hulk really steals the show he was great. Everyone turns in a good performance. Tony is his usual self absorbed rock star. Good summer fun.
B0008ENHUI|5.0|I saw this movie in the &#34;day&#34; when it came out, in theaters.  I have had it on Video for years, and just decided to get it on DVD, since video's will wear out one day - and mine is getting grainy.  this is a great movie...  Very long, excellent story, acting, &#34;messages&#34;, full of everything a good movie should have!  I've watched it many times through the years. It never get's &#34;old&#34;.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This is a page turner. I read it over 2 days and could not put it down. The writing was visual and entertaining. The teen was not just some sullen kid that the parents complain about. It has brought up some great questions in my head that I cannot shake. To what lengths would you help your kid?
B00CDXOXB4|4.0|Great date night movie, for a couple or for the family.  We all enjoyed watching the movie and probably would watch it again
B003D513TQ|5.0|Deft and sensitive handling of a period costume piece - it quickly becomes a love story between two people caught in worlds that want them to be something they are not.  They find the strength in each other to tackle the daunting work ahead of them.  The period-ness doesn't overshadow the well-crafted storytelling.  Great date night movie.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Heartwarming and heartfelt story of a family that somehow, some way finds the will to survive and connect back with each other after such a devestating tragedy.  A+
B000I14UTS|5.0|Excellent movie in terms of Kander and Ebb's excellent score, the fantastic direction and choreography of the iconic Bob Fosse and the unparalleled portrayal of the decadently innocencent Sally Bowles by oscar winner Liza Minelli.
B00CL68QVQ|2.0|Would not pay money again to see this movie.  Thank goodness we didnt pay full price at the theater.  Would want a refund.
B009NY43NY|3.0|Seems like the author lost her train of thought.  Didn't like the way it ended.  Really loved the series up to this one.
B00CFQN12Q|3.0|It's not the first movie and can't say we would watch it again, but still, it's a good movie to enjoy.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Couldn't put it down until I beat it.  Fireproof games nailed a rich  and imaginative puzzle game.  Reminiscent of Myst, which I loved.  Looking forward to the next installment.
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|I wouldn't say it's a great movie, nor would I say it's a bad movie.  We enjoyed watching it.  Would we watch it again, probably not?  But for a one time viewing yes!
B007V2UGPE|1.0|So not worth my time, the graphics are terrible.<br />Look for some thing more entertaining to spend your money on.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|This was the best investment I ever made for my husband to enjoy while we are RV'ing and visiting the grandchildren for a extended stay. I keep finding him escaping for a &#34;West Wing&#34; fix every afternoon. Sharply scripted, excellent cast, and enough intrigue and character development to keep both of us happy. Anyone who enjoys political drama and quick wit will appreciate the writing and directing that went into this series. No wonder it was a hit. Highly recommended.
B00DYTKKGI|1.0|it was so laggy that it wasn't even playable. it was such a waste of time. definately not worth the download
B00B8M4IMK|3.0|I have had better. I have to occasionally push this back down in the lighter socket. It sometimes loses connectivity. Other than that, it is an alright product.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Just wanted to chime and say the Chrome tab casting works better than I had anticipated. My family subscribes to a Japanese TV service which offers live Japanese TV through a flash video player. Up until now we had to have a computer hooked up to the TV with HDMI in order to watch on a big screen but now with Chromecast we can \\"cast\\" the tab that is playing the flash video to the TV. To make this even better you can also use other tabs in Chrome while it's playing the flash video on the TV so basically where before the computer had to be only used for watching TV and had to be hooked up to the TV now it can be used simultaneously to surf the web and on top of that it's wireless.<br /><br />I had feared there would be some choppiness in the video or the audio wouldn't sync with the video but it works perfectly (one disclaimer, it's not HD so I don't know if that matters). The only caveat in my short experience is that it seems to take a lot of system resources on the computer to \\"cast\\" so sometimes it gets choppy for a second if you're doing something else at the same time and every once in awhile you have to stop the cast and restart it (hopefully this will get better with updates but even if not it's not a big deal since it only happens when someone is on the computer so they can easily fix it). I am using the cheapest Macbook so it would probably work better on a nicer computer with a better processor and more memory.<br /><br />Anyways, this thing is great, so much better than connecting via HDMI. Youtube also works amazingly well as everyone else has mentioned.
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|Ugh! This was the WORST! The only 2 good things about this movie are James Francos good looks and the tiny little glass girl. I was intrigued by the movie since, obviously, the Wizard of Oz is amazing and also because I loved the book Wicked. This movie was aweful!
B00881VLCE|5.0|Great. keeps you in interest if you like puzzles. Keep them coming and I will play it forever. Good luck.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|Because the bad guys are so bad, the good guys are ... forgivable. As one might expect, super violent, but Q.Tarantino makes it work. Loved it!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|It does not support iphones, ipads, or surface rt. There are only a few apps that work with it, netflix, you tube, supposedly chrome but that does not work yet for me.  If you have a tv or dvd or blueray player that allows streaming don't waste your money.  They work better than the chrome cast.  For $35 dollars it is still a waste of money.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Neil Gaiman does it again. Beautifully told, this tale of a summer in a young boy's childhood drew me in and held me through the very end. Perfect for reading aloud. Finished it last night and-- I never do this so quickly--I'm going to re-read it again this weekend!
B0085TKAW6|5.0|Enthralling from start to finish. Absolutely loved it. Very hard to put down once you started reading. Recommend it to both young and old.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|This movie was great.  It made me laugh and cry.  What a sweet story with a beautiful picture of two unique worlds colliding.
B00DSY8D36|2.0|Maybe I don't know what I'm doing with this app but, it just isn't working for me. I want to underline a section but the lines are very thin, keep changing to yellow after being changed to another color, and only partially underlines what I want. I'll keep working with it to get the hang of it. I am frustrated at this point.
B0000041WV|5.0|This is an excellent collection of the best Dvorak symphonies. They are a pleasure to listen to and help to generate a variety of moods. Some are slow, some are fast, some are motivating and direct. Dvorak is doing his best! I highly recommend this multi-disc set for the classical music or general music collector!!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Stop reading reviews and read the book.  While few reviews here are outright spoilers they will taint your experience.  This world is best experienced with no preconceptions.<br /><br />There are many Wool books.  They break down into the Wool series and then the Shift series.  The books are available a la carte, but you want the Wool Omnibus which includes the original Wool short story and the next 4 books.  After that the Shift Omnibus series.  Also know there are fan based extensions to the Wool canon and there is a final Wool installment by Howey due out this fall.
B0063M22QO|2.0|It's not that fun and missing some spark. After playing a couple of minutes I'm done and bored big time
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This movie has something for everyone, for kids, for adults, and for those in-between.  It is a lot of fun to watch.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|I find this game to be both fun and educational.  The graphics are great and the characters are accurate to the story. Adults and kids alike will enjoy building a reef with Nemo.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|I must say. This version of MTG has done an exceptional job at giving me my Magic fix. It's fun to look at a lot of newer cards I'm not familiar with and see how they are played.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|all in all it a nice game i hope u can make more like this.<br />maybe u can make monters run.

B009NFHF0Q|5.0|\\"The Ocean at the End of the Lane\\" is a terrific book, and by terrific I mean both in the bowdlerized sense of \\"superb,\\" and in its literal meaning of exciting fear.  Neil Gaiman's novelette is the perfect summer read, lyrical and haunting.  The story is beautifully written, intellectually intriguing and viscerally scary.  It's been a long time since I've read a book that I couldn't put down.<br /><br />The story simply put concerns a sensitive, seven-year old boy living a somewhat unhappy childhood in England despite seeming to have a normal, supportive family.  After a boarder in his home commits suicide, Lettie Hempstock, an eleven-year old girl living with her mother and grandmother on a farm up the road, befriends the boy.  As she attempts to resolve mysterious events related to the suicide, the reader begins to realize that she's not your average farmgirl.  Despite her touching solicitousness towards the boy, Lettie inadvertently lets hell loose in his life.  She is thereafter resolved to set things straight for him.<br /><br />Gaiman employs colors (in particular, orange, grays, and reds) and textures (ragged, rough, sharp) that underscore otherworldiness, sickliness, and fear.  Conversations are often terse and tense, punctuated by silence or reflection.  There are moments that invoke a feeling of horror, others that inspire a sense of wonder, and still others, more rare yet, that convey tenderness.  There's probably much to unpack in this story, and I don't think I unpacked very much at all, but nonetheless I certainly enjoyed reflecting on the nature of memory, of immortality, and the possibility of different realities, perceived and real.<br /><br />Gaiman writes so vividly, I'm not surprised to learn that the book has been optioned as a movie, to be produced by Tom Hanks.  I urge you, though, to read the book.  It's the perfect complement to a balmy late summer's eve.<br /><br />(A note on age appropriateness: the story involves some disturbing scenes of death and supernatural terror, including between parent and child, and there is a short passage involving a sexual encounter, but none of this is graphically rendered.  I think the novel is appropriate for mature teens and adults.)death and supernatural terror, including between parent and child, and there is a short passage involving a sexual encounter, but none of this is graphically rendered.

B005544TRQ|5.0|to hit TV in a long time.  Funny, serious and great writing. Hope this series will be around for a long time to come.
B00BH0VSM6|1.0|This is so bad I thought someone other than Jo Nesbo wrote it.  Truly, truly mediocre - couldn't even finish it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is super fun. The minions are hilarious and the game is challenging enough to keep you coming back for more.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Not as good as his first--but better than his second.  When we get done with the book club discussion, I might like it better.
B009PNQUXO|5.0|This app is perfect for the kindle fire HD. I have been using it non-stop and it has shown zero problems, i do recommend this app if u have a Kindle!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I got my Chromecast today.  It took about 1 minute of easily guided set up to configure from my laptop, then it immediately starts working.  I have streamed video from YouTube, from regular internet sites, and music from Amazon's Cloud Player, and all played first try without issue.  I also tested it playing YouTube videos from my phone, also with no issues.  My favorite part is that it is only streaming one tab, so you can still keep doing other things on your laptop while streaming to the TV.  For $35, I couldn't be happier.  Now I am just looking forward to them adding more integrated apps.
144937980X|4.0|An excellent introductory book for processing, with a lot of samples to use and modify.<br />I recommend it for anyone interested in programming for media manipulation.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is great,you explore the land and see and build fantastic civilizations you should play this game if you like build and planing out stuff
B000FA5SMK|4.0|Like all his novels this one is hard to put down. John Corey is not my favorite protagonist, I love John Sutter from Gold Coast and Gate House, but it had a good story line and it was suspenseful.

Now I have the Accuweather app because of the new upgrade to The Weather Channel app is horrible.  I would love to have the old version back.  Unless it changes, I will be deleting this app.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|What a beautiful rendition of sci-fi fiction, simply fabulous and breath taking panaromas, great perspective toward life, in another words, this movie is intelligently mind boggling. Do yourself a favor and go watch it. Don't go by those rotten reviews scattered all over the internet, this movie deserve 5, not because it has Tom Cruise only but the way post-apocalypse scenario is shown, whao.. beautifully told story. Tet or Ted, I dunno Sally in it.. reminded me of HAL from 2001:Space Odyssey.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The best game I know beside minecraft maybe even better and you will love this game so git it you will love it.
1781162646|5.0|Great Story! One of my top five favorite stories by Stephen King. Ranks with The Green Mile and the short The Body. A must read for any Stephen King fan.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I could not put this book down. It was one of the most inspiring books I have read in while. Yes, at times I cringed during the parts detailing the author's self-destructive behavior (and maybe TMI in regard to hygiene issues), but at the same time, the honesty with which she writes her book is what makes it so incredibly heart wrenchingly good. I recommend this book with all of my heart.
B000HC2LI0|3.0|I was a big fan of the series.  Watched when it originally aired, later when rerun on Bravo.  And again when it became available streaming on Netflix and Amazon.<br /><br />I wanted the extras, and there's no guarantee how long streaming content will remain available.<br /><br />As others have written, the boxed set design is poor - cardboard with slots to hold each disc.  Potential to scratch the discs.<br /><br />I was most disappointed by the lack of extras.  While the first season set contains extras (obviously recorded after the third or fourth season) as the seasons progress, there are fewer and fewer extras.  I didn't expect explanations of why Moira Kelly or Rob Lowe left.  But I was surprised that there was no extras about the changing cast as the Santos candidacy and election became prominent storylines.  Or the treatment of Bartlett's MS crisis/China trip.  Not one memorial comment about John Spencer.  And not even the expected comments about ending the series after 7 years.<br /><br />While I'm glad to own the series, I'm disappointed by the lack of extra insights into a program I believe to be one of the best things ever produced for network TV.
B000JQUZCI|5.0|The original story in full detail.  Once I started reading it I couldn't put it down.<br />Many movie versions have been made but none stand up to the source.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game. I suggest it to anyone who likes this kind of game. What can be more fun then the running of the minons
B00122Z7NK|5.0|I waited too long before purchasing this album.  Great from top to bottom.  It was released in 2007 and yet the music is still relevant today and probably will be for a long time.  The little nuances and dangerously heavy bass make this record an enjoyable listen that will be sure to have you dancing in no time.  If you dig Bad Company UK and Daft Punk (to name a few common artists), give this a chance.
B008X9Z4I8|4.0|I chose this case because I was looking for something with style and inexpensive.  The only thing I didn't like was it did not have an inside pocket.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Probably obsessive about time and date on electronic devices; however I quit wearing a watch when I retired and having them available on my cell and my Kindle as well as my computer is great.
030758836X|1.0|Cannot believe this is one of the top selling books of Summer 2013. From the start the main characters (Nick and Amy) are annoying, self-absorbed hipster types, having an unfashionable move from NYC to small town America. The other characters are all so faceless and completely undeveloped considering their early introduction, Go in particular.<br />For me there was no element of 'whodunnit' at all. I remember being about quarter the way through wondering what the following three quarters had in store. There are some good twists in the story and the writing isn't bad (though there are sometimes 'big words' put in for the sake), but the end - you cannot call it that - is just so lame. It was like the writer bit off more than she could chew and then tried to make it all go away by hiding in a corner and getting her fairy God Mother make all good again.<br />As another reviewer said the story is like Swiss cheese with all the holes.<br />To conclude: give it a miss!
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|One of the best apps ever who ever dousent have this app douse not know what his/her is missing out on
0671004107|4.0|Fairly entertaining sci-fi book with frequent references to popular scientific theories from the 80's and infrequent attacks on religion. The book was closely imitated by the popular movie of the same name and I found the book more enjoyable. Certainly a classic sci-fi from a classic era of sci-fi writers.

B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This is a really fun game where you get to basiclly have a zoo and you can even get dinosaurs too! I love it and its so much fun. And i recomend it to anyone who loves animals and dinosaurs!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is a great way to kill some time, challenging at times, yet simple enough to still be fun.
B005J3IEZQ|4.0|Much of what you read you have heard before but not in such a good context.<br />A very readable and well put together book. Could have done with a little editing<br />(shortening) but the deadlines we put on the writer by Steve Jobs death most<br />likely.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I use this app every day.  The additions are not that great.  I check the weather for where I am, where I'm going and where I want to be.  I like the daily  and weekly forecast.  Those really are the most useful to me.
B00746TURW|3.0|The story doesn't seem to end up anywhere interesting. A long read but very little advance!<br />Where was the author intending to take us?
B0055PGUYU|3.0|Interesting read. The marketing examples were the most interesting part. Third section of the book seemed tangential and out of place.
B005OKTPKC|4.0|This is very readable and I liked it very much. Good story and well told (as usual)<br />How does he keeo doing it?
B004J4WLB4|5.0|One of the best.  Emotional,  hard to put down, became totally involved with each character.  A must read for those who care about people, relationships and nature.
B00A6VAW9W|5.0|Been following Kenny since early1970s with Jim Messina then all his great solo stuff through the 80's and 90's and 2000's. This new group sound is very diverse with three songwriters and three lead vocalists, amazing harmonies.  Loggins is excited about the new band and for good reason. Shades of CSN, Eagles, Fleetwood Mac, Poco, Pure Prairie League, and new country guy-girl bands.  Special thanks to Joe Walsh, whose guitar licks are all over this album.  If you are a fan of California Classic Rock, Southern Rock and New Country, run out and buy this CD!
B0091REZMW|4.0|This game is addicting and I can't put it down, I play it everywhere I go. I look for more games like this. Love it!
B008B92U32|2.0|I thought this would be a fun diversion, but it's kind of lame. The instructions aren't very good, so I had trouble figuring out what to do. Could have been my own fault. As it turns out, there are better apps available to pass the time with. But if you can get it free or cheap, you might want to experiment with it. I'm a senior. Maybe young people would find it more intriguing.
B004WMKSH2|4.0|&#34;The Deathly Hallows&#34; book was very long, and I understand (other than making more money) why they decided to do it in two parts.  However, this Part I really drags a bit.
B005LHOKFS|5.0|I'm crazy about TripAdvisor. It's so great for researching places to go and stay and ways to get there. I love that you can read the reviews of people who have been there and get their take on the experience. The interface is well designed and an excellent resource for people on the go. I hope all travelers will be diligent about submitting reviews, because it certainly helps to get their perspective and not just that of the proprietors.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|This was very much better than 'Quantum of Solace'  which was badly done, and really a bit boring.<br /><br />In any case, I'm really opposed to this current trend toward humanizing Bond.  Stick with the old paradigm.<br /><br />And, I'm sorry they're writing Judi Dench out of the series, but I think she deserves a rest.  Ralph Fiennes will be a good 'M.'
B00AKO93JK|4.0|This app is great for Android tablet devices. It takes you through a complete workout routine, but it's also divided into logical sections that target certain areas so you can choose one routine to work on if you don't want to go through the entire program. The demonstration of the movements is excellent, but you should be aware that it's a female instructor should that make a difference to you. When you start an exercise, she demonstrates what you are supposed to do for a few seconds and then the timer starts for your routine. Pretty cool.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This is not Bohjalian's best. I have enjoyed many of his novels, but this one, not so much. However, this one is not so formulaic as some of his novels, and that's good. I did enjoy the Gatsby connection.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|To truly enjoy the game you HAVE TO BUY pearls. I refuse to spend real money on digital \\"things\\" for any game. Nemos is a product aimed at children, this game should not require them to spend money to get the \\"cool\\" stuff or to advance in the game.  Graphics are nice, music is soothing, concept is good but will be very frustrating and/or disappointing for your child unless you are willing to throw away some real money on it.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Managed to get the last Chromecast from my local BB (an associate had hidden one under the counter but gave it up). They had sold 43 in one day. A few minutes fiddling with the proper inputs and, using my Samsung Skyrocket III as the controller, I had it going. I plugged it into an HDMI port on my home theater receiver, then ran an HDMI cable from that to an HDMI input on my TV. That way I can use my Logitech Harmony One remote to switch from my cable box to the Chromecast and use the Harmony One to control volume and switch back to other sources later. I still need to use the phone to start Netflix. This gadget may allow me to shut down my home theater PC, which, since it uses a VGA input, has not quite as nice a picture as the HDMI inputs. For now, the HTPC does allow use of other video browser sites like Project Free TV for the stuff that is not on Netflix. Setup was easy. You have to download the Chromecast application from the Google Play Store, but my Netflix and You Tube apps were already up to date for selecting the Chromecast. The Harmony One did not have the Chromecast as a device, but I used the earlier Google TV object and just changed the name. Since there is no controller for the Chromecast, the Harmony One only needed to set the receiver and TV to the proper inputs.

B005RJ69YK|5.0|Miss Emerald is a very talented singer, with strong voice and a style that harkens back to yesteryear. Her orchestra is also extremely talented. I like every song on the cd.<br /><br />The import dvd wasn't properly formatted for my region, so it wouldn't play in my blue ray player. On a whim, I tried it in my pc's dvd drive, and it worked! The dvd has a full concert and several music videos on it. Watching her perform \\"live\\" brought my appreciation for her to a new level. She flows effortlessly from song to song, doing one right after another, and her orchestra plays flawlessly! Her songs are lively and fun, and she's definitely worth the price of admission!

B006YGC7KK|5.0|Action spiced by intrigue ... twisty plots ... secret agents laying traps within traps ... highly visual, stylistic combat -- sounds great, right?  But what if each story were also anchored to a bedrock of moral dilemma?  And what if that anchor was the most interesting and most good-looking secret agent since James Bond?<br /><br />Watch the episodes in order from the first season for maximum emotional impact.  The original TV series (La Femme Nikita) is also outstanding, in much the same way, but is in no way needed to thoroughly enjoy this one.<br /><br />-dd
B003O86FMW|5.0|Very beautifully written, has a nice and steady flow, and very easy to get sucked into. I don't think I've ever flown through a book so fast as I did Catching Fire. Amazing book, a must read for anyone. Deserving of 5 stars.
0812992784|3.0|Documenting Rushdie's 13 years evading the fanatical Islamic fatwa against him, it is the first and last chapters that are the \\"meat\\" of \\"Joseph Anton.\\" The rest is more like a daily diary \\"bun.\\" His most poignant assessments of radical Sunni and Shia Islam's emergence and impact are limited to a few pages. This work could be edited down, chopping the narrow-view rehash of his social activities to include more wide-lens commentary on radicalism.<br /><br />Like Rushdie's previous works, he writes melodically. He punctuates his insights and plot points with rich descriptions and historical background. Rushdie conveys deserved gratitude to benevolent and trusted friends. He describes the toll on his (ex-) wives and children. But Rushdie's journal-like recitations of all-star acquaintances and celebrity run-ins become redundant -- bordering on name-dropping. As one of the most visible and unjust targets of Islamic fundamentalist terrorism, I hoped Rushdie would draw more lucid broad-view connections -- and biting conclusions -- between his February 1989 fatwa and the September 2001 and July 2005 terrorist attacks.

B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Love this game... I spend wayyy too much time playing. Sometimes I even have to plug in the Kindle Fire so the battery won't go dead

You tube a sample.<br /><br />There are better groups in Iceland where everyone has a Master's Degree.<br /><br />Iceland's (I think) Kaleo or something is a dynamite group.<br /><br />Iceland is a like a mini-civilization within itself.<br /><br />Was shocked at how good Iceland radio is.

B000OVLINI|5.0|Carlos Zafon's Julian Carax  is a form of Emily Bronte's Heathcliff.  The two are stoic men and in love with women they shouldn't be. This novel is an odyssey which duplicates itself and entwines the reader into its words.  Is it written in the stars that some loves should never be?  Are star-crossed lovers destined to be pitied or envied for the love they share, even if for a short while?  The Shadow of the Wind has it all.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Wonderful game I love it.  It reminds me of dynamite that I used to play as a kid. It's fun for younger kids as well.
B002TXZRNQ|5.0|To begin with, get ready to cry even if you are strong. That's the strength of the relationship of the two characters. I love the easy to connect with narrative and it's ability to draw us into the story with a sense of anticipation as we get answers to our actions in daily life which we do without giving them much thought. This one has to be on everyone,s list of books to read before they die.
B0001WE6U2|4.0|I broke the original one that came with Nikkor lens and it is identically to the original. Well constructed and if you ask me with more careful treatment from my part it will hold for years to come.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|We enjoyed this movie.  Denzel Washington did a great job as always.  Makes one worry though when one boards a plane.
1439148953|5.0|This was listed as lightly used. Except for the previous owner's name in the front, it didn't appear used at all. Arrived on time.
B000H5U832|5.0|Grandson loves cars and loves this movie!  So glad I purchased it.  He's a happy camper when this is on!
1594746036|4.0|I buy books for my grandson, read them first, then we talk about all the characters in the story. However, I was hooked by the third chapter.  I could not put the book down: WWII background, bombing raids, references to hidden children's orphanage for protection, historical references of UK history during war. Persecution of a certain group of people and their supposely peculairities. I believe history interwoven with fantasy, whimsy, haunting violent situations. A great summer read adventure mystery for any teenager and grandma...MrsLos
B00BG0RSJ4|5.0|Got this for my grandson along with several other DVDs.  He loves books, but is fascinated with cartoons, also.  Great way to spend some time with him!
B0064MGU98|5.0|It's a good TV show. I am not surprised why so many people watched and put comments on it. The story happened in Chicago. I feel it just happen in the neighborhood. It based on real world story. Love it.
B009B1UZ7C|5.0|This boy is brilliant!!  I absolutely love this cd and from the first split second to the last split second it fascinates and amazes me!!  This is the type of music that is so rare where you actually can't wait to listen to it over and over again knowing that you will find something you missed the last time with every new listen.  Lyrically and vocally it is pure brilliance!!  RECOMMENDED TO EVERYONE ON EARTH AND ELSEWHERE TOO!!
0061777269|3.0|More examples needed - less techincal aspects and studies. Interesting subject matter on examples presented. Too mamny pages repeating same information.
B000X2H8G4|5.0|I bought these for my mom and she called to tell me it worked great for bible study. She had separate ones for each ear and would loose them. These will be easier to find. She loved the fact that she could hold the volume in her hand and adjust it for people that talk louder or softer or way down if she didn't want to hear someone. lol  I think maybe some feathers or crystals attached to the headphones might make them look better. But they work great, and way cheaper than hearing aids.
B00493SIIA|5.0|Great book and trying to get my wife to read it.<br />Book report:  be frugal to get rich. Word word.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|What great fun.  No resident geek, and yet we solve mysteries. one, two, three, four, five, six seven, eight, nine.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I loved this game. Really kept me quessing. Cant wait for more puzzles like this!!! Just wish there were more levels to play.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|Its practicaly tf2 but with fewer classes. Great for tf2 fans worth your time and the best fps made by gameloft. Four thumbs up
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|the vector level is hard but its an awesome game love it. I love it love it love it love it love it.
B006RXQBUC|4.0|Great movie, great cast. Portrays life on the early NYC streets. Story line keeps you focused, no lulls in story.
B00985E3UG|5.0|An even sided look at the conflict between good tasting and good for you food. Focuses primarily on large company tactics but also defines the consumers role in the various health crisis caused by processed food.
B001XUH69Y|5.0|This is a must see classic for a new generation. I never get tired of seeing it. Don't pass this one by.
B00D2K40WY|4.0|If its about fashion, my granddaughters love it.  They spent a lot of time with this one. Would buy again.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I have enjoyed the weather channel app for quite some time, but was horrified by the redesign.  It is a mess and the point system is ridiculous. I use this app for weather, not surveys and points.  I would not recommend this new version to anyone.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|They never played with it so I can't say if it was really good or not.  Better to let them pick out the games, that to anticipate what they will lile.
B00B8WXG9G|5.0|Have loved Paul since I was a teenager and was so happy to listen to this newest CD.  He still has  what it takes.
B004EPZ034|3.0|They never played with it so I can't say if it was really good or not.  Better to let them pick out the games, that to anticipate what they will lile.
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|Amazon APP used to &#34;rent&#34; -- Worked well.  The movie was good.  I loved the fact that you were able to watch the movie as much as you wanted for the 24 hour rental period.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|They never played with it so I can't say if it was really good or not.  Better to let them pick out the games, that to anticipate what they will lile.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This app makes my life easier. Primarily because I don't have to go through my kindle menu  it's really simple to use its definitely not rocket science. I most definitely recommend this app to keep your kindle clean and and to free up space. Go download it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I thought I'd download this for my niece and nephew for when they play with my kindle. Little did I know, I would be playing it. It's absolutely adorable. The graphics are incredible. The only thing is that at times when you're trying to do something it will say that person has upgraded their version. I have yet to figure out how to upgrade the version I have. Also, you need these diamonds to get better items, and unless you buy them it will taked forever to get them. They are my only two complaints. Overall, this is a really kool app. Love it.
B00BGZ8OLA|3.0|There is way too much computer animation.  Read the book.  You will get a lot more out if it and enjoy the journey much more.
B002APU580|5.0|This version is my favorite of the zlllions that have been done.  Good chemistry here between the leads.  Wish they didn't require so many words---
B00C1BTWV4|5.0|I shouldn't have to review this because if you haven't seen it, your life is truly a darker place.  So watch it.
B00D6BN9NK|1.0|Must have cost a fortune to blow up all that stuff---to say the plot was weak is stretching the truth...
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Just want people to be aware that you cannot set this up from iOS, nor does it seem to be able to be set-up from a PC that doesn't have a wi-fi dongle. So even if you have a PC connected to a Wi-Fi router, you will be unable to set this up. The amzon page says \\"works with iOS\\". Yes it will work after you have set it up but if all you have is an iPhone, iPad and a PC connected via ethernet, you have no option to set this up. You need an android device or a PC/Laptop with Windows 7 or higher and a wireless card.
0062255657|3.0|As an easily-creeped out reader, I don't read too much fantasy. I had to skip sections of &#34;Ocean&#34; for that reason. I did enjoy the relationship depicted between the children, the implicit trust in each other, vs. the adults in the novel. The line that adults never say it won't hurt unless it will, very much, in fact, resonated. Looking for the allegorical meaning to determine if worthwhile now.
B009WUBERW|4.0|Of course this is not a movie that was made to win an Oscar, but if you want an action movie, 80's style, you will enjoy it.
B003F1WM2K|5.0|The fluidity.  The heart.  This book made me cry. Happy. Sad. Lovely. Glad.  What artists they r and set w
B00821OX98|4.0|Movie quality is 4 Stars. Much improved audio across the board, now you can hear most of the dialogues without having to blast everything you got. The Falling Skies Season 1 (HD) is a lot of fun, and HD is an added plus. 4 Stars.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This game has many scenes, mysteries and puzzles to solve. It was interesting, and I could play it again with just as much fun. I look forward to part 2.
B005ZCXPP0|4.0|it was worth watching had a strange twist but I thought I was a good movie that the whole family could watch
B004UJTG6Q|4.0|Mark Twain is a great story teller.  This book is an American classic and don't let anyone tell you different.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|But all in all they could have done more with this script,<br />comparing it to the UK version of way back I found it interesting to see this idea reworked in nowadays.<br />Kevin S is great, as he always is and the other actors also do a formidable job but somehow, I am missing a certain edge, perhaps in the next season?
B005HE5J7I|2.0|I haven't read the other city(and country) epics of Mr. Rutherfurd and I can't imagine doing so.  I won't even recommend them to my teen age children.  Why not just write the fascinating history of these wonderful places without including the wooden,  lifeless fictional characters that just gum up the story.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Short and sweet. Probably one of the best imaginary sagas I have read. It keeps you hooked interested in the different characters easily. I'm going into my 4th book of the saga
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|Don't get me wrong, I LOVE fluff!! I like my predictable, happy ending. But the resolution was a bit too easy and a bit too quick. Just felt a wee bit anticlimactic. Gotta love Josh Dahumel though. Yowza.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Overall pleased with this book. Much better than the movie. The characters are much more fleshed out in the book.
B008OE05IG|5.0|This documentary about hard work, and high demands from self.<br />Persistence and perseverance always results in success.<br />Highly influential example of human abilities.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game was a lot of fun. The challenges and puzzles were just right. I got really stumped on the last 2 floors, but over all it was challenging, but not overly frustrating. I did need to search for help to solve one of the puzzles, as I'd never seen that sort before. I hope to see more updates soon.
1451688091|5.0|Would recommend these two books to anyone interested in history.  The books give a lot of insight of the tiimes and relationships between the main characters.
B00DP3IGJ6|5.0|What a great movie this was, as a sci-fi fan I absolutely loved it.Seems I have to write at least twenty words here but I don't want to spoil the movie.
B003PBB4ME|5.0|Excellent price! It pretty does the job to a great price. Of course it feels cheap but works great. If you are a beginner in filming (as I am) this is a good choice.
B00479SVBU|3.0|Can't see anything on screen any more after a year and 1 month of operation.<br />The audio is going strong though.
B00DC7NNAC|1.0|Terrible directing, terrible acting, mediocre special effects (by today's standards). Usually I'll play through a movie even if I've decided I don't really like it that much or can't get into it. After about fifteen minutes of Oz I wanted to stop the movie.<br /><br />All the actors were way to stiff, fake and unlikeable. Normally Mila Kunis, James Franco, and Michelle Williams are superb actors, but I think the combination of bad directing and bad writing did them no favors. Not even their talent could save the film. The art direction dragged the film even further down.<br /><br />The special effects felt way too dated and flat, for some reason. The colors were way too artificial, and way too neon. There is color that pops off the screen and then there was this. I could see what they were trying to do with the film; trying to mimic the experience of the original Wizard of Oz. I would respect the homage more if it were done well.<br /><br />Overall I would say the directing and writing really killed this film. The special effects and art direction didn't help it any either. One saving grace of the entire film was seeing the emerald city as it was originally designed in the Wizard of Oz. You get a sense of how massive the city is in the film from the 1930s, but never really get to see it as well defined as it is here. That was about the only poppy I could spot in this field full of weeds.
B00DP3IGJ6|4.0|Very good. Action with a twist. Loved the ending .Best Tom Cruises film I have seen since Days of Thunder
B004X6PRO6|2.0|I was really lo9oking forward to reading this book but I was very disappointed.  Hard to follow, very depressing, and with little redeeming value.  Guess those who select Pulitzer Prize winners and I really disagreed on this one.
0062255657|5.0|This is one of those books where you feel sad when you have finished it as you would like it to go on.  Neil Gaiman manages to touch so many chords of the human spirit and the experiences of childhood,
B005DJREGQ|4.0|Watching a show about a high school girl and all of her many awkward social encounters is entertaining AND a guilty pleasure.  Often hilarious and poignant, the show is well written, well acted, and well cast. A delight to watch.
B005PK57NU|5.0|I like the court scences and the arguments. But Kalinda seems to be overly mysterious! Good stories well told. I like it.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Well I think Fox network realized too late how much money they could of made off this show... it's a shame it was canceled. I am sure fox is kicking them selves in the ass about it too. It's a great western set 500 years in the future with epic dialogue and excellent chemistry between all the actors. A must see.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Really enjoying this game and i love playing with my family and friends. Keep up the good work. Thank you.....cool game
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Well written.  The actors mesh well together.  I enjoy this show.  Fun to watch.  I recommend this to anyone who may like this genre
B009IF8CH6|5.0|The Big Bang Theory always makes me laugh out loud and will often pull out a snort. The characters are hysterical!!!
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|What can I say that has not already been said about MGS? Not much so I will keep this short and simple. To newcomers of the series, look no further, this is the definitive collection, MGS 1-4 + MG1, MG2, Peace Walker and VR missioins. I can say that all of these games are fantastic and here you get them all for 50$ and the added bonuses of an art book and 2 graphic novels.<br /><br />The graphic novels serve like a movie which I was surprised by, they are literally the same length as a full length movie, so far I've only seen the graphic novel of MGS1 and it lasted about 1 hour and 30 mins. The art book that comes with it is pretty neat, I love the art on the cover and the contents are nice. One thing that I was surprised by though is how small it was, I bought this collection thinking it was the same as the HD Collection except with every single game instead of just 3. The box is the same size as a regular ps3 game box and so is the art book. I was expecting a full sized hard cover art book like the HD collection Special Edition book, but at the 50$ asking price I can't say I'm surprised. Still with those minor complaints aside, this is a great deal and a series that should not be missed by anyone with a ps3.<br /><br />Highly recommend it!
B0092SQ5EG|3.0|I found this movie to me interesting and moving. I was curious about the life of Katy Perry and found an admiration for her and her parents.
B00CHILW64|5.0|So very edge of your seat kinda movie. Awesome. Would recommend this movie to anyone who is all about movies. The Good Ones Anyway.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's fun and entertaining it's a great app for kids. And for adults and it had great funny costumes that you can purchase  it's really funny how they act. I would tell everyone about this game  it's one of the best running action games I ever played^_^
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|We really enjoyed this show. We thought it would be boring but it really keeps you interested. A lot of twists and turns, ups and downs. It was very enjoyable. Always had to watch one more.<br />The actors do a great job portraying that time period. We can't wait for the next season.
B002QKZLZ6|3.0|I haven't thought of using the carrier that often but I can imagine it coming in handy when I am traveling a lot more.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|For only $35, you can stream videos on your tv from almost any device. It is very easy to set up, and to use.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Purchased in October 2011 - these headsets are awesome!  If you are looking to purchase a Wireless headset as a gift (for your gamer friend) and not sure what to get - GET THIS ONE!!!  Worth every single Penny.  Remember, it's Wireless and can be charged while in use!  Enjoy  :)
B00275EGWY|5.0|I think this movie did an excellent job of portraying what our military is facing in the Middle East.  Jeremy gives an awesome performance
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I can't tell which is more intense--the politics or the battles with swords. Either way, great series. Onward to book 3!
B004VOBIE8|3.0|I have not used the file manager to a great extend. But it seems to be functional for its purpose.
B009CG29RK|5.0|Love this movie as do the kids.  Classic stuff with Dru and all the cast.  Kids watch it over and over again.
B000W453KQ|5.0|I first saw this movie when it was released back in 1976.  I was 18 and thought it would be something I would want to see again someday.  Well, I'm 54 now and I will watch this movie anytime I have the chance. Such a touching story of a love that was so strong but yet somehow was not enough.  Streisand and Redford have such a chemistry between them which makes this more believable and Streisand got so into her character that she was believable throughout this movie.  Some parts I think were unnecessary (Beekman Place) but who's to say....You can feel that the love is still there in that final hug...You can see the love in both of their eyes as they sadly realize that it truly is the end of their romance.  Her tears are genuine for she has to say \\"see ya\\" to the love of her life and realizes that live has to go on.  I would give this more than 5 stars if I could...Wonderful movie....wonderful acting...wonderful song....
B00005QGAZ|5.0|I owned this album earlier in my old life, but loved it and wanted it again.  So it's the same, but better because I appreciate it more for having it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is the second time I've read this book and it was just as good as the first time! I can't wait to see what they do in the film in November!
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I admit it, I got caught up in the hype of this thing. I also know its still a work in progress as more apps are still being developed, but out of the box all I'm able to do is stream YouTube videos.  I spent quite a bit of time trying to get Netflix working with my MacBook, iPhone, and iPad. I have not been able to play a single movie through the Netflix and chromecast combo. I've looked for answers on both Netflix and google (through feedback) and haven't had any luck. I'm surprised that everyone else was able to get it up and running so quickly, I must be missing something
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Contents review:<br />Mouse is as advertised, gamers delight.  I will say that the case that the weights come in is a bit ridiculous but that's just a personal opinion.  Eight weights in a case that is about 2 1/2 inches in diameter when each weight is smaller than a pea.<br />5/5 stars<br /><br />Dimensions review:<br />Overall, this mouse is built for people with large hands and is one of the most comfortable fits I have ever had.  The button placements on the top and side are further apart then normal gaming mouses which aids in preventing accidental clicking.  This is helpful for those with normal hand sizes and larger.  However, for those with smaller than normal hands, they might find it a bit cumbersome to hit the right button when the time calls for it.<br />The issue of possibly loosing the weights in the mouse's case appears to have been addressed from a previous reviewer.  I saw that this might be an issue from a previous review so I tried to get a weight to fall into the case and could not do so.  If this was a problem before, it no longer is.  Kudos.<br />4/5 stars<br /><br />GUI review:<br />Not much to say here.  It is a gaming mouse and reacts as such.  Mouse movement and button reaction speeds are almost instantaneous.  For normal, everyday reaction with the desktop, this mouse is extreme overkill.<br />5/5 stars<br /><br />Software review:<br />If it were anymore customizable, it would do everything itself.<br />5/5 stars<br /><br />Overall review:<br />If you want a mouse for the everyday stuff, I wouldn't recommend this but it will do the trick.  With all the functionality and customizable features, you'd be better off with a basic mouse where nothing gets wasted.  The only real issue I have with this mouse is it's size versus the size of the users hands.  It fits comfortably in my hand but I'm not so sure it will be like that for people with smaller hand sizes.<br />19/20 stars (I'll round up to a 5/5 for amazon)
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I use it at least twice the week, it is so cool. I am still learning all that I can do with this app. I know there are many more uses to and for it.
B00005JKG7|5.0|Definitely a favorite that I've watched and enjoyed many times.  One of the best ghost stories ever filmed, with a marvelous cast, wonderful atmosphere, and some really spooky moments.  Carpenter managed to do quite a lot with very little.  If I have any complaint at all, it's with the brief appearance of John Houseman as a grizzled old fisherman telling ghost stories with a very cultured voice.  Raw-ther.<br /><br />This is the movie that proves it doesn't pay to be a weather man.<br />When the fog comes calling, don't open the door.<br /><br />I hear you knocking but you can't come in!
1609613937|5.0|This book changed the way I eat and the way I live. McDougall is the best. Buy this book!!! You wont regret it!
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|Two hours of pure viewing pleasure!!!  Casting director did well by choosing Brad Pitt!! Brad is one of my favorite actors<br />  J.Owen
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|It is a delightful movie, particularly for a music lover living in a retirement community.  Maggie Smith can do no wrong.
B00DP3IGJ6|4.0|With the Sci-Fi genre seemingly suffering beneath the weight of old series and remakes, Oblivion does the genre justice. Based on a graphic novel, it may not be truly novel fiction, but it certainly explores a story unseen in my memory. With tastes of Firefly, Moon, and others of the theme, it kept my interest. Freeman, Riseborough, and Cruise play their roles remarkably well and together make a great team. Eerie and with enough uncertainty to move the film along, Oblivion gets an A for freshness.<br />It unfortunately suffers from the occasional sense of solidarity of older Sci-Fi flicks like 2001 and a lack of answers and depth of other greats.<br />I'd happily watch it again if for nothing else, the eye-candy of the settings and cinematography.
1439163855|5.0|This book is riveting! I read the book before I watched the movie, and the book was much better as it had more details that they had to leave out of the movie due to time restraint. Will definately recommend
B000FBFN1U|5.0|So many twists and turns. Wow!<br />So hard to put down. You get so involved with these characters and what is happening to each one.
B0090SI582|2.0|Why do they keep on making all the Marvel character's weak!?!?<br /><br />First it was Spider-Man 2. He lost his abilities and that was cool! He wanted to be a normal guy again, but the world needed him back! (That's good. First time they did that, and it made sense!)<br /><br />Second, it was Thor. Oh no, he has no hammer? Make the movie about that! He's going to be a hero without it! (Okay, but it's kind of been done.)<br /><br />Third, Iron Man 3. Oh no, he has no armor, but only half the time...so it's okay? That's kind of new right??? What would he do without armor? Be a hero without it?!?! (Really?)<br /><br />Now, the Wolverine. Guess, what? Here we go again!!!<br /><br />Let's make this guy weak!!! How can we do this? That's easy! Let's do it again! Just like what we did with last handful of Marvel movies. Let's just take away all his powers and abilities and make a movie out of it! OMG!!! AGAIN!!!<br /><br />So, if you want to see the Wolverine or should I say Logan, because he actually doesn't want to be called Wolverine and really wants to call himself Logan! Logan! I'm NOT the Wolverine! I'm Logan!!! Why is this movie calling me, the Wolverine? It should be calling me, LOGAN!!!<br /><br />Wait a second? Isn't this the almost the same idea of Spider Man 2? Do I really want to be Spider-Man turned into do I really want to be the Wolverine???<br /><br />Oh yes, I get it! In this movie because he's weak in the head/body/soul basically, everything you can think of--that's him now. Logan's started to let go and really didn't want to be Wolverine. Then, at the end of the movie, he decided he needed his powers and wanted to be a hero again. Go, Spidy, Go!!! Uhhh, I mean Wolverine!<br /><br />I thought this movie didn't have enough action. Used the same concepts over again. Did a okay job with the story for the beginning and end, but failed a lot in the rest of the movie. The director tried too hard to make people laugh and did many comedy scenes.<br /><br />I swear, they're going to cycle this concept over again. Let's do Cap next! Let's just take away his shield and his abilities! It's like watching a whole new movie. NOT!!! They better not try this again with Hulk or Thor 2, or anymore movies or I'm never going to see another Marvel ever again! Yes, I mean it!<br /><br />I don't recommend this movie. Keep your money and just wait for the next X-Men movie.
B00AKL1XPU|2.0|If you place the table and chairs you receive from neighboring zoo in your game before you are told to, just forget playing again. The entire game locks up every time you enter edit mode because it wants you to select an item that isn't there. I have been trying to get past this for 2 days and no luck. Uninstalling now.
B008OW1S3O|5.0|The first song I had heard by Alt-J was Fitzpleasure. I immediately had to Google them and buy the album. I have absolutely no regrets, except I wish I had heard of them sooner.<br />The album starts off with Intro. To me Intro is as much apart of the whole feel of the album as any other song. It starts with an instrumental, led by the piano and percussion, and builds into a truly great, atmospheric song with distorted harmonies and bass and simple guitar and piano work. Intro trails into the first Interlude which is a really defining acapella track which sets Alt-J apart from every other indie band. Tesselate is a more chilled track with interesting lyrics like, \\"Triangles are my favorite shape.\\" Breezeblocks is probably one of my favorite songs on the album. It references the book \\"Where the Wild Things Are\\" and pounds at the keys of the piano, building from the pauses in the music where you can really hear the vocalist telling this story about obsessive love. The harmonies are absolutely brilliant. The bass line once again sets the foundation for this song. A soft guitar interlude mellows everything out before heading into the middle of the album.<br />Personally, I find the album hits a wall slightly at this point. \\"Something Good\\", \\"Dissolve Me\\", \\"Matilda\\", and  \\"MS\\", aren't nearly as memorable as the rest of the songs. Their a lot less energetic and ambient, and are headed towards a more beach-y feel in the case of \\"Something Good\\". They're still good songs, but they probably won't be one my favorites.<br />But then Fitzpleasure comes about. It starts out with acapella, \\"Tra la, la, la\\"s and then quickly drops the bass and becomes a synth-heavy, almost electronic song. It's addictive and energetic and sets a mood that I can't really put my finger on. Another interlude and then my absolute favorite song on the entire album: Bloodflood. This song is lovely, to say the least. It's atmospheric, ambient, and just brilliant. The part of the song I can't seem to getenough of is the,\\"Breathe in, exhale\\" part. Something about actually hearing him inhale adds to the song immensely. By the end where it absolutely crescendos, there's a a song that defines and summarizes the album. Taro finishes the album, with a soft and well-written song.<br />If you do buy a physical copy, I suggest leaving the album going for about two or three minutes after Taro finishes.<br />Don't get turned off by the vocalist, and try to really pay attention to the music. Listen to this album with a good pair of headphones the first time. This album is really worth buying in my opinion.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love this show! You will not be disappointed. It is very interesting to see the lives of the elite in early 20th century England. Can't wait to watch more!
B0023SDPS6|5.0|I love the new Longmire TV series, but the book is even better.  A Cold Dish is a  crime story with great characters.
B001AQTWF2|5.0|Loved the song &#34;I Look to You&#34;. Album was well worth the money. CD arrived in great condition and just as described.
B000244EMO|5.0|What's not to like it's  classic Schwarzenegger! Still holds up after all these years, Best part is it came in near  prefect shape.
B004A8ZWSS|1.0|I purchased this move...TWICE!  Neither will play on my DVD player, my BluRay player, nor even my laptop dvd player.  Both disks are either blank or encypted to where the player will not even recognize that there is a disk inserted.  But, since the movie seems to suck to other reviewers anyways, I guess I am not missing much.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I can hardly wait until season 4! The characters are great...there are a few I wish they would get rid of (I am sure you know who they are)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|easy game. it takes time to master the levels but it's. really fun for all the family.hope you have fun.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|My husband and I were so sad to see it end.  Like saying good by to dear and wonderful friends.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This book was really good and I really enjoyed the suspense and everything. I can not wait to read the next book.
B00CXQL828|5.0|easily one of the best albums in a long time. just when i thought one song was my favorite, it changes to another. i knew sheehan and portney were badass, but i honestly never was familiar with kotzen and his truly awesome talents.  highest possible recommendation ...
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game. It is fun to interact with the minions. This is a great app to download. I recommend to download it.
B004TI5N38|5.0|Having read The Forgotten already, I was really looking forward to 'backing up' to read this first book in the series.  That said, I was also a bit nervous about reading it out of order.  I guess that's what being &#34;conflicted&#34; means.  All for naught.  David's storytelling is impeccable!  At the beginning of The Forgotten the reader is told that something horrific happened in Zero Day, but no details given.  So, if you haven't read Zero Day as yet, sit down, buckle up and get ready for a ride that is now definitely Baldacci!  I'm off to read book one in the King and Maxwell series :-)
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I absolutely love this game!! I use to play Subway Surfers but now I have replaced that with Despicable Me. I recommend this game to EVERYONE!
B0017VT5E8|2.0|I have three boys and thought it would be fun to see Rocky. They have heard of him but didn't really understand all the hype. After a few minutes, we turned it off because of the unnecessary overuse of foul language.
B0054LJGWS|1.0|I know that this book has been popular, sold lots of copies, but I thought it was awful.  I teach a college course on the end times and Good Omens was highly recommended to use with my students, but I won't be doing that.  It's poorly written, the cultural references are considerably out of date -- 1980s at best -- and the plot just doesn't hang together.
B00740FMTS|4.0|So I got the book just because. I got Bioshock: Ultimate Rapture Edition for $20, so I got the tie-in book since I saw it. I've read a couple of game books before, with fairly consistent results: does good service to the game and an enjoyable read, but nothing particularly noteworthy. That being said, this was one of the few books I would've read without knowing anything about the games. (Though I played the games before reading the book. Just saying.) The writing style fits the Rapture atmosphere very well: dark, taking time to be artistic, but to very to the point. It takes the time to set up everything in the games while still having its own entangling plot that makes you keep turning pages. There are a few instances where things don't 100% add up, such as the death of Andrew's mistress, but these are few and far between. Overall, a very good book. (Note: suggest you play the game, at least the first one, before reading. There are many spoilers.)
B0053O89WY|5.0|Have all of the Seasons up to date, looking forward to the next.  They are always funnyt and we watch all three disks one after the other.  So much better than waiting for next week on TV.
B008Y6WMEY|5.0|I have a bias for dark comedy and nuclear dramas in general,  but this is still an outstanding movie by any standard.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Been using it for 8 weeks and so far loving it.  The mouse has a good grip and it feels natural in your hand.
B00CU8OVIM|5.0|I've been listening to J cole since his mixtape days.  This album is GREAT, way better than his freshman album &#34;Sideline Story&#34;.  If you've never heard him before, give this a play straight through.  Cover art on the front is nice.  Shipped FAST
1846551455|5.0|Well written.  I always guess wrong on who the culprit is, and when the person is revealed I love how this author develops his characters.
B00A8KJN14|4.0|I doubt anything tops Nightmare Before Christmas, but it was ok. My 3 year old nephew was over and watched, and I believe he gave it a thumbs up in a sort of toddler way.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book is beautiful. The story is unique. No wonder it's now a movie. But I have a habit of reading the book first before I watch the movie. So I hope the movie lives up to my expectation. Ha. But this book is a work of art. Matthew Quick is a GENIUS.
B005LAIIJY|4.0|I doubt he ever makes something as great as Reservoir Dogs or Pulp Fiction again, but it's definitely not the worst movie I've seen all year.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Great book.  The series follows the book to a T.  This is a great way to refresh your memory of what has happened while waiting for the next season to begin.  AWESOME!!
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I loved this book, better than the Kite Runner.  To follow the lives of Afghan women was truly inspiring and thought-provoking.
B00BO0GYW8|5.0|I loved this novel.  I've heard terrible reviews and great reviews about it.  I love that it was exciting even though it wad only just interviews during the aftermath.
B00005A46T|5.0|Great high energy Metal music. Great vocals and guitars and a speed king on the drums. Plays double bass drum like a crazy man.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Story told from the guys perspective.  Very entertaining and sexy!  Refreshing format, different from the typical romance novel.  Highly recommended!
B000MQC9H4|5.0|Corky love story but a great film to watch during the fall or winter. The style of the director is unique and is seen in all her movies.
1401308201|5.0|It was every thing I imagined it would be and so much more it is one of my favorite books
B00CL6GAD2|5.0|I may just be a sucker for crime thrillers but this one was an instant hit. At times you feel like you don't know what's going on or who's on what side but it all comes together in a satisfying way. Mark Warburg plays his part perfectly
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|A rousing score that tugs the emotional strings inside you.  I enjoy playing this while driving or listening this in the dedicated media room.  Love it.
B007G3H8Y0|5.0|Great music, songs. Train always comes through, enteraining. Great buy music for everyone in the family. Songs you can sing along to.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I like this game but it should have more villains not just two and they should be more evil more mean more villainy
B00BC24NT4|4.0|I was not bored with this but felt it was a bit contrived. I have read all of Le Carre. This is OK but not as good as Tonker,<br />tailor or other of his earlier books
B00AHQNHSY|4.0|Plays all formats! Player functions ok but could use some improvement. Have to search for material each time I wish to start the player.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I bought into the hype and received my fandangled dongle yesterday.<br /><br />Would've been a nice disclosure that Chromecast does not support iOS yet, so I'm basically no better off than if I just plugged an HDMI cable directly into my TV.<br /><br />Over-rated.
B005UDD1R6|4.0|Nice player wish it ran avi. Player functions are great.very easy to use and integrate with the kindle. If it played all formats would be my player of choice
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I would encourage anyone who is into the HBO series to read the books before, or even after they have watched it. It gives a lot more insight into the relationships and reasoning behind all of the backstabbing and daily lives of the characters, you also get much more history behind the entire story.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|My book club read this when it was released, but I never got around to it until recently. A number of people recommended it, so I picked it up again. It is a poignant narration from the perspective of a dog. It was so good, I immediately recommended it to my son who, also, loved it.
B00D7NWTSI|2.0|Ok. I won't give a point for point review as others have already done so eloquently and these comments will only make sense to anyone who has already seen the film.But for the most part this film was a big disappointing mess. Tony Stark dealing with post traumatic stress syndrome?? Most of his suits  of armor presented as so weak and brittle? (Note: one suit survived an entire war in The Avengers movie??).. Pepper Potts can freely jump into an Iron Man suit and know how to use it?.. That element reflected a total disconnect between the significant bond of Stark and his suit.\\"I am Iron Man.. The suit and I are one.\\" Apparently this is not the case if simply anyone can jump in the suit and be a bad ass. Iron Pepper saves Tony? - silly! And I don't believe that SHIELD would have allowed an attack on Stark's seaside residence. His home would have been under surveillance due to his statements regarding The Mandarin. And now Pepper has mutant powers?..Really?..  These are just a few of the asenine moments in this film.I'm hoping Iron Man 4 will clean up some of this silliness. I will probably get the 3D blu ray version just to have the trilogy. The tone of the film was just dry and uninteresting from the start. Of course It will be hard for Iron Man to follow his heroics performed in The Avengers,but this film just seemed aimless and uneventful. I'm getting a headache.. Maybe I'll add more later. I gave this film 2 stars out of respect to RDJ's performance. He truely has made this character his own.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|The kids are better at it than the adults and even though they think the dark forest is creepy, they enjoy the game heartily.
B00AYXNKIC|4.0|I would give this five stars but there is no replay button to watch your fails or successes. If there was a replay, hands down best gaming app.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey provides a very useful look at a period of major transition in the culture of England.  This transition is also reflected in the US and in other European countries.
B00AYR2FOI|3.0|The cd that rocks & I listen to it everyday is &#34; Boz Skaggs Greatest Hits Live&#34;. Excellent!! The band is unbelievable& his girls..:)
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is another great season of the Downton Abbey series.  The characters and their relationships are very beautifully crafted.  Wonderful!
B0089BSM70|5.0|Awesome work by Shout Factory!
1616551607|5.0|Amazing absolutely breath taking and the quote at the end omg at first i had my doubts about pre-ordering it and considered returning it a few times but now i dont this is one amazing book
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|The author's best book most undoubtedly. You feel what Afghanistan and the afghanis were going through and unfortunately are still going through in a very touching and personal way.
B00DSY8D36|2.0|Here is a quick summary below:<br /><br />Pro:<br />-Very fast pre-rendering of pages at a low-resolution<br />-Large thumbnail pages on the side bar for quick preview of pages before and after the current page<br /><br />Con:<br />-Problem displaying text boxes created by other PDF programs without re-adjusting the box size (when text border is being used)<br />-Problem displaying continuous fine lines when the page is zoomed out to show the larger extent of the page<br />-Problem locating the annotations correctly created by other PDF application such as EZ PDF.<br />-Lack the ability to adjust font size for typed notes.<br /><br />Device used to try the program: Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 (10 inch display with 1280x800 resolution)<br />Other full version PDF apps tried before: ezPDF reader, Office Suite, PDF to Go, Polaries Office, Quickoffice, Adobe PDF<br /><br />FULL REVIEW:<br /><br />I have tried many PDF apps before and the one thing I wished most of them have is the large thumbnail display of pages at the side bar like the popular desktop PDF programs such as Adobe PDF and Bluebeam. This features allows users to quickly look up information and have a better sense of where one is at within a chapter. Thus, I decided to give this app a try since I noticed it has the ability to display large thumbnail preview in the side bar.<br /><br />After playing the app for a while, I was disappointed. As listed above, this app has issue displaying text boxes created by other applications. If the box is not large enough it will not show any text inside at all unlike ALL other programs that I have tried. Another disturbing shortcoming is its inability to show fine lines without breaking. I have scanned images of books with tables and charts that appear to have missing borders when  zooming to show the full extent of the page. Worst of all, when loading file with large page size (30&#34; x 42&#34; drawing with vector lines generated by AutoCAD or Revit), the drawings becomealmost unreadable because I can barely see the lines when the page is zoomed out to show even just a quarter of the drawing. Another glaring problem is the inconsistency to display text and object created by other programs. In one instance, when opening a PDF file annotated by ez PDF, half of the texts and annotations are displayed at a completely wrong location. Finally, I did not find any property menu that allows a user to change the font size of the text annotation. The lack of this particular function forces me to cram large text on document with small page size. On the opposite hand, the single sized text annotation on documents with large page format becomes difficult to find.<br /><br />In short, those flaws make the program not the best choice for users who intent to make a lot of typed annotations and wish to open documents with diagrams, tables and graphics (such as textbook and technical documents). And it is a poor choice for those who would like to open large architectural or engineering drawings especially when the drawings were already annotated by other programs before. I will rather stick to other programs for now before those issues have been resolved by the developer.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|The game is good but I thought you could select different tile backgrounds.. :( But for free it is not bad.
B002SAUCBC|3.0|I read this book because I LOVED &#34;Cell&#34; by Stephen King.  The book somewhat held my interest, though it became a chore to read to the end.  The very unclear ending was just too general for me, though not open-ended.  I wish I had spent the money on something else, however, it was not a terrible read.
B0036FYO12|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. It doesn't age. All the suspense and thrills you'd want. Great Pick!<br />All you could want in a movie.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|This game is a fun time-killer, and is as creative as your own mind allows.  Unlock the extra levels for $1, as it makes the game a lot more fun!
B00006RCNJ|4.0|I am a fan of long standing and had missed this dvd.  I enjoy his music and the enthusiasm of his orchestra.  They truly do feel the music.
B005F3XV62|5.0|This really is a very enjoyable, funny movie to watch not only for Adults who enjoy wholesome movies, but for children also.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|I like the game.  Problem is now that I am at the end of all 4 levels, where can I go.  It is very challenging and entertaining, especially for me when I have to wait when reading a book is not an option.  Hopefully there are more levels for me to get and more games to play.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Really enjoyable movie and I like the title RED which meant, Retired, Extremely Dangerous. It is a fun, comedy, type of movie and I am looking forward to seeing the second one that is being released in the theaters this year, but wait till it comes out on DVD.
B008K8VDPU|2.0|Nothing special, just hit the keys around to get the piano sound.  My grand daughter plays with it, and that is about all she can do.
B005LAIISA|5.0|This movie continues with the theme of previous movies; some may find it dull, but for families with children it is most entertaining.<br />As an adult, I found it quite enjoyable to watch and the kids enjoy it also, especially one who is mentally handicap as the movie kept his attention.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|It did not help at all. Did not understand any of the information given.  I was not impressed and would not suggest it to anyone
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Fantastic and humbling inspiring story of an amazing human and determined Navy SEAL!  Would highly recommend, could not put it down from page 1.
B00382S9SC|5.0|it was a great way to start the season!!!!!!!! I had never seen the show before and I loved it!
B009QU9X44|5.0|I have read numerous books that deal with race issues but none gave me the insights that this one did. I found myself talking to everyone I knew about it and recounting stories from it, encouraging everyone to read it. However it is more than a book about race. It is a story about family love, romantic love, emigration, following dreams. I loved everything about it.
B001HBYHFA|5.0|I love the series, so Serenity was a must for me. I love this movie! It's in my top five! Packaging was good too and it arrived on time! I love buying from amazon!!
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|I loved Hosseini's previous books and hoped and hoped that this one would be as good as them and I am so pleased to say it exceeded my expectations. Like his other books this one deals mainly with the themes of love and loss but there is so much light to balance the dark that the book does not overpower you with sadness. He is truly one of the greatest living writers today.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Good game to pass the time and a real challenge.  Fun for all ages.  It is also great that it has several versions of the game as well.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This is a great app! It allows you to get into your tablet and delete folders, and other things you might not need. Be careful though with this app, cause if you're are not sure what you are getting rid of, you can actually make your tablet not function right.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This game by Gameloft is a great deal for such good quality as it is free, and what I really like about it is that the storyline is very detailed and easy to follow. Also, the characters are well rendered and there are many elements to the game that broaden the spectrum of the good parts of the experience, though, of course, like anything else, it still has room for improvement, because NOTHING is perfect, but don't get me wrong, things are treading at an infinitesimal (infinitely small) but ever-lasting speed to perfection, like this game and my optimism and maybe yours too, so do yourself a good favor and download this game and have fun!<br /><br />Good Luck And God Speed.
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|Yeah this really isn't a google app like I thought it was. It has a google look to it, but it doesn't work like google mobile does.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Awesome Series... Can't wait to start &#34;A Dance with Dragons&#34;!!!!!! Downloading is simple and accessible in seconds...love !!!! ! !
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I rate this five stars because it make you feel like Sherlock Holmes, the hints are readily available, storyline is great, and the clues are simple depending upon what you chose.
B00005R24K|1.0|the seller was wrong, sent me a different movie of \\"evil dead\\". First: it's only the movie, Second: no extras, no subtitles, no other audio tracks and third: the box looks like it was bought at Walmart.<br />Don't waste yor money on this product.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|An entertaining film; able to tie in German folklore and the deep Plantation South. Great performances by all. Would watch again.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game . It is very amusing. It very fun also. I think it is very cute and quite adorable. I think it is a great game and deserves a five star rating
B0012NO4WO|5.0|Sandra Bullock makes you believe that she is really driving that bus and Reeves makes the detective come alive. I love those two together.
B000J1AGQI|5.0|Great epic movie. Very realistic and gut wrenching.  Makes you very proud of our soldiers and how valiant they truly are!
B006P4FBUE|5.0|Mini Piano is nicely designed, easy to use and very amusing. I'm not a pianist but it's fun to play with.
030758836X|3.0|I really, really wanted to love this book, as I waited a LONG time for it. I'd considered many times getting my own copy, as the list was long at the library. Now I'm glad I waited!! For most of the story, I was kept entertained and immersed in the story. There is a LOT of Mars/Venus psychology wrapped in the dialog. I'd have recommended the book to my mother, who loves a good story but hates the \\"f\\" word and the other terms that writers descend to when faced with the need to express strong emotions without a good vocabulary to call upon. Glad I waited til the end of the book to make that recommendation, as well! Sadly, the author that had managed to keep the suspense going and the story twisting upon itself with a really smart female lead, let her down. Amy, who thought of everything, made basic, stupid mistakes that while revealing her weaknesses, also were not in keeping with the intellect displayed in the first parts of the story. For most of the character revelation, we get to know the side of two people that they don't reveal to the world, the side most of us have and keep to ourselves. That was masterful writing, contributing to a great story line. I have to wonder what happened to the author in there, though, as it seemed to fall back to contrived? The ending, quite frankly, sucked. I get it that it was supposed to make a point about the character of the characters but it failed miserably for me.<br /><br />I will, in the future, be hesitant to pick up another of this author's works.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|What a ride!  I have just finished be 3rd book of the Clifton series and can only say how thoroughly engrossed I was with this series. It is a fabulous and spectacular read that leaves me waiting with baited breath for his next installment.  Please Mr. Archer, Don`t keep us waiting long!!!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|i loved this movie  but you have to be a kid at heart.  Great family movie.  You cannot go wrong
B00C28J2VQ|5.0|I never got bored. This is how an action movie should be. This movie reminds me of the 1980s action movies with speed and adrenaline. I was tired, wanted to go to bed, 11pm and decided to watch just 15 minutes or so of the movie. You could see the movie was really hi-technology and the action non-stop, fast-paced, so I watched the entire movie till 1am. I can recommended GI Joei Retaliation highly as an action movie. James Bond type futuristic action.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|What do we really know about the way people and nature exist in the world?  How accurate are our memories?  Neil Gaiman pokes a sharp stick at these ideas in his tale of a young boy's terrifying struggle to survive an otherworldly nightmare filled with real danger.  This is gorgeous writing; I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys stepping out of the 'real world' now and then.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|Maybe not the ending I would've hoped for but overall still a fantastic read. Now to get ready for the movie.
B004JRVQX0|5.0|Great product FAST delivery, Great prices!<br /><br />This is a standard product for software anti piracy, you need it to run that latest software.
1885167776|2.0|Gary Keller is co-founder and chairman of the board of Keller Williams Realty International.  It is the largest real estate company in the United States.  He was an Ernst & young Entrepreneur of the Year.  Jay Papasan is Vice President at Keller Williams Realty.  They both live in Austin, Texas.<br /><br />This book would be in the category of self-help books for leaders but can have some implications for Board members.<br /><br />This is a book with one voice and two distinct sentiments. It would a better book if one of the sentiments had triumphed.  But the two sentiments make the total book less than the sum of its parts.<br /><br />There is a single voice throughout the book.  And that voice is charming, funny, and makes the reader feel like he is listening to stories told by a friend.<br /><br />But there are two sentiments.<br /><br />One sentiment has found a balance between education and entertainment.  This sentiment anchors key ideas in chapters with research and shows how the research could apply in business.  When this sentiment is in control, the book becomes a useful guide for leaders and for board members.<br /><br />For example, in Chapter 7, the authors tie several research studies to come up with the following perspectives.  None of these perspectives are novel but they are well presented: (1) viewing the mind like a computer is a dangerous analogy.  The mind is a muscle and needs to be treated like one.  In creating Board agendas, give plenty of breaks between agenda items to relax in the same way that you would allow for recovery periods between gym exercises.  (2) will power is like the power bar on your cell phone.  It can be recharged but it requires downtime.  It also needs to be managed.  The more we use our mind, the less minding power we have.  Therefore, set the most important Board agenda items at the beginning of the day and not at the end.  This is an interesting observation since the beginning of most Board meetings tend to be consumed by the routine (approval of minutes from last meeting; review of the financials) and the most critical issues might be placed on the agenda towards the end of the day.<br /><br />Chapter 5 links research to practical management of multitasking.  The authors say the brain does an excellent job multitasking autonomic and cognitive issues.  For example you can be<br />simultaneously reading this review and decide on your breathing rate.  The brain is designed for conscious/unconscious multi-tasking.  The brain is not designed to do an excellent job multitasking cognitive issues.  If you do two things at once, you will end up doing neither well.  This has implications for the management of meetings where members are not \\"called\\" out for reading emails during conversations.<br />The second sentiment is one where the balance between entertainment and education is tilted towards entertainment.  Presentation has taken priority over substance.<br /><br />This sentiment lacks evidence beyond personal vignettes.  It is based on the dubious premise that \\"I am successful using this perspective therefore you will be successful by copying me.\\"<br /><br />For example, the core theme of the book is \\"ONE.\\"  Find one thing and do it exceptionally well.  The authors quote Andrew Carnegie: \\"the concerns which fail are those which have scattered their capital, which means they have scattered their brains also.\\"  The \\"one\\" core question in this book is: \\"what's the one thing I can do such that by doing it, everything else will be easier or unnecessary?\\"<br /><br />The authors cite Mark Twain and Andrew Carnegie to justify the concept.  They fail to mention economist Adam Smith and strategist Michael Porter.  Each of them has articulated the same idea in a more effective manner.  The problem with the core idea of ONE is that it s old wine poured in an old bottle with an attractive new label.<br />In Chapter 12, the authors present a framework for asking \\"great questions.\\" They have fourtypes of questions based on two variables (Broad/Specific and Big/Small).  They recommend only one of them: Big Questions that are Specific.  For example: \\"what can I do to double sales in six months?\\" is Big and Specific.  Small Questions that are Broad rd would be \\"what can I do to increase sales?\\"<br /><br />This type of logic might make sense for a private company aggressively sales focused and operating in a growth environment where the CEO controls the Board.<br /><br />The authors fail to look at important contextual issues.  Would a CEO say the same thing to a private equity dominated board?  Would a public company make Broad/Specific statements and risk the Wall Street labeling the CEO \\"overpromise/underperform?\\"  Public company CEO and CEOs reporting to private equity Boards learn it is best to \\"under promise and over deliver.\\"  It is the role of the Board to push the CEO.<br /><br />Another contextual issue is leadership position.  Do you want the manager of a deep water oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico making Big/Specific commitments?<br /><br />In other words, this segment of the book is presented with a flair for the dramatic, a tendency to not base ideas on evidence beyond personal experience, and to assume \\"since it worked for me it will work for you.\\"<br />The core premise of the book is problematic for me.<br /><br />That premise is Define that One thing that is critical and Keep Your Eyes on it at all times.  This can work if you define that One thing as \\"Excellent Customer Experience.\\"  The Ritz Carlton does this and it works.  I have a client where we have defined the One thing as: \\"120/16.\\"  That is code for we will be a $120 Million company by 2016.  Everybody uses the slogan obsessively.  It is helpful to focus priorities.<br />Sometimes ONE makes sense.<br /><br />And sometimes ONE will create failure.<br /><br />But there is a reason why only 2% of automobile crashes in the United States are direct frontal hits and 25% of crashes are side collisions.  As the speed of the vehicle increases, driver peripheral vision erodes. As the speed of business increases, leaders' peripheral vision deteriorates as well.  For my company and with my clients, the greatest dangers and opportunities are not directly in one's line of vision but 45 degrees off the line of site.  In Chapter 1, the author talks about being so focused on his business problems, he could no longer see his problem with perspective.  He retained a coach and the coach helped him to understand that the core problem was at the peripheral of his vision.  When Apple came out with its new I phone, Blackberry did not see it as a competitive threat: Blackberry had a lock on the corporate mobile communications device market.  Apple, on the other hand, was a gadget company favored by teenagers and people in the creative arts.<br /><br />ONE may be the answer in some limited circumstances.  But it is not always the answer.  And it can be dangerous.<br /><br />The authors may agree. They authors may disagree.  But the failure to see the dangers in their reasoning makes this book more entertainment than practical.  My client companies keep their eyes on the ball and have people constantly watching 45 degrees from the ball much like a U.S. Army Ranger Patrol Squad has people looking straight ahead and people looking to the side.<br /><br />  ###<br /><br />Laurence J.

0525425772|5.0|Engaging story and characters.  Great read for young and old.  Doesn't write done for the kids, just includes context and definition for anyone who might need it.
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|Enjoyed this funny, genuine combination of R&J star-crossed romance and zombie flick. Fantastic quotes such as &#34;God, we move slow&#34; and &#34;They'll eat anything with a heartbeat. I mean, I will too, but at least I'm conflicted about it.&#34; Exhumed the swooning teen girl in me and kept me guessing until the end. Definitely worth your 90 minutes.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game Is so awsome and minions are so cute I love them and my mommy loves them to . Minions
159420411X|5.0|If you have an interest in statistics and predictions, this is an excellent book to address your interest.  The author covers a lot of ground, showing how relevant the statistical process is in many areas, such as weather forecasting, sports analysis, and economics.  Frankly, statistical surveys (and, worse, public opinion surveys) are frequently mischaracterized in the popular media, so it really pays to have an understanding of the limitations of statistical analysis.  You don't need an advanced degree (or even an undergraduate degree) to get a lot from this book.  That is saying a lot, since the author addresses a lot of fairly technical material in an understandable way.<br /><br />This is the book I have recommended the most in recent weeks.
B000FBJF7I|5.0|Very interesting learning about the culture  of other places.tears of the giraffe shows how other people think about life will read other books in this series..tears of the giraffe a no.1ladies detective...
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great twists and surprising ending. I couldn't put the book down. This book series gives the twilight saga healthy competition.
B008VVT51U|5.0|Warm and humorous, love the characters.<br />Planning a trip to India?  Watch this before you go for a taste of what cities are really like and a bit of insight into the culture.
B005PWPUW6|4.0|This thing works, the sound quality is not a &#34;blast&#34;, but, is enought for a home solution. You should consider other thing for professional use.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Very gripping period drama, draws you in and doesn't let go.  I didn't think I would like it but I looked forward to each episode.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The writing is fantastic. The acting is superb. The casting  is out of this world. I  love the clothes. I wish I were young because I would love to be home-schooled there.
B009NQZVKG|4.0|Mr. Rollins once again delivers.  And the addition of new characters  well done and Thank You.  The story took some non Sigma twists and turns and made this one even better
B003CI90MQ|4.0|Loved the book. If you want simple introductory instructions on how to improve from snapshots to real photographs, this is a good place to start.<br />Simple read, dry humor and very informative.<br />I would recommend this to anyone who wants to be more serious about their photography and need a place to start sinking knee deep into it.
B005LAIIRQ|4.0|The end credits must be watched to see the end of the story.  Suspenseful and keeps the attention of the viewer all the way through the movie.  Saw it originally in the movie theatre.  Bought this one as a gift.
B001P9EQH8|5.0|Very easy to use and does a super job with helping me enjoy music vidoes. I use &#34;ear muff&#34; type headphones to truly appreciate the increased bass feature. A great product---- wish I had purched it sooner.
B00BLYFDO2|5.0|and he brought the Stooges with him!  And it was well worth the trip and the wait.  This is another one you can add to your collection.  While you will probably never hear Iggy Pop (with or without the Stooges) on the radio (how sad is that?) nowadays, take it from me - these guys rock.  When compared to most of the stuff on the airwaves today, I just sigh and ask \\"what in the hell happened to rock?\\"
B00BSWMITK|4.0|Didn't seem to have anything that really leapt out like &#34;satch boogie&#34; or &#34;mystical potato head groove thing&#34;.  overall I liked it though.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|Couldn't put this down for the two days I played it! Cool retro graphics coupled with a really addictive puzzle aspect made this lots of fun!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|How much should I tip? What will the total savings be compared with the other store? Converting decimals to percentage. The list goes on and on.
B000EHSVSC|5.0|Enjoyed this version of the attack on Pearl Harbor.  Good to see both sides of the invasion.  Actual war footage a plus.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|If you love dystopian fiction, read this! Riveting, exciting, leaves you wanting more. Love the entire series, Suzanne is an excellent writer.
B008O9V4C2|5.0|Just super, super songs from a great artist.  How he can maintain the quality after all these years, to say nothing of the quantity, is amazing.<br /><br />If you have never listened to Donald Fagan, or have no idea who he is - then start with some Steely Dan then move to The Nightfly and then move to more of his later stuff.  By now, you will have become a fan.<br /><br />Sadly, you will never hear any of his songs on the radio nowadays.  If people would listen, then they would be fans too.  But Donald Fagan isn't peppy or cute and he probably can't do some of the moves that would make him visually successful.  What he does do is have great musicians playing great music and he writes his own songs and does his own lyrics.  Imagine that!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It is pretty cools I like Despicable Me the move so I had to try this one it is fun. My son absoutely loves the movie so had to get it to maybe excite him some.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|GREAT MOVIE THAT HAS ACTION A REAL PLOT AND BEST OF ALL IT DOESNT RELY ON FOUL LANGUAGE TO SELL YICKETS
B007N85POS|5.0|I got stuck playing this game for over an hour when I first installed the app. My granddaughter likes seeing the birds knock stuff down.
0596009208|5.0|I've purchased several Head First series books and this one, just like the others, does not disappoint!  The book was very easy to read unlike a lot of other books on the same subject matter. I'm about half way through at this point and actually get bummed when I have to put it down.
B00B4MUSHI|5.0|This album is just great! I wish the tracks were longer but it is what it is. I love playing these tracks while playing my other games!
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|After I got it it was loading I left to do something for a hour and it was at the same number 65%!
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This was a great read that I have highly recommended not only to other women in my life, but also to many men - including my incredibly supportive husband and my male boss who is a great champion of women in our workplace.  I have read criticism of the book that indicates it does not apply to all women - that is true, but it is in no way targeted only at the rich and privileged.  This book will resonate with women that have choices in their career and this personal life.<br /><br />This book is very straightforward and inspirational at once.  As a working mother who is successful in male dominated industry, I relate to many of the things Sandberg cites as common pitfalls women are choosing to fall into without realizing it.  This is a great read and I highly recommend it!
B0097EWK3A|4.0|I purchased the app based on the free portion and was satisfied with what I got. Am looking forward to seeing if there will be a second game in this series.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I can keep up with my friends and family that are spread across the country.  I have young granddaughters that live several states away. Without FB I would have missed out on some great moments.
B004Y5AV4M|5.0|I've been reading Regency romances for years. Georgette Heyer is probably the foundress of modern Regency romances. This is pure escapism, into lovely upper class  locations, with proper romance, lovely clothes, and sparkling conversations. Not for those with an egalitarian mind set; difficult to really overlook the proportion of servants to upstairs occupants. But, it is easy to follow and enjoy these stories.<br /><br />I am rerading it this sumer, thank Heaven for Kindle and its large size font. Typical charming rogue hero, headstrong heroine, ahappy ending. Her books are in the top tier of Regeny romances.
B00CRWJ7VC|1.0|It is the first time we &#34;streamed&#34; a movie.  It did not have closed caption, and this movie has a lot of dialog and flipping from one time to another.  Without closed caption, it was impossible to follow so we finally turned it off.
B00DGNO3WE|3.0|The cast is amazing. Real vintage musicians but the story is slow and contrived. Not the Maggie Smith we usually see.  I'm not sorry I watched it but I was disappointed.<br />I do say that the quality of sound and picture on Amazon has been great.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved the action and romance. Just enough violence to keep you on the edge of your seat coated with the love triangle.
B0063IH60K|4.0|sometimes you just want to see how the odds play out. this is a good game to play on a sunday afternoon
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I am about to try the experiments but after reading once through, I can say that the content itself is interesting and thought provoking.  This author writes the way I talk so it is easy to read and get the points that are being made.  When reading about a subject that can be complicated to explain in writing, it's nice when it is not written in a pretentious way but rather straight and to the point, no BS.  This lets you quickly retain what you are reading and makes you feel like you didn't buy a book full of filler words to bump up the page count.  I also felt that this book supports my belief that all cultures are on the same basic page in their beliefs but describe them differently so they disagree with each other, when we all need to take off the judgement glasses and see things for what they are.  Open your mind and let this book in.  I am seeing the same things in a new way and motivated to try the experiments.
B004I654WQ|5.0|Do not know since it was a gift. I'm assuming it was good since it was a requested gift for a child.
B009IJJ712|5.0|I put off watching this series because, quite frankly, I thought I would hate it. I wasn't a big Lucy Liu fan and wasn't interested in watching a show I thought wouldn't last past the first season. THANKFULLY friends persisted and I marathon-watched and caught up before the finale. Fantastic show with great chemistry within the entire cast, believable (yet familiar) characters, and to top it off, it's beautifully shot and scored..it's worth it. Watch it.
B00DBSZJRM|1.0|This could have been a very good movie if it were not for the profanity. Right off the top the F bomb was dropped. I don't understand why producers feel they have to assault people with profanity. It did not do anything for the movie except make me want to turn it off, which I did. I wonder how much more money they could have made but dropping the profanity and making it more people friendly.
141694737X|5.0|My daughter loves this book. She enjoys lifting the flaps and listening to Mommy make all the different animal noises. She especially loves the puppy at the end, and will spend a couple minutes &#34;petting&#34; it and giving it kisses. Big thumbs up.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love having the Bible on my Kindle. It's so much lighter to carry around this way. It is always at my finger-tips.
B00000JXZ7|5.0|This 1972 recording of the Bruch violin concerto and Scottish Fantasia was one of the first discs to be issued by Decca featuring their new violin discovery and followed on from her phenomenally successful disc of the Tchaikovsky and Sibelius concertos. The coupling was a daring combination as the fantasia was relatively unknown and the concerto was normally coupled with the Mendelssohn concerto. For this reissue, the later Mendelssohn recording from 1981 is included. This too, was very successful and was one of the fruits of her later partnership with Dutoit.<br /><br />This remastered disc has all the advantages of the latest remastering technology and is an improvement over previous CD issues which were compromised by the relatively limited sonic range available at that time. What we have here is a clear upgrade back and beyond to the levels achieved with top end LP players and this provides far greater 'presence', a deeper sound-stage and greater tonal depth.<br /><br />The performances are classics of their time and are still to be preferred to most of the more recent issues. This is because of the personality of the young soloist who was able to communicate the sheer joy and spontaneity of her music making to a remarkable extent. This suits the Mendelssohn very well and the more romantic nature of the Bruch works is delivered with passionate simplicity. At all points there is no doubt of her virtuosity but this is never a focus of her playing. The nearest more recent player that comes to mind in these ways is the equally gifted and delightful Sarah Chang.<br /><br />These are genuinely legendary recordings that fully justify the title of 'Legends' and the remastering processes involved. They deserve to be considered with the very best for purchasing purposes.
B00CEJ2H6K|5.0|Amon Amarth at their best !!!<br />This one the best metal albums of 2013<br />Amon Amarth rules keep it guys!!<br />See you on the next US TOUR
B00C8985DU|5.0|This would have to be the best presented collection of a rock and roll tour, it has all the documents and photos that would never have been seen by the public, also the enclosed &#34;Rockshow&#34; and &#34;Wings over the World&#34; DVDs which have been digitised for this release are fantastic.<br />I love the complete package as I was part of the tour as the documentary film cameraman and it brings back all the memories of  a fantastic tour with a great group of people, what a great production.
B00BUADSMQ|5.0|My brother and I love this movie a lot. We own every single Die Hard movie and can't wait for the next one. You guys should get this movie and the others if u don't have them yet.
0689835604|5.0|My daughter loves this book. I can't tell you how many times I've had to read and re-read and re-read this book during bedtime. It's been helpful in teaching her names of body parts too.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|I love being able to see videos of my granddaughters in real time, and our family in other parts of the country can see what's going on aroung here in real time.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Although I immensely enjoyed the book, the section I thought I would enjoy most - life at SNL and working with her Sarah Palin character - was the slowest part of the book. That quibble aside, other sections had me laughing out loud and engaged fully with the text. A great book to take a break from fiction!
B00506NRBS|5.0|Short read about the goal setting and simplistic approach to detail. Enjoyed how things were looked at from a not so typical business book perspective. Great book!
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I have this on my Kindle Fire.  The weather it reports is close, but not spot on.  Whenever I am away on vacation, it seems to tell me the weather at home is not what it really is when I call home to check on things.  Oh well, I guess close enough is supposed to be good enough.
B0015HOFZI|2.0|I had owned a Sony PS-LX300USB Turntable previously.  It unfortunately broke (my fault).  I purchased a new one and it did not record at the same levels as the original.  I sent feedback to Sony and they responded with things to do to fix it, but they did not work.  I returned the product.
B001QEFYAK|3.0|They changed the soundtrack for some reason and it is pretty awful.  It simply doesn't fit properly.  I think they gave the task to an intern who hates cult horror films, because they did a terrible job.  Still the same, the movie is unchanged and just as good as it ever was.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is a great way to network with people all over the country and the world. Sharing pictures and links of things that interest you.
B00D6BU8GG|3.0|I think it's time for this series to end. I don't believe there is any more to say about John Mclane.
B005LAIGNC|5.0|I applaud George Lucas for his fresh new and exciting take on such a historical event. i enjoyed taking my daughter to experience something she could be proud of.  I think the real pilots felt pretty much how i felt. Awesome! And i cant even fly a fighter jet let alone dog fight in one. Hats off men.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Before I had MC I was sad because I watched so many people play it on YouTube and kids from my school had it.Then I found it!It is a wonderful game where you can fight mobs build anything you can think of and of course mine.I love it and so would you.Even though it costs money it's worth every cent.Buy it now!
074401493X|5.0|Strategy guide was very helpful with finding all the items within the game!!  Detailed and organized perfectly.  Also, the keychain was much nicer than I expected.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The story lines and the characters kept me riveted the entire season!  The only thing that disappoints me is that the next season doesn't start till January!
B009WUAK2M|5.0|The Expendables 2 was a very action-packed movie with all of the old action movie stars in it.  Enjoyed it!
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|Just fun to watch these superstars play archetypal action heroes. I've seen it several times to have a light, relaxing hour or so.
B00992CF6W|4.0|i love this game in creative i made a rocket in creative and in survival i found DIAMONDS so that is why you should get this game.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I Love the features it is so simple my 5 year old looks it up so she will know what to wear to school.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app but the realms does not work yet but it is great app. But it's a little bit behind the pc update.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I could not put this book down. I read it almost nonstop. So well written. Surprise ending. I'd highly recommend this book and this author. Nothin negative to say about this book!
B007STBUIW|5.0|Any JAWS fan would love to have this movie on blue ray.  There are added scenes and bonus footage that was not shown in the original film.  I loved this movie!
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|This music is great. I had to order the music because watching her dance on YouTube was way too distracting (she has a great smile), but otherwise, this music is fantastic for focusing on one's work.
B005IGDW24|5.0|This is a cute movie and the 3D effects are excellent.  My family and I have already watched it 3 times since I bought it.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Great book. Definitely the best I've read this year. Highly recommend! Cant wait for his next book to come out.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My daughter loves this app.  And I love the fact that I don't have to buy a real horse...at least for now.
B00CHMBQ0C|3.0|A solid action flick.  Aaron Eckhart is a good actor who elevates the material. The plot is standard ex-spy betrayed, on the run storyline but its enjoyable.  The daughter is annoying at times and SPOILER of course she disappears at the worst time to get herself snatched and then dad to the rescue. Cliches all around but it's worth the rental thanks to solid action and good acting.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|I wish I knew if the coins to play add up over time or if you only get them on the scratchers and level ups...I'm not going to pay money to keep playing more than a couple times a day...
B008A36R2Y|5.0|This is an Arduino Board with a really pristine look. Plus, it is nice that they are using the USB micro, because just about everyone has one of those cords for their phone nowadays.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I love this book. I have read it three times and will probably read it a million more. John Green is so talented and I look forward to more of his books. This one is a real tear jerker, especially for someone who has lost a loved one to cancer, like me. I would recommend this book to anyone with the ability to read. Don't let the sadness of the whole picture take away your chance to get to know some truly beautiful and humorous characters.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|this game sucks its a waist of time good thing that lame thing is free i can't even open this lame game god all mightyq will somone please get this off the list sheesh just don't waist your time free or not it sucks
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This book is very interesting. I found it supercaliflagelisticopodicius. Well I am looking forward for the best book from you.
B005LAII80|5.0|Let me just say I'm not a comic book fan and I decided to watch this movie because I'm a Karl Urban fan.  I have seen the dreadful Stallone previous version.  I enjoyed this movie so much! Beautiful cinematography and non-stop action.  The villain was excellent, and the storyline flowed nicely.  My only complaint as an Urban fan was he never took off his helmet although I do know this is true to the storyline comics.  I would love a sequel!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game its really fun and I think I would play it everyday for something too do the kids love it
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Somehow a page-turner, insightful, and intellectually stimulating all at once. One of the best books I've read in a long time.
0553801473|5.0|The book shipped quickly, although there were a few dusty fingerprints on a few of the pages when I received the book. :/.  Otherwise it is a great read and well worth the money if you want a book with twists and turns, and a well developed political system.
B0001XAPY2|5.0|Breathtaking animation, memorable characters, fun, exciting!  Our family loved it!  We have rented this movie many times and finally decided to buy it.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|A good conclusion to a very good book and series I'll certainly read again before too long. It doesn't disappoint.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I loved the characters and how the plot is folded together. The imagery is absolutely phenomenal. I can't wait to see what else this author has written.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|If you played Angry Birds, it's nothing really new.  Same game, different details.  Enjoying it though. Nothing more to say.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|i love it it is very addictjng i mean i stay up till at least 12 at night playing the best game this is also mynhorse
B00CWY76CC|5.0|. Great game. Fun to play with the kids. Cool levels and puzzles.  Best game I have found in a long time.
B00BNGFGIQ|4.0|It's quite entertaining and keeps you guessing just how to keep him moving through the trees.  Fun to play, and can be challenging at times.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|If you wonder if this book can be as good as his first two.... It is. I could not stop. You will fall in love with the characters and grieve when it ends.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I can't set the device up.  I have an iphone, ipad and a desktop that's hard wired into my router.  iOS setup of this device is not supported at this time.  My desktop can't see the chromecast for setup since it doesn't have wifi.  This device is a very nice paper weight until they add iOS setup or I purchase a wifi card for my desktop just so I can set it up.<br />A bigger disclaimer would have been nice.  If someone knows how to get this working with my setup I'd gladly change my review.<br />________<br /><br />Update: I had a friend come over with a laptop and we were able to set it up pretty easily.  Still irks me a bit.  It's everything everyone says it is (really cool).  I couple minor issues though.  When streaming a tab from my PC it seems to cut off a half inch of the screen all the way around.  As in, I can't see the edge of the content on my TV that I can see on my desktop.  I've tried both steaming my entire desktop and streaming a tab in chrome, same result.  A workaround I've found is instead of going full screen with video to just zoom in like crazy with the browser so there is still a border around the video.  That way on various esport or regular sport streams you don't have the score cut off, since that's normally on the edge of the screen.<br />Updating my review from 2 stars to 4.  I'd give it a 3.5 based on my setup experience and the wonky things I have to do to get the screen not to be cut off.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very similar to the idea of Temple Run.  It has locked up on me a couple time, however.  Still enjoying it though.
B00CGNYDIE|5.0|These are bright and colorful, and logic puzzles to boot! If you like logic puzzles, you'll love Hex Logic puzzles.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I love playing this game on Facebook and I love it even more on my phone wonderful app!!! would recommend to everyone
B00BNZN27E|5.0|Toscanini and Furtwangler are often said to be the two greatest conductors of the last century. If they were boats, Toscanini would be the speedboat. He's a thrill ride that one tends to tire of after a relatively short time. Furtwangler would be a powerful ocean-liner. He's grandiose and overwhelming. I love both kinds of boats and have traveled often on both. But the kind of boat I enjoy the most and never tire of is the sail boat. It brings one closest to the real world where you go as fast or slow as the wind and water allow. Bruno Walter is the sail boat of conductors. Listening to him has brought me the greatest pleasure over the long run because he evokes the poetic soul of the score. Everything seems in perfect balance and in accord with the composer's intent. The sound quality of the stereo recordings in this box is excellent. Not all of Walters best recordings are here,but that doesn't diminish what is included. The must haves that are not here are the stereo Mozart symphonies and ,perhaps most compelling, Walter's recordings of Mozart operas and Fidelio from the Met and elsewhere. These are the most perfect performances of any operas I have ever experienced and that includes many hundreds. Some of them are only available on British Amazon. I have acquired a number of the big boxes featuring conductors,including Bernstein, Toscanini and Furtwangler. I consider Bruno Walter:the Edition to be the most musically fulfilling.
0452289963|5.0|If there's one book you'll read your entire life, this would be it. So inspiring. I try to apply to my everyday life.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|Have been wanting the original in blu ray format. Would I buy it? Absolutely. So would countless others. Please release this in the intact original version so many of us know and cherish!
B005TKD8ZK|5.0|Once you appreciate the style of this book, the insights are huge. Life as an application of consistent focus - and running as an example where you race yourself for no real prize.
B009NQZVKG|4.0|This is entertaining, even if it's a bit far-fetched. It's a quick and easy read<br />with enough thought-provoking theory to balance the adventure film type of action.<br />I cared about  two of the character, in the end.  Which ones will you care about?
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I like the game. It can be a little challenging,but it is very fun. It really makes you think. Level 4 is kind of tricky,but I made it out.
B00DFRVAC2|5.0|Good accompaniment to exercise, writing, or whatever challenging things you do. It's as great as the movie itself (which you should see, if you haven't).
B004J4XGN6|3.0|The basic ideas in this  book are  thought provoking and well worth reading.  My criticism is that at half the length those ideas could have been presented and fully  fleshed out. The rest is padding.
B00DBSZEH2|1.0|The story is weak and all the scenes look like they were filmed on a sound stage.  Was Jim Henson involved?
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is amazing tunnels ziplinrs skeleton monkeys!  I love it!!!!!!<br />if you want this game get it! I just got it yesterday and I love it!!! so exciting!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I purchased this app a while back for a better more relaxing sleep. But now I have really been using it, and find it truly relaxing. I love how you can create your own melody, and how you can listen to it for hours. It really lessens tension and stress. And it's free, so that's a plus. There's tons of different sounds to listen to and mix, some are really creative! I'd recommend this app to everyone.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|this is an awesome game I &quot;killed&quot; everyone with a virus kind of disturbing but over all it's an awesome game totally worth the money highly recommended
B00821OX98|5.0|I just found out about this show. I'm hooked! I highly recommend this show. It's quite Alien (Pun intended)!!! Wonderful!
B00013M6NK|5.0|I was a little nervous about ordering this as a back-up battery, thought that maybe it wouldn't work as well (last as long, etc.). But I was pleasantly surprised that it is EXACTLY the same as my original battery that came with my camera. It works perfectly. It shipped super quickly, also, so that was awesome. Love it.
B005PK57IK|5.0|Great season.  The show is fast streaming and has great video and audio quality. My husband and i love this show!
B0018QOIXU|4.0|I like the artist's voice, so to add to my musical collection this was a must have.  While I realize that songs are a matter of personal choice, I do love Adele's voice.
B00DP3IGJ6|1.0|I have Prime so I don't have to pay for movies all the time, I hate when I receive these advertisements and I can't watch it.
B006N0YWGY|4.0|Fun game, not terribly difficult but it takes some practice to become proficient. After playing for a while, you realize that the speed is a benefit and you get used to how the fan boat handles. Great app.
B006S01GH2|4.0|I remember liking this movie mainly for the pleasure of looking at Audrey Tautor. It has been a while so do not remember enough details to elaborate on the story or how well it was done. But it is worth watching so's to spend time with Ms.? Tautor.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I do not like the way the app was changed in July.  It was much better before!<br /><br />This new upgrade is terrible!  I much prefer the app before it was changed.
B00DP3IGJ6|4.0|Enjoyed the story, kept me intrigued. Although I disagree with the premise that there is no separation from the man's soul and the brain. There was no sense of loss since jack was a mere clone and there were several more of him around.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|This was a gotta have CD for anyone who is into the music, the voice, and the lyrics.  I found this to be a better CD than 19 but that is my personal choice base upon my musical likes. A must have for anyone's collection.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Can't wait to finish season 3 and for season 4 to start on PBS. Working on finishing season 3 right now.
B003JUGQ38|4.0|Took me a while to warm up to the character of Donna Noble. She was too obnoxious at the beginning, but as the season went on her character blossomed into something much more. I mean she saved the universe after all. Great storyline throughout the season. &#34;The Sontaran Stratagem&#34; 2 part episode was fantastic, &#34;Silence in the Library&#34; was some really clever writing and &#34;Turn Left&#34; were my favorites. The season was a great send off for David Tennant's &#34;The Doctor&#34;!
0307352145|2.0|I think the subject matter for this book could have easily been contained within a pamphlet. Much too drawn out for me. Plus it appears the author tends to lean left, with her celebrity examples i.e. algore. For whom I have no use.<br /><br />As I sit here alone, but not lonely, writing this, the book sits on my bed stand 2/3rds unfinished. As it will remain. No, I will put it away.<br /><br />To be fair, at my age (66) I have little to learn with regard to this topic that could be applied to my life as I live it today. Nor little to learn that I don't already know about my own joyous, peaceful and serene introverted splendor.<br /><br />I think I should add that outside the walls of my home I have for most of my life presented like an extrovert. I felt forced, if you will, for my entire life to behave like an extrovert. I have never been slow to state my opinions and thoughts on any subject when I felt they were called for. Most people who know me would not describe me as a &#34;quiet and thoughtful&#34; person.  Yet, there is no place that I long more to be than alone and at home.  Thank God for retirement.<br /><br />Update: I had to go 14 pages in to find my review, posted at the end of July. Judging from all the mostly positive reviews that this book has received since that time and overall (1,483), I'd say the author has made a bundle off of it. To which I can only reply, kudos to you Ms. Cain. Hmmmmm, If I only had the inclination...
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|It was awesome I love this book and highly recommend it to everyone earnest cline is the best I can't wait for him to write another book
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This was a great series!  I was surprised at the twists along the way.  The only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is because I wanted the story to go on!
B005GSY23M|5.0|This is a fantastic soundtrack.  Just great music all around.  Much of the soundtrack plays like a dream sequence, which kind of follows the movie which felt more like a dream than reality.  Martinez captured the essence of the film well, but you don't have to have seen the film (or even liked it if you had) to appreciate the soundtrack.
B004GQLJTA|5.0|I gave 5 stars! But i was expecting my digital copy number! To be 100% happy, Thank you any way!
B00005QGAX|5.0|They Don't call King of POP for no reason. More like King of music. I might be a little bias because I love this man. very good album.
B00B8BR6CU|3.0|I like the time period for which the movie was made. A good job was done, I feel, in creating the essence of life during that time. The movie had a decent story and some humor to help carry it along. Interesting to see Ben Afleck and some others from 13 yrs past. Entertaining enough but not to spend time talking over the water cooler.
B004GCPJDQ|1.0|I used it for about 3 days after which I could no longer deal with it. When moving the mouse the battery pack loses its connection to the mouse. As a result the bluetooth signal gets lost and it takes 15-20s to reconnect. Extremely annoying, so I moved it to the drawer of shame.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|So ready for some more levels!  Was just challenging enough to drive you crazy and celebrate when you solved it!  Thanks!
B0064NTZJO|4.0|Don't expect this to be what it's not and you'll enjoy it.  This is one of the rare films where both the praise and scorn are equally true.  For those who \\"get it\\", I \\"get it\\" --- for those that don't, I get that too.  I almost hated this movie, but then I ended up loving it.  Yes, sounds contradictory but those who have seen this and like it know what I am talking about.<br /><br />Anyway, Gosling is a young goose.
B00005BKZJ|4.0|It went awhile with nothing, but I hung in there and it turned out to be a very good movie. How one person can help so many just because of her loving life.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|THIS IS ONE &#34;THE BEST&#34; YOU WILL FIND TO EXPERIENCE<br />THE WIDE RANGE OF EMOTIONS FROM YOUNG TO MATURE<br />LOVE...  EVERYONE MUST SEE...  I BOUGHT THIS ADDED<br />COPY BECAUSE OF LOANING OUT SOOO MUCH TO FRIENDS<br />AND FAMILY ...  A TREASURE OF A MOVE...
B004Q3NBXU|5.0|A great movie, beautifully directed. Wonderful images, fast paced action...powerful movie.  Best movie I have seen in quite a while.
B009M2T7K6|4.0|This is a nice little toy for any girl, my daughter love it a lot. The hair changes color in cold water and the of this doll is also a good size.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|This was A really good book and I'm not a zombie person.  It kept me interested from cover to cover.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I'm so happy with the ending! I love Sookie and am sad this is the end. This book was  so good I couldn't put it down.I read it all in one night. Charlaine Harris, you did it again!
B0061PEAUY|5.0|Love the characters....interesting people and places...The Temperance Brennan novels are great....they don't dissapoint.  Kathy Reichs has continued to develop these characters year after year.
B009NY43NY|3.0|I was happy to reconnect with familiar old characters, and I must say I was happy the ending was not what I feared.  The book is pretty much like most in the series with a few surprises, but if I had read this one first, I would never have read the series......
034580404X|5.0|The trilogy was much more than what i expected. I took the books with me Europe to read during my down time and I finished all 3 in a week!!!! Simply amazing and never a dull moment....I want more Christian Grey!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This is an awesome book if read with an open mind.  True love love conquers all and patience. The trilogy totally kept me biting my nails.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|This is better than a pizza ninja because you  an get different blades and you slice quicker get this one instead!
B00DGMVJAO|2.0|Milk-toast production. Not the least believable even with the exaggerated effects. Unless you are below the age of 13, don't bother.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|Amazing image quality just as you'd expect. It's great to have these films on such a high quality medium but fans are still begging for the original version in a hd format!
1781162646|5.0|What's not to love?  It's Stephen King and it's a crime story.  There is mystery, romance, scary and being a good person.  All good elements for a book and Stephen delivers as he always does.
0345529057|5.0|I love the Song of Fire and Ice series, not a big reader in general, but for these ones I could be. They don't leave you feeling like things are ever too drawn out or boring, I have found that George R. R. Martin knows how to keep things interesting and moving at a great pace. I got the books because I love the show and everyone has kept saying how much better the books are even with the show being so great. It's pretty rare fans of a book are also fans of a show or movie of that book, so I had to check it out. I guess being able to get some of the details, background story and character thoughts into the show are harder, that's probably what really makes the books stand apart from the show.. You can actually read what characters are thinking at times, get more back story about characters and how things went down in the past, and get more detail about their surroundings from the books. Definitely I would say this is a must buy if you are into the Game of Thrones show, the books will only make you love the series more.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I have been reading A LOT of books lately and have read some really good ones, but this book was just amazing.  It took turns and twists that for the most part, I did not expect.  I was so engrossed in the book that my son kept trying to take my Kindle from me - lol!  (and I don't mean 'lots of love' ha - you'll get it after you read the book.<br /><br />Buy the book, read it and you will love it.
0345803485|1.0|I read this book cover to cover. There are several issues I had with this book. First of all, the repetition is annoying. Really annoying. I can't imagine how many times the main character says \\"oh my\\". Its pretty much on every other page. Next, its unrealistic. The main character has not only not had sex, but she's never had an orgasm, and acts completely oblivious to anything that has to do with sex...which brings me to the sex...there's way too much of it. If your looking for a good romance, this isn't it. The book is basically a porn minus the romance. Sorry, but I didn't feel it. Way too much sex in this book for my liking and not enough love story. The main character is basically a love slave to this man. I actually find it offensive that a man thinks its ok to treat a woman like this. She has no say in anything even down to the clothes she wears around him and how much sleep she has to get to her diet. Let me say, this book had me bored to death several times. It is supposed to be a quick and easy read, however it took me over two months to read it as I kept getting bored and found better things to do. Eventually, I finished it. Finally, I want to say that if your looking for anything to actually happen in this book, there really is not plot. There is no murder, no real drama, just two people who meet and have sex most of the book. The ending was slightly surprising, and unexpected, but not enough to make me want to read the second book in the series. I am really kicking myself for buying the trilogy rather than just the first book as I don't think I will ever read the other two and wasted my money. Don't buy this book!
B00BXVKKPA|5.0|This bands sound takes you back to the 80's-90's when rock music was cool guitar riffs /drum licks and screaming vocals. I wish more bands would bring this sound back again
1476733953|5.0|I thought long and hard before typing that subject line, mostly to make sure I actually meant it and wasn't just speaking in hyperbole. Turns out I really meant it. I cannot accurately describe the joy (and tension, and fear, and sadness, and excitement) I experienced while reading this novel. I was convinced somewhere along the way that something about the book would bother me, and as I neared the end I was convinced the story couldn't be adequately wrapped up in the few remaining pages. Shows what I know. Not since Harry Potter have I been so addicted to a series, and not since Tolkien has such an amazing world-builder existed. Hugh Howey has created a literary universe unlike any other and has made it seem effortless (unless you read his blog, in which case you know the truth). No lie, when I turned the last page I wanted to give the book a hug, that's how enamored I was with the astounding tale I'd just finished reading. If you've not yet read 'Wool,' stop reading this review, pick it up, and enjoy. And then read 'Shift.' And 'Dust.' And the 'Wool' fan fiction. And thank Hugh for giving us such an amazing story to read.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|you must get this game. And it is free. if you like temple run, subway suffers, and dispicable me then you will love this game.
B009R5GR1K|4.0|A very user-friendly interface. It allow you to quickly browse through different options without losing the initial query. I would love a pronunciation option but it is  a suggestion. All in count, it is a great value for th  price.
B0090X4GLW|4.0|...and loved the music. I was sure to no like it but was I wrong. It is something that I will not forget and I enjoy humming the music...you will too.
B00CLZ48FA|5.0|I enjoyed this movie. Especially because they stayed true to the original movie we all grew up with and I can't wait for the next &#34;episode&#34;. We have to find out where the ruby slippers came from, don't we???
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|It is not worth the time or the money.  But then again, if you like cheap porn - it;s for you.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Fun read.  I liked the movie the hunger games and the story continues.  Good distraction for the dog days of summer. the viewers of the hunger games remind me of the viewers of reality tv.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Looking forward to the tv series. Very thought provoking.  Interesting way to look at the way the prison system work's.
B00AREIAI8|2.0|Orginaly had given this game 4 starts because it was great fun. The horse has very life like movements,fun to do horse training and taking care of the horse.  THE BAD bad is it too hard to earn gems.<br />NOW I've lowered it to 2 Stars because this game loves to freeze or crashed my Kindle fire HD. MORE BAD is now that I have reached level 10 every time I finish a task in the game I am reward with an ad for another game.  This is very annoying and I have stopped playing.  I wish the makers of this game had a version that you could purchase without all the freakin' ads! ANNOYING AS HECK FIRE
B000002KHH|4.0|As I get older, I will never regret getting into Sabbath. I have a real appreciation for their music and style. It's not for everyone, but I enjoy it.
B001UV4XHY|4.0|Okay, I'm a big Harry Potter fan!  (I weigh around 210 lbs).  This movie was a little disappointing for me though.  Not that I didn't like the Deathly Hallows, but just because this movie is such a big build up to... waiting for the next movie.  Not necessarily the director's fault.  The first half of the book was slow as well.  Still a good movie though.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Liked it so much - what a plot - that I ordered the other two and I'll bet after those I will probably buy anything else this author has written..  Great read!!  Couldn't put it down.
B0047Y17P2|4.0|I enjoy the Lincoln Lawyer novels, and this was no exception.  Although the focus moved from the Lincoln to an office, the storyline dealt with some topical issues and Connelly kept the action moving.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I loved this game so much that I bought the extra packages to play. I only wish they'd make more because I've now gitten a perfect score on all games!
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|As soon as I saw Google released this item and it costs $11 after Netflix code, I didn't think twice to buy it.<br /><br />Got my Chromecast yesterday and hooked it up with my TV really easy setup. It works with most of the websites I watch streaming videos. I noticed at few instances there was a slight delay in video between laptop and TV. I noticed videos got stuck at few instances and it adjusted by itself after few seconds, think my wi-fi connection drop.<br /><br />Before Chromecast I used to connect my laptop using HDMI cable which wasn't long enough to bring laptop to couch and ugly cable hanging out of my TV. Now this reduced cable clutter and solves my issue with just $11, no one can beat that price factor.<br /><br />Five stars for the price, usability and does what I expect it to do.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|If you are looking for conventional you won't find it here. However, if you are looking for honest, naked, pure, raw truth... Welcome. This book looks at life from a practical perspective on how to push through inevitable failure to personal accomplishment. Amazing. I would write more here, but I'm going to start reading it again. You should too.
B00005JMAH|4.0|Although I am a big Harry Potter fan, I never really got into the Prisoner of Azkaban as much as I did into the other movies.  But its still a good movie.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Anyone that has children would relate to this book.  What if??  Keeps you guessing right till the end.  Great read.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I like being able to get a quick snapshot of my favorite locations. The weather channel app provides a great way to get a complete picture. Easy to use.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game . Super fun works well on kindle. My four year old and I are both addicted to it.
B00BWJ7LYG|1.0|Apparently an HD monitor and fast connection are not enough to watch an HD video. You need to have an 'approved' device like a tablet or console. Good work, Amazon.
B0023SDPS6|4.0|I was looking for a mystery series to read through the summer, and Craig Johnson's first Longmire book was highly entertaining. The plot was well crafted and the characters were excellently developed. I will definitely be continuing on with Craig Johnson's series.
0123694965|5.0|I'm an amateur game designer, and I love this book!  Schell does an amazing job of helping game designers ask the questions that they need to ask in order to design good games!  But that's not all!  This book is also a very, very fun read!  And I believe that it would be beneficial for just about anyone trying to create an entertainment-based product to read this book!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This game is addicting. I find myself going to this app over and over. And the variations prevent it from being boring
B00DU73T08|3.0|Saoirse Ronan did an excellent job of playing two characters that grow together and becomes friences, but she always does better being intense, assertive, and powerful than at the passion needed to draw the audience into what is directed and written as a love story. In all fairness, the book is much the same - internal and private, with the passion and love scattered intermittently in flashbacks.
B000WC3A0S|5.0|best price beutiful  clear pitchure these dvds are now in our family for life im glad i found them on your site
B0007LGCB8|5.0|I bought my first pair of Newports before taking my family to Disneyworld. Told the salesperson at Gander Mountain I needed a sandal I could walk in all day and not have sore feet at the end of the day. I suffer from plantar fascitis and also needed good arch support. He promised me that if these weren't the most comfortable sandals/shoes i ever owned after my trip he'd give me my money back. 3 years later i just bought my 2nd pair. I wear these everywhere. ..ball games, hikes, in the river etc. and they never fail. Bought from Amazon this time and saved 30 bucks plus free shipping. Will continue to buy these sandals as long as they keep making them.
030758836X|2.0|No likable characters and nothing to learn from this read.  Outlandish in some respects.  No character who is engaging enough to keep one going.  I read all of it only because it was selected by my book club.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|This is another one of those rare movies that a parent can enjoy with their kids!  Just trust me, it's funny!
B00CHIMG6Y|2.0|You can never get that time back again so I would not recommend watching what at first glance seems like a good movie.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I own a roku; Apple TV and now a chromecast. When you by a mobile device you are buying into a platform and I feel google will get all there ducks in a row. Roku has tons of different channels and games but doesn't have watchESPN or YouTube. Apple TV has YouTube, AirPlay and wachESPN and HBO go but no where near the channels that Roku has and you are unable to queue videos with Apple TV which is a killer feature chromecast has. I see a future in chromecast where you will have options to all the channels (including watchESPN and HBO go and others apps like spotify and radio). Chromecast has the ability to become both Apple TV and Roku but combined and that's why the platform matters. And why I am buying into the chromecast platform.
0465011047|4.0|This is about upper class loyal North Korean party members, and what happens when one family member comes under suspicion.  This does not provide as much insight into life on the run in rural North Korea and China as Escape from Camp 14... but does give pretty much the same story about the brutality and hardships of the camps
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|Fun game but freezes and then boots you off sometimes<br />Fun for All ages and levels.<br />Wish there was a map to follow.
B00DBSZJRM|3.0|Very goofy action, reminds me of the Evil Dead series with Bruce Campbell but I enjoyed that more than this since it was more funny than serious.  If you liked the older Evil Dead you will mist likely enjoy this.
B001HN6918|5.0|I've rated this movie as a sequel.  I'll admit I was skeptical when I saw that kung-fu panda was going to have a sequel.  Where could they go with it?  But I was very pleasantly surprised!  And my kids love it!
B00E4ZOQR0|5.0|You can get it on August 1st for $34.99 the official release date!!!(Lego.com)<br /><br />It's a most for any die hard Lego Fans!
B0061C1NQ6|5.0|This book is by no means a modern detective story. Instead of relying on all the modern forensics of today, he protagonist must rely on himself. A wonderfully complicated novel both from a historical point, but also from a romantic point.
0143122916|5.0|The author gives the escapee's story, plus insights into why the escapee changed his story, and what happened while trying to adjust to a life of freedom.  The story of a boy born inside the camp,  is very interesting.  The book also showed how the escapee was able to avoid arrest while on the run in North Korea.  Also interesting, was the account of living as an undocumented alien in China.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Super fun to play, a good way to pass time. Much better than the original version, and super addictive, this game is really awesome.
0887431453|5.0|I'm not sure how educational this 'workbook' is, but it is definitely a great coloring book!  My daughter loved coloring each of the pages, with total disregard for the instructions.
B00AW57L96|4.0|I found the story a bit unbelievable but it rolled along quite well and I went with it. So this one is a winner. I guess a novel doesn't have to be believable to be a good read.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|The folks that put this Blu-ray version together of the original series did an amazing job.<br />They were successful in keeping the original flavor alive while bringing amazing special effects clarity and detail to life.<br />I LOVE THIS SET.  It takes me back to my childhood and brings the series into the future.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|There are already a lot of reviews on Amazon and goodreads both and many go into a lot of detail so I won't bother. The writing was weak with a lot of repetition. I didn't care much for any of the main characters and there were far too many plot points that I simply could not suspend disbelief and accept.<br /><br />Just a few brief examples:<br />Christian Grey is a \\"mega-industrialist\\" and a billionaire. Apparently just being an industrialist or a millionaire wasn't good enough, but what exactly is a \\"mega\\" industrialist? He's a self made man who built a corporation from the ground up. Given that he's like 27 and I assume he's been to college he can't have been in the workforce more than five years or so but he's already built this huge corporation, he's a skilled pilot and a concert level pianist. As if these accomplishments aren't enough, he's never actually working in the book. When did he find the time?<br /><br />Then there's Jose. I am still trying to figure out how Jose, the decent enough guy that has like Ana for years and tried to kiss her once, once, is the bad guy. Meanwhile Christian, the creepy guy with the stalker tendency, the guy who whisks her away to his hotel, finds out she's a virgin and quickly announces he's going to \\"fix that problem\\" is the hero?<br /><br />As the title indicates, the story does slowly improve. By the end I was mildly curious how it was going to turn out and found, despite myself, that I did sort of care about the couple. I care enough that I just might skim read the second book if I can find it for free somewhere. I would not pay ten dollars for it and I would not suggest paying full price for this one either.

B00364K6YW|5.0|This classic interpretation of Austen's timeless classic is to this day by far the best movie rendition of the book!
B0045HCIZY|5.0|This is number 1 and if you enjoy it, as we did, you will want to watch number 2 as we did.  We are now waiting for the third to show up.  Number three is no longer in local theaters and we are waiting for it to show up here.
1451613512|4.0|This book is a whopper to read!  600 pages of small print and close typed text makes it more like a 1000 pages of normal book reading, so it takes a few weeks to get thru it all. Is it worth your time to read such a massive book? Clearly the book presents a left-wing liberal interpretation on the actions of the United States over the last century or so, as it became the dominate world power.  A single book is unlikely to change your political philosophy so if you are already a liberal, you will probably be shocked by the force of the allegations in this book for the evilness of the USA military-industrial complex.  If you are a right wing conservative, you can dismiss the book as left-wing spin.  Either way - given the dominance of the USA in the world today - the book is worth  a read because reading different and multiple points of view about important issues makes you much better informed.<br /><br />I found one of the most revealing aspects in the book was the description of the several missed opportunities (after both world wars and end of the cold war) for the world be led (by the USA) into an era of peaceful co-operation.  Instead, conservative forces kept repeating history and ended up taking a competitive pathway that - the book contends -  has exacerbated the difference between rich and poor that persist across the globe today.  In taking the lead against burgeoning russian/communist power, the book argues that the USA tended to simply support 'anti-communist' governments rather than 'pro-democratic' governments, with this tactic leading to autocratic right-wing dictactorships in much of south america, africa and the middle east for the latter half of the 20th century.  Well written and with many photos to complement the text, the book helps itself get read and gives you an interesting view point on how the USA came to be the dominant world power it is today - what about tomorrow?<br />regards<br />david in melbourne australia.
B008I34XX6|5.0|I had not seen this movie in along time and was so glad to see it offered for sale on DVD. This is a good one Peter O'toole is great as usual.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|What's not to love? This is a superb film. Having it allows me to see it as many times as I want. All is well!
B001DTUTU8|5.0|Okay, I am a huge Dr. Seuss fan (as well as a reasonably-sized Jim Carrey fan)!  I was a little worried that this movie wouldn't do justice to the masterpiece, but it does!  This and Carrey's Grinch are probably the only two Seuss movies to date that I have enjoyed as much as the books!
B004KPX4W2|4.0|I missed this film when it came out. Didn't even know it existed. It has a stellar cast and they all great job. I just saw that RED 2 is out. I won't miss that one.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Absolutely amazing. It is for sure a tear jerker but<br />an amazing read. Read it in 2days!  I think everyone should give it a try!:)

B009XIXVU6|5.0|loved the story line and Hosseini's style in this book. each chapter was written from the perspective of a different character and it all ties in brilliantly!

B006GWO5NE|5.0|Received the Kindle Fire in very fast time after ordering.  Thought I'd need a tech to transfer my old data- but it was a snap even for a non-rofessional.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|don't bother with this app I downloaded and it does not work won't even open waist of time found another papop1
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is both relaxing and stimulating. The puzzles engage the brain, but there is no stress to speed thru it, you take your time and figure it out. If you get stuck you can buy the solution with coins earned. I only really got stuck with the advance puzzles. The rings are hard to process (you'll see) and the ones that you think will be easy, will stump you, the ones that seem really hard, some times you breeze through. So far it is the best game I have played on my HD kindle fire. I hope you enjoy.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfer is great because it's great for children, being a simpler version of Temple Run... Plus it would be better to be able to go head-to-head with friends! I hope you take this into consideration.<br /><br />-Teddy

B005KIQ2HW|5.0|What can I say, legos are here to stay.  Another generation who loves these toys, which stimulate creativity & small hand skill co-ordination.  Yes, they are small pieces, and my grandkids must take their time to build these models.  I love this for that reason.  They are not tied to some video game or the TV, but actually engaging their minds on building something with their hands and their intellect.  I would highly recommend!
B001UV4XIS|5.0|This is probably my favorite Harry Potter movie of all time!  I just wish they hadn't changed the darn ending!  Other than that, this movie is a must see!
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Actually this new upgrade is a giant leap forward, but a couple small steps backwards.  I do not even comprehend the gimmicky rewards aspect.  Navigating the app is slightly obtuse.  An application for an Android device should simplify your life.  My parents have a Kindle because it is more user friendly than a pc.  By going from forecast to maps and vice versa is weird.  Making radar loop is not clear.  But the screenshots and more current and accurate wether information is greatly appreciated and long overdue.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Simply put..awesome game!!.. my o only complaint is that I wish it was easier to get jewels..but other than that...great!!
B00CUB5PNY|5.0|as with everything from pc to droid there is an adjustment, this provides the same game & easy to lay style droid brings us. very happy with it
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Haven't used this yet, so I can't review it specifically.  It was recommended as a small sharpener that works and I wanted one to include in camping/preparedness supplies.  I felt the price was far, and it had been tested by the site that recommended it, & that was good enough for me.
6305428387|5.0|This movie relates the hilarious true story of Jamaica's first olympic bobsled team.  The acting is great and the acting is very good as well!
B0036S4B6M|4.0|I read this book after watching the Netflix series, so I won't spoil either for you.  I will say that this is a really great example of the book beating the screenplay.  This book feels a bit like Eat, Pray, Love, in the sense that it's a pretty good book, but will probably take a beating for being written by a relatively affluent caucasian woman.  Both books also share the fate of being pretty much the only books on this topic written by a woman of any kind.  Now that I think about it, I might add Lean in to that list....<br /><br />But back to this book, it's paced nicely, described with detail, and includes some really surprisingly touching bits.  I relished the stories and connections, the prison recipes for cheesecake (really!) and makeshift parties and other rituals, and especially the prisoners reactions to the then-contemporary Martha Stuart indictment.  Viewers of the Netflix show may be annoyed to see how many of the characters are twisted around and plots filled with unneccessary drama.  The beauty of this book is the relationships, the triumph of integrity despite great humiliation and insane bureaucracy.  Kerman does learn things, overcome things, and realize things, while also providing some excellent resources and statistics on prison life for women.  I would recommend this to anyone interested in gender, criminal justice, and institutions.  Is it the premier and most all-encompassing book on the topic?  Probably not.  But as the author realizes in her own search for literature on women's prisons, this book is pretty much the first.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This can be summed up in one word, and that is: Beautiful. I love this story, and its emotional effect. Really Beautiful.
B0073U2FB2|4.0|This is just a no-brain fun, &#34;people in peril&#34; kind of movie. I end up watching it whenever it is on cable.  Good mindless fun!<br />The premise is that some alien life in the form of energy-absorbing creatures land in Russia and seem to enjoy killing people (presumably to absorb our energy). Two young American businessmen had just landed in Russia and are the lead characters, along with two beautiful girls. The action centers around trying to avoid the creatures while finding their way out of Russia. The humans finally discover that they can tell when the creatures are near because anything electrical will turn on (such as a car's headlights or streetlights). Otherwise, they are almost completely invisible.<br />It was actually good enough that I've watched it twice when it was on cable. Decent-to-Good acting really helps this movie. There is enough action and character sympathy to keep your interest in the movie. This, and a bowl of popcorn, would be fun with a friend.
157421327X|5.0|Fun book which teaches how to accomplish the Zentanagle process.  I can hardly wait to try my hand at making a Zentangle!
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|Too long to get the game worth playing.<br />But once you get the park up and a little more advanced its worth playing.<br /><br />Price of everything too high...................<br /><br />Too long to build
B001E45XT4|5.0|i am a gamer and these headsets are way good. i have gone 5 straight hours and they dont bother my noggin at all. i like that they cover the entire ear, and the microphone does what its suppose to. i got these for like 30 bucks or somethign, and it was a great purchase. if you looking for affordable headphones with a mic, this is a way good selection.<br /><br />ps, the mic hides neatly away so if your just listening to music it is not in the way and i really enjoy the feature, as well as the integrating volume control on the cord. it is nice to be able to change volume really quick when switching between apps or playing games or whatever it may be.<br /><br />my 4 year old twin nephews also approve.
B00CWVFPGO|4.0|As long as you know you are getting mindless action adventure that's just for fun, it's great. I'll go out on a limb and say no Academy Awards coming.
B00DHNB5CY|3.0|It had really good moments and really bad moments. It averages out. It is disturbing however. I watch a fair share and it is in the better side of scary movies for sure.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is an amazing book. I couldn't put it down! I'm about to read the rest of the series. Highly recommend.
B003KGBIS4|5.0|Have seen all of Anderson's movies and this one by far is the best. Gets better every time I see it. Funny as hell and has a great soundtrack! But before you watch it you should go get a drink and smoke a cigarette.
B008J05EL8|1.0|This should have been included in the office suite. This is just a clear example of companies trying to rip off hard working ppl.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is fantastic. It tells a different side of a cancer story. I would definitely recommend this book. Amazing.
B00DF0POXA|1.0|Just plain bad. Wish I could give it 0 stars, but that option is not available. Sorry kanye but you are no where near as good as you think you are.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I love Suits.  This was a great season with great character development. You will be surprised and once you start, you'll want to watch it all the way through
B005PK553C|4.0|I want season 2 for free. Amazon is like a drug pusher. They give you the first dose, then make you pay for the next one.
B00C9PQ7EW|5.0|This is a wonderful work. Great voice and nice collaboration that made this work come together. The CD with the LP is a nice bonus.
B00CNIDH7A|5.0|I dance and sing along. Then my heart, and gut get pulled in to the emotions Pat Monahan leaves on the table for us.  IMAGINE is epic.  Pat has one of the finest voices of our times.  Loving the past and present Train.  They put on a helluva good concert too.
B007X4N0DU|5.0|BUTT!!!!  Saw them in concert the follow week and YEP!!!  Bruised butt!  (WTF IS A WORD MIN ON A FEED BACK NEEDED FOR)

B00B32X786|4.0|interesting look at adult relationships, Mia Sorvino it incredibly hot, over the top but not impossible, quality chick flick too
B00D6B4PUG|3.0|I wish you could view the screen from more than one angle... disappointed i had to pay for the app
B00CJGP116|1.0|very upset with this Marc Anthony cd...First of all there is nothing new about it sounds like his very first earlier recordings...songs are short and just when it's starting too groove the song is over...seems to me that this cd is for the casual salsa fan...not meant for the real salsa fan...very disappointing...this is a flop... Marc what happen!
B00BS3EMNY|5.0|If you loved or even liked Deleted Scenes you will love this!!!  The CD is amazing!  And who, quite frankly, does not want their own opening music. :)  Buy it and love it!!  Can't wait for her next CD!!
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|This is a must-have CD if you're a fan of Queens of the Stone Age.  It's release was worth waiting for.
B004QX07G4|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I have heard some of the stories before from watching her show so this is why I didn't give it the 5 star .  I did laugh out loud a couple of times while reading.  Give it a try if you live Ellen this book will not disappoint .
B0094BB4TW|4.0|works pretty good, loads fast, wish that some of the chat features worked better, news feed looks great, i like it
B00C4XYEBW|5.0|Anything Priest is awesome, this is no exception! Thanks For your time I have to go now k? Really k
B0052RDHTM|5.0|An excellent and realistic view of what happened during World War I told from the point of view of characters who lived through the drama.
0307744434|3.0|What I loved about this book: the writer has created a richly -luxurious really- drawn world. A cast of exotic and interesting characters who range from people you feel you might know in real life to truly fantastical but still believable.<br />Where the book did not hold up for me:  the plot is built around a dual between master illusionists (and that's no spoiler...that shows up in the 1st or 2nd chapter) but I never had a clear sense of why or how that had come to be so it was hard to understand why the main characters felt so bound to endure what they did to perpetuate it.<br />Explores many of the same themes as \\"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell\\", i.e. the possibility of a magical world that parallels the day to day one. Entertaining and imaginative.
0393317552|1.0|This book is even a horrible read for a History major. Should be in the agricultural section with what it is about.  Unless you are a grad student, don't read it.....teachers don't assign this to high school students.
B00170F0WU|5.0|This was an excellent movie, but better suited for mature audiences due to its graphic violence, foul language, sexual innuendo, and socially deviant behaviors.  I loved the plot.  This movie showed Natalie’s breakthrough talent into movie acting.  At her tender age of 13, she played this role exceptionally well and was very convincing.  It is no wonder after this movie that she went on to have an incredibly successful career in Hollywood.  This was the second time I watched this movie.  The first, in 1994 when it was released.  I suspect I will watch it again in a few years.  It is a must see if you've never seen it.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Well preformed, well written, beautiful house.  An entertaining look into the recent past and a life style we can only imagine.
B005LAIISA|5.0|This is funny movie I watch all the others .The cast is great they did a great job wish Wanda Sikes had more scenes .Wish they made another one  to see Sid geting married.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abbey makes me realize how low class are the sorts of TV shows Americans settle for, namely stories for the witless written by the relentlessly uninventive.
B00821OX98|2.0|Just another show trying to get in on the Walking Dead craze IMO, except instead of zombies we have aliens running around.
B000EULJLU|5.0|I remember a friend of mine attempting to describe Tool's sound to me. \\"Art disguised as rock music\\" is what he came up with.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|I do not like this game.  It does not make any sense to me therefore I will delete it soon.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|A very good game though I felt it was too short, got them done pretty quickly, am looking forward to the updates.
B004LOMB2Q|1.0|I originally tried this on my Nexus 4 last year. I found it to be way too much for my needs and it required an account. The last thing I need is yet another account with yet another ID and PW. After reading the fine print, I dumped the free version.<br /><br />Fortunately, Google Keep was released and it is just what I need *and* in WIDGET form. It has notes, check lists, insert camera or regular pix and, supports Google Talk for audio notes (real handy for a quick reminder note while waiting for the green light!).<br /><br />It seamlessly updates with your existing Google account and to all your devices. It's COOL.<br /><br />The widget supports scrolling through your notes and lists (and pix within them) but I wish they could program into the widget multiple column views. Currently, the only way to get those is to first select one of your lists or notes and hit the back key; VIOLA! But it turns the widget into a full page app.<br /><br />If you find Evernote way too intrusive with both its endless permissions and its overkill approach, give Keep a try.
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|Honestly, this movie was very well balanced and probably the most fun you will ever have at a movie theater this year. Everything was so well balanced that I cant complain about anything. There's giant robots vs Monsters fight scenes but also science behind them, There's cute romance but also tiny funny moments. This movie is better than the Avengers, I'm comparing the two because they are both the definition of summer movies but the avengers just had way to much snarky comebacks and douche witty comments, the avengers was too saturated with iron man's attitude that everyone in the entire movie had a snarky comment to say. If you want a Fun, Action, Epic, visually Jaw-Dropping framework and CGI, with a little romance and comedy, GO SEE THIS FILM!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Super fun game ...My kids love it. It's a lot like subway surfers but I think way better..very cute . I love it!
B004J4XGN6|5.0|This is already a classic and you can indeed achieve enlightenment by reading it. :-)<br />You might have various opinions on the content, but in any case it is a must read book.<br />And it is reasonably short.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Much better than the stock HTC sense 2 keyboard on my Incredible 2.<br /><br />I love the predictive text, which is much better than any other I've used. Instead of trying to only complete a random word (usually the most used word), this one looks at the preceeding word, then suggests something based on that.  It even takes capitalization into account.<br /><br />The only drawbacks I can see is that swipe is just \\"ok\\" since it sometimes suggests the wrong word, especially when the successive letters are next to each other (but is correct most of the time), which forces you to delete that word and manually type it (which then the predictive text usually shows the correct words).<br /><br />I wish accented letters were available without having to change the keyboard language entirely...<br /><br />Last gripe is moving the cursor around... Since I don't have a touch ball or surface to move it, the HTC UI allows you to touch where you want, then usually gives a little green drop you can grab and move the cursor to the precise location.  After installing this keyboard, that functionality is largely gone and trying to put the cursor in the right spot is a Crap shoot... It never lands somewhere in the middle of some sentence/paragraph where I want, which necessitated me to enable the arrow buttons at the bottom so I can move the cursor around. This is much less intuitive than the HTC method.<br /><br />Other than that I love this keyboard!
B00BQLSB3A|2.0|The only reason why I wanted this movie of \\"Christine\\" on Blu-ray is because the eighties were my favorite era of movies.<br /><br />When I was ready to buy it from Screen Archives Entertainment, I was hesitant to buy it because it would have cost me over $30.00 to buy it from them. (You know, $29.99 plus shipping, plus tax, etc, etc) No stinkin' movie is worth thirty bucks. A few days later, it was said to be sold out. But then, a few months later, I saw that someone was selling it on Ebay starting at $30 for bidding, So, I figured, what the heck. If I get it for about $35, I'll only grumble for a day.<br /><br />Well, as the deadline was approaching to make the highest bid, and that there were only 2 bidders locked in on this purchase, I entered $50.02 just for the heck of it thinking nobody's going to bid any higher. I hoped to God that I wouldn't have to actually pay $50 for this not-so-fabulous film, but low and behold, I was the winner at just under $46. Five additional bids popped in like at the last two minutes of the deadline. At first, I felt a small victory for winning the purchase, but then, I sure felt stupid that I got stuck paying a whole freakin' $46 for it.<br /><br />And even after I watched it, I felt even more taken advantaged of by bidding for and buying this one single movie on Blu-ray for $46.  The transfer isn't anything much better than the DVD. Some scenes were sharper, but most of the film you wouldn't really see much of an improvement. You can see that some people are already selling their bought copy used for about $70 bucks. That should tell you right there that the Blu-ray release of this film is nothing too impressive to replace your DVD with.  So, I'm sure that you will be disappointed too if you pay too much like I did.<br /><br />Well, I've had it for nearly a month now and I thought that I finally got over my depression for paying so much for it. But then, my credit card bill came with this EBay purchase, again in my face, and that just got me all disgruntled all over again. Because, \\"Oh Yeah, I forgot, I still gotta pay for it! Uggh!\\"<br /><br />Oh well, live and learn, huh?<br /><br />OH, by the way, you can get this blu-ray of Christine through Amazon from Germany.  They've got it.  It's region free, and it's under $20 US.<br /><br />(...)<br /><br />__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />Oh, a review about the actual movie: It's a movie about the devil (probably), born on this earth as a red car in the 1950's, and years later it gets bought by some kid with an obviously low self-esteem, but then this red car makes him all mean to everybody and so he starts to diss his parents and his very few friends and he basically dies in the end somehow because at least two people are kinda concerned about his changed behavior and his warped love for his deadly red car.

B009IJJ5B4|1.0|As a re-boot of a Sherlock Holmes story it is interesting look, however I Just could not get into it.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I use the Kindle app for my phone. It works great and I didn't need the reader itself. I recommend the app if you can't take your Kindle with you.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|This is a great show. I really like all the characters. I would prefer less cursing though and then it would be perfect.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|Couldn't put the book down, very interesting and thought provoking. Great history lesson as well. I highly recommend this for everyone.
B0094K1MH2|4.0|This movie is in the vain of Indiana Jones, but it is animated.  I thought it was about the dog, but TinTin is the boy (man?).  Fun movie.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|YOU GO, Jessica Lange! Not as &#34;spooky&#34; (although there are some few parts that give gooseflesh) as they make it out to be, but I want to watch Season 2.
B005MLOKXA|4.0|Lawyer shows can get overwhelming in the lawyer world vernacular to the point where they are hard to follow or boring.  This show does a great job of tugging at your heart strings in a non-cliché way and also providing a mentally stimulating plot line.
B00DURILJ2|4.0|Let me say right off the bat that I loved everything about Take Shelter. It was original, it had all the great acting and camera work, and it sustained one of the best hooks that I've ever seen in a movie right to the very end. While Mud shares most features, I don't see the whole point of the \\"originality\\" that people brag about it. It is a good movie with great acting, but not a great movie. It doesn't have the special hook that Take Shelter had. While Matthew's acting is fresh, I think the credits should go to the child actors; undoubtedly, they did a wonderful job making the scenes real and believable. Unfortunately for me, the story resembles too much the Dickens's Great Expectations.
B004DSX5B6|4.0|Bear is awesome but man these tools are expensive. The tool is durable and made with quality metal, but a leather man tool with similar attachments will cost $10 cheaper.
B008Y768XO|4.0|Good movie.  It is a tear jerk-er!  Not a movie to watch if you are look for a pick me up. It is a movie the little ones will want to watch again.
B003L77GG0|5.0|I'm not a comic book person nor do I follow Superman, but I know enough about &#34;him&#34; to have started Season 1 of Smallville. I thought the Clark Kent premise was great and enjoyed the entire series, except that the whole Lana Lang whiny on again/off again for the better part of a few seasons almost made me stop watching...I liked the actress, but the story line was really getting on my nerves...thank goodness the producers ended that. Anyway, take several SEVERAL hours out of real life and escape to Smallville!
B000BYA5GE|4.0|This is a movie that is based on fact. Remember, based on fact does not mean it's is factual. It's a really good movie which tells an important story but remember it is the Hollywood edition.
1451695195|3.0|Perhaps I was waiting for a \\"WOW\\" moment that would make the reader really understand Dr. Alexander's experience and when the moment did not arrive, there was disappointment.
B0095VPAVE|4.0|I was well happy with how it performed before I handed it off to the family members who bought it.
B00ABKGG0C|4.0|I still have no idea what's going to happen and I'm 85% of the way through with this book. Impressive!  This book really is a 4.5 stars for me-- not sure what it needs to be perfect, it's pretty darn close.
B003QSPTAY|5.0|Glad you offer it and others like it. Keep up the good work and remember that oldies are goldies. Thanks
B000F1IQMS|5.0|This is a great movie! I bought the dvd after having seen the movie a few times and I will watch it again later. I hate watching movies over and over, but this one is a winner. Based on fact and if you are into the historical, dramatic and well produced movie, this is it!
B00BRUYQFC|1.0|I downloaded the MP3 and some songs sound good but others seem like the volume is too low and others to loud.
B005ZMUWWY|5.0|This is one of our favorite family movies.  The kids love the quirky Wall-E and the love story with the sleek robot Eva.  The adults appreciate the nostalgia mixed with a tongue-in-cheek commentary on how technology and big-box business could ultimately shape our lives.  I think of this movie every time I sit on a bus and see everyone engrossed in their smart phones. Very entertaining.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Professional acting by everyone -even minor characters.<br />You care about these people - which is crucial to a good drama.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|This game is very good but only when it's on hard it's actually really  scary to me. I wish it was a lot more locations available. That's the only sad part.  You should also only play it a night in the night. Trust me!! The game would live up to its reviews that way.
B007SSDBBM|5.0|I love how romantic this movie is. It makes me wish men were like that in real life, well at least the ones I date anyway.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|It's nice to see a show that doesn't lose its basic mystery/procedural charm when they up the ante on the relationship! Castle has always delivered entertaining stories along with the growing romantic relationship between the leads.. This season, Castle and Beckett are finally together.  Thank you, writers, for NOT turning it into a soap opera with paranoid lovers. The characters stay true to their intelligent selves, while still experiencing those fun issues of any relationship...and they keep doing their jobs. Bravo!
B0040I09RM|4.0|Good show that builds as the seasons go. Good cast with some notable guest appearances. Ron Perlman and Katey Sagal have good chemistry on the show
B004T2QZL8|4.0|I am addicted to.this game. It is always full of surprises, plus you have to think! You have to try it.
140006922X|5.0|It's true that Aslan does not bring new research to the table, which would be extremely ambitious considering the extent of historical scholarly research already existing. There were many additional points of controversy not included, but I realize that they are outside the scope of Aslan's thesis. He does a remarkable job bringing many of the various historical claims and conclusions into a well-written and accessible narrative.<br /><br />Note the word accessible- many who've devoted years to biblical study may be annoyed (as I was) that each reference and claim didn't have an endnote to the bibliography. There are extensive notes, however, and all scriptural references are included. That said, this is the first nonfiction book that I can confidently give someone to read and know that they can get through and enjoy it. That means a lot to me, since most of my reading is too dry to discuss outside of graduate seminars. I'm excited to give this book to friends who wouldn't usually read scholarly history.<br /><br />I'd encourage skeptics to give it a try- approach it as history, not scripture, and appreciate what the book has to offer. I personally found the account of Jesus in Zealot much more identifiable than the way he's portrayed in any traditional Christian texts.
B004X75RK4|5.0|I love this movie I watch this movie over and over!!! Totaly worth your money, and your time, because it is just so awesome.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|It is an amazing tale of the underdog infused with a helping of 80s gaming movie music references. Read this book now
B00CATSONE|3.0|I downloaded about 30 free books all at once and have not read but a few of them.  Hoping to get them all read soon.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is fun, yet a tad challenging.  It's a game you can play with distractions and one you can play s couple days later without having to start all over again.
B000MD9UJC|5.0|I couldn't believe the difference this made to what I thought was an already excellent beam. Very bright, clear, no 'lines' around the light. The end, on/off  clicker is very handy. Arrived as expected. When I changed the bulb it didn't feel quite right at first, but it's easy to do, just mess with it till it feels right, then it works great. Next I'm getting the LED upgrade for the 2, D cell flashlight.
B00CUWWLWG|3.0|I really liked this game. I've been playing it everyday... and then it crashed! As soon as it finished loading, there's this funny cash register sound then it shuts itself down. What is going on? I've uninstalled and re-installed it, but no luck. The thing no longer works, so as much as I love this game... I don't really know how to rate it. Great game, but... glitchy.
B000P407K4|5.0|Great comedy! Black hearted as it might be, the performances are just wonderful (especially George C Scott), and as always Peter Sellers understated approach is spot on.
B00D3XAA4M|3.0|I downloaded about 30 free books all at once and have not read but a few of them.  Hoping to get them all read soon.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I received my chromecast and set it up in just a few minutes. Much much better experience than the GoogleTV I had. I downloaded the chromecast app rom the Play Store for my android phone and it found it quickly and I just punched in the password for the wifi and I was good to go.<br /><br />The apps that it does work with work great. I've used the netflix, google play music and video, and youtube. The beta chrome tab casting works ok but there is a noticeable 2-3 second delay from what's on the computer screen to what shows on the tv.<br /><br />That's about it though. Not many apps support it yet and if you're looking for a netflix/youtube dongle that will fit in your pocket you can't beat it for the price.<br /><br />Giving it 4 stars for now due to the lack of app support. It really need Amazon video and mp3 as well as Hulu.
B003Q299MO|5.0|I bought this Album when it came out in the early 70's. I opened it, recorded it and put it away. The vinal album was warped when there was a fire & my albums wern't properly cared for afterwards. I wish I knew how 'un-warp' an album, then I would have a really collectable item. When I saw this CD on Amazon I was extatic, I chose the more expensive (and last) collectors edition. It came so fast I had no idea what I was opening, and,,, it was very well packaged. The CD case is perfect, it even came with an extra insert with the words to the songs in English and Japanese, (that wasn't even in the original vinal album). It sounds Great, no skips or ticks. Not a scratch or fingerprint on it. If you even 'Kinda' Like Hendrix, GET THIS CD before they all sell out.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This game is very cool and is for any age! Yet it's still fun for the whole family and who doesn't love card<br />games
B00BTHWFBK|2.0|I was excited to hear that the original Black Sabbath -- minus Bill Ward -- were making a new album, but was disappointed upon actually hearing it. It struck me as dull, some of it derivative, the drumming is safe and forgettable, the riffs banal. Although Ozzy sounds surprisingly good, his performance sometimes sounds like he's reading the lyrics off a piece of paper, not even knowing what he's saying. It lacks the feeling or soul he has on songs like &#34;N.I.B.&#34;, &#34;War Pigs&#34; or &#34;Sabbath Bloody Sabbath.&#34;<br /><br />Ironically, the four &#34;extra&#34; tracks are better than the eight proper ones; they have more of a spark and sound fresher.<br /><br />That said, it's growing on me. I think it's great that the Sabbath boys (minus Ward) are still making music together 43 years after their first album. Hopefully they'll make more (with Ward) but, if not, this is a respectable way to go out.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Yes, it sounds like 70's Black Sabbath but with a weak guitar sound (compare it to the sound on BLACK SABBATH), safe drumming and songs that initially strike you as dull, except for the extra tracks. It's definitely better than NEVER SAY DIE and maybe on par with TECHNICAL ECSTASY, except that the best ECSTASY songs are arguably better than the best ones here (of the first eight). Don't expect exceptional songs like &#34;Black Sabbath,&#34; &#34;War Pigs,&#34; &#34;Supernaut&#34;, &#34;N.I.B.&#34;, &#34;The Wizard&#34;, &#34;Under the Sun&#34;, &#34;Snowblind&#34; and &#34;Sabbath Bloody Sabbath&#34;.<br /><br />Still, it's an okay album. I like it better than most of the Tony Martin era, but not as much as the Dio era. I prefer THE DEVIL YOU KNOW from 2009; it was doomy, like this one, but with a fresher feel and eerie vibe. 13 comes across as hackneyed and tired by comparison.<br /><br />GRADE: C-
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|Have not tried this app just yet but still have it on my kindle.  I am sure it won't be exactly as I thought it to be but sure it will be interesting none the less.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Each season seems more enjoyable than the last; great writers and great actors, per usual, equate to a great show
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Just wasted an entire day on this game...and it was totally worth it! Amazing graphics, fascinating story, challenging puzzles...wish there was more; I really didn't want it to end!
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|A very fun game. Addicting and super awesome. You can earn animals. And get points. A very good game. It's cool
B009Z5BPZK|5.0|Just love all things Gossip Girl and needed the last season. Sad that it is over, but Great ending, thanks
B00881VLCE|1.0|Have not tried this app just yet but still have it on my kindle.  I am sure it won't be exactly as I thought it to be but sure it will be interesting none the less.
B001F0WXY0|5.0|recently reread this one on a trip to the american southwest desert.  There were day in the AZ sun that I wanted a stillsuit.  The fremen are a great invention.  Very satisfying classic that stands up since I first read it 20 years ago
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|No problems setting this up using my Macbook.  After it's installed on a TV HDMI port, and that port is selected on the TV, you get a TV screen giving you a URL to go.  There you download and run an OS X app, which sets up the device -- basically getting it on your wi-fi network.<br /><br />I then tested out casting from Youtube on Android phone and tablet, screen casting movies running in Chrome on the computer, and also casting from Google music.  All worked exactly as advertised.  I didn't notice significant lags when screen casting, but that is probably because my router is about 2 feet from the Chromecast player.<br /><br />So if what it does is what you want, I highly recommend it.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|The movie was really good. To me, it showed how loyal a pet can be. I bought it for my grandchildren.
B001KZG99A|5.0|The move was great and loved that I could watch it immediately after purchasing it. Definitely recommend using Amazon Instant Video.
B006DJ2JSI|3.0|Have not tried this app just yet but still have it on my kindle.  I am sure it won't be exactly as I thought it to be but sure it will be interesting none the less.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|I really enjoyed this novel.  Great characters, but I just want more of them ... otherwise I'd have given it 5 stars, more of a novella length and scope than a novel
B009NQZVKG|4.0|Always a great story teller. Maybe a little far out but a lot of fun.  On par with other Sima Force novels.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I've read every Agent Pendergast book, and never tire of getting the next 'surprise' - and this one has plenty of them.  I also liked that there was a second story working regarding Corrie Swanson which intertwined with the main story.  As long as Preston and Child keeps writing them, I'll keep reading them
B009YP9L7U|4.0|A good read.  It was a little on the predictable side but overall I enjoyed the ride and the spice.  *** Spoiler ***  It was obvious Carter...I mean Connor :-) was going to eventually come to his senses and of course Megan would just fall right in line.  No man's an island...  This would be a great Hallmark movie!
B00ABGEFWC|2.0|Found other games I was more happy to play so I deleted this game to make room for other ones!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I loved the intro, but the change in cadence to the main story line initially threw me off.  I'm glad I persevered since this is a gem of a story!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it to others. Maybe if more men were like this, we could find another way to resolve issues without war.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Absolutely riveting!  What a mess...what a homecoming!  The subject matter is a bit tough but worth the journey.  I simply adored the characters, the banter, and the wit.  It was even better the second time around.  No doubt there will be a third run sometime in my future.
B008M87GJK|3.0|Have not tried this app just yet but still have it on my kindle.  I am sure it won't be exactly as I thought it to be but sure it will be interesting none the less.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Dont let the abstract introduction stop you.  This is a very human and very heart breaking story.  I laughed and cried a lot reading it.  Both happy tears and genuine grief tears.  Check out The Messenger by Zusak if you like this, its lighter hearted but a lot of fun with out the gravitas of the Book Thief.
1591795230|5.0|So far - I'm loving this book - Bruce H. Lipton sheds new light on me and my old beliefs.
B00C2IN7CG|5.0|This the best Batman movie ever.  Michael Keaton is unrivalled in his interpretation, Michelle Pfeiffer is the ultimate Cat Woman and Christopher Walken is matched as a Batman villain only by Heath Ledger.  The movie absolutely sparkles in this Blu-ray edition.  An outstanding example of what a comic book hero movie should be.
B00BHBBSZ2|3.0|Have not tried this app just yet but still have it on my kindle.  I am sure it won't be exactly as I thought it to be but sure it will be interesting none the less.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Really the people behind the movie are going to a special place in hell for ruining this absolutely marvelous book.  Talk about missing the point.  This is a collection of very human stories behind a catastrophic global event.  No CGI action movie nonsense, no silly brad pitt hero character.  Scary in the very plausibility of the story itself!  Not a bad way to familiarize yourself with the frame of mind necessary for surviving any disaster... natural or zombie!
0736041850|5.0|Great book - Thank you Frederic Delavier I now can see what muscle group I'm actually working - great illustrations.
B001V9LRV0|5.0|This is a review of the contents of the four DVDs of this package, not the packaging or the non-DVD contents.<br /><br />Four discs of madness, including the original movie cut over two discs, and two more discs of outtakes.<br /><br />Disc 1, the first half of the original movie: it opens with the movie rating \\"Restricted\\" going up in smoke as the movie starts (hooray!!!). Quoting an old timer, \\"I had no problem with the kids. This thing was too big, too big for the world.\\" Hippies on horses, Porsches rolling in, dune buggies. Bronze, young attractive stage hands building the stage. Painted buses. Yogi hanging out. Nuns flashing peace signs. Twilight dancers stripping, couple going off to make it in the bushes, it's a miracle of editing. Gerry Garcia is the first musician we see. Bill Graham talks. Bob Neuwirth on camera. \\"I gotta split.\\" Grace Slick, Joe Cocker, Janis Joplin, Gerry Garcia. Yogi doing his thing. Cool announcements. \\"Ellen Savage, please call your father.\\" Brown acid warning. Ritchie Havens' foot in closeup, he gets the crowd to clap hands with his great rhythm and kazoo mic, he runs offstage still playing his nutty guitar. During the Canned Heat set some guy comes up to the vocalist Bear, takes a Marlboro Red off him, hugs him, stolls off stage. Bass player is right into it, man. Joan Baez pregnant, tells about her husband in jail. Sings \\"Swing Low Sweet Chariot\\" a cappella. Great camera editing at the beginning of \\"See Me, Feel Me\\". Pete Townsend with long hair, Daltry's extreme fringe jacket. Daltry gets lost in lyrics at the end. Lousy shots of Keith Moon, we hardly see him. Pete throws guitar up in the air and catches it for solo, then suddenly throws that SG into the audience!! Sha Na Na looking' very very happy. California hippy gives a yoga lesson from the stage and in the field. Joe Cocker doing air guitar as he sings into his star boots. Who was his amazing guitarist? \\"Mad Dogs And Englishmen\\". Storm's coming. \\"Hey if you think real hard, maybe we can stop this rain,\\" call to crowd. \\"Please move away from the towers.\\" \\"No rain\\" chant. \\"Keep thinking it.\\" Great weather drama. Naked hippies in rain interview, they are just about getting clean and keeping their clothes dry. \\"The mud's a hassle. It's a drag, it's a bummer. It's fine, it's all right.\\" Conspiracy theories abound. \\"Why are the fascist people seeding the clouds. People of unknown origin are seeding the clouds.\\" Tribal chant, mud slide hill. White shirt in rain. Peace chant. \\"These people are communicating with each other, that rarely happens any more. Pass the joint montage, roll-a-pipe. \\"I was rapping with the fuzz, can you dig it,\\" says Arlo Guthrie. Ten Years After's Alvin Lee has a very cool leather wrist band. Other guitarists are wearing watches. Watches!!<br /><br />Disc 2, the second half of the director's cut version of the movie, offers a fragment, then gets into interviews with concertgoers, now a girl with big teeth and a headband and a lumber jacket talking about a lost sister, talking about cats who were tripping (she says she wasn't, but, well...), and about people phoning home. The Jefferson Airplane guy has a hooked cross pendant. John Sebastian sings to a video accompaniment of babies everywhere - peeing, feeding, running naked. Country Joe's \\"Vietnam Song\\" is a massive highlight, but with the bouncing ball karaoke it also becomes a bit comical and silly, and no other songs in the film get the bouncing ball. Weird. Townspeople interviewed, receptive or hostile against kids. Great long skinny dipping sequence - beautiful girls, shorthaired college kids, soaking up the rays. Carlos Santana explosive on Gibson SG, great! Amazing drummer!! Sly Stone's set is also amazing. During Janis Joplin's set, all cameras were on her, ignoring the rest of the musicians. \\"What I have in mind is breakfast in bed for 400,000. Now it's not gonna be steak and eggs or anything, but it's gonna be good food and we're gonna get it to you. We're allfeeding each other. We must be in heaven, man. There's always a bit of heaven in a disaster area.\\" Shows nodding guy. Hamburger guy help. \\"If you're too tired to chew, pass it on.\\" Long Port-O-San endorsement. Max Yasger speech. Weird roaming location shots during Jimi's set, but also lots of closeups on his fingers. Guy with crutches eating watermelon in the wasteleand. Naked frisbee.<br /><br />Disc 3, at 180 minutes, is the single longest disc in the set, and contains more songs by Joan Baez, Country Joe MacDonald, Santana, Canned Heat, the Who, Jimi Hendrix, Sha Na Na, Jefferson Airplane and Joe Cocker, but also songs by Mountain, the Grateful Dead, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Johnny Winter, and Paul Butterfield. Footage of Max Yesgar before the festival, a radio ad for the festival advertising $7, $14 and $18 tickets. Santana himself singing \\"Lord Knows You've Got To Change\\", along with the rest of the band. Canned Heat's 11-minute version of \\"On The Road Again\\" is awesome. After a burning set by Mountain, we get the weird, slow creep of the Grateful Dead, with Pigpen right up there, and what looks like Paul Kantner playing bass, two drummers, smoke bombs at the end that scare off one of the drummers... holy smokes, it went on for 38 minutes!! The CCR set shows the muscular, bearded drummer in the Mickey Mouse shirt, I think I saw him play at Monterey as well, perhaps with Country Joe MacDonald, and he's looking very intense by the end of the set. CCR does a great version of \\"I Put A Spell On You\\", wow!! John Fogerty does a very cool solo on his great big Rickenbacker. By their third song they're really swinging, playing an amazing mouth harp on a nine-minute song. The Who play \\"See Me, Feel Me\\", followed by \\"My Generation\\", which was probably their set opener. \\"This is a song about you and me, because we're getting a bit old,\\" Roger tells his Woodstock audience - his audience at Woodstock in 1969, ha ha ha!!! Johnny Winter does an amazing set, Paul Butterfield the only so-so performer in the set so far (he had a great horn section, though). Shots of Hendrix watching Sha Na Na. The Who looking freakish in yellow, playing near-gothic music. There's one section that shows a RIP montage of all of the people who played Woodstock who are no longer with us - Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, Pigpen, some of the guys from Canned Head... RIP Woodstock.<br /><br />Disc 4, at 105 minutes, is the shortest disc in the set, and contains a documentary, \\"From Festival To Feature\\". Shows many many many interviews with the people who created the festival, and who created the film, nearly all of whom were off-camera. In part it is about film technique and editing, and is a loving ode to the Eclair NPR camera. They talk about the heat of the camera, its film stocks, and the pain and agony of holding them, the challenge of buying 365,000 feet of film, with helicopters bringing the film in batches because the distributor lied about having enough on hand. Wide angle lens brought intimacy with the Canned Heat cigarette guy. Many segments are strung together, and end with a brief \\"Produced in association with 1K Studios\\" clip, which gets annoying after a while. Jocko Marellino of Sha Na Na talks about the opportunity, and how it made them famous, Ten Years After initially turned down the gig as it wasn't offering enough money, but they realised that they couldn't afford not to play Woodstock. Chip Monck, now with white hair and a curly mustache looking cool, noted how making announcements tended to get smoother and easier with time.<br /><br />The documentary talks a lot about technical problems that they had in editing the footage, particularly in syncing sight with sound - the film was shot in early August, synchronization only completed at the end of September, early October. First cut of the film was 6-7 hours long. Warners wanted Jimi's segment reduced to only three minutes. Ending was too disturbing with garbage mountains everywhere, hippieson crutches. Jimi was cut from 15 minutes to only 9-10 eventually. The disc includes interviews with members of Sha Na Na, Jefferson Airplane, Ten Years After, Sanatana, Hugh Hefner (\\"I'm glad I wasn't there. I wouldn't have enjoyed the mud.\\") Martin Scorsese (who was an editor on the film, and who noted that lighting was a problem, as Chip had lit for the crowd, not for the camera). There's a very brief segment with Johnny Winter, whose bloodshot face looks like raw meat. Hugh Hefner's quote of \\"There's been no other moon landing or Woodstock\\" is a bit disingeneous, as there has been another Woodstock! Oh well... Curiously enough, the parts of the film where they talk about the revolutionary split screen presentation of footage was itself done in split screen, showing the old with the new, and it's interesting to see how the film-makers themselves have aged in their then-and-now shots.eld the only so-so performer in the set so far (he had a great horn section, though).

B000FC2L1E|5.0|I would and do recommend this book and anything written by Diana. This is my second reading of the Outlander series
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Entertaining and challenging game . Levels went by way too quickly.<br /><br />  Definitely worth downloading and I am looking forward to additional levels being added.
B001UW58YK|5.0|It was a lot of singing and just the right amount of talking between songs. Michael Buble is amazing and shows his ability quite well in this blu ray. Thumbs up! Great to watch in your living room with friends or significant other with a glass of wine.
B007SYWFRM|2.0|Just wasn't very good at this one do I have deleted it from the kindle I own already.  Not bad game just not for me!
B00CLD65X0|5.0|So amazing..it was hard to wait for the next episode!  The story of the Servants and the Grantham Family make it feel as if you are watching two &#34;stories&#34; instead of one.  It makes me want to be BRITISH..ha!
B004U8VX2M|2.0|When Upstairs Downstairs originally aired I was young & too busy to watch. I sure remember all of the press about what a great series it was, though, and was always a little disappointed that I missed it. I have to say, I'm 5 episodes in & so far not impressed. I'll finish it, just to say I saw it, but it sure is NO Downton Abbey. I probably should not have watched DA first.
B00991TCOG|5.0|Love to hear Lindsey Stirling play and watch her videos on youtube.  It would be even better if she would also sell DVD's of these songs because in the future I would like to watch and hear her music.  Thank you Lindsey for all your hard work.
B00DFRVAC2|5.0|this movie and soundtrack were exactly what they were trying to be..... Awesome and loud!  so good highly recommended yea!

B00AFYZDL2|5.0|Saxon blows it away with driving guitars and a awesome rythem section. this album is a must buy for any who grew up in the 80's listening to great metal.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Good book to read  as a secondary book.. Light plot but well written ... Good ending and I liked the way he tied all the ends together
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|If these fairy-tale spectacles have to be expensive, at least they look it. The special effects<br />virtually never stop coming, and a lot of imagination went into laying out a plotline that<br />would absorb all the potential for fantastic visuals. Even the \\"real life\\" is fun, with a very<br />good cast. The hero and heroine are beautiful, the giants are colorfully disgusting, the king<br />is clueless yet committed, and the faithful lieutenant or whatever he is is Ewan McGregor in a<br />very fashionable beard. And, boy, are the bad guy and his henchman evil. I wouldn't recommend<br />this film for family viewing, though, as some of the violence will frighten the tots.
B00CWVG1Z8|1.0|This movie didn't even stick with the book. Complete waste of money. I understand that movies don't have to be exactly like the book but it should definitely be close. Won't see the others. Even though I highly doubt they will make them.
B008OOYALE|5.0|cool and fast fun I'm happy to say that monastic people should get it I'm also happy to say get it
B00CKJ2KK2|3.0|The game was really fun made me think of TF2 and I kept playing trying to get the spy class and I was only 2 levels away from getting it, then I come on the next day to continue playing and I get on and I'm back at level one. I don't know why but I looked at my gameloft account and it said I had never played it before so I don't know what to do. Also of by some chance someone from Gameloft sees this and knows how to fix it my username is Tk152rod.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Good game but too much jumping from scene to scene.  It would be better with fewer scene changes.<br /><br />Look forward to the sequel.
B00CATSONE|3.0|Interesting information about Tesla, however I would have liked a little insight into the person. He was flat. I like the long introduction with the stuff abouff genius and the 10,000 hours.

B0046B8GEQ|5.0|One of the best movies ever! Had my husband watch it and he loves it and has Watched the DVD so many times it wore out! Must see if you have not already, great for kids as well as parents/adults. Love Amazon
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Great game. Very good graphics, good diversity of environment. Good difficulty to master. The best part is the ability to customize the character individually.
140006922X|4.0|The Zealots were one of the parties identified by Josephus during the turbulent times of the Jewish-Roman war of 66-70 C.E. Jesus was not strictly a member of this party (most likely, the party arose after Jesus' death), but Aslan identifies him as a zealot, in the original sense of the word, i.e., someone with tremendous religious fervor, and unwilling to compromise to foreign domination.<br /> Aslan's biography of Jesus is quite in accord with conventional scholarship, but of course, his aggregate merit is his ability to present hard facts and complex reasoning to a lay audience. In Aslan's account, Jesus' life must be understood especially in the context of Roman domination. At around the time of Jesus' birth, Judas the Galilean's rebellion took off; this incited a Roman response, and Sephoris (a major city near Nazarteh, Jesus' hometown) was burned to the ground. Jesus, a Galilean peasant, must have been extremely aware of this, and this is surely reflected in his public ministry.<br /> Aslan is quite emphatic in that Jesus was one among many messianic figures in 1st Century Palestine. Judas, Theudas, the Egyptian, the Samaritan, among others, each started messianic and apocalyptic movements, none of which were successful. Even if diverse, these movements were both politically and religiously motivated: facing brutal Roman domination, they arose with the expectation that God would intervene to vindicate Israel and the oppressed, establish his Kingdom and expel, once and for all the foreign occupants.<br /> Jesus was most likely a disciple of John the Baptist, but once his movement was dissolved by Herod Antipas (Josephus' account is much more trustworthy than Mark and Matthew's), Jesus began his own new movement. In Aslan's account, Jesus' ministry is imbued with zealotry, in the sense that no compromise is assumed vis-à-vis the Roman occupation. Whatever passages reflect an intention to compromise with Roman authorities (with the possible exception of \\"Renderunto Caesar\\" saying), are most likely unhistorical, after-the-fact sayings placed by the gospels' authors who, after the Jewish defeat, sought to accommodate their religion to the definite reality of Roman control.<br /> Aslan does not quite say that Jesus was prepared to call for armed action against the Romans, but he does present him as a figure of combined revolutionary and apocalyptic zeal. In Aslan's account, Jesus is extremely politically conscious. I agree with the apocalyptic part. Certainly, Jesus thought of himself as the apocalyptic Son of Man, a figure that would rise on the clouds in the mist of God's wrathful and glorious intervention to expel the oppressors and vindicate the oppressed. But, I doubt Jesus thought he could accelerate such events by taking armed action. His apocalyptic enthusiasm, on the contrary, makes one suspect that Jesus would have thought that God would take care of it all, and that human action would be needless. Jesus' movement would resemble more passive apocalyptic sects, such as Jehovah's Witnesses, than active religious fundamentalists, such as Al Qaeda. I would take seriously John Dominic Crossan's argument that, if Jesus had truly called form armed action, Pilate would have persecuted and executed his followers. The fact that only Jesus was executed at that time, must be a sign that his ministry was considered a threat, but not as dangerous as the previous messianic figures whose followers were all executed.<br /> Be that as it may, Aslan is quite right when he argues the priestly Jewish aristocracy, aptly accommodated to Roman domination, was also uncomfortable with Jesus' denunciation of corrupt Temple practices. And, most certainly, his feverous cleansing of the Temple in Jerusalem, called the attention of both Roman and priestly authorities. Aslan correctly argues that Jesus was executed by the Romans for sedition (the Temple guards may have collaborated in his apprehension, but the Sanhedrin trial is surely fiction, and the account of Jewish participation in his condemnation is probably a literate fabrication in order to gain Roman favor after the destruction of Jerusalem). Pilate, a brutal administrator, would not have hesitated to immediately put an end to the slightest sign of social perturbation, especially during the preparations for Jewish Passover.<br /> Aslan's account is thoroughly secular, so he has no patience for miracles and the resurrection. He devotes almost no time to explore what may have been behind the disciples' claim to encounter a resurrected Jesus. But, he does pay close attention to the way the disciples faced the fact that their master had failed miserably. According to Aslan, the disciples made a fine adjustment: even if he had been crucified, Jesus was after all the Messiah. For, the Hebrew scriptures were far from clear about what the Messiah was supposed to do, and the followers of Jesus soon found enough passages in the Hebrew Bible that described suffering figures. Even if these passages were not messianic prophecies in their original context, Jesus' followers concluded that, indeed, Jesus' death as a suffering Meesiah had been predicted all along. Thus, unlike previous messianic movements that were easily dissolved, this adjustment allowed Jesus' movement to continue.<br /> The most valuable part of the book, in my estimation, is the two final chapters. Aslan describes the role played by Paul and James in the further development of Jesus' movement. Contrary to the beliefs of Christian piety (especially expounded in the book of Acts), the rivalry between Paul and James (and Peter) was quite bitter. Paul, a Hellenistic intruder who never met Jesus, began to preach an independent message of openness to the gentiles and disregard for the Mosaic Law. James, Jesus' brother and leader of the Jerusalem Church, was not strictly opposed to reaching out to gentiles (he eventually agreed to waive the circumcision requirement for gentiles at the council of Jerusalem), but he did desire to keep his brother's movement within the boundaries of Judaism, as Jesus had intended all along. James sent missionaries to counter Paul's preaching. In the final confrontation in Jerusalem, James required Paul to go through purification in the Temple, and Paul's willingness to do so suggests a disposition to recant his former views.<br /> As the book of Acts narrates, Paul was apprehended during this incident, and eventually marched off to Rome. Aslan's point, however, is that the true leader of early Christianity was James, and his stand was most likely the original teaching of Jesus. Paul's theology was a posterior invention.  Nevertheless, historical contingencies gave Paul's ideas the upper hand. James was executed by the High Priest Ananus (in a purely political maneuver, not due to religious reasons), so Jamesian Christianity suffered a significant blow. More importantly, after the Jewish-Roman war, it was no longer tenable to keep Jesus' movement within the boundaries of Judaism. Thus, Paul's ideas, long after his death, became mainstream Christianity.<br /> Aslan's book is not greatly innovative, and not overly scholarly, either. But, his undisputed prosaic talent makes it a great contribution to the lay reader who desires to introduce herself to the historical Jesus' studies. It would have been desirable that, given Aslan's background in writing about Islam and terrorist movements, he would have explored the connection between Jesus' zealotry and the contemporary revival of religious fundamentalism.
B0091REZMW|4.0|My first reaction to this game was that it didn't make any sense. I was surprised when I found I couldn't stop playing.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|When I was asigned to read this book before school I was so mad because summer isn't for reading. I got to points in the book that were so sad. They gave me all these mixed emotions. I actually don't regret reading this book! ~The 11 year old reader
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Chromecast can stream all local content using Plex Media server.<br /><br />What all you need to get this to work:<br /><br />Windows 7/8 machine<br />Plex media server - (Free software you can use to stream)<br />Chromecast<br />Television with HDMI<br /><br />Plex Media server allows you to play all media files through your browser. That then enables you to cast in full screen whatever movie you have stored on your Hard drive. It took me about 20 minutes total to get it working. For 35 bucks it is great to use and the fact that i finally have everything streaming through it helps out tremendously. Thanks.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|This is by far the worst of the three. The story lags. 8 like good \\"mommy porn\\" but there was more sex than story in this book. I found myself skimming over the sex scenes. Then it ends so abruptly that it is followed with a short note from the author that seems to serve as an apology. The author has over complicated the story line with to many people, triangles, and drama. I count at least six triangles. It made my head hurt. She is trying too hard to be Fifty Shades, which is unfortunate because the first two were better than Fifty. The author seemed to attempt to obligated to buy another book, but street this one...well, I don't think I care what happens to Gideon and Eva.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|Basic entertainment that maintained by interest until the very end.  I can recommend to anyone that has similar expectations from books they read.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really like this!!! It really works your brain, and it's very challenging and fun!! It sometimes gets you frustrated... but then you solve it and gets you motivated to keep going to the next room!!
B00571F26Y|4.0|When I read the line that talked about the fact that my mother, aunt and other ladies I knew growing up had not had weight issues and had not exercised..it all fell into place.  Thanks for writing this most informative book!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Fantastic except coin costs, same for characters, to pricey. Other than that the game is great, the theme changes every month and good deals.
B000YJ54DU|5.0|I was entertained.  It maintained my interest and I could recommend this book to anyone that desires similar outcomes from books they read.
0786948523|5.0|I work in customer service, so I know how important it is to make the customer feel welcome. I was having a terrible day today and when I saw the thank you note on the package I couldn't help but smile.<br />The product is in amazing condition; almost new even. Can't wait to use it in my future games.
0316056863|5.0|I felt like she crawled in my head and licked my thoughts. I knew we were twinsies, but damn, I think I'm her doppelg&auml;nger. She's a highly intelligent wit with a generous, giving attitude. She loves the unloved and dislikes the bullies. Her fluency in sarcasm is an  oxygen tank in a cloud of toxic LA air. I can't wait to work for her!
B000002TLX|4.0|I enjoyed this for the most part. There were some tracks I never heard before, but it was nice just to hear Richard Marx again.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|When purchasing I thought this was an English series and wondered what the US series would be like. A wonderful surprise a intelligent look at government today. It became a marathon viewing as we became caught up in the masinations of Frances and his wife. Kevin Spacey is believable and Machiavellian in his portrayal of the character.Can,t wait for the next series.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|This was a good book but not exactly what I thought it would be. I was thanking it would be more blood and guts that it would go into more horrific detail of attacks. But it's still a good book.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|I was so into this story from page 1. Travis seemed like an interesting prospect for Abby until *spoiler* they became a couple. Then he went from a strong, smart, attractive guy to a hulking, possessive, baby. And their rowdy reckless behavior together was annoying. Started off great but went downhill. I already bought the sequel to this story so I have to read it.
B00BUADSMQ|3.0|Typical Bruce Willis action film, plenty of special effects for violence junkie. I probably would not watch again.  Isn't he getting too old for this??
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I bought a different book and this came up as one of suggestions. Somehow it attracted my eye and I took a sample to read.<br />I was intrigued and I bought the book.<br /><br />Fantastic. It was something I didn't expect. I expected it to be a good entertainment and no more but I was wrong. The book hooked me up and I had hard time putting it away when I was reading late at night. The plot is interesting, the language is easy yet not boring, the progression of the story is often different from what you expect and in the end it leaves with you with a desire to find out more.<br /><br />I'm glad there is a second book on the way. Can't wait!
B006DGOV9Q|4.0|I'll start this review by saying that the sender was very courteous and committed to delivering the battery to my address.  My Amazon account did not include the apartment # so the original package was bounced back as undeliverable.  A quick email later and the sender happily resent another battery with the corrected address.  I really appreciated the swift responses and the understanding!<br /><br />The battery itself has been working fine - it's difficult to say much about it as it is a battery.  I will say that before purchasing I did a good amount of research and some other sellers had poor review or there were reports of 'fake' knockoff batteries.  I really can't attest to any of that but this seller seemed quite reputable and sure enough the battery puts new life into my Galaxy S2.<br /><br />The battery is nearly identical to my old one except the new one has rounder edges along its length whereas my previous has very rectangular in shape.  My old battery started to swell around the middle and my phone would shut off while still showing &#62;80%.  Turning it on again would give a 'critically low battery' warning.  Very odd.  I had read online forums stating that hinted that the battery may be swelling and when I looked - sure enough!  Apparently this can mean that it has undergone too many charges and could possibly explode.  Again, I cannot verify that but I felt it wasn't worth the risk and regardless I needed a new battery.<br /><br />Summary: It's a good battery that works.  I am happy.  Thanks!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Found this book to be very suspenseful and loved the way the characters were brought to life, almost felt like I was right there
B003YL4LYI|2.0|This rating reflects my disappointment at the lack of resolution by the author. Too much filler; the plot moved much too slowly; too many non-essential characters that confused rather than clarified the direction of the plot. What direction?<br />Obviously there will have to be a Book Six!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app I Awesome. My 5 yr old can play this game for hours. It's also great for myself to play and have fun. I have recommended this game to others
B009X01ELC|5.0|I got this case for my 8.9&#34; Kindle Fire and I love it. I love that I can rotate the Kindle Fire to be in portrait or landscape view as well as the fact that it is very sturdy and seems well made. I would recommend this case for anyone if you have an 8.9&#34; Kindle Fire.
B005CVWWJY|5.0|Absolutely loved it, have already recommended it to friends. Very interested to see what else the Author will be bringing us.

B00B8BR1YS|5.0|Acting is great, Paltrow in particular is very outstanding.  Screenplay by Stoppard is outstanding.  Deserved all the rewards it got.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This is such a funny, cute, and entertaining summer read. Of course you know the story before you even read the book, it's a typical chick-flick romance story, but hey - it's entertaining and there's several laugh-out moments that makes this books different from the other. I would recommend this book to others out there looking for a fun romance book for pure entertainment.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|English history, legends, a bit of Tolkien, these are some of the influences I see in Martin's series. Book Two is as engrossing as the first and Martin demonstrates his imaginative flair as well as an ability to get inside his POV characters. There are still problems with register: too many Americanisms for what purports to be a medieval or at least ancient time. However he gets away with it and has done his research on warfare, weaponry and other specialized aspects. Another good yarn.
B00881VLCE|2.0|I did not like it at all looking for one like the one i have .Because the one i have i enjoy doing

B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I love the Characters! And the friendships in here. I really do wish the author would tone down on the language....I mean really is it necessary? Aside from that if you love the 50 shades series you will love these books as well.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|Simply amazing. It's a great love story and the best part is that it all feels so real. The details make you feel like part of the story.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book made me laugh and made me cry. I loved the characters, especially Enzo. He had a lot of wisdom to offer! I read through this book quickly because it was so good; and then found myself missing everyone as soon as I was done. Thanks for a great book, Mr. Stein!
B00AH8FTT2|5.0|Brilliant!  All sorts of twists, plot changes and page turning excitement.  Start at the first one and read all three.
B008RA3X5E|3.0|well I liked the different faces of the clock however its not important, I bought this version instead of the free one but I think either is ok. But the alarm didn't wake me up. I don't even think it went off. Kinda bummed about this.
B0036G1T78|4.0|They certainly do not make movies like this anymore.  A real think piece filled with good performances and suspense.  The &#34;love scene&#34; between RR and FD was, well, quaint.  It wouldn't pass muster in today's movie world.
B002UWH8P6|5.0|The show starts slow. But really picks up. It got cancelled too early. Season 2 really picks up and gets alot better.
B003QSMC18|5.0|Very funny and entertaining. It has an interesting message and is one of my favorite movies from disney. I highly recommend it
B007SGM084|5.0|LOVE THESE BOOKS! I have read them over and over again. I was a little worried about navigating through them to get to favorite parts but it is super easy....now if I can figure out the parental controls on my kindle fire so my kids don't read them!
B0054SMID0|4.0|I loved the book and liked the movie a lot.  Characters were well played.  Much better than some I've recently seen at the theater.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Great puzzles, some I really had to think about, but short. Looking forward to more chapters. Like this game quite a bit.
B004JHYRAE|5.0|With chapters on jealousy, arguments, and building healthy relationships in a polyamorous lifestyle this book is terrific.  From it I learned that I want to be and am an ethical slut, and having read the book I wear that asa a badge of pride.  If you are poly or even curious, I don't know of a better resource.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Amazingly good fun. And its not too difficult.  Can You Escape is a wonderful game to play when your bored or just have some time to kill. But the levels are limited.
B005H9B44A|4.0|This movie was great. I usually don't like movies involving marvel characters but this one was really great. I'm definitely going to see the second one in theaters when it comes out.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Love that you can store stop and start any episode so easily.  I missed so many episodes when the series started on TV it is nice to get caught up and be able to go back and see.
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|This was the first CD I have gotten of Darius and I really love his music. If you like Darius you'll really like this CD.
030746363X|4.0|I swear it's like this author was speaking directly to me in terms of what's important to me about health and fitness and the amount of work I really want to put into it. Yeah, there's one significant female-specific part but even that I've been able to leverage for some interesting stuff in a short amount time.<br />I mean he's hacking the stuff that I really want in the way that I can do it without having to do all of the heavy lifting in terms of research, trial and error, etc.<br />That is if you can trust this guy's super weird obsessions in life and assume that your body will react even remotely like his. I can't say that I'm going to do everything he did but in the book but I am trying to follow the ab, diet (especially schedule and exercise before and after eating magic) and swimming stuff he offers.<br />I think the concept of \\"minimal effective load\\" is brilliant and obviously, just someone hacking something as overwhelming and everywhere like exercise, diet and eye-pleasing fitness is pretty cool.<br />I've been trying to incorporate more cold showers and ice pack stuff which is definitely weird but not as weird as doing exercises in the men's room before eating out with my pals and on dates- it's brilliant though.<br />With all that though, I'm seeing noticeable results- which is awesome!<br />Also, the slight adjustments to typical positions have been great and I never knew about that very sensitive spot before and so a couple of my most recent dates really appreciated both new discoveries!<br />Not sure how this is going to play out long-term for me but I appreciate the effort if not the super textbook-like format and length of the book (both of which I understand for credibility reasons).<br />I say use what you want and just skip the rest you think is nonsense because no matter what, you'll see some kind of improvement for sure(even just the female biology knowledge and techniques are an easy way to justify the purchase).

B0013TXA5Y|1.0|I was looking for a series that would suck me in, captivate my attention, and leave me wanting more. That's not what I got. Granted, I'm older than the target audience, but YA novels are kind of my guilty pleasure. I will be doing you a favor when I say NOT to waste your MONEY. Trust me, you'll thank me later. I could list a million reasons why it's such a waste, but just trust me on this. It's awful. End of story.
B001R7IHA0|4.0|I'm just getting to knew Keith Urban as I singing and this CD is good! I would definitely recommend it.
B007L6VR12|3.0|The premise of this movie is good and the descriptions make it sound quite different than it really is! Star-studded. Yes. But what promised to be an enchanting story became silly and goofy. Too many things were annoying--sailboats that moved like speedboats, floods that weren't really floods, ridiculous and unbelievable people....The young stars and their trajectory was good and touching. Otherwise it was a waste of my time and $$. This seems to be one of those movies that is hyped, only to leave you feeling like a sucker for reviews.

The Chromecast connects to the wifi network, and ... that's it!<br /><br />Open your YouTube or Netflix apps on the phone, and you'll see a screen cast icon that you can click to \\"cast\\" your screen over to the Chromecast.<br /><br />Your phone now acts like a remote control, allowing you to fast forward/rewind/pause etc. on the app, and watch it reflected inreal time on the screen.<br /><br />There was absolutely no lag with either Netflix or YouTube, and I could even turn on CC for Netflix.<br /><br />Note that once your video begins playing:<br /><br />1. you can close the playing app and interact with other apps as normal<br />2. you can even turn off your phone, and the video will continue uninterrupted.<br /><br />Also note:<br /><br />The Google Cast extension for Chrome  adds a Cast icon to the top right of the browser. This lets you mirror an entire browser tab to the Chromecast. However, when I tried to mirror video the results were choppy and unwatchable - possibly due to my network's limited bandwidth.<br /><br />Overall, I have been very impressed with the stability and quality of this device. It absolutely does not feel like a version 1 product.<br /><br />Happy Streaming!
B00AHJL7BK|4.0|I used to play this game on paper years ago, but it was difficult to find on paper so I am happy to see it here. Everything seems to work great for the couple of games I played.  There is no longer a problem seeing the whole puzzle at once - I installed it on my phone and tablet and it works on both.  The pencil mark problems I saw in other reviews work fine now too.  The puzzles are solved by logic, so I don't understand criticisms there.  When I worked on these on paper, I had a cheat sheet of unique numbers for the number of squares and think that might be useful to include on the help screens.  This is what you need to solve by logic.<br /><br />Edit:<br />I erased one star because the game does not work well with multitasking in android 4.2.  I created a cheat sheet for my self in Google Keep, but when I try to switch back to the game it takes at least three taps for the game to come back.  This happens both when I hit the home button and then the Kakuro icon, and when I use the multitask button on my Nexus 7 and then try to choose the Kakuro icon there.  I tried to go back to Kakuro while writing this review to make sure it wasn't just a Google Keep issue.  It's very frustrating - I am playing a game on my tablet, but need to look at my paper number list.<br /><br />Edit 2:<br />You don't have to do three taps for the game to come back, you just need to do one tap and then wait a full 4 to 5 seconds for the screen to come back up.  Since I was only away from the screen for 10 seconds or less, that's got to be some kind of bug.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is a thorough review of Chromecast paired with:<br />- Nexus 4 running 4.2.2 Jelly Bean<br />- Windows 7 64bit PC<br /><br />I will review Chromecast based on the aforementioned devices running Netflix, Youtube, Google Play (supported apps per 07/26/2013), and several webpages.<br /><br />1) Installation: [5/5]<br />Nexus 4: Install Chromecast app from google play: [...]<br />PC: Require Google Chrome Browser and Google Cast Web Extension: [...] (not needed for Netflix and Youtube).<br />Chromecast (TV): Other than inserting your wifi password, there is no other installation.<br /><br />2) Netflix (the best app so far): [5/5]<br />Both Netflix app (on Nexus 4) and Netflix website (PC) has a native \\"Cast\\" icon build in. If you are connected to the similar wireless network to your Chromecast, both Netflix app and website will recognize it. As soon as you click the icon, the TV will turn on (if the TV was off) and it takes about 3-5 seconds for the video to start. So you do not even need to pick up your TV's remote to turn on the TV.<br />On Android: when a video is playing, there are Play/Pause, Stop, Repeat icons on your notification bar and also on your Lock screen acting like a controller to your TV. You can also control the volume from your phone. Even if you completely close the Netflix app, the video is still running, while the controller remain on the notification bar. The next time you open Netflix app, it will automatically recognize the connectivity and you can either choose another video or go to controller page.<br />On PC: pretty much similar experience with Netflix app on Android phone. You can close your chrome browser tab, and it will not disturb the video. Next time you open Netflix tab, you can control the video.<br /><br />3) Youtube: [5/5]<br />Everything is pretty much similar to Netflix. The only thing that the Android's Youtube app lacks in comparison with Netflix is that there is no Play/Pause, Stop, etc. control on the notification bar nor at the Lock Screen. However, when a video is playing, there is a still notification that will open the Youtube app.<br /><br />Other thought on Netflix and Youtube apps: I am very impressed with the 'switch-ability' between PC to Android and vice versa even between these two apps/website (Youtube and Netflix). No matter which app I opened first from either device (PC or Android), it is smart enough to \\"read\\" each other, in a way that there is almost no dis-connectivity at all between apps and devices.<br /><br />4) Google Play: [4/5]<br />On Android: there is the native \\"Cast\\" icon on both Google Play Music and Google Play TV & Movies. It only plays online content, not the local content.<br />On PC: Unlike Netflix and Youtube website, (as per today 07/26/2013) there is no native \\"Cast\\" icon on Google Play Music and on Google Play Video (which actually opens an embedded Youtube player but without \\"Cast\\" icon). However, the \\"Google Cast\\" chrome browser extension will be able to do the job for these two websites. See next discussion for more details about this extension.<br /><br />5) Mirroring from Chrome Browser \\"Google Cast\\" Extension (Beta): [4/5]<br />First of all, the mirroring is NOT similar to \\"duplicate screen\\". You can only cast a single Google Chrome's browser tab. So technically, you cannot use your TV as your alternative monitor screen, because you can't see your mouse hovering on your TV. It will only display exactly everything inside your Chrome tab. I am casting this page as I am typing, and I notice 1-2 seconds lag between my typing and what it shows on TV. As long as the cast tab is not closed, you can continue use your PC for something else.<br />I tested several websites that has a video feature and I have concluded that Chromecast video mirroring works on every websites that utilize Adobe Flash to run the audio/video; that includes:<br />- Google Play Music (play.google.com/music/listen) and TV&Movies (play.google.com/movies?hl=en)<br />- Pandora.com<br />- Play.Spotify.com<br />- Vimeo.com<br />- TheVerge.com<br />- ESPN.go.com<br />- etc.<br />Unfortunately, Amazon Instant Video is the only video website that doesn't work. I assume that Silverlight is not supported at this moment.<br />Additional note: Because there is no extension feature on Android Chrome Browser, I do not find a way to cast from Android Chrome browser.<br />[Update 07/28/2013]:<br />Local content that is supported by Chrome browser/OS can be played/cast to TV just by dragging the icon file into the active-cast Chrome tab (credit: CAC1031 and MaestroT - thank you). Here is the list of supported files: [...] While the music/video is cast to the TV via a Chrome tab, you still can watch another video or listening to another music on your PC.<br /><br />Final Thought: If there are more websites and apps that are as integrated as Netflix, this small little device can be ridiculously convenient. It works almost flawlessly between apps, across different devices. When I saw the launch demo, I found it hard to grasp how the inter-connectivity works - for they tend to use \\"marketing\\" language in this kind of demo. But lo and behold, it just works. Even though there are some imperfection on the chrome browser mirroring (beta) and inability to play local content (at least currently), I don't think it justifies a star reduction. For what it does, at this price, I would still give Chromecast 5/5.<br /><br />Thank you,<br />WP
B000OSC3GM|5.0|In 1964 two American political thrillers [[ASIN:B003BD236C Fail Safe]] staring Henry Fonda and Seven Days in May were released. These two films were probably the greatest political thrillers of the twentieth century. While Failsafe depicted an accidental nuclear Armageddon, Seven Days in May depicted the internal danger of a military coup in a highly politicized era.<br /><br />The cast of both films was impressive but the cast of this movie was monumental. Burt Lancaster portrays the highly decorated Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Kirk Douglas is a Marine colonel assigned to the Pentagon who uncovers the plot to stage a military coup. Frederick March is the President of the United States. So deep in the cast that a Juilliard professor named John Houseman in his first role in a feature film, that of a Navy Admiral who declines to participate in the putsch, is actually uncredited. It would be ten years years before his next appearance in film as Professor Charles Kingsfield in [[ASIN:B000SW4DL2 The Paper Chase]] earned him an Academy Award.<br /><br />Lancaster's performance is commanding. Cool, unflappable he pushes forward  even as the curtain concealing his scheme begins to fray. Kirk Douglas's angst is palpable as he chooses country over friendship.<br /><br />The film was directed by John Frankenheimer, a master of the thriller genre who also gave us [[ASIN:B00020X88Y The Manchurian Candidate (Special Edition)]]. Rod Serling is credited with the screenplay.
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|Amazing. I love this album, and if you love funk + electronica, you will too!<br /><br />My favorite song on the album is &#34;Touch&#34; but there are so many good songs on here, it's hard to choose!
098478280X|4.0|I used it for a high powered tech interview. I passed! But the book didn't help, I was asked completely original conceptual questions by a luminary in the field and there was no prep for it.  But, the book did decrease my anxiety on handling stupid coding questions (that only really asses whether: (1) you are a recent CS gradate, or (2) you drilled through such books). Not something creative types would do.<br /><br />The book itself has many good questions and solutions. Lost a star because the explanations ... meh, not so good, better in other books that lay it out. For it's thickness, it really should go through 5 of the sort methods, more on hashing, much more on mutex etc etc.<br /><br />Again, drilling through will enhance the probability of you getting in through some idiot mono-clonal coding interviewer IF you happen to hit their &#34;ah ha&#34; set of questions. If you don't study this crap, you can be blind sided. After awhile, you'll see that all these questions are pretty much the same: Here's a problem that has a fairly simple order(N^2) solution, code me the order(N) solution. Make fricking sure that you check for empty inputs, corner cases or else you are out. Ah, the tedium.<br /><br />I was fortunate that they took me up a level (where I in fact do better). But, I was ready for 'em if they decided to come at me this way thanks to the book.
1423140591|4.0|This is the second installment in The Heroes of Olympus series, and I have to say that I am slightly disappointed in it although it is still a four star read. First off, Percy Jackson is reintroduced to the story-line, but he remains the major player throughout the book with an inadequate portion of the story shifting focus to the new characters involved. Secondly, there were parts of this story that seemed to go by very slowly, which is very strange for a Rick Riordan book. Finally, my last complaint has to do with the gods themselves. Why are they all still being so quiet? Zeus is really starting to annoy me!<br /><br />Still, I enjoyed this book, and the characters weren't that bad overall. I think Percy got an abundance of the attention, but his cohorts were very interesting and impressed me greatly with their own unique merits. I just feel as if they are simply doomed to die in future portions of the series. I can't image their lives being extended much farther at least, and that leaves me feeling a little depressed with the conclusion of this story.<br /><br />Overall: Great addition to the series. Glad to see Percy again, and excited about the ending's possibilities. Not pleased with the entire book or the emotion it left with me, but I would still recommend this for young readers like pre-teens and other double digit bearers plus a few mature single digit readers as well.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This is indeed a great story showing the truly beautiful aspects of the human spirit under the most adverse of conditions! It's a story that everyone needs to know about.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I bought this as soon as it was announced this week. I figured for $35 and 3 free months of Netflix (at the time) how could you go wrong. I got it yesterday and I am very impressed. I downloaded the chromecast app on my Nexus phone to set it up but you can just as easily set it up from a Windows or Mac computer or tablet. It took me almost as long to open the box it as it took to set it up, just a few minutes.<br /><br />The steps to use it. From the phone/tablet just launch Netflix, YouTube or Google Play and pick a video and choose to Cast it to the TV. What happens next is what really impresses me. It not only turns on your TV but also switches the input to the proper input (HDMI1, 2 or whatever) and starts playing. At that point you can use your device however you'd like while the video plays as its not dependent on the source device at all. If you want to stop, ffwd, rewind or whatever just launch the app and it will show you the controls to do so. YouTube allows you to queue up as many videos as you'd like which it will play in succession. I primarily use it from my Nexus but have tested with an old iPhone and it works great there too. Had a friend over yesterday and we were loading the YouTube queue simultaneously from my Nexus and his iPhone.<br /><br />If you'd like to Cast from your browser launch Chrome and download the plugin available in the Chrome Store then all you do is press the icon in the right hand corner of the screen and your browser tab will show up on the TV.<br /><br />Its so easy to use you almost forget its there. Its a very natural extension of using your tablet or phone and the videos looked great. HD YouTube looks amazing.<br /><br />These apps give you a good deal to watch as it is but they have already said more are on the way.  In addition they have a software developers kit out there so any developer can add this casting functionality to their app on any Apple iOS or Android device.  Possibilities could be endless.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|The origional, upgraded and better than ever, rocking on Bluray.  A great series and a worth addition to my collection.
B000FGGE7C|4.0|Aside from the do-nothing little brat in this movie, this is an action packed performance by Milla. It's worth the money.
B005F2BBLK|5.0|Funny, entertaining, the kids loved it.  I even liked it, but I think I like most of these pixtar animated films.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|After a slow beginning, this was the best of the three novels that I have read in the series so far.
B005VPRETE|5.0|this was a gift for my daughter for Christmas. She loved it and all of the Friends sets by Legos.
B000002LGQ|5.0|In my opinion, this is the best CD Madonna has ever put out.  Every song is a good one! Well worth the money.
B005WTR4ZI|4.0|There isn't really any new revelations in this book. What they have done is point out several of the things we take for granted and offer a different way to consider them. I read this book as a spin-off from an article and overall I'm glad I did.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Amazing book i recommend it strongly it really was awesome please down load it it really good get it now
B00B89WXYS|5.0|I chose this album after hearing it at my daughter's one day.  I liked the sound, the uplifting music and the notes heard throughout.  It's no different now.  I quite enjoy the album and love it for what it is - good, solid, rock music with a folk sound.  If you like One Republic, I don't have to tell you to get it.  It's one of their best.
B00D37UQ1K|4.0|Very few books are translated to screen well, but this is an exception.  This was a solidly written, acted, and produced adaptation.  A worthwhile watch.
B004JRVQX0|4.0|Pro Tools still uses the dumb things so I do too.  It works fine.  It's usefulness seems to be losing ground to online authorization.  This may be the last version.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|So much fun and quite addicting. I play on my and now my kindle too!!! I play literally every day.
B0090SI56Y|1.0|The Wolverine has a great concept -- an X-Men Wolverine installment that takes place in Japan. Unfortunately, the script, actors and direction all fall prey to standard Hollywood stereotypes and cliches. All the Japanese people in this movie are over-acted and caricatures of the Western conception of what Japanese people are like. Except, they're not. Anyone who's been to Japan would be disgusted and disappointed with the low-quality unrealistic portrayal of Japanese people. Leave it to Hollywood to make some of the smartest people in the world, the Japanese, look dumb, brutish, petty and stupid. Only Hollwood can so successfully demean people. Not to mention provide way over-the-top unrealistic impossible action scenes such as the fight on top of the speeding bullet train. Some of the Japanese scenery and architecture was beautiful, but even there the producers failed to capture the essence of Japan and what it means to be Japanese. The acting and script were just monumentally stupid. But I'm sure millions of dumb Americans will just love this. The first Wolverine installment was awesome and since then they've gotten progressively worse. This was the worst, and it's a shame, because X-Men movies should all be awesome.
B00DP3IGJ6|2.0|Lack luster performances, poor script, just plain old boring...I wanted to like this, but beyond what could have been an interesting storyline, there was nothing worthwhile to see here.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I like the new app,very hard to get use to,but I love getting points for checking it out..the only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars is the pop-up ads,,they are annoying..I know that they need sponsors but really that is over kill..maybe when it's a little older your can get some of the bugs worked out OR I will learn to use it better..LOL
B001V5CIFI|5.0|My kids love this movie. It just seems that our internet is too slow for good quality streaming. Netflix seems to be so much better...
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Well I thought the book was really good in some parts and just weird in others. But overall very good.
