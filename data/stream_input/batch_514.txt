B000003TA4|4.0|Nirvana would go on to be huge international rock stars after the release of their second album \\"Nevermind\\", the album was much more pop oriented then their previous release \\"Bleach\\". Kurt Cobain had a knack for writing catchy pop tunes that would stick in the listener's head. This cannot be labeled a true grunge album along the lines of Mudhoney and the Melvins, but it's catchy and crossed over into the mainstream. \\"Nevermind\\" topped Garth Brooks, C&C Music factory, and Michael Jackson, which was big news back in 1991. A small punk band from Aberdeen became the biggest rock stars almost overnight, creating an almost unwanted fame that would ultimately be the demise of the band. If you are looking for a grunge album , you should pick up their last release \\"In Utero\\" which is much more raw.  \\"Nevermind\\" will stand the test of time because it's just a great rock record, plus it's catchy as hell.  All the hits were on this album, so buy and you want be disappointed.
B000002GBB|5.0|I love this album. There are no bad songs on it. Like the Grand Illusion and Crystal Ball, this is a little short. That is why they created Chronicles. This does remind me a little of Cyclorama. I would base that on the last song, \\"Aku-Aku\\", that is basically a relaxing song.It's what you'd hear when you step into a little Asian Cuisine. This album is a nice one to stick on the shuffle function on an iPod.
B00004STDN|1.0|worst opening sequence of a movie ever conceived..you kill off a female character in the first 10 minutes...and she didn't even do anything to deserve it?! The only way to do this movie justice would be to parody...oops, been there done that.
B000A6T1KE|2.0|What is it with destroying the Enterprise in the TNG franchise?  They seem to treat her like a damn Yugo: cheap and easily replaceable.  Borrowing liberally from its own past, this film demonstrates how tired the franchise has become.  Not that we're tired of the characters, but they obviously need new direction.  There is no spirit of discovery left.  Berman and company have bled the turnip dry.   At least with the TOS films there seemed to be a desire to move the characters forward, despite the obvious and necessary commercial ambitions of the movies.  Berman seems content with just holding a record for spin-offs.  They tried to make this their Star Trek II with a black hat villain and heroic sacrifice in the end, but there's no emotional connection.  It's all too fantastic to believe.
0064407667|5.0|do not let the childish looks of this seemingly small book mislead you,it is written in a very smart way at a level that both children and adults will enjoy.While the book was unfortunately predictable I couldn't stop myself from reading chapter after chapter.I highly recommend this book for everyone  who is thirsting for great literature.
B000084T18|1.0|This whole \\"gangsta rap\\" craze is a major disgrace. As much as I hate Eminem, at least his lyrics sometimes mean something. 50's don't mean nothin'. Okay, you're gangsta, we understand, we've had this whole \\"I'm a Gangsta\\" thing shoved down our throats for the past decade, and frankly, it's CRAP. Gangsta rap is worthless - I wouldn't touch it.
B000001DTM|5.0|This was one of the first mainstream albums that succeeded on mixing rock and electronica. After releasing one of the best albums of the 80's, U2 found what was looking for. They saw the fall of communism and the beginning of a new era, so they did an album for those changing times.    The easiest thing to do for U2 was to make Joshua Tree Part 2 after the failure of Rattle & Hum. However, they tried a change in their style, not in their substance and the result is clear: techno rock with a message.     \\"One\\" is one of the best ballads from the 90's and maybe the one with the best lyrics from U2. \\"Ultra violet\\" and \\"Acrobat\\" are the best examples of the new style that U2 adopted, and there are echoes of this album in U2's latter works.    Achtung Baby hasn't aged a bit. It is an avant garde album as much as it was the year it was released. A few years from now, this album will be on the same league of Led Zeppelin's IV, Metallica's Master of Puppets, Nirvana's Nevermind or Dylan's Highway 61 Revisited. It will be remembered as an album that helped to shape the form of music in the last decade of the 20th century.
0064407667|5.0|In this book we are introduced to the three Baudelaire orphans-Violet, Klaus and Sunny. All of them have three very different talents. Violet, the eldest, has a knack for inventing things, even out of useless junk. Klaus, the middle child, is an avid researcher and is very intelligent. And let's not forget Sunny, the baby, who has four teeth as sharp as a shark's and fancies biting hard things. All of them are inventing, researching and biting things up until the day the Baudelaire mansion is distroyed by a terrible fire, along with their dear parents. So, they are sent to live with a distant relative...Count Olaf. He's a short-tempered, demanding, smelly man with a pig-sty of a house. The only good thing to be said towards Olaf is that he spends most of his time up in the Tower, leaving the children lumpy gray oatmeal to eat before doing hard, laborous chores. They discover that Count Olaf is after their parent's large fortune, which Violet is to recieve when she comes of age, and nothing more. His awful tasks include cooking dinner for his theater troupe, chopping wood and doing everything else that pops into his head. Okay, I enjoyed this story immensely! Lemony Snicket's humorous narrating is quite pleasing. Count Olaf is a perfect madman, and the three orphans are quite intelligent with pleasent facial features. If you have a dubious attitude towards \\"Happily Ever After\\", this might just be your writing style. Unbeliveably more enjoyable and funny than Harry Potter. THE END
B00005NNMJ|5.0|Simply this is one of the best Metal Albums out there...Contrary to what some of the reviews report, this album does not sound dated and Accept is not an AC/DC clone band... There are no \\"throwaway\\" tracks on Balls to the Wall...This album rocks from beginning to end...If I was stranded on a desert island and could only have one Metal album...this would be it.  One thing though...Can't stand the Album cover...
B000002U82|5.0|I began listening to rock music in 1992 by accident.  Ironically, I ordered Extreme II Pornograffiti in early 1992 (I didn't know that Extreme was a rock band) from Columbia House Music Club and got Metallica ...And Justice for All by mistake, an incident that, to this day, changed how I would look at music forever.  I first heard tracks of Dark Side of the Moon on KKZR in Houston, not realizing at the time that it was Pink Floyd.  I really liked \\"Money\\", and was always curious who sang it and which album it was on, I didn't find out until 1999 when I bought the album, and realized that I, not knowingly, I had heard almost every song.  Believe it or not, this was not the first Pink Floyd album I purchased.  I originally got into Pink Floyd around 1996, when I first watched The Wall (in my opinion, the most breathtaking rock movie ever filmed), I bought the double cassette set of The Wall in June 1996 while on vacation in Colorado, and over the next several weeks I  listened to it constantly.  I would give anything to see the original lineup in concert, as I never went to see them when I'd had the chance to so long ago. <br /> <br />I suggest this album to anyone (like is mentioned in other reviews) who has never listened to Pink Floyd (you'll probably figure out that you have and just didn't know it yet).
B0009MDPYM|2.0|The American consumer public are no fools. We know how to spend our dollars wisely, where to invest and what to avoid. So when this Francis Lawrence-helmed apocalyptic \\"thriller\\" topped weekend box office charts during its initial release, there's no way that money could've been directed towards the wrong feature, right? <br /> <br />Yes and no. Let's start with the yes and get it over with. First off, very impressive visual effects. From the exorcism in the beginning of the movie, to our little hero's ventures into hell, to the wings of Gabriel. (Btw, it is very interesting to note how Gabriel is depicted as genderly ambiguous) Rachel Weisz has a very smooth way to her acting, as if she can do it so easily and flawlessly, you actually believe her character as an L.A. policewoman haunted by the mysterious death of her twin sister. Shia Laboeuf has a bit of a minor role, but he makes the most of it, shining with that unintended humor of his character, Constantine's \\"slave\\" chaffeur, Chas Kramer. <br /> <br />Now, the no part. Hollywood seems to love declaring Keanu Reeves as our savior, the hero who didn't want to be a hero, called upon to save the world in one way or another. Whether it be in the machine-run era of \\"The Matrix\\", or a police officer trying to stop a madman from doing terrorist deeds in \\"Speed.\\" And now, again, Reeves is called upon to save us from a clash between heaven and hell! John Constantine, a reluctant hero who has selfish ends, feeling sorry for himself, blah blah... Reeves may or may not put his all into this role, but as we all know by now, his best is never good enough. Constantine's persona is too flat, not captivating enough, further brought down by that annoying monotone drawl of Reeves' voice, and constantly needs support from the other characters in the film. Even the 20-second flashbacks of his childhood we see aren't enough to garner attention or pity for this soul branded for hell. <br /> <br />The worst of it is that we expect this hero to maintain and carry along what little plot there is, stretched out over 2 hours. Honestly, folks, there is not much going on here. The filmmakers probably made about 5 storyboards and decided to make each one 20 minutes long. Inbetween the grueling beginning and the much-anticipated end, there's a whole lot of nothing eye-candy that manages to transfix into a bit of something, but not enough. Somehow we get from the death of a psychiatric patient to the end of the world...? And even when the movie's over, there's STILL unanswered questions. I don't mean, \\"Oh, will Angela and John get together?\\" nonsense but \\"Uh what happened to the dead sister??\\" No doubt saving for an equally painful sequel. <br /> <br />So don't waste your money on this over-budgeted Keanu-promoting campaign...oh, oh I mean, thriller! \\"The Seventh Seal,\\" \\"12 Monkeys,\\" good flicks. Not this. No.
B0007TKH66|5.0|No not of the Enterprise, I am referring to the hostile take over of Paramount. They continue to market the most overpriced SciFi series of all. All the Star Treks are good, it is the company that owns them that is bad. Most SciFi series are under $60 for a season. Only Paramount tries to milk about double that out of any fans of their series.
B0009RCPY8|4.0|A number of years back, when the Ghostbusters movies were finally released on DVD, I missed out on them. With this release, I've finally got two of my favorite movies in my collection. The movies, as always, are wonderful, and a apooky laugh a minute.  However, this two-pack has something the previous one didn't have; a small scrapbook on the making of the movies, and two episodes of the animated Ghostbusters series, which I loved as a kid.      The two episodes are: \\"Citizen Ghost\\", a first-season episode which details the events following the first movie, and \\"Partners in Slime\\", an episode from the short-lived \\"Slimer! and the Real Ghostbusters\\" spinoff series, in which Louis Tully and Janine are kidnapped by Poso, the Ghostfather, who wants the GB operation turned over to his control, forcing the guys to enlist the reluctant cooperation of one of Poso's ghouls from inside the containment unit and a bucket of the psychoreactive slime from \\"Ghostbusters II\\" dumped over Venkman to give him some supernatural powers, to save their friends.    Personally, I thought \\"Citizen Ghost\\" was a great choice for the DVD set, as it picked up right where the first movie ended, though I would've gone with something else for the second choice. Exactly which episode, I'm not sure, but it's because of \\"Partners in Slime\\" that I've rated this at four stars.    What I want to know is when are they going to release ALL of \\"The Real Ghostbusters\\" on DVD?  I'll be first in line to buy it, as it was one of my top faves when I was young.    And while we're talking \\"Ghostbusters\\", it would be foolish of anyone to not see the fanfilm \\"Freddy vs Ghostbusters\\", made by a group of people in Denver, in which Freddy Krueger has been terrorizing a new city, including the dreams of a new guy who becomes a Ghostbuster with Egon's nephew Ed Spengler, and Ed's friend Eugene.  The FX in this fanfilm are virtually identical to the 'real' movies, and though short, (and Freddy admittedly could've been better) this fanfilm embraces the spirit, pardon the pun, of the Ghostbusters movies, with the same type of dry humoer amid supernatural terror. They are now working on a sequel.    (...)  You might want to sit back and enjoy the Ghostbusters 'trilogy'!
B0001HAISG|5.0|This film captures all of the magic, wonder and adventure that all other versions have lacked in one way or the other.  <br /> <br />It is a wondrful companion/follow-up piece to Finding Nerverland and will compel you to \\"follow the second star to the right, straight on till morning\\" no matter your age or \\"maturity\\" level.  <br /> <br />For those who aren't grown-up, who never grew-up, those who never want to grow-up or those who have grown-up but need reminding that maybe it's not all it's cracked up to be. And if, after seeing this, someone accuses you of having a Peter Pan complex you can look them right in the face and say \\"Thank you!\\"  <br /> <br />Highly Recommended! <br />
0446677450|4.0|I felt uneasy with the book and upon closer self examination, I realised I did not like the author's strategy of property investments. However, I think he has an excellent understanding of the mindset/philosophy of the ultra rich entrepreneur/investor. The fact that he is himself ultra rich speaks of this fact.     I read The Millionaire Next Door and its philosophy for crossing the million dollar mark. I agree it is possible for people to become millionaires by working hard and saving if and only if they start saving at a very young age and nothing drastic (incurring costs) happens to them or their families in the course of their working life. Even so, they can only become a millionaire perhaps at retirement, I doubt they will become ultra rich multi-millionairs. I think we should differentiate the kind of \\"rich\\" people under discussion when we want to critique \\"Rich dad poor dad\\".      I think Rich Dad Poor Dad paints an accurate picture of an ultra rich man grooming his son (Mike) to take over his business. I would be more at ease if Mike had written the book. The philosophy of Rich Dad is old and traditional. In today's context, I'm not sure if some of these believes still hold. I would like to read a similar book written by the son of Bill Gates!     I am more inclined to prefer Rich Dad Poor Dad to The Millionaire Next Door. Philosophically speaking, we live life only once and what is the point of becoming a millionaire next door when I have to save and forgo pleasures that make life meaningful?
B0009RCPY8|5.0|I loved these movies as a kid growing up, and I still like to watch them.  The first film is excellent, and while the second one is still a mild disapointment it is nice to have a 2-Disc set with both films together.  But it would have been nice to get some more or new extra features (the cartoon episodes aren't interesting), but at this low price I'm not complaining.
0312323859|5.0|First of all, it is extremely important to read Emily Giffin's \\"Something Borrowed,\\" in order to understand \\"Something Blue.\\" In the earlier book, we see things from Rachel's perspective but in \\"Something Borrowed,\\" we see things from Darcy's perspective. After disovering that her fiance, Dex had cheated on her with her best friend, Rachel, Darcy was determined to move on and proved that Dex had made the wrong decision. At the same time, we also learned of how Darcy cheated on Dex with his groomsman, Marcus and she became pregnant as a result of that. It was all quite complicated and it became worse when Marcus did not want to have anything to do with either Marcy or the baby. Feeling that everyone had betrayed her, Darcy determined to start all over again in London, and bunk in with her childhood friend, Ethan. However, Darcy learned that it was not going to be as easy as she thought.  <br /> <br />In \\"Something Blue,\\" we learned a lot more of Darcy's character, that she was spoilt, self-centered, shallow and at the same time whiny. Even though Darcy is all that, the author was able to present the character in such a way that you won't despise her. It's great that after reading these two books, you get two opposing perspectives and realized that both characters are truly flawed but definitely very \\"real.\\" Rachel, we learned in the earlier book was envious of Darcy because Darcy was the pretty one, and guys flocked to her. Darcy, on the other hand, was jealous of Rachel's intelligence. This is definitely one of the better chick-lit books. It was well-written, and the characters were very \\"real\\" and definitely very vividly described. Definitely worth your time and effort.
0141301120|3.0|The book basically can be divided into two parts, part one is in space and part two is once they are actually back at the factory.  The first half was incredibly painfull to read through.  Aside from Charlie, Grandpa Joe and Willy Wonka, every other character in first half needed to be smacked over the head with a bag of nickles.  When they finally got to the factory, I was hoping we'd see a lot more that wasn't on the tour, or at least to see charlie learning how to run the factory.  But instead we have to once again save the grandparents who have screwed up again.  I recommend you read it just for the simple fact that it does follow Charlie after he wins the factory, but I wouldn't recommend reading it ever again, or even thinking about it if possible.
6305311463|1.0|Because Zero Stars is not an option.  This film is garbage in the Criterion Collection.  I cannot understand why Criterion would put Michael Bay's run-of-the-mill hollywood brainless summer blockbuster movies (Yes they even took on \\"The Rock\\") on the same page as Fellini, Renoir, Goddard, Hitchcock, Bergman, etc.  This is an insult to film as art (which I thought Criterion was dedicated to).  And I'm not pretentious, I'm just stating the obvious.  Why does Criterion pick up this movie and not other recent movies much more worthy of the Criterion label--Paul Thomas Anderson's movies for example (esp. Magnolia)?  Or even Darren Aronofsy's work (esp. Pi)?  The list goes on...  this is ridiculous!
6305558167|4.0|Excalibur is a beautifully filmed version of the Legend of King Arthur and Merlin.  Boorman produced the film on a limited budget and without the use of a wide variety of digital effects--few of which were available in 1980.  Nigel Terry gives a remarkable performance as Arthur.  He effectively portrays Arthur from a gawkey bumbling teenager to the mature Arthut with in a very convincing manner.  I had some reservations about this transformation as we met the young Arthur, but was very comfortable with his maturity as the film progressed.  In the end, he produced a portrait of King Arthur worthy of the legend.  Helen Mirren, Nicholas Clay and Nichole Williamson were supurb in their supporting roles.  Paul Geoffrey was especially effective in his portrayal of Sir Percival; again showing his acting ability in growing into a brave but caring Knight of thr Round Table.  Patrick Stewart(of Star Trek fame) and Clive Swift (of Keeping Up Appearances fame) were well cast in their roles.  Boorman's choice of misic was particularly interesting since some of it was drawn from such composers as Wagner and Carl Orff in addition to original music by Trevor Jones.  All in all it was a delightful feast for the eyes.
B0001XAS1M|5.0|A complicated question ... but I think a sound argument can be made that this it ... simply mesmerizing work. Could not begin to say how many copies of this album I've burned through, lost, had stolen, traded ... whatever ... Loaf and Steinman ought to send me thank you notes. The complete classic album ... I can say this, and absolutely know its true: I know every word to every song on this album ... and probably know many others that can say the same thing. That ...  is living testament to a fine, fine piece of work. The most perplexing thing about this album is Todd Rungren ... the dude puts out, what, a zillion who gives a flip albums ... I mean most of them are true yawners not even worthy of mention ... but that little notation \\"all guitars by Todd Rungren\\" on this album is simply stunning ... The dude, for one solid, complete album ... literally rewrote classic rock guitar work. C'mon ... anyone ... I dare ya ... track for track ... has anyone ever ... EVER ... laid down a finer line of work than Rungren, Meatloaf and Steinman ... This album ROCKS!!!
B0000683DH|5.0|In short, STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN, was the best of all the Star Trek movies.  More importantly, WRATH OF KHAN was a vast improvement over its predacessor STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE.  MOTION PICTURE was eagerly awaited by fans.  The camera work and special affects were works of art.  In fact, many reviews commented that STTMP was a beautiful film with a lame plot.<br /><br />WRATH OF KHAN corrected the shortcomings of the first film.  The interior of the Enterprise, which was white and sterile in the first movie, took on a little more contrast in KHAN. Star Fleet uniforms definitely improved moving from the STTMP's pajamas to something more military. We also were able to see phasers, photon torpedoes (only one was fired in STTMP), and transporters.<br /><br />More importantly, WRATH OF KHAN is a combat story with lots of action.  Actor Ricardo Montalban reprised his 1960s role as the genetically improved warrior Khan.  Not only is it good to see an additional familiar face from the classic Trek years, Khan is a unique character in that although he is Kirk's nemesis, he could quite as easily have been his best friend.<br /><br />The DVD director's edition of WRATH OF KHAN is vastly superior to the previous VHS releases.  Additionally, this version contains footage that has not been seen since WRATH OF KHAN premiered on the ABC Sunday Night Movie in the mid 1980s.  The restored sound and James Horner music is terrific.<br /><br />Special features also include interviews with Nicholas Meyer, William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, and Ricardo Montalban.  None of the features include any interviews with Kirstie Alley -- even though this was the film that introduced her to movie audiences.  Quite possibly there are still some hard feelings with Kirstie's salary demand -- denied, of course -- during negotiations for Star Trek III.<br /><br />Also interesting is a DVD chapter devoted to the special effects.  WRATH OF KHAN benefited greatly from lessons learned during STAR WARS: THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK. On the other hand, some of the special effects were pathetically elementary.<br /><br />Great to see WRATH OF KHAN in widescreen.  This a film that cannot be fully enjoyed on a 13-inch television screen.  Go for 27-inch or larger to get the full effect of the battle scene.  On the other hand, you could simply move closer to the TV screen.other hand, some of the special effects were pathetically elementary.    Great to see WRATH OF KHAN in widescreen.

B000002HAJ|5.0|Robert Smith certainly did well to take advantage of the larger medium for recording time on an album.  At 12 tracks long, with a great many slow-moving, powerful songs mixed in between those fast-paced little numbers, this album is a must have for any Cure fan.  The organization of the album is spectacular.  If anyone wants an essential Cure CD, a Greatest Hits may even dissappoint, compared to this album.
0887306667|5.0|This book is great because it shows the \\"laws\\" of marketing and the results when companies follow or break them.  Many of the laws seem counter-intuitive, but that reflects the complexity of business, human nature and the marketplace.   <br /> <br />Marketing is based on emotions, perception and reaction.  Because of that, it's very difficult to plan marketing strategy based on past sales figures.  It's much easier to quantify the results.  Unfortunately, by the time one quantifies the results, it can be too late.  The authors specifically point out when and why it's best to invest in professional marketing services.  <br /> <br />Each law of marketing in this book is explained in useful, real-world context, with specific examples.  It's a handy, explanatory reference.
0790733226|4.0|This film adaptation of Carl Sagan's novel \\"Contact\\" emphasizes the very few things wrong with the story, while skipping or bastardizing the elements that made it great. In order to fully understand the poverty of this film adaptation, one needs to know more than a little bit about Carl Sagan. Dr. Sagan was an astronomer with a well thought out and unwavering view of what NASA should be about. He lobbied for the terra-forming of Mars as early as 1972. Four 02 machines, and 25 years, would produce a noticeable atmosphere on the Red planet. Another quarter century would produce an environment still very hostile to humankind, but sophisticated \\"space suits\\" would enable the few colonists (Engineers, Scientists) working there, to prepare Mars for permanent inhabitants. Mars is rich in gympsum, and thus few tools would be needed to erect permanent structures from the strong yet malleable rock. By the year 2042 - a mere 75 years after the start date - Mars would be able to support human life fairly easily. No special gear or out-fitting would be needed. People could tolerate the atmosphere wearing nothing but \\"street clothes\\" for several hours a day. People would probably carry a small 02 unit to combat any shortness of breath. Mars would be Earth-like and able to support human life by 2070. Perhaps man will learn from our mistakes on Earth and not rape the planet, or make war.  <br /> <br />Carl Sagan was also a politician. Genuine and enthusiastic, but not very effective. The scientific community tapped him to argue Evolution vs. Creationism with a team of debaters who trained in San Diego at the Creationism Institute. These debaters rehearsed with an IF-THEN approach to counter anything Sagan said. Sagan tried to bridge the gap between science and religion in a manner respectful to all points of view. He had underestimated the religous zealots, and thus, walked away from these public debates having appeared to be weak, ill-prepared, slow, confusing, and unconvincing. He made the same errors when testifying in front of Congress for additional funds for space exploration. His battles with NASA were highly publicized, and NASA looked as weak as him. He had a love/hate relationship with NASA in that he disagreed with their plans, but understood tha NASA was the only game in town. He died a slow agonizing death shortly before the film came out, and gave it a very tacid thumbs up. For all his love, all his work, he passed having realized none of his funding attempts and was ultimately one of the saddist people of the 20th c. <br /> <br />THE FILM: Ellie Arroway (\\"Sparks\\") brought to life by Jodie Foster, never met her mother as she had died at Ellie's birth. Her father died when she was 9. Ellie raced through High School, College, and Graduate school, and turned down Fellowship after Fellowship to devote her life to SETI. There is a lot of poetry here: Ellie's mother dying from childbirth is visualized by the tunnel-like Black Holes she travels through during her personal space odyssey. Her fathers caution that she'll need to take small steps to realize her frontier. And small steps she took during her quest. <br /> <br />Ellie and her Research Assistants - one of whom is blind and thus able to hear nuances sighted people may miss - eventually receive radio signals that are sophistcated and repetitive. Not products of randomness. She had resorted to begging Billionaires for funds to continue her effort, and now it was paying off. They had made Contact. A message millions of pages long comes to NASA's computers in the form of unfinished diagrams, symbols of apparent mathematics, and endless blogs of HTML-like instructions. Nothing seems to fit together. A reclusive Billionarre tells Ellie to \\"think like a Vegan.\\" She puts the pages together in a three dimensional format and finds the primer that enables her and the other scientists to read a message, get instructions, from another world. <br /> <br />Palmer Joss: this unnecessary tokenreligous character seems to have been inserted itno the film only to provide gratuitous nudity. Played by handsome Matthew Mc Coughnehy, this man of the cloth character serves only to interrupt the seamlessness of the film while spouting profound revelations, and presenting Ellie with a dichotomous love interest. This character sucks. <br /> <br />After Congressional inquests during which Ellie is villified for being atheist; after a horrific act of terror by a religous zealot that kills the character nicely played by Tom Skerrit, Ellie becomes the traveler. Propelled through the universe by entering the fore-mentioned tunnels, Ellie meets a person who appears to be her father. The alien admits he has taken the appearence and persona of her father to make it easier on her. <br />\\"Small steps Sparks. Small steps.\\" \\"This is how its been done for billions of years\\". Ellie returns with a story no one believes. A very lo-tech device aboard the capsule confirms her story, but remains a secret. A secret to everyone but Ellie.
B00092ZL80|5.0|WOW!!!  Having grown up with both of these groups and having been a fan for many years, I was very excited that they joined their talents for a fun, energizing and entertaining video.

068987474X|5.0|Women do not usually hold out for men who show them zero interest, so what's happening in the examples in this book is that the men are routinely showing patterns of pursuit and retreat that are leaving the women frustrated, angry, and confused. The motives behind pursuit/ retreat are never fully explained here and I think might be more complicated than Greg Behrendt lets on. Could the reasons be that men are trying to grab back some of the power they feel they have been losing? I don't know, but I do know that women still feel undervalued. We've been able to leave behind the lack of respect, attention, and love that women felt in the powerless role of the housewife so that we could establish some power and control in the working world. Yet many of us still feel a lack of respect, attention, and love in our personal lives. <br />As Liz Truccillo writes in this book, it is very difficult to assume a passive role in the dating world when you don't assume that role in any other area of life. If you think you have a shot, however small, at the job, house, or lifestyle that you want, you go for it. Being passive leads to depression; being active leads to a sense of empowerment, even when you lose. When have you ever heard someone advise a male to be happy with his life, with or without a partner, and to just let things happen as they may? That he should be fully satisfied with or without a love relationship? Men are never told this. I don't think most of them would have much interest in pursuing careers if they knew it would result in zero chance for relationships. We are largely driven by love and sex, after all. Yet women are consistently told they should be happy alone if the right relationship doesn't come along. So many men have complained to me that women hold all the cards in relationships; they seem to have no idea how frustrating it is to have to communicate indirectly instead of just being able to ask someone out and letting the chips fall where they may. <br />I really enjoyed the fact that we get some of the female perspective in this book; Truccillo is not afraid to air her fear and anger over these issues. No wonder Sex and the City was such a consistently good show (until the last episode) and left so many of us feeling bereft when it ended. Unfortunately, a lot of single women in their thirties and forties have so much buried fear and anger over their status that they are unable to articulate and accept their emotions on these issues. New York women are just so kick-ass. <br />Despite my misgivings, this book DID help me close a door on an unresolved relationship. It does empower you to be active in one sense-- you can actively close the door on one relationship and then actively put yourself in situations where you can meet someone new. Two other relationship-oriented, Amazon quick-picks I'd like to recommend are: Kissing in Manhattan by David Schickler and THE LOSERS CLUB: Complete Restored Edition by Richard Perez, about an addiction to personal ads, actually quite funny.
B0009IOR6Q|3.0|I saw the movie Cry Baby with all of its scenes included on IFC years ago. They did a John Waters back to back marathon. I'm glad I had taped it because since then I have never seen the movie with those seens included. For instance, you don't see Johnny getting chased by the policeman on the way to the charm school. These parts are cut out to save time. If you ever get the chance to see it with ALL of the scenes, watch it! It's better, I think. And the part where Traci Lord's character tells exchange student Inga about American boys is great. It's better with the extra scenes. Once you see it, you'll see what I mean.
B0009QTS1M|4.0|\\"Gladiator,\\" conqueror of the Oscars, returns for another ovation Aug. 23 in an \\"extended edition\\" three-disc set.<br /><br />Star Russell Crowe makes his debut as a DVD commentator, looking back at the globe-trotting production with his pal and director Ridley Scott. Their talk is spirited and informative, light on the Roman history and heavy on production anecdotes. The men seem to be having a great time, especially when busting on co-star \\"Joaq\\" Phoenix, a nervous Nellie during filming.<br /><br />Crowe rides Scott about his late-in-the-game decision to have the hero killed off: \\"It's cost us hundreds of millions of dollars. Great idea, mate! We could have been on 'Gladiator 10' by now.\\"<br /><br />Scott points out some of the new scenes, which add 17 minutes to the film. \\"People who have enjoyed this movie in its short form, they're going to like the hell out of this.\\"<br /><br />The new-to-DVD extras sprawl across discs 2 and 3. Among the best is a new documentary that, unbelievably, rarely drags over its three-hour running time. A must-see chapter is \\"The Heat of the Battle,\\" about staging the warfare. It captures director Scott making battlefield decisions: \\"I need something really brutal. Chop his f---ing head off.\\"<br /><br />A 25-minute segment covers the curious tale of Oliver Reed, who died three weeks before the end of production. The visual effects team shows how their digital resurrection of the actor averted $26 million in reshoots. Reed talks about the film on-set, looking hardy and engaged.<br /><br />Widescreen visuals on a DreamWorks test disc were first-rate, as they were on the first DVD, released in 2000. The aspect ratio is 2.35:1. Alas, the generous audio options on the original disc, such as DTS ES, have been reduced to a Dolby Digital 5.1 track.

One can't help but wonder how much Dino DeLaurentis had to do with this. Yes, it's that bad. Uber Stud Muffin Brad Pitt struts and glares and smolders and generally adds to the charge of \\"defamation of character\\" for calling himself an actor.

0007197918|5.0|I was recommended this book by a number of different people, young and old. I found this book had me laughing and crying and I couldn't put it down. Regardless of whether it's her first book it was a fantastic read....an emotional rollercoaster!
B0009H1CKG|5.0|This is the best George Clinton DVD concert to date. I also own the Mothership connection DVD and the Live at the House of Blues DVD, and this one tops them both. There was probably a little less emphasis on the guitarists than I'm used to, but the vocalists, arrangements, new musicians, intensity and the return of Bernie Worrel more than made up for that. As usual, the seamless flow of one mode into another was matchless. Without much fanfare, the entire personnel on stage could change in a moment. Even the MC got to get himself \\"some\\" on the P-Funk rendition of \\"A Whole Lotta Shakin'\\" which literally rocked. The female vocalist were fine and appropriately nasty, as were their predecessors, Lynn Mabry and Dawn Silva. The electric violin version of \\"Maggot Brain\\" will be talked about for years to come. The show is constantly changing as it remains the same as in \\"Look out here I come, right back where I started from.\\"
B0000AQS0F|5.0|So SciFi says 'yes' to every horrible monster/mutant/alien/ghost movie out there, but 'no' to this series.  It is a crime.  Watch this series.  NOW!  And watch the movie (Serenity) on Sept. 30th.  Oh, and then pray with the rest of us that the movie does so well that they HAVE to bring the series back.
B000089RVX|5.0|what is wrong with some people these days, i didnt have a favourite band until evanescence came along, and i LOVE them. screw all you people who rekon they're crap, you obviously dont know good music when you hear it. as for calling it pop/rock/ get rid of the pop and just call it rock, i do agree however that it is not gothic rock, as none of the members are actually goths. now for all those people who compare them to linkin park, wtf are you listening to? there is no way in hell that evanescence is anything like linkin park, did you hear any rap (other than bring me to life), any screaming vocals? NO. so u can forget the linkin park comparisons. There is not one track on this album that is crap, but my favourites have to be haunted and whisper, hello is another great track. i could be here forever saying how great this band is. oh yeh and amy's vocals are just the best, how she incorporates emotion into the singing it's GREAT.
B00030590I|4.0|I bought this DVD somewhat sight unseen and was very pleased that I did. I would have liked to rate it at very nearly 5 stars but sadly that is not an option. There are very few detractors here but I must be honest. I found at some points that the visuals were sometimes so intense that they overshadowed the complexities of the plot. This is at once a complement and a curse. To do something so well that you have reached the highest level. This actually paralells an underlying message in this film- once a warrior reaches the highest level of mastery he is no longer a warrior. He actually becomes the peacemaker.  <br /> On one level the visuals are stunning. The action scenes and romantic undertones are very well played. All of the parts are played with a subtlety that is hard to match. <br /> On another level there is a political message which the communist government would like to deliver to Taiwan. \\"A unified China is more important than selfish individual pusuits\\". This may be why such a restrictive regime would endorse the project in the first place. <br /> On a deeper level there is a message which comes accross as something quite the opposite of that mentioned above. It seems almost subliminal but it is best expressed by the image of a man standing fast in the path of a Tank. He is at first dwarfed by the metal monster but in the end it is the tank that yields. That this selfless act of faith can overcome the powers of destruction is the central idea in most visions of the highest human ideals. <br /> This movie can indeed be viewed on more than one level. If you are one to analyze and ponder the deeper messages there is plenty to keep you occupied here. If you just want a movie that will sweep you off your feet and transport you to a far off place and time this is one to get lost in. 4.9 stars.  <br />
B0001AP12G|5.0|It took me a minute to buy this CD but I'm glad I finally did.  It is a good debut album.  The beats are nice and it gives you something to think about.  I can listen to it all the way through and repeat it again (which is very rare thing from artists these days).  I can't wait to see what Kayne does next.
B00005JN2Z|5.0|What happens when two men meet who are the best at their \\"profession\\" (taxi driver, professional assassin), but who are mere boys when it comes to knowing themselves and what really THEY are about (\\"when was the last time you looked in the mirror\\"). It is no coincidence that Fox spends his time looking in a mirror at Vincent, because the mirror is a metaphor in this film. This is an excellent film on all levels. I just reviewed the DVD of \\"Spartan\\" and ripped on its wooden, unrealistic screenplay. Compare the Spartan screenplay to \\"Collateral\\" and you can see the difference between an amateur and a professional. Collateral is an excellent film.
B0000C8AV2|5.0|I wonder how the most underrated/ poorly received Dylan albums [Empire Burlesque, Kncocked out loaded, Under the red sky] would sound like if they were all produced by Daniel Lanois, who does a super job in producing Oh Mercy.  I remember listening to this album at the time of its release, when I was living in Calcutta and realizing that it's a milestone.  Great album, a very 'mood' album.  Let the night be quiet .. and hang on to every word that Mr Dylan sings.
B0000029GA|5.0|Nases First Album is the best out of all the albums he made except for Street Disiplence. The Enhanched Album includes something more then Two Discs.

The Street Disciplence can also work on the computer. And also this one. But it's not like the Enhanched. You're out of luck if you want that CD to be Enhanced. But if you were me, The Tiger.

B0002IU988|1.0|I loved Creed's first album with original members Mark Tremonti on guitar, Scott Stapp on Vocals, Brian Marshall on bass, and Scott Phillips on drums. However, after that album, I think Scott Stapp was given too much control over the direction of the music and it started to really suck with their second album, and their third was even worse. Then I hear they're getting Brian Marshall back and ditching Stapp, so I get all excited. I'm hoping that I'll get to hear Brian's grungy bass and Mark's powerful guitar riffs once again like in the days of 'My Own Prison' with such kick ass songs as Ode, Illusion, and Unforgiven. This Miles guy comes in trying to sound just like Scott, but worse. So needless to say, I think it sucks.
B0009MDPYM|4.0|If you liked Keanu Reeves in The Devil's Advocate (1997), you'll like him in this devilish story.<br /><br />  A Hispanic, Manuel (Jesse Ramirez) is under the ruins of a freeway.  Under some wooden planks in the ground he finds an accient dagger wrapped in a Nazi flag.  With he dagger, he begins to walk away and suddenly is hit by a car that came out of nowhere.  He appears to be dead, but 27 seconds later, still holding the dagger he becomes alive and runs off.  The car is totalled, but Manuel is perfect.<br /><br />  An Asian mother (Suzanne Wang) find her daughter (Jhoanna Trias) possessed.  John Constantine (Keanu Reeves) is called upon to help the girl. He is a modern-day exorcist.  First he finds the right religious symbol to shadow upon the girl for irritation.  Then he gets himself close to the demon's face and calls it a profanity. When the demon's face tries to come out of the girl's throat, Constantine gives it a right hook.<br /><br />  John Constantine is really tired of fighting the demons all the time and he just found out he has lung cancer from smoking since he was 15.  Be as it may other people are still in need of his help, including Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz) who had a twin sister that fell from the hospital roof, but she believes it was murder.<br /><br />  Stay tuned after the end credits.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|FireFly was one of the greatest science fiction shows made in the 90's, but unfortunatly it's life was cut short along side the many one shot wonders of it's time. If you liked babylon 5 because it was more \\"real\\" then star trek, then think about firefly because it's in the same league. Talented writers, smart producers, and a cast that was able to bring their characters home. Watch the movie when it's released and you will come back for the series.
B00029LNHS|4.0|Ok, I am a little bit off the beat'n path with this review...it's definitely not my genra of expertise.    But I really like how this one makes me feel! It's a \\"feel good\\" poppy hip-hoppy kind of thing. Nice meaty dance beats and some really good songwriting in my opinion. It may not be true to the \\"gun-slinging, ho-boppin'\\" writing styles of most hip-hop/rap I hear these days...which is probably one reason why I like it so much.
0679805273|5.0|this book is for all ages. it's reality in cartoons! a great pick me up for when things seem to be going for the worst. just 15 minutes of reading the book and you're back on the road to your goal. everyone should own this.
B00006ZCFH|5.0|First I must say that I absolutely love Erykah Badu and I don't think she could ever be disappointing because there is a pulse to her music.  Worldwide Underground is exactly what it's name says.  If your not familiar with underground music and don't dig it then stay away because there is nothing commercial about this ep.  While this disc doesn't weigh heavily on thought provoking lyrics such as those laid on Mama's Gun the sound and experimentation with vocals and arrangement is impressive and refreshing.  Her voice and vocal ability are enough to praise her work and if you enjoy her music, this ep will not leave you dissappointed.  It's not a full album but it's enough to hold us over until she is ready to release again.  If you are a serious fan, it's a must have because it's different than anything else she's released and you wouldn't want to have it missing from your collection. The energy of this ep makes you feel like your watching Badu live at an outside concert on a beautiful sunny day with just the right amount of breeze.  The highlights of the disc are: Danger, Back in the Day, Woo, Think Twice, and I Want You.  The weaker songs are: Love Of My Life Remix and The Grind.  One warning though, it will be too much for you to digest when you first listen to it so listen to it at least twice and I promise by the second time you will begin to grow into it and it will become one of your favorite choices.  Peace and Love*
B000002U8G|5.0|A lot has been said in these reviews, and \\"Meddle\\" is obviously one of the more popular efforts by the Floyd. I bought it twice on vinyl, once on cassette, and then on CD, but I sat on it, breaking it, so I bought it again. Willingly each time.<br /><br />The cover art is a play on words; if you look at it from a distance, you can see it's a close-up of an ear, with the surface of water superimposed over it. Hence, \\"waves of sound.\\" These things come up in Floyd covers quite a bit, if only you take a minute to study it.<br /><br />The music, although only six selections, pretty much runs the gamut, from menacing (\\"One of these days, I'm going to cut you into little pieces!\\"), to soft borderline romantic; the words to \\"A Pillow Of Winds\\" show Waters' ability to assume any role he pleases in his lyrics, and Wright and Gilmour are the perfect vehicles for delivering his lyrics. You are shown optimism and perseverence in \\"Fearless,\\" even with the much criticized sounds of a stadium full of soccer fans singing \\"You'll Never Walk Alone\\" appended to the ending, it's still a good, well-made song.<br /><br />As popular as \\"Meddle\\" is, the two most hated Floyd songs ever, \\"San Tropez\\" and \\"Seamus,\\" follow, sort of a diversion from the majesty of the opening numbers, I guess one can call it a \\"breather. \\"San Tropez\\" is a light jazzy number, and if you didn't immediately recognize Waters' voice, you'd never know it was Pink Floyd. It's not that it's a bad song, it's just not what people would expect from such a progressive Pink Floyd release. The guitar solo is played almost like Hawaiian slide, and the piano solo at the end, is like something from 1950's jazz records. It's well-done, but very much maligned by casual fans, and some more serious fans, as well. \\"Seamus\\" is a slow, lazy blues number, not much substance, and the howling dog in the background has gotten some funny reactions by house-dogs; they don't know where this imaginary dog is, and go crazy trying to find it.<br /><br />The highlight of the record, and by many, many accounts, their collective career, is \\"Echoes,\\" probably the most-played FM radio request in history. At least when FM radio was worth something. I guess I shouldn't make such a blanket statement, but every facet of the entertainment industry has been so polluted with useless, flash-in-the-pan junk, that I know, myself, I don't bother listening much anymore. \\"Echoes\\"  is a multilayered opus the took up a whole side of the original LP. If you are into \\"expanding your consciousness,\\" this selection can do it naturally. I've always held the conviction that Pink Floyd is an \\"anti-drug\\" band. Yes, a lot of their fans like to get stoned, or \\"trip\\" on certain substances, but the thing about this type of band, and this band in particular, is you don't need any of that, all you need is some imagination. If you can think in pictures and concepts, performances like \\"Echoes\\" will take you on a journey, from the tranquil seascapes hinted at in the beginning part, to the ornate, colorful images conjured up in the \\"funky\\" part of the instrumental. The art of the segue is mastered here, when you hear this fairly simple rhythm, peppered with guitar and organ interplay, fade into this  formless \\"abyss\\" of swirling noise, with truly creepy, shrill, I don't know what to call them, high-pitched \\"calls,\\" I guess, in this grey fog, no signs of life otherwise in this void, so desolate, so full of nothing, and the gentle return to the surface, droning keyboards, the \\"pings\\" from the intro come back, with this rhythm accompanying it, the anticipation is almost tangible, when this explosion of sound comes at you, almost a \\"jump start,\\" and you're back into the verse, the chord progression follows, taking you to what I call the \\"take-off.\\" The band is playing softly, and these voices fade in, at least they sound like voices, maybe voices mixed with wind, not sure, slowly encircling you, getting louder as the instruments fade away, and off you go, into the Cosmos, and it all slowly fades into nothing. And you stay wherever it takes you, until you open your eyes.<br /><br />With this stuff, who needs drugs? That would just spoil it!t all slowly fades into nothing. And you stay wherever it takes you, until you open your eyes.    With this stuff, who needs drugs? That would just spoil it!
B000022TSW|1.0|This movie was far too much, even for me. And i love stupid crude movies. Some funny jokes would make it worth the one star i gave it. But i would strongly advise renting before you buy it. You may like it, you may not. Enjoy!
B00003CWTI|5.0|PT Anderson's Magnolia is a beautiful picture that tackles many interpersonal issues.  The scope of this film is huge, and it's hard to imagine how anyone other than PT Anderson could have made this movie.  Mr. Anderson has said he got the idea for the film from his good friend Aimee Mann, who had written a song with the lyric, later to be used in the film, \\"now that I've met you, would you object to never seeing each other again?\\".  This phrase may SOUND strange but if you think about the human dynamic, you can understand what this means.  When newly acquainted with someone you are putting on your best face; you realize that to develop a real relationship with that person you will inevitably end up letting him/her see some of the parts of you that perhaps you are uncomfortable facing yourself.  You can only stay \\"perfect\\" for a short period of time; there is no way out of letting our flaws show to others.  Example: someone feels like \\"if you got to know me, and knew the REAL me, you would run away.  So I will run away first before I ruin the good first impression you have\\".. etc.. <br /> <br />Speaking of the notorious rain scene, I like to think of it as the death of a person's dreams enacted in real time.  I think of the frogs as the \\"princes\\" of the world, who cannot help anymore and have been rejected; never kissed.  In other words, chivalry cannot save us now; the chance for our fantasies to come true has ended.  Going back to what I stated in the first paragraph, if you have seen the movie, one could think of the female character that dates John C Reilly and says the phrase above as a wounded person who cannot reach out and save herself from the demons of her past life experience.   <br /> <br />The filming style of this movie (cinematography) is amazing.  Julianne Moore plays perhaps her best role yet as a woman who marries a man not for love, but for his money and only when he is dying of cancer does she finally realize that she loves him deeply.  During her marriage she never appreciated what she had; you don't know what you've got till it's gone. <br /> <br />Overall, this is a piece about the pain that we humans cause one another; how one person hurts us and then we turn around and hurt another.  It is also about the human capacity for love and kindness, and how the cycle of abuse will not end until we learn to face our flaws and mistakes and realize that we will probably make the same mistakes again.  This makes us human. <br /> <br />The best description of the ideas of this movie comes in the form of the songs of Aimee Mann, on the soundtrack.  She inspired this movie and the music is transcendental.  In the song, \\"Momentum\\", she sums up the running theme of the film in the line \\"oh, for the sake of momentum I'm condemning the future to death SO IT CAN MATCH THE PAST\\". <br /> <br />Overall an amazing film, and awkward to talk about; better to see it for yourself.
B00005JL3A|3.0|Being a huge fan of the games and a huge horror fan, i was excited when i heard about this. But that soon vanished after seeing the movie. Poor special effects and CG, coupled with characters i didn't give a crap about wasn't much insentive to watch to the end but i gave it a go. It didn't really get much better. A few good scenes and the original Licker were ok, but all in all it's not one to rush out and buy right away. And if you are gonna get it, don't expect too much. Enjoy!
068485743X|5.0|I have digested nearly twenty books on writing over the last few years, and The First Five Pages is my favorite. Noah Lukeman fills the pages will practical, real-world suggestions that will maximize your potential to be read. Also, he adds many stylistic pointers that can be laid side by side your manuscripts as you edit them. This book is perfect for those wishing to become professional writers. While not every aspect of writing is covered, the material that is covered is quality. You will not regret puchasing this book.
B00005JL9B|5.0|A question... Could you kill your best friend? Somthing to think about when watching this movie. This didn't feel like watching a movie, it felt real. And that made somthing inside me cling to this movie and hang on everything it did. It raises questions too. Could a govenment get to this stage where they so desperate that they are willing to reinforce somthing like this? Maybe, but this movie will have a major effect on you whether you want it to or not, because it's just one of those movies. It will make you question culture, law, politics and friendship. Don't even think about it, just buy it. Enjoy!
0743454537|5.0|This book was the first to ever make me cry. After it, I was stunned. I felt like I knew the characters, as if i were in the story. My Sister's Keeper is very unique with its subject and way of being written. I never got bored because of the constant switch of totally different characters. I definitly recommend this book. The ending is very suprising, but the book teaches many lessons, too. I learned to appreciate how simple my life is in comparrison to the Fitzgerald family. As it says on the back cover, \\"My Sister's Keeper is the story of one family's struggle for survival at all human costs and a stunning morale parable for all time\\"
B00005RHGK|4.0|First of all, let me just say one thing. Please just take this movie for what it is. It's a monster movie. Pure and simple. I too, when i first saw it, thought it was poor when they revieled what the Creeper was. But then i thought 'Well as a monster movie, it was pretty good.' Great performance from Justin Long, some fantastic camera work and eerie sound effects help to create a solid monster movie and makes for some really tense moments! With reference to Duel and some of Salva's favourite monster movies of old, this is fun to watch and will leave you feeling like there is some hope left for monster movies. Enjoy!
B00004SCX6|1.0|OMG, seriously.<br /><br />Why Britney Spears sucks/Why you should buy real pop like Natasha Bedingfield and Anna Nalick<br /><br />- Lip-synching! Now, we've all heard about the Ashlee Simpson dance. Guess what, Britney's lucky she hasn't been caught! I HAVE a recorded from MTV concert of Britney not lip-synching. Hilarious! She sounded awful! To the point where I labeled the concert as comedy on the tape. Yet, if you've seen her show Chaotic and watch her perform and/or seen her live, the vocals sound similar to the CD. Umm...this could be becuase the CD is PLAYING!<br /><br />- Vocal enhancing. Now, I understand some artists use this for touch-ups, and even without it, they'd be fine. Britney Spears basically RELIES on this for her voice. Enough said. She's fake.<br /><br />- MTV and Top 40 radio. Now, I like top 40 radio. Well, sometimes. I like real pop, like Natasha Bedingfield, Beyonce, and people that write, use real voices, produce, etc. Well, what if that didn't exist? Who would be recognized? Beyonce, Natasha Bedingfield, Anna Nalick, etc., etc. How about Britney Spears. There's no voice enchancements, no MTV, and no top 40 radio. Guess what would happen. She would be walking out of her stage, crying, because she would've SUCKED!<br /><br />Even with voice enhancements, MTV, and top 40 radio, it seems this baby star is GONE! Yeah, I did hear that she IS making another album that will be out in spring. But guess what, here I will be, writing another 1-star review to save your money...per usual with this fake.<br /><br />Yeah, go buy some Natasha Bedingfield or Anna Nalick. And, if your into rock, Chevelle and MxPx are good. Or if you like metal, and earlier review below posted some great metal bands.<br /><br />As for this CD, and Britney, her 15 minutes is tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock, DING!!!!!!!!
0767834739|2.0|Shocking! Of course, i tried to take it on it's good points. Before i saw it i was looking forward to seeing the movies translation of nemesis. It was CRAP! There's no other word for it, sorry to anyone who may have found that rude, but it was a big guy in a suit. The movies neither scared me, thrilled me, or even interested me at parts. But as i always say, it may be to some people's liking so check it out if you liked the first one. All in all, i didn't like either. I'm glad i still have the games to give it a good name. Enjoy!

Now, we've all heard about the Ashlee Simpson dance. Guess what, Britney's lucky she hasn't been caught! I HAVE a recorded from MTV concert of Britney not lip-synching. Hilarious! She sounded awful! To the point where I labeled the concert as comedy on the tape. Yet, if you've seen her show Chaotic and watch her perform and/or seen her live, the vocals sound similar to the CD. Umm...this could be becuase the CD is PLAYING!<br /><br />- Vocal enhancing. Now, I understand some artists use this for touch-ups, and even without it, they'd be fine. Britney Spears basically RELIES on this for her voice. Enough said. She's fake.<br /><br />- MTV and Top 40 radio. Now, I like top 40 radio. Well, sometimes. I like real pop, like Natasha Bedingfield, Beyonce, and people that write, use real voices, produce, etc. Well, what if that didn't exist? Who would be recognized? Beyonce, Natasha Bedingfield, Anna Nalick, etc., etc. How about Britney Spears. There's no voice enchancements, no MTV, and no top 40 radio. Guess what would happen. She would be walking out of her stage, crying, because she would've SUCKED!<br /><br />Even with voice enhancements, MTV, and top 40 radio, it seems this baby star is GONE! Yeah, I did hear that she IS making another album that will be out in spring. But guess what, here I will be, writing another 1-star review to save your money...per usual with this fake.<br /><br />Yeah, go buy some Natasha Bedingfield or Anna Nalick. And, if your into rock, Chevelle and MxPx are good.<br /><br />As for this CD, and Britney, her 15 minutes is tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock, DING!!!!!!!!
B0007TKNL0|4.0|I have to say that this movie is amazing. I have never seen the original Broadway production, but I definatly plan to now.  <br /> <br />Personally I thought that the singing in this movie was spectacular. I know some people don't feel the same way. I really think that Emmy Rossum as Christine did amazing in this movie. Her singing and acting was excellent. I am a big fan of hers now.  <br /> <br />Gerry Butler as the Phantom. Well what more do I need to say. I think the one thing about the Phantom was that his face wasn't what I expected. I thought it would be worse. Other than that though, I think that Gerry was excellent as well. <br /> <br />Ahh, the young lover Raoul. I think that Patrick Wilson was very good in this movie. He played Raoul very well. It could be played a few different ways, but I think that this is one of the better interpetations of it. <br /> <br />The sets in this movie are beyond description. I am very impressed with them. The costumes were also beautiful. I think overall that this is one of the best musicals I have seen.

B000667FN8|1.0|Man, Simple Plan SUCKS!!! I heard them when I bought my Totally Hits 200...something copy. They sound JUST LIKE GOOD CHARLOTTE AND BLINK-182!!! Along with other similar crappy, untalented bands. This sucks! Definitely don't buy this. Get some Nine Inch Nails or Chevelle for a much better Alt. Rock CD. And Van Halen and AC/DC for your oldies (I like recent stuff better...idk why, just do).
B00005Q4CS|4.0|Requiem for a dream is about four different people who's lives go through hell just to be happy at the end but thats how I see it and maybe you will too. The first Character Harry wants to sell drugs for a living but of course selling drugs in New York City is not easy because everybody sells Here.The Second character is Marion Harry's Girlfriend will do anything for drugs even sleep with other men to get it.The third character is Tyrone who's Harry's Best Friend and helps harry sell drugs but things don't look good for him when he gets arrested.Then their's the last character with the strongest Proformance in the movie Harry's mother who loves her son as much as TV she always wanted to be on it and finally gets her chance but she also wants to look good on tv so she goes to the doctor to see how can she lose weight and he gives her pills to do that but the problem is she starts to get addictive to it.The end of the film you'll have to see for yourself and sometimes it is kind of boring but thats just a very small portion but other wise then that it's a must see so buy it now.
B0000025D0|5.0|Since I've recently purchased a copy of Springsteen's \\"Darkness on the Edge of Town,\\" I'm stuck in this internal debate of which Springsteen works is his greatest.  It's between \\"Darkness,\\" and \\"Born to Run.\\"  Well folks internally the verdict is still out.  I'll let you know when I write up the review on \\"Born to Run.\\"<br /><br />\\"Darkness on the Edge of Town,\\" stands out as Springsteen's most searing and raw, rocking and bitterly true.  With \\"Darkness\\" Springsteen and his associated E-streeters shed the Jersey come lately Bob Dylan folk rock troubadour and squarely places himself in a different class, perhaps a class all his own.  With \\"Darkness,\\" I think some pent up frustrations are not just bubbling to the surface but down right boiling over.  There is so much to uncover in these lyrics.  Springsteen establishes himself as the voice of the factory working class trying to overcome life's blandness and harshness.  Some of the songs even sound like they could be the accompanying soundtracks to Soviet Realism literature, the same state-sponsored literature of the Stalin years that glorified the working class proletariat and the machinery of the working class.  But whereas that literature artistically was akin to a piece of crap, Springsteen's \\"Darkness\\" elevates the hard existence to art, giving a voice to the voiceless.<br /><br />You have so many good songs on this CD.  It starts with Badlands, a rousing rave-up opener. \\"Poor man wanna be rich,<br /><br />rich man wanna be king / And a king ain't satisfied till he rules everything.\\"  Next is Adam Raised a Cain and this one smokes.  Springsteen has never been so evidently angry.  It sounds like he either went through this ordeal himself or just got finished reading Steinbeck's \\"East of Eden,\\" before writing this song.  That's not implausible seeing as \\"The Ghost of Tom Joad,\\" was inspired in part by Steinbeck's \\"Grapes of Wrath.\\"  Something in the Night, Racing in the Streets, and Streets of Fire are all pretty enough ballads on the surface but the lyrics reveal Springsteen's continued theme of immortalizing the automotive escape, the ballad to redemption via hot rod dreams and running off with the girl.  I suppose there is no one that does this better.  He captured this best I suppose with \\"Thunder Road,\\" and secondarily with \\"Jungleland,\\" and maybe thirdly with \\"Born to Run.\\"<br /><br />The highlights here are many but to me \\"Prove it All Night,\\" \\"Candy's Room,\\" and especially \\"Darkness on the Edge of Town,\\" truly stand out.  There is a musically pristine moment on \\"Prove it All Night,\\" when the music is stripped back to Max Weinberg's bass drums and a whispering singing Springsteen cooing, \\"Baby, tie your hair back in a long white bow, / Meet me in the fields out behind the dynamo, / You hear the voices telling you not to go, / They made their choices and they'll never know, / What it means to steal, to cheat, to lie, / What it's like to live and die.\\"<br /><br />Ahhh...to listen is to live and relive moments all over again. In Springsteen's catalogue there is something most people can connect with.  It doesn't come more raw and gritty than \\"Darkness.\\"<br /><br />--MMWugh ballads on the surface but the lyrics reveal Springsteen's continued theme of immortalizing the automotive escape, the ballad to redemption via hot rod dreams and running off with the girl.

B00005NTN5|5.0|When I went out to buy some Dvd's I saw this one and decided to buy it not knowing if it was good or not but at the time I did'nt care, and I'm glad that I didn't because this movie is crazy good in so many ways. First it has to deal with the mafia ,second it has two girls (Jennifer Tilly and Gina Gershon) that want to be with each other but can't because Jennifer is marry to a man thats in the mafia, But Jennifer wants out and gina has a plan to do just that, first steal 2 million dollars from jennifers husband without getting caught and pretty much thats the story right there. But what happens inbetween is very funny and scary. Do not let your kids see the unrated version though because the sex scene is very fresh even for me and Im 18 <br />Buy this Dvd now I promise you love it in every way.
B000000WF0|5.0|This is not only the best album of the Verve but also the best Manchester Sound. It's very LaoLuan and NiuBi. <br /> <br />If you like morden Brit-pop,this album is your first choice.
B00005JKQZ|3.0|I bought this movie because everybody was saying it was good but when I saw it I thought it was long and boring I mean in order to see it you need a dictionary to understand each word they say in it or be really smart , but what I found interesting was the twist which fooled me and I like it because how it was presented. The dvd has lots of stuff for you to watch which is pretty good but thats about it.
B00000272N|3.0|It is not a good grunge album of AIC. I bought it just as I'm a AIC fan.
0783232039|5.0|Bride of Chucky is a great film because it has everything a movie should have First Chucky's Girlfriend Tiffany brings the evil doll back to life then after some events tiffany becomes a doll herself and the rest of the movie they have to get a necklace to be in different bodys it's as simple as that. The film is scary and very funny and is worth owning.
B000062Y98|4.0|This is the first c.d. I ever listened to from Blind Guardian. I am impressed with this band. They have a unique and awesome sound that sets them apart form any band you try to compare them with. This band is not your typical Metal band, with sensless lyrics and pure screaming. Thet have much more controlled vocals and the band overall has exceptional skill. If your not into the pure death metal vocals but still like the heavy music, this band is perfect for you, and this is some of Blind Guardians best work. If your interested in other bands of this type of metal style, you shoyld check out Iced Earth, Nightwish, Demons and Wizards, or Iron Maiden.
6305428042|5.0|Hocus pocus is a must have for so many reasons.It's about three witches from the past that come to the future to suck the lives out of kids to stay young forever.The movie is funny and just as entertaining.Buy this for your kids now and I promise you'll love it too.
B0001MDQ2G|1.0|This collection of crap should not even be classified as metal. There was one good song on the entire album. The vocals are way to soft. It's great to see bands from the middle east come out and try there hand at this but these guys just need to stick to another area of music.
B0009MDPYM|3.0|Keanu gives his usual performance, not Oscar worthy but entertaining. We were not totally familiar with the comic books so we were kind of lost in the beginning as to what was going on, who was bad and who was good (although that is never totally clear). The special effects and camera work are marvellous. Djimon Hounsou as always is beautiful. Rachel Weisz regretably was weaker than usual and is unbelieavable as a cop. Another notable acter in this film is the beautiful Tilda Swinton. She was beautifully cunning as the fallen angel Gabrielle. This film is worth the entertaining rental value.
0767812166|5.0|I would recommend this movie, especially to any Sci-Fi fans. But it has something for everyone. Karen Allen and Jeff Bridges are great in their roles. John Carpenter may be known for his horror movies, but he does well in this genre as well. The movie does go over the top with the usual government and military desire to destroy aliens. But most Sci-Fi movies do, don't they?
5550155184|4.0|The Da Vinci Code opens in Paris at Louvre Museum where renowned curator Jacques Sauniere runs through his museum trying to get away from Silas, an albino monk with a mission. Jacque's escape is unsuccessful and he ends up murdered. Before his death he manages to leave a cryptic message for his granddaughter Sophie Neveu, a cryptologist. She believes solving the message will lead her to her grandfather's murderer but what she learns will change her life forever. Regrettably the message includes the name of Robert Langton, a symbologist.<br /><br />Robert is called in by the police where he's led through the last moments of Jacques life until the beautiful Sophie appears saying she has a message for him. While she occupies the inspector Robert dials a number Sophie gave him which strangely goes to her personal email. Stranger still is the message she leaves him. He's the prime suspect in Jacques murder and she has a plan to get him out of the museum, past the police and through the embassy doors.<br /><br />Instead of taking the easy way out and hiding under the shield of diplomatic immunity Robert decides to help Sophie crack the secret message her grandfather left which in tern leads to another message and another. Each time giving them insight into her grandfather's secret life with the Priory of Sion a secret religious society which supposedly involved such members as Sir Issac Newton, Botticelli and most importantly the great artist Leonardo DaVinci. During their hunt for the truth they don't know who to trust or who to believe. All they have is one another.<br /><br />By the time I got around to reading this book most of the hype around The DaVinci Code had died down. This was a gift from my sister-in-law so not necessarily a book I would have bought myself.<br /><br />The characters were enjoyable, the story line was easy to follow and it was entertaining. There may be a few new concepts raised about the Grail and religion but really nothing strikingly new but then again it is a work of fiction and I didn't read it expecting to find some new revelation. I read it for the entertainment value, which it definitely has.<br /><br />I enjoyed working on the mini mysteries as Sophie and Robert followed the clues her grandfather left them. The search for these clues are what move the story along. The character interludes are like commercials some are good some are not. Brown's depiction of artwork, architecture, documents, and secret rituals are believable and leave a lasting impression and spark curiosity for further research. I was also impressed with his portrayal of women.<br /><br />What I didn't like was the repetitiveness of some of the scenes. When Brown switched from one character's perspective to another he would repeat information given in the previous scene; as the story picked up momentum this lessened.<br /><br />Overall, I was entertained. Is it worth reading? You bet but only for its entertainment value.ction and I didn't read it expecting to find some new revelation. I read it for the entertainment value, which it definitely has.

B00023B1A8|5.0|This is a great DVD. I have never seen CSN in concert, but this more than makes up for it.
0143034901|5.0|I got so caught up in this book that I didn't want to read it because then I would finish it and it would be over.  It had a little bit of every type of genre and was very well written.  It really is my new favorite book . . . I think I'll go reread it.
B00009P1O2|5.0|I loved watching this DVD. The only drawback is the song list doesn't include the theme for Flash Gordon. Otherwise it's a good sampler of Queen's greatest stuff.
B0002X314C|1.0|IN THIS DAY AND AGE OF MUSIC THAT REALLY SUCKS, THIS ONE STANDS OUT AS THE KING OF WORST ALBUMS TO DATE. THIS ALBUM SOLD ONLY BECAUSE THE GENERAL PUBLIC IS DESPERATE FOR GOOD MUSIC AND THIS IS JUST NOT IT.
B00009P1O2|5.0|I loved this DVD!  The concert itself showed Queen/Freddie Mercury at their very best.  I've always loved their sound; but, to see them in action was a real thrill.  The presentation was top quality.  The extras were very informative and entertaining.....not the least bit boring.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|As a musician and guitar player, the guitar work on this is outstanding, the harmonies make the hair on my neck stand up. The \\"Hole In The World\\" not only makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand up, it moves me to tears. Joe Walsh is at his best with new and old songs, what a smoothy he can be on the guitar licks. My main dissappointment with the whole thing is, I want all of this on a CD so I can just listen to it on the road.
B00005K3OT|5.0|This movie was first introduced to me by my colleague: she lent me a DVD. I watched it a couple of times (had to show it to my friends, too) and I realised that I liked it so much that I wanted a DVD of my own :) I think its a beautiful movie (the scenery, the period of time depicted, the costumes and makeup; actors play very well!) There is some wisdom in the movie, and that's what is important, and is so rare in the numerous releases these days.
0385512058|2.0|I was expecting a good insight into the topic of networking but was disappointed by the rather shallow treatment of this subject. The author tries to differentiate between the \\"name droppping, business card-distributing\\" schmoozer-type (that one comes across at parties, events, and conferences) and an effective networker, but in the end he fails to distinguish himself from those schmoozers.    If you're looking for guerilla networking tactics you will find many (and you may already know most of those) in this book. If, however, you want some insight into effective techniques to connect (I prefer the word \\"connecting\\" to \\"networking\\"), then pass this one.
B0006284JQ|1.0|ARGH!!! <br /> <br />Why do people like Britney Spears? She's awful! She lip-synches at her concerts, she never writes, she is just some who wants loads of attention from the media. <br /> <br />Why MTV, why? Why did you allow this girl a record deal? She can't sing! Even with Jive's voice enhancements, she's just the worst singer of the 20th and 21st century. <br /> <br />Avoid this at all costs.
038073186X|5.0|Having read a great many mysteries by now, most of the time I can figure out whodunnit about halfway through. That's what is so refreshing about Shutter Island. I was absolutely blown away by the ending of this incredible, original story. Lehane is an outstanding writer whose prose and dialogue are a pleasure to read. Nary a jarring note from start to finish. Shutter Island is not your average detective or noir genre novel. I'm going to read it again to see if I missed any clues - I'm sure I did. Lehane's earlier books were good - this one is better than good. Give it a shot - you won't be disappointed.
B0000X61VE|4.0|The only part of this video I use is the 10 minute all body workout.  The other workouts are just too much for me.  I really like the 40 minute workout on her New Dimensions video, and I use it religiously and have seen great results.  However, when I don't have time to do that I do the 10 minute workout on this video, and it makes me feel great.  Sometimes I do it two or more times a day.  So it is worth it to me to just do the 10 minute routine on this video and skip the rest.  If you are into intense workouts the other workouts might be for you.  The fast pace for that amount of time is not for me.  The fast pace of the 10 minute workout is great however.
B0009K7RES|3.0|I thought it was a new album but it was not it was songs from his last album in one take I guess.  My fault for not researching longer but Mark still rocks and I saw him in concert fantastic.  Just don't be disapointed when you have heard them all before.

0694003611|5.0|Can't wait til my grandson is a little older so I can read this book to him. Actually I read it to him now but I think he'll get more out of it as time goes by. It's the perfect book in its' simplicity. The words flow in a natural bed-time kind of rhythm and it conjurs up those kinds of images that make you remember what being a child was all about.The pictures in the book are very nice too, very wise use of colour but the story holds up even if there were no pictures.     I read this to my kids when they were very young but they still remember it like it was yesterday...and so do I....that's what makes it a classic.
B0006Z2KXE|5.0|How can you top the star power of Hepburn-Grant-Stewart? Well you cant! This is probably one of the can't miss trio in movie history. Hepburn radiates with icy commanding presence. Jimmy Stewart was at his \\"everyman\\" best and the ever suave Cary Grant demonstrates again his talent for comedy.  <br /> <br />Some really memorable scenes including the \\"screwbally\\" opening with Grant and Hepburn, the \\"fireworks\\" speech of Jimmy Stewart that melted Hepburn icy heart, and the unexpected wedding in the finale. This is just one those movies you watch over and over again.   <br /> <br />The extras in the DVD are topnotch which includes a commentary and 2 feature length documentaries: one involving George Cukor and the other involving Katharine Hepburn told by Hepburn herself. It was such a great documentary as Hepburn herself tells her story from her humble beginnings to her legendary status. That documentary alone is worth the price of the DVD <br /> <br />Grade: A
015603008X|5.0|I first read the short story in my english class back in 7th grade. The short story was really good and I knew that there had to be a novel of it. Sometime later,I found it looking through the library. This book is amazing. I couldn't put it down. It is very well written and is a page turner. Everyone should read this book.
B000067G3C|5.0|This is how action movies should be made. From the beginning to the end, the movie didn't allow you to breathe, there's always something happening. The elevator opening scene provided a sort of prologue for the movie. And yes the movie gets even more exciting the following minutes. <br /> <br />The bulk of the movie focused on Keanu Reeves attempt at preventing the bombing of a public bus by being actually on the bus. That was just pure fun, you've got all the possible roadblocks (traffic, broken bridge, gasoline etc) to keep the movie going. <br /> <br />And then there is the closing scene in the train that serves as sort of epilogue for the movie. The movie wrapped things up quite well. When all the action was done, the movie actually ended in a postponed and obligatory romance between Reeves and Bullock. <br /> <br />Engaging performances from everyone, tight and skillful direction from Jan de Bont, exciting stunts, and some funny moments! You can't go wrong with this movie. <br /> <br />Grade: A-
0375703764|5.0|Astounding is the only word to explain this work.  It is the most amazing thing I have ever read.  The writing style is an art form in and of itself!<br /><br />At first, the footnotes are a bit disruptive.  However, very quickly the reader learns that a big part of this work ARE the footnotes!<br /><br />Definately NOT a \\"fluffy\\" read!  If you start this book, make sure that you have the time to commit, because you WON'T want to put it down.  It's kept me up serveral nights until the \\"wee hours\\" of the morning, lost among it's dark hallways . . .
B0001CCXZW|5.0|The most appealing storyline for me is the Lorelei-Emily relationship. As much as I love the dynamics of Rory-Lorelei relationship, the Lorelei-Emily is the one that truly made me a fan of the show. And I guess season 1 gave us a lot of stories about that, because as the season goes on, even though they still have conflicts, they are in better terms now generally compared to the first 2 seasons.  <br /> <br />The show is populated by great supporting characters, my favorite besides Emily of course (played to perfection by Kelly Bishop) is Paris (played effortlessly by Liza Weil), the overachiever who won't quit. I miss when Rory and Paris were archrivals. I also love the audiophile Lane, out of this planet Kirk, omnipresent Taylor, bowtied Richard, horny Miss Pattie and the sweet as candy Sookie.  <br /> <br />Some of the standout episodes of Season 1 are: <br /> <br />-Pilot (one of the best pilots I have seen, great setup for the characters) <br />-The Lorelei's First Day at Chilton <br />-Rory's Birthday Parties <br />-Kiss and Tell <br />-Rory's dance (great dramatic showdown for Emily and Lorelei, \\"She's gonna get pregnant like you\\") <br />-Christopher Returns <br />-The breakup Part 2 (great Rory episode, and great ending) <br />-Ps I Lo.. (the reaction of Emily when Rory ran away and came to their house was priceless)  <br />-Love, Daisies, and Troubadours (the season ended on a high note, how can you resist the two girls jumping like crazy at the end of the episode) <br /> <br />Grade: A
B0009RCPY8|5.0|Im not going give a movie I love a one star rating just because it was released again; Movies are always going be like that. You buy a movie on dvd, and a better version will come out later on. So here is my review of this set; Ive loved Ghostbusters since I can remember. My parents even taped the Real Ghostbusters cartoon for me when I was too young to remember. I own the first dvd, but never got around to the second dvd for some reason was holding me back. I saw this set and it was cheap, so I decided to pick it up. The movie cases are the way dvds should be, slim and easy to store. The scrapbook was neat, but nothing really speical. If your a Ghostbuster fan, its nice to have a few epsiodes of the cartoons on dvd, because its probably the only time they'll be released on dvd. Or will they?
B00005JMFQ|5.0|I am a huge fan of the large ensemble-multi story-intercutting kind of movies, from the Altman films to Traffic and Happiness etc. This one is no exception. I love the whole look and feel of the film. It's very celebratory and joyous but also heartwarming and a little depressing. <br /> <br />There are multiple storylines that are slightly related to each other that allows some different stories to somehow interconnect (sisters, friends of friends, workmates etc), but the central theme that holds all these stories together is that all of them are stories related to LOVE! Of course some stories are more interesting than others but overall I think there's no really bad storyline.  <br /> <br />The one that I really like is the Laura Linney's storyline. There's romance, drama, and comedy. It's heartbreaking when she finally danced with her long time crush office mate and finally realizing that he might actually like her too. But I am disappointed that towards the end the storyline was somehow neglected. We didn't see what happened to the two, there was no satisfying conclusion.  <br /> <br />Great performances from the entire cast that ranges from simply being funny (Bill Nighy), amusing (Hugh Grant), heartbreaking (Emma Thompson, Laura Linney) and just plain romantic (Colin Firth) <br /> <br />The DVD contains a wealth of worthy supplements. I particularly enjoy the deleted scenes. The only reason they were cut was of time constraint but they could actually enhance the movie. The only thing I was disappointed is that I thought I was going to find deleted scenes with the underdeveloped Laura Linney's storyline, but sadly there wasn't any significant scene for that storyline, makes me wonder if that was how the director intended the storyline to end. There is also a great commentary by the director and some member of the casts. As well as an entertaining music commentary by the director to why he chose some of the songs used in the movie.          <br /> <br />Grade: A-
B000002AZ8|5.0|'Immortality' was not inspired by Kurt Cobain in any way, shape, or form. <br /> <br />The music and majority of lyrics were written before Kurt Cobain died. <br /> <br />Eddie Vedder, the man who wrote the song , you fools, has said this song was NOT inspired by Kurt Cobain.  He SAID that.  <br /> <br />\\"WOW!!!!!!!! PEARL JAM HAD A SONG ABOUT DEATH WHEN KURT COBAIN DIED!!! IT MUST BE ABOUT KURT COBAIN!!! <br /> <br />BECAUSE PEARL JAM NEVER DID THAT BEFORE!!! THE SONG \\"FOOTSTEPS\\" IN 1991, THAT'S NOT ABOUT DEATH! NOPE! THE SONG \\"DEEP\\" ON THE ALBUM TEN, THAT'S NOT ABOUT DEATH!! NOPE!  <br /> <br />HEY!! THE SONG GLORIFIED G OFF OF \\"VS\\" IS ABOUT HAND GUNS! KURT COBAIN LOVED HAND GUNS!!! WHICH *MUST* MEAN THAT GLORIFIED G IS ABOUT KURT COBAIN TOO!!!!\\" <br /> <br />Get it through your f__king heads already.
B00007BKVC|5.0|One of the most beautiful looking movies I have ever seen. Ridley Scott made a visually captivating and resonant movie that captured such beautiful sceneries in America. It provided a beautiful backdrop to Thelma and Louise as they had the roadtrip of their lifetime (which is sadly literally) <br /> <br />The movie started out that seemed to be headed into a movie about girls having fun but an unfortunate (or in their case was it a blessing in disguise) incident led them to something both of them never imagined.  <br /> <br />Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis gave tour de force performances as they embodied their roles perfectly. It's hard to tell which one gave the better performance there are times that I think Sarandon is better and there are times that I think Davis is better. I guess it just means that repeated viewings make you see important details of their acting. <br /> <br />I always regard the ending of the movie as one of the best and one of the most memorable (together with Seven, Casablanca, Butch Cassidy to name a few). When I first saw it, I was just in shock, in awe, moved at how the movie turned out to be. And every time I see the movie it never fails to captivate me. Truly one the most perfect endings in movie history.  <br /> <br />Grade: A
0895260131|5.0|Well, once again we have the lovely phenomenon of people posting reviews of books they obviously haven't read.  It's probably safe to assume that if \\"sun park\\" below had actually read the book and found it \\"full\\" of errors, he/she might have been able to list, oh, say ONE of them?  Don't fall for this.  I used to think Amazon reviewers all read the book they were reviewing until my own books started coming out and I saw nonsense like this happening.  It's despicable, and this person should be ashamed. <br /> <br />I've actually read this book and enjoyed it very much.  It is not filled with prejudice and hatred (though I'd certainly use those words to describe the trashing of a book you haven't read; cf. below).  To the contrary, I'd say given the circumstances Robert Spencer is astonishingly restrained.  He is careful to make distinctions -- thus the genius below who says Spencer says all Muslims are terrorists obviously didn't read the book, either.  Spencer's point is that all the ideological ingredients of jihadism are right there in the Koran, in the life of Muhammad, and in Islamic history, waiting to be exploited by jihadists.  Whether or not most Muslims become terrorists -- most obviously do not -- the point is that all the ingredients are there and can be appealed to by the nutcases (my word, not his). <br /> <br />It's pretty revealing that no major Muslim organization has ever unambiguously renounced the idea of global jihad and the desire to impose Islamic law in every country.  THIS is what needs to be addressed.  Neither I nor any other Amazon customer cares about the one-sentence comments of people who obviously haven't read the book.  We're not interested about whether Spencer is a nice guy or not (though, again, I think he is eminently fair and reasonable, unlike his opponents).  We want to know: why won't so-called moderate Muslims forswear these global ambitions? <br /> <br />Don't give me this \\"Spencer is incorrect\\" nonsense.  Is he incorrect about this, the central point of the whole controversy?   If not, I'd say this is a pretty serious problem, wouldn't you?
B0007OY2MG|5.0|The focus of the season is the transition of Rory to college and how the people around her are going to deal with it (by people I mean Lorelei) as there were episodes allotted the college application, admission letters, graduation, tuition fees etc. And then of course the Dean-Rory-Jess triangle resurfaced. Rory and Paris also became an unlikely best friends. <br /> <br />Some of the best episodes are <br /> <br />-Those Lazy, Crazy, Hazy Days (season 3 premiere) <br />-They Shoot Gilmore, Don't They (just a perfect episode, the comedy, the ensemble, the ending) <br />-A Deep Fried Korean Thanksgiving (another classic Emily-Richard-Lorelei-Rory fight in the dinner) <br />-I Solemnly Swear (A nice Paris-Rory episode as the relationship showed signs of depth after all) <br />-Swan Song (Emily and Jess in one room, you get the picture) <br />-The Big One (Liza Weil stole this episode. This is an important episode for Paris and Liza Weil nailed it. She was heartbreaking, funny, cute you name it) <br />-Happy Birthday Baby (cute opening scene and Emily strikes back again. I love it) <br />-Those are Strings Pinocchio (another triumphant finale, how can you not cry with Rory's graduation speech) <br /> <br />Grade; A-
B00009MGGP|2.0|The House of Cards is brilliant. What a shame some inept editor cut out many of the best parts in this version. For what? Are you in a hurry when you're watching great performances? GIVE US THE WHOLE THING!<br /><br />UPDATE: Just watched the version streaming on Netflix and it was not chopped up. Don't know about newer versions of the DVD, but at least there's a point of comparison now.
B0002Y4TOM|5.0|Gilmore Girls Season 2 skipped the almost unavoidable sophomore slump and produced a strong and engaging second season. In its first airing the ratings increased substantially not to mention that the show was constantly kicking Buffy's butt in the ratings. Some of  my favorite storylines in the show are those involving the relationship of Lorelei and Emily, and this season provided lots of great Lorelei-Emily moments. Kelly Bishop was just perfect for the part.    <br /> <br />Some of the best episodes of second season are: <br /> <br />-Sadie, Sadie and Hemmers and Veils (Season 2 premiere) <br />-The Road Trip to Harvard (Graham was quietly moving anticipating the inevitable college years of Rory) <br />-Like Mother, Like Daughter (Emily and Lorelie in a matching outfit!!!) <br />-The Bracebridge Dinner <br />-Secrets and Loans  <br />-A-Tisket A-Tasket (the Dean-Jess-Rory triangle took the centerstage) <br />-There's the Rub (A great Lorelei-Emily episode) <br />-Lorelei's Graduation Day (It was heartbreaking when Emily and Richard were visibly   moved by Lorelei's graduation) <br />-I Can't Get Started (finale) <br /> <br />Grade: A
B000000W5P|5.0|i had very good time with this cd,it arived in very good shape. And i am very happy.
6305428425|5.0|Two best friends decided to lie in terms of how successful they are in order for them to have the courage to attend their high school reunion. Of course not everything goes as planned as their ridiculous post-it story didn't quite convince their former schoolmates. <br /> <br />The movie's plot may be thin not to mention that probably a third of the movie was a dream sequence. But it just works, especially if you're game with the movie. Probably because Mira Sorvino and especially Lisa Kudrow were perfect in a role they were so adept at playing.. Sorvino was more in your face with her attack on the comedy of the character. Kudrow on the other hand is more oblivious to her comedy that's why it's double as funny and as effective  <br /> <br />There were some really funny lines (Romy on mono - \\"that's like the best diet ever\\"),  some visually amusing scenes (watch out for the old version of Romy and Michele in the dream sequence and the infamous Time after Time dance sequence), and just some wacky ideas (working out on their high heels, the Mary and Rhoda fight) <br /> <br />Of its kind, the movie is really enjoyable. Who cares about plot when you got two appealing stars making fun of Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman. <br /> <br />Grade: A-
B00008J2DQ|5.0|And what a splendid intro it was!  I am a lover of many types of music, and really enjoy heavy stuff.  This album delivered in that department.  I have no complaints.  Faceless is jam packed with ten bad ass tracks, including the classic I Stand Alone.  Check it out.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|Michael Buble has one of the smoothest voices around. He has excellent phrasing and intonation, not to mention a very melodious voice. All of those qualities are perfect for singing the kinds of songs he sings.     Some of the standouts are Feeling Good, I love the sound of it. The band and his voice soar. His version of You Don't Know Me is the most beautiful version of the song that I've heard. It was simple and heartfelt and moving.. This is probably my favorite track of the album. Quando, Quando, Quando was also a superb track. I love the arrangement, they turn it into a soft slow sensual HOT song. Nelly Furtado and Buble's voices blend well together. I just love love this track.    His version of I've Got You Under My Skin was also superb. I already heard his previous take on the song on a previous album. This version was more assertive and more vocally in control. Save the last Dance was another fun-great track as well as his heartfelt rendition of Try A Little Tenderness.     The rest of the songs are also great. Those that I mentioned are just my favorites. This is the kind of album where you would want to listen to all the tracks.    Grade: A
B0000028RR|5.0|This music has attitude!  Almost every single track is good.  It helps to like rap in order to like this band.  The vocalist's delivery has a raplike feel to it.  Fun fact: the song Wake Up was in The Matrix movie, specifically at the end.
B0000639FE|5.0|This is probably my favorite Tom Cruise film. I love that even though Cruise is undoubtedly the star of the movie (the title of the movie?!?), the greatness of the film didn't depend on his star power. The movie got a great supporting cast from Renee Zellweger to Cuba Gooding Jr., the movie's got a great screenplay (\\"Show me the money!!!\\" \\"You complete me\\"... \\"You had me at hello\\") that is amusing and funny and perceptive and intelligent without being pushy. I love that the characters are eloquent but knows its boundaries and know that a simple glance or close up or smirk says it all. In short the screenplay knows when to talk and when to shut up!  <br /> <br />I also love the music used in the movie, I swear every time I hear \\"Free Falling\\" I can just picture Tom Cruise singing his lungs out or the Secret Garden by Springsteen, which is another song that I associate with the movie And of course there are the great performances by the entire cast. Cruise did a great job playing the character, it's fun seeing him play a loser for a change. This is one of his best performances. Renee Zellweger in her breakthrough role was radiant. Even though there's no doubt she's grown as an actress (from Chicago to Cold Mountain), I miss the understated, quiet effervescence and just vulnerability she showed in this movie (also in One True Thing). Cuba Gooding Jr the scene stealer himself, was just great. I especially like the scenes where he's making fun of Jerry. All of those things were used by Cameron Crowe to create this wonderful film. <br /> <br />In the DVD, there's a great extra, a video commentary. It's the normal commentary that we know except that there's another screen where we can see the speakers (Cruise, Zellweger, Gooding, Crowe). There's a small box at the bottom of the screen where we see the movie the way they see them. That was just innovative and very fun to watch, I wonder why others don't adopt this kind of commentary. This would especially work with \\"fun\\" films (Clueless, Friends!!). <br /> <br />Grade: A
B000002MUQ|4.0|The songs on this album have a bright feel to them.  This is my only Van Halen album, so I can not speak about the others.  I just know that Balance is not bad at all.  Very nice music.
B000002J1O|5.0|Nestled between the still-amateurish \\"Foxtrot\\" and the edgy \\"Lamb\\" lies this wonderful recording, the apex of the Gabriel-era Genesis.  Like the fabulous cover art, this album has a softness to it that is endearing.  It is still adventurous and innovative but it is so easy on the ears and nerves that it is still a joy to listen to no matter what kind of traffic you happen to be stuck in.  If you aren't familiar with the early years of Genesis and can only relate to songs from \\"Trick of the Tail\\" onward this may confuse you with its \\"English\\" sensibilities and overtones.  While Yes was stretching the boundaries of prog rock with their boisterous and sharp-edged \\"Fragile,\\" these guys were developing their sound in a much more controlled musical environment that appeals to me more and more the older I get.  Their subtle time changes tend to hide the genius of their arrangements in that they almost slip by you unless you are paying attention.  Plus there is a delightful playfulness about their approach that never gets tiresome.  Lines like \\"There's always been Ethel...\\" in \\"I know what I like\\" will not be found anywhere else in music.  And the remastering has brightened some of the more delicate passages that seemed lost on earlier versions.  In essence this album is so unique that it almost defies criticism.  It is a world unto itself.
B00006CXXU|5.0|This is the only Christina Aguilera album that I own, but I am happy to own it.  It contains the hits Fighter, Dirrty, and Beautiful, which could very well be worth the price of the album alone.  But it doesn't stop there, it has more in store for you.  She has such a great voice, accurate, powerful, and soulful.  I don't know how good Christina's other albums are, but I know that this one is worth it.
0140284087|5.0|The only complaint is that this book isn't longer.  This is how it all begins for Bertie and Jeeves, and several of the incidents related become references in the later stories.  Having read this collection after reading some later works, it was interesting to see how it all started.  Brilliant, and as a previous reviewer noted, the only question is what edition of this book to buy.  For the money, this one was perfect for me.
B00000099Y|5.0|This is the only Tool album that I own, but I know good music when I hear it and this album is a great one.  I don't know about their other albums, but this one has a psychedelic feel to it.  Tool definitely has an original style.  Very nice stuff.
B00000F169|2.0|I didn't realize until after I read it that this movie was made with such a low budget, and by beginners, or else I might have liked it a little.  Not knowing that, I compared it to movies like Soylent Green, Logan's Run, etc., and was almost offended by the shabbiness of the sets, acting, and fairly pointless story.  I'm sure some people would be impressed with the humor(?), or the story(?), but I mostly thought it was worthwhile to watch it as an artifact in the history of sci-fi film.  In this way, it's worthwhile, I think.
B000099T2L|4.0|I like this album. I'm no Beyonce groupie though! I'm reviewing this late, but I'm comparing it with Destiny Fulfilled album and I must say I like this album better. <br /> <br />1. Crazy in Love - Hot song. when this comes on in the club, i will forever be beyonce booty bouncing to this. this song was played out when it first came out, but hearing it every now and then is okay. <br /> <br />2. Naughty Girl - okay song, I just like the ways she emulates Donna Summers with the long notes. i like this song more than most people. <br /> <br />3. Baby Boy - i like dancehall reggae so i like this song. i like this song more than most. i like to wind on this song.  <br /> <br />4. Hip Hop Star - i'm probably like the only person who likes this song. although i don't see B as a hip hop star, i like the whispering tone of her voice and the rock beat. its different and i like it. <br /> <br />5. Be With You - i like this song. me and my friends like to sing this song for some odd reason... guys are always talking about say their names, B wants her man to scream her name! <br /> <br />6. Me, Myself & I - dont really like this song, but you know B gotta do a song for us ladies. i feel like i wanna fall asleep on this song because its boring, slow, and the lyrics are held long <br /> <br />7. Yes - i like this song. beat isn't all that, but i like the lyrics.  <br /> <br />8. Signs - i like this song. its creative. you'll probably like this song if you're into zodiac signs. <br /> <br />9. Speechless - favorite song on the album! B really sang this song. if i could sing, i would sing this to my man <br /> <br />10. That's How You Like It - this song is wack. I never even finished listening to the whole song. its corny! <br /> <br />11. The Closer I Get To You - beautifully sung. great remake. great duet. harmoniously brilliant <br /> <br />12. Dangerously in Love 2 - i like this song. i like B's vocal gymnastics <br /> <br />14. Gift From Virgo - short cute song. doesn't need to be any longer. i like the way she sings on this song. soft whispering lullaby <br /> <br />15. Daddy - i really don't like this song. i think its corny. maybe if it had a different beat i would like it. maybe because i cant relate to this song. <br /> <br />my top songs <br />Speechless <br />Crazy in Love <br />Be With You <br />The Closer I get to You <br /> <br />songs that i always skip <br />Me Myself and I <br />That's How You Like It <br />Daddy
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Joss Whedon makes the best shows on TV, and this is his best show.  Best ensemble cast ever, best writing, best concept, not really much else to say.  The movie will be great also.
B00000DCHI|5.0|Talk about your old time rock & roll!  This CD is great for singing really loud in your car!
B000268QB2|5.0|I got \\"Hopes and Fears\\" from one of my relatives who live in England and told me that this was a great CD. I had never heard of them before so I just never listened to it for some odd reason. One day I heard \\"Somewhere Only We Know\\" on the radio and pulled out the CD and listened to it for the first time. \\"Bend and Break\\" and \\"Everybody's Changing\\" also became favorites of mine. So when I heard Keane was coming in concert to Minneapolis, I bought tickets on the first day they came out. And they sound just as good in person as they do on the CD.
B0007YMUZW|4.0|First off, I want to make it clear that I believe that most people take Ryan Adams way-y-y too seriously.  Taken for what it is, entertainment, this double cd is perfectly satisfactory.  If there has been one gripe that I have had with Ryan Adams in the past is that he has been extremely prolific to his detriment.  He couples songs side by side that are brilliant, catchy, and thought provoking next to songs that make you want to stick a pencil in your eye.  I don't see any value or fairness in comparing or contrasting him to other song writers or singers.  Take his work at its merits.  Unfortunately past work has sometimes been quite polarized.   <br /> <br />Therefore, when I purchased Cold Roses I anticipated that since it was a double cd that it would certainly have some outstanding material, but also that it would include songs that would cause me to instantly hit the forward button.  Surprisingly, this cd is quite strong.  I am not particularly fond of a few songs [e.g., Rosebud], but it isn't that they are bad songs.  I just don't like them.  Overall this cd is consistently good.  The consistency making it the best surprise of all.  Keep 'em coming Ryan.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I remember watching some firefly episodes when they originally aired. I was disappointed when the series was cancelled. Still, I got the box set since it had 3 unaired episode. I was delighted that I basically had forgotton most of the episode and they were just as good as when I saw them before. My wife, who had never seen this series before, also likes this too.
B00003CX5P|4.0|This is definitely the worst of the Star Wars movies, but it isn't meant to be a fight to the death between all the jedi and droids. It's the prelude to all the others, and i can't say i was expecting a lot of fighting. It starts great, Obi Wan and Kwi Gon infiltrate a Trade federation ship. But after that it goes into a sort of low point where not much is going on. One of my favorite scenes though is where Obi Wan and Kwi Gon find Jar Jar Binks, who is funny for about five minutes, but then just gets annoying (In the scene on Tatooine where Jar Jar aggrivates Subulba I was hoping Sebulba might rip his throat out). The movie picks back up when Anakin races his pod. The best scene in the movie. Then it slows back down till the end when the Gungan army fights the droid army, and Obi Wan and Kwi Gon fight Darth Maul. I would rate this movie a four at times when im watching it, but other times i would give it a three. Any real Star Wars fan should pick this up, it isn't bad like some people say, it just has a different type of story.
B0009S4IHY|5.0|I miss early Jackie Chan. Films like \\"Drunken Master\\" and \\"Snake in Eagle's Shadow\\". I also miss the absurd, like \\"The Flying Guillotine\\", \\"Chinese Hercules\\" (go Bolo!) and \\"Lady Kung Fu\\" (where she would blind her opponents with white powder from a side bag before yanking thier eyeballs out with her index & middle finers - yow!).<br /><br />Thank God for Stephen Chow. \\"Kung Fu Hustle\\" is funny and a bit absurd, taking from \\"The Gangs of New York\\" and \\"The Untouchables\\" just to name a few, but manages to still have enough serious moments to satisfy fighting fans.<br /><br />This is what Steve Odenkirk wanted to make with \\"Kung Pow!\\", and almost did. But Stephen Chow has the advantage of growing up in the same country where these films were made, so it's a different sort of insight.<br /><br />Keep 'em coming, Chow!
B00003CXCT|5.0|The picture is clearer now, and the added scenes also up the quality. I especially like how at the end of Episode VI they changed the old-vader ghost to the Episode III Anakin. Very good idea. I was also happy with the commentary, which may sound boring but i encourage you to watch it. It explains a lot about the making of these films. Overall good deal you need these classics in your home.
B000002KDS|5.0|But, I think that even though there are some absolute undeniable classic songs on this album, (which we shall get into in a moment) this one is not quite as good as its predecessor Love It To Death. <br />Perhaps it is just me, I don't know, but as a whole I think that Love It To Death is just a more complete recording. <br />Now, that being said, I still gave this one 5 stars, because it is in fact, a five star record.  <br />From the opening cut of Under My Wheels, this album grabs and does not let go. <br />Perhaps the best opening song of any Alice album. <br />Then from there we get Be My Lover, another great song. <br />It has that undeniable early 70's feel, an almost sweet innocence, wrecked by lasciviousness, and you have to respect that. <br />Then there is the best two songs on this record, back to back no less Halo Of Flies is just, well it's Killer's Black JuJu. And that is indeed saying something. <br />But then Alice comes with his spaghetti western tribute to Jim Morrison. Desperado. Now I think that HOF is probably a better song, but Desperado gets my vote for best song on Killer. <br />You Drive Me Nervous and Yeah, Yeah, Yeah are the two weaker songs on this album. But it bounces back nicely with Dead Babies, which is just a sick lonesome song. I wish I was old enough to have heard this when it first came out, because I think it loses some of its shock value. Then the album closes with the title track. The ending of which reminds me of Weasels Ripped My Flesh by Zappa.  <br />All around, another great album by the ACB. <br />Buy yours today. Or Tomorrow if that works better for you. <br />
B0007GAERG|5.0|The Emancipation of Mimi a very fun record make no mistakes about it and it works. Reason being THE VOICE and the fact is you won't find a better one out there. This album truly has somethng for everyone and it's become apparent because Mimi hasn't left the top 5 since it's release. Now to the songs released so far.. It's Like That: party record with a hard beat...We Belong Together: most played radio song in history...Shake It Off new single that features a hot video..
B00000GAIW|5.0|Excellent Album, with some of their best songs. <br />Definite classic.
B00002SWEM|5.0|Wim Wenders showing another simple and successfull aproach of a real situation. Good perfomances of fantastic musicians, not forgetting Ry Cooder's guitar. When it was on exhibition in Lisbon, I flew there to watch it and I'm still amazed by the camera work when Omara and Ibrahim singing Silencio in the studio.
B0002858YS|1.0|To the person below me: Just because it's on MTV, it doesn't mean it's any good. The sorry state of mainstream music these days....
6305922756|5.0|This Is Spinal Tap is a truly great rock and roll comedy.  Christopher Guest had been playing with a dense rock guitar player character called \\"Nigel Tufnel\\" since 1974, during his National Lampoon days (and before The Rutles).  In 1979, the first version of Spinal Tap appeared in a sketch on a Rob Reiner TV special (with Reiner as Wolfman Jack).  Guest, Michael McKean and Harry Shearer combined their improvisational talents with comedy writer/actor Reiner's \\"mock-documentary\\" format to create the ultimate sendup of rock docs, interview prattle and aging musical idols.     Commercial director/longtime Tap fan Marty DiBergi attempts to document \\"one of England's loudest bands\\" on their ill-fated American tour behind their latest album \\"Smell the Glove.\\"  Following the band on stage, under the stage, in hotel rooms and on the tour bus, DiBergi got that.  But he got more. A lot more.
0671027387|3.0|After reading \\"the da vinci code\\" and \\"angels and demons\\" i found this book a little bit predictable.  I think this book is good, but the plot is really absurd (at the end at least) and if you've read dan brown's books you know that you will expect a twist at the end (a predictable one in this case).  I do enjoyed the book, but it didnt shocked me.<br /><br />The spanish version of the book was published before angels and demos and the da vinci code.  I would have loved the book if i hadnt read those 2 before.
B00014X8KO|5.0|Another favorite of mine is Memories, a lavish omnibus written by Katsuhiro Otomo creator of Akira.<br /><br />The first, and longest of the shorts is Magnetic Rose, directed by Koji Morimoto.<br /><br />An old tank roams deep space in search of Junk. The Corona is home to a four-piece salvage crew; a grizzled pilot named Ivanov; his wisecracking assistant, Aoshima; an irrepressible skirt-chaser, Miguel; and an estranged family man named Heinz. The ship's alarm is triggered by Puccini's Madam Butterfly and a SOS from an asteroid of swirling debris in Sargasso, the graveyard of space.<br /><br />Heinz and Miguel are dispatched from Corona in a key-shaped pod and maneuver through the orbiting field of debris. There's a spectacular shot of the pod free falling. Huge doors usher Miguel and Heinz into a massive French ballroom. A cherub statue quickly whisks away after greeting them. They explore the rooms of the palace and discover a shrine, dedicated to opera diva, Eva Friedel. In another room, Heinz's flashlight spots a little girl at the edge of a table. The statue tips and shatters on the floor before he can reach it. In a darkened corridor, his flashlight glimpses a familiar child tumbling out of the ceiling. Heinz enters a room and finds himself center-stage with a beautiful woman. When her knife plunges into his chest, painful memories in his past are awakened.<br /><br />Miguel has memories of his own. Everything he touches is destroyed. Fine silk dresses become dust. Vibrant roses blacken and shrivel at the slightest contact. Miguel tumbles down broken steps into a lake of oil. There's a decaying pavilion and a piano beneath it. He touches one of its badly broken keys and, in an instant, everything becomes new. The beautiful, French singer whose images adorn every wall of the palace falls into his arms.<br /><br />Magnetic Rose is the tale of an egotistical diva, her glory, and her undying love. This anime is probably the standout of the three, although by a very narrow margin. The technical side of Magnetic Rose is staggering. Shipmates float around each other in zero-g. The Corona is a cylindrical vessel with detailed underbelly propulsion systems, rear solar panels, airlock hatches and cameras. Reconnaissance pods have reversible cockpits and mechanical arms. Small robots transport pods and payload along truss-like structures. The spacesuits (Loaders) resemble tanks with arms.<br /><br />The palace depicted in Magnetic Rose mirrors the baroque excesses of its queen. Classical columns line vast rotundas, bronze and marble balustrades compliment monumental staircases. Grand arches frame every door. Cherubs and allegorical figures embellish every vase and plinth, tray, bowl and candleholder. Ornamentation accents every window. Pillars frame a huge, jeweled entablature with Eva's portrait. Corridors are lined in rich, red carpet. There is no surface of the palaces' interior that is not decorated and though only snippets of her life are recalled, the sheer scope and flamboyance of the palace seem to imply a very sad woman. Magnetic Rose is a bittersweet tragedy set in the isolation and darkness of deep space.<br /><br />The second tale of this trilogy is Stink Bomb, directed by Tensai Okamura.<br /><br />The tale is set in the prefecture of Yamanashi Japan, home of Mount Fuji. It begins inside of a crowded clinic. Nobuo Tanaka has a serious nose-drip. The doctor gives him a shot, a prescription and sends him on his way. In the following scene a bus drops him at the bottom of a hill. Recognized by a security guard, Nobuo slugs up the hill to his job, Nishibashi Pharmaceutical company.<br /><br />Nobuo can't stop sneezing. Wads of tissue and empty medicine bottles overflow his wastebasket. A concerned co-worker recommends the new fever medicine the company recently developed; it hasn't been diluted for sale to the public yet. And they're on the chief's desk. The blue capsules in the red case.<br /><br />The Chief is out of his office. Of the two bottles on his desk, Nobuo recalled what his co-worker said and took the blue case with the red capsules. The Chief is livid when her returns and discovers that the pills on his desk have been bothered. Reluctantly, the co-worker that told Nobuo about the fever medicine steps forward. What's the big deal over a little fever medicine? The Chief is furious.<br /><br />Meanwhile a strange, curious smell permeates the facility: was it something someone ate? Perfume? Rats scramble in their cages. Nobuo wakes up in the lounge. Those fever pills were strong. He checks his watch. A day had passed! Why didn't someone wake him? The halls are empty. The receptionist is slumped over at her desk. Every room's a state of helter-skelter, his co-workers, the lab animals in all of their cages, all lay out. Nobuo grabs the phone and dials the ambulance. The Chief's office is ransacked. Boxes that had covered the wall were scattered around the Chief. His outstretched finger is frozen over the BIOCOM alarm, a control panel the boxes concealed. Nobuo depresses the button. The console pops from the wall, warning lights flash, sirens wail, heavy steel doors fall down separating the compartments of the facility. Monitors light up the wall. Kyoichi Nirasaki of the New Medicine Development glares down at Nobuo. Nobuo explains that he woke from a nap and found everyone unconscious. Nirasaki's scowl softens. He leans to the camera with instructions that Nobuo bring certain papers and medicine to him personally, at Tokyo Headquarters. The medicine is actually a biological weapon the pharmaceutical lab was developing for the military. Ingested, it transforms the ordinary soldier into a toxic weapon, harmless only to himself. Nirasaki orders Nobuo to bring the medicine and all related research to him immediately.<br /><br />Nobuo sets off on his bicycle with the bundle containing the medicine and research. The ambulance he called is gathered in a smoldering pile of wrecked vehicles. Birds fall out of the sky. Sunflowers and Cherry Blossoms bloom together.<br /><br />A secret meeting of military leaders is hastily convened in the SITUATION ROOM beneath Tokyo headquarters. Bright maps line a massive rotunda. Tiers of computers fluoresce. On a plateau, Generals gather around a map of Japan. Mr. Narasaki, head of Nishibashi Pharmaceuticals and Nirasaki of Development brief them of the situation, that an employee named Nobuo Tanaka is bringing the drug and all related materials to the Headquarters. He is the only survivor of the pharmaceutical company. The Japanese General scolds Mr. Narasaki loudly. Nobuo Tanaka is the lone survivor and he is bringing the samples directly to Headquarters?<br /><br />All westbound traffic on Chuoh Freeway has been cut off. Eastbound traffic is at a standstill. And sensors in the disaster area have indicated that the center of the disaster is moving towards the heart of Tokyo. To make matters worse, all the chaos and death is making Nobuo nervous and the drug he took reacts to his metabolism; the more afraid he gets, the more dangerous he becomes. No matter what, he must be made as calm as possible, which is not an easy thing to do with the Japanese Forces bearing down. They must stop the cloud of stench from reaching Tokyo at all costs.<br /><br />Of the three episodes on Memories, Stink Bomb is the lightest in terms of execution and mood, a black comedy in the tradition of DR. STRANGELOVE. Here the `Doomsday Device' is a young chemist with lethal B.O. Stink Bomb seizes on the Anthrax scare by creating the ultimate biological weapon, a scared human.<br /><br />Stink Bomb is unabashedly stereotypical. The Japanese General is short and feisty while the U.S. General is a cool and constructed on a massive scale.  The Japanese would like to destroy the weapon's courier, America would prefer to capture the subject. Ground zero is the WAR ROOM, not map coordinates or the general populace.<br /><br />There is an awesome display of detail in the movie's military hardware. There are tanks identical to the Type 90 MBT (main battle tank) of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force. A scene on national route 20 shows a convoy of these machines; steel sprockets rotate caterpillar tracks. When the commander in one of the tanks spots Nobuo, the turret rotates in the center of the hull and the main gun pivots on the target. This sequence affords a 3D view of the tank's armature: the 120mm main gun; grenade dischargers mounted on the sides of the turrets; co-axial machine guns mounted above and behind the main gun and overhead views of the hatches, periscopes and cupolas. A scene inside one of the tanks shows the commander and gunner in the front section of the hull, on either side of the Main Gun's enormous breech. Profiles show the steel `skirts' overlapping the caterpillar tracks.<br /><br />And jets are also on display including the F15J, the Japanese variant of the U.S Air Force's F15C. The engines are shown starting up, turbine vanes rotate, nozzles expand and afterburners feed white-hot exhaust blasting out the back. In flight there's a panoramic view of other jets, the sky and clouds. A transparent display (HUD) grid is projected on the cockpit window. The pilot pulls and pushes the center-mounted joystick and adjusts the throttle with the left joystick. Rudders tilt in opposite directions and the wings become vertical offering a view of the plane's underside. Radar pods are mounted near the inlets and sidewinder missiles are clustered against its plate-welded belly.  Flaps on the vertical and horizontal portions of the tail pitch the nose in every direction.<br /><br />The American spacesuit in Stink Bomb is modeled after AX-5, a NASA prototype. It is similar to NASA's current EMU except that the limbs and torso are `hard' spheres articulated by basketball-sized joints (bearings) to allow free movement.<br /><br />Astronauts are transported by Naval helicopter to the Takao Mountains where the Japanese army has Nobuo trapped in a partially collapsed tunnel. The U.S. officer gloats that the astronauts' suits are impregnable from all types of radiation. In this scene every feature of a real space suit is duplicated. Oxygen hisses out of elbow ducts. They have sleeve-mounted keypads. High-pressure hoses slither out of their bodies into huge backpacks equipped with helmet lights. Their hinged, iron feet plant solidly with each step and a metallic tint crackles over their visors as they enter the tunnel.<br /><br />The final episode of Memories is a very brief tale called Cannon Fodder, written and directed by Katsuhiro Otomo.<br /><br />A canon on a medieval castle shatters a kingdom, the broken pieces come together and the process is restarted. The camera pulls back from the clock shaped headboard. An iron-colored boy throws the covers back.<br /><br />The child hops up, slips into a green army jacket and a red helmet. In the hall he pauses to gaze up at an enormous portrait, that of a Prussian commander posing beside a cannon. The interior of the home is a riveted, airtight cave. Pipes run parallel, branching, knotting and twisting, dividing and subdividing from floor to ceiling. Hot steam is sneezed out of safety valves. The family-- father, son and mother are almost invisible. Their complexions are as dull as the solder linking the pipes around them. Mom hands them both steel lunchboxes. Dad dons his helmet and pulls on his pale-blue tunic. The open frame of the elevator shaft provides a citywide view. Every steel and stone building is scorched, every rooftop near and far has a cannon.<br /><br />A haze of acrid smoke dissipates, consecutive doors on a giant train pop open. Gray men dismount and trudge down the pier in double file behind sections of propaganda. The slogan: NO CONQUEST WITHOUT LABOR is plastered on every surface with the `s' spelled with Waffen double lightning bolts.  They clock in one by one and pull on respirators.<br /><br />In another scene, children in pickelhaubes listen vaguely as the teacher lectures them on cannon shooting. The son gazes out the window, longingly at a small, gray planet. It is, in fact, the domed turret of cannon number 17.  The long barrel extended through the turret slot where inside it is mounted to an enormous edifice. The workers on it are specks. A hasty gun-loading drill is called. An army of laborers scramble to their tasks. An elephant-sized bullet is rolled out. A crane hoists it to the platform where it is carefully lined up and rammed into the breech. A rail platform rolls out with the charge canister. The crane hoists it to the platform and rams it in behind the projectile. The temperature of the charge is checked, also the air temperature and wind currents. A circular platform rotates the enormous carriage as the barrel is elevated.<br /><br />The loaders hustle off the floor and gather at the observation window. A round, dignified officer appears from one of the tunnels. His chest is decorated with medals. His pickelhaube is golden and his red cape is flowing behind him.<br /><br />He stops beside the cannon and a lift rises out of the floor and sets him up on the cannon's platform. He strides past the breech and up to the plateau along the shaft, up to a small pedestal labeled 17. A panoramic scene shows the dome's interior walls, the laborers at the observation window and the turret slit, down the cannon and back to the shooter. The long muzzle aimed at the empty sky. The shooter tosses his cape and snaps on his facemask. He draws the switch and BOOM! A cloud of fire and smoke explodes over the city. Female laborers in military formation salute the cannon from a nearby factory. Acids burn the air.<br /><br />Another scene shows the father being punished for a mistake on the loading platform. He and his team are ordered to stay out in the shooting area. Again, the shooter appears, indifferent to the laborers lined across the platform. The energy released from the cannon is awesome. A scene falls from the scorched clouds. Down stratified buildings with turrets on every level and cannons aimed in all directions. Along tarnished networks of lead ducts and plumbing to the stiff atmosphere of the world below. The view floats through the window of a family resting from a day's labor. Propaganda blares from the radio.  Cannon blasts of the day are tallied. Dad and son are at the kitchen table. Son is applying crayons to a crude drawing of an Imperial Shooter. Dad is engrossed by the small, metal television. Mother, who's at the sink calls out. It'll be lights out soon. The iron-colored boy asks his father one last question: who were they shooting? He'll understand, his father tells him... when he's older.<br /><br />Cannon Fodder depicts a Reich society where ideologues and machines rule tiny people. War and paranoia occupy every moment. Valves, gauges and primitive machines are aesthetic. Home is a pressurized hull. And rooms are modular units separated by bulkheads.<br /><br />Life is dull. But each member of the unit has a purpose: mom works in an assembly line in an ordnance factory. Son studies cannon shooting physics in school. And father's job is loading.<br /><br />Coal and steam pollutes everything. Giant locomotives belch thick, dirty clouds onto crowded platforms. Respirators are fashion accessories. Cobbled streets and stone buildings are smoked with ash. Faces are grim and eyes are stamped with hard rings.<br /><br />Cannons blossom over the streets daily. From the tallest structure and longest muzzle the scene beyond the kingdom is a pocked wasteland. By the end an air raid siren is completely ignored.<br /><br />Cannon 17 in Cannon Fodder is a slight exaggeration (very slight) of the `Gustav Geschutz' siege gun that Hitler employed ordnance maker Alfried Krupp to construct. He wanted a `super-gun' that could pierce a meter of steel, seven meters of concrete and thirty meters of compact earth!<br /><br />Alfried Krupp's company was the epicenter of German rearmament during World War 2. In Essen, an industrial city in northwest Germany, he owned some of the biggest machines in the world. Piercing presses weighing 1,500 tons, 2,500-ton drawbenches, turning lathes, furnaces, in-house electrical and water plants. In 1941 Krupp produced a gun capable of firing 8-ton shells and hitting targets thirty miles away! The tube and breechblock encompassed half a football field. A giant axle gear pivoted the 800mm muzzle, and a carriage, two twenty-axle bogies and two parallel sets of tracks supported a machine weighing 1,350-tons, four stories off the ground.<br /><br />Hitler's original plans for the gun was to crush the network of bunkers along the German frontier France had built between 1920-1936 following the Versailles Treaty. But Germany's panzer divisions, under General Erich von Manstein, plowed through the harsh Ardennes wilderness and outflanked France.<br /><br />Crimea, a peninsula south of Ukraine and north of the Black Sea, became a suitable target for the Gustav weapon. Hitler used it to destroy Russian fortifications at Sebastopol and Kerch. A spur of four semicircular tracks was attached to the Simeropol/Sebastopol Railway. The gun's muzzle was pointed at the line of forts around Sebastopol Bay. When the shelling ended, Sebastopol's population of 80,000 had been decimated to 200 by 30,000 tons of artillery, 50 tons day and night for 25 days. Of this, 300 eight-ton shells came from the Gustav. Sebastopol was obliterated and on July 1 '41 Germany seized this important Russian position.<br /><br />But in Cannon Fodder an enormous gun fires at an unknown enemy. Fluffed clouds lie like bunkers on the horizon. Cannon Fodder's main gun becomes a giant metaphor for technology and ideology. Its laborers are reduced to gunpowder, a blind, potent, unthinking force.<br /><br />In Cannon Fodder war is God. A boy stands beneath the portrait of a Prussian Commander, profiled heroically beside a cannon. Bare metal walls are devoid of color and art. War movies play inside of rifled gun tubes. Workers march in file. Giant guns are worshipped with straight-arm salutes. Music is dangerous. In one scene, a small boy is punished and taken away for having a music helmet. War slogans `no conquest without labor' and `KO to the enemy' plaster public buildings. All schooling and labor is centered on the war effort.<br /><br />Cannon Fodder is an analogue of Nazi Germany. Stairs running parallel zigzag at wide angles like those in Ludwig's villa. A cobblestone circle is almost identical to Karlsplatz Square and there's a junction that is very similar to the East-West axis Hitler planned for Berlin.<br /><br />The Neoclassical style of architecture was used in Cannon Fodder. Hitler was fond of this style for public buildings and commissioned architect Albert Speer to design them on Roman models of permanency, of granite and marble and scaled to monumental proportions. Throughout Cannon Fodder people are juxtaposed with mountain-sized buildings and machines and showed from distances to give the impression of insignificance in relation to the whole as Hitler intended for German citizenry.

B000022TSW|5.0|Ok, the movie is vulgar. But it's not that vulgar. HOnestly. Whenever a movie comes out that is animated and it's not appropriate for children people freak out calling it the most inappropriate film ever. There have been much worse films in terms of vulgarity. Shall we say American Pie. Yet since that was not animated no one made a big deal. South PArk is ruthelessly funny and truthful. And the musical numbers are better then many musical numbers in the most classic of disney films. IT's awsome and if your kid is a teenager he can see it. He's either heard or seen worse. Trust me.
B0002RQ2T4|5.0|Ghost in the Shell-- poses the question, \\"What makes us human?\\" through the personage of a sleek, sexy cop made of mechanical parts. She's among a new class of cyber-humans and an operative of the Shell Squad. Motoko Kusanagi can access any site or brain on the web via USB sockets on the back of her neck. She is partnered with a fresh recruit named Togusa whose cybernetic brain has just enough gray matter to make him `human'; Ichikawa, the oldest member, spends most of his time alone on the Net; and Batou, a blonde, surly tank serves as Kusanagi's right-hand-man and is completely cybernetic.<br /><br />In an unidentified Asian metropolis, ribbons of silicon and concrete tie skyscrapers and corporate networks together. A shadow organization creates a program called Puppet-Master or Project 2501 for industrial espionage and intelligence manipulation. The Puppet-Master becomes sentient, however, and escapes his physical body by uploading his mind into the Internet. There he monitors Kusanagi's (Motoko) online activities and allows himself to be captured. She uplinks with him and is forced to confront the meaning of her own existence; what does it mean to be human? Does the presence of a \\"ghost\\" or soul constitute life, even if that soul is in a synthetic shell?<br /><br />The cityscape of Ghost in the Shell is so detailed that, at times, it's as though acetate was laid over actual maps and traced. Skewed angles transform vertical highways into prisms. Lights fleck rippling water, reflections skate across panes of glass. The look of the film draws a razor-sharp line between upper and lower society, juxtaposing hard, silvery skyscrapers and high-tech gadgets against the grimy tones of urban existence. This cinematography is reminiscent of the movie that started cyber-punk, Blade-Runner. Lengthy utterances on the duality of human and machine existence are interspersed with loud, beautifully styled action sequences. The running time (85 minutes) is probably the only downside to this anime.

B000002G87|4.0|This is a classic album in the music world, and no one needs me to make such an announcement. However, it is, in all honesty, spotty in some respects. \\"Key to the Highway\\" is good, but the drug binge that this entire band had been on during its recording in a Miami, Florida hotel room is very evident in Clapton's voice and somewhat evident in his playing. \\"Layla\\" still hits the mark, even though, again, Clapton sounds like he's ready to fall apart. In fact, he admitted to all of this in an authorized biography twenty years ago, and he admitted that it would have been much better had he, Duane Allman, and the rest of the group been not so wasted during most of its recording. Nevertheless, it still makes for a very good listen overall and has withstood the test of time easily.
B00004SCX6|4.0|While \\"Britney\\" and \\"...Baby One More Time\\" were both better than this album, I still think it's good.  I hate Britney Spears personally, but I like her music, at least her older stuff. <br /> <br />1. Oops!...I Did It Again!- This song was extremely controversial when it came out, and still is today.  Not Brtiney's best song, but it's not so bad.   <br /> <br />2. Stronger- I think the tune of this song is okay, but Britney sounds sort of constipated.  No offense. <br /> <br />3. Don't Go Knockin' On My Door- This one's fun to dance to!  The words are horrible (ex- \\"You and I, we're like so 'bye-bye'\\", but it has a great tune! <br /> <br />4. Satisfaction- This is a horrible cover.  How dare Britney even try to compete with the Stones?  *Shakes head in disgust* <br /> <br />5. Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know- This is a nice, slow song.  The words are pretty good, and Brit's voice is okay as well. <br /> <br />6. What U See(Is What U Get)- This song reminds me of \\"Oops!\\" in a way.  It's okay. <br /> <br />7. Lucky- I remember, I was nine when this song came out, and I was obsessed with it.  Fortunately I am over that *Phew!*  It's a good song, still, however. <br /> <br />8. One Kiss From You- Filler. <br /> <br />9. Where Are You Now?- BRITNEY?!  No way!!  The voice is too amazing, the words are too realistic, the tune is too well written.  However, this is her, and I love it!  Great song! <br /> <br />10. Can't Make You Love Me- Filler. <br /> <br />11. When Your Eyes Say It- This is a good song!  Of course, it was written by the lovely Diane Warren.  It's great. <br /> <br />12. Dear Diary- Horrible.  Ugh.
B000059T00|5.0|Whenever I hear this album, I become somewhat dismayed that this group could not have stayed together longer. The chemistry between its members is fabulous, and this was probably the last time in his career that Eric Clapton is heard playing a screaming Gibson guitar just as he did with Cream, especially on \\"Had to Cry Today\\". And yet the acoustic \\"Can't Find My Way Home\\" also hits the mark, albeit in a much more subtle fashion. This song is actually a forerunner of MTV's \\"Unplugged\\", obviously unbeknownst to anyone back in 1969. This is one of those albums that is absolutely timeless-and nearly flawless, as well.
B0000E1ALR|5.0|No matter how many songs are included in a package like this, it's always the ones that are missing that stick in your mind.  For me, it's \\"One Step Up\\".  For someone else, it may be \\"Cadillac Ranch\\" or \\"Racing In The Street\\", etc.  Until Bruce Springsteen releases an all encompassing box set of mammoth proportions, however, we can consider ourselves well served with this 3 disc set. It presents an accurate picture of one of the most influential singer/songwriter/musicians of the past 30 years, and cleans up the sound to boot. A remastering of Springsteen's catalog is long over due; in the meantime, \\"Essential\\" does a decent job at putting a nice shine on some of the more compelling, memorable songs ever to grace a turntable, tape or CD player. For long time and casual fans alike.
B000002H33|5.0|This is Metallica's best album, and likely the best album in heavy metal history.  It manages to retain much of the hard, heavy edge of Kill 'em All and Ride the Lightning, while adding in more subtle, distortion-free guitar riffs.  These give pieces of the album, for example the introduction to \\"Battery,\\" an epic sound.  One that leaves you awestruck.  It has the magnitude of an orchestra, with the sharp heavy volume of metal. This album has plenty of the loud,  strong, raw anger for which Metallica is known, in songs such as Leper Messiah, while still showcasing Metallica's quieter, yet somehow more disturbing side in songs like Sanitarium.  This album is at times scary, such as in \\"Thing  That Should not Be,\\" at times angry, even at times quiet.  In the intro to Battery, and in the instrumental Orion, it showcases Metallica's epic sound.  This was Cliff Burton's farewell, and he proved himself deserving of the legendary status he has achieved.
B0002858YS|4.0|Interesting that most of this album's criticism comes from it being 'popular' and 'mainstream'. Similar artists who sound pretty much the same receive less bashing...If it is really about the music, than mainstream should have nothing to do with popularity. Indie kids hold dear their esoteric music, and turn from it when it gains popularity and loses its obscure luster. I too scrunched my nose at The Killers at first. Their first two singles, \\"Somebody Told Me\\" and \\"Mr. Brightside\\" were annoying to me. I found that the album has better songs to offer than their biggest hits; standouts include \\"Jenny was a friend of mine\\", \\"Smile Like You Mean it\\", and \\"All These things that I've done\\" are SOLID and very fun pieces of synth pop-rock...Think Duran Duran tuned up and modernized a notch. Now that radios have turned 'brightside' and 'somebody..' off of repeat, I have come to enjoy these songs more as well. The first 5 songs on the album are a powerhouse of exciting and catchy and dance-worthy and sing along rock. The remainder of the album is nothing to scoff at. The songs are well enough on there own. In fact, they would be quite worthy pieces on their own, their downfall is in the comparison of the first 5 powerhouse singles. At 45 minutes of individually worthy tracks, the album is well worth buying as a whole. The album loses one star, since albums I associate with 5-stars are more than catchy; they are lyrically significant and superior to the songwriting of this album.
B0000028RR|5.0|RATM managed to combine some of the greatest guitar riffs written with excellent drums, some skilled if simple bass work, and kick-ass lyrics.  Tom Morello (now in Audioslave) is among the best guitarists rock has seen, possibly the best in modern rock.  Add in Zach de  la Rocha's powerful lyrics combined with his awesome rap-like delivery and it gives Rage a truly unique, awesome sound.
B000089CJI|4.0|This CD is worth the buy for \\"Such Great Heights\\"..But dont buy the single, there are enough good songs otherwise to warrant purchasing the full album. 'We Will Become Silhouettes' is my personal favorite, along with the 'The District Sleeps Alone', 'Such Great Heights', and 'Sleeping In'.   I really want to give this song 4.5 stars...It isn't AMAZING, but it's pretty darn close. I could say it is a little too 'cutesy' at times.    Rating: 8.6/10.0
0553573403|3.0|George R.R. Martin is a revolutionary in Fantasy writing because he does not hold himself as a slave to the plots laid out by a few before him (Lovecraft and Tolkien.)  This series is full of intrigue, political power plays, back stabbing and all of the other menuevers that make fantasy so interesting.  The plot is thick, and can be enthralling, but only if you can figure out what it is.  I say this because the book is so packed with seemingly mindless sex and violence that it is quite easy to become distracted from what is really going on.  He goes into great detail, in his excellent smooth writing style, about all the sensuousness, or lack there of, of the charachters' numerous sexual encounters, and goes into extreme gorey description during every battle.  If you are easily distracted or offended, you should definitely avoid this book (you might want to pick a different genre too!)  If, on the otherhand, you are looking for something intriguing, and believe that you will be able to see past all of the \\"distractions\\" I highly reccomend this book.  It is well written, and rather enjoyable.
B00000DG1R|4.0|So this is from where The Killers, The Bravery, Action Action, and all the new-wave electronica/synth pop of today draw their influences.  <br />Great fun. :) <br /> <br />In my opinion, this band isnt more of a \\"hidden treasures\\" band, where their little-known songs are greatest. I have heard most of the work, and since this is a pop band, the catchy ones work best. Thus, the catchy hits they produce are their best, so this CD is the best pick.
B000009ED0|5.0|This CD arrived fast and in exellent condition. I have purchased several item at Amazon.com and have no problems.
B0006399FS|1.0|The hype even fooled me!!! <br /> <br />I really thought that they could release another great album after 2000's dissapointment ATYCLB, but sadly HTDAAB is even more disapointing, oh well better luck next time guys!!!!
6305754969|5.0|this is one of the many GREAT John Wayne films. it is helped by a star studded cast including a very young James Caan (Mississippi) and another legend of the big screen Robert Mitchum who plays Waynes old acquaintance who has turned town drunk/sheriff. All three give stellar performances! my only dissapointment with this movie was the lack of extra's but it still is worth every penney and more. this movie is a must have for even the slightest western Connoisseur!
0393307050|5.0|I realize that I am hardly the first to recognize the late Patrick O'Brian as one of the best historical novelists of our time, but I must give credit where it's due.  Master & Commander is a brilliant and authentic story, and I look forward to continuing my first journey through the Aubrey/Maturin series.  As I say above, my only regret is that it took me so long to start this journey.<br /><br />Master & Commander begins with an argument, the parties to which are, quite unknowingly, about to become great friends.  But as much as this book is about the relationship between Captain Jack Aubrey and his ship's surgeon, Stephen Maturin, it is at the same time a very authentic look into the life in the British Royal Navy at the beginning of the 19th Century.  This is not an action thriller that is full of graphic description of naval battles, nor should it be.  It is instead a very real look at life in a very different time and place than our current existence.<br /><br />That is not to say that reading this book is not a bit of work.  The author assumes a familiarity with nautical terms...and nautical terms as they were used in the early 1800s, not in the year 2005.  I have been raised around boats my whole life, but frequently found myself referring to the dictionary to figure out the meaning of certain terms.  This may sound arduous, but there are a lot of good resources online (many with ties to the Aubrey/Maturin series), and I found it fun to learn some of the factual background while reading the novel.<br /><br />I will readily admit this is book is not for everyone (and certainly not for anyone without any interest in the historical period or topic).  But, if you are interested in the topic, have the desire to learn as you work through the book, and are a fan of truly original, creative, and downright clever authoring, this book...and no doubt series (keeping in mind that I'm only 300 pages into the second book)...are for you.
B000006TRV|5.0|This album is just as great as I remember it in high school!
B0009RCPY8|5.0|GHOSTBUSTRS!!! <br /> <br />I love these movies.  They constantly make me laugh, eventhough I have seen them like 10,000 times.  Highly recommend to anyone who hasn't seen them.
B0001RVTXO|4.0|This is the second compilation from the Pixies... a bit too much for the band, that released just 4 full length albums (plus one b-side collection, one EP and one BBC-sessions disc). <br />Collection is good, but it's near impossible to extract wrong songs from Pixies' portfolio, 'cause this band had no weak songs. <br />And my main question: <br />WHERE IS ... no, no MY MIND - I must say: WHERE IS RIVER EUPHRATES??
B0007WZUMO|5.0|For all those who say Trent just doesn't have it anymore.  I say BAH!  This is a great album, in the classic NIN style.  I give props to Trent for constantly re-inventing himself and his music.
B00004YTIQ|2.0|This item did not stay on the pool.  If the wind blew, it flew off.  We ended up having to buy a different one.  Don't waste your money on this one!
B0001NBMBC|5.0|i've never eally been into the hole heavy mettal stuff,but my bf was.he literaly worshiped slipknot.one day he was playing it and i actualy liked the song i asked him who they where and he said slipknot.l8er that week i bought their cd and rocked out 2 it all day. i soon started to love their music and gotinto it.most ppl think that if it's slipknot it's nothing but screaming and that's not ture. if u acyualy listen to the music it can tend to speak out 2 u and have a meaning and if u can see that then maby u should bye their cd 2.seriously tho ppl bye their cd!!!!!!!!!
B0009KA7BS|1.0|Train Wreck adaptation of the vertigo comic book that has Keanu Reeves of all people playing the role of supernatural troubleshooter John Constantine, who with the help of a cop (played by Rachel Weisz) tries to stop the forces of evil from taking over the world. The script first off is so badly written that you can see the expressions on the actor's faces that they themselves can't believe on the things that they are made to say. The story makes absolutely no sense what so ever and it manages to go against itself in certain parts of the film and the climax literally destroys the entire film with one of the worse plot twist in recent memory. The direction lacks focus and certain scenes either go no where in terms of furthering the story along or are just so badly put together that you have no idea of what is going on from time to time. The acting is not very good either, with Keanu Reeves not only degrading the role of John Constantine with his stare into space demeanor but he manages to make it into a poor mans version of Dirty Harry with the delivery of his lines. He is either trying to channel Clint Eastwood into his performance or a he's a mentally retarded man who is the butt of a very cruel joke by the studio who made this film. The only decent piece of acting in this film comes from Rachel Weisz who gives way too much talent and grace with a performance that is way too deep and complex for a film that is this poorly made. Her haunting performance could have been the basis of a much better and complex horror movie and that would have been a film that I would have liked to have seen other than the train wreck that is this film. The other great performance belongs to Peter Stormare, whose three-minute cameo is a classic.  <br /> <br />Other than Weisz and Stormare, The bad word of mouth for this movie is justified.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|The Firefly series was very enjoyable. I loved the characters and couldn't wait to continue the story, until I found out they lasted only one season! I hope the debut of their movie (Serenity) will encourage someone to start up the series again. <br />
B0002S94OS|4.0|Lamb of God are definitely at the forefront of the American metal scene. They combine old-school metal with some of the \\"newer\\" hard-core death metal elements. This cd is solid all the way through and won't dissapoint the average metal-head. All things aside though, this cd is pretty tame compared to New American Gospel, quite possibly the best metal album to come out in the last 5 years. So that's why I only gave it 4 stars.
B0009A1AS2|3.0|Too many side projects and not enough focus on DT...this album has some cool moments, without question.  But overall, it's inconsistent.  James Labrie's has some great vocal moments and Mike Portnoy continues to wow, Petrucci's solos, normally the highlight are lacking creativity and Ruddess's keyboards are too techno and too chintzy.  I'm enjoying this album, but I loved, LOVED LOVED, nearly everything else they've put out.  Just doesn't compare to the rest.
0312997221|2.0|Let me start off by saying I used to be the greatest Forsyth fan. I loved his earlier books like Dogs of War, Day of the Jackal etc. Forsyth's obvious depth and expertise in European cold war intricacies made his books a thrill to read. Most of all, his objective writing without overly glorifying anything lent credence to his books.   That is exactly why I was disappointed in 'Avenger'. While it starts off promisingly enough, gone are Forsyth's cold, analytical plot setups. Instead we have clancy-esque jingoism that idolizes anything and everything American. His admiration for Reagan and Bush and disdain for the EU seeps through in almost every page. Even the action scenes sound too contrived - I swear there were moments I thought I was reading the usual garbage Clancy writes - as when he writes banal lines like &#34;the thug met his maker&#34; - when did Mr Forsyth degenerate to writing inane lines like this?   I hate it when authors suddenly have a change in philosophy in their later lives, and decide to impose it on their readers. I also used to be a fan of Wilbur Smith, until he decided to start ranting in his books about South Africa's political woes. It is sad to see excellent authors who are reduced to conservative talk show hosts. I live in Texas and get enough of it on my AM stations - thank you.   Here's a tip - WE BUY YOUR BOOKS FOR THRILLS - SO PLEASE LEAVE YOUR POLITICS AT HOME AND DONT BORE US WITH THEM ...
B00000FCBC|5.0|This was the last Metallica album that i bought. i must say, i waited way to long. There is no original Metallica material on this CD, and that makes it way better than any of their new stuff. They cover songs by such artits as Blue Oyster Cult, Mercyful Fate, Motorhead, The Misfits(Note my user name) Queen, Budgie, The Anti-Nowhere League, and the Immortal Black Sabbath. These song's were amazing when they were done by the original artist's, and Metallica has brought them all together on this awesome recording. And it doesn't nurt that they pay tribute to some of the most influential metal bands ever, which they are one of by the way.
B000002I7H|4.0|CD arrived in sealed jewel case, new, and was without flaws.  The music was great, as expected, and the artist lived up to his reputation as one of the truly fine blues pickers.
0975991477|5.0|Read this book while taking an Intro to Biology course and you are in for a ride! The mind-expanding insights are fresh, even startling. Dr. Lipton's comparison of the cell's plasma membrane to a CPU is amazing. He shows why the nucleus is more like a hard drive than the hackneyed cliche of a cell's brain. The updated understandings you gain will make this book a very valued resource in your study of biology. Buy a second copy for your teacher!
B00005RHGK|2.0|Watching the beginning of this movie showed much promise in a complete and well made horror movie that was long over due.  Boy, was I wrong.  By the end of the movie I felt disapointed and disguised about a movie that didn't even come close to bringing the horror genre back from the gutters. A poor excuse for a horror film.
1932907009|5.0|My bookshelves groan with Screenwriting books. I can't resist them. I just wish I'd read Save The Cat first. I've a background in advertising and I can confidently predict that STC will be another 'Hey, Whipple' i.e. an instant classic that sets the standard for years to come. Why? Well, for a start, it successfully achieves that most difficult balance of being simple without being basic. It's also entertaining. Even things like giving odd names to screenwriting techniques - Pope in the Pool anyone?  - clarify ideas so much more vividly than using chapters of description. Most of all, STC is instantly USEFUL. I used the techniques in the book to build from the logline up a screenplay I'd been picking at for months. It was as if a giant lightbulb had gone off and made everything so much clearer. I wish the book was my little secret but unfortunately the word is already out there - hence the review. Final word? Stop what you're doing. Read this book. Then start again properly.
B0006399FS|1.0|This is what happens when an overated band does an overated album!!    The biggest shock is that I'm not the only one who saw this!!!    U2 were great with Joshua Tree & Achtung Baby but other than War could you say they've done anything else spectacular???    No!!!!    I can't believe people try and say they're up there with Zeppelin, or even more humoursly The Beatles. I mean Zeppelin only released 8 albums, and 6 were classics!!!    Also best band of the eighties??? Don't make me laugh!!!    I think you'll find that title belongs to a British band called The Smiths who in their short five year career released 5 albums, all classics, and also recorded B-sides that would have even made The Beatles jelous!!!!    Not to say I dislike U2!!!    I have all their albums from War to this, and I enjoy all of them (except their albums from 2000 onwards!!!) but since the 21st century started they've been more about 3 minute songs designed for the radio, or crapy TV programmes than actual meaningful music, and the i-pod is the biggest sell out ever!!!!!    They've forgotten the fans who made them famous in the first place, and why everyone loved U2. It was for Bono's war cry against all things wrong in the world, back then Bono would speak and we'd listen because we all releated to what he was saying.    But now Bono has something to say but it isn't to do with us, it's about \\"Liking the sound of his voice\\" \\"Wanting love without romance\\" It is meaningless drivel by a man who now seems more obsessed with his persona than his music!!!    The U2 I knew died a long time ago, but until now it was hard to accept, I'm sure by 2008, Bono will continue saying how great he is, and trying to say it's hard when you're rich, bla bla bla, but sadly he will have one less person listening to his drivel!!!    RIP U2  1983-1997
0800141660|5.0|I saw this film with my mom and we were both blown away by how good it was. The acting was marvelous and the whole story was to die for!!! I love this movie so much, and can now call it one of my favorites. The music, the production, everything was so well done!!! 10 stars!!! Jane Austin at her best!!!
B00000IMYA|5.0|In 1956, Duke Ellington's career had taken a downturn.  Swing was very old music, no longer well accepted, and many relics of the big band era had already disappeared.  Ellington maintained his orchestra, but with several key members of the band coming and going and gigs getting leaner, things were not looking good for the future.    It was into this environment that Ellington arrived at the Newport Jazz Festival that July, and the performance is the stuff of legend.  Ellington's set was reasonably well received, then during the bridge linking \\"Diminuendo in Blue\\" to \\"Crescendo in Blue\\", Paul Gonsalves stood up for his tenor solo.  Gonsalves, younger than the majority of Ellington's musicians and influenced by bebop players, began blowing fiercely, a powerful, evocative, non-linear solo that grabbed everyone's attention and made heads turn.  Realizing he had something going on, Ellington signalled Gonsalves to keep playing, chorus after chorus, as the crowd became more and more consumed by the music.  When the piece was finally done (a nearly fourteen minute performance, the majority of which consumed by Gonsalves' solo, unheard of in swing music), the crowd was positively frenzied and Ellington came out for several encores designed to calm them down.    On the strength of this performance and a cover appearance in Time Magazine, Ellington was suddenly a hot commodity, signed a deal with Columbia, and \\"Ellington at Newport\\" became his biggest selling record of all time.    So is Paul Gonsalves' solo really that good?  Well, yes, it is.  He plays magnificantly, and while it's clear he's starting to run out of steam when Duke finally lets him go, the truth is that this is what makes Ellington so powerful-- he can bring forth performances from musicians that can whip a crowd into a frenzy.  Truth is, there's powerful solos from any number of musicians, and I suspect had Ellington seen a crowd reaction when any of them were playing, he could have gotten the same reaction, be it Quentin Jackson's growling (\\"Black and Tan Fantasy\\"), Willie Cook (stunningly melodic and inventive on \\"Tea for Two\\"), the leader himself at the piano (\\"Take the A Train\\"), Cat Anderson's pyrotechnics (\\"Festival Junction\\") or Johnny Hodges' lyricism (\\"Jeep's Blues\\").  The crowd IS practically frenzied after Anderson takes off to the stratosphere at the end of \\"Festival Junction\\".  And I don't mean this to take away from Gonsalves-- his solo really is something to behold, but it's Ellington's arrangements and inspiration that's the star here.    So what is this set?  It's a chance to see a master bandleader at the top of his form, playing his orchestra as an instrument, and inspiring them to in turn inspire him.    This reissue is particularly exciting as it is the first to include the original sessions-- evidentally the tape was damaged and couldn't be salvaged in the '50s and parts of the performance were a bit less than perfect, so parts of the show were re-recorded, complete with artificial crowd noise and announcements (in many cases, the rerecordings are far superior to the less than perfect live performances, as one would suspect, but they lose some of the immediacy).  This release includes the original concert from a newly found tape and some of the studio sessions augmenting it as bonus material.  The sound is letter-perfect throughout-- this could have been recorded yesterday at a jazz festival and you'd scarcely hear the difference.  The set also includes extensive liner notes, including the original notes included with the set and new essays and session details.    In the end, this is one of the essential jazz recordings, certainly it's a fantastic introduction to Ellington's material and work, and it's among the best of his recordings.  Highly recommended.
B0009RCPY8|5.0|Ghostbusters and Ghosterbusters 2! Anyone who grew up in the early 90's is well framiliar with these two awsome adventures. <br />Alot of laughs (thanks to Bill Murray's improve and Harold Ramis and Dan Akroyd's clever script), some geuine scares and cool special effects that pump up the action, all come together to make two major players in Hollywood entertainment. With Ivan Reitman at the helm, these films were considered blockbusters at the time of their release and for good reason. This two disc set may not be chalk-full of endless special features, but the features that are included are super-cool enough to make this gift set well worth the purchase amount.   <br />On the first movie is included some deleted scenes, an extreamly informative commentary from some of the filmmakers and more goodies here and there. <br />On the second dvd, there is only one special feature, two full episodes from the popular cartoon show \\"The Real Ghostbusters\\" which both tie in in a neat way to the actual movies.  <br />The last feature that comes with this set is a movie scrapbook, which is very well done and includes alot of cool information about the making of the films and the back story of how the original idea for the movie was Dan Akroyd's, called 'Ghostsmahers' and featured him and the late John Belushi traveling through space smashing ghosts. <br />All in all, considering the low price of the set, this a great buy for fans of the films. Don't bother holding out for more special-feature related releases of the films. If they didn't do anything new for this gift set, they probably won't anytime soon.
B00000DLUV|5.0|If you're not a Bee Gees fan, or even not a music fan, I think that you are going to like this CD. There are 24 tracks and it covers exactly 78 minutes live music. This disc is timeless. The brothers Gibb take us on a journey through their history (1967-1997).     The Bee Gees start their live performance with \\"You Should Be Dancing\\" and they continue with their new song \\"Alone\\". The intro is one of the best intro's ever. The transition of the two songs is outstanding. Afterwards they sing songs from the beginning years like \\"Massachussetts\\" and \\"To Love Somebody\\". They let us go back to the sixties. Then, \\"Words\\" is incredible with the guidance of the piano. \\"Closer Than Close\\" is good although it isn't as famous as the other songs. It's one of the less songs in which Maurice has the lead vocals. They breathe new life into the famous duet between Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton, \\"Islands in the Stream\\".   Next, \\"Our Love\\" brings memories of their late youngest brother Andy. I had to shiver with this song. Afterwards, a mix of 2 songs of the movie \\"Saturday Night Fever\\", namely \\"Night Fever\\" and \\"More Than a Woman\\". The transition is great and the 3 voices are wow. \\"Lonely Days\\" is amazing because of the drums and the beat. \\"New York Mining Disaster 1941\\" is terrific because of the sound and the guidance of the guitar. Then, the Bee Gees play 6 songs, which is unfortunately short. It might be a disappointment, but still unforgettable. \\"I Can't See Nobody\\" (1:30), \\"And The Sun Will Shine\\" (1:54), \\"Nights On Broadway\\" (1:05), \\"How Can You Mend a Broken Heart\\" (3:26), \\"Heartbreaker\\" (1:05) and \\"Guilty\\" (2:20) are sung by the brothers standing close to each other behind one microphone. What a moment! To my opinion, the acoustic version of \\"Nights On Broadway\\" is better than the original one.   Next, a magical moment for the three and everyone, Cline Dion comes on stage and performs \\"Immortality\\" together with the Bee Gees. It must have been a surprise for the audience. The voice of Cline is harmonized with the background vocals of Barry, Maurice and Robin. Afterwards, \\"Tragedy\\" is remarkable because of the tune of the synthesizer, the drums and of course the voice of Barry. \\"I Started a Joke\\" stays a classic thanks to the voice of Robin. Next, \\"Grease\\", the main theme of the same named movie, was well performed. In the second couplet you hear the voice of Frankie Valli. Then, the recognizable beat and drums show it is time for some \\"Jive Talkin'\\". They end their concert with \\"How Deep Is Your love\\", \\"Stayin' Alive\\" and again \\"You Should Be Dancing\\", the 3 most famous songs of Saturday Night Fever.     On this CD you hear songs which were originally written for Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton, Dionne Warwick, Barbra Streisand and Frankie Valli. The Bee Gees have written songs that are timeless. Some songs are more than 30 years old. They will exist forever.   Not only the quality of the music but also of the presentation has left a great impression on me. Further, the performance by the band is outstanding. The voices of the brothers Gibb are as strong and resonant as they were 30 years ago. A very effective strategy was the use of \\"You Should be Dancing\\" to make the circle round, to finish the concert completely.   This CD proves the fact that the brothers Gibb aren't only one of the best songwriters and terrific singers, but also first-rate live performers and absolutely outstanding producers. This is their best live performance ever. They have recorded one of the best live albums ever made, or may I say, the best. Listen for yourself. The Bee Gees have released this album because of their world tour in 1997. Unfortunately, I have never been to any concert of them. At that time I wasn't a big Bee Gees fan as I am now.   When you eventually have listened to this CD and if you aren't one of the lucky persons who went to the concert, you'll be relieved there is a cure for this matter. Thank God there is also a DVD-release of this album. For those who haven't gone or couldn't go to the \\"One Night Only\\"-tour, you can or you must buy the DVD-release. It's the only way to see, listen and enjoy this concert at the same time! It's the only way to heal the wound.     Enough talking! Hurry up and purchase the CD and the DVD immediately. The two are collector's items. These 2 are really recommended. You won't need a second opinion. You won't regret it. Don't hesitate. This is it! Go on and buy it.
0679441018|5.0|Memnoch the Devil is easily the best of Anne Rices novels to date. Forget the bizzare reactions of the hardcore fanbase and concentrate on the great reviews it got from the mainstream press. It is a thoughtful book full of subtlety and grace.<br /><br /> Many people who misread the book constantly moaned about how Lestat was whining and weak. Lestat was confronted by the most powerful being he had ever met, inumerably more intelligent/physically strong/wise etc. Lestat's adventures had always been on his own terms and for once he is forced to accept that he has no control over the situation. Read and you won't be disappointed.
B0007LXPBI|4.0|I really enjoyed the original version of this movie, but I am a huge Dennis Quaid fan, I think he is a wonderful actor. I love the updates that they made to this movie. Ms. Lohan who has become the Disney it girl has really done a great job in this movie with her double role. I think that this movie is a great way to pass a calm Sunday afternoon.
B0002F7I9Y|3.0|I LOVE RAY CHARLES AND WAS EXCITED ABOUT THE DUETS, HOWEVER, I WAS DISAPPOINTED IN THE QUALITY OF SOME OF THE SONGS. RAY CHARLES VOICE WAS WEAK. I REALIZE HOW OLD HE WAS WHEN HE MADE THIS CD AND THAT PLAYED A PART IN IT, IT IS JUST SAD THAT THEY COULDN'T HAVE MADE A CD SOONER WHEN HIS VOICE WAS STRONGER. HAVING SAID THAT, SOME OF THE SONGS ARE STILL VERY GOOD SUCH AS THE ONE WITH ELTON JOHN AND SOME OF THE MORE BLUES SONGS.
B00003CXB4|5.0|The DVD has great quality, no choppiness at all. Once again Disney has created a masterpiece by re-mastering one of their best! The Lion King is a great movie for all ages and i will own it forever!
B00023B1A8|4.0|I picked up the Acoustic album in a moment of reminiscent nostalgia. While I enjoyed watching it and feel the recording deserves four stars, I found my nostalgia was satisfied before the end of the concert. This is a fine offering for someone who is a fan of CS&N but less so for someone who is just 'astral flashing.'
B0009HLDFU|4.0|I like the albums, particulary the acoustic side...but don't want to focus on that here.  There is an ipod workaround which is a pain, but I had to discover it the hard way when I bought the CD not knowing the problems that were ahead!   <br /> <br />If you try to load this album directly into iTunes, it'll recognize the CD and seem to operate as normal.  But when you play the songs back, they sound just plain WEIRD. <br /> <br />So, what you have to do is put the CD in your computer.  Make sure you have a current version of Windows Media Player.  Be sure to be online. The CD should load its software.  This will allow you to transfer the songs onto your computer...as .wmf files...not .mp3.  So, great, now you can listen on your computer without needing the CD, but still you can't use iPod. <br /> <br />So what you do now is use Media Player to burn these songs onto a new CD.  Make sure the original CD isn't in your computer anymore.  This \\"new\\" CD will now be recognized by iTunes, and you'll have no problem make useable iPod files at that time. <br /> <br />So, yes, it is a PAIN.  I think this \\"copy protection\\" is a p**sing contest between two big companies and we're caught in the middle. But I wanted to hear the album on my iPod, so I did the best I could.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|The Eagles have been honing their chops for decades and this performance reflects all that work. The band and backup musicians are so good it is stunning to hear and see. The lighting was dramatic and well represented on the recording. If you have any interest in the Eagle's music you can't go wrong with this package. Dare I say it? They are better than ever!
055321263X|5.0|Wilkie Collins story about a mysterious woman in white and her effect on the drawing teacher Walter Hartright, and his two students, Laura Fairlie and Marian Halcombe, first appeared in serial form.  It's easy to imagine 19th century readers eagerly looking forward to the next installment.  Through an effective use of foreshadowing, powerful character development, and diverse viewpoints presenting the story, the 569-page book retains suspense throughout.  Occasionally, the reader needs to suspend their belief, or to not pay too much attention to overdone or unrealistic details.  But the vast majority of the thick tome is a well-done mystery and an undeservedly hidden gem of a classic.
1400031087|5.0|A Million Little pieces is a brutally honest book about the struggles of addiction and the process of rehab.  I would recommend this as a read for anyone who has struggled with addiction and especially for those who are close to someone with an addiction problem.  James Frey writes so honestly that their were times when I had to clench my teeth to continue reading.  He reveals himself to the bone and beyond.  I found his story to be compelling.  Don't let this one slip by you.
0393324818|5.0|This is a very well-written and engaging book about a new approach to building a baseball team.  Some of the theories presented in this book are simply mind-blowing!  I came into reading this book with an open mind and found myself agreeing with a lot of what was presented.  However, I also disagreed with some aspects of the book and now I'm off to read its \\"counterpart,\\"  Scout's Honor (a Braves-centric book!). <br /> <br />The point is not, how many World Series have the Oakland A's won with their revolutionary approach.  The point is, what are they getting for their modest investment?  They're getting a great deal - for their team's budget you'd expect them to be permanently camped out in last place.  But instead here they are making a run for it yet another year.  Money alone can't buy a winning team or a World Series ring. <br /> <br />Don't believe me?  Go ask George Steinbrenner. <br /> <br />
B000001ABD|5.0|I don't have this CD but from the music previews, I can already see that this one is the better of his greatest hits album and collections.  Don't miss this one.
B00003CXXS|4.0|No, Michael Crichton did not write a book before this movie was made, and it shows.<BR>      This movie was all about action, and there wasn't much science stuff involved. The story is pretty simple, and there were some wacky part in this movie.<BR>      The raptors were radically changed; now they have feathers pointing out of their heads, there heads were a bit longer, and some part of them near their heads is PURPLE AND BLUE. I AM NOT JOKING. It looks dumb, and takes away from the movie. When I saw it, I'm just like, &quot;What the crap is that??&quot; Weird.<BR>      Another thing, the second movie was on Isla Sorna, and there was no sightings or mention of a Spinosaurus. Don't get me wrong, the Spinosaurus is my fave dinosaur in the JP series. That just seemed weird.<BR>      All in all, a great movie. A ton of fun, and it rocks. Buy the whole JP series, trust me, you'll like every single one!!!!
B00006BTCA|5.0|i cant stress how much better this album is than antics... <br /> <br />this is so much more mellow and faded where as antics is  much more hippity... <br /> <br />this is the perfect background music album, something to listen to when youre just chillin, or tryin to sleep... <br /> <br />everything about this album just flows seamlessly, and is irresistable to vibe to... <br /> <br />bottom line, i love this cd, buy it i think you will love it too... <br />
B00004U8JU|5.0|This is undeniably one of the best movies of all time. Every single aspect of this movie rocks!!!(Check out my reviews for the other JP movies.) As soon as/if JP4 comes out, I'm going straight to the theatre! Trust me, buy this movie.<BR>     OK, here's my review. The dinosaurs look awesome, the actors rock, and I was simply amazed. As well, there's this one particular part in the movie that made my spine tingle, the part where...<P(...)As far as the DVD goes, it totally rocks. Tons of special features, and the menu is greatly designed. The only disappointment about the menu is that there are only 20 scenes for a two hour movie!!! Some scenes last a long time. Meh. All in all, a great movie, great DVD... Five stars, very well earned!!!
B00005JNQS|4.0|If you remember Chris Wedge's previous work 'Ice Age,' you know what I am trying to say.  Like that enjoyable animation film, his new film 'Robots' offers striking visuals, but no orignal story.  Having said that, I find 'Robots' very entertaining. <br /> <br />The film begins when a new member arrives to the Copperbottoms family.  Actually, a robot boy is literally 'delivered' to them, and after long toilsome 'labor' our hero robot Rodney is born. <br /> <br />The situation is surely corny, but let's wait for a while.  The film barely succeeds in concealing that fact by giving some silly sight gags when Rodney grows up (yes, he grows ... don't ask me how) to be an amateur inventor.  Aspiring to be 'somebody' Rodney (voiced by Ewen McGregor without Scottish accent) goes to the big city called 'Robot City' where he thinks he can meet THE greatest inventor Doctor Bigweld (voiced by Mel Brooks). <br /> <br />Actually, as you know, what Rodney finds there turns out different.  Instead of seeing his dream come true, Rodney is treated bad (especially by the annoying guard voiced by Paul Giamatti).  Broken-hearted Rodney meets new friends there, one of whom is Fender (Robin Williams in his fast-talking mood), who gives some funny slapstick gags using his own body.  <br /> <br />Two things are memorable.  One of them is the film's visuals.  The color texture of the robots (including their nuts, screws, even the shadows) are realized with delicate touch, and the long shot showing the big city is simply beautiful.  Other great thing about the film is its voice cast, which includes, besides the players named above, Halle Berry, Drew Carey, Greg Kinnear, Jay Leno, James Earl Jones, Jennifer Coolidge, Diane Wiest, Stanley Tucii, Dan Hedaya, Natasha Lyonne, and Jim Broadbent.  Some of them appear, however, very short -- James Earl Johns as phone booth, for instance -- so do not miss their voices. <br /> <br />The jokes are not particualry new, and some of them are too tired, gross, or sexual, I am afraid, for the kids.  But still 'Robots' remains delightful to see throughout.  Not a gorundbraking effort, but entertaining nonetheless.
B00004U8JV|4.0|This is a pretty good movie, and I don't see why the average customer rating can be four or five stars. It's a great movie, except for the fact that the part(...)     Pretty good movie, all in all. Four stars.
B00004RFCM|5.0|What else is there to say? This is the ultimate show for girlfriends to watch together, to be hopeful together or to trash men together.  It's a show about friendships and relationships.  It's also one of the funniest shows I've ever seen.  And if you think that the episodes they are showing on cable now are good, wait until you see the unedited episodes from the DVDs!
B0009MDPYM|5.0|This is one of the best SFX movies ever made. Trust me, this is a sci-fi thriller beyond imagination! The monsters are great, the acting is great, and it is a bit scary at parts. BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!! It is amazing!!!

0714834491|5.0|<br />This is a book that anyone interested in design, philosophy or a laugh could not possibly tire of. Witty and intelligent, it is contains a wealth of information, delight and humour. It is jam packed with funny and inspirational quotes, random and interesting facts and philosophies. The design is fun and clever and full of all sorts of visual stimuli. This book will inspire you and make you THINK in a way that could hurt no-one and that you are bound to enjoy. Perhaps my favourite book to date.
B000008DXB|5.0|Well, this album rolls along like a river with the patented JJ groove.  Nothing leaps out at you like that catfish over there.  I can stare at the waves in a river a long time.  Maybe they get into my head in places I don't want to go.  Same sort of thing goes on with the songs here...I've worn out this album.  If you like it, you'll love it.  If not, maybe, when you feel like kicking back it's a good idea to give it another try.  Thanks JJ.
B0009S4IHY|4.0|Frequently the cinema world frowns upon slapstick, as it is a simple and unintelligent form of comedy.  However, Stephen Chow utilizes this variety of comic approach in his Kung Fu Hustle (known as Gong Fu in Asia) to perfection.  Slapstick finally finds its true purpose besides smashing pots and pans on top of people's heads, or pulling away chairs from seating people.  Chow takes it one-step further by inventing the new Shaolin Kung Fu style Slapstick, which willfully and intentionally beats up the audience with bellyaching laughter.<br /><br />\\"In a time of social unrest and disorder the gangs run amuck\\", is the opening description in regards to when the film takes place.  However, it is never clear exactly when, as periodically it feels mostly like the 1930s with moments from other time periods that are cleverly incorporated into the film.  The magic of cinema will remove the obstacle of time through Chow's creative fantasy approach and deliver a timeless journey into the small Pig Sty Alley where the story's heroes and crooks will converge in an epic comic battle of the kung fu fists and kicks.<br /><br />The Ax Gang rules the city while the police eagerly count their bribes.  The only ones that are an exception to corruption are the most unfortunate who reside in the poverty-stricken areas.  One of these areas is the Pig Sty Alley where this story unfolds when Sing (Stephen Chow) and his cheerful follower Bone (Lam Tze Chung) deceptively enters under the fake identity as Ax Gang members.  Sing's fraudulent plan backfires when the inhabitants of the Pig Sty Alley decide to oppose them, which pulls the real Ax Gang into the poor neighborhood as well.  Fortunately for the inhabitants of the Pig Sty Alley some very skilled kung fu masters have withdrawn from public attention into this poor neighborhood.  Thus, when the Ax Gang arrives, they are in for a surprise that will rock the corrupt society.<br /><br />The action is plentiful in Kung Fu Hustle to which some film critics has uttered dislike, but it is in the large amount of kung fu where the audience will discover an unpolished gem.  With the help of wire-fu, special effects and hilarious dialogues laughter will go through all its different gradients from muffled chuckles to full out laughing explosions.  It is within these fight scenes where the audience will uncover the crude jewel that ultimately will deliver a true cinematic gem through the admirable story line.<br /><br />Stephen Chow's story resembles a lot with Ren&eacute; Goscinny's and Albert Uderzo's comic book Ast&eacute;rix where one small village resists the whole Roman Empire.  The difference in Chow's film is mostly cultural, but it also has his own comic martial art touch to it.  There are also many spoofs on scenes from other films such as Matrix and some Spaghetti Westerns.  On top of the parody, Chow gives a full out slapstick assault to the kung fu genre that had its profound emergence in the 1970s.  Regardless of Kung Fu Hustle's similarities to other stories, Chow achieves an extraordinary film that delivers valuable messages such as forgiveness, honor, and love in the backdrop of a heavy dose of humor.some film critics has uttered dislike, but it is in the large amount of kung fu where the audience will discover an unpolished gem.

I have almost all the HD movies out there for Windows XP that I play on my Media Center PC hooked to my HD TV.  This is the only one that wont play, tech support was no help either.  That&#8217;s 4 different Window XP computers I tried to get this to play on and it won&#8217;t work.  The only reason I bought this DVD was for the HD version.
B0007TKNI8|5.0|I have seen Phantom in theaters but none of them measure up to the romance, passion and sexuality of the movie. And because of the younger cast, it's more appealing to the younger generation that perhaps cannot afford to see it at a theater. <br /> <br />For the first time, the Phantom comes across as Mr. GQ on one side and the Phantom on the other. His stature and masculinity make you desire him, despite his disfigured face. Unike past Phantoms, Gerard Butler has a strength in his voice that women find desirable. The way his chest rises and falls when he's close to Christine, the way his lips part in awe of her, is very, very romantic.  <br /> <br />Emmy Rossum, who plays Christine, offers the most innocent and beautiful portrayal of her character. Minnie Driver is hysterical. Patrick Wilson is like one of the guys off of the front page of a romance novel and Miranda Richardson adds such an important role to the movie. <br /> <br />I would like to call this a chick flick, but any guy with an open mind could relate to the passion of this movie. <br /> <br />It's best to watch it first with the subtitles so as to understand every word. If you get the collectors edition, make sure you watch all the special features as they are just as interesting as the movie. <br /> <br />I say BRAVO to the new Phantom of the Opera movie. <br /> <br />
B00005JNZ4|3.0|Must Love Dogs is not a bad romantic comedy, and it's only failure is the lack of chemistry and screentime shared between Diane Lane and John Cusack. This film is certainly more tailor-made for Lane, since she dominated most of the movie, and she's good, even if not as good as her previous career revival roles in Unfaithful and Under The Tuscan Sun. John Cusack is a bit underexposed and miscast for his part, and he's been far more enjoyable to watch in movies like High Fidelity or Bullets Over Broadway.<br /><br />Sarah(Lane) is divorced pre-school teacher and she's been encouraged by her family to get out and start dating again. She reluctantly goes on dates with men whom responded to an internet ad that was posted by her sister(Elizabeth Perkins). She had to go through a string of aweful first dates before meeting her ideal soulmate(Jake/John Cusack), who happened to be on the mend from an unpleasant divorce. He's the only guy that she went beyond the first date, but she's not ready to open herself emotionally. It was very funny to see them on the second date together when they had to drive all over town to buy condoms.  Meanwhile, she's got another potential boyfriend(Bob/Dermot Mulroney) trying to enter her life. Bob is a single \\"hot dad\\" whose kid happens to be Sarah's student, and they are obviously attracted to each other.<br /><br />Sarah's Dad(Christopher Plummer) also goes on serial dating women he met on-line. (Dolly)Stockard Channing is the one that truly fell for him, despite the fact that he's not serious about falling in love again after his departed wife. Channing stole scenes with her comic moments, especially in the scenes when she showed Sarah her ads on various websites and when a teenage guy came to see her after corresponding on line.<br /><br />Sarah eventually learned to let herself go and be brave and went on as many dates as she could. She soon realized that Bob was just taking an advantage of her sexually and didn't take her seriously like Jake did, but she had turned Jake away when he saw her with Bob. Can \\"Dog Park Girl\\" find her way back into the arms of \\"Condom Man\\" before he loses his good intension and go for other girls?<br /><br />Overall, this film is pretty funny and so-so romantic ,and it's got lots of chick-flick cliche jokes that will work for the female crowds. Diane Lane fans will love this film, because she's very charming and still beautiful for her age. It's rare to see Hollywood let an actress over 40 to carry a romantic comedy these days.sly like Jake did, but she had turned Jake away when he saw her with Bob.

B000056NX5|3.0|Jesus Christ Superstar, in any incarnation, will always be about the sound - music and vocals. This DVD, though full of energy, falls really short.<br />If you've seen the 1973 movie Jesus Christ Superstar or heard the original concept album, you'll invariably judge this newer stage video production against the benchmarks set earlier.<br />For me, the new JCS was interesting at best, terrible at worst.<br />Here are my pros and cons of this DVD which at times I compare against the 73 film which featured Ted Neeley as Christ and Carl Anderson as Judas.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />1. Fred Johanson as Pilate is stunning - more powerful than the original. Great voice, great emotive visual delivery. His performance is the only plus of this production over the previous.<br />2. Caiaphas and Annas both deliver powerfully.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Too theatrical, even though meant to be so. Too many dramatic facial expressions and excess body language (Jesus, Mary, et al) detract from the purity of the score and lyrics.<br />2. Even though Jesus, Judas, and Mary have good voices, they do not match the raw beauty of the original 73 movie, or of the older Ian Gillan (as Christ) concept cast audio recording. Despite some reviews written here, Judas from the originals - Carl Anderson and Murray Head - are incomparable, as is Mary.<br />3. While Glenn Carter here as Jesus is perhaps a little more voluminous in voice than Neeley of 73, he lacks the piercing simplicity of the latter. Neeley's \\"Gethsemene\\" was phenomenal, as was Ian Gillan's (even more so) in the concept album. Carter murders this singularly outstanding number with his flat, choir-boy, shriekish delivery.<br />4. Simon is weak...his delivery never reaches the power of his 73 predecessor.<br />5. Herod delivers a terribly choppy number sans harmony. Herod, though a freak characterization in the original, was a musical hit with his lilting, jazz-rockish mockery of the Star.<br />6. Even though the musical score does give you goose bumps at times, it does not match the originals; and, the surging vocal insets within numbers you aurally seek just don't happen nearly enough.<br /><br />Suggestion: If you're torn between which JCS dvd to buy, get the 1973 movie. This stage production video lacks the hippie-rock grandeur, authenticity, and vocal masterpieces of the original. If a few bucks don't matter really, go ahead and get this production as well...otherwise save your money. This dvd will not receive your collector's pride as the original does, but art is art and thanks to artists, JCS continues to be performed. I bet seen live, this performance may redeem itself somewhat.<br />P.S. Try and get the audio CD of the pre-1973-movie concept album of JCS sometime, featuring Ian Gillan (Deep Purple vocalist, and a phenomenal high notes screamer), Murray Head, and others, for a taste of the true original sound of this classic. That CD and the 1973 film are masterpieces.give you goose bumps at times, it does not match the originals; and, the surging vocal insets within numbers you aurally seek just don't happen nearly enough.<br /><br />Suggestion: If you're torn between which JCS dvd to buy, get the 1973 movie.

B00005JMJ4|4.0|In case the title confuses some, I think this is one of the 10 best movies of 2003.  However, I really have no idea who this movie is trying to reach out to, and I also don't know anybody who might like this film.  I love it, but I guess the only way to keep this review fresh is to acknowledge and criticze the common remarks.  Here are my two cents.    \\"This movie isn't about anything\\"  ---Very true, but it's not trying to be.  I know that's not a very appealing aspect, but for me that helps the movie.  I believe that life has a purpose, but I also admit that life is not spelled out like it is in epics or Shakespeare...or 99% of the movies I've ever seen.    \\"This movie isn't funny.\\"  ---This movie isn't very funny.  That, sadly, is one of its faults.  I'm all for dry humor, but Bob Harris (played wonderfully by Bill Murray) is trying to limit his reputation as an actor, keeping things on the down-low.  Well, writer-director Sofia Coppola should've rethought that approach, because you can't aim for something with your characters and then expect the audience to react the exact opposite.  In other words, you can't make Bill Murray funny by making him desperately trying to be unfunny.  Nevertheless, I smiled and nodded at the movie's undeniable charm.    \\"Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson give the best performances of their career.\\"  ---Johansson was equally good in \\"Girl With A Pearl Earring,\\" but she's perfect here.  She's young, but intelligent.  She's lonely, but makes efforts to cope with that.  She's confused, but she learns that there's plenty of time left in her life.  As far as Murray goes, I prefer his comedic turns in \\"Rushmore\\" and \\"Groundhog Day,\\" but I will say that he perfectly captures the character of Bob Harris, and acheives what he tries to accomplish with this role.  Roger Ebert said it best \\"Bill Murray is becoming the master of minimalist expressions.\\"    \\"Sofia Coppola makes up for the bad acting in 'The Godfather: Part III'.\\"  ---I, for one, thought she was \\"OKAY\\" in that movie, but who cares?  She's behind the camera, and to me, she would've been my pick for the Best Director Of The Year (Oscars chose Peter Jackson...excellent alternative).  She did not go for an epic or grandiose feel.  She acheived what very movies do for me...I felt like I was actually there in the world of the characters.  I felt what Charlotte and Bob felt...which is a good thing and a bad thing.  When they were having fun, so was I.  When they were bored, Coppola captured that a little too well in a couple of scenes.  When Bob and Charlotte don't want to leave each, I didn't want the movie to end.    \\"I'm glad that Bob and Charlotte don't have a passionate relationship, but an actual bond.\\"  ---I don't know who said it first or best, but I am in total agreement.  The last thing this movie needed was a sex scene.    \\"The supporting characters are either underused, or unnecessary.\\"  ---This is one of those points where I understand the intention (they're supposed to be quirky and add flavor to the oddities of the Japanese culture), but again, it works too well.  To develop them would've hurt the movie, but the way they are isn't completely satisfactory.  This is a lesser-of-two-evils debate.    \\"This movie is boring.\\"  ---I guess since a lot people have made this comment, I suppose my disagreement won't change their minds.  \\"Lost In Translation\\" is admittedly slow, but that's because the movie focuses on the week that Bob and Charlotte share with each other.  Sofia Coppola is patient with their scenes together - I can't back this up, but I think a lot of people are simply impatient viewers.    \\"This movie was way too over-praised.\\"  ---I don't believe \\"Lost In Translation\\" is a masterpiece, but it is an excellent movie.  Even if this film isn't entertaining to everybody (nobody I know likes this movie!), can anyone deny that this movie is something unique?  Can't even the un-impressed audiences admit that Sofia Coppola tried to go for an emotional response that few filmmakers have attempted?  One thing I believe that nobody can deny about \\"Lost In Translation\\" is this: There has never been a more honest or believable film ever.  Because there is no conventional plot structure or character development, but instead pure experience and emotion...you will never see a more genuine motion picture.    I wish I could recommend this movie to people, and it saddens me that most don't enjoy it.  However, this movie gave me such a strong reaction, that I had to put it in words.    I love this movie, but it's an excellent film that somehow is \\"Not Recommended.\\"  Definitely check it out BEFORE you buy it!
B00005JMJG|5.0|We all know how the saying goes: \\"It is better to have loved and lost than to not have loved at all.\\" Just because something doesn't work out doesn't mean that it was a waste of time. It you're very lucky, you can learn from your mistakes. Everybody needs their memories, both good and bad-especially bad, to learn from them and not repeat them. <br /> <br />That is the basic point of 'Eternal Sunshine.' As the film opens, Joel (played to perfection by Jim Carrey) impulsivly skips work to go to Montauk. There he meets Clementine (the lovely and amazing Kate Winslet), a woman so different from him she might just be perfect for him. They have an instant bond and everything seems fine for these perfect strangers.  <br /> <br />However, as the film continues, we find out, in a bout of dramatic irony, that Joel and Clem aren't strangers-they are past lovers who have no memory of each other. At the end of their crumbling relationship, Clem impulsivly had her memory of Joel ereased. Heartbroken and angry, Joel went to have the same procedure, founded by Howard Meirzwiak (Tom Wilkinson) and performed by technicians including Stan (Mark Ruffalo), Patrick (Elijah Wood, retiring gracefully from 'Lord of the Rings') and Mary (Kirsten Dunst). Most of the film takes place in Joel's head as he is having the procedure. He relives/remembers his memories with Clem, working backwards from the crumbling end. However, as time goes by (or backwards), he realizes that there were some really beautiful memories of them, and that they were in love. So he tries to \\"hide\\" her in memories where she doesn't belong, much to the frustration of the technicians doing the procedure. The film also cuts to the three technicians doing the procedure at Joel's house while he is asleep. We find out that Patrick is now dating Clem by using Joel's lines, and that Mary and Stan are lovers but she is in love with Howard, but she has no idea of her own past. In fact, it is Mary, not Joel or Clem, who makes a 180and realizes the power of memory and tries to undo her, and others', mistakes. <br /> <br />I have no idea where to begin. This film was by far the best film of 2004. French music video director Michel Gondry uses his visual knowledge and wisdom to create a beautiful, wonderful and crazy atmosphere, using little to no special affects, just camera moves and choreography, to make wonders. Also, the freedom that he gives to his actors to improvise enhances all of their performances. If you aren't already familiar with composer Jon Brion's work (Magnolia, I Heart Huckabee's), I can assure you that you will now-his dreamy atmospheric music totally enhances the scenes in every way. Charlie Kaufman, the brilliant and manic mind behind the Oscar nominated films 'Being John Malkovich' and 'Adaptation' finally won his first Oscar for his crazy and beautiful script.  <br /> <br />And then there's the acting. I am in total awe of Kate Winslet and Jim Carrey. You have never seen them in roles like these before. At first I was knocked out of my chair, waiting for them to suddenly become \\"themselves\\", but they never got out of character ONCE. Actually, their roles are switched-it is Jim Carrey playing the introverted and shy character and Kate Winslet playing the spontaneous and free character. On the outside they look like water and oil, but underneath the skin they are the same blue ruins.  <br /> <br />As tough as the male competition was for Best Actor, I still argue and am shocked that Jim Carrey didn't get nominated for his role. He was totally inside Joel's head the entire time and you truly believed Jim's performance. Actually, it wasn't even a performance-he WAS Joel. And Kate Winslet proves that she is one of the greatest living actresses today. She keeps Clem exciting and witty, but also allowing us to see Clem's vulnerable side. As good as Hilary Swank was in Million Dollar Baby, I just really wanted to see Kate take home her first Oscar, in the most exciting performance of 2004. Jim and Kate have the best chemistry in a long draught of awful \\"romances\\" over the years-different as they are, they complete each other and you really believe why they are both in love and love each other. Together they were, well, spotless. <br /> <br />I can say without being over-entheusiastic that 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' is easily one of the best films ever made. It is wildly romantic, undeniably original, incredibly poignant, and surprisingly real. Mark my words: You will never forget 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.'
B0009HLDFU|1.0|Another case where the music industry has just done it's best to make life harder on law abiding citizens while having no affect on the real criminals. You can currently get this album from many illigal music sites and they are immediately I-POD compatible.
B0006L16N8|5.0|...And Coldplay does rock, maybe not as hard as your Hillary Duff cd. With out a doubt this one of the best albums of the 21st Century so far.
B0006399FS|1.0|I'd suggest you buy any U2 album from War to Pop (excluding Hattle & Hum) instead of this sad excuse for an album & anything U2 have done since 1997!!!! <br /> <br />God...what happened?????
0333710932|5.0|A very enjoyable book that's very well written with excellent illustration.  My daughter has had it for a year and a half (since she was 2.5) and she still loves it, as the humour is layered at different levels.  I also highly recommend its sequel \\"The Gruffalo's Child\\", which is equally excellent.
B0009HLDFU|1.0|I had planned on buying this, I was looking forward to the new album for a while now.  Luckily I read the reviews here.  I will not now or ever buy a CD that limits my playing capabilities.  If that means that I limit my new music purchases, so be it.  There's a lot more out there.  Thanks RCA for saving me $17.
B0006L16N8|1.0|Don't buy this album. Borrow it from one of your trusty friends (some fool's bound to own it). If you don't have friends, listening to Coldplay, or rather, SIGNING UP to join the Coldplay Army might very well give you the opportunity to make friends (although I wouldn't recommend this).<br /><br />I recommend RECYCLING, infact I encourage people to recycle their WASTE products. However an ARTIST / MUSICIAN should never RECYCLE their material. Chris Martin and Coldplay can't seem comprehend this simple matter. The DIEHARD Coldplay fans can't seem to understand or accept this simple matter.<br /><br />Musically speaking this album is RECYCLED. Coldplay have always had a nack for ETERNALLY LOOPING a banal melody line in each of their songs. The compositions in the X&Y album are no different.<br />They've taken their OLD material out of the GARBAGE can and mixed it up again. If youre the kind of person who looks for PROGRESSION / DEVELOPMENT / MATURITY in music, you definately be disappointed. Experimentation and dynamics are lacking in the X&Y.<br /><br />The Degeneration of Coldplay<br /><br />PARACHUTES - original, good solid album.<br />RUSH OF BLOOD TO THE HEAD - 50% recycled, old similar sound, weak<br />X&Y - 100% recycled, repetitive, overrated & unoriginal.<br /><br />so SAVE your money. BORROW it, DOWNLOAD it, get it any way you can. DO NOT BUY IT. Its not worth it.
0895260131|5.0|We're living in the era that should be called the Golden Age of Guilt.  Many in our media is trying to convince us that Americans need to atone for our past transgressions and that terrorism is merely the result of hundreds of years of colonial oppression by the English and Americans.  Terrorists have now been sucessfully morphed into \\"freedom fighters\\" and on 9/11, many in the left fully believe we got what was coming to us.<br /><br />This is why this book by Robert Spencer is such a great read as he doesn't just lift the veil on this nonsense but rips it off and burns it.  Spencer's book is slap in the face at those that perpetuate this self-loathing attitude and want to revise history with America as the chief bad guy.  Even the communists are getting a free pass by these new age revisionists. He points out that the Jihad that has been called against us today is every bit a threat as the one Europe faced against the Muslim hordes centuries ago.  It's not meant to scare or frighten.  It's meant to slap us out of the comotose funk we've been in.<br /><br />Spencer will provide a look at the real Prophet Muhammad and show how cruel, blood-thirsty, and illicit he was.  Then there's the Koran with it's hate-filled teachings of anything non-muslim, it's treatment of women, and the opression of progress and why so many of these \\"freedom fighters\\" fear true democracy.  A marvelous book that must be read.
B00003CXCT|4.0|Darth Vader's armour never looked sharper. Didn't particularly like Hayden's cameo at the end of Return of the Jedi. A good set to complete the saga after my kids had watched Episode III.
B0002Z0EYK|3.0|This movie really has one major flaw...which would be prettified blonde Gap ad Brad Pitt. I've liked him in other movies in the past but here he just seems lost in his character and overwhemed by the stories scope. Eric Bana makes this movie watchable, I feel bad for him for ending up in flops like this and The Hulk because he is actually a decent actor. Orlando Bloom whines like a 3 year old girl the entire film and proves he has little resonace onscreen when he actually has to speak. The cinemotography is excellent and the rest of the supporting cast is good, but there still isn't anything too memorable going on here, this movie could have been a whole lot better, but it could also have been worse.
0393317552|5.0|Not a page turner, but one of the most compelling books you'll ever read.  It's worth the work.  If you think you understand the world but have not read this book, you may well have overestimated your grasp of human society.  This book is well-argued and brilliant.
B0009A40ES|5.0|Christian Bale turns in a great performance in this disturbing yet darkly comic tale of an 80's yuppie with a bloodlust as strong as his self obsession. The movie serves as a time capsule to the 80's and the materialism that consumed American culture at the time. There are scenes in this movie that made me laugh my a## off. For lovers of dark humor and social commentary. Highly recommed for sensible viewers.
B0009RCPY8|4.0|Just a bit of information I know I would have like to have had before I bought it: There are some reviews on this page complaining that the first film is presented only in fullscreen.. The slip-cover for the set does, in fact, list the first film as being in fullscreen, and the second as being in 2.40:1 widescreen.. which confused me and I bought it anyway figuring that there was no reason they would do one film properly but not the other. Then I noticed that on the slip-cover under special features they list the FIRST film as being in widescreen, but NOT the second... It gets stranger. When you open it and look at the individual cases, the first film is labeled as being in 2.40:1 widescreen, and the second is listed as being in 2.35:1 (NOT 2.40)...    Well, dyslexic cover-art designers aside, when you watch the films they ARE BOTH IN WIDESCREEN.. whether one is 2.40 and one is 2.35 I didn't really bother to figure out, and frankly I doubt given the attention to detail displayed on the boxes. Either way, the films do look really good.    The special features are, like most people said, nothing to scream about and mainly re-packaged from the earlier releases with the notable exception of episodes from the cartoon, which are pretty awful. The scrapbook is nice, despite having an odd odor like burnt french fries...    As for the films themselves, I haven't really watched them since I was about 12, and so it was pure nostalgia. They were actually better than I expected. The first one is plainly the \\"better\\" movie, and the second one basically shamelessly recreates its plot blow by blow (Instead of stay puft, we have the statue of liberty, instead of an evil apartment building, we have an evil museum, instead of arguments with a surprisingly accommodating mayor and his meddlesome underlings, we have... arguments with a surprisingly accommodating mayor and his meddlesome underlings.) However, in some strange way, the second film feels fresher to me, and the real joy of the movies was watching these great actors do their thing, and they're all just as good the second time around. Even if Winston still has nothing to do besides show up once in a while to deflect criticism about an all-white cast.    So, anyway, hoped that cleared up some stuff.
B0000640SB|5.0|I would actually rate this movie 4and a half stars. This movie is a lot of fun, energetic, exhibits a spot on sense of humor, ecspecially Tommy Lee Jones excellent dead pan, and is filled with great special effects and an actual honest to god storyline. Highly recommended but avoid the train wreck of a sequel.
B00008OWZC|5.0|I am going to keep this short.  I would like to saw that the raw power present in this album is amazing.  One reviewer said that Zeppelin does not improve their songs, that is not true.  The songs on this cd have evolved and become more complex musical numbers.  This cd would be worth the money even if it was just the amazing version of the \\"Immigrant Song\\".  The songs are so amazing that I have trouble listening to the studio version and not getting annoyed.  This cd is up there with The Who's \\"Live at Leeds.\\"  If you want pure hard rock, look no further than \\"How The West Was Won.\\"
B00003CWNR|5.0|I love this movie, Michael Caine is superb and Tobey Maguire really shines. This movie boasts a great story and involving characters you actually care about. This movies weakest link was Charlize Theron, who despite being very attractive just never seems to wow me in movies, including this one, but hell she's not nearly as bad a J.Lo so oh well.
B00005NB0H|5.0|This is The Who at their best.  True, this is before \\"Who's Next\\" and \\"Quadrophenia\\" but that does not subtract from the near perfection of this music.  The first disc is amazingly mastered and  \\"tinny\\" but it is bearably as the music is still amazing.  The only complaint I have is the HORRIBLE feedback in parts of both \\"Acid Queen\\" and \\"Pinball Wizard.\\"  This cd is a must have.  Buy the deluxe edition, I would hate losing the 20 songs from \\"Tommy.\\"
B00080ZG10|3.0|I used to like Leonardo Dicaprio. In movies like Basketball Diaries, What's Eating Gilbert Grape, and even Titanic, but he's really become very dull to me, and this film is very spotty and inconsistant. Dicaprio wasn't awful in this movie he just wasn't great by any means, and this movie is watchable but nothing more really. Dicaprio and Scorsese's last pairing Gangs of New York was a disaster so this one seems excellent by comparison. If Dicaprio and Scosese want Oscars then they really need better material than what they've had lately. I'm hoping they both have a return to form.
B00005RG6M|5.0|In my humble opinion, this classic Queen album already was (one of) the best albums in the entire history of pop-music, but if you her this audio-DVD, there is definitely an ultimate dimension added, which is even far beyond the quality of the original. You just gotta hear this one!!!
B0002KVUKM|1.0|This movie is the very definition of style over substance. In fact there ultimatly is no substance whatsoever that I could find. A dull parade of special effects wrapped around over acting and pure juvenile silliness. Hugh Jackman is great in the X-Men movies but he should have left this script out on the back porch and let the sun eat away at the pages, come to think of it that would probably have made a better movie than Van Helsing turned out to be.
B0009KA7BS|3.0|I missed \\"Constantine\\" in theaters and thus looked forward to discovering for the first time via home viewing a quality motion picture adaptation of a popular comic book character.  And, in the end, I did enjoy the film.  Just be warned that it isn't like the \\"Spider-Man\\" movies.  Unlike those earlier films, \\"Constantine\\" is more interesting and intellectually stimulating than exciting.<br /><br />In particular, I enjoyed the film's somewhat subversive vision that the goals and objectives emanating from Heaven and Hell are sometimes laced with the same base political motivations that are often the springboards for the official positions held by powerful organizations here on Earth.  I liked how the bad guys could be charming and somewhat sympathetic despite their Hellish origins, and how the holy characters (I'm mostly thinking of Tilda Swinton's Angel Gabriel character here) can come up with questionable and truly bizarre plans to rid the Earth of evil, even if it means something close to apocalypse has to result in the meantime.<br /><br />The film skillfully mixes several genres and flavors (horror movie, detective thriller, and romance story among them), which successfully results in an entertaining whole.  It's just not a wildly entertaining whole, and you'll probably have more fun disecting the movie with a friend afterward over a beer than you did when you were watching it.<br /><br />I bought the two-disc special edition, and the extras on the second disc are very well done.  In fact, if you don't know much about the Constantine character beforehand it's perfectly safe to watch the first couple of featurettes on the second disc before you watch the movie; they discuss the comic book origins of the character and the goals the film makers had in adapting the character to the screen.  These featurettes don't give away any major plot points and may make it easier to appreciate the film a little more when you watch it.  As a John Constantine novice I wished that I had watched those extra features first; I would have gotten more out of my first viewing of the movie.<br /><br />Still, I enjoyed \\"Constantine\\".  After all, one has to have a soft spot for a movie that suggests that even death isn't an escape from the mundane bureaucracies of daily life, that one just trades dull rules and regulations administered by earthbound bureaucrats with mundane rules and regulations administered by angels and demons.  That whole riff was pretty funny, actually.wished that I had watched those extra features first; I would have gotten more out of my first viewing of the movie. <br /> <br />Still, I enjoyed \\"Constantine\\".

B0009KA7BS|3.0|This movie is better than some of the other recent comic book adaptations that bog down our theaters anymore. This is definatly not as crappy as say, Catwoman, Elektra, the lackluster HellBoy, League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, The Hulk, Daredevil, Spawn, and is also better than the two Matrix sequels. That being said that really doesn't mean much though because that is a pretty crappy list. Keanu Reeves does well as the title character and the supporting cast is really good as well, but this film is strictly for genre fans. Some good effects make up for the silly theological mish mash.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|A great film to compare this one against is Todd Solondz's masterful \\"Welcome to the Dollhouse.\\"  Both are centered around a character conventionally described as a \\"nerd,\\" \\"geek,\\" \\"dork,\\" etc.---adolescent pariahs.  Solondz's however is a far darker vision: he treats all of his characters mercilessly, his knife cuts in all directions and the audience is left squirming and cringing the whole way through.  Hess's film while also reveling in long drawn-out awkward moments, is far more forgiving---in fact, if anything it can be faulted for sugarcoating and copping out with the humorous but implausible happy ending.  Yes there is some amount of self-consicously hip dork-worship but he doesn't overdo it, in contrast to films like \\"Rushmore.\\"<br /><br />Hess treats every one of his characters gently, even as he teases them and exposes all of their flaws.  We do squirm, but not to the extent that we have to look away from the screen like with a Todd Solondz movie---there is no element of sadism present.  So the gentleness extends to the viewer too.  The whole film is full of implausible and absurd situations, but does it so consistently that it actually becomes almost believable by the end---reminds me a little of the Coen brothers' early work.<br /><br />I wouldn't buy it, but it was an enjoyable and light 86 minutes courtesy of netflix.com
B000060K4O|5.0|This film has held up for over twenty years and it is still every bit as good as it was in 1984. Bill Murray was in perfect form in one of his greatest performances ever, and the rest of the cast follows the lead and hand in equally good turns in this hilarious fantasy adventure. If you've never seen this you've missed one of the greatest and most enjoyable times at the movies you could ever hope to have, and if you are like me and have loved this movie since it came out, here's to hoping this film continues to inspire the new crop of filmakers into other great films such as the obviously inspired by Ghostbusters Men in Black. A perfect score for this movie no question.
B000059GHR|5.0|This is an outstanding compilation of The Beatles' number one hits. While it does not necessarily encompass their best music, just the most popular, it is still a breath taking body of music. This CD takes the listener through The Beatles' early years right through to the end of their musical association. The evolvement of their music is clearly evident on this CD, as one takes this virtual musical stroll down memory lane. It is wonderful to hear their maturation from young, wide-eyed pop stars to more complex and sophisticated musicians.<br /><br />For new listeners, this generous, value laden, twenty seven track CD serves as an introduction to the Fab Four who changed the landscape of the musical world in the early nineteen sixties. For those of us who grew up with The Beatles, it is a blast from the past. Moreover, the production values on this CD are superlative. Quite frankly, the music did not sound this good when it was first recorded, due to technological limitations. All audiophiles will appreciate the beautiful clarity of sound on this CD which makes the music soar to new heights.
B00005JL7Q|5.0|I had never been much of a Hugh Grant fan until watching this movie. His comic talents are on full display here. Hugh Grant has a knack for playing self centered pricks or bumbling fools. In this he is doing the self centered thing. This movie is hilarious and heartfelt. Nick Hornsby seems to translate well to the big screen, High Fidelity was just as good as this. This film shines as a story of love, transformation, and redemption, as well as a offering a lot of laughs along the way.
B0000DEPXB|4.0|The Beatles continue on their voyage of musical self-discovery which they began in earnest with their release of \\"Rubber Soul\\", which I consider to be a better collection than this one. Eleven of the fourteen tracks on \\"Revolver\\" were written by the prolific Lennon/McCartney duo, while George Harrison penned the remaining three.<br /><br />The CD begins with a rousing bit of wit penned by Harrison, \\"The Tax Man\\", which I consider to be one of Harrison's best efforts. This is followed the mysterious and melodic \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" which is a terrific song, moody and provocative. The beautifully harmonized love song, \\"Here, There, and Everywhere', is followed by the strange, though imaginative, \\"Yellow Submarine\\". They also introduce a number redolent of a British music hall, \\"Good Day Sunshine\\". The track on this CD probably most reminiscent of their earlier efforts is \\"Got To Get You Into My Life\\".<br /><br />This eclectic collection of songs shows that The Beatles were on mission to extend their range, a road that they were able to travel because of their versatility. While this is a very good album, it is still too self-conscious and disjointed an effort. The best of The Beatles is yet to come.
B000059Z8J|5.0|This movie is the original, and although not the best, it is very much still the comic book super hero film to measure all others that have come since. This movie deserves recognition for the daring to attempt a comic to screen adaptation in the first place and to make a man believably seem to fly. The catchphrase in fact took great pride in the fact that the filmmakers were certain that the audience would be convinced a man could fly. Christopher Reeve, an unknown at the time stepped in the red cape and would forever embody Superman for the generations that would watch this film. Gene Hackman is dead on as Lex Luther and Ned Beatty as his cohort is hilarious. Marlon Brando's brief and multi million dollar appearance does exactly what the producers had hoped and gave this film a very rich, real and strong resonace with the viewer. The story is heartfelt and genuine, the action segments are realistic and exciting. This film defined the very reasons we go to the movies. To this very day i still truly believe that a man can fly.
B00005GL0V|4.0|\\"Let It Be\\", recorded before \\"Abbey Road'' but released last, has been pilloried by critics. While it lacks the finesse of George Martin's magic, it is still a very good album. It has two of Paul McCartney's best vocal efforts on it, in the title song, \\"Let It Be\\", which is beautiful and moving, as well as in the poignant \\"The Long And Winding Road\\". Paul's vocals are also notable in the rocking \\"Get Back\\" track.<br /><br />This album comes closest to making The Beatles sound as they did when they first began recording. This is probably because they performed live for many of the tracks, which gave them the projected warmth of their earlier efforts. While Phil Spector was the producer who cobbled together this recording, he was heavily criticized for his handling of the material. Paul himself chastised him for the arrangement of \\"The Long and Winding Road\\". With The Beatles at odds amongst themselves, however, it was a miracle this recording was put to bed in the first place. Old time fans of The Beatles are thankful that Phil was able to put this last release together. Notwithstanding all the brouhaha, it is still a CD well worth having.
B00005JLKN|4.0|Better then the previous prequel 'Manhuter'.  ToothFairy is a lot more sinister in this version (thanks to the extraordinary Ralph Fiennes, can't wait to see him as Voldmort).  Anthony Hopkins could play Hannibal Lector in his sleep.  Strong performance by both Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Emily Watson.  Thought Edward Norton gave a very lack luster performance, nothing like his in American History X or Primal Fear, so he was the weak link.  Very erie feel to the movie. Has one or two rough spots but all in all I would diffently recommend this movie.
B00000DMJF|4.0|This is an eclectic and interesting two disc CD by The Beatles. It runs the gamut of musical genres: rock, blues, pop, and country/folk. It is wildly divergent in style from their previous release, \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\", as it is certainly less experimental.<br /><br />It has some great rock based tunes, such as \\"Back in the U.S.S.R.\\", which seems to be a parody of the Beach Boys' sound. It contains a good blues based number, \\"Why Don't We Do It In The Road\\". It also has some interesting country/folk inspired songs, such as \\"Rocky Raccoon\\", and \\"The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill\\". They also included a song with a British Music Hall feel to it, \\"Honey Pie\\", which leaves me cold. Of course, the requisite upbeat pop song is covered by \\"Ob-La-Di, Ob La Da\\", which I love for its uplifting beat. If you want a pop ballad, you need only to listen to \\"Blackbird\\". This CD has something for everyone.
0790729628|5.0|This is my favorite movie ever made. The story is of such depth and thought that it is very hard not to be drawn into this film. The visual effects broke new ground for futuristic films, name a sci-fi film since that hasn't borrowed from Blade Runner in story, appearance and style. Harrison Ford delivers a nuanced and restrained performance and is fully believable. The questions this film raises are the questions that have been asked since the dawn of time and they are handled with much respect and consideration here, far better than any film since, what makes us human? What is the essence of life and what is it's purpose? This film is visually astounding and thought provoking. Every performance in this film is perfect. The ending is mind blowing when Ford's character faces down the films central villian, an android who dreams of being human. Films rarely reach this level of greatness, but when they do it is the cinematic equivalent puppy love, it may not last long but you'll always remember it.
B0000DEPRI|5.0|The psychedelic epiphany in which The Beatles indulged brought forth some of their best and most innovative efforts. While only six of the tracks were written for The Beatles' television film, \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\", and the other five tracks, comprised of their singles' releases for 1967, were later added for purposes of an album release, it all works. In fact, two of the songs, \\"Penny Lane\\" and \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\", originally were written for their \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" album but were ultimately dropped, as they did not fit the creative concept upon which they were working at the time. It is almost hard to believe that these two great songs were originally each a side of the same single release.<br /><br />There are, however, a lot of other great songs on this CD. Each and every one of them stands alone on its own merits. While \\"Penny Lane\\", a richly evocative, nostagic refrain, is my own personal favorite, there is a variety from which to choose. From the haunting \\"The Fool On The Hill\\" to the psychedelic drug infused \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" to the rocking rythyms of \\"Baby You're A Rich Man\\", there is a song for everyone. This a CD no avid music collector should be without. For those who love The Beatles, this CD will serve to remind them as to why they love them.
B0007Y08QA|5.0|I have become very impressed with Christian of late. I recently went to see Batman Begins, in which Bale helped revive and refresh the dead franchise and I also bought the new Special Edition of American Psycho where Bale delivered a jaw dropping tour de force of a performance in a film few had the balls to even touch. The Machinist received a lot of press for Bale's dramatic weight loss and indeed the first glimpse of the emaciated actor demands a double take, you really just wish this guy would eat a ham sandwich. The movie is a suspenseful psychological drama with some vibrant touches of horror and is directed and acted beautifully. One of the best and original films of the years. I also thouroughly enjoyed director Brad Anderson's previous film Session 9, I cannot wait to see what he does next, the same goes for Bale.
B0000DEPDZ|4.0|\\"Abbey Road\\" was the last album The Beatles recorded as a group, though the \\"Let It Be\\" album was the last recording they released. This was certainly the end of an era, and none of The Beatles would go on to match the success that they had enjoyed collectively as one of the most imaginative, talented, and successful groups ever to grace the music industry.<br /><br />\\"Abbey Road\\" is an excellent recording. Interestingly enough, one of the best tracks on the album, and certainly his best effort, is George Harrison's \\"Something\\". This album has many good songs from which the listener may choose, however. and the tracks on it are as diverse in feeling as The Beatles themselves. The reality is that this album remains best known for the fact that this would be the last recording by The Beatles. As such, no music collection should be without it.
B00003CX9S|5.0|A touching movie about the horribly disfigured John Merrick. Hurt and Hopkins performances are very strong and the story is written and filmed very well. This is director David Lynch's most accessible film but that certainly does not weaken it in any respect. A movie of true heart and a celebration of being human, with all it's flaws and imperfections intact.
B0000DEPRW|5.0|This fabulous, fourteen track CD, with twelve tracks by the Lennon/McCartney songwriting duo, one track by Lennon/McCartney/Starkey (Ringo), and one by George Harrison, is a significant departure from their earlier works. Here, the music is lusher, darker, and more complex. With the release of this album, The Beatles bid goodbye to their \\"Yeah, Yeah, Yeah\\" days and established themselves as a musical force of note, more talented than anyone had imagined.<br /><br />With vivid imagery and themes, they sang about life and all its turbulent emotions, a virtual social commentary. From the rock and roll refrains of \\"Drive My Car\\" to the sitar laden \\"Norwegian Wood\\", followed up by the existential \\"Nowhere Man\\", The Beatles had a lot to say, and they did so with a vengeance.<br /><br />Love was still an important theme, however, to which Paul paid homage with the romantic ballad, \\"Michelle\\", as did John in \\"Girl\\", a song so filled with yearning it is almost palpable. As if this weren't enough, add the lament of love lost in \\"I'm Looking Through You\\", as well as the achingly poignant \\"In My Life\\", and you have a musical experience so complete, that no music collector should be without this CD.
0767834739|5.0|If you are into sci-fi/horror/action flicks like the Alien movies, you'll dig this one a lot.  Milla Jovovich is hot and tough, and there's another beautiful girl as well as a funny sidekick dude for comic relief.  The DVD is terrific, with lots of extra scenes, documentaries, & commentaries.  Definitely one to watch with the lights out & the volume up.
B00002781F|5.0|Having had the record album many years ago, I was happy to get the CD. It is a wonderful CD by a prolific and talented songwriter who just happens to be a most expressive singer. Who better to sing her songs.<br /><br />Without a doubt, the best track on the CD is \\"Will You Love Me Tomorrow\\". Not only is the music terrific and the singing expressive, the lyrics to this song are pure poetry. \\"It's Too Late\\", \\"You've Got a Friend\\", and \\"Tapestry\\" are some of the other golden tracks on this CD.<br /><br />There is not, however, one bad track on this CD, and there are not too many CDs about which one may say this. The CD liner also includes the lyrics to the songs on it. It is definitely a CD without which no music library should be.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|I ordered this uncensored version of \\"Team America World Police\\" for my boyfriend, and it is hilarious!  If you like South Park, you'll love this feature length parody by Matt Stone and Trey Parker.  The language and subject matter are quite colorful, so I would not want my kids in the room while \\"Team America\\" is on...adult audience only!
B00005JNSK|5.0|Many people are really going to dislike this movie.  Many of them before they ever see the movie.  \\"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\\" is such a beloved classic and many people never wanted to see the movie re-made.  But theres something that you have to take into account.  Tim Burton and Johnny Depp.  Those two have collaborated four times and the three previous would spectacular, so you would have to believe that this movie would be great.  And staying true to their form, the movie is great.<br /><br />The story is the same as the previous film.  The owner of the greatest chocolate factory in the world, Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp), decides to let five children and a guardian of each to take a tour of his factory that has been closed to the public and to everyone for years.  They can take the tour if they find one of five golden tickets inside of the Wonka Bars.  Also one lucky kid will win a special prize.  So obviously, people go nuts trying to find these golden tickets by buying just about every Wonka Bar in sight.  Four of the golden tickets are found by fairly wealthy, spoiled kids and then the last one is found by sweet, very poor Charlie Buckett.  The kids are given a tour of the chocolate factory by Willy Wonka himself.  While in the factory, kids that are greedy, fat, cocky and too smart start disappearing out of the factory due to their behavior.  Kind of like what happens in Se7en.  The last kid left with Willy Wonka is Charlie and he wins the grand prize, The Chocolate Factory.  Did I really need to write all of that?<br /><br />First thing that people will judge is Johnny Depp's Willy Wonka compared to Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka.  The thing that you will have to understand is that they are portraying two different Willy Wonka's.  Wilder's was sweet, charming and caring of the children.  Depp's is very cocky, paranoid and socially inept.  So to judge one character to another is like comparing apples and oranges.  My opinion is that Johnny Depp does a fantastic job with the character.  I like the darker Willy Wonka that he plays and honestly, who could play this character better than Johnny Depp?  Also who could direct this film better than Tim Burton.  One of the songs from the original has a line that says \\"in a world of pure imagination.\\"  Is there any director with a greater imagination than Burton?  The colors, the odd shapes, the acting, along with Danny Elfman's creepy score all screams Tim Burton's classic film style.  The rest of the cast does a good job, but this movie is the Willy Wonka Show.<br /><br />So would I recommend this movie?  Definitely!  Is it better than the original?  I liked this movies darker setting, but it just matters on what your movie taste is.  So I would say that if you don't like Tim Burton movies, then don't see this movie.  If you like Tim Burton's style, then this is the film for you.
B000002U9W|4.0|Atom Heart Mother is quite an easily overlooked album. The band themselves are not really fond of it, and none of its songs have really ever seen the light of day on any other compilation. I'll breakdown the tracks from here. <br /> <br />1. Atom Heart Mother (23:31) <br /> <br />This is really a rather intricate work. It features an amazing brass section, and also numerous choral parts. I actually really like the song. Its entirely instrumental, but towards then end you can hear the voice of the producer calling for silence in the studio. <br /> <br />2. If (4:30) <br /> <br />This is Roger Waters' contribution to the work, its a mostly acoustic piece, but it has rather open lyrics. Very apreciable. <br /> <br />3. Summer '68 (5:27) <br /> <br />This is a rare contribution from keyboardist Rick Wright. While he did a good amount of writing, he really doesn't take on lead vocals all that often. The song is rather excellent. <br /> <br />4. Fat Old Sun (5:22) <br /> <br />A contribution from Gilmour. An almost entirely acoustic song, similiar to If. Very good. <br /> <br />5. Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast (12:59) <br /> <br />A piece of pure experimentation. Also entirely instrumental, pretty good track. I really enjoy the piano track. <br /> <br />I would personally reccomend this album to any big pink floyd fan. Its really interesting to look at their early work without Syd Barett. This is really where they began to learn to really write great meaningful music, A great precursor to their later great works. The piece also has merit of its own. While the band hates it, I rather enjoy it. Are the other albums better? Of course Darks Side of the Moon, and The Wall are better works, but  <br />if you put it next to anything it will be better. This work is still quite good. <br /> <br />
B0009RCPX4|5.0|One of the best movies to hit the 80's is now on the up and comming PSP. Who would have thought that ghostbusters would still be so popular 20 years later. Great movie. If you have a PSP its a must buy! Even if you don't have a PSP get the new double set they just released on DVD. It has both movies and some of the cartoons on it as well.
B00006EXL5|5.0|This CD is filled with the singers emotions not to metion it really makes you think about what a love song really is all about. Vampires will never hurt you is a prime example of the different kind of love songs they sing. Though I do love Headfirst for Halos my parents are worried because it is a suicide song, but the way they play it, it is just so damn good. I'd recommend this CD to anyone.
B000059TPN|2.0|Note: 2.5 stars, but the .5 is for the Criterion edition itself, the extras and the mastering.    The Criterion Collection has always put out great movies from great filmmakers; Jean Renoir's The Grand Illusion, Fritz Lang's M, Jules Dassin's Theives' Highway, and now... The Rock?  And on top of that, Michael Bay's The Rock?  Michael Bay for years has epitomized big-budget, badly acted schlock whose only attraction is being loud and full of explosions.  Formula movies at best.  It was fine for what it was, and Sean Connery is always cool, but it totally wasn't Criterion.
B0006A9FKA|1.0|I cant understand why this film is considered by some to be something special. Granted, we all have our opinions, but if a person is interested in good comedy or crafted zombie films I would not suggest this nonsense. With comedy, their is a difference between funny and stupid, the movie is the latter. As a zombie film, their is no real horror felt, just ugly faces and some splattered about fake blood. Horror and comedy can work together, but not in this concoction. The film may have played better in England, but a good British movie works anywhere. Humor can be a matter of taste, I have to concede that. Watch and snore.
B000002H33|1.0|This CD is quite possibly THE most overrated album of all time. There is so many songs on this CD that just drag on for far too long and the song writing isnt strong enough to hold my interest. They try to make each song an epic but they fail terribly to do so in the process. What this band does manage to do though is create very boring generic thrash that just makes you tired. While listening to this CD...maybe they'll have an interesting riff but once that riff emerges...the band beats it into the ground until you're sick of it. Metallica does not feature strong song writers and the only good thing that they managed to do in their career is make thrash popular so more of the music was created (and better at that). Oh, I also can handle long songs because I like Opeth and they create long song structures.
B00005ATQH|5.0|I've seen a lot of movies new and old so don't judge me because I'm 15! I love this film. Kubrick is a fabulous director. The dialogue is beautiful, funny, and quite sexy. Shelley Winters is fabulous...probably the best performance of her career. This is a must OWN!!!
B00005JMAH|3.0|I love the Harry Potter series, books and movie alike - but this third installment of the Harry Potter movie series was very confusing and poorly made - especially if you haven't read the book.   Potter fans should not be angry at this comment, especially as my feelings are that the third BOOK of the series to had the most depth of all six books written thus far. It is simply a shame that the most poignant moments of the book, much of which concerns Harry not only discovering of his own strengths, but of his father's past in a very charming way, are completely left out of the movie.   Instead there is a greater emphasis on special effects - good and bad. The hippogryph was beautifully done, for example, but they could have taken even 2 minutes worth of scenes of showing off special effects to give some explanation to viewers that Harry's patronus was something exceptionally significant to the novel. The viewer is unfortunately given no explanation and simply sits there wondering why the heck there is a bright stag standing there in one of the most dramatic moments of the movie.  Also the explanation of Peter Pettigrew's evil deeds is babbled out so quickly between Sirius and Lupin, it took me three viewings (yes, on DVD) just to figure out what the heck they said.  All in all, I suppose if you really need a visual compliment to the book, its not a complete waste of time, but don't expect to be moved by the movie as you may be by the book. I blame the director and editors. The actors, young, and old are splendid, nothing bad there.
B000002J09|5.0|THIS <br /> <br />THIS IS IT <br /> <br />THE ALBUM OF....EVER <br /> <br />Black Dog: This song has a time-changing riff that could've been found on Presence or Physical Graffiti 10/10 <br /> <br />Rock and Roll: This song has a fast moving riff. Anybody seen the cadillac commercial? Could've been found on Led Zeppelin II or Physical Graffiti 10/10 <br /> <br />The Battle of Evermore: This is a very cool folk song about Lord of the Rings with a small King Arthur reference. Could've been found on Led Zeppelin III 20/10 <br /> <br />Stairway To Heaven: Nothing to say. Could've been found on Houses of the Holy (really the only song like it is The Rain Song) 10000000000000/10 <br /> <br />Misty Mountain Hop: More Lord of the Rings? Me gusta! Sounds very electronic. Could've been on In Through The Out Door. 10/10 <br /> <br />Four Sticks: Very abstract. Couldn't have been on anything else. (MAYBE Houses of the Holy) 10/10 <br /> <br />Going To California: Pretty folk song. I like it as much or better than it's brother on Led Zeppelin III, That's The Way. Oh yeah that's the album it could've been on too. 11/10 <br /> <br />When The Levee Breaks: BLUES. Could've been on Led Zeppelin. MAYBE Led Zeppelin II. 10/10 <br /> <br />One thing undescribable about this on a review is the way it makes you feel. Or more when and where you feel. The mystical-ness of Stairway To Heaven and it's lyrics printed on the sleeve, the hermit by himself on the rock, the faggot binder on the front cover, the namelessness of the album, the mysterious symbols, and the mystic lyrics of the battle of evermore make me feel like I'm in middle-earth in the middle of the night with nothing chasing me, just me, alone, sitting and waiting for morning to come, and thinking about the battle described in the song. I am also being watched by the hermit. <br /> <br />It's truly a rollar coaster ride. From the beginning, Black Dog, I feel like I'm partying before night comes, and Rock and Roll continues that.The Battle of Evermore is the night coming and the scene I just described. Stairway To Heaven is continuing the night with a pursuit building with the song. When you escape at the end you drift into a dream of flowers and hippys that can only be described as Misty Mountain Hop. During the song you wake up and the morning has come and you start towards the Misty Mountains (we're in Middle-Earth remember?). Then you encounter trolls with big clubs in Four Sticks. The adventure continues in Going To California with earthquakes when they're mentioned. Then in When The Levee Breaks you are escaping the town you find yourself in before their Levee breaks and then once you do you find the faggot binder man. <br /> <br />Music does different thing for different PPL but this is mine. <br /> <br />GET IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

B00004Y6Q5|5.0|From the thought-provoking 'Coney Island Dreaming' to the heartstopping 'Meltdown', this soundtrack contains by far the most beautiful, terrifying, inspiring and devastating compositions these two ears have ever heard.

6302800420|5.0|It was a close race for Dustin Hoffman, in 1982, when he was nominated for the Best Actor Academy Award, along with Ben Kingsley, for Ghandi.  Kingsley went on to win the award for his brilliant performance as the revolutionary Indian peace maker, but, if it hadn't been for that tough shut out in the Oscars race, Hoffman could've taken home the little golden man for himself, that year.  This is a great, great film that I think is enjoyable on many levels.  For starters, Hoffman's comic timing is showcased here, as his character, Michael Dorsey, an unemployed, down-on-his-luck actor takes on an alter ego in Dorothy Michaels.  Michaels is an outspoken, dowdy and very sassy middle aged woman who lands a major part on a daytime soap--launching his/her career.<br /><br />Not only is the humor fast and furious, in this movie, but it is also a touching portrayal of a man best-described as a chauvinist, who goes through an epiphany when he takes on the identity of a woman.  He has to do some soul searching as to how he relates to women in the world, and the general attitude men in society have toward the \\"weaker/second sex.\\"<br /><br />I highly reccomend this.
0062502182|3.0|I've read a story exactly like this one.<br /><br />The story is called \\"The Man Who Became Rich through a Dream.\\" It's part of 1001 nights.<br /><br />It tells the story of a man living in Bhaghdad that dreamt of a treasure burried in Cairo. He goes there and meets some bandits. He tells that he came in Cairo because of a dream. And a bandit laughs at him telling that he had the same story about a treasure in Bhaghdad and that he should not trust dreams and he gives the address. It was his backyard. Goes home and, what do you know, the same story like the alchemist. He actually finds that the treasure was in his backyard all along.<br /><br />It might be that Paulo Coelho he made up an identical story.<br /><br />Now, in Herik Ibsen's Peer Gynt there is a time when Peer becomes a bearded old man, an oracle in the dessert, in Egypt. He then falls in love with an egyptian woman (Fatima), and she fools him in giving up his treatures and horse away. Then he leaves the oracle business and goes to the pyramids, and talks with the sphynx. But he was not talking with the sphynx, but with a. Just read the book.<br /><br />Too many simmilarities. But I know that sometimes people create things that look the same. It's kind the same story word by word.<br /><br />Everybody was praising the book. I never read the book, somebody told me the whole big deal and I remembered the story from 1001 nights, and the piece from Peer Gynt.<br /><br />I do  have this book, I just don't trust it enough to read it. And I've already read the story from 1001 nights, so I don't have a lot to learn.<br /><br />Also, I recommend Peer Gynt to this book, as an alternative reading. It's a play, not a story.
6302561841|5.0|This was one of my introductions to Charlie Chaplin's brilliant body of work in film.  I must have been about twelve or thirteen.  While other kids were out watching Luke Perry and Tom Cruise, I had a growing love for early film.  \\"Modern Times\\" is a timeless, laugh-out-loud, very intelligent and insightful little picture about modern life, the plight of the assembly line worker and the \\"pick them up by their bootstraps\\" mentality that has been attributed to the growth--and sometimes downfall--of modern day American society.<br /><br />We meet the \\"Little Tramp\\" (Charlie Chaplin) once again.  This time, he is working in an assembly line, working the nine-to-five with no possiblity of promotion.  Eventually, the little fellow snaps, and begins operating on various things with his tools (this includes a fireplug and a woman's garments).  The film follows his adventures and misadventures in the world.  It is the era of the Great Depression, and a new job is not easy to come by.  He encounters the Gamin (Paulette Goddard), a struggling young woman who comes from a poor background, and is striving to just put food on the table for her family.  When their paths cross, inevitably, neither of their lives remains the same.<br /><br />Though, this film was made post \\"talkie\\" (i.e. sound was already incorporated into films several years before it was released).  Charlie Chaplin, director, star and writer, insisted that this body of work stick to the standard he had set for silent pictures.  Though, there is minimal dialogue toward the end (and one sentence uttered early on), Chaplin and his co-stars stick to the broad accessiblity of physical comedy and facial expressions, to convey to the audience what is going on in the plot.  This definitely works to its advantage.<br /><br />A great example of Chaplin's genius...which reminds me...I still need to buy this!!!
0192833804|5.0|Treasure Island remains, perhaps, the supreme adventure story for boys. It has all the classic ingredients - a brave and reasonably credible hero, pirates, a voyage, treasure, and an uninhabited island. At the same time it is worth reading, even re-reading, by an adult: it treats death and moral depravity realistically, and underneath all the excitement there is a note of sobriety and resignation. What puts it in a class of its own are two elements. One is the chief character, the one-legged pirate John Silver, who is both hugely vivid and psychologically subtle - so that by the end the reader feels he knows him well without fully understanding him, like all the great characters of fiction. The other is the plotting, that is full of brilliant twists that leave the reader gasping (even where they are partly predictable) and produces a series of memorable and well contrasted episodes.  <br />This is probably the best of Stevenson's full-length novels. His other two great works, in my estimation, are `Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde' and the `Fables', which come together in a volume in the old `Tusitala' pocket edition, which can easily be found secondhand.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I found the first episode heavy, there was not much humor, they place characters and start the main plot.  But after the first 2 hours, the serie get better as you watch every episode... <br />I loved it and I can't wait to see the movie in september <br />
B000002OX7|5.0|The 2nd best album you may be wondering?  Sorry, but #1 goes to Quadrophenia!  To get back to the album, <br />1 - Baba O'Riley, perhaps the best use of synths in a rock song, period.  Such power, such raw emotion. Listen up! <br />2 - Bargain, yet another song with great synths, great, if overshadowed by behind blue eyes <br />3 - Love Aint..., short, sweet, to the point, the best filler I've ever heard <br />4 - My Wife, ha ha ha, I love john!  Great horns, great vocals, with hilarious lyrics to boot <br />5 - The Song is Over, if slightly corny, a very nice finish to what was supposed to have been the end of \\"lifehouse.\\" <br />6 - Getting in Tune, gorgeous, simple, good old fashioned rock ballad <br />7 - Going Mobile, a nice pleasent townshend song, pleasent and fun! (For a better version, see \\"Lifehouse Chronicles\\" <br />8 - Behind Blue Eyes, one of the prettiest singles I've ever heard.  Great!  OH, AND BY THE WAY, THE WHO WROTE THE SONG IN 1971!! THEY ARE NOT DOING A COVER OF LIMP BIZKIT SONG, BECAUSE THE MEMBERS OF LIMP BIZKIT WERE NOT EVEN BORN AT THIS POINT!!! <br />9 - Won't Get Fooled Again, the synths, the guitar, the defiant vocals, and the best moment in any rock song, THE SCREAM! (you know what I'm talking about) make it the amazing song that it is. <br /> <br />BUY IT, I GUARANTEE YOU'LL LISTEN IN AWE!!!
0345475674|4.0|I recommend this book. For me it's strengths aren't in the mystery/thriller aspects. I don't care that much about Marcus Attilus Primus' search for answers to the disappearance of his colleague, but I never was a mystery person. And the love story doesn't do that much for me either. On both these things it's clear that Harris is getting out some of hooks to bring in a commercial audience. Which is okay.  <br /> <br />But what I like is that this serves as a vehicle to look at life in Imperial Rome. The daily job of the aquarius is fascinating, and the whole sun drenched atmosphere of the place really pulled me in. And definitely the best sections are when Vesuvius is actually erupting. It's such a visual, viceral, incredibly imagined rendering of one of humanities great natural disasters. The way the pumice stone fills up the bay... The cloud of ash spewing into the heavens... The heat and turmoil of it all... It's very vivid, and dramatic in a way that's a notch above any possible film version. Read it for this stuff, cause it's worth it.
B0006L5RT2|5.0|James Blunt's genre of music is what I would normally characterize \\"white boy music.\\" Simple guitar ballads that evoke classics like the Eagle's \\"Desperado\\".  But his lyrics take this album to a higher level; there is a quality to the songs that is so touching, so gentle and inspired, that I literally swoon.  I bought this CD for his song \\"You're Beautiful,\\" which I had on instant replay for about 48 hours. But his other songs are equally mesmerizing. Here is a singer/songwriter that reminds us of the gentle weakness of humanity, capturing the emotions from fleeting moment: \\"I don't think that i'll see her again, but we shared a moment that will last til the end. You're beautiful...I saw your face in a crowded place, and I don't know what to do, 'cause I'll never be with you.\\" Buy this. You won't be disappointed. One of the best albums released in a very long time.

0694526088|5.0|This book is the result of a study of companies which at some time were on the Fortune 500 list. Of these 1400+ companies they selected companies who had ten years of OK financial results, followed by fifteen years of stellar performance. Companies that met this requirement are considered to have made the leap from being a good company to being a great company.  <br /> <br />The study then looked for common factors about these companies in an attempt to find what had enabled them to make this leap from good to great. To greatly summarize their findings:  <br /> <br />People count. The CEO is extremely important, and usually is promoted from within having a deep understanding of the company.  <br />Don't kid yourself. Look at the hard problems, at the companies core competences, the market opportunities and make these fit together.  <br />Manage carefully. Support, promote and bring people along while moving forward with focus.  <br /> <br />Obviously they looked at past data. The interesting point will be to see if these companies retain their greatness down through the coming years.

B00003CXXJ|4.0|Shrek is a cute movie, it's not as cute or as charming as Monster's Inc or Finding Nemo but it's quite good and as some funny moments.

B0009KA7BS|1.0|Lackluster adaptation of the vertigo comic book that is only a fraction of the original source material and puts in a actor who can't live up to the character he is trying to play.  Keanu Reeves fumbles badly with his role and the rest of the cast follows suite with the lousy script that make them all look like fools. Only Rachel Weisz and Peter Stormare come out of this cinematic debacle with their heads high because they do more than the script does in this film. They give more to their respective characters than they should have and make the film a little better than it really is and that's no small feat considering the fact that Keanu and the rest of the cast do look like fools thou out the entire film thanks to the badly written script and lackluster special effects. <br /> <br />For Rachel Weisz and Peter Stormare, the film gets a four rating. The rest of the film does not even merit one.  <br />
B0009I7NNA|5.0|This is, in my opinion A7X's best album so far.  Everyone is bagging on Shadows for not screaming and that b/s, but IMO screaming is not singing.  I am not a fan of Sounding The Seventh Trumpet, because guitars so heavy you cannot even make out the different notes mixed with loud and annoying screaming does not form a song, IMO.  Also, people are saying that the whole band needs to stop copying other bands, and \\"find their own style.\\"  I must disagree w/ this, b/c w/ all this EMO and \\"Metalcore\\" nonsense these days, which may have been how A7X started out as a band, someone needs to bring the music back down to earth.  And I do not know of any band that has vocals and instrumentals anything like those on City of Evil, what with all the harmonization and overlapping vocals and guitars throughout the CD.  For A7X purists, this CD is not for you.  But, for those that can realize that the metalcore scene is just a fad, as A7X has, and can see a band that is maturing in all aspects of their music, then this is one great CD to have.  I think the reason that this CD has not gotten such a good response is that it is unlike anything that most A7X fans listen to, I believe this cd is the new breed of metal/hard rock, and it will just take some getting used to.
B0001MDP3G|5.0|I must say that I wasn't so thrilled to see this film.  I love war movies, but my idea of a good war movie is 'Troy' or 'Gladiator' you know, the real swords and sandles type stuff, but my wife was dieing to see this so we rented it and I was really taken back at how great it really was.  Clocking in at about two and a half hours you never really feel like your wasting time.  This film keeps you glued to the screen fromt he opening battle sequence to the closing supper.  I never wanted it to end, it was that good, and the acting on all acounts was supperb, even to the 'so-small-their-hardly-their' roles like Giovani Rabisi or Natalie Portman, or even Jena Malone who's in the film for a record thirty seconds.  I thought the most moving scene involves Jude Law and Natalie Portman and so as not to spoil anything about this movie I will leave it at that.  The movie starts with Inman (Law) getting wounded at war.  He is taken care of at one of the medical facilities for the soldiers where he recieves a letter from Ada (Kidman), his love from back home.  In breif flashbacks we get to see how their love was started, how they met and how they had that 'love-at-first-sight' thing going on.  The remainder of the movie is Inman's journey home to find Ada.  Inman in affect went A-wall and now the army is looking to kill him.  Ada is dealing with the death of her father and now having to fend for herself, somthign she was never taught to do.  That's where the heart of the film, Ruby (Renee) comes in.  She agrees to help Ada for room and board and it's her spunk that makes the movie fun, not just dramatic.  The entire movie, each little side-story, every cinimatical moment is worth it's weight in gold.  Watch this movie, it's splendidly done with OUTSTANDING performances by Law, Kidman, Renee, Portman and the entire supporting cast as well.  See this movie!
B00008G8M4|2.0|We all love our country and hope the USA does well in all endeavors; but other than the rah-rah sentiments expressed here and in the title, this film is a bore. An orgy of special effects masks a sappy script devoid of any content beyond bald information, as if the viewer needed a prompt to explain everything to death. Every character and event are borrowed from some other movie or medium; the only thing new here is the scale of weaponry, which after about 30 minutes leaves the brain numbed. Aliens (you can easily recognize them, they're the really ugly ones) are far dumber than the script claims, for with all their \\"advanced\\" technology they neglected to install anti-malware safeguards in their computer system. The good guys call their secret weapon a \\"virus\\" (which it isn't, but the target audience wouldn't know a virus from a doorknob). You have one-dimensional character types, ranging from a clueless President and a gaggle of low-level empty suits disguised as cabinet members, to a stripper posing as a heroine whom the First Lady thinks is really OK-cool (has Mrs. Bush seen this movie?). This film marks a new low in the now-eviscerated scifi genre. I saw its initial release and left the room for popcorn 3 times, having nothing better to do, then finally managed to make it all the way through the DVD on three cups of coffee for support. It's too long, too loud, and too pointless, with enough gasoline-spiked pyrotechnics to solve the energy crisis several times over. Youngsters will love its complete avoidance of ideas, though few will grasp that this is really an over-produced B-movie about battles fought with conventional stuff bloated beyond belief. Someone looking for a little more substance might try viewing an older sci-fi classic like \\"Colossus: The Corbin Project\\" for something more nutritive than this high-fat cinematic Twinkie. Overall, too low-octane for many tastes.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|I've long been a fan of the work of Errol Morris, but in this film he not only surpassed his previous efforts, he created one of the most genuinely terrifying movies ever made.  The terror comes from listening at length to Robert McNamara talk about his involvement in some of the crucial events of the past century, and realizing that the fate of millions and billions of people lie in the actions of men like this.  And there is nothing we can do but hope they get it right.<br /><br />This documentary, which won the Oscar for Best Documentary, was originally meant to be a one-hour television documentary.  But the brief interview Morris had scheduled with McNamara extended considerably beyond what was originally intended.  It is essential to emphasize that this is not a raw interview.  It is carefully crafted, enhanced by many deeply artistic insertions, and structured more by Morris's perception than by any preconceived notion of McNamara.  For instance, the \\"lesson\\" of the titles are clearly selected by Morris to better structure the overall interview, though these lessons are often somewhat trivia and fairly unoriginal.  The structure is probably the weakest part of the film.  Nothing else is.<br /><br />Along with some interludes dealing with McNamara's upbringing and education and his years at Ford, the film is essentially broken into three parts.  The first deals with the Cuban missile crisis, the second with McNamara's military service in WW II and in particular his job as an analysis for Curtis Lemay in the bombing of Japan, and Vietnam.<br /><br />The sequence dealing with the Cuban Missile Crisis was good, but most of the details are familiar to anyone who has read any books dealing with the period.  The truly scary part came when McNamara recounted meeting with Castro some years after the fall of the Soviet Union.  One must first remember that the blockade of Cuba was intended to keep what was supposed to be the first nuclear warheads out of Cuba, and that the U.S. was prepared to invade Cuba to prevent this.  What Castro revealed to McNamara was that there were already more than a hundred warheads in place before the blockade, and that had the U.S. invaded, he would have attacked the U.S. with nuclear force.  McNamara then asked Castro if he understood that the U.S. would have retaliated and destroyed Cuba, and was then told that he did so understand, but that he would have done it anyway.  He then added, \\"You would have done the same.\\"  The realization that Castro was right was the first truly scary moment in the film.<br /><br />In a way, the segment dealing with the bombing of Japan was even scarier, because unlike the Cuban Missile Crisis the worst truly did happen.  McNamara was an analyst charged, among other duties, of evaluating the effectiveness of U.S. bombing efforts.  He produced one paper in particular that indicated that the accuracy of the bombing increased tremendously as the altitude from which the B-29s dropped their bombs decreased.  Lemay's decision was to have the bombers drop their loads from 5,000 feet instead of over 20,000, and to use incendiary devices instead of regular ordnance.  The results were devastating, as city after city in Japan was essentially destroyed, including 95,000 in a single raid.  The enormity of this can be felt when one remembers that 58,000 American troops died in all of Vietnam.  Morris contrasts one Japanese city and the destruction wrought with the American city it most closely resembles in size, and the percentage obliterated.  Just imagine a third to over a half of almost every American city being destroyed.  That was what happened in Japan.  Now, I don't want to engage in a debate about whether this was justified or unjustified, or whether the Japanese people ultimately were responsible through starting the war.  The point is that an absolutely stunning number of civilians were killed in actions that were without historical precedent.  And as with the Cuban Missile Crisis segment, all I could do was look at the screen with the realization that such decisions are left not with me or my neighbor, but with men like Robert McNamara and Curtis Lemay.  McNamara quotes his former chief as saying that if the U.S. had lost the war they would have been prosecuted as war criminals for what they did in Japan.<br /><br />During the sixties, many regarded McNamara as the chief architect of the Vietnamese War.  In the documentary, as he has elsewhere before, McNamara indicates that his own preference was to pull out of Vietnam before it escalated, but that he was overruled by Johnson shortly after becoming president.  There is actually some credence lent to this by the inclusion of a phone conversation between Johnson and McNamara.  There are several other instances where he portrays himself as someone who waged a war in serving his president and country, but a war that he did not fully agree with.  Many will greet this with some scepticism, but wherever the truth lies, his involvement with the conflict is at the very least quite complex.<br /><br />In the end, it isn't important whether one believes McNamara's apologia.  What is crucial is that such men have charge of our destiny.  Are we to blame for this happening?  Or are such things above our control?<br /><br />The film is dominated by McNamara's monologues, but it is tremendously enhanced by many wonderfully wrought images by Morris and by an excellent score by Phillip Glass, though it is by no means one of his most memorable.  Absolutely no one concerned with good filmmaking should miss this, just as no one concerned with the ongoing health of the human race should.ban Missile Crisis segment, all I could do was look at the screen with the realization that such decisions are left not with me or my neighbor, but with men like Robert McNamara and Curtis Lemay.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Might as well be called, \\"The Adventures of Han Solo\\"... but without the aliens and StarWars characters. <br /> <br />I never watched this when it came out on TV, but boy were those producers shortsighted.  It came out when Stargate and StarTrek whatever were popular, and I always hated the fact that all the aliens were variations of humans. I guess I figured this was the same.  Its too bad that the contractual obligations state that this series cant be revived for something like 10 yrs... Im glad they got a multi-movie deal out if it. <br /> <br />A renegade bunch of smugglers that picked up an interesting \\"package\\".  The western theme of all the planets is interesting. Given all the technology to get around, they only visit terraformed planets and things are still pretty primative on all the Earth-like planets. THERE ARE NO ALIENS (except reavers, but they are still \\"human\\")!  The series has well defined characters and for the most part very believeable. The oppotunity to watch them in order makes a a big difference, as there are often hints to situations that happened in previous episodes. Apparently the episodes were not played in order when they were on the TV. <br /> <br />All in all, I thought it was a series which would have done very well if it had caught on. 5 stars.
B000929AJQ|4.0|Once again Trent Reznor gives us another version of The Downward Spiral.  This time he isn't trying to be different and not succeeding like The Fragile.  With Teeth is an honest attempt at making a Nine Inch Nails album.  It's not original and it is not ground breaking.  It is a good Nine Inch Nails album.  The first time I listened to it I was unimpressed BUT, the more I listened to it the more I liked it.  I can get into the groove of the record.  The Fragile didn't do that.  In With Teeth Trent gives us what we liked in The Downward Spiral and adds some new beats, (kinda) and some different melodies, (kinda) while making the album flow like no other in recent attempts.  It is a good listen.  It is great in the car.  The bass is incredible.  There is nothing that pops out and wrecks the flow of the album like Closer and Star****er.  Listen to this album as a whole work.  NIN hasn't done that since Broken/Fixed way back when.
B0009Q0F5U|5.0|I've enjoyed listening to Battlestar Galactica's soundtrack driving to work.  The music is remarkably varied and dramatic in its own right.  Listening to the CD has  piqued my interest to watch the series on TV.  I now want to see how the young composer's remarkable talent enhances the action happening on the screen. <br />I think Bear McCreary's special talents are a wonderful contribution to contemporary music.
0143034901|5.0|I stayed up until the wee hours last night finishing this book.  After a certain point, I just knew I wouldn't be able to sleep without finding out what happened next!  And, to me, *that* is the mark of a good book- when a person who always needs eight hours of sleep a night forces herself to get by on far fewer hours so that she can read a book that she could just as easily easily finish the next day.<br /><br />The book is translated really well- it didn't feel even a little bit as though I were reading a translation.  The writing is lyrical and beautiful and sets the haunting tone of the novel (except in the scenes, especially those with the unforgettable Fermin, that are truly hilarious).  At first, I thought it would be a typical mystery/thriller, but it's not at all like that.  Ruiz Zafon fully utilizes his setting of Barcelona during the revolution and after WWII to make a complicated story that, in the end, is just wonderful.<br /><br />For true bibliophiles, the mere possibility of a place such as the ingeniusly-named Cemetary of Forgotten Books is enough to send a thrill down your back.  And the way Ruiz Zafon describes choosing a book, \\"as though it were waiting for you,\\" is a feeling I'm sure any booklover has had, on finding and then reading what becomes a much-belovd book.<br /><br />It's plain to me why this book spent much of a full year on Spain's best-seller list.  And makes me wonder how many other truly marvelous books are out there that I haven't been able to read because they're not in English :-)  Definitely worth a read.

0064471047|5.0|In my humble opinion, THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE is the finest children's story of the past century.  The story contains both enormously imaginative touches combined with childlike simplicity, and the solid yet uncomplex prose belies a story of great sophistication.  It also is a story intended for children, yet so respectful of their intelligence that adults can read it with equal appreciation.<br /><br />There should be absolutely no controversy about where this novel should come in the seven-novel sequence that comprises The Chronicle of Narnia:  it is the first, and it is required to be the first both by the quality of the novel and by the way it fits into the overall structure of the series.  Shifting it from the first spot in the series to the second is quite possibly the worst publishing decision of which I am aware.  The justification for the change is exceedingly weak.  A child wrote Lewis saying that in their opinion the series should be read beginning with THE MAGICIAN'S NEPHEW, which tells, among other things, of the creation of Narnia.  Therefore, they felt that THE MAGICIAN'S NEPHEW should be the first and THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE second, with a subsequent reordering of the other books to reflect the chronology of Narnia instead of the kids that discover Narnia.  Lewis replied that he agreed, and this agreement is used as the excuse to reorder the books.  I have two huge problems with this.  First, my guess is that Lewis was, as a wise adult will often do, affirming the child rather than stating his conviction that the books should be reordered.  Second, even if Lewis did think the books should be reordered, it is not clear that he actually would have authorized it actually being done, nor that he would have resisted the efforts of any decent publisher to point out to him that reordering was a dreadful idea.  Why?  Because what is so magical about the original ordering of the series is that it focuses on the extremely subjective experience of the discovery of Narnia by children.  The original order maintains a chronology based on its exploration and discovery by children and in reading the books that is going to be the concern of any child or childlike adult in reading the story.  Who cares about the narrative from the standpoint of Narnia when the far greater concern is the narrative from the standpoint of children?  A lesser but still pertinent criticism of the reordering is that it places one of the weakest novels in the sequence in the first position.  When I first read the series, THE MAGICIAN'S NEWPHEW was, along with THE SILVER CHAIR and A HORSE AND HIS BOY, the weakest stories in the sequence.  Why put your worst foot forward?  The Narnia books are about to be made into a series of feature films by the Disney studios, and they have quite correctly decided to film the books in the original and correct order.<br /><br />As noted initially, THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE is a nearly perfect story.  The manner in which the children first discover Narnia, by entering it through the back of an ordinary wardrobe, is the most exciting entrance into a magical land at least since THE WIZARD OF OZ and probably ALICE IN WONDERLAND and THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS.  What they discover is a land under the worst of all possible curses:  it is always winter, but never gets to be Christmas.  The land is temporarily ruled by a beautiful but evil witch who entices children with Turkish Delight.  As literature it is all so delightfully perfect, and one marvels that an enormously literate Oxford don could have written it, though perhaps not so surprising when remembering that another Oxford professor, the mathematician and logician Rev. Charles L. Dodgson, wrote ALICE IN WONDERLAND under the pseudonym of Lewis Carroll.<br /><br />Of course, Narnia isn't really ruled by the witch, but by a magnificent, enormous lion by the name of Aslan, who, as we are often reminded, is not a tame lion.  Anyone reading Narnia will instant recognize a host of parallels between Aslan and Jesus, known as the Lion of Judah, but Lewis cautioned that no one should imagine Aslan a mere Christ figure: he is Lewis's conception of what Christ would have been like had he been incarnated into a magical land called Narnia as a great lion.  During the course of the book Lewis retells the story of the death and resurrection of Christ through the character of Aslan, yet he ever gets to the point of preaching or dogmatism.  A very close friend of mine, raised Jewish, was aware of the Christ overtones of the story, yet still declared that it was her favorite book as a child.<br /><br />This is also one of the books with the largest potential audience of which I know.  I first read and loved it in college, but elementary school children can delight in reading it, and even younger children can love having it read to them.  And it would take a pretty somber and sober adult to not be seduced by its beautiful simplicity.  Absolutely no one should deny themselves the joys of exploring Narnia, but make sure you start your tour with this book and not another.recognize a host of parallels between Aslan and Jesus, known as the Lion of Judah, but Lewis cautioned that no one should imagine Aslan a mere Christ figure: he is Lewis's conception of what Christ would have been like had he been incarnated into a magical land called Narnia as a great lion.

B00005JNSK|1.0|Strays from the book and becomes a morality play about estranged parents.  The original is still the best. <br /> <br />Dep acts creepy like a child molester in this film and he bears an uncanny resemblance to a mix between Michael Jackson and Marylin Manson. <br />
B00004S3AN|5.0|Ah. Jazz.  I love Jazz, so I don't know why I don't have more Jazz CD's in my collection. Anyway, I bought this because my father was always into Dave Brubeck (my dad got this when it was new), so I decided to pick something up to see what it sounds like.  The song on here named Take Five is something that I recognized instantly, so I must have heard this somewhere before - but God knows where.  The Super Audio CD version sounds incredibly clean on my home theatre system.  This really does show off the format, by making it feel like the guys are there - it's amzing how much better this sounds in SACD vs a \\"conventional recording\\" of the same songs on the same system.  I'm not one who can tell you when a time change happens, or how Joe Morello's playing makes this song better because of that bridge...  I just enjoy the music.<br /><br />This album is to Jazz what Back in Black and Led Zeppelin IV are to hard rock, or Michael Jackson's Thriller is to pop music, or Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon is to rock.  Get this.<br /><br />And if you have a Super Audio CD player, then you DEFINITELY need to get this - it's a showcase for the format.
0195073401|5.0|This book is highly comprehensive and quite necessary if you are a grad at a top PhD program.  The book is not always smooth sailing but very informative.   <br /> <br />My suggestion for grad students who are not used to a terse mathematical writing style such as the one found here is to read the first chapter (and possibly appendix) of Advanced Microeconomic Theory by Jehle and Reny, as the classical consumer theory material can be a bit intimidating (in part because of the notation).  Also, when reading the game theory sections it may help to read an easier book like Game Theory for Applied Economists by Gibbons along with MWG.  <br /> <br />In MWG I particularly liked the material on Production, Revealed Preferences, Uncertainty, Game Theory (Cooperative and Non-Cooperative), Moral Hazard, Adverse Selection and Mechanism Design.  I can't complain much about the other parts but there could have been more clarity in introducing classical consumer theory and I am not crazy about the approach taken to prove the second welfare theorem.  Also, some of the material on Equilibrium and Time is better looked at in a Macroeconomics book.
B00003CXWV|5.0|I checked the program guide, and saw that BLOW starring johnny depp and peleope cruz, only got 2 stars from critics and i know why. Because they dont want to make it sound like George Blung was some kind of a hero. But it deserved at least 3 stars, because of the excellent acting, and cast, and the way the biopic was written captured the sadness of the true story, and focused on what drugs do to a person's life, and how drug dealig is a path you never want to go down. I think that this guy wasn't a bad guy, and the only reason he got a harsh sentence in the end is because of the 3 strikes you're out. After being in and out of jail he continued to pursue his drug dealing \\"career\\" because in a way it's as addicting as drugs can be. And that's all he knew. After stopping the \\"business\\" he only went back to get money for his daughter, so he can see her and take her to california because that was the agreement he made with mirtha his ex wife. So the ending to me was very sad. And i dont understand why he said at the end that he would do it all over again if he had a second chance, that did defeat alot of things that the movie had suceededly made clear about that kind of life will never end with anything good. It's like stealing, it gets addicting after the first time you get away with it. Getting caught, the possibility, gives you a rush of adrealine. Like drug dealing, getting all that money. I mean come on george had 60 million bucks, and he still kept at it, and didnt want his partner to have his california connection source. It's the addiction of the drug dealing. It had to take him getting beat up and betrayed by his partner, to realize he should stop, and then he went broke, and wanted to do one final retirement score, and that happened to be THE bust, and sting set up by the fbi. But anyways, i think depp was fantastic in this film, and it's very entertaining i especially liked the cuban guy, who was depp's drug dealing partner. What a great great actor he is, andwho could forget pee wee herman, hehe. Also did an excellent job. And last but not least, penelope cruz who is so beautiful and such a great actress did her part well as usual. Have you noticed the wives always go crazy in these kind of films, like in casino sharon stone went nuts too. hehe.
B0002Y4TOM|5.0|One of the inside jokes in SEINFELD was that it was a series in which nothing happened, but in comparison to THE GILMORE GIRLS, SEINFELD can seem like an action series.  Things do happen in THE GILMORE GIRLS, but for the most part what happens is the characters talk.  And it isn't for the most part filled with pathos or venom or invective.  Even when characters are in conflict, it is intelligent, witty, restrained talk.  And even when characters are being mean to one another, the focus on the talk is not the way another character is cut down to size (something that rarely occurs on the show), but in the smartness and the intelligence of the talk.  If SEINFELD (and Larry David's CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM) is the premiere show for exploring the neuroses of human beings living in society with one another, THE GILMORE GIRLS is the series that most explores the joys to be found in people talking to one another.<br /><br />Season Two features some plot developments, but the events in the show are always tame compared with other shows.  Ironically, the rapidity of the talk and the energy in the dialogue always leaves me with the impression of each episode as being filled with a lot of content, though upon reflection the plots can be incredibly simple.  For instance, in the episode \\"A-Tisket, A-Tasket,\\" Dean and Jess have a fight because Jess outbids Dean for Rory's lunch basket (and the right to eat it with her).  Really, that is just about all that happens on the episode.  The action on nearly every episode is just slightly above the action in MY DINNER WITH ANDRE (hey, cultural references abound in the show, so why can't they in a review?).  The plot highlights of the year include such big events as Lorelai breaking off her engagement to Max, Lorelai discovering that her house has termites, Rory almost getting inducted into a secret society after the principal encourages her to get more involved in the social life of the school, Lane arranging to play on the drums a couple of days each week in the new music store, Sookie and Jackson get married, Lorelai and Chris almost get back together, and so on and so forth.  Now, the same kinds of things happen in soap operas, but there is nothing at all sudsy about THE GILMORE GIRLS.  There is zero pathos, and if given the opportunity to milk the viewer's emotions, the temptation is always resisted.  I read an interview with Amy Sherman-Palladino, the show's creator and creative force, in which she says that she was wanting to emulate the conversation that one can find in such thirties films as THE THIN MAN, in which Nick and Nora Charles (homage is even made to the pair in the title of the episode \\"Nick and Nora/Sid and Nancy\\") would casually knock about enormously witty, but somewhat detached, banter.<br /><br />The other thing that is notable in the show is the lack of anything seedy or scandalous in the town or the show, which is amazing given the fact that Lorelai's being a mother was the result of having gotten pregnant at age 16.  Jess is a bit of a juvenile delinquent, but most of the controversy in the town is generated by Taylor's endless crusades against one absurdly innocuous thing or another.  In one episode Paris decides to rip open the seedy underbelly of Stars Hollow, but the results are exceedingly meager.  All in all, the show contains less angst, less trauma, less conflict, and less drama than any other show on TV.  There is a lot of crankiness-Lorelai's mother being upset at one thing or another, Luke griping about one thing or another, or Lane's mother complaining about one thing or another-but little actual grief.  Even one of the big events of the season, Rory's breaking her arm in a car accident, is treated in a surprisingly subdued manner.<br /><br />Yet, the show really is brilliant.  Why?  First, the talk and conversation really is that good.  Second, the entire cast of characters form a marvelous ensemble cast.  If the writing was so consistently brilliant, and if the actors weren't so excellent at embracing their characters, the show would be awful.  As it is, it is one of the most entertaining shows currently on TV.d if the actors weren't so excellent at embracing their characters, the show would be awful.

B00001OH7T|2.0|Young Americans is clearly not one of David Bowies strongest or best albums. I commend him in his willingness to try new things but this, this clearly did not work, now dont get me wrong Bowie can be plenty soulful when he wants to but this album is just generaly weak all around. Most of the songs come across as sad wannabe disco numbers, or left over demos from a Beegee's album. Clearly the songwriting genius that is David Bowie was not present on the making of this album. Even though a few of the songs went down as classics that doesnt even come close to making up for a entire album full of lackluster efferts.<br /><br />The album opens up with the title track 'Young Americans' and while that song became a pretty big hit for David Bowie in 1975 it is not concedered a classic Bowie song and it most certaintly does not still get radio play. The song becomes tierd and old by the end of the second listen. While 'Win' is a decent ballad it's not a song you can listen to very often because like the song before it this one does get old quickly. 'Fascination' is a souless atempt at a soul song that every time I hear it, it makes me think it is a left over Beegee's tune that he snagged. 'Right' is a just downright boring disco song that like most of the other songs on this album gets old very very fast! 'Somebody Up There Likes Me' is a religious disco song if there is such a thing, its gosphol dance music, which is done very poorly, had this been on any other album, a glam or new wave Bowie album he would have made the lyrics work perfectly bu insted they go to waste on this porr excuse for a Disco track, if only he had held off on it for one more album and put it on Station To Station. It is very hard to mess up a song so good and classic as The Beatles (John Lennon penned), 'Across The Universe' and Bowie, while he doesnt do it as good or better then The beatles did he does do it very well. This is his second best cover song of his carear. It's not as bad as people make it out to be. 'Can You Hear Me' is a decent little soul number that I can actually say I do enjoy. The only good soul song on the album and he actually has soul when he sings it to which is always good, when your singing a soul song anyway. The next song is a classic among classics, one of David Bowies all time best songs. 'Fame' took the world by storm and earned David Bowie the privlage of being the first white person to perform on Soul Train, which is a really big deal even to this day. Not only that it was David Bowies first number one song in America and maybe in the UK as well. But whats more is the song is actually performed with John Lennon, how cool is that. 'Fame' was most deffinatley the right choice for how to end the album! To bad such a gem got lost on a lackluster of an album like Young Americans. I guess you could call it a diamond in the ruff.<br /><br />Young Americans is a bad David Bowie album theres is no other way to put it.

B00005JNSK|4.0|Being a HUGE fan of the 1971 film staring Gene Wilder, I had to wait a while and let the \\"hype\\" from this film's premiere settle down a bit before going and seeing it for myself. I heard some people hated it because it didn't \\"feel\\" like the Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory film they grew up with, while others applauded Tim Burton for making another unforgettable movie experience.<br /><br />Most of you reading this should (by now) know the story of Wonka: famous chocolatier closes his factory for many years because of competing chocolate makers stealing all his secrets. Then, suddenly, he decides to reopen the factory, but only to five children who find the five golden tickets hidden inside Wonka bars. The great puzzler that the world asks is \\"Why?\\" Why open up only to five kids and not the world? This is Willy Wonka's secret agenda and the climax to both the 1971 film and this 2005 \\"re-imagining\\".<br /><br />Hollywood is remaking EVERYTHING nowadays. I see this as a two-fold issue: #1 -- they seem to have run out of original story ideas (or at the very least have few left) so they're remaking what made money in the past; #2 -- they're trying (and successfully I might add) to tap into the X-Generations childhood love of certain films and bring them back to the big screen, thus pulling us (I'm an X-Gen, too) back into the movie theater to spend our hard-earned cash. I'm not knocking either possible philosophy. I mean, filmmaking is a business and they need to make money one way or the other.<br /><br />But what about this film? Well, it's engaging and interesting, if somewhat darker than the light-hearted musical we saw over three decades ago (most viewers shouldn't be surprised by this since it's done by the \\"master of dark themes\\" himself, Mr. Burton). But I can also see modern marketers inserting various items into the story in order to lighten it up a bit (the TV room is most notable for this with its homage to 2001: A Space Odyssey).<br /><br />Comparing them -- as one reviewer pointed out -- is like comparing apples to apples. And with respect to the screenplays, he/she is mostly right about that. But this film definitely took less liberties with Roald Dahl's classic book than did the 1971 version. And this film is also not a musical (only a select few numbers are done which mirror the book, and they're all done by the oompa loompas).<br /><br />I also enjoyed a more balanced approach to both Charlie's and Wonka's lives. We get to see more of Wonka and just about the same amount of Charlie in this new adaption.<br /><br />I also think that the casting was perfect. Charlie Bucket (played by Freddie Highmore) was an excellent choice for the main role. I loved him in Finding Neverland, and I still love him after I watched this. Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp) is creepy and gruff, but strangely enjoyable to watch. My only complaint here would be that I felt more of the \\"magic\\" coming from Gene Wilder's portrayal in '71. Here, with Mr. Depp, I didn't feel much magic at all, and only a bit of sympathy and bizarre revulsion toward what Willy Wonka had become. But still, Johnny Depp played him very well ...just differently.<br /><br />My heart still rests with the original film staring Gene Wilder, but this one is certainly entertaining enough to see on the big screen. Although the magic isn't present, there are still many other aspect that'll engage young and old viewers alike, and will surely cause very heated conversations about which adaption is the best.>Comparing them -- as one reviewer pointed out -- is like comparing apples to apples.

And this film is also not a musical (only a select few numbers are done which mirror the book, and they're all done by the oompa loompas).  <br /> <br />I also enjoyed a more balanced approach to both Charlie's and Wonka's lives. We get to see more of Wonka and just about the same amount of Charlie in this new adaption.  <br /> <br />I also think that the casting was perfect. Charlie Bucket (played by Freddie Highmore) was an excellent choice for the main role. I loved him in Finding Neverland, and I still love him after I watched this. Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp) is creepy and gruff, but strangely enjoyable to watch. My only complaint here would be that I felt more of the \\"magic\\" coming from Gene Wilder's portrayal in '71. Here, with Mr. Depp, I didn't feel much magic at all, and only a bit of sympathy and bizarre revulsion toward what Willy Wonka had become. But still, Johnny Depp played him very well ...just differently.  <br /> <br />My heart still rests with the original film staring Gene Wilder, but this one is certainly entertaining enough to see on the big screen. Although the magic isn't present, there are still many other aspect that'll engage young and old viewers alike, and will surely cause very heated conversations about which adaption is the best.
B00005UW9T|5.0|Anastasia is one of my all-time favorite animated films.  It is my opinion that it belongs with Disney's own \\"Masterpiece Collection\\" including Bambi, Cinderella, and the Little Mermaid.  The animation itself is done well enough, but the original soundtrack is what keeps my family coming back for more.  We love to sing along to those fun, sometimes heart-warming, lyrics with Anastasia, Dmitri, and Rasputin time and time again.  I would recommend this movie to anyone!
B000A3XY9Q|5.0|Im seriously excited about this release because im a huge evil dead fan, and this is my favorite movie out of the series. BRUCE CAMPBELL COULD BE THE GREATEST B MOVIE ACTOR ALIVE.  <br /> <br />Peace Out <br /> <br />-The Movie Guy
0393312836|5.0|Most fans of subversive literature (and film) probably already know what this book is about. Of course the story is casually violent, while the bizarre invented slang spoken by the goofy classical music-loving and philosophical young hoodlum gives the reading of the book a vaguely surreal and sarcastic quality. That's all fairly well known, so it helps to consider the themes on violence and state control that Anthony Burgess explores here. Alex the nogoodnick is weaned off of his personal violence when the authorities force him to watch state-sponsored violence, so how is the state less morally corrupt than the individual? The idea that violence can supposedly stop violence is probably the most brutally ironic theme considered here. Meanwhile, an average schmuck is used by competing political factions for their own small gains, and in the process nearly loses his humanity - while the state gets more and more control thanks to timid citizens who are willing to give up liberty for security. Sound familiar? Some parts of this classic novel are a bit worn out and are not aging too well, but you have to admit that it really makes you think. If you can viddy it. [~doomsdayer520~]
0895260131|5.0|Yes, read the Qur'an. In fact, if you want to learn about what Islam really teaches, all you have to do is read the Qur'an. Well, it is not that simple. For example, Ibn Abbas: Allah's Messenger (PBHU) said: \\"He who says (something) concerning the Qur'an without knowledge, he has taken his seat of fire.\\" <br /> <br />Even Prophet Mohammed said that ayat in the Qur'an are not to be interpreted by someone who possess no knowledge of what these texts are saying. This is why there is such a thing as Tafsir. Only by reading Tafsir will one understand the true meaning of each ayah in the Qur'an. Qur'anic commentators like ut-Tabari had left us with plenty of text explaining the Qur'an. If you have an Internet connection, there is Tafsir ibn Kathir, which can be access online through google search.  <br /> <br />My advice to all those who recommended the readers to \\"read the Qur'an\\" would be to read the Tasfir, Ahadeeth, and Sirat. Here's the ruling on physical Jihaad.  <br /> <br />1 - Taking the initiative in fighting  <br /> <br />This means pursuing the kaafirs in their lands and calling them to Islam and fighting them if they do not agree to submit to the rule of Islam.  <br /> <br />This kind of jihad is fard kifaayah (a communal obligation) upon the Muslims. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):  <br /> <br />\\"And fight them until there is no more Fitnah (disbelief and polytheism, i.e. worshipping others besides Allaah), and the religion (worship) will all be for Allaah Alone [in the whole of the world]. But if they cease (worshipping others besides Allaah), then certainly, Allaah is All-Seer of what they do\\" <br /> <br />[al-Anfaal 8:39]  <br /> <br />\\"Then when the Sacred Months (the Ist, 7th, 11th, and 12th months of the Islamic calendar) have passed, then kill the Mushrikoon (see V.2:105) wherever you find them, and capture them and besiege them, and lie in wait for them in each and every ambush. But if they repent [by rejecting Shirk (polytheism) and accept Islamic Monotheism] and perform As-Salaah (Iqaamat-as-Salaah), and give Zakaah, then leave their way free. Verily, Allaah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful\\" <br /> <br />[al-Tawbah 9:5]  <br /> <br />\\"and fight against the Mushrikoon (polytheists, pagans, idolaters, disbelievers in the Oneness of Allaah) collectively as they fight against you collectively. But know that Allaah is with those who are Al-Muttaqoon (the pious\\" <br /> <br />[al-Tawbah 9:36]  <br /> <br />\\"March forth, whether you are light (being healthy, young and wealthy) or heavy (being ill, old and poor), and strive hard with your wealth and your lives in the Cause of Allaah. This is better for you, if you but knew\\" <br />[al-Tawbah 9:41]  <br /> <br />
B00000K0EA|5.0|Pierce Brosnan returned in 1997 for his second appearance as James Bond in the 18th official Bond film.  Pierce appeared to me to be somewhat uncertain at points in \\"Goldeneye,\\" but in \\"Tomorrow Never Dies\\" Brosnan comfortably took on character of James Bond.  Double entendres were provided not only by Bond, but by M and Miss Moneypenny.  Female characters took the lead throughout the film, with Bond accepting the assistance of a female comparable to him.  The villain was truly wonderful and sinister in the grand tradition of Bond villains, and the gadgets were the best yet.<br /><br />We meet Bond at the beginning of this film doing what he does best, getting in trouble.  He is spying on a gathering of merchants selling military merchandise of various types and lethality, including nuclear weapons.  Watch this scene carefully as there is an important person at this gathering buying a rather benign looking device.  Unfortunately a shoot first ask intelligent questions kind of person ordered a cruise missile launched at the gathering before realizing there was nuclear weapons.  Bond is required to think fast to save himself and those who might be exposed to the nuclear fall out.  Bond comes through in spectacular fashion to open yet another James Bond movie.<br /><br />After Cheryl Crow sings the opening credits we see the H.M.S. Devonshire cruising in the South China Sea.  We also see a stealth ship launch a weapon at the Devonshire and at passing Chinese MIGs with the intent of building tension between China and Great Britain.  The man behind the stealth ship is media magnate Elliot Carver, chillingly played by the Jonathan Pryce (\\"Pirates of the Caribbean,\\" \\"Evita,\\" \\"Something Wicked this Way Comes\\" and numerous others), who makes being sinister into a fine art.  Carver has a nice simple goal: make news and be first to report it through the Carver Media Group Network (CMGN).  His master plan is to start a war between China and Britain to coincide with the launch of a new satellite news network.  Unfortunately for Carver, James Bond thinks a war with Great Britain is an awful idea.<br /><br />We soon meet an interesting cast of characters.  Teri Hatcher is Paris Carver, Elliot's wife and a former Bond love interest.  One of Paris's best lines is, \\"Tell me James.  Do you still sleep with a gun beneath your pillow?\\"  In many ways Paris reminds me of Andrea Anders (Maud Adams) in \\"The Man with a Golden Gun\\" because Paris also appears to have been caught in something much bigger than her, and to some extent she knows she is doomed.<br /><br />Michelle Yeoh is Wai Lin, a Chinese agent who is a counterpart of James Bond, and just as effective.  I enjoyed watching as Wai Lin and Bond treated each other with disdain and then slowly realized that they were more effective as a team.  Though Wai Lin does not have an equivalent of Q (Desmond Llewelyn), she does have a secret hideout with just as many interesting toys as Q usually has.<br /><br />Most of the best scenes in the movie involve Bond and Wai Lin, including an escape from a high rise, a leisurely motorcycle ride in Viet Nam, and a pleasurable cruise on a stealth ship.  The motorcycle ride is excellent.  The moment of surprise when Bond and Wai Lin both try to ride the motorcycle is real.  Both actors thought they were supposed to drive the motorcycle.<br /><br />I keep wondering when the creativity of the Bond series might begin to falter.  It has not with this film, which grossed slightly less than \\"Goldeneye\\" worldwide.  The ideas continued to flow and the plot is sufficiently convoluted to make watching the movie fun without losing the audience.  The acting is wonderful throughout, with one of the greatest Bond casts ever.  I will admit to being surprised when Miss Moneypenny told Bond that he was always a \\"cunning linguist.\\"  I would have thought that particular pun would not have made it past the censors.<br /><br />I am usually lukewarm to DVD extras, but I was impressedwith those on this DVD.  The two audio commentaries contained interesting and relevant information.  The \\"Secrets of 007\\" is a wonderful feature detailing the history of the series.  I was less than impressed with the storyboard overlay feature as well as the separate audio track.  However, some people may enjoy this feature.  The \\"Tomorrow Never Dies Video\\" by Cheryl Crow is also included, and is fun to watch regardless of whether you are a Cheryl Crow fan.  There is a visual effects reel, but I did not think it was \\"stunning.\\"<br /><br />Sean Connery will likely always be the definitive Bond for a variety of reasons.  However, this excellent movie, which won six significant awards worldwide and was nominated for six more, firmly established Pierce Brosnan as the second best Bond.  If you are a Bond movie fan or a Pierce Brosnan fan, or Jonathan Pryce or Judi Dench, this film is a perfect addition to your collection.was impressed with those on this DVD.

B00082IJ08|4.0|Was what I though the first time I spun this disc, since then the album has grown on me. I hear overtones of early Peter Gabriel when I lsiten to the album. This one is a keeper.
B0000683WG|4.0|It really annoys me when I have to give less than 5 stars to the album that helped me through my teenage years because the powers that be at Edsel can't \\"leave well enough alone\\". <br />I bought this cd as soon as it was released in it's single disc format, and then \\"Tanx\\" equally quickly because they sounded amazing. To cut a long story short I was burgled and 150 of my treasured cd's were stolen. To my dismay, when I tried to rebuy  this album I was told it had been discontinued. This was due to the fact that Edsel were in the process of re re issuing Marc's catalogue in 2 disc Deluxe form. <br />When they hit the store's I bought The Slider and upon putting it in my cd player and sitting back to once again enjoy the wonderous opening chords of Metal Guru....BANG...my speakers almost blew because it had been mastered at an ear splitting volume! It amazes me that in an age when we nearly all have access to the finest in musical reproduction technology (compared to 1972 musical reproduction technology)record companies still insist on making cd's ridiculously loud thereby preventing the owners of fine hi fi from truly enjoying their equipment. I digress. <br />My second gripe is the cover. Man, this image would have to be one of the most beautiful, potent images of a period in the 20th Century when the words change and youth were synonymous and T.Rex ruled the Earth. I had made a small(A3) poster of the cover taken from an old lp(vintage 72) and my first single cd looked identical. This one is almost an abomination. It has been enlarged so that the top of the hat is missing and also looks stretched vertically. To prove my point just look at the various versions after you enter a search for The Slider. I have searched far and wide for an Edsel single disc copy but so far, no luck but if you read this and know of a copy email me and I can certainly get $s to amazon for it. <br />Thanx and good night.
B0000508U6|4.0|I bought this album for the song \\"Yellow\\". At first I didn't like the album and it got shoved to the bottom of my cd collection. Later I dug it back out and forced myself to listen to it. Now I really like it. I listen to it when I'm tired or depressed. I've also been known to use it occasionally with my yoga practice. \\"Yellow\\" is still my favorite song on this album, but I've learned how to listen to this cd as a whole. If you're fond of Coldplay you definately need this cd, but it different than Rush of Blood to the Head and very different from X&Y. <br /> <br />
B0001LJC2K|5.0|My friend turned me onto Muse since he knew I liked RadioHead. One listen to Absolution and I was addicted.  <br /> <br />Yes, there are times when they sound like Radiohead, but to me they are a lot mure interesting musically than RH. For one thing, the guitar playing is really amazing. Not overly flashy, just very interesting. Then, there's the Piano that adds such a nice, at times haunting orchestration to many of their songs. <br /> <br />The thing that really stands out to me though is just how well all of the musicians play together and how they complement each other. The drummer and bass player definitely are not hiding in the background. They bass is quite busy adding very nice lines throughout all of the songs, and the drummer just rocks. <br /> <br />Their songwriting and chord progressions are really very unique in today's music. I would be very surprised if they didn't have classical music training.  <br /> <br />I'm not sure what the critics are saying, but I would bet that if Radiohead released this album, the critics would say it's the most amazing, revolutionary, blah blah record in a very long time. I'm afraid that this talent will not be fully appreciated because of that constant comparison. Anyways, I'll do my best to promote them. In conclusion, get this album now!!!
B00003CXS4|5.0|OK so ive seen Guy Richie's Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels and agree that Snatch has many similarities to that but that doesnt mean  that this is a bad movie in any sense of the word. Now with a similar plot comes some similar characters. But the characters (even though you have your stupid bad guys, real bad guys, and stuff) are very diferent. Or maybe its just that i think Guy Richie is up there with Quentin Tarantino in creating memorable characters. This movie is hilarious and smart at the same time.  Fans of Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels will love this movie.  And will like the film quality upgrade not seen in Lock, Stock.  This film offers funny characters, a cleaver plot, and a lot of smart dialouge. Now i agree with Amazon's reviewer that Guy Richie needs to switch it up a bit! We love your style Richie, now lets see what else you can do!
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|I was very pleased with my purches and I felt the price was good . I would recamend this to every one that loves music.
B000002LK1|5.0|Depeche Mode really knows how to make people aware of the mindful things in life. I was sitting at home one day, and came across this band called Depeche Mode and I knew I'd heard them somewhere before so I decided to play a sample track. The track, of course, was one of there most charismatic singles, \\"Enjoy The Silence.\\" I was amazed by the melodic symphony this performance had captured. It immediately occurred to me, that New Wave was a great talented genre in music. It had this diversion to it adding all sorts of focuses to a point of view. It was brilliant. So, I decided to buy \\"Violater.\\" I was absolutely blown away by every single song on this album. 9 songs, but still damn there good. It was worth the money. I'd rather pay $13.00 for a CD with 9 tracks that are worth the listen than pay $13.00 for a CD with 20 tracks and only about half being worth the listen. Depeche Mode is a very unique and enjoyable band to listen to. They enlighten a happy technique to their melodic dramas. I strongly suggest that you look into this band and make a plan to buy one of their albums.
0060763280|5.0|For anyone looking for complex and profound insights on the nature of business or the psychology of wealth, take a pass.  For anyone looking to confront your own reservations that prevent you from acting on what you probably already know this book is a great tool.  For anyone looking to transform your relationship to money, reading this book can only suggest actions you can take, but can't reach out and make you do anything.  Neither, I imagine, can attending a 3 day seminar which comes free with buying the book.  But the same is true of books full of investment advice, career advice, diet and exercise tips, or anything else in the self-help category.  If you let the confrontation about what you make money and wealth mean in your life open you up to new actions, and you follow through and take new actions, then your relationship with money will change.  That's the simple soap being sold in this book and I'm using it to clean up my financial act.
0316172324|2.0|It starts out very nicely, it makes you to read more and more in the beginning.  However, as I was turning pages after pages, I lost the main point.  When I reached the conclusion part, I said to myself... so what was the point of this book?  This book had too many examples and yes it's fun to read results of those psychological experiments and real life examples but they were just too much, I coudln't connect the dot at the end.
B000003TA4|3.0|I dont like Nirvana. <br /> <br />Just wanted to get that out of the way, now ill continue with my review. Nevermind changed rock music when it was released. It took the glam and excess out of rock and made it depressing and suicidal. I cant argue that this is not a \\"Great\\" album, because any album that can change what is considered \\"Rock\\" has to be important. My argument with Nirvana, and grunge, Is it takes the fun out of the music. Kirt Cobain was so obsessed with not being popular and mainstreem, he killed himself. Why? He was singing the music he liked, and killed himself because others liked it. That has to be one of the worst reasons ive ever heard to kill yourself. <br /> <br />In closing, ill say this. If you like grunge, this is Utopia. This is the album that made grunge popular. Its just not my style of music.
0767817478|1.0|Sometimes life can be so cruel. There was The Curmudgeon, itching in his cinema seat with excitement at the thought of seeing a mega-bucks US version of Godzilla. I really had high, high hopes.<br /><br />And then this - one giant Godzilla turd of a movie. Don't get me wrong, the Japanese movies aren't exactly Citizen Kane, but what they lack in coherent plot, effects and script they make up for in spirit, ambition and, dammit, a love for their monster.<br /><br />This movie looks good (if you can buy this image of Godzilla, anyway). The city being torn to pieces is excellent, but oh man, did they ever screw up the rest.<br /><br />No-one cares about the characters in Godzilla movies. The star of the movie, the reason people buy tickets - is for Godzilla. So the tedious sub-plot with Matthew Broderick (who really looks like he doesn't want to be here) is frustrating enough, but when they turn the movie into some lame Jurassic Park rip-off, with lots of LITTLE Godzilla's, you're left wondering who greenlighted this crap.<br /><br />Word to movie producers - Godzilla is SUPPOSED to be almost indestructible (how easily did he die?), he is SUPPOSED to be fearless (don't have him RUNNING AWAY from the army!!) and DON'T replace him mid-movie for lots of little dinosaurs.<br /><br />Not that hard is it? Well done, America - you just screwed up a perfectly good franchise. This still depresses me so much I can't even make an amusing quip. Deep, deep sigh.<br /><br />The_Curmudgeon_Hates_You@yahoo.co.uk
0895260131|5.0|My review is on the reviews of this book, <br /> <br />It is very complex what we see in the world and what is written on page.  The few exerpts I read from the book and then read the reviews of those who already have an oponion of Islam. <br /> <br />It will not change the true story we see and read every day. <br />It only supports the anger and plain disgust by civil humans. <br /> <br />I stand by my country USA and that of other Demorcatic nations who fight the terroists where ever they are.  To see those creatures who call a holy war, kill innocent people in the name of thier twisted religion is too much.   <br /> <br />The facts that are brought into this book, cannot be written for every event that happened.   <br /> <br />History is brought forth from those who took note and by word of mouth.  So in many cases the history is embellished or changed to suit those who use is for thier own Gain.  <br /> <br />The fact of terroists who use Islam as thier main course for Jihad is just use of evil.   <br /> <br />My friend who is Kurdish, reads daily news and recieves phone call of his family and friends plight there in Iran.  Women and children shot while walking in the street by extremist leaders and there crones.  Evil is everywhere and it runs rampante because there is no control over self worth and true love. <br />They breed on another because of the ingnorance of Life. <br /> <br />Those who support Extremist behaviour are to be dealt with in an extreme way.  Cowards they are, those who claim holy war. <br />These holy war individuals who now take to opening bombs in public places and run like frightened women. Hide and laugh while thier brothers die in the streets, yet pat one another on the back for jihad. ugh.  They actually sleep at night?  <br /> <br />There is no holy in what they do.  But evil awaits them to congradulate them in hell.  I truly believe that, they will get thier just rewards, do evil and you will meet evil, and not the virgins they aretold they will get.  Oh by the way? The women who blow themselves up?  What is their reward for dishonoring thier womanhood?
B000067CPX|5.0|This is one of the most beautiful albums ever to grace my stereo.  In no way does it resemble the Peppers of the 80's and early 90's, and in my opinion this is a good thing.  The band is writing MUCH MUCH better songs with Fusciante now taking over the majority of the song writing duties.  His harmonies are brilliant; his guitar work a perfect fit.  The man is a song-writing machine and the Peppers can really play the heck out of his music. <br /> <br />Soaring melodies, intelligent lyrics, textured vocals harmonies, experimental new sounds, crisp minimalist drums, and stellar bass lines.  It's ALL right here.

On what seemed like every other night of her life for the past six weeks, she is working nights at a dental clinic waiting for her pizza to arrive. On this night however, her boredom will end. She receives a phone call from the men who are hired to kill her. Shanna is in the witness protection program, after witnessing the murder of her best friend and testifying against the men responsible. That incident has ruined her life and career, for ever since that awful night, she has a paralyzing fear of blood.<br /><br />Roman Draganesti is a brilliant scientist, who has invented a synthetic blood to save the lives of mortals and vampires alike. Roman is a vampire, he has existed for over five hundred years. He is the master of a coven situated in Manhattan and has grown discontent with his \\"life\\". During an experiment Roman breaks one of his fangs, he has to find a dentist before daybreak, or he will be forever deformed.<br /><br />Thus our two protagonists meet. As Shanna is trying to escape, she runs into Roman, and thinks he is one of the men sent to kill her. When she finds out he is a patient who wants a fang put into his mouth, she thinks he's a weirdo, and before the night is through she'll think him a pervert too (which had me cracking up).<br /><br />This book was fast, furious, and fun! The scene where Roman and Shanna were trying to lose the men that are after her had me chuckling out loud. There are so many unique aspects to this novel, and in a time where paranormal romances are hugely popular, Ms. Sparks singular take on vampires will make her stand out among the rest. I loved the fact that her vampires had their own television network, and was impressed with her fusion cuisine, where Roman's synthetic blood creation is flavored with, for instance, chocolate and is called chocolood. To add variety to vampire diets.<br /><br />Shanna and Roman made a spectacular pair, their scenes together crackled with sexual tension and deep affection. How do a woman who is afraid of blood, and a vampire co-exist?  Ms. Sparks makes it compelling and entertaining to find out. I haven't even mentioned the kilt clad Scottish warrior/vampires who guard Roman, they were inspired. I found many characters that intrigued me, and I hope to see them in future novels. There is a villain, who is evil incarnate, and terrifying in his brutality, but he gets what he deserves in the end.<br /><br />How To Marry A Millionaire Vampire may lull you into a false notion of what lies between the covers.

B00003CXXM|4.0|In \\"The Bourne Identity,\\" audience favorite Matt Damon gets his hands dirty in an role that allows him retain all of his nice guy attitude but also kick tail with the best of secret agents ever portrayed on film.<br />Already having been made into a 1988 TV miniseries, this movie takes some liberies with the cold war plot of the original Ludlum novel but, its still one excellent thriller.<br />A man (Damon) is found floating more dead than alive in the sea by an Italian fishing crew. The captain, who knows a thing or two about surgery, tends to the man's wounds and removes two bullets and a microchip from his back.<br />After he recovers, the man realizes he has amnesia, with no clue to his identity other than a Swiss bank account found in the chip.<br />With no other leads to follow, the man travels to Switzerland and learns that the account is for a safety deposit box. The box contains an exorbitant amount of money, a gun and several passports and identities, one of which is Jason Borne.<br />Deciding to assume the Borne identity, the man barely has time to ponder his next move before a military squad and policemen ambush him.<br />As perfectly cast as Damon is for this role, the real star of the film is director Doug Liman, who hits all the right notes in setting up the drama and delivering with \\"pulse-pounding high-octane action scenes.\\" Now if that isn't on the next run of commercials I don't know what is.<br />When Bourne begins his escape from his pursuers via a fire escape, Liman doesn't just settle on the quick hop down. Bourne has to scale down the building and Liman pans the camera at just the right angles to show that this isn't something you'd want to try at home...that is, assuming if you lived in a 12-story high-rise.<br />Since no espionage thriller is complete without a romance no matter how trite it may be, Bourne has to meet some unattached female in some manner.<br />While on the run, he meets Marie Krutz (Franka Potente), coincidentally enough, an unattached female in need of some cash. Well, cash Bourne has and he offers Marie $10,000 for a ride to Paris. Guess he doesn't trust the Metro either?<br />Thankfully Marie is not portrayed as the cliched tagalong sidekick and actually significantly helps Bourne in his search for his true identity.<br />Bourne maps out this exhaustive plan for securing some information from a hotel only to have Marie get it by flirting with the hotel attendant.<br />It turns out that Bourne's pursuers are none other than the CIA, or rather a CIA division spearheaded by Ted Conklin (Chris Cooper), who wants Bourne dead while keeping his supervisor (Brian Cox) in the dark as to the real reason he wants Bourne out of action.<br />Rather than prolong the mission any longer than necessary, Cooper sends three assassins to terminate Bourne and tie up the loose ends of the last mission Bourne was sent out to accomplish.<br />Liman introduces the assassins perfectly, having each of them speak as little as possible, and only putting them on camera enough to remind the audience that they are a prevalent threat ... right until Bourne encounters them, at which point they become as threatening as Freddie Prinze Jr.<br />Not that Bourne has it easy escaping the local authorities either. In one of the film's best moments, he and Marie race through the streets of Paris in a mind blowing car chase the likes of which haven't been seen on the big screen in quite some time.

Well, cash Bourne has and he offers Marie $10,000 for a ride to Paris. Guess he doesn't trust the Metro either?   Thankfully Marie is not portrayed as the cliched tagalong sidekick and actually significantly helps Bourne in his search for his true identity.   Bourne maps out this exhaustive plan for securing some information from a hotel only to have Marie get it by flirting with the hotel attendant.   It turns out that Bourne's pursuers are none other than the CIA, or rather a CIA division spearheaded by Ted Conklin (Chris Cooper), who wants Bourne dead while keeping his supervisor (Brian Cox) in the dark as to the real reason he wants Bourne out of action.   Rather than prolong the mission any longer than necessary, Cooper sends three assassins to terminate Bourne and tie up the loose ends of the last mission Bourne was sent out to accomplish.   Liman introduces the assassins perfectly, having each of them speak as little as possible, and only putting them on camera enough to remind the audience that they are a prevalent threat ... right until Bourne encounters them, at which point they become as threatening as Freddie Prinze Jr.   Not that Bourne has it easy escaping the local authorities either. In one of the film's best moments, he and Marie race through the streets of Paris in a mind blowing car chase the likes of which haven't been seen on the big screen in quite some time. Meaning it's done in a manner that won't require audiences to suspend their disbelief to enjoy it.    The film's conclusion is a bit unsatisfying but makes sense given the way the story plays out.   Recommended.
B00008RH3L|5.0|To me, this film is an uncredited remake of Dashiell Hammett's \\"the Glass Key\\", and unlike the drippy version with Alan Ladd and Veronica Lake, this version deserves to be ranked right up there with 'the Maltese Falcon' and 'the Thin Man', completing the movie versions of Hammett's best novels. IF you love Hammett or these other films, this becomes a 'must own'.  <br /> <br />I've read a number of profession reviews, and none of them has ever noted this about the film. But the relationship between the boss and his number two is the same, the rivalries over the girl and with the rival gang are there - down to the 'beating' scene in the warehouse and the shifting allegiances of the police chief and mayor.  The girlfriend in the novel is a senator's daughter, but the movie's development of the Verna and Bernie characters are in keeping with the flow of the novel's story line. And if this isn't a remake of the Glass Key, then what's the thing with the hat ?     <br /> <br />Again, this is a brilliant film. I've read many of the other reviews here, and I agree with the praise they heap on this film. I'd only add that this is the role of a lifetime for Marcia Gay Harden; no other role has ever demanded so much from her, or given her such a chance to shine. And I wish I knew where the film's version of Addagio in G comes from.
B0009SQMIW|1.0|If you are not really a big Kansas fan, and just looking for a few Kansas songs \\"to have\\", Then this recording is probably ok for you. I can tell right off that true Kansas fans probably find this collection embarassing. So embarassing in fact, that this CD has been out since the CD format was in it's infancy, and no one, until me, has bothered to review it here. True Kansas fans probably ignore the existance of this recording altogether. First off, right at the opening of \\"Carry On Wayward Son\\", the first track on the CD, you can tell something is WRONG. The echo is overpowering, something that is not part of the original recordings. It gives the CD that \\"Electronicaly Rechanneled To Simulate Stereo\\" feel that you used to only get with cheap bargain bin recordings that were beefed up from the original mono masters. It's downright annoying. Plus, 10 tracks does not do the band's retrospective justice. Even if you are not a huge Kansas fan, you may find that the way this CD was re-produced may get on your nerves. My guess is that when the CD format was new, CBS did a rush job on it's back catalogue to get some of the old LP's to market on CD. Some joker at CBS decided to throw in a little extra echo to make the record sound like they did something special for the CD release. Well, it didn't work out like they planned. And it  shows. I am sure that there are other Kansas retrospectives on the market that better represent the fine work of this great band. I would suggest you seek one out, and pass this one up. This collection is better off as a distant, and very insulting, memory of how stupid some major label executives think we really are.
B0009KA7BS|1.0|Very bad Keanu Reeves film that could be one of the worse films ever made. Keanu sinks it up so badly that he should be thrown out of Hollywood all together and they should include the director and the screenwriters as well because the movie is as bad as Keanu's performance. Out of the entire cast only Rachel Weisz gives a real performance in this movie and she is so good in fact that she does almost redeems the entire film but not even her great talent could save it from the script, which is excruciatingly bad and the direction, which is as bad as the script and lacks focus for what its trying to accomplish.  The story makes no sense and manages to go against itself in certain scenes and the climax literally destroys the narrative that the movie was trying to build up.  <br /> <br />Maybe asking for a competed director and a lead actor who can act was a tall order for the producers of this film.  <br />
B00006HBUA|4.0|A show like \\"Scooby-Doo\\" could only have originated in the 1960s. After all, who would buy a preppy ascot-wearing All-American boy hanging out with a brainy chick (outside of school finals), not to mention an obvious stoner and his Great Dane (Daphne was another story) to solve mysteries?<br /><br />Of course, some network executive may think they've finally found the perfect show to follow FRIENDS on Must See TV so perhaps we should just move on?<br /><br />With the success of live-action movies of popular cartoons such as ... \\"The Flinstones\\" and \\"Josie and the Pussycats\\" (hmmn, there really hasn't been a successful cartoon movie translation, has there?) it was only a matter of time before one of the most beloved cartoon characters got the big screen treatment.<br /><br />The whole Mystery Inc. gang is here: Fred (Freddie Prinze Jr. who will no doubt get the last laugh on those \\"Spider-Man\\" directors for casting Tobey Maguire in the lead role instead) Daphne (Sarah Michelle Geller), Velma (Linda Cardelini), Shaggy (Matthew Lillard) and of course, Scooby-Doo.<br /><br />Just like \\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit?\\" Scooby is completely computer generated, which allows him to be just as animated as he is in the cartoons.<br /><br />Since the original source material wasn't exactly \\"CSI\\" or even \\"Murder She Wrote,\\" the screenwriters had to create a little drama and tension to make the big screen adaptation last a little longer than the typical 30-minute episode.<br /><br />A clash of egos leads Mystery Inc. to disband (Scooby sticks with his best-bud Shaggy since Velma may have been a whiz with mysteries but she was no great shakes in the kitchen) and for the next two years, enjoy life on their own.<br /><br />The gang reunites at the bequest of millionaire Mondavarious (Mr. Bean's Rowan Atkinson), the owner of Spooky Island, a spring getaway for college students. Apparently someone is turning the kids into well-behaved members of society via a mass brainwashing. Well, one thing is for sure. It's not affiliated with MTV in any way.<br /><br />The gang decides to work together one more time to get to the bottom of the mystery, but they all want to be the first one to crack the mystery while Shaggy and Scooby are simply interested in the all-you-can eat buffet promised by Mondavarious.<br /><br />Call me a risk taker, but I'm gonna go out on a limb here and put my money on Velma.<br /><br />Shaggy meets a girl (Isla Fisher) named Mary Jane - think about it for a second - who seems to be the ideal girl except for one thing ... she's allergic to dogs. And once again Mary Jane comes between yet another perfect partnership... but can Shaggy and the rest of Mystery Inc. get their act together in time to find the real culprit behind the crime?<br /><br />The film has everything that Scooby fans young or old have come to love over the years from Shaggy and Scooby's rather unique eating habits to Daphne's penchant for always getting caught by the villain.<br /><br />There's even a hilarious cameo appearance by Scrappy Doo, Scooby's scene-stealing mutt who thought he could take on every villain the gang encountered.<br /><br />Fans of the cartoon will eat this up like a fresh batch of Scooby-snacks. Sorry, I'm trying to get a quote worked into the film's next run of commercials.

B00005J8J8|5.0|In the case of Led Zeppelin's second album, chaos makes for great art. Recorded over several months in 1969 during the band's incredibly hectic touring schedule (during which they managed to conquer both America and Britain, though the UK took a bit longer to come around), Led Zeppelin II is the result of the band's astonishing jamming process, on the spot improvisation, the ability to thrive under pressure and lastly, their emerging group identity. Songs were written in concert, hotel rooms and they made use of whatever studios were available (in the case of Robert Plant's vocal in \\"Bring It On Home,\\" it was recorded in a studio no bigger than a bathroom). No doubt the band's aggressiveness supplied the incredible energy which drives the album from beginning to end. While the nominal leader of the band, Jimmy Page encourages his bandmates to fantastic efforts of performance. Plant's vocal blazes, Bonham sounded like no other drummer before or since, John Paul Jones' craftsmanlike musicianship and superb arranging abilities come forth and lastly, there's Page himself. His guitar work is nothing less than amazing and his production is first rate. While each individual performance is fantastic, what really emerges is that taken as a whole, the band I think, clearly established themselves as the best rock and roll band of 1969 and one of rock's greatest live acts ever. <br />   <br />This is not just a great album, but a work of art built to last.
B0006MT314|3.0|As one of the original fans of One Tree Hill, I was very surprised when I read the track listing for this soundtrack.  Evidently, the WB was bent on promoting new artists, rather than the ones who contributed important songs to the show.  A better soundtrack might have included \\"Calling All Angels\\" by Train, \\"She Will Be Loved\\" by Maroon 5, or \\"Dare You To Move\\" by Switchfoot.  To be fair, Gavin Degraw's \\"I Don't Want to Be,\\" One Tree Hill's theme song, is present here, as is \\"The First Cut is the Deepest\\" by Sheryl Crow, which she performed when she guest starred on the show.  These are both pivotal songs.  Keane's \\"Everybody's Changing\\" is a nice addition to the soundtrack, but other than, the songs are random, more so than should be tolerable for a true fan of One Tree Hill.
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|I gave this disc four stars cause I've only had it for Three days, but if my first instinct is correct then this is the best new album I've heard in a while.  I love it, it reminds me of the Self Titled album which in my book is their best...not much of a Toxicity fan!  I don't agree with it's polotics for the most part but it's about the music and it's some good music.  I've read people don't like that Serj doesn't sing as much, well he's a great singer but having Malakain sing only adds depth and slightly different perspective to the music...change is usually good.  Grab ya a copy if you like the band or if you just want some good music.

0767817486|3.0|I feel the movie does some good.  It doesn't deny that the main charector was wrong for what he did.  Remember, back in 1970, there was a more cavilier attitude towards drugs and he was dealing with the original 4 year prison sentence appropriately.  But being beaten, tortured and imprisoned in a foriegn country, with limited contact with family and freinds is going to be traumatic for anyone, and the movie dispays that well. <br />With that said, however, I think the movie deviates WAY too much from the book.  The escape first-handedly described in the book is much more fascinating and would have been better to see than the movies deviation.  The ommision of some the amnesties to prisoners makes the movie fall short as well. <br /> <br />The movie gets the basic point of the book across, but the impact could have been stronger if it just followed the story as laid out by the first hand recollection of it.
B0000508U6|5.0|Let me begin by stating that Coldplay, in my opinion, is the best band to come out in the past five or six years. Their music is simple, emotional, harmonious, beautiful, and inspiring. <br />To compare this album to the other two would be difficult. They are all flawless in their own ways. =) <br /> <br />Track by track.. <br />Don't Panic-We live in a beautiful world. Such a great, nice, easy song. The background electric guitar during the chorus is an example of what Coldplay does so well. <br />Shiver-A more \\"rock\\" song. A bit harder, but incredible nonetheless.  <br />Spies-Probably the most interesting song on the album. Lyrics are oustanding, as is the music. (Don't mind i say this about every song.) <br />Sparks-Extremely mellow love song that's a bit less poppy than \\"yellow\\". Excellent (with a nice bass line as well) <br />Yellow-Popular music at its finest, really. What a great, great, great, great love song. Perfect. <br />Trouble-A piano inspired song about regret. Fine part of the album. Chorus is exceptional. <br />Parachutes-Short, but beautiful. <br />High Speed-My personal favorite on the album(though all the others qualify). It's different, like Spies, with the more deeper questions of life presented in the lyrics. <br />We Never Change-Beautiful, slow. The melodic electric guitar parts are so so so beautiful and melodic. <br />Everything's Not Lost-Sing a long! Incredible, incredible with a surprise at the end. <br /> <br />All in all, I listen to this album more than I listen to X&Y. Though both albums are incredible, I enjoy the vintage Coldplay feel very much. Rush of Blood to the Head is equally as good as this. One must understand that there is no such thing as a \\"bad\\" Coldplay song. My least favorite song is \\"The Hardest Part\\" on X&Y, and it's not a bad song by any means.   <br /> <br />If you're looking to get into Coldplay, I would buy all three albums and listen to them in order and enjoy them all.  <br />It's very difficult to actually \\"critique\\" and review Coldplay because one can not find any complaints. Get all the albums, listen to them, enjoy them, cry during Fix You and close your eyes during High Speed and smile during Don't Panic and contemplate during Amsterdam and just let each song touch you in a different way. Enjoy the journey.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I loved this album!!! The songs are fresh and entertaining, most are upbeat with just enough of a slower tempo to be interesting.
B000002J03|5.0|This is not an album, this is a masterpiece. It is a classic, not just of rock music; this is a classic in all of music everywhere. Yeah, Led Zeppelin may have ripped off a few blues tunes but the group is so accomplished that you can barely tell because those elements fit seamlessly into LZ's context (the \\"squeeze my lemon\\" lyrics from Robert Johnson's \\"Traveling Riverside Blues,\\" for example).  <br /> <br />The main attraction of this album is its SOUND-the production is a little rough around the edges but gives the music LIFE. Jimmy's guitar tone on tunes like \\"Whole Lotta Love,\\" \\"What is...\\" \\"Heartbreaker,\\" and \\"Bring it On Home\\" has more balls than an entire pool hall, while his cool acoustic guitar solo on \\"Thank You\\" is also great--nice and delicate--something a guitarist like myself can more than respect. But it's not just the SOUND-the songs are what make the album. Let's face it, much like Jimi Hendrix, if Zeppelin didn't write kick-ass catchy riffs to support their sound, they would have ended up slogging in mediocrity (and now, obscurity) like other \\"heavy\\" groups like Blue Cheer and the mother of all mediocre '60s psychedelia, Iron Butterfly. How can you listen to \\"Thank You\\" and \\"Heartbreaker\\" and just be blown away with how musical LZ sounded?  <br /> <br />I mean, the album's not perfect, just like most Led Zeppelin. \\"Heartbreaker\\" sounds a little turgid and plodding compared to its later, faster live versions (such as on BBC Sessions & How the West Was Won), and \\"Thank You\\" would also later branch out much farther in the live arena with an organ intro and an electric guitar solo from Jim, but this album is head-and-shoulders above any music released in 1969 (with one possible exception: Abbey Road), and that says a lot. Buy this album and your life will be complete.
B0009I7NNA|3.0|The instrumental quality of this album is quite good. However, the vocals are horrible. M. Shadows went from being a powerful and versatile vocalist on WTF to nasal and annoying. Were it not for that, this would be a great album. Only if....
B00005JNNZ|4.0|This movie is based on a true story, but unlike most films which start off with that statement, this one doesn't need much \\"artistic liscence\\" to make it into a perfect Hollywood fairytale.  And that's because the true story of Coach Frank Carter and the Richmond Oilers stands on its own as a testament to the possibilities within all of us and the power of believing in yourself.<br /><br />That sounds cheesy but the film does not deliver this message in a cheesy or preachy way (for the most part).  Instead, it focuses on character and very action-packed sports sequences to tell its story, and it succeeds.<br /><br />Frank Carter is played by Samuel L. Jackson, who doesn't have to do much out of the ordinary to capture the grit and determination of this character.  His performance is excellent, as one would obviously expect from such a talented actor.  More noteworthy are the young men who play his players.  Each of them captures their character realistically and effectively and their performances are the heart and soul of this film.  Also noteworthy is singer Ashanti, making her film debut in a role she plays very well, and it isn't made flashier just because of her presence in it.<br /><br />The story doesn't end the way you'd expect it to in a movie -- it ends realistically instead.  In the end, integrity, along with the value of academic achievement over athletic achievement, are the morals of the story, not winning.  This is truly something that Hollywood should emphasize more often!<br /><br />The extras on this DVD are very good too, which is equally as refreshing and surprising!  One documentary introduces us to the real Frank Carter, who almost seems like a disappointment in a funny way since Jackson's performance is a lot more intense than the man himself is.  But he has obviously made such a great impact on his players and his community that there must be more to him than meets the eye.  One only wishes the documentary were longer, and explored more of the connections between the actual players and the actors who portrayed them on screen.<br /><br />A second documentary talks about the making of the movie itself, with emphasis on choreographing and executing the basketball scenes in a realistic way.  After watching this, it's clear why they succeeded in making these scenes so exciting to watch.  It does get a bit technical at times, however, which may be a bit dull for people who aren't very well versed in basketball and computer terminology.<br /><br />The one major drawback of the DVD extras is that we are NEVER introduced to the movie's director.  I don't know whether he's camera shy or simply didn't take a very large hand in actually making the movie, but he's nowhere to be seen on ANY of the featurettes.  I was particularly disappinted by this because the director's last name is also Carter, and I kept wondering if he had any relationship to the real Coach Carter.<br /><br />Overall, this movie is very satisfying and very uplifting.  I would recommend it to anyone as an entertaining film, but I think it should be REQUIRED VIEWING for ALL high school athletes who come from impovrished inner-city areas.  The scene where Coach Carter quotes the statistics about how young Black men have a higher likelihood of going to prison than to college is chilling, and should wake people up to the reality of this world: not everyone in this country can grow up to become a pro baller and join the NBA.  But ANYONE in this country can better himself through education.  That's the message of this movie.  And when it's over, I guaruntee that you'll feel like a better person for having watched, and learned it for yourself.players and the actors who portrayed them on screen.

B000002J1S|5.0|This remains the only album in my collection I've listened to more than 1000 times. Don't ask me why. It's as dumbasses as. Pure prog-rock balderdash, overblown pomp with pretentious lyrics by a bunch of ex-public school boys. Yet, yet... For a long time this was the only Genesis album I DIDN'T listen too, I just couldn't get it. But I persisted. Maybe span it up 20 times before IN THE CAGE finally caught my attention. The album grows on you but it requires patient listening. Eventually you get it and it takes over your life: every other album you own becomes two-dimensional in comparison. It is the only thing you want to listen to, and you want to listen to it every moment of the day. The secret, I think, lies in Gabriel's lyrics and his voicing of them. What those lyrics mean is irrelevant (did you know the song Carpet Crawlers is about ejaculation, for example?). The music, written separately by Collins, Banks, Hackett and Rutherford, which seems to follow any path it pleases across the soundscape, yet is never anything other than intimately connected to the lyrics. Don't believe reviewers who claim that the later parts of the album are padded with filler -- they just haven't listened to this masterpiece enough times. After this, Gabriel left the band, Collins took over as lead singer, and it all went downhill for Genesis -- not because Collins poppified the band but because no one left in the bad had one tenth of the lyrical skills of the Talented Mr Gabriel. A classic.
B0006L16N8|3.0|X&Y is just a big budget sequel to A Rush of Blood to the Head. Coldplay just decided to write songs similar to the ones they'd written but just give it a bigger sheen and production for arena rock purposes. <br /> <br />Their first single Speed of Sound is just Clocks worked around. A lot of the songs on the album seems like older Coldplay songs re-written but just bigger and more toned down for general consumption. Not that it's a bad thing; Coldplay do write good songs and this CD is a fun listen. <br /> <br />But, what I felt disappointed was that the subject matter - the songs are almost all love songs and songs about intimate relationships without a hint of cleverness or wit. I can imagine the people who'd go to Coldplay concerts if they weren't a stadium band - well to do couples (who prob. hold hands when Coldplay go into fix you or a message). <br /> <br />If you like your music nice and polite and saccarine like a Disney children's cartoon movie, then you'll love this - along with your mom and your pre-puberscent children.
031286504X|5.0|Though this novel is certainly quite well known, particularly amongst horror fans, it's not quite as famous as I'd imagine it would be, or as it ought to be, for that matter.  It's pretty damn influential, particularly in films as it was a primary inspiration for 'Night of the Living Dead'. (And, it was adapted for film twice, first as 'The Last Man on Earth', then as 'The Omega Man' (which it resembles in only the vaguest manner.)  But adaptations are quite entertaining I think, if far from truly satisfactory.)  Anyway, this is definitely one of my favorite novels, horror or otherwise. (Well, I'd probably call it a 'novella', but whatever)<br /><br />Some negative reviews have complained about this novel from a stylistic of scientific standpoint, and while they may have a point, I think they're kinda missing the boat.  Yeah, the whole scientific explanation for how vampires could exist doesn't work, but I've never heard of anyone saying they like this story because of the science.  This ain't hard science fiction.  In fact, it only loosely qualifies as sci-fi, as it is more sorta, 'apocalyptic horror'. (It is about *vampires*, for god's sake.) The only thing that bothered me much about the scientific aspect of this novel is that is comes as a sorta revelation to Neville that they could essentially be vampires, but that the condition was caused by disease.  Well, duh.<br /><br />At it's heart, 'I Am Legend' is about isolation, and the key to whether or not you enjoy  this novel comes from whether or not you can truly sympathize with Neville. (This is also true of Matheson's inferior but still enjoyable novel, 'The Shrinking Man', which contains even more improbable science.)  Personally, I find Neville to be just about the most tragic character I've ever encountered in media of any sort.  It may not seem too tough to make Neville sympathetic, as he's in an unimaginably bad situation,(everyone's dead but him, there are vampires, etc.) but Matheson makes the most of it, showing us his unspeakable loneliness, along with the crushing boredom and the dehumanizing brutality necessary to his new life.

B0002OERI0|5.0|Green Day have outlasted and outdone nearly all of their punk-pop peers, and here, over 10 years after the adolescent masterpiece \\"Dookie,\\" they deliver one of the most mature, focused, and ambitious albums in recent memory and certainly the best work of their careers.  \\"American Idiot\\" is simply bursting at the seams with top-flight melodies and songcraft, not to mention its inventive, suite-based structure and Billy Joe Armstrong's often vitriolic (\\"American Idiot,\\" \\"Holiday/Boulevard Of Broken Dreams\\") and even introspective (\\"Wake Me Up When September Ends\\") lyrics.  Nearly every tune is a keeper, and neither of the 9-minute monsters that flesh out most of the album's narrative are even close to boring, spiking themselves with rapid shifts, a battalion of interesting riffs, and Armstrong's elaborate pronouncements.  This album more than deserved its Album of the Year Grammy, and I can't wait to see what these guys do next.
B00005J6UP|5.0|This movie is a classic for all ages!  A movie children with watch over and over again!
B00005JLXE|3.0|After losing his eyes to a tragic nuclear<br /><br />waste accident, Matt Murdock (Ben Affleck) starts<br /><br />developing superhuman powers and all of his other 4 senses are<br /><br />more keen then they previously were. He lives in<br /><br />external darkness, but yet he sees the light in<br /><br />innocent people who he defends by day, and harms their<br /><br />perps that have been discarded by the justice system<br /><br />and thrown into his own brand of justice. He plots<br /><br />revenge on anybody that harms the innocent. He then<br /><br />takes on the man that is making him do his job.<br /><br />The Kingpin is his main enemy and he must bring him to<br /><br />justice before anymore perps get back on the street<br /><br />Well, I have seen some comic book movies bomb and fail<br /><br />to grasp what the comics are about.<br /><br />I also have seen some filmmakers tarnish what is held<br /><br />dear to some people. I have to say, This is how a<br /><br />comic book movie should be done. Everything is not<br /><br />perfect, but it gets its point across and makes sense<br /><br />and makes the film enjoyable to watch. Also, even<br /><br />though there were some horrendus actors, I have to<br /><br />say, that Ben Affleck pulled off the performance of<br /><br />Matt Murdock decent enough. I also thought that<br /><br />Jennifer Garner was just eye candy and Colin Farrell<br /><br />was wasted as Bullseye.<br /><br />There were humongous plot holes in this. I<br /><br />was absolutely questioning how some of the things were<br /><br />being done and why. Some stuff felt out of place and<br /><br />and didn't really gel with what was going on in the<br /><br />film. It really made the experience of watching the<br /><br />film less enjoyable. I do not like point out plot<br /><br />holes to myself when I am watching a movie. I want the<br /><br />director to make sure the film has no plot holes. When<br /><br />a film has plot holes like Daredevil had, it makes you<br /><br />question the writing of the script and the screenplay<br /><br />by whomever wrote it. It really ticks me off when a<br /><br />writer makes such mistakes when he is writing a movie<br /><br />and trying to insert plots. What the writer did here<br /><br />was a failure to express what was going on. The only<br /><br />thing that I liked about the writing/screenplay was<br /><br />that he kept it dark and grimy and evil and good.<br /><br />The acting by Ben Affleck barely impressed me because<br /><br />Ben Affleck isn't that great of a actor and in his<br /><br />other roles, he has failed to impress me with his<br /><br />chops. The only movie that I actually liked him alot<br /><br />in was Good Will Hunting and he was very impressive in<br /><br />that. Mainly, I prefer his counterpart, Matt Damon,<br /><br />who by far is a more accomplished actor than he is. I<br /><br />hate to say it here, but Colin Farrell was wasted<br /><br />here. He was basically the best performance out of the<br /><br />bunch and I was satisfied with his performance as<br /><br />Bullseye. Jennifer Garner is just eye candy, plain and<br /><br />simple. She was there to provide the steamy part of<br /><br />the movie when she has the part of Matt's crush,<br /><br />Elecktra. I cannot believe they decided to make a<br /><br />spin-off of a eye candy character. Micheal Clarke<br /><br />Duncan is, in my opinion, a decent actor at best. I<br /><br />feel that he has had one great performance in his<br /><br />career and that was in The Green Mile. Again, he<br /><br />failed to impress me as the Kingpin and I was left<br /><br />unsatisfied after the movie ended.<br /><br />The movie has its flaws, its sometimes<br /><br />good performances  and sometimes not so good<br /><br />performances . But it was still a entertaining movie<br /><br />that I enjoyed watching but had the experience ruined<br /><br />by the gaping plot holes, the sometimes cringe worthy<br /><br />acting, and the lack of where the film was going. I<br /><br />was enjoying the experience of a comic book on the<br /><br />screen but the flaws absolutely ruined it for me.

B0007TKNKG|4.0|Over the Top ruled! Lincoln Hawk is a down on his luck big rig trucker who tries to impress his wussy son with the powers of big riggin and arm wrestling. Unfortunatly, Hawk's mean father in law wants custody of the boy so Hawk has to get the Arm Wrestling First Prize money to win him back. Someone should have told him though that ramming a semi-truck through a house does not look good in court. A word of warning however, there are approximatly 600 mullets in this movie but Sly himself doesn't have one, so he has to compinsate by turning his hat backwards, which is the international sign of (A--) kickery. One of the better parts of the movie, (and most confusing) is when his son tries to escape his big rig truck and runs into highway traffic. Hawk catches him and grabs the child as he tries to struggle. It looks very, very bad and if I were a motorist and saw what was going on, I would call the authorities toot suite. Other then the cheesy 80's Pop and the pointless arm wrestler interviews this movie rocks.  <br />

Favorites include 911 Is A Joke, Welcome To The Terrordome, Pollywanacraka, Burn Hollywood Burn, Fear Of A Black Planet, War At 33 1/3, and the classic Fight The Power. Highly Highly Recommended.

First of all, I was thrilled to see my 24 year old daughter take an interest in my favorite legend. More importantly, you will not find a better collection of great songs on one album - they just happen to all be from the same man.

In a perfect world, the Special Edition would be the one released in two weeks.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|I bought this CD after seeing The Arcade Fire at the Hollywood Bowl. Although they were not the headliner, they should have been, we were all rocking in the aisles.  I love this CD, do not let the name distract you.  Several members of the band lost members of their family and that is why they named it Funeral,  but more than a tribute, it is the best new music I have heard in a very long time.  I can hardly wait for their next CD!  Great listening, or to dance to.  We took the CD camping and listened to it over and over the whole time.  The energy of the band is very high!  This band is very talented with instruments, including violin, accordian, and steel drums.  Buy it, you will like it.

Enough twists to keep things intriguing and my interest high, and, most of the time, right on target.<br /><br />My only criticism is that I found the ending, after the break-neck pace of most of the novel, a bit slow, relying on pointed social commentary rather than the subtlety that graces previous pages, and something of a let-down.<br /><br />Overall, however, Ender's Game is a winner, well worth your time, well worth giving to your kids (and that can be an iffy proposition these days!).<br /><br />Phyllis Staff, Ph.D.<br />author, \\"How to Find Great Senior Housing\\"<br /> and<br />\\"128 Ways to Prevent Alzheimer's and Other Dementias\\"

B000002L80|5.0|I still miss them every day, and this album (along with Speaking In Tongues) is one of the reasons why.  Great pop songs, quirky lyrics, funky melodies -- full-bodied music.  The four of them came together to do great stuff and, afterward, on their own, none of them have ever been as good again.
B000286RKW|4.0|Soon into this movie about New York mobsters. there's a long tracking shot: a young hood (Ray Liotta), flush with money and entitlement, escorts his date (Lorraine Bracco) into the Copacabana through a side entrance; the couple navigate corridors, a restaurant kitchen, and enter the crowded club; there, a waiter sets up a table for them just as comedian Henny youngman opens his act with \\"Take my wife, please!\\" Its a bravura sequence by an artist who knows how to make movies better than most.    That artist, director Martin Scorcese, is confident enough to cast in supporting roles his own mother and no less an acting legend than top-billed Robert DeNiro. Clearly, he has his priorities straight.    Liotta stars ingratiatingly as a youngster/adult who aspires to gangsterism under the guidance of the local capos (DeNiro. Paul Sorvino and Joe Pesci). Bracco strings along, enjoying the good life and raising their kids. All goes awry when Liotta falls afoul of the law and agrees to turn state's evidence against his former mentors, landing them in jail and he and his family in the witness protection program. The real man Liotta plays here wrote a best-selling book about all this and Scorcese collaborated with him on the script.    Scorcese shows us the daily operations of a morally corrupt group of temper tantrum sadists, murderers and thieves who nevertheless dote on family, value loyalty, and protect their own. Pesci perfects the first of many psycho killers he's played in other movies. Francis Coppola moved the narrative in a stately manner in his \\"Godfather\\" films, while Scorese drives his briskly here. \\"Goodfellas\\" isn't yet ranked in the same league, but that the comparison even comes to mind suggests its inevitablity.

B000002L9Y|4.0|Released in April of 1987, \\"Tango In The Night\\" was another smash hit album for Fleetwood Mac.  It's been reported that this was originally a Lindsey Buckingham solo album and that it morphed into a Fleetwood Mac album, which makes sense--the album was produced by Lindsey and Richard Dashut, and Lindsey is clearly in the driver's seat here.<br /><br />Sonically, \\"Tango...\\" sounds a lot like Lindsey's \\"Go Insane\\" album--his trademark looping synth parts are on heavy display, and his trademark 'speaking-hopping' vocals are also very much in evidence.  The key difference is that it sounds significantly more 'commercialized' than \\"Go Insane\\", which isn't surprising, not just because this is a Fleetwood Mac album, but also because \\"Go Insane\\" was a commercial disappointment (despite being an artistic triumph).  You can clearly see Lindsey starting to tumble down the mountain here, a slide that would continue with his \\"Out Of the Cradle\\" and the 2003 Fleetwood Mac album \\"Say You Will\\", although he is still pretty close to his \\"Go Insane\\" peak on \\"Tango In The Night\\".<br /><br />Lindsey has 3 solo compositions here.  The album-opening \\"Big Love\\" was a big hit--it's arrestingly edgy, with great electric guitar soloing and a great punctuative guitar lick on the chorus, but it's woefully marred by the out of tune chant-like background vocals, the incredibly annoying orgasmic panting (a \\"trick\\" he already had used on the \\"Go Insane\\" album), and the pompous coda.  \\"Caroline\\" has him going for his usual sexual intensity--it's catchy, has a cool jungle-ish atmosphere, and overall works quite well, but the song still feels rather unfinished and the verses have minimal, laughably easy-way-out lyrics.  It's followed by the title track which is one of the truly terrific tracks here--evocative atmosphere on the quiet verses, a guitar-powered chorus with an exciting ultra-long high note from Lindsey, and a really really good David Gilmour-ish song-ending guitar solo.<br /><br />Lindsey wrote the music for \\"Family Man\\" and shares the writing credit for the lyrics with Richard Dashut, which is kind of bewildering--it really took two people to come up with these lyrics?  The song basically wavers back and forth between just a couple chords all the way through, has minimal lyrics, plus dumb caveman-style vocal snippets on the chorus, but it manages to be a great song anyway, thanks to the bracing and catchy chorus, cool arranging details, and the sumptuous flamenco-style acoustic guitar work.<br /><br />Lindsey co-wrote 3 more songs with Christine McVie.  Of these three, Christine sings lead on two of them--the airy \\"Mystified\\" is a throwaway with incredibly slight lyrics; but \\"Isn't It Midnight\\", additionally co-written by Eddy Quintela, is a driving uptempo song with great Christine vocals, and the only thing really bringing it down is the dishearteningly rote, overlong \\"climactic\\" song-ending guitar solo.  The weirdly upbeat album-closer \\"You And I, Part II\\" is another irresistible tune, an excellently melodic pop-rock confection with great lead vocals from Lindsey.<br /><br />Of course, there are the pair of Christine McVie spotlights that were both big hits.  Her lightweight solo composition \\"Everywhere\\" is an infectious, neatly-arranged feel-good tune, although it is marred a bit by the embarassingly tentative-sounding 'speaking hopping' vocals on the fade (come on Lindsey--this should have been executed much better).  The minor-keyed \\"Little Lies\\", co-written by Quintela, is a gem, with a transcendant synth intro and a great vocal arrangement.<br /><br />That leaves us with the trio of Stevie Nicks spotlights.  The hit \\"Seven Wonders\\" is the only one that isn't a Nicks solo composition--it was written by Sandy Stewart with Nicks credited for additional lyrics--and it's the best of the lot with a nice ringing synth part, although it's a rather generic and sugary pop-rocker, and you can hear Stevie's voice faltering on it.  Nicks sounds downright laughable on the unintentionally hilarious ballad \\"When I See You Again\\" with its corny wordplay and the endlessly-repeated \\"what's the matter baby\\" chorus.  \\"Welcome To The Room...Sara\\" just kinda rambles along, lacking strong hooks, and has pompous Nicks vocals.<br /><br />So, admittedly, it's not the smoothest of sailing on \\"Tango In The Night\\", but this is a very interesting album with lots of great stuff.  Even \\"When I See You Again\\", as embarassing as it is, has definite camp value, as do a number of the other songs.allad \\"When I See You Again\\" with its corny wordplay and the endlessly-repeated \\"what's the matter baby\\" chorus.  \\"Welcome To The Room...Sara\\" just kinda rambles along, lacking strong hooks, and has pompous Nicks vocals.

B0002ONC4K|3.0|I can't but agree with the other reviewer. I knew these guys from England in the early 70s. True, they go everywhere (\\"discontinuity\\") but here and there (for instance, \\"Isadora\\", \\"Bathers\\"--the latter is ..well, almost more pop but what depth in this voice and the theme itself is esoteric--who knows of Lake Balathon), they really display impressive stuff. So, three stars is correct, unfortunately. Yet, I never gave up this album and \\"Snafu\\" which I bought 30-35 years ago as a kid (or so) and That may say something...
0449227421|4.0|This book, though it might be a tad predictable, still managed to keep me at the edge of my seat while I was reading it. It's very well written and has a gripping plotline.<br /><br />My only gripe would be the book has a lot of disturbing molestation scenes in it that are very graphic. The author might have gone a little bit overboard in his descriptions of them.<br /><br />Other than that the book was great.
B00005I44H|5.0|I am relatively new at buying classical music, so I really appreciate these reviews.  It was through these, in fact, that I first discovered Murray Perahia, and I LOVE his piano playing.  His interpretation is just right to me; while being technically perfect, he imparts just the right emotion--without ever going overboard or sounding mechanical.  His playing sounds so light, so flawless--he makes it seem easy.  You can feel the joy he has in performing these pieces.  I love them all, and I was thrilled to add considerably to my meager collection at a price I could afford. I also strongly recommend \\"Murray Perahia Bach Keyboard Concertos Nos. 1,2 &4\\" and \\"Murray Perahia Bach Keyboard Concertos Nos. 3,5,6,7.\\"
B00005V1WO|5.0|I happen to come across this movie at our local Kroger who were selling 10 DVDs for $10. I never saw any of Ken Russell's movies before. Considering that I love horror movies and also the fact that I'm a big fan of Mary Shelly's writings, I decided to pick this one up. The story tells of one night when her and her friends get together to tell ghost stories, a night that resulted in Mary writing the novel \\"Frankenstein\\" and inspired Polidori to write the short novel \\"The Vampyre\\". Getting increasingly hysterical and hallucinatory as the night progresses, her and her friends achieve a creepy state of disorientation by the end of the film that only a true fan of this kind of film could appreciate. I'll admit, I was a little put-off by the film and its' weirdness at the start but, once I got into more, it turned out to be a pretty good one. Dealing with the psychology of dealing with your own inherent fears was what this movie was about, and, in that respect, that's what made this movie a creepy and haunting thriller. Sure, the acting is a bit terrible at times...even downright horrible but that's what makes this movie so likable. It's, definitely, a trip to watch. This movie will appeal to those who like the weird, strange, and extreme. I agree, this movie is one that should have accolades of appreciation shown to it. I really liked it myself and I think it was money well spent getting.

B00004T9UF|5.0|The Second Album is just as Raw as the First One. I mean Raw like the First One. I you can't catch that quick, you need to read more books. Because what I'm saying now, probably might be in a Book, hey, words are older then a lot of people including me and sentences. Eminem makes sense, and some of the lyrics you won't ever catch. Believe me while you have the chance, I catch everything a Rapper or a Freestylest says. You should hear my music. By showing no Regard and Regardless of where I go or stop to, half of Camden (Dip-Set fans) tells me that, I Know EVERYTHING! EVERYTHING! EVERYTHING!

They said, when you die god forbids, there is going to be a lot of things left unsaid. I said, you got that right. I made mad songs without mentioning this stuff, My History I mentioned. Like in 1976 School Problems. 1978, Traveling New Jersey. Eminem will turn out better if he did these things. But he's about a Angry man. No Idea Is Original. That's true. Because when you come up with a Idea, mad recomendations come up and it's in relationship of how rappers start off and what style they have. Like A Different World Sitcoms, even though it's a Spin-Off, Bill Cosby loves to make shows the same way he did, but the Camera Graphics Allways Improves.

I can't believe I paid for a sales pitch.
0143034901|5.0|The Shadow of the Wind is a book about a book.  It's an interesting concept and a bestseller in Spain.  I would recommend this novel to everyone, especially if you enjoy books.  The setting is Barcelona in the 1950's, the characters are colorful.  There is mystery, adventure, tragedy, and love-something for everyone.  The Shadow of the Wind begins when Daniel Sempere is allowed to select a book from The Cemetery of Forgotten Books.  His selection The Shadow of the Wind begins his quest to find out more information about the mysterious author of the book, Julian Carax.  Daniel delves deep into the author's life and discovers that Carax's books are nearly impossible to find. Rumor has it that a dark figure with a limp has bought every available copy of Carax's books.  It is hinted that the copies have been burnt and the man with the limp goes by the name of Lain Coubert, a character right out of The Shadow of the Wind.<br /><br />The Shadow of the Wind is a well written novel, most certainly a great 19th century novel.  I'd like to say more about this superbly entertaining novel, but don't want to give away any of the plot.  My book group loved it!!
B0009IW9DE|5.0|\\"The Lonesome Jubilee\\" is the third Mellencamp masterpiece in a row. And here it is, in an exquisitely remastered CD. <br /> <br />From the Stones-y squall of \\"Uh-Huh\\" to the Springsteen sweep of \\"Scarecrow\\", we now have an album that can only be 'qualified' as \\"Mellencamp.\\" <br /> <br />His artistic growth here reflects his absorbed influences and then expands them. There are new instruments, new textures, new tempos. His lyrics are more expressive, more vivid and more concise. There is a fearlessness to his recording...a confidence beyond his previously problematic braggadocio. <br /> <br />In simpler terms, this album rocks. It's awesome. <br /> <br />Opening with the thrilling guitar-lap steel-fiddle-accordion-God know what else \\"hook\\" from \\"Paper in Fire\\", Mellencamp sets the stage for the unexpected. When his beloved drummer Kenny Aronoff kicks in, a smile will spread across your face. You instinctively will recognize his \\"sound\\", but also realize he doing more with it than he ever has before. <br /> <br />The angular \\"Down and Out in Paradise\\", with it's off-kilter push-pull rhythms, follows. This is one of those first person narratives with a terrific sense of immediacy...and \\"Check It Out\\" has a nice gentle, anthemic quality to it. I love the soaring fiddle-led hook, and so must have a lot of folks, as it's now one of his more-recognized songs. <br /> <br />\\"The Real Life\\" is a bit weaker melodically, but the band sounds tight and amazing. Every piece in its' place. \\"Cherry Bomb\\" has a soothing, friendly tone with terrific duet-like backup vocals and again, that lilting fiddle dancing above the whole song. Plus that accordion hook...it was an instant classic, and deservedly so. <br /> <br />\\"We Are The People\\" is where he falters a bit...a little too heavy-handed compared to the rest of the album. The music, again, is outstanding...it's now \\"his\\" sound. \\"Empty Hands\\" is another not-so-wonderful moment...a little boring... <br /> <br />It proves to be a momentary setback, as the album comes roaring back with three killer tunes in a row. \\"Hard Times For An Honest Man\\" gets the mix right. He's very direct with his point, yet the melody serves the lyrics, and the music is irresistible. \\"Hotdogs and Hamburgers\\" gallops along at a brisk pace, another one of his classic \\"story songs\\" with intimate details and epic bridges. <br /> <br />\\"Rooty Toot Toot\\" may be my favorite. It's a perfect song. Killer hooks, sweet instrumental breaks, a chorus you'll be singing before the song is over. Sure, it won't change the world, but for three minutes and 33 seconds, it will make YOUR world a lot better! Just a terrific way to end the album... <br /> <br />The extra track isn't much...a less-than-two minute snippet blues with multiple vocalists...the album was perfect as it was. <br /> <br />These remasters have been revelatory, and should urge other artists and record companies to reassess their catalogs. Bruce, U2, Prince...heck, the Beatles should be so lucky to have their albums treated with such care.
1400032717|3.0|Fifteen year old Christopher is the narrator of this curious book.  Christopher has Asperger's Syndrome, which means that he is extremely intelligent, but lacking social graces.  Wellington, Christopher's neighbors dead dog is discovered by Christopher who is accused of murdering Wellington.    <br /> <br />Like his hero Sherlock Holmes, Christopher likes to solve mysteries and so he sets out to solve the mystery of Wellington's death.  Eventually Wellington's murderer is discovered and the steps leading up to his clues provide insight into Christopher's own family life.  The journey along the way provides the reader with some of Christopher's quirks, like not being able to eat yellow or brown foods, screaming when someone touches him and the fact that seeing four yellow cars in a row will guarantee a black day. <br /> <br />The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time is a short, sweet, and refreshing book with many drawings and illustrations to help readers understand Christopher's point of view.
B000000XCH|5.0|Wow, what a great album.  Three singles were released from this album, with all a-sides and b-sides becoming hits.  In addition, the cover of \\"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\\" became a rock radio classic.  In all, 7 of the 11 songs on the album made in onto [[ASIN:B000000XB9 Chronicle]], their greatest hits album.  Of the other four songs on the album, three are great covers of 1950s rock classics.  The one other John Fogerty original is \\"Ramble Tamble\\", another great song.  This is an all around great album, which I highly recommend.
B00006DEFA|5.0|Milos Forman's movie \\"Amadeus\\" brings to life Peter Schaffer's play. This was a fictionalized version of the life of Mozart and Peter Schaffer, who is one of the foremost authorities on the life of Mozart never claimed it to be real. While the story was fictionalized, the music, costumes and people were not. Right from the time the Russian playright Pushkin wrote the piece \\"Mozart and Salieri\\", there were dark rumours that Mozart was poisoned. Murray Abraham played the part of jealous Salieri brilliantly. He is the only person who recognizes the talent of Mozart right from the beginning. Right from the beginning of the movie, the screenplay captivates you. The music in the movie was played by Academy of St. Martins in the Fields and conducted by Sr. Neville Marriner. This was put together beautifully with all the right pieces starting from the beginning to the Requiem to the ending of Salieri in the asylum with the piano piece. When this play and movie came out it created a deluge of interest in Mozart and in classical music among different people. The cast starting from Jeffrey Jones to Simon Callow did a very good job with Elizabeth Berridge being the only sore part.    While there are deviations from the reality, Mozart was never childish in front of people, the story ignored the impact of Haydn on his music, he was so poor that some people considered his pieces simple as he did not have enough time to compose them compared to more mature composers such as Schubert and Beethoven, he still was one of the most creative composers ever with one of the widest variety in his music. His relationship with his sister is not shown in detail, as his sister was also very creative and talented. Haydn remarked once that Mozart was the greatest composer of his time. At that time Haydn was reknowned and his opinion carried a lot of weight. Also, Salieri is not totally forgotten and I have a CD that ironically has two pieces, one by Mozart and one by Salieri next to each other. So him saying, \\"My music, growing fainter, always fainter until no one plays it at all. While his!\\" and the background starts one of Mozart's greatest piano concertos, is partly a myth.    When the research group went to the Mozarteum in Salzburg to work on the movie, they were rebuffed. The play was considered an anathema. After 10 years, when they went back to work on the collectors edition disc, they were welcomed. The people in Mozarteum considered it a unique cultural contribution which did not diminish Mozart's achievements in any way and enhanced the interest of the world in classical music and in Mozart. So, interest can come through fiction in a way one cannot imagine. This movie was wonderfully put together and people who saw it for the first time developed interest in areas of classical music such as opera. I, for one, consider that itself a success. The emotions of Salieri and his reactions to the music are passionately portrayed. The ending dialog, \\"I will speak for you father, I speak for all the mediocrities in the world. I am their champion, I am their patron saint.\\" will break your heart. The direction by Milos Forman was superb with no dragging on at any time. Some of the operas were filmed in the places where Mozart conducted them first, like the one in Prague. Every award this movie got is well justified. The DVD is also an excellent one and well worth owning for anyone who likes this movie. I for one like both the original and the director's cut. I like the additional pieces with Salieri in them. I would recommend the director's cut as long as people who do not like the nudity to fast forward that part. That was unfortunate, people who feel strongly about it can stick to the original version.
0974153001|5.0|I like the very concise instructions that are given throughout but I really like the detailed photos.  This book makes me feel that, with some practice (well, maybe a lot....), that I too can try my hand at sculpting with the many polymer clays out there.  Looking for more books by this author!

0385338686|3.0|Most of you have probably read Sophie Kinsella's other books: Shopaholic et al. and Can you keep a secret. The first thought that struck me as I began to read the book was: &quot;thank goodness, a heroine who has it together!&quot;<br />Samantha is unlike the other two heroines (Becky Bloomwood and Emma Corrigan) in that she's already smart and successful, all without a man by her side. She's a high powered lawyer in a top British firm and, even better, is up for partner. <br />This story is more about Samantha's personal journey than the love story. Her love interest, the hot gardener, helps her in her transformation but in the end, she has to help herself out of her fix and make her own decisions about where she wants her life to go. The story is not too believable (can you really learn to cook that quickly? and how convenient that the garderner is hot and sweet!) but we don't really read these books for believable stories... we read them to escape from everyday life. <br />So, although predictable and implausible, still a fun read with amusing characters that I enjoyed meeting. I think it's my favourite Kinsella so far, mainly because I didn't have a constant incessant urge to yell at the main character to stop shopping!
0312853238|4.0|This book was a required reading for school, so i can't say i was expecting much of it.  <br /> <br />The beginning of the book seems to have come from the middle of a full length novel. I had to start it about 4 times to get what they were saying. Terms such as \\"Third\\" and \\"bugger\\" and \\"desk\\" and stuff were introduced with no explanation, which threw me off a lot. And then the kid's ages were the most surprising. From the writing you would think that they were 19 at the youngest,  but they're only 6, 8, and 10. That was really confusing as well. <br /> <br />This lifestyle is very plainly futuristic. So, there are ideas that the writer has that will happen in the future, but they are only the WRITER'S idea, no one else's. So if you as a writer are planning to introduce ideas that exist in your mind only, you have to be very elaborate and explain it. Explain what it is, what its for, how it looks, blah blah blah so the reader can imagine it, and understand what is going on. Imagination can only stretch so far.  Ideas, however, were just dropped in there like it was an every-day object. <br /> <br />Not only were the ideas unexplained and vauge, something that i can live with, but the whole setting of it was very vauge. I never had the feeling that i could picture the situation if i wanted to, i just had to live with it. I never got the feeling, like in other books, that i was there with the charecter. I found this book to actually be almost tiring, because i had to fill in all the holes on my own and have to continually stop and figure out what the heck everyone is talking about. I found myself stopping and just doing something else, as if i was bored of the book. I wasn't though, it is a very interesting read. <br /> <br />Besides the mediocre writing, i thought that this is a must read for all sci-fi fans. This page turner goes by fast, and you won't regret reading it when you're done. For relatively fast readers, i believe a bookmark isn't neccessary. So tuck in,enjoy it, and read the sequels.
0312323859|2.0|This is the sequel to &quot;Something Borrowed&quot;... read that one first. If you liked it, then I would recommend this book. It's written in the same style and with the same flair and exuberance. <br />I started reading, prepared to dislike Darcy. However, Emily Griffin successfully narrates her character's journey of growth in a entertaining way which wins you over to the Darcy's plight. It was definitely a predictable (and not too realisitic) story but I still had fun along the way. Actually, I ended up liking this book better than something borrowed because it was less about guilt and more about growth.
B0007YMUZW|5.0|Ryan has recorded some really good albums i.e. heartbreaker or love is hell, and some mediocre stuff i.e. gold, or rock n roll... but he truly has done it this time, with an excellent backing band the Cardinals... This album has its songs I don't really care for as with all albums... but songs like \\"Meadowlake St.\\" \\"Mockingbird\\" \\"Magnolia Mountain\\" \\"Cold Roses\\" really make up for anything... They are fantastic and I believe are his best work... One thing that stands out is that he seems to be stretching his vocals more... they rise and fall over the warm tones of the hollow-body guitars and pedal-steel... This album is definitely worth the money and a few good listens because that's all it will take, its just that good...  <br /> <br />ALSO...I get sick of hearing people say things to the effect of Ryan Adams writes \\"too many songs\\" which seems to be the stupidest thing i've ever heard... if they weren't quality songs i would understand, but these are just that... and more is more... I look forward to the next to releases Ryan and these Cardinals have in store for us this next year because I'm sure they'll be as good as this one... I'll buy them on release day just as I bought this one
B00080ZG10|1.0|this movie sucked extremly, it was boring long, it felt like i was in the theater 4 like 17 hours, it had maybe 1 good scene at the end but this was after the hour of him locked in a room going insane and peeing in bottles <br />dont see it it sucked
B00005YXZH|5.0|This is possibly the best album I've heard in a while... EVERYSONG is great... This is a different Wilco album, it's experimental, less country, and purely genius... The lyrics are what catch me off gaurd.. Tweedy practically whispers these beautiful contradictions over soft strumming that evolves into waves of feedback and crashing symbols and reverts back into the same soft strumming it began with... In particular the song that touches me most is jesus etc. which just gives me chills... its truly a beautiful song... its what the rest of music should strive to do... BUY IT if you had already downloaded... the artists that created this masterpiece deserve it
B00000I07Q|5.0|i have been a fan of Bon Jovi since 1986 and had New Jersey on Vinyl so while i knew most of the tracks there were a few bonus tracks on the CD that were exceptional!!! Considering that it was only their 4th album its sound was much more 'mature' and it is one of the best albums to introduce the unconverted to. <br /> <br />rock on <br /> <br />happy listenin <br /> <br />shazza
0312954468|5.0|I am not educated in Egyptian history, so I cannot say which historical elements within River God are accurate or inaccurate; I can only say that I see no reason that ancient Egypt could not have had its own genius, its own Leonardo Da Vinci, and if this person had lived, this person would have probably closely resembled Taita the slave in Wilbur Smith's \\"River God\\".<br /><br />\\"River God\\" was such an enjoyable read that I lay in the high mountain meadows of the Hautes Alps for two days before I moved on, just so that I could finish the book. This is the first book by Wilbur Smith that I have read, but it won't be the last. The characters are so vividly written that one feels they must have been historical people; how else could they have been drawn so lifelike? Taita the slave watches over the lives of a young boy and a young girl who are destined to be together, but must first overcome politics, greed, jealousy and war while their nation moves forward into a troubling future. Throughout, Taita is there to mentor them and protect them if he can, sometimes at great peril, but his skills in art and medicine and engineering give him an edge that helps him to survive and save the day as each misadventure unfolds. During this period in history, even the wealthy would have found their lives filled with sorrow, pain and death. Disease would have taken its toll, as would political disfavor and torture. Smith does not spare his characters from these challenges, and makes them all the more real for it.<br /><br />The book reads at a good clip-I found none of the long, flat passages that one often encounters in historical fiction. If anything, the ending moved too quickly, resolving itself in a satisfying way while leaving open the possibility of a sequel.
B00005MIZU|2.0|this box-set is reasonably cheap but even its low cost has not been a consolation for my disappointment. Given my tastes, this is &quot;cold&quot; Schubert. To me the worst experience has come with the &quot;Unfinished&quot; symphony. One of the most tragic statement in music history is transformed in a lifeless, boring, scholastic exercise.<BR>Please give me back Furtwangler, Klemperer and Bruno Walter!!!
630521610X|5.0|Upon finding out there were some scenes (20 seconds all together) cut out of this version, I went on a hunt for a complete version, I brought an import (region 2) version to get the whole movie and for everyone whos wondering, there is no real big difference, I actually like this version better, so just warning everyone else not to waste time looking for a complete version because it's definatly not worth it.
B000009HF2|5.0|What can you say that already hasn't been said about this album? Maybe that the recording itself is so good that playing this on my first cheap little stereo system back in 1975 made it sound like more like a $1000 system. Some of the songs are very good while others are simply okay. But what really gathered me up about this live album when listening to it back then is Peter Frampton's guitar work. Some of the solos he plays on his Les Paul, especially the first and last ones on \\"Do You Feel Like We Do\\" and both solos on \\"I Wanna Go to the Sun\\" are just so incredibly vibrant and spectacular. And his band sounds pretty good as well. This is, overall, a marvelous musical work.
B000006O7C|5.0|..sorry if title looks bit messy , but I tried to sum what I think mainly about the album ..    Sketches contains more mature and more experimental tracks then Grace ; Buckley here swims around the new possibilities spreading on his horizon and do it with a hint more geniality then what's showed on Grace ; Sketches is on  the creative amusing side of composing music , but mainly same from the soul strings you should well know ...If you find Grace lyrical, creative , mixed pot of rock music with good poetic efforts , you will very probably be enchanted by this double release and will plunge deep into the music it carries ;  the mix and the record is unfinished , maybe remaining still more  touching , dense , different , and experimental then what it could gave been , who knows ..  Adviced , and higly adviced if you liked Buckley \\"Grace\\"

B00080Z53O|5.0|I saw this film with my father, and I remember just how I felt throughout the whole film. It just caused different feelings in both of us, in everyone else sitting in that theater. It is a delicate subject, and the sympathy Ramon provokes in you is beyond imagination... how you feel his pain, and his need. Maybe it is because I am Latin American and understood the language that the film appeared to me as 100% real, as something close to every human being. The acting is astonishing, no wonder Javier Bardem received a Golden Globe Nomination. This film deserved all the awards it got, and my recommendation to anyone is: watch it, you won't regret it.
0385338686|4.0|Samantha Sweeting is an overworked and highly successful London lawyer.  She is supposed to be promoted to partner in her prestigious firm; instead, through an odd chain of events, she loses her job.  In a state of shock she boards a train, gets off she knows not where, knocks on a door for an aspirin and for directions to the nearest hotel, and ends up taking a job as a housekeeper instead. <br /> <br />Since Samantha doesn't even know how to turn on her own oven, her first attempts at managing a country manor are pretty disastrous, and since it's Sophie Kinsella writing, they're also very funny.  Samantha's a bright girl and she gradually gains control over her job (which pays less in a week than she used to bill in an hour).  She also discovers that she finally has the time for a relationship, and fortunately there's a handsome young gardener on the grounds who fills that niche admirably. <br /> <br />To give you any more of the plot would be to give it away, and actually, most readers will be able to see the ending coming a mile off.  That's disappointing, since Kinsella's books usually have surprising twists in them.  For that reason, I'm knocking off a star.  But Sophie Kinsella is one of the best writers of the genre:  she's readable, entertaining, good the craft, genuinely funny, and her heroines are charming and appealing, and on those counts, this book does not disappoint.  Is it a deep read?  No.  But it's a fun one, and it's one that is over too soon.
B0009HLDFU|1.0|I have 3 iPods. I only listen to music on iPods (one in the car, one for working out, one connected to home stereo). I would never, ever buy a CD that doesn't let me listen to it on my device of choice. Seems very, very stupid to me. I'm also shocked that Dave Matthews would allow greedy suits to do this too. Totally suxs. Guess I'll just have to get them on iTunes.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|Dave Grohl of the Foo Fighters has really out done himself with this release.  Disc 1 is upbeat while Disc 2 is acoustic and laid back.  Every song on Disc 1 is great.  Disc 2 is good but there are a couple songs that don't hold up to the rest in my opinion.  I won't offer up the titles as I don't want to sway someone one way or the other.  As a consumer I apprecaite 2 cd's worth of music for under $20.  I think the price is a good value.  This cd is copyright protected so that's a definite BAD decision on the part of the record company.  I, like most, want to be able to take this album with me in the car etc...via .mp3 player which some self appointed genius decided that I shouldn't be allowed to do.  I understand the reasoning behind it but punishing those that buy the album is the very wrong way to go about it.  How did I solve the problem you may ask?  I downloaded a copy since it's readily available on every p2p sharing network.  I hate using p2p networks but unfortunately I'm not technical enough to figure out how to get around the stupid copyright protection thing so this is a perfect example of the RIAA shooting themselves in the foot - they drove me to what neither of us want!  Support the band, buy the album (and go to their shows) but if you need a copy and you're not technical like me your only option is downloading it...sad.
B00007GRCG|5.0|You get the original album, with 6 ADDITIONAL SONGS!!!!  And we're not just talking about \\"cast-offs\\".  We're talking additional B-sides that will get your booty shaking.  \\"Good Like That\\", \\"Boy\\", \\"Baby\\", \\"Butterfly\\", \\"Tightrope\\", and \\"Whenever You Feel Like It\\".  You all seriously need to purchase this Japanese import as it also includes the amazingly spectacular video for \\"Come Into My World\\" which will blow your mind.<br /><br />I bought mine used on here for half the amount.  I suggest you do the same.  I got mine within 3 days.  And on a funny side note...the outside cover of this japanese limited edition lists the song Butterfly as \\"Butterfry\\".  I swear...it does.<br /><br />I highly recommend getting this!
B00004YWAG|5.0|Hesperion XXIs recordings for ALIA VOX are generally even better than the ones they made for EMI, and this one is no exception.  Great artistic care has been taken with the arrangements to make this music really accessible to a wide audience.  Add to this a first rate realistic recording and you get a divinely beautiful and evocative sound. <br /> <br />The performances are of course faultless.  The ensemble playing is extremely precise, the singing is strong and engaging and the individual instrumentalists are all able to creatively express themselves within the mix.  Andrew Lawrence King on harp is captivating as always, and Jordi Savall's rich and creamy viol, well, simply the best. <br /> <br />A luxurious and mesmerising production.
0716703440|5.0|I bought this book about 25 years ago and I find it as good today as when I first got it. The writing is lively and lucid, with about ten times as much exposition as your typical physics book. It's probably not the best choice for a first text in general relativity, but if you read and understand what's in here you'll be well on your way to doing original research in the field.  But even if that's not your intent, the book can still be read profitably. Every section is a good read, and even if you don't read and comprehend the entire book, what you do read will be filled with the insights of these three relativity wizards.
0553812173|3.0|On a recommendation from a friend (and claims that Erikson easily surpasses Martin), I gave this one a try. It took quite a long time for me to get interested in what was happening--I had to slog through nearly 300 pages before I began to feel truly entertained by the story, and it wasn't &quot;work&quot; anymore.<br />Upon its completion, I have many mixed feelings.  Erikson is an excellent writer--most of the time. His scenes are well described, the scope of his world is immense, but sometimes his dialogue and character motivations felt decidedly flat. I at last realized that I cared very little for these characters. Take Whiskeyjack, for example. The sergeant is repeatedly painted as a world-weary man whose gone through hell and back, grim, gruff, and guarded. Readers are reminded of this constantly, and it is obvious that Erikson would like to evoke some sort of pity or compassion--it just never happens.<br />Another point where Erikson falters with his characters is their abilities. Nearly all of them are super-characters--they can essentially accomplish anything with their limitless powers. Meanwhile, the weaker ones are constantly saved via deux ex machina--divine intervention, or quick changes to an assassin's plan. I mean, come on--it's okay maybe once, but it happens constantly, and becomes far too convenient. On a related note, Erikson also likes dropping important plot devices necessary to resolve a conflict. For example, I'll mention Azath--you'll not hear of it until it appears, and effortlessly solves a previously monumental problem. Try looking for it yourself before it pops out of nowhere.<br />His magic system is my last major nitpick. Many shower praise here, drawing attention to its unique flavour and complexity. Frankly, while Erikson easily trumps Jordan's Wheel of Time, I prefer the latter's magic system of the One Power. People had limits here, and their power and spells were confined to what weaves they had a talent for, and how complex theperson could thread them. With Erikson...everyone just opens a Warren, and blasts everything to bits. What CAN'T his magic do? Why don't mages control the whole world? Why are there even militaries and expansive campaigns? Just lump a group of magic-slingers, and the army with the most should win. Truly, while his battles are very well done and full of the wonderful things that make a great action sequence, it's always earth-shattering, city-flattening sorcery.<br />Considering such faults, I would've given this title 2 stars. However, in retrospect, I do believe the overall story is worthwhile. The character interactions are rewarding, Erikson's world building is impressive, and one cannot deny this book's originality and grit. When the author's brilliant, he's brilliant, but unfortunately, this brilliance is slightly spotty.<br />While I believe this book is much overhyped, I am curious and would continue the series. There is a lot of potential here with the altered power and political scene, so perhaps with the debut novel completed, the next in the batch will prove to be more refined. Despite the barely better than average feeling Gardens of the Moon has left me, Erikson's vision, ideas, and incomplete threads has an undeniable pull.<br />I can't say the series matches the caliber of Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire just yet, but it may in time, and it'll keep me busy until A Feast For Crows is out anyway.
B000000H42|5.0|God, this is so good!  And so metal!!  No classic metal band has anything on Mercyful Fate.  King Diamond could eat Bruce Dickinson, Rob Halford, and even the mighty Dio for breakfast in the vocal department.  The songs blow Metallica's and Maiden's out of the water.

B000050XEI|5.0|This album is so mesmermizing and beautiful that I found myself showering about five times a day....just to keep wet and think about the rain.  At work I will often pour water overmyself just to be reminded of this beautiful ablum about rain.  I think this is probably their best album and makes me wish for rain each day. <br />Cuckoo ForCeltic
B0009W5JS2|3.0|OK, I admit I am not the target audience for a movie like this - so read this review with that in mind.  I rented this in one of those \\"aw, what the heck\\" moments.  I really like Samuel L. Jackson, Ice Cube, and Willem Dafoe and figured how bad could it really be.<br /><br />Well, if you like non-stop hyperactive action that exceeds all bounds of reality and physics, then this is your cup of tea.  However, I am not a tea drinker.  It really was an ok way to turn off the brain for a couple of hours.  There are a few plot twists and some action sequences that are pretty good.  But when it gets to the CGI portions, it isn't so good.  The super fast cars, trains, and low flying helicopters look like cartoons and the movie suffers from the break with the suspension of disbelief.<br /><br />Still, the actors do well with what they are given and I enjoyed it in that kind of mind numbed way that the movie asks of us.  Although without the performances delivered by the stars, this movie would sink like a rock in my rating system.
0393035158|2.0|Dr. Harris' book is basically--not entirely, but basically--an extended rant against Islam. While he has a valid point about the theoretical dangers of religious fanaticism in all faiths, his evidence focuses almost exclusively upon Islamic suicide bombers. Dr. Harris chooses to ignore, for example, \\"Christian\\" abortion clinic bombers and murderers. He also chooses to ignore--or at least gives very short shrift to--the fact that the unreasonable belief of fundamentalist Christians and Jews--that some mythical \\"god\\" supposedly \\"gave\\" the Middle East to a nomadic band of sheep and goat herders three thousand years ago and that this \\"gift\\" entitles their descendants to walk in and take over after a two thousand year absence--has caused far more misery and death than a few Islamic terrorists ever have. He also chooses to ignore that the fundamentalist Christians are doing their best to bring about Armageddon--the end of the planet, through nuclear holocaust, if necessary--and that even at their most intolerant and extreme the Islamic terrorists aren't going for world destruction. <br /> <br />I also have a problem with Dr. Harris' apparent belief that the West in general, and the USA in particular, are somehow morally superior to the Islamic people. It is true that by cherry-picking quotations from the Koran and from the Jewish/Christian Bible, one can make the case that Islam is a more violent religion than either Judaism or Christianity (and, I might add even though Dr. Harris wouldn't, the obverse is also true). But the record shows differently--the proof is in the pudding, as they say. For centuries, Muslims lived in peace with the Jews; Christians slaughter them. Hitler, after all, was a Catholic--never excommunicated--and the Catholic Church participated willingly in the Holocaust. Need I mention the Crusades, or the rapacious treatment of the \\"New\\" world by invading Jesuits, Dominicans, etc., or the \\"Christian\\" West's colonial policies?  <br /> <br />Even more appalling is Dr. Harris' moral blindness when it comes to specifically American actions. He excuses the American bombing, in 1998, of a pharmaceutical plant in Sudan on the ground that we mistakenly thought it was an Al-Qaeda facility and, after all, \\"we meant well.\\" Dr. Harris, I was always thought that if people of good will make a mistake they rectify the situation as best they can by reparing the damage and by compensating the victims of their mistakes. As far as I know, we have never even apologized for--let alone set right--the disastrous consequences of our \\"honest mistake.\\" Too, Dr. Harris, ignoring the larger question of morality in our invasion, goes to great lengths to assert (on faith, apparently, because he presents no evidence but simply parrots the Shrub's propaganda line)the extreme efforts the USA has gone to be gentle in its rape of Iraq. Failing to pay attention to our routine use of torture, the author seems to think that we should win points because our soldiers cry after they gun down innocent civilians. This is like going into a man's house, beating him to a pulp, making him watch while you rape his wife and daughter, stealing his money, and then claiming the moral high ground because you felt sorry for it later.  <br /> <br />Invading vietnam & killing upwards of a million of its citizens, carpet bombing, chemical warfare,My Lai? Forget about it--our soldiers were \\"horrified\\" by it; never mind that nothing was ever done to anyone in the chain of command, except for one hapless lieutenant--besides, \\"our intentions were good.\\" Terror bombing of Dresden, Hiroshima, and Nagasaki? Dr. Harris gives these terrorist acts by the \\"Christian\\" West no mention. From 1945 Hiroshima to 2005 Guantanamo, the USA has either committed or supported one terrorist atrocity after another--so many that it is safe to say that the leading terrorist nation in the world is the USA. Islamic terrorism pales in comparison. Yet, since \\"our intentions are good\\"--again a beliefthat Dr. Harris apparently holds on faith since we have no evidence for it--we are morally superior to a bunch of raghead fanatics who are giving their bodies so that their people might be free of foreign domination to be left in peace.  <br /> <br />Dr. Harris asks us--rhetorically, I suppose--whether Iraqi soldiers would be as \\"nice\\" to the civilian population in the USA as we have to Iraq's. On no evidence whatsoever--again on the faith Dr. Harris decries--we are left to conclude that the Islamists, who apparently never mean well, are savages. He fails to draw the obvious conclusion: that his rhetorical device is absurd. Iraq would never invade the USA--countries only invade those that are vastly weaker than they, the USA against Granada, Panama, and the Dominican Republic come to mind. <br /> <br />Anyway, racism, classism, moral snobbery, and a too-easy apologia for US terrorism aside, Dr. Harris makes some good points. Religious fanatics--Christian and Jewish at least as much as Islamic--ARE the number one threat to human survival, and Dr. Harris appropriately sounds the alarm. There's also some good information on how the brain works and how beliefs are formed. That is why this book gets two stars instead of one.
0380977788|3.0|Didn't seem like the kind of book i'd want to read to a small child, but didn't hold much intrest for adults either.  Nice pictures though.
B00005UKKF|1.0|Why would anyone in their right mind pay money to see this fake?
2067002627|5.0|Excellent.  I consider myself a World War II in Europe \\"fan\\", try to read all the books I can.  This has certainly made many of them more meaningful since I can now pinpoint locations in them.  Read about this map when Time published their 60 yr anniversary of D-day issue.  Tom Hanks mentioned it, but I hadn't been able to find it.  Googled, and there it was.  Amazon came through again.
B00005MP58|5.0|I absolutely love Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, and was a little wary of what the movie would be like.  But I was pleasantly surprised.  The movie follows the book very closely and most of the dialogue is from the book.  I agree with the other readers that it is very enjoyable and hard to not watch in one sitting.  Colin Firth is great as Mr. Darcy.  His looks are very expressive.  I think he captures the Darcy of the book perfectly.  The only criticism I have with the movie is that there are a couple scenes where they didn't bring out the drama from the book.  When Elizabeth reads Darcy's letter after her refusal of his marriage proposal, they do not have her read the whole letter, nor do they show the change of her feelings after she reads the letter when she realized how wrong she had been to be so blindly partial to Wyckham and so blindly prejudiced against Darcy.  Also, when he leaves her after she tells him her sister ran off with Wyckham, the movie doesn't portray the agony she goes through in the book.  In the book, she realizes she loves him now, but thinks she will never see him again because how could he associate with her when her sister has this relationship with his enemy Wyckham?  A sentence or two from her would have been great there.  She does say, \\"I will never see him again\\" in the movie, but just a little more would have brought out her agony.  The movie is fantastic, though.  Enjoy!
B00000K3D4|5.0|Well it has a lot of sentimental value to me. It reminds me of the good ol' days if you know what i mean. I watched this movie every summer and still do. Some beautiful work from set designers and Jim Henson's workshop for giving us some unforgettable characters. Also some great acting performances and some great musical numbers make this movie a hit for anyone. Enjoy!
B0009HLDFU|1.0|Once again record industry executives have demonstrated they are clueless.  Music has moved on, and they are still trying to control how we listen by limiting the usefulness of the the physical media.  Memo to Sony and the rest: If your product is incompatible with my iPod, I simply won't buy your product.  Period.  If you imagine that your lame music offerings are more important than the way I enjoy music in my life, think again.  Additional memo to Amazon: You might want to use your buying power to influence Sony's position on copy protection, lest you see your own sales go down the tube.
B00008EY65|4.0|I'm not that familiar with the Hellboy comics being a MASSIVE Marvel fan myself, but i did think this movie was really well shot in terms of it being based on a comic book. Now it might just be me, but when i see a movie based on a comic, i want it to scan on film like i'm reading the book. This movie achives this in dramatic fashion. I really enjoyed sitting and watching as each scene was like looking at a different panel on the page. Very good over all... enjoy!
0790744295|5.0|This is a great bunch of horror short stories. A lot of great actors are in these well done vignettes. George Romero and Stephen King have teamed up to make a work of art in this series of well-done stories of the macabre.
B000001DWG|5.0|Ok, I'm currently listening to this CD and all I can say is WOW.  And can I tell you this is probably the 50th time (or more) that I've heard it.  As far as Andy Wood's voice being whiny, get over yourself!  Apparently the other post doesn't know what they're  talking about.  They only listened to samples of the CD and compared it to Stone Temple Pilots and Alice In Chains,  BLEH!!  Ok, how about this, Mother Love Bone was around before Pearl Jam, Stone Temple Pilots, Alice in Chains, Temple of the Dog ( of course because that was formed after his death).  They WERE the example of modern day GRUNGE because they were GRUNGE!  Jeff Ament (of Pearl Jam)  was in Mother Love Bone before he was in Temple of the Dog or even Pearl Jam.   Where do you think the sound came from?  HUH?   But as for the forefathers of \\"grunge\\" I would have to say it is Mother Love Bone.  I bought this album in 1994 and it is absolutely without a doubt, one of the best albums I have ever had and listened to.  Andrew Wood is NOT whiny, he is incredible, there's no accounting for bad taste of some people.  You can listen to this album from start to finish and just get LOST in it.  I can't describe it any other way. It's absolutley amazing.  I have listened to it over and over again over the last 11 years.  Andy Wood IS a music genious and will always be known as such.   And I'm NOT saying that just because he's not here anymore!  It's a shame that life took him early because you know there would have been so much more awesome music from him.  He was the pioneer of grunge as I know it.  None of the \\"other's\\" that followed have really lived up to Mother Love Bone in my book.  You cannot put Mother Love Bone in the same book as Stone Temple Pilots,   I have even gotten my young nieces and nephews into it as they don't know what \\"grunge\\" is really.  They like it and really need to know what it was, it was a part of our generation.  Keep the music going...
B000002ADT|5.0|I waited for a while to buy a Miles Davis CD to make sure my musical tastes matured enough to receive his work.  \\"Kind of Blue\\" is the first Miles Davis CD I've ever listened to, and I have to say I am blown away by its beauty in every way.  It isn't just Miles but his band altogether - they make a perfect union on this disc and play absolutely flawlessly.  I was amazed even more when I read that Miles got ideas for these compositions a few hours before laying them down with the band, and the band cut these pretty much without any rehearsing, pure improvisation, just doing one take of each song (with the exception of the last track).  How the band could play the music so perfect in a setting like this is beyond me, but it happened, and each song is a masterpiece.  I first listened to this CD through my Beyerdynamic headphones (to make sure I can hear the full range of sound, as they are some of the best closed headphones around), and I just concentrated on listening, without doing anything else.  I sat there for 55 minutes, browsing the liner booklet that came with the CD and I had to have been smiling uncontrollably because I was simply taken and transported to an alternate universe by the magestic sounds of this disc.  I am glad I waited, and I am glad I picked this masterpiece to start with.  The only regret I have for this record is that it isn't long enough.  This is jazz the way it's supposed to be, and I want more of it.
B0009HLDFU|1.0|I for years have been a fan, and the music is great, but I think the decision to \\"protect\\" the CD is a poor one.  I am a male in mid 30's and have no intentions of file swapping, and I cannot play this on my computer at work, as I can with every other CD I own.  I did buy this disk, but will not buy the Dave Matthews disk, nor will I purchase any other Sony disk as long as they have this \\"incompatable\\" system.  I can use my money elsewhere, and not support the greed of a struggling artist and label like the FF and Sony.
B0000012XC|5.0|In an occasion Cortot played the first movement before the astute regard of the legendary pianist  Anton Rubinstein: He told him those indomitable words: \\"Beethoven's piano music must not be studied. It must be reincarnated.\\". That incisive but smart statement has to do with a grief comment of Menuhin  on 7th December 1954 about F&uuml;rtwangler: \\"Each time he conducted a work of Beethoven, he accomplished a sacred rite.\\"<br /><br />Nowadays the most of pianists lack of temperament. It seems they are afraid to think. They do everything in order not to think. Man has lost his instincts-has lost contacts with himself.<br /><br />According these Kempff  wisdom observations talk by themselves. \\"Each of us, ultimately has something like a motor in the soul and is born with an individual range of expression, and it is up to us to realize that range\\"<br /><br />The whole fulfillment of Kempff every time he played Beethoven's music would seem that assertive observation of F&uuml;rtwangler: \\"I could only conduct when the music sounds beautiful\\"<br /><br />Having in mind Kempff's  towering musicality, one convinces oneself about his honesty and craftsmanship: And it works out with every composer he played: Schumann, Schubert, Bach and Liszt. He played without apparent effort, without searching boasts of pianist  pyrotechnics or theatrical  effects to get gallery's applauses, but under himself and in the service of the composer.<br /><br />Buy this set; because sometimes the words seems to stain the best intentions and many times insufficient to express the absolute rapture state and total commitment of certain musicians of the highest level.
B0009HLDFU|3.0|First of all, it's important to note that I like Sony products and have recently purchased a Sony notebook.  Thus, I believe my opinion to be objective and unbiased.   <br /> <br />But to the point, there are several reasons Sony has decided to promote anti-piracy and furthering copyright technology.   <br /> <br />1. Sony MP3 players battling the mighty iPod <br />-Sony's \\"Network Walkmans\\" have had a history of copyright integration which forced me to shy away from them for fear of file type incapabilities.  This is of course so you buy a Sony mp3 player once and have to keep buying them for compatibility, like I did for a while with the worthless MiniDisc players. <br /> <br />2. First4Internet <br />-the firm accountable for the CDs' actual anti-copying technology, could potentially spawn into a plethora of who we once knew as \\"Napster haters.\\"  This new market for anti-piracy programmers will then of course lead to just more prorammers counteracting them.   <br /> <br />3. As artists become more and more worried about copyrighting and profits, Sony has shown they are willing to sacrifice complaints from listeners for the sake of just this.  Listen Grohl, Sony will protect your music no matter who complains!  Now that's security. <br /> <br />I usually stop at 3 reasons cause 2's not enough and 4 takes too much time. <br /> <br />Anyway, as far as the album goes, which I bought and haven't copied yet, the first thing I noticed after an entire listening is that there's no solid rythym to most of the songs, which is frustrating as a drummer.  I know Dave likes to shout, but I need some more of that singing like in \\"See You\\" or the Kroq acoustic version of \\"Everlong.\\"  That's what I thought the second disc was going to be like.  That singing with his catchy post grunge licks and hard drumming have become something that is rare in today's popular music.  It's good old American rock without the Redneckishness(sp?) of Skynyrd.  I guess every band has their time, and after a critically trashed fourth album, this was a change Grohl needed I think.  By the way, every Foo Fighters fan should download the Foo cover of \\"Have a Cigar\\" with Taylor Hawkins screeching mimics of Roy Harper.  That sh*ts tight.
B00005J6T1|5.0|Released in 1983. Copies sold:- 10,000,000. <br /> <br />\\"Madonna\\", released in 1983, was Madonna's first and one of her most slowest-selling albums. The album did not include many big hits, or made Madonna as famous as she is today, but it was her first step to it. There are some great disco tunes included in this album, and some of them proove to be Madonna classics, such as \\"Holiday\\", though it was not a massive hit when it was released. The other singles on this album are \\"Lucky Star\\" and \\"Borderline\\", which are also huge disco songs. <br /> <br />1. Lucky Star (5:38). #4 in the US. 10/10 <br />2. Borderline (5:19). #10 in the US. 10/10 <br />3. Burning Up (3:45). 9/10 <br />4. I Know It (3:44). 9/10 <br />5. Holiday (6:08). #16 in the US. 10/10 <br />6. Think Of Me (4:54). 9/10 <br />7. Physical Attraction (6:38). 10/10 <br />8. Everybody (6:00). 10/10 <br />9. Burning Up {12\\" Version) (5:56). 9/10 <br />10. Lucky Star (\\"New\\" Mix) {7:15). 10/10 <br /> <br />The overall percentage I rate this album is 96, as six of the songs I have rated get full marks, and four of them recieve nine points out of ten. The six songs I have rated ten out of ten are perfect. I especially love Lucky Star (both versions), Borderline and Physical Attraction. Holiday is also a great song, and a timeless Madonna classic. Everybody is also a brilliant effort from the Queen Of Pop! The last two tracks only come with the re-mastered edition of the album, and are worth hearing, especially the remix of Lucky Star. I highly recommend this album to any Madonna fan, especially beginners, as this is the ball-rolling effort from Madonna... An essential purchase.
0385505833|4.0|Skipping Christmas is not like John Grisham's other books but nonetheless an excellent one.  It is more like politically correct holidays if you will.<br /><br />The book is based on how the Kranks daughter goes to help the police corp in south america.  The Kranks will spend their holidays with only themselves for the first time in a while.  Mr. Krank then tries and sucessfully convinces his wife to go on a caribbean cruise instead of the christmas expenses and work they do.  The Kranks don't put up their frosty for the street contest every year (to the dismay of their neighbors), don't donate to the fire dpt. police, boy scouts (for the tree) and more.<br /><br />On Christmas Eve their daughter calls and suprisingly says she's coming home for the holidays.  The Kranks go mad trying to make it look like they weren't going on the cruise and get every thing set up.  It is hilarious as they try to get through the Christmas rush.  With help from their forgiving neighbors they make it happen.  The Kranks give their tickets to their neighbor's wife who was diagnosed with cancer.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone at any time of year. Hey, I had Christmas in July and enjoyed it very much.
B0007CNXUU|1.0|The CD is faulty.  It plays abour half was through, and then starts over again. I cannot get it to play all the was to the end.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I stumbled upon this cd a week or two ago, and picked it up. I wanted 'The Bends', but I got this one anyway. At first it wasn't that great, but it didn't hit me till today how good it was. I was walking down the street listening to Subteranean Homesick Alien and it was beautiful. I didn't like that spacy vibe given off by a lot of bands, but these guys pull it off beautifully. THe lyrics are awesome, and sometimes hilarious. Karma Police, my personal favorite, has awesome lyrics. \\"Karma police, arrest this girl, her Hiltler hair-do is making me feel ill...\\" It made me laugh so hard. The songs are all great, fitter happier is really creepy, and my favorite inturlude type thing ever. A great cd. Deserves all the praise around it.
B00003CX96|4.0|Just as the title of my review implies.  This is truly just a light-hearted film that should only be taken with a grain of salt.  If you love cycling, you should be tickled that a cycling movie has actually been made.  Just sit back and enjoy.
B0006L16N8|3.0|Before heads start turning, let me begin by saying that I am one of Coldplay's original fans. There is not a song or EP I have not heard. I have backed this band up from the beginning with their brilliant compositions and Chris' unique voice. When ROBTTH came out, I thought they were the best band of all time, past and future.  <br />I waited 3 years for the release of X&Y only to be surprisingly disappointed in the lack of beauty and creativity in the riffs and lyrics. <br />My Breakdown... <br /> <br />Tracks 1, 3, 5 & 7 all sound the same to me. They are upbeat songs with rushed lyrics. I look for depth, which Chris usually delivers. Too Radiohead for me. 6/10 <br /> <br />2- What If - The lyrics get better with this song but the composition is still missing something. 7/10 <br /> <br />4- Fix You - I feel that the first 3 songs ruin the genuine appeal of the lyrics of Fix You. It is a beautiful track, with an end worth listening to. 9/10 <br /> <br />6- X&Y - I consider myself a fan of Coldplay's slower tracks but I can't help loving this song. It has a great build up and addictive tone to it. 10/10 <br /> <br />8- A Message - This track marks the beginning of a good Album. Tracks 8 - 12 are the highlight of the record. The lyrics are meaningful but not too heavy. 10/10 <br /> <br />9- Low -  This song just has good placement. It could be categorized as sounding like the one's I grouped earlier but the chorus catches interest. 8/10 <br /> <br />10- Hardest Part - At times it sounds like Coldplays take on country music. None-the-less, the lyrics are something that we all can relate to in love and life. 10/10 <br /> <br />11- Swallowed in the Sea - Slower with an original arrangement of lyrics by Martin. 9/10 <br /> <br />12 - Eeerie sounding track by the boys that keeps you listening. 8/10 <br /> <br />I look to Coldplay for their different takes on love and loss, which is what they usually deliver but this album focuses on technologic aspects that just don't move me. <br /> <br />It's still a good buy...
B00008QSA5|5.0|The album is awesome!  I have the original vinyl and prefur the vinyl but non-the-less this album should be listened to and appreciated.  The first few songs are great because they are just jamming and really come up with some funky tunes! <br />thanks, paul gandy
B000002897|5.0|I got this album in 92 or 93, 12 albums for a penny :) <br />Never heard of them but thought the name was interesting. <br /> <br />A great sound and a great album. Normally it will take me a bit to warm up to an album or at least most of the songs, but I loved it on my first listen. How they managed to get left behind when grunge exploded I can't fathom. It vaguely resembled other stuff coming out of Seattle, but their whole sound was unique.  <br /> <br />Twelve years later, I still listen to it frequently. Probably one of the best albums of the 90s that you never heard.
B000089RVX|1.0|Frankly, this is not even worth writing a review about! Mainstream processed packaged velveeta cheez Whiz garbage. Britney Spears with a bad dye job and too much black eyeliner. About as \\"gothic\\" as Ashlee Simpson. Trite & boring lyrics, sub par musicianship. Nobody over the age of 13 could possibly find this interesting in any way. <br />I'm sure Evanessence is laughing all the way to the bank.
B0009KA7BS|3.0|Keanu Reaveswas bas as usual, the effects and the screenplay were great, but my comment is rather unusual. I believe that this movie presents smoking as a plaque sent from hell, as it would be described in Apocalypse of John. Think of it, Reaves smokes all the time, he gets a weapn called dragon's breath, he fights with a devil of smoke that is killed by a red van (red for stop). I do not know whether it was founded by the tobacco companies or by groups against them... smoking usually might sell subconsiously just by being bad. <br />-D <br />
B000002IR9|5.0|I had to write this because I couldn't believe that none of the people that already reviewed it mentioned \\"Are You Lonely For Me, Baby?\\" Definately the best song on the album and one of the best Otis ever recorded. The rest kick ass too.
B00008PC2O|5.0|Everybody knows this film, and if you not... Buy it!!!!

Absolutely amazing.

B00005JMYI|5.0|Ok, so all these people are saying the film isn't funny. They're saying it's stupid has no intelligence....Well jeeze the stupid person is you! This movie is classified under Stupid funny humor. IT's not trying to be annie hall or anything. This movie is showing off Will Ferrells comedic talent. IT has a lot of funny lines. IT is random but yet...it's supposed to be. Two thumbs up. It's a lot of fun.
B000005S0V|5.0|Too bad this album is an import, I got it at a regular music store for half of what it is being sold for here.  Aside from that, I think if you like Elton John but don't want to wade through all of his material to find his most memorable songs and biggest hits, look no further, X marks the spot, you have found the treasure.  Shop around first to see if you can get it for cheaper.  If not, you may want to consider getting it here.

The HMS Surprise needs to take out the Acheron before it can disrupt British interests in the East Indies.  Only problem is the Acheron is about the best built ship of its time.  It out guns and is quicker than the British ship a lesson Capt Aubrey learns more than once.  Only through brilliant seamanship and clever tactics could he survive and make his ship a worthy match. <br /> <br />This movie really illustrates what naval life was like back in those times.  It was a rough life occupied by a wide range of people.  This movie did a great job in its prop work and dialogue.  The story was good and the action was realistic and appropriate. <br /> <br />Who will like this film:  Anyone looking for a movie that incorporates early 19th century naval warfare with a bit of action as well as historical insights of the time.  You will also require an IQ higher than room temperature and have an attention span to match. <br /> <br />Who will not like this film:  People that have the attention span of a 3 year old.  People that are not interested in history.  People that are all around not that bright.  I would recommend watching Speed or something of that nature for these folks.  Something that requires little thought and can keep your attention with neat little explosions and zero storyline. <br /> <br />
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Never has there been so many Beatles hits in one place.  This kind of music is timeless even though it was made decades ago.  If you like The Beatles but don't own any of their albums, you have come to the right place.  Buy this album!
B000777J2S|1.0|With the exception of M.I.A. and the latest Weezer, this is one of the most unlistenable albums to come out in '05. The whole time I was listening to it, I could think of nothing but Tiny Tim. It's almost unintentionally humorous at times. An awful album that should have been dubbed \\"I Am A Turd Now\\".
B0000C1733|5.0|An album full of Red Hot Chili Pepper Hits!  Even if you are just a casual fan strongly consider buying this album.  It is thick with peppery goodness.  I am really happy to own this album.  It is the Red Hot Chili Peppers at their best.  If you are just going to own one Red Hot Chili Pepper album, make it this one.
B0000399WI|5.0|Shawshank Redemption is the only movie I've ever purchased for myself where my kids commandeered the DVD and I subsequently had to purchase the soundtrack so I could listen to the music without watching the movie.  The masterful way the story is unfolded through a mixture of real time, flashback and narration by Red (Morgan Freeman) keeps you glued to the screen from beginning to end - even after having seen the film several times.  Though I appreciate and acknowledge Tim Robbins' restrained performance as Andy DuFresne and the fact that the supporting cast is consistently outstanding, this is Morgan Freeman's star turn.  His expressive face is always a pleasure to watch.  Every track of Thomas Newman's soundtrack is evocative and haunting.  Several other reviewers have mentioned the shots in the field near Buxton -- you can literally feel the heat shimmer off the screen (subtle background insect sounds here make this scene).  No other movie I've ever seen can touch Shawshank Redemption for consistent excellence and thorough attention to detail.   <br /> <br />Bottom line:  everyone who took part in the making of this film should feel deeply proud of what they produced, and everyone who wants to feel the power of human hope and friendship should see it.  I've tried to think of another film that I thought was as compelling and meaningful and the closest I can come is \\"The Best Years of Our Lives.\\"
B0000024YL|5.0|You have found it!  The arrow has hit the bullseye.  This music is so sweet and mellow, the kind of music that you don't hear a lot these days.  Perfect for listening to when you want to lay back and relax, go to sleep, or when it is important to not offend anybody.
B000001G1E|5.0|this man was making the hottest funk of all time in the late 60's when psychedelic music ruled. \\"mother popcorn\\", \\"super bad\\", \\"sex machine\\", \\"cold sweat\\" and \\"give it up, turnit loose\\" were not for the faint of heart. this period features a young bootsy collins , the bass lines are spectacular. george clinton knew a good thing when he heard it, recruiting him in the 70's. the early 70's stuff wasn't far behind, \\"hot pants\\", \\"get on the good foot\\", \\"there it is\\", \\"the payback\\" and \\"funky president\\" being the best. the early 60's material is my least favorite. although there are many great songs such as the overplayed \\"i got you (i feel good)\\" and \\"papa's got a brand new bag\\". the best thing about this set are the long versions of many of the tracks and no fade in's and out's between part's 1 & 2 and sometimes 3. if you're interested in the original funk, it is essential. also check out all the george clinton/parlaiment/funkadelic/bootsy stuff. clinton is the second best funkmeister.
B000002OOY|5.0|Get this if you liked the music from the movie.  I did.  I like the inspiring main theme, and also mentionable is the cute and heavenly yet mysterious and occasionally ominous sounding song called Hatching Baby Raptor.  Aside from that, all songs are well done and orchestral in nature.  Enjoy!
B00004YKUY|1.0|Although Journey has been around for MANY years, they were basically nothing until Steve Perry joined up with them in 1978. Then, with Steve Perry, they became THE hottest band on radio for several years. When Steve Perry left the band, the Journey that we listened to on the radio and loved so much was literally gone. Now the band replaces Steve Perry with a new singer who just *happens* to have a name that rhymes with Steve Perry (gimme a break) and they start all over again. Sorry, it just isn't the same. While I appreciate that Neal and Jon still want to be out there rockin', they could have preserved the name of Journey and either waited for the real voice of Journey to return, formed a new band (which is what this is), or let Journey fade out gracefully so that we can remember them as they truly were: an over-the-top late 70's-early 80's band with the best lead singer ever.  <br /> <br />This \\"new\\" Journey booked a gig here in Reno, Nevada right around New Years Eve of 1998 or 1999. I was one of many people who lined up to buy tickets. I was also one of many people who walked away WITHOUT tickets once we were told that Steve Perry was not with the band. The confusion was heard from many people as they asked, \\"Then how can this be Journey?\\" \\"What do you mean Steve Perry isn't going to be there?\\" and \\"This must not be the Journey I was thinking of...I thought this was the band from the '80's.\\" People walked away, having zero interest in seeing a partial reunion of Journey members, which is exactly what this band is at this point. <br /> <br />Sadly, I think the current Journey is basically a tribute band, which is also reflected in the fact that instead of creating a new or unique sound, the band went to great extent in their attempts to replace Steve Perry with a look-alike and sound-alike lead singer. You have one or two original Journey members here, but all the other members are new people, tossed in over the years to fill in the gaps. Sorry, that's NOT the Journey people loved and grew up with.  <br /> <br />If this band was creating music under a different name, instead of trying to impersonate a classic band, they might find that more people accepted them. I have only heard ONE song from this new Journey make it to the radio in the last several years, and that speaks volumes. <br />
B00000I07P|5.0|This album is worth the money for the first three tracks alone.  When I heard You Give Love A Bad Name I knew I had to have it.  I have this album and Bounce, which is also quite good.  Pick up some Bon Jovi and rock the house!
B00008BXJG|5.0|This is the album that put the band on the map.  The synergy between Bon Scott's voice and the great guitar riffs has been often imitated but never duplicated from this album. <br /> <br />To top it off the band's mastery of the double entendre lyrics really hit its stride with this release. <br /> <br />This is a \\"desert island\\" must have, for those of you who wash ashore with a limited amount of music.
B000002HPV|5.0|I love what Bjork has done on this album.  I love her poetic goodness and sweet voice intermingled with modern electronica.  It works, it really does.  Bjork is like a fine wine.  Not everybody is going to like it, but if you do, you get it.  It becomes clear how good her music is.
B00005MM01|5.0|This is a special CD, wich can take you back to a time when music was easy, but not simple. Harmony, melody and lyrics straight from the heart. You can listen from track 1 to 10, and then from track 11 to end. The second part was called \\"For Little Ones\\", but you will take it as a gift for you even if you're very old, if you just still remember the days of flowers and gardens inside your heart. <br />A very special Donovan, a little folk, a little modern.
B000066NW0|5.0|I don't know what all the fuss is about with people calling her a poser and what not.  She is just doing her own thing, and making good music for us to enjoy so we should not complain.  I really like this album.  It was my intro to Avril aside from the radio.  It is definitely worth the money.
B00006JDVV|4.0|Rapid character and story development leads directly into action in this futuristic journey through hell on earth.  Dragon's fill the skies, feed on ash (that's a little odd), and...you guessed it...destroy everything on their way to total domination.  Enter our heros from many a story told before.  \\"A rag-tag army\\", \\"a cross section of mankind\\", etc.  Couple these struggling-to-survive men, women, and children hold up in an English castle with a very different type of Matthew McConaughey and his cross-Atlantic army and you get quite the battle royale. <br />Some slow spots for story lines and a predictable plot but a fun ride to the end.
B00001U03Q|5.0|Eric Clapton is such a talented and feeling musician and it shines through in his work.  Some of his music even brings a tear to my eye (Tears In Heaven) and evokes the sensitive guy in me.  Change The World really moves me.  The rest of the songs are really good too. Don't miss out on this album.  Get it!
B00008S2VG|3.0|I believe the main problem with this album is that the lyrics are really dull, perhaps with the exception of 'Easy Ride', 'Die Another Day' and 'Nothing Fails'. One would expect otherwise from 'the new Madonna' who is a 46 year-old mother of two big time Kabbalist who's had an incredible life. Most of the lyrics are just words that rhyme that you would expect from a 12 year old. I believe the aim here was to make a dance record with a message but that was done a zillion times better with 'Ray of Light'. Shortly, great vision, disappointingly executed.
B00000JQFM|5.0|Joe Satriani is such a talented guitarist and it shines through on this album.  There is never a dull moment.  He can slow it down a bit, but it is clear that this album is not a sleeper.  This might just be Joe Satriani's best work.  He takes you on an instrumental journey 10 tracks strong.  If you like electric guitar magic you must own this album.
B0000025YL|5.0|O.K., maybe i was a little harsh on Accept's 'Balls To The Wall' album, but this is a completely differant story. <br /> <br />'Restless And Wild' is the finest album from Accept, not overrated like 'Balls' is, this was probably as heavy as you could get in 82. The overall feeling of this album is very raw and heavy, yet at the same time melodic because of Wolf Hoffmann's classically influenced guitar chops. Even though the production is somewhat primative, the music more then makes up for it in sheer brutallity, i actually prefer the low qaulity production of this as opposed to the over-produced albums Accept would churn out latter in their career. This album gets a lot of credit for being one of the first \\"thrash\\" albums, this is mainly because of the first song \\"Fast As A Shark\\", which was one of the fastest tunes of that time period, infact, i don't think there was anything THIS fast or intense by ANY metal band back in the pre-Slayer days. Beyond that song you will find even better ones, like the crunchy title track and the frantic \\"Ahead Of The Pack\\". The song \\"Shake your Head\\" is average headbanging fair, but ending side-one is the fantastic \\"Neon Nights\\", it is my favorite Accept song of all time, very atmospheric and epic. Side-two starts with \\"Get Ready\\", a catchy little filler song that is all right, then comes \\"Deamon's Night\\" which is probably the most underrated Accept song ever written, it is just so effing heavy and agressive! \\"Flash Rocking Man\\" is an Accept staple and got played all of the time in their live sets. \\"Don't Go Stealing My Soul Away\\" is a attempt at the charts, i don't like it very much, sounds too much like AC/DC. The final song is \\"Princess Of The Dawn\\", it was meant to be a concept song and sounds like nothing else these guys have ever done, it is a great number but i wish the mixing engineer or whoever didn't abruptly cut the song off at the end, kinda ruins the qaulity of it. <br /> <br />I wish they countiued in the direction that this album displayed, it would of been great, instead of trying to become a Scorpions ripp-off band like what they did with their next two albums. I guess the success of the Scorpions became a role- modle for all of the german bands trying to make it big.       <br /> <br />
B00007KWHP|5.0|While the first two lps sparked interest in this curious band from the UK, it was the amazing Yes Album that confirmed everyone's suspicions about the influence they would have on the music world.  However, no one was prepared for \\"Fragile.\\"  Like many classic radio staples, \\"Roundabout\\" has lost its novelty through familiarity but when it first came out it shook up the whole radio landscape.  The ingenious format of including short individual pieces from each member was not new but it definitely put a stamp of uniqueness on the album.  But it is \\"Heart of the Sunrise\\" and \\"America\\" that continue to astound me.  The former is stunningly tight and dynamic.  The latter shows more than any other song in their arsenal that this was truly a top-notch rock and roll band.  The guitar solo section absolutely sizzles with playful energy and this song's inclusion on this reissue fits like a glove.  The rough mix of \\"Roundabout\\" is great because it really shows what a difference their producer Eddie Offord made in the final product.  While \\"Fragile\\" still doesn't reach the high level that CTTE would, it still stands as a landmark in prog rock history in that no one at that time could believe what they were hearing.
B00005JMJG|3.0|Joel and Clementine meet on a train after Joel decides on an impulse to skip work that day.  They're complete opposites - Joel quiet and melancholy, Clem a wild woman - but they fall for each other pretty fast.  Then one day Joel visits her at work and not only does she seem not to remember who he is, but she is involved with someone else whom Joel can't quite identify.  He later discovers that she has undergone a process to have him erased from her memory, and he decides to do the same.  But partway through he decides he doesn't want to lose his memories of her after all, so he attempts to bury them off the \\"map\\" where the erasure technicians can't find them. <br /> <br />A good portion of the film is spent following the two through Joel's memories, deeper and deeper as they try to escape deletion.  These surreal sequences go on too long and cause the film to drag at times (the childhood memories are particularly grating.)  But the movie's biggest flaw is a lack of substance.  Despite getting a direct look at some of Joel's defining moments, we never get a sense of him as a person.  Clementine is a complete enigma, and I couldn't figure out what the two of them saw in each other at all.  In the end, all we're left with is \\"boring\\" Joel and \\"wacky\\" Clementine.  There is a slight plot complication involving the hospital staff towards the end, but there isn't much to the story as a whole.  Overall, it's an interesting concept but one that mildly fails as a movie. <br /> <br />I didn't like the film enough to do much exploring of the special features, but I did see the rather lame music video (composed entirely of film clips with singing mouths superimposed over the characters) and a cheap-looking commercial for Lacuna, the company in the film.
B0000025DD|4.0|For the longest time, it was the only Pink Floyd solo album, not including Syd Barrett's departure from the band and reality via LSD, and it is a subdued and rather comfortably numb offering from prog guitar riff king, David Gilmour, with leanings towards blues guitar and flashes of Floydian space rock. \\"There's No Way Out Of Here\\", got all the radio airplay in 1978, a holy ghostfest goth-like FM radio favorite with impending organ, harmonica, and a female chorus torn between church and a 'Dark Side Of The Moon' recording session. Otherwheres there's a bit of routine and generic guitar filler, but \\"So Far Away\\", recalls Gilmour's early 'Umma-Gumma' era Floyd work, with piano driven lingering melody, and just enough guitar and downbeats to make it cool and spacey, and \\"Short And Sweet\\" sounds lifted from a blend of post-Beatles projects, notably Harrison's \\"What Is Life?\\", and Starr's \\"It Don't Come Easy\\", poured into Gilmour's own question and answer session. It's a fine and nostalgic album, maybe exactly what you'd expect form Pink Floyd's super guitarist, given the chance to be alone.
B0009HLDFU|1.0|While every corporation/radio station/(insert organization here) is giving away Ipods & Mp3 players, Foo Fighters' record label decides that in order to cut down on piracy, they will prevent us (buying customers) from being able to download this cd into our music libraries. The old phrase above comes to mind. <br /> <br />Luckily I haven't opened the CD yet and I damn well plan to return it.  Not to make a statement but simply because I consider music 75% pointless if I can't listen to it on my portable audio. <br />IDIOTS!
B0009KQOCO|5.0|When I first seen Short Circuit on Amazon, I couldn't wait for it to come out. I checked all the stores and couldn't find it,  so I came back to Amazon and bought it automatically. When I got in the mail, I immediately popped it in my psp and relived a great movie which I hadn't seen in gotta be fifteen years. But anyway great movie all the way. The only knock is the umd itself, they coulda put a whole lot more emphasis on the load screen.All you get is the title Short Circuit on a grey background. You put in Spiderman you get scenes from the movie backed by an orchestra.Maybe it's just me or just because the movies are twenty years apart. Either way the movie still is great. Who's Johnnie she says. CLASSIC
B0001I55OC|4.0|This movie is great. I enjoy it because I am 1) a history buff 2) a Gerard Butler fan and 3) I like the entertainment level. This movie looks corny from the previews but it is worth seeing it just to be entertained for two hours.
B0009AM5JA|5.0|This cd is absolutely, 100 percent, completely and totally fabulous. Coldplay did a fanatstic job both with the lyrics and music. Standout tracks are &quot;White Shadows&quot;, &quot;Fix You&quot;, &quot;Low&quot;, and &quot;Swallowed In The Sea&quot;. I just saw them in concert in Toronto and they were positively amazing! An outstanding third effort. The whole copy guarded deal was a waste, though.
0060955775|4.0|This was a very interesting book to read. I kept thinking what I would do if I had no more than a week left to live and I found that many ideas came into my mind. Some ideas were crazy and most were fun, which made me like the book better. You see, like Veronika, we will always be more interested in making the best out of our lives if we had an appointment with the end of it. <br />I don't think I'm fond of all she did and I certainly would do things differently, but the point is that I would do things I might not consider doing if I thought I had more time to live. Veronika found out she was going to die and instead of imprisoning her, that knowledge set her free. That is one good feeling! The idea of being set free by knowing you are going to die soon never crossed my mind before. People usually think that if someone knew they were going to die they would most likely be depressed and shut off from the rest of the world. But in the book this was not the case. Varonika did not think of the day she will die but of the few precious days between. I think many people would be happier if they thought this way!
0385510454|5.0|A good story and most enjoyable \\"vacation\\" book.  I am recommending it to my friends...
078693123X|4.0|There are really two main characters in this book, the first character is Drow culture, the second character is Menzoberranzen. The actual flesh and blood characters are there to exposit the features of the culture and the city. <br /> <br />   Though the story is fairly decent, the action scenes are well done and the purported main character Drizzt himself is sympathetic, though to my mind far too naive, the novel is more important as being the influence and foundation for how Dark Elves are viewed and used in fiction, particularly TSR fiction. <br /> <br />   The culture Salvatore more or less created is rich with detail and story potential. The houses, acadamies and religion of the drow are like early empire Rome, or a Victorian British society viewed through a dark mirror in Hades. With political, magical and armed warfare permitted and sanctioned by their goddess conflict is rife in the setting allowing many stories to flow.
B00008NRL8|5.0|I first heard a track on the movie \\"The Truth About Charlie\\". I have since heard tracks from this album on \\"Sex and The City\\" and others. I bought it and fell in love with it. <br />Very cool, loungy, sexy, and intoxicating.  A must buy if you are an international music lover, or just enjoy good lounge music if you are having friends over for a wine tasting, dinner, or a romantic evening. Great CD!
0066620996|5.0|This book does a great job of presenting information not found in lots of other books on business. The reason for this is because Jim Gibbons and his research team actually went out and collected data and then wrote this book based off facts. The book is excellent I highly recommend it :). Thanks Jim!
B00092ZMDY|5.0|I have really enjoyed this 2 dvd collection. As a fan of the Eagles in the 70's and 80's I believe they are better than ever. The harmonies and instrumentals are clear and crisp. It is obvious that the band is having a real good time. I would recommend adding this Tour to your collection and encouraging my friends to do so.
0689835604|5.0|This book offers a wonderful means to get your child to focus on reading. My son lifts up the flaps on each page while I read the text. He absolutely loves being able to interact with the book while we read. I highly recommend this product.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I love this CD!  Every song is great and I've listened to this CD over and over and over again without getting tired of it. <br /> <br />Get listening for anyone who enjoys Rock N'Roll.
B00097A5HW|5.0|Even though I was a little put off by her first single \\"La Tortura\\" and feared her selling out to new reggeaton fad, like every other performer in Latin America I decided to give this a try, and was somewhat shocked and completely pleased.  I won't call this her masterpiece until I listen to the second upcoming album, but this is really quite amazing. <br />Shakira's Fijacion Oral is a profound exploration on life, love, anger and pop.  Her vocals are as beautiful as ever, her lyrics are more poetic, deeper, and much more refined than her past efforts. I am also amazed at how melancholic this album is.  Seldom do latin artist made sad records, for fear of losing public and this is exactly what it is.  I wouldn't be surprised if younger audiences who jumped on this album for \\"la tortura\\" would completely ignore the rest of the songs. <br />Expect slow to mid tempo'ed songs, some electronic elements a la \\"Si\\" by Julieta Venegas.   There are references to Britpop, Streisand, chessy 70's pop rock, french pop rock (Emilie Simons), and some synth/goth pop (\\"lo imprescindible'), and maybe a little New Wave (Escondite Ingles).  Gustavo Cerati's collaboration can be felt in the chorus of Un Dia Especial (if you've never heard Gustavo Cerati, check out his solo and Soda Stereo work) and track \\"No\\" is moving enough in melody and lyrics to bring anyone to tears. <br />The production on this is also amazing, even though songs vary greatly in style it manages to sound cohesive and fluid (unlike Madonna's Bedtime Stories).  <br />Not only does Shakira prove she's not trying to be Britney but that actually has a vast musical language and that she feels comfortable in any music style, but that she is a real artist that still has much much more to sing about, and even more importantly, that we will want to listen to what she sings. <br /> <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is the best sci-fi TV series I have ever seen on any channel, it has it all. Great storyline, great acting, drama, humor, action, etc. I can't begin to tell you how angry I was with Fox for cancelling it in the first season, what a bunch of morons. They have the best sci-fi show ever and then they cancel it, genius! Well the Sci-Fi channel is showing the series right now if you can't get the DVD and the movie will be out soon (can't wait for that!)
B0002KVUKM|5.0|I like horror movies in general and this one was a pleasant change from the dark side of these kinds of movies.  I liked the sense of humor in the character of the friar, and call me \\"square\\" but I liked the lack of sex and foul language that dominates alot of otherwise good horror flicks these days.
0385338686|4.0|I absolutely love Sophie Kinsella and I have read all of her books, after reading Shopaholic and Sister, I was a bit disappointed by some of the far fetched things Becky went through, and I when I began The Undomestic Goddess, I had thought I was going to feel the same way about this book.  When Samantha picks up and leaves her life because of one mistake she has made, I was thinking oh no here we go again.  But I am happy to say the book turned around.  Throughout the book I was always thinking how can you just leave your life and not return to your apartment, but Samantha is great.  The love interest, Nat, is great also.  He is just a regular guy, he's not over the top like many male characters are in chick-lit books.  It made me laugh at many points and I wanted to know what was going to happen next.  The only thing I am hoping is that Sophie decides to write a sequel because I am dying to know what was in the letter Nat wrote to Samantha.
078322737X|5.0|I HAVE WATCHED THIS MOVIE SEVERAL TIMES AND I CONTINUE <br />TO ENJOY IT EVERY TIME. MY 14 YEAR OLD NEICE LOVED IT. <br />THIS IS A GREAT MOVIE TO BUY. THERE ARE A LOT OF GOOD <br />ACTORS IN THE MOVIE. A GREAT MOVIE OF THE 50'S AND 60'S.
B0000000LI|2.0|Yanni has undenyable talent and there is skillful musicianship throughout. This doesn't change the fact that LIVE AT THE ACROPOLIS is some of the cheesiest, most syrup-y music I've ever been subjected to. Yawn-i lives up to his name - this is boring.
B00026WU9Q|5.0|I was skeptical when the remastered Dylan CDs hit the shelves a year ago.  I asked myself, CBS/Columbia/Sony/Bob wants me to buy his CDs all over again  on top of his vinyl/cassettes?  True, some remasters shine: Layla by Derek &amp; The Dominoes, The Beatles Yellow Submarine Songbook CD, the Zeppelin catalogue.  However, others are cynical cash grabs that offer minimal improvement in sound (namely, the Stones reissues).  Only after a year did I finally try one of the Bob remasters, one of my favourites, Bringing It All Back Home.<br />The verdict?  Excellent.<br />Every track gains from remastering.  Each song rings with warmth and detail.  In the original 1990 CD issue, the instruments are lumped into one muddy, joyless mass of sound.  Here, the lead guitar, bass, organ and drums speak are distinct.  You can hear actually hear each instrument, each guitar lick, each drumbeat, each bass pattern and keyboard note.  When blended together into a simple, but exciting mix, the instruments mesh perfectly with Bobs vocals.  In other words, the songs rock.<br />Thats clear from the opening notes of Subterranean Homesick Blues to the blues raunch of Outlaw Blues and Dada juggernaut of Bob Dylans 15th Dream.  The improved sound is also evident on the sublime love songs, She Belongs To Me and Love Minus Zero/No Limit which flow with a newfound grace.<br />The remastering has wiped the grime off of Dylans vocals which are now are pungent and warm throughout, especially on the acoustic B-side starting with Mr. Tambourine Man. <br />Its a cliché, but Dylan has never sounded so good.  It used to be chore to listen to the heavily compressed, flat Dylan CDs from the 90s, but now this music is a pleasure, whether on speakers or headphones.<br />Even the cover is sharper and more colourful than its predecessor.  The booklet is more generous, but it shamefully omits the names of Dylans session players, the men who helped Dylan go electric and revolutionize rock music.  (If anyone from Sony is reading this, why?)<br />My only caveat is to buy these CDs at a good price.  Its fair to say that most customers of these reissues already own the original CDs and shouldnt pay more than say $11 (Canadian) per disc.  At that rate, Ill buy them all.
B000002HH9|4.0|First, a little overview of my background: I'm a fairly old-school fan. When I first got into the Cure, I was in 10th grade and I became absolutely mesmerized with THE HEAD ON THE DOOR when it was released. The Cure opened the door to a whole new world for me, an alternative universe far removed from the classic rock on the radio, one that really spoke to me. I was about as big a fan as you could get without emulating Robert Smith's hair and make-up and following them on tour. I did see them in Dallas on the KISS ME tour and had a blast. I saw them again in Washington D.C. on the WISH tour and they were, incredibly, even better.<br /><br />But by the time WILD MOOD SWINGS came out, I had moved on to different bands and different kinds of music (as is my want). I recall, after hearing \\"Mint Car\\" a few times and sampling a few songs from the album, I decided not to catch the latest Cure wave, as I was getting into groups like 311 instead (I still especially dig 311's first two albums which are much cooler than what you might've caught on the radio).<br /><br />I never stopped loving the Cure though, and more recently I snatched up their JOIN THE DOTS box set (see my review, if you so choose). Among other revelations, it filled in some blank spaces I had left behind and I became particularly enamored of \\"This is a Lie\\" - a very meaningful song to me lyrically and one of the best tracks on disk 4 of JOIN THE DOTS. So I decided to trace back to the one album in the Cure's catalog I had skipped which features the original \\"This is a Lie.\\" Here are my own, personal, impressions of WILD MOOD SWINGS:<br /><br />\\"Want\\" - a tremolo-laden guitar kicks off this opening track which explores one of Robert Smith's major themes: everything is temporary, nothing on earth can satisfy permanently. (note to the uninitiated - Robert Smith IS the Cure). A good song with some good orchestration if somewhat generic Cure. ***1/2<br /><br />\\"Club America\\" - seems to describe European clubs more than American ones (I actually lived in Europe for a year), but anyway, it's a biting take on poseurs and the club scene in general - \\" . . . living a fabulous lie . . . in Club America tonight.\\" I think the guitar riff is pretty infectious. ****<br /><br />\\"This is a Lie\\" - I thought the JOIN THE DOTS version was a unique orchestral cut, but this version is virtually the same. Sad and beautiful. It's basically saying that the belief systems people invest their lives in are just illusions that have been created by other people. Why should I, for example, subscribe to one particular belief system and assume everyone who believes differently will roast forever in a burning lake? *****+<br /><br />\\"The 13th\\" - a quasi-salsa-flavored track with nice horns and percussion. Sweet and easy until the \\"And it feels GOOOOOD!\\" chorus kicks in with panache. Though far from my personal favorite, this is another worthy excursion into yet another musical field by Robert Smith and co. This band has touched on all sorts of musical styles, from jazz to heavy metal. I didn't like this one much at first but I've since warmed up to it. ****<br /><br />\\"Strange Attraction\\" - I really admire the Cure for, among other things, their ability to go to extremes. They have made some of the darkest, most gorgeously bleak music ever and conversely some of the happiest, most celebratory ever. \\"Strange Attraction\\" is a good song, decidedly on the \\"happy\\" side of the fence (although it has an undercurrent of melancholy in classic Cure fashion). Still, it's a bit too chirpy for my tastes. Repeated listens have enabled me to appreciate it to an extent. ***<br /><br />\\"Mint Car\\" - another good song with some cool guitar, but it doesn't turn me on much personally. Like \\"Strange Attraction,\\" it has a certain juvenile quality that makes me think it should be part of a children's show or something (incidentally, \\"Just Like Heaven\\" was in fact used for a French children's show). Don't get me wrong, I loveCure pop songs like \\"Friday I'm in Love,\\" I just don't care for this one much. ***<br /><br />\\"Jupiter Crash\\" - good lyrically, this is classic unrequited-love Cure. A good song if not particularly remarkable musically. ***1/2<br /><br />\\"Round & Round & Round\\" - another pretty good pop song, but sadly, like a bit too much of this album, it sounds a little too much like what has become \\"generic Cure.\\" ***<br /><br />\\"Gone!\\" - they change it up again with this loping, sort of Latin-jazz number. I love the lurching rhythm and the message is spot-on and one that I need to hear often (\\"get up, get out and get gone!\\"). ****1/2<br /><br />\\"Numb\\" - another aching Cure song about addiction (\\"he's in love with a drug\\"). Great violin solo. Smith's vocals sound great (that is, if you like the sound of his voice to begin with). Good song. ****<br /><br />\\"Return\\" - pumped up with horns and dizzy keyboards, this one still falls limp in my mind. **1/2<br /><br />\\"Trap\\" - solid rock song. Smith's guitar sounds great, but he's perfected a certain sound that he likes and in the process has lost some of the freshness he once had. ****<br /><br />\\"Treasure\\" - a sweet, melancholy tune with plaintive violin and other first-rate Cure touches on guitar, piano and percussion. *****<br /><br />\\"Bare\\" - another melancholy song, \\"Bare\\" is beautiful and sophisticated. While the Cure sound almost child-like on some of these tracks, they sound very mature here, playing gorgeous chords and taking the song in several different directions. *****<br /><br />As I suspected previously, this is one of the Cure's weakest albums overall, but I was pleasantly surprised to find some real gems here. While I might've given it three stars previously, my tally averages out to four stars, so that's what I'm rating it. Three stars may be a more accurate rating in relation to their other, better albums, so take note of the obvious fan bias on display here! For a band that specializes in wild mood swings, these aren't their wildest but there's definitely some good stuff here. If you're new to the Cure, I'd suggest getting STARING AT THE SEA first, unless you're looking for some classic goth/depressing music, in which case you'll want to get PORNOGRAPHY or DISINTEGRATION.Cure pop songs like \\"Friday I'm in Love,\\" I just don't care for this one much. ***<br /><br />\\"Jupiter Crash\\" - good lyrically, this is classic unrequited-love Cure.

B0006GAOBI|4.0|\\"28 days. 6 hours. 42 minutes. 12 seconds. That is when the world will end.\\" Or so says Frank, the pshcyotic bunny rabbit that tells Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) to do violent things.  <br /> <br />If you're buying the director's cut, then you've probably already seen this movie about 28 times. If you haven't, let me fill you in.  <br /> <br />In 1988 suburban Middlesex, Donnie Darko lives with his loving family in an ordinary life. But one night he sleepwalks towards Frank where he recieves information about the world's end, and in the process dodges death when a jet engine falls on his room (you heard me right-a jet engine). Because Frank saved his life, Donnie now must do what Frank tells him to do. Given this time until the world ends, Donnie tries to make sense of what has happened to him, as well as connect with his family, fall for a girl, and question the search for God, and in the process discovers that he should've died when the jet engine fell on his room. <br /> <br />The main reason why Donnie Darko is already a cult classic at age 4 is because it doesn't clearly offer a solution, leaving the viewer in the dark as to figure out the pretzel-like remains. But that's also why people love it. I honestly loved it because it unknowlingly re-examins what it means to live; If the world were to really end in 28 days, what would YOU do? <br /> <br />With an impressive cast (Drew Barrymore and Patrick Swayze have supporting roles), lots of satirical humor, and many questions to ask, Donnie Darko remains a wonderful movie that dares to be original and will leave you thinking and wondering long after the credits end.  <br /> <br />But the only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is for the director's cut and the special features. In the Director's Cut Edition, the movie is clogged with excerps from 'The Philosophy of Time Travel', a fictional book prominatly featured in the film. It didn't even really achieve what it meant to-offer a clearer answer to the film's twisty plot. They belong in the special features department, like the original DVD did. And the sound and visual affects added in completly ruin it, such as the sci-fi like sound affects in the opening credits-they were NOT needed and were better without it; It seemed like Richard Kelly took too many notes from 'E.T.' while cutting the film. And the topper comes at the montage/letter to Roberta Sparrow, a powerful intro to the famously poignant 'Mad World' sequence. The director decided to add of all things FIREWORKS. WHY FIREWORKS? They are a total distraction to the beautiful montage and are not needed at all.  <br /> <br />The special features are another story (actually, the same). The original DVD had an insightful commentary by star Jake Gyllenhaal and writer/director Richard Kelly (the much cluttered remaining cast and crew commentary could've been skipped), while this one features Richard Kelly and his friend Kevin Smith. This commentary doesn't say much about the actual movie, but rather sounds more like a conversation between two buddies over coffee and cigarettes. Vastly un-needed is the documentary about British people who loved the movie, as well as the short movie about the #1 Donnie Darko fan-it's more sad and disturbing (in the fact that someone actually loves any movie THAT MUCH) than funny. The least boring is the production diary with commentary by the cinematographer. <br /> <br />If you haven't seen this movie, I strongly advise you to rent the regular DVD, form an opinion, then, if and only if you really loved the original movie, shimmy on down to the video rental store (or wait a day for your Netflix DVD to come in the mail) and watch this. While it isn't entirely a must-skip, only huge followers of the original will truly appreciate this.
B000667FN8|4.0|The first song I heard from this album was 'Shut Up'. Then I heard 'Untitled' on TRL. I thought both of these songs were pretty good, so I listened to some of the other tracks on a website, and ended up buying the album. When I got the album, I instantly put in my cd player and listened to some of the songs. I was most impressed with 'Shut Up', 'Welcome to my Life', 'Perfect World', 'Me Against the World', and 'Untitled'. after just one listen of 'Shut Up', you'll know that these guys are one of those punk bands that like to jump up and down and scream alot. 'Welcome to my Life' is probably the best song on the album, barely beating 'Perfect World'. 'Untitled' is a truly touching tear jerker dealing with the horrors of drunk-driving. It may even make you cry. Uhh... I didn't, of course. The reason I gave this album four stars is that the music is great, but they need to work on their voices. They sound like a northern pop band trying to sing rock. Now I know that's sort of what punk is about, but they need to decide whether their pop or rock. They fall into the category where the band isn't sure, so they play songs in both genres. other bands in this category include Hoobastank, Yellowcard, and Sum 41 ( I don't care what you say, Hoobastank aren't fully rock.) Hopefully Simple Plan will decide which they want to be soon, though I never plan to see them as rockers as good as Papa Roach, Green Day, and the extremely underplayed Breaking Benjamin. If you like rock, pop,or punk, I'd buy this album.
B0009W5JS2|1.0|First of all, this movie had nothing to do with XXX. Ice Cube was XXX by name only. He wasn't much of an action hero or extreme sports expert. Also, have any of you ever seen a worse actor than that guy who played Ice Cube's sidekick. I couldn't believe it. Lastly,the effects were awful. When the car was chasing the train at the end it seemed like i was watching a video game. Just terrible movie, and i did like the first.
B0009HLDFU|1.0|Not only does is this CD not compatible with ipods, but I have had all kinds of problems playing this CD on my computer because of the copy protection.  If you intend to use this CD on an ipod or computer, don't bother buying it. <br /> <br />I am a long time Foo fan and I'm very disappointed with this CD.  Had I known about the copy protection in advance I would never have purchased it since for me it was a waste of money.
6305327084|2.0|I wanted to like this movie, but it was so saturated with Hollywood fakery - artificial dialog, arch & trite movie-style wisdom, forced plot-twists - that simply watching it seemed impossible.  Timothy Hutton is Willie - the first of a group of men we'll meet who inhabit a small town in a quiet and snowy part of America.  Willie is a small-time, New York City area musician who cleans out the tip-glass and heads home for a reunion.  He's made little impact on NYC, though we can pretty much guess why he left home.  When he gets back, he hooks up with his old buds who (this being a Hollywood movie) have aged without ever maturing.  The guys include Matt Dillon and Michael Rapaport, both exhibiting serious problems relating to women.  Surrounding the men are their smarter halves - women who are also unable to mature despite being much smarter than their men.  Between the two groups are Marty (Natalie Portman) and Gina (Rosie O'Donnell) - each of whom are meant to be as wise as they are unconnected to men. (Portman looks to be about 15 in this movie - to young to have a relationship with Will, but not too young to immediately engage him in unbelievably arch dialog;  Rosie O'Donnell's character is simply too annoying to have a relationship with anybody.)      Not much happens in this movie - which never becomes more than a loosely connected stream of scenes in which wise women try to get their dim boyfriends to grow-up and grow past their outdated ideas about women.  Though set in Smalltown, USA, the script is full of the sort of dialog you'd expect to here in some Screenwriter's Writing Workshop:  \\"I can't play Pooh to your Christopher Robin\\", Will says; Marty has an even more arch line - \\"If I'm not mistaken, you've come back here to the house of loneliness and tears, to Daddy Downer and Brother Bummer, to come to some sort of decision about life, a life decision if you will.\\" - which would have sounded bad enough if her character wasn't high-school aged;  The chief indignity is heaped on Michael Rappaport's character, who must explain his open adoration of supermodels - \\"A beautiful girl can make you dizzy, like you've been drinking Jack and Coke all morning. She can make you feel high full of the single greatest commodity known to man - promise. Promise of a better day\\" but sadly not a better movie.  Does that kind of dialog exist anywhere outside of a Hollywood movie?  (Will, who's stuck on the receiving end of Paul's wisdom, quips about checking Paul's refrigerator for human heads, laughing at Paul while accepting the idea that men like him actually exist, and of course laughing at anybody who buys into those ideas as well, even if they wouldn't have known of them without seeing this movie.)      Ironically, \\"Beautiful\\" is so wedded to the idea that men don't know real beauty when they see it, that it falls back on familiar faces to play the small-town sweethearts - Mira Sorvino, Uma Thurman, Annabeth Gish and Portman.  \\"Beautiful\\" pokes fun at men who ignore real women because they're obsessed with beautiful women, then casts some of those beautiful women to play the ones the men are ignoring.  Nothing in \\"Beautiful\\" is all that insightful or funny, and bery little of it actually reaches to the level of being \\"pretty\\".
B000021XS0|5.0|What is there to say about this album that hasn't already been said?  Well, probably the fact that this may be the best CD of all times has not been highlighted enough.  Each track has its own importance to the disc and is interesting enough to be listened to an infinite number of times.  Although the band is on occassion chastised severely for noodling too much and losing some of the emotion, the story line of the album allows certain moments in the disc (like \\"The Spirit Carries On\\") to achieve the peak of emotional intensity.  Of course many solos are heard over the course of the nearly 80 minute epic, but they are all so memorable and so mind-boggling that people more used to 4 minute, predictable songs should, given time, come to adore these passages of musical greatness.<br /><br />If you have ears, I suggest you grace them with this album immediately.  If not, then I guess you're out of luck.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|This boxset is Awesome.  It has 9 discs.  It has two versions of each of the Alien films.  The 9th disc is the special features discs full of anything an Alien fan would want to know and explore.  It is one of the best box sets I have ever bought.
B0002NRRAG|5.0|I bought this CD after reading a review of a live performance given by Madeleine Peyroux in L.A.  She has a gorgeous voice -- smoky, silky, rich, and haunting.  The songs -- some new, some standards -- are wonderful.  The opening track, \\"Dance Me to the End of Love\\"  is terrific.

B00003CX9E|5.0|If you have seen only the movie, \\"Citizen Kane\\", you have seen half a story at best. Like no other, the story behind the story is as powerful as the movie itself. Without it, this would be just another great old story, well told, high tech for its time and within budget.     From this two-disc set, we see a clash of two powerful men, William Randolph Hearst and Orson Welles, each following his own misguided path. We see two great ironies. At a young age, Orson Welles knew the value of a good controversy - in show business, there is no such thing as bad publicity and all that. Of course, controversy killed \\"Citizen Kane\\" commercially. To William Randolph Hearst, \\"Citizen Kane\\" has to be destroyed. It wasn't. It became perhaps what the great Mr. Hearst is best known for.     This controversy raged in a time when America started losing its innocence. A time when all doctors, ministers and the Fourth Estate (to name only three) were not questioned as they are today.     Rosebud was the intended irony. The word Rosebud meant everything in the story and it meant nothing. It was a storytelling device. But what did Rosebud mean to William Randolph Hearst? Well, I'm not going to spoil the surprise except to say that it meant Hearst tried to have a sense of humor. Of course, he didn't. A sense of humor was one of the few things he couldn't afford. If he had only found humor in the parallels to his life, he would have been in a better mood to see that some of the story had nothing to do with him. It's fiction, for crying out loud! A wiser man would have laughed it off. A smarter man would have hired the primary screenwriter, Herman Mankiewicz, to write an authorized biography, which would have neutralized the bad publicity. However, Hearst wasn't built that way. Winning wasn't as important as crushing his opposition.    Experts say this is the greatest screenplay ever written. I agree. Experts say this is the greatest movie of all time. It is certainly one of the greatest butobjectively, there is no greatest single film of all time. \\"Citizen Kane\\" is in my top 20 somewhere.    I have a single negative comment. My player may well be the problem but this DVD \\"skipped and slipped\\" on me. I found a \\"solution.\\" I took a couple of intermissions, which allowed the hot DVD to cool then all was well again. At least I hope it is as simple as that.    If you enjoy old movies, you must have this set.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|My teenage children and I love this movie.  It is a \\"family favorite.\\"  The story, the music, and the cast are superb.  It twists normal day-to-day life together with unexplainable phenomenon.  Is Donnie Darko crazy?  Or is this really happening to him?
B0007Y08IS|5.0|This is one of the funniest movies i've ever seen in my whole life!
B00007E8V4|5.0|This album is just as good as Toxicity, if not better. <br />My favorite song on the album is \\"A.D.D.\\". <br />Excellent song with a political message. <br />The other 15 songs are also very good & unique in their own way. <br />\\"Mr. Jack\\", \\"Boom\\", \\"Nuguns\\", \\"Thetawaves\\" were all memorable and got stuck in my head. <br />If your a SOAD fan, then this is a must have in your collection. <br />
B00003CX8V|5.0|\\"The Apartment\\" is the model of the kind of movie they don't make anymore, not even Cameron Crowe, who took his inspiration for the excellent \\"Jerry Maguire\\" from this movie. Brimming with incredible (and incredibly real) dialogue, unobtrusive but picture-perfect direction, and outstanding performances, \\"The Apartment\\" defined the sophisticated-urban-romantic-comedy genre that later gave birth to such classic creations as \\"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\\" and \\"Sex and the City\\". There were funny stories about living in the big city before but they were never so well told, never so packed with humanity, and never so out-and-out FUNNY. Billy Wilder may be known for his acid-tongued humor about people stabbing each other in the back, but what makes \\"The Apartment\\" great is not its vitriol but the humanity of its two main characters, both of whom Wilder clearly cared about very much. I've never seen the ending as a cop-out, as many critics who relish Wilder's notoriously black humor have called it. This is a love story, folks; if you want a story that ends badly with two people who can't stand each other, look at real life. That's why we started writing stories in the first place, because life never goes where it would if we were in charge. <br /> <br />On a personal note, I'd just like to add that this movie actually saved my life. Many years ago a woman I loved left me one week before Christmas, taking all the furniture with her, leaving me only a chair, the TV and VCR, and a bare Christmas tree. Rather than kill myself like I wanted to, I watched \\"The Apartment\\" over and over, and seeing the similarly lonely C.C. Baxter gradually work things out gave me hope until I could do it for myself. I recommend this movie not just because it's a great movie, put together by artists at the top of their game, but because there is a spark of Life in it that survives, 45 years later, untouched and unfaded.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|System of a Down is still as good as they ever were! <br />Their songs are still original & varied. <br />I like the fact that Daron adds more to the vocals in this album. <br /> <br />All of the songs on this album are great in my opinion, except for \\"Old School Hollywood.\\" <br />That particular song isn't very strong lyrically & it's slightly on the annoying side. <br />The only other negative would be that this album is on the short side, with only 11 songs. <br /> <br />But thankfully, the songs are very good and will be stuck in your head for days. <br />\\"Violent Pornography\\", \\"Sad Statue\\" and \\"BYOB\\" were my favorite songs from this album. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|I love this album. A collection of all her \\"Greatest Hits\\". I love her new songs on there and the fact that she recorded Party For Two with two diffrent duet partners so we can choose which one we like better. If you like Country pop then this is a CD for you.

B000069HK2|5.0|I actually listened to In Love and Death, The Used's second album, first. Unquestionably, though, the self-titled album is far better.<br /><br />The lyrics hold wordplay, changing some lines of common phrases, such as in \\"Poetic Tragedy\\" (The cup is not half empty as pessimists say/as far as he sees nothing's left in the cup) or \\"Buried Myself Alive\\" (If you want me back/You're gonna have to ask/Nicer than that), both of which being the album's best tracks.<br /><br />The Used's vocalist, Bert McCracken has an excellent voice that screams better than most, and even when Bert's screaming reaches it's most insane point (in the hidden track \\"Choke Me\\"), it still holds its own pitch. Bert's singing voice isn't amazing or haunting or anything like that, however he still does a very well job in the softer songs like \\"Poetic Tragedy\\", \\"Blue and Yellow\\" and \\"On My Own\\". \\"Blue and Yellow\\" in particular shows how softly Bert is capable of singing, although he simply chooses not to.<br /><br />No song on the album is overshadowed by the others; you will not find yourself only listening to the first half of the album. The placement was done well, balancing out the energetic songs with lots of screaming (\\"Maybe Memories\\", \\"Box Full of Sharp Objects\\") with softer songs (\\"Blue and Yellow\\", \\"Poetic Tragedy\\"), keeping the listener from expecting only a certain style.<br /><br />My favorite song is \\"Poetic Tragedy\\", written in the third person, something a little more rare in music save for a few songs. It also is about suicide.<br /><br />The only thing that bothers me is that after many songs, you hear random pointless noise that easily could've been taken out, as it really kills the mood. For example, in \\"Poetic Tragedy\\", Bert's agonized screams of \\"and he takes... he takes... his life...\\" are followed by violins, then a second of silence, then a bunch of golfers talking about getting a hole-in-one. The same can be said for \\"Buried Myself Alive\\", which ends with some screeching noise that is just loud and annoying.<br /><br />The album ends with the powerful \\"Pieces Mended\\", which combines Bert's screaming and singing better than any other track does, save pehaps for \\"Buried Myself Alive\\". However, my favorite part of the track is the song that comes after four minutes of silence at the end of \\"Pieces Mended\\", \\"Choke Me\\". It begins with someone saying demented rhymes to Bert, who I will simply refer to as The British Lady, and the song itself is entirely screamed, with a few seconds of spoken lyrics.<br /><br />In the end, this is one of my favorite albums, and I've been able to listen to it almost daily for about three months now without getting tired of any of the songs.<br /><br />Best Tracks:<br /><br />Poetic Tragedy<br /><br />Buried Myself Alive<br /><br />Pieces Mended/Choke Me<br /><br />Maybe Memories<br /><br />Blue and Yellowreeching noise that is just loud and annoying. <br /> <br />The album ends with the powerful \\"Pieces Mended\\", which combines Bert's screaming and singing better than any other track does, save pehaps for \\"Buried Myself Alive\\".

B00000DD1S|5.0|\\"Live in Greenwich Village: The Complete Impulse! Recordings\\" brings together two Albert Ayler LPs, \\"Albert Ayler in Greenwich Village\\" and the posthumous \\"The Village Concerts\\", together with a track released on a compilation and one unreleased piece, all recorded in Greenwich Village in Manhattan between 1965 and 1967.  Ayler by this point had totally codefied his music, and was still outside of any commercial influence, and the performances are nothing short of astounding. <br /> <br />These recordings find Ayler surrounded by sympathetic musicians, including his brother Don on trumpet, who totally believe in what he's doing-- the music is largely familiar sounding march themes played in harmony and unison by the two horns, supported more often than not by strings, with drumming abandoning timekeeping and instead coloring the music further.  Improvisation is fierce, with both Ayler's reachign far beyond themselves-- their playing is clearly inspired.   Honestly, just about everything on here is nothing short of astonishing in its beauty and power.  Of particular note is \\"Truth is Marching In\\" from the first disc-- swelling as Don states the theme and Ayler plays counter and harmony to him while Michel Samson lays full counterpoint on violin and the rhythm section explodes.  Also quite interesting is the piano and tenor duet \\"Angels\\" and \\"For John coltrane\\", again the only piece featuring Ayler on alto accompanied only by four strings. <br /> <br />The sound on these recordings is fantastic-- crisp, clear, and could have been recorded last year.  The liner notes include essays by Nat Hentoff and Robert Palmer written for the original LPs most of this material was released on. <br /> <br />If you're new to Ayler, this may be a good place to start, certainly the performance is brilliant throughout.  If you're not new to Ayler, you should probably have a copy of this, the material contained here is essential.
B00004RFFI|3.0|You can fast-forward through the inane dialog, or turn the sound down and make up your own, the tornados are the stars of this movie. Some of the best \\"special effect\\" tornados I've ever seen. If you like tornados (as I do) it's worth watching.
0380789019|5.0|I read a lot of books with varying degrees of enjoyment, but it's been a long time since I found one that was a pleasure. Neverwhere is one of the gems. Imaginative, well-written, good characters, good story. It became one of my favorites as soon as I read it. Definitely a plus if you like \\"coming of age\\" or \\"finding your true self\\" stories.
B00097A5I6|1.0|Well I'm afraid they've really lost it now. Plagiarism without thougt or even modification. A real bore.  <br /> <br />Harken the Art Brut instead much more entertaining!
B00005U122|5.0|I saw the show.  I bought the DVD. Of all the concert DVD's I have seen, this one is by far the best in terms of making you feel like you were there.  For Waters fans, Floyd fans, this is a no brainer.
0385513755|3.0|This is an Amazon first kind of review in the sense that I am reviewing another reader's review. I am referring to Mr. David C. Read. I enjoyed his thoughts on the Da Vinci code simply because we share the same reaction to Mr. Brown's book. It is a work of fiction and it is indeed frightening to find some people taking it seriously. Da Vinci code is a good read yes but it is as fulfilling as a piece of fluff to read while waiting for a root canal.<br /><br />Three stars.
1878424505|5.0|If each of us were to live by The Four Agreements life on earth would be heaven. In four simple statements, Ruiz summarizes keys to love and respect and oneness. Even if you don't but the somewhat mystically spiritual elements, the four agreements are worth reading, and worth living by.
B000003TA4|1.0|Anyone who says that Kurt Cobain was tortured wasn't alive in the 90's to see his babyish temper tantrums with audiences and his own bandmates. Nobody with millions of dollars has anything to whine about. Sure, he was an addict, but he lived/loved his junkie lifestyle all the way to the sporting goods store where he bought the shotgun he blew his face off with (don't you think that's THE perfect Aberdonian hillbilly suicide?). Cobain was a man (barely) who only cared about himself and making more money to get some tar. He couldn't even witness his own child's birth because he had overdosed on heroin and was being treated a few rooms away from his then in-labor wife. How can you idolize that? Teens can't relate to a bunch of slurred words about sniffing glue and loading up on guns. Unless, of course, the millions of kids who bought Nevermind enjoy destroying their brain cells and enjoy spending their time at the local shooting range.      For the love all music that's good, get REM's Murmur to see pure, raw emotion.
B0009HLDFU|2.0|I listened to a copy of this cd from a friend and found both discs to be amazing. I was all ready to buy it from amazon when I saw the reviews indicating the fact that this CD is copy protected in a manner that it wont work with my Ipod. Due to this fact I gave the CD a 2 star review. A CD that does not have the flexibility to allow me to listen to the music I purchased any way I want to is simply useless to me no matter how good the songs are. I simply will not spend my hard earn money on an item that will limit the way I want to use it after I have paid for it legally. I hope other artist, labels and websites get smart and stop this nonesense of trying to control the way customers want to enjoy music. Stop trying to blame us for the declining sales figures for the music Industry and start looking within the Music Industry itself. These are the type of decisions that continue to alienate customers year after year.
0380789035|5.0|This was a wonderful, wonderful novel.  I love fantasy & \\"good vs evil\\" themes and this book delivers that perfectly.  I don't want to give anything away, but this is a great story that tackes you across america with some very strange company.  Get ready to flip back the pages for character reference!!  So much stuff going on in this book.<br /><br />This inspired me to read all of Gaiman's other novels (well, the other two he wrote - Stardust & Neverwhere.  Both great!) and I wans't dissapointed.<br /><br />Very original, very fun.  Like my title says, I wish I could forget I read it, so I could experience it all over again..
B00070Q7VO|5.0|This music is reminiscent of days gone by.  The haunting sounds of \\"Home\\" to the jazzy music of Sinatra and Como.  It is a great addition to my CD collection.  With music the way it is today, this is very refreshing.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Watch Firefly. Buy the DVD. Then watch Serenity. Please! As usual, you entertainment execs as FOX underestimate the viewing audience and make decisions based on what YOU would like to see. Sadly, you rarely know what the public would appreciate. You good folks out there in the real world (not the MTV series or any hackneyed reality program pretending to be actual life), please watch this show. If you've never watched \\"Buffy,\\" or \\"Angel,\\" or even \\"Dark Angel\\" (good job on that again, FOX decision-makers!), just give this show a chance. See the first episode. If you're not drawn in by the plot, cast and overall magic -- not to mention the hauntingly lyrical theme song that opens the series -- I'll eat my hat!
0380002930|5.0|This book is typically billed as a children's classic, but I would recommend it for readers of any age who can appreciate epic adventure, deep and fascinating characters, and a true sense of suspense and conflict that is not easily come by. <br /> <br />Whenever a friend of mine is looking for reading recommendations, one the first things out of my mouth is, \\"Have you read Watership Down?\\"
0689878451|5.0|This cute story is the perfect way to teach any young child about sexual orientation.  Possibly the cutest way to help one's children to learn about open mindedness.
0812550706|5.0|Reviewers: Make sure you don't give away the ending! <br /> <br />This is the most exciting and emotionally enthralling sci-fi book I have ever read. You follow the young boy-genius, Ender, as he is being groomed to fight a war against an alien race. <br /> <br />This isn't just a story about war; it's a story about being a boy, a freak of sorts because of his intelligence, being pushed through a hostile system where weakness is despised, and losers are dealt with harshly. It's about trying to make friends where friendship is not tolerated, and destroying your opponent is the only thing that brings praise. <br /> <br />Ender's just a kid, but he's expected to save the human race. Great book for any genre.
B00008OWZC|5.0|Reviews...So ok. Briefly:  The average person would be fine in making the assumption that the typical cdnow/amazon.com review is written with the simple purpose of either pursuading you to buy (or not) a product. Because the writer already knows what it is they are purchasing (the pros and cons), I think it's fair to say they write to share their opinion in order to help you.  Well this time, this one is different.  As is the case with any type of research, sometimes sources aren't credible. They shouldn't be used as a reliable means of information. For example, in a supposedly \\"objective\\" review, one particular individual claimed the $30 for this record is not worth it, when mere sentences earlier he also advised you to skip one of the most amazing forms of recorded self expression and percussion expertise ever laid down on a main stream record: the track otherwise known as Moby Dick.  For me, this song was one of the DEFINITE reasons for buying this cd. For 18 minutes, we as a listener....as a lover of music....get to experience a full fledged assault utilizing rhythmic improvisation (the moby dick version on the dvd is much different), drum precision, and musical talent altogether. At the end of the day, the fact remains that it doesn't matter WHO it is. The point isn't who did it, but rather...it was done. And amazingly so.  So while he may say \\"don't listen to it, it's not worth it, blah blah blah\\", I say please....do NOT heed the advice dished out in something writen by someone who seems to be more interested in deviating from the majority opinion than providing a REAL \\"objective\\" opinion. If one was really serious in their effort to be objective about this track: you may not like it or love it, but you'll definitely appreciate it. It should definitely NOT be skipped.  That said - The best parts of this album are certainly the longer medlys and the solos. While it is evident that yes, Plant's vocals are touchy at some parts (due to the rigors of touring no doubt), and yes, Jones' bass is not fully appreciated (and yet, was it ever truly displayed fully?), The Stairway to Heaven on disk one is without a doubt the best version of the song I've ever heard. I can't listen to the studio version anymore. The live song simply puts it to shame. It's THAT good. IF there is one real draw back to this album, it is not necessarily a great listen unless you have time on you hands because of the length of some tracks (moby dick roughly 20 mins is followed by a whole lotta love medly of 23 mins).  However, to give this cd anything less than 5 stars is ludicrous. Not because it's Zeppelin. No. Because here we have 4 of the best individual musical talents in rock history in full expression, free from the some of the confines that can come with production intended for distibution- capturing the true energy of these songs with live performance...and with it, comes new interpretations of old rock classics. To deny the greatness of it, despite small flaws that are more due to descrepancy with personal preferences than anything else, is simply shameful.
B00005JNSK|1.0|I love, love, love Johnny Depp, so imagine my surprise when I went to this movie and could not stand it nor did I think it did Depp any justice. I just could not get over the fact that Depp looked and talked like Michael Jackson and believe it or not, I was not aware of this comparison before seeing the movie! I thought I was the only one seeing it that way. The parallels between this movie and Michael Jackson with his never never land ranch were to much for me to overcome and I hated the movie. The oompa's were ridiculous. I can sadly say that now I will never be able to say I loved Depp in EVERY movie I ever saw him in. This one just bites. Don't go see it, rent the video when you can get it for 1.99. I am curious to know what everyone else saw in the movie that made them rate it so highly. I must have missed something!
B0009HLDFU|1.0|It's disgusting that these millionaire musicians put copy-protection because they're afriad of loosing a few sales, so in order to do that they alienate all of us fans that own iPods. I have a mac, not windows media player and my computer won't even the read the cd let alone rip it, and also only 1 of the 3 other cd players in my house  will even read it. This is because these copy-protected CDs aren't even technically even CDs! So a lot of slightly older CD players won't play it! I paid $379cnd for my iPod and I cannot listed to the music I paid money for in the form I want!? That's sickening that these millionares are now even dictating the form in which we listen to their music.    And the CD isn't even good. I only gave the these guys 1star because I couldn't go lower. I won't buy music from Foo Fighters or anyone else that uses copy-protection again. What good is a CD that I can't listen to in my car or at the gym(the two places I primarily listen to music)?  You music industry communists disgust me.
B0000AFX64|5.0|This is the first \\"episode\\" (it was actually a mini-series that launched the TV show) of Battlestar Galactica. However, if you buy the Complete Battlestar Galactica DVD Set (as most BSG fans would now that they are on DVD) this movie is on the first disk. Don't make the mistake I made and buy both. Once again, if you buy Battlestar Galactica: The Complete Epic Series, you do not need to purchase this item. While this is good, I don't see the point in buying it. You can buy it and the whole TV series in a boxed set, so to be able to buy just this seperate doesn't make sense.
B00005JMYI|5.0|Whoever says this film is junk is ignorant and doesn't know what good comedy is.  This is one of Will Farrell's best roles and the cast he paired up with really made the film work.  There were many corny one-liners in the movie, but they were FUNNY.  I also loved the fact that this DVD also had a bunch of special features, they're also hilarious.
B00004RD54|4.0|\\"Street Hassle being, in my humble opinion, his most daring and authentic rock contribution. One of the best live rock albums of my time. Great guitars, Lou is strong here-at the top of his game. But what do I know? I love \\"Magic and Loss\\" and dig \\"The Raven.\\" Lou is Lou- an original.
630542845X|5.0|This movie has been one of my favorites since I first saw it years ago.  I bought this DVD from Amazon, I had it on VHS but decided it was time for DVD.  I love this movie because of what I get from it.  \\"Powder\\" (played by Sean Patrick Flanery) was outcasted from day one... I wont say how because I won't ruin the movie for anyone that hasn't seen it yet, but he was picked on, and always felt alone.  I felt a connection with the character so I took to the movie right away.  It's just an over all really great story.  Very touching scenes that can be quite emotional at times.  If you've ever felt alone at any point in your life, check this movie out, you won't regret it.  This will always be one of my favorite movies of all time.
B000021YQV|5.0|This album is just great the songs are usually very short but i can get past that cuz they are awesome. Even though he doesn't have any crazy insane guitar solos Daron Malakian is still a genius guitar player that makes killer riffs. If you've never heard SOAD before i warn you now that they are extremely wierd but extremely good.
B00025ETIW|5.0|Finally there is some creativity leaking into a genre that for so long has been characterized by power chords, poorly executed vocals, and mediocre melodies.<br /><br />My Chemical Romance has put out the best cd this year so far, on top of two of the best music videos.
6304233639|4.0|I see this movie on all the time on television and I still stay and watch it from time to time.  I love the ensuing hilarity as Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum team up to take out the mother ship, as well as the intense special effects for the aliens, the air battles, and the destruction.  All in all, this movie is very well put together and is a good buy for anyone who seeks some adventure!
B000002N3J|5.0|This compilation album compiles some of Madonna's best ballads, singles and non-singles. It also contains new songs \\"You'll See,\\" \\"One More Chance\\" and two versions of \\"I Want You.\\" Some of my personal favorites include, \\"I'll Remember,\\" \\"Take A Bow,\\" \\"Live To Tell,\\" \\"Crazy For You,\\" and \\"You'll See.\\" I love this albums! It's so easy to listen to, when you're having a stressful day. Pop this in, lay back, and relax!
0156027321|4.0|The novel is excellent in terms of its thematics: on belief, on a human's place in the ecosystem, and so on. Its images are powerful, both those that are beautiful and those that are horrifying. There's a good bit of violence described in the novel, a good bit of blood and guts and all that would or might attend a story about surviving at sea with (possibly) four wild animals or (possibly) other desperate humans. Not for the squeamish. Not for those who can't stop anthropomorphizing animals or who won't bear the savagery born of desperation to live. It's not a question of narrative skill on Martel's part, but of the reader's taste or capacity to handle these scenes. One might then ask, is there any comparison between enduring reading about these incidents and actually enduring them? Hardly, but I found the reading of such to be so gruelling that I docked the novel a star.
B000002NJS|5.0|This is probably the best studio album Madonna has ever created! Her voice sounds amazing in it, and each song puts you into a trance. This is one of Madonna's most iconic albums, with some of her best work yet! I love this album! I love it more then anyother Madonna albums actually! People tend to go for her older 1980's stuff, but those people don't know. This album puts all of Madonna's past work aside, and blows your mind! <br /> <br />01.

0312965788|5.0|I first became acquainted with the \\"All Creatures\\" series written by James Herriot as a high school student writing a theme paper for my British literature class. After reading the first installment I quickly read through the rest of the series \\" All Things Bright and Beautiful, All Things Wise and Wonderful, The Lord God Made Them All\\". The plot centers around James Herriot, a newly qualified veternarian and his employment as assistant veternarian to Siegfried Farnon in the village of Darrowby. You will also meet a cast of colorful characters, Tristian Farnon, Siegfried's younger brother, Helen Alderson, Mrs. Hall, Mrs. Pumphrey and her Pekinese, Tricky-Woo,and a host of other colorful characters who make this a memorable read. James Herriot has also authored several other books, each one stands on its own merit and are a treasure for your family library. The BBC also produced the series \\" All Creatures Great and Small\\" for television in the late 1970's. The series is a masterpiece! I would highly recommend watching the episodes as you read through the books. The books/series are fantastic family entertainment!
B000002LND|5.0|Madonna is one of the greatest performers on earth, and this album is a showcase to some of her best work in the 80's. It also includes 2 new songs that were recorded specifically for this greatest hits package, \\"Justify My Love\\" and \\"Rescue Me.\\" It also contains her best and well known hits, such as, \\"Material Girl,\\" \\"Holiday,\\" \\"Like A Virgin,\\" \\"La Isla Bonita,\\" \\"Vogue\\" and much, much more!

B0001FGBL6|2.0|Let me start off by saying that I am a fan of operatic metal. I love Therion, Theatre of Tragedy, Tristiana, Lacuna Coil, Nightwish, all of the bands that any self respecting music fan should listen to. However, I should have seen this one coming. I must say, witohut a frickin doubt, this is the cheesiest album that I have ever had the displeasure of listening to. I shelled out 15 bucks for this album and I wish that I saved my money and bought a knife and stabbed myself in the frickin eardrums, and then bought a bucket of sulfuric acid and drowned myself in it. The band overall has good musicianship, (and their singer is hot), yet they write sub par music with cheesy medieval themes. THe band has potential, and it might help if the f***in music video wasn't a sing along with the words at the bottom of the screen. Please, if you are considering purchasing this album, dont make the same mistake I did, and buy Therion's Lemuria/Sirius B. Trust me, you'll be glad you shelled out the extra 5 clams.
B00005J6SZ|4.0|This is definitly the most bubble gum pop album Madonna has ever put out by far! But it's also Madonna's signature album. Everybody knows her as the \\"Material Girl\\" and everyone knows the words to \\"Like A Virgin.\\" This is the very album that get Britney Spears and so many others inspired to be a pop-tart.
B000002MQ9|5.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed every CD I've purchased by DCD, and \\"Within the Realm of a Dying Sun\\" is no exception. This particular CD actually gave me an idea for a short story.
B000002MUW|4.0|This album is probably the first and only Madonna album that is full of R&B music. It just shows you how versatile Madonna is when it comes to whatever she does.

B00008WJBU|2.0|\\"Intacto\\" concerns a hidden subculture of people who can steal luck from others, and barter or win it from each other.  An intriguing concept, to be sure, and it makes for a good premise for a film.<br /><br />A movie needs more than a high concept, though.  A fantasy like this demands a lot in its execution.  In particular, the script must establish an internal logic very early on, and follow that internal logic, in order to allow the audience to suspend their disbelief and enter into the fantasy.  \\"Intacto\\" unfortunately throws internal logic and common sense right out the window.  The characters' actions make no sense much of the time, and the script and direction obfuscate and confuse rather than advance any kind of plot.  Contrast this with the superior movie \\"The Cooler,\\" which also dealt with a man who could affect the luck of others.  Whatever its faults, and it had some, at least the basic premise of the cooler's relationship with luck & how it worked was set out early in the movie, and was comprehensible.<br /><br />I'll give it an extra star for trying something different, and for generally good performances.  But, I wouldn't watch this again.  If you're at the video store at 11 pm on Friday and your only choices are this, \\"Shattered Glass\\" and some WWF videos, just go home and read a book.
B00005J6T1|5.0|This is the album that made Madonna a true star! Her very first album which contains hits such as \\"Holiday,\\" \\"Lucky Star,\\" \\"Burning Up,\\" and more is what got the masses attention and started Madonna's career in a hugely successful way. A cross between disco and pop, this album is must for all pop listeners, young and old. A classic by the Queen herself.
0399208534|5.0|My kids and I love this book. I think my 2 year old may have actually learned the days of the week after reading this book so much - at least I know that I didn't teach them to her! My only hang up is why Eric Carle states that the butterfly pops out of a cocoon instead of a chrysalis. Yes, chrysalis might be a bigger word for little ones, but I'm sure they would pick it up just like everything else. Despite the word choice, this is a favorite!
B000002LGQ|5.0|\\"Like A Prayer\\" was actually the very first CD I've ever owned. It's also what got me to become a Madonna fan in the early 90's. This album is the best album Madonna put out in the 80's. Including monster hits like the self-titled track, \\"Express Yourself,\\" \\"Cherish,\\" \\"Oh Father\\" and much more! This album is timeless and a classic in the music industry! For me the best track is a ballad that Madonna wrote about her mother who passed away when Madonna was at the age of 5. You can tell the song was written from Madonna's heart, the song is called \\"Promise To Try.\\" If Madonna would have released it as a single, it would have shot straight up to #1. Acutally, if Madonna released all 10 tracks (excluding \\"Act Of Contrition\\") as a single, all of them would have been mega hits. This album is full of nothing but hits! <br /> <br />01.

B00082IJ08|3.0|I really liked the first Gorillaz album. The standard beat structures fitted in nicely to what I categorise as \\"music\\". Well unfortunately, I found some of the quirky songs on this album a bit \\"left of centre\\" for my narrow musical taste. I just bought it anyway so I could have a cool disc in my collection. Now when my friends come over I will still be accepted by them when they say \\"Oh I have that CD too!\\"
B00005Q66T|4.0|This is a must for any true Madonna fan. It's also a convenience for listeners so you don't have to keep changing Madonna CDs back an forth. GHV2 contains most of Madonna's #1 hit singles starting from 1992-2000. This album is the follow up to The Immaculate Collection that was released in 1990. The only thing is, unlike Madonna's first greatest hits album, GHV2 doesn't contain any new tracks. I understand Madonna wanted to keep it a \\"greatest hits,\\" but damn, it could have used some new or previously unreleased tracks. But, I sill love this album. Filled with more recent and underrated Madonna songs. <br /> <br />01. Deeper And Deeper 4/5 <br />02. Erotica (Radio Edit) 5/5 <br />03. Human Nature (Radio Version) 3/5  <br />04.

B0002OXVDW|5.0|I grew up during the M-G-M years of musical dominance. I loved these films and always looked forward to new ones opening at my local theaters. When the studio produced the 'THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT' films, they took the cream of the musical numbers in their vaults and strung them together in these films to preserve them for musical buffs. This set features newly restored film and 5.1 digital sound, thereby increasing the enjoyment to film buffs ten fold. I loved viewing these discs when they arrived, as they brought back the charm of a more innocent era and still had as much appeal to me as they did when I first watched them in the theaters.  Two thumbs up!!!

0060751967|5.0|I was expecting a light, fun, entertaining read from Ms. Sparks, and HOW TO MARRY A MILLIONAIRE VAMPIRE certainly delivered.  To my surprise, however, the book was not only funny and sexy but surprisingly deep, with its exploration of good, evil, and redemption.  And the modern vampire world created by Ms. Sparks is so cleverly creative.<br /><br />The handsome Roman is a fabulous wounded hero, vulnerable in spite of his unnatural abilities, and Shanna, the heroine, is smart and funny -- a worthy match for him.  I can't wait for the next one.  Bring on the vamps!

B0006FFRVG|5.0|I really love KEANE and Hopes and Fears, and the enhanced version is really cool. I love it because you actually get to see the music videos. There is MUCH to see on this Duel-disc! I highly recommend purchasing this, and the second album once it's released in 2006. Keane is the best thing that's ever happened to me, their music will change your life.
B0009HLDFU|1.0|I'd love to buy this album, but I'm against copy-protection. Sorry, RCA and Foo Fighters, but you lost a sale. <br /> <br />My rights don't need management!
B0006399FS|4.0|I'm astonished at the number of negative reviews that U2' s \\"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\\" has gotten on Amazon.  To be sure, this is far from U2's best album; they may never top 1987's \\"The Joshua Tree.\\"  And it's not as immediately appealing as their 2000 comeback, \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind.\\"  But to my ears, this is a solid and rewarding rock album, without frills or gimmickry. <br /> <br />U2 isn't going for an experimental sound, as they did with \\"Achtung Baby\\" or \\"Zooropa,\\" nor are they trying to integrate past successes as they did on \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind.\\"  Rather, they crystallize their sound to deliver a personal, introspective set of songs, driven as much by the three instrumentalists as by Bono's reliably passionate lyrics and vocals. Adam Clayton's booming bass powers songs like \\"Love and Peace or Else\\" and \\"A Man and a Woman.\\"  The Edge continues to find nuances for his signature sound, experimenting with feedback and distortion.  Larry Mullen Jr., one of rock's least flashy drummers, is solid and reliable as ever.  For his part, Bono employs octave harmonies to create a haunting, hypnotic effect on tracks like \\"Crumbs from your Table,\\" \\"All Because of You,\\" and \\"Yahweh\\".  <br /> <br />The unconventional track sequencing may disorient the casual listener.  For example, U2 breaks the momentum established by the energetic opener, \\"Vertigo,\\" with a couple of mid-tempo tracks, \\"Miracle Drug\\" and \\"Sometime You Can't Make it On Your Own.\\" These songs build slowly and require repeated listening to appreciate. <br /> <br />While \\"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\\" doesn't achieve the lofty heights of \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\" - there's nothing quite as impressive as \\"Beautiful Day,\\" \\"Walk On,\\" or \\"Kite\\" - it's more consistent throughout. The weakest songs occur toward album's end: the moody \\"One Step Closer\\" never fully develops, and \\"Original of the Species\\" sounds like it was cobbled from bits of earlier U2 songs.   <br /> <br />With \\"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb,\\" U2 succeeds in honing their sound into a mature, cohesive work.  It's a noble and worthy addition to the discography of one of rock's all-time great bands.

B000002J0B|5.0|Houses of The Holy(1973). Led Zeppelin's Fifth Album.<br /><br />By the time 'Houses of The Holy' was released, Led Zeppelin was a rock phenomenon. 'Zoso(IV)' and 'Led Zeppelin II' had both sold over ten million copies, and Led Zeppelin was accepted with a frenzy that hadn't been seen since the Beatles and Elvis. When released, 'Houses of the Holy' shot to the top of the charts, and songs like 'Over The Hills And Far Away', 'Dancing Days', 'D'Yer Mak'er' , and 'The Ocean' became massive hits for Led Zeppelin. This album went on to sell over ten million copies, and is one of Led Zeppelin's most recognized and praised albums. So is this album as good as you'd expect? Read on to find out!<br /><br />Track Rating-<br /><br />The Song Remains The Same- Jimmy Page's little guitar opera, \\"The Song Remains The Same\\" blares out of your speakers, sonically drenching you with Page's blasting power chords and John Paul Jones funky bassline. This song is totally original, as you won't really hear anything like it. A little bluesy, funky, and progressive, it's a mishmash of rock styles, and it plays out perfectly. Page is amazing here! You can actually feel the emotion here! Amazing epic little song.<br /><br />The Rain Song- Although not a mainstream song, \\"The Rain Song\\" has remained a fan favorite over the years. A sad little folk tune, Jimmy Page's soft, brooding guitar melodies are truly beautiful. Robert Plant's vocals are very hushed and thoughtful, and really fit the song. Although some may overlook this one, listen to this in a quiet place, and you'll see it's beauty.<br /><br />Over The Hills And Far Away- A huge hit for Led Zeppelin, \\"Over The Hills And Far Away\\" is a blend of folk and hard rock, and remains fresh to his day. Page's and Plant's soft melodies soon burst into a loud, boisterous, hard rocker that Zeppelin does best. Crank the volume up, sit back, and listen to some good classic rock.<br /><br />The Crunge- \\"The Crunge\\" is an unabashed funk song, and it's absolutely amazing. Freaky cool drumming, a super-funky bassline, and funky guitar licks that you might think come from Prince. Although I might be making it sound like this sounds like a totally different band, this is still obviously Led Zeppelin. Funky and awesome.<br /><br />Dancing Days- A rather dark song, \\"Dancing Days\\" celestial power chords blow out your speakers in dramatic fashion, not unlike the masterful \\"Kashmir\\". Plant's vocals are dark and mysterious, and Page's brilliant guitarwork awes me everyday. How do you not like it?<br /><br />D'Yer Mak'er- \\"D'Yer Mak'er\\" finds Led Zeppelin playing back to their reggae influences, and the results are amazing. A lot like \\"All of My Love\\", \\"D'Yer Mak'er\\" is much heavier, but they both are emotional love songs. Gotta love this one.<br /><br />No Quarter- For a while, \\"No Quarter\\" was my favorite Led Zeppelin track. Although not anymore, when I first listened to this masterpiece, I was overcome by it. Very weird and experimental, \\"No Quarter\\" is very slow-paced and melodic, but the spooky verses lead up to an amazing chorus. Jimmy Page's ultra-distorted riffs are extremely cool, and were the reason I became so hooked. Plant's vocals are very celestial... it's almost as if hearing a ghost whisper to you from the afterlife. John Paul Jones and Page both play beautiful piano and guitar harmonies, and they sound fantastic. Not for everyone, but if you give it a chance, I'm sure you'll love it.<br /><br />The Ocean- Another favorite of mine, \\"The Ocean\\" is pure, classic hard rock. It oozes sarcasm and bad behavior, and truly has a pure rock sound. Page's loud, addictive power chords back Plant's loud, sarcastic vocals. This song is totally addictive... put this song on at a party, it should get people dancing(unless they listen to rap!). Awesome.<br /><br />'Houses of the Holy' is an amazing album. It's hard to say, but it might just be my favorite. With a combination of blazing hard rock like \\"The Ocean\\" and \\"Over The Hills and Far Away\\", not to mention epics like \\"The Rain Song\\", \\"No Quarter\\", and the \\"The Song Remains The Same\\", this album seems to cover all of Zeppelin's different styles into a tight package. It seems like Led Zeppelin has the Midas touch... everything they touch turns to gold. If you have a classic rock collection without this album, it's not complete. Please buy this album.<br /><br />Also Recommended-<br /><br />Led Zeppelin II- Led Zeppelin<br /><br />Toys In The Attic- Aerosmith<br /><br />Billion Dollar Babies- Alice Cooper<br /><br />Thanks For Reading!\\"The Ocean\\" and \\"Over The Hills and Far Away\\", not to mention epics like \\"The Rain Song\\", \\"No Quarter\\", and the \\"The Song Remains The Same\\", this album seems to cover all of Zeppelin's different styles into a tight package.

B0001907DA|5.0|Excellent collection, I think that the DVD's are masterized because the image is almost perfect, like if you were watching a movie of today.

The only thing bad that this collection have is that it does not include audio in spanish, only English and French, but at least it have spanish subtitles. I REALLY RECOMEND TO BUY.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|Van Halen(1978). Van Halen's First Record.<br /><br />Around 1975, after immigrating to America, brothers Eddie Van Halen and Alex Van Halen teamed up with bassist Michael Anthony and vocalist David Lee Roth to form Mammoth. After later changing their name to Van Halen, the band was noticed by KISS vocalist Gene Simmons, and he immediately got them a record deal. In 1978, Van Halen was released with much fanfare, pushing the singles \\"Runnin' With The Devil\\", \\"Ain't Talkin' Bout Love\\", and \\"Jamies' Cryin\\". Later, guitarists' favorite, \\"Eruption\\", and the singles \\"You Really Got Me\\" and \\"Ice Cream Man\\" became huge hits. Because of it's upbeat mood and hip new sound, 'Van Halen' became a popular party album, and sold over 10 million copies. Without a doubt, Van Halen was destined to be rock superstars, but is this album just overrated? Read on to find out!<br /><br /> In 1978, Van Halen was the newest sound on the block. Eddie Van Halen's guitar techniques were unheard of! Things like 'tapping' and 'divebombs' were unheard of in the 70's, although they later were abused to death by hair metal bands. His style and tone were completely new, and this album manages to hold up even after all these years. David Lee Roth, although he wasn't the best vocalist, his vocals seemed to fit perfectly, and he was the perfect rock singer: showy and over-the-top. Alex Van Halen has always been a favorite drummer of mine, and songs like \\"Jamies' Cryin'\\" and \\"Eruption\\" he performs flawlessly. Micheal Anthony is an awesome bassist, and the work on this album and later Van Halen albums is amazing.<br /><br /> As you can tell, Van Halen was full of great musicians, but they were also amazing songwriters. \\"Jamies' Cryin\\" and \\"Little Dreamer\\" are both poignant love songs, and they stand out as some of their best. \\"Ain't Talkin' Bout Love\\", \\"I'm The One\\", \\"Feel Your Love Tonight\\", and \\"On Fire\\" are all badass rock n' rollers, songs that Van Halen are best known for.  If you like these songs, you will love Van Halen. \\"Runnin' With The Devil\\" is an interesting song, a song that will take many back to their days as a rebel. \\"You Really Got Me\\" is a cover of a Kinks classic, and Van Halen serves proper justice to this classic. This is one of the coolest songs on the album... that riff just sucks you in! \\"Atomic Punk\\" and \\"Ice Cream Man\\" are both funky tunes that any fan will recognize... they both show Van Halen had a sense of humor. Of course, there's \\"Eruption\\" the fabled guitar tune that spawned a generation of wankers and finger tapping guitarists who idolized Eddie Van Halen. To this day, it's still amazing.<br /><br /> What can I say? This album is flawless. Every song is amazing, and this album is well-worth the low price. Along with '1984', this album is absolutely essential for Van Halen fans.  It's amazing, you can still play this album at parties! If you're a fan of rock and metal, I pity you if you don't own this album... your collection is lacking! This is one of those albums you can listen to a million times and never get tired of.<br /><br />(...)\\"Runnin' With The Devil\\" is an interesting song, a song that will take many back to their days as a rebel. \\"You Really Got Me\\" is a cover of a Kinks classic, and Van Halen serves proper justice to this classic.

B00025ETIW|3.0|My Chemical Romance is a band that tends to stand out from the rest of the MTV rock band crowd, a band that seems to make a musical statement rather than a financial one.<br /><br />By that I mean, MCR is more talented than most emo that I have heard. I commend them, because they are the only emo band that has actually influenced me to purchase one of their CDs. I don't own a single other emo CD in my entire collection (500+ discs). Amazingly, MCR's \\"Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge\\" STILL gets heavy rotation in my CD Player.<br /><br />This album has many promising tracks, such as Helena, To The End, I'm Not Okay, The Ghost of You (which actually influenced me to buy the album), The Jetset Life Is Going to Kill You, and Cemetery Drive.<br /><br />I'll admit I was disappointed however, because I was not expecting emo the day I bought the album. \\"The Ghost of You\\" denies any existence of emo within reachable distance of the band, so I was expecting something along the lines of Modest Mouse, Muse, Radiohead, etc. Upon hearing \\"Helena\\" as the first track, I said, 'Wow...this sounds a lot like emo. I really don't like this.'<br /><br />But as time went on, I learned to appreciate it for what it was, and though I'm not an emo fan, I still do listen to this album quite often.<br /><br />The only problem I have with this album is the production. I know most people couldn't care about how modern music is mastered to blow out their ears within five listens, but I care about my hearing (being an audio engineer). I believe this album would have been much better if the energy hadn't been raped by smashing the dynamics to complete dust. Songs like \\"To The End\\" constantly push the 0 mark on the dB meter during the verse, and has no room to build up or get louder when the chorus kicks in. It makes the song uninteresting and less engergetic, even if the song was performed with great energy and skill (as most of them are on this disc).<br /><br />I set a higher standard for MCR than most emo bands, but they still are at a lower level of respect to me than most bands I listen to. My Chemical Romance is still JUST a band to me; maybe some day when they decide to be more artistic and show a view other than death, I will come to appreciate them more.<br /><br />I know most of the viewers here could care less to what I have to say about the band or the album in general, just that \\"I'm Not Okay\\" hazz to bee the bezt song in existEnCe!!! But for those who actually care about music as a living, breathing art, if you agree, say so by clicking that button down there.<br /><br />So in short,<br /><br />Buy this disc if you are into good music. Buy this disc ESPECIALLY if you are into good emo.<br /><br />That is all. :-)<br /><br />~Jaredd for MCR than most emo bands, but they still are at a lower level of respect to me than most bands I listen to.

B000002UCN|1.0|As a self-proclaimed dark horse, George Harrison's solo albums are hit and miss. But mostly miss as this hastily assembled compilation points out. It says alot that over half the songs on this so called greatest hits are Beatles songs. The other tracks don't represent the few solo album he made up until the end of Apple records in 1976. <br /> <br />The two best songs here (My Sweet Lord and What Is Life) are from his best solo album All Things Must Pass. But missing are Apple Scruffs, Art Of Dying, All Things Must Pass and Isn't It A Pity. Also missing is the title track from his album Living In The Material World. <br /> <br />The only reason to purchase this CD is for the song Bangla Desh. While not one of his best songs, it is found nowhere else on CD. <br /> <br />Until the greedheads at Capitol make a true Best Of, we'll have to make our own single-disc compilation. Here are the tracks needed: Apple Scruffs, My Sweet Lord, All Things Must Pass, What Is Life, Give Me Love (Give Me Peace On Earth), Living In The Material World, Crackerbox Palace, Blow Away, All Those Years Ago, Dream Away, Cloud 9, This Is Love, Someplace Else, Got My Mind Set On You, End Of The Line, Handle With Care, Cheer Down, Devil's Been Busy, Any Road, Rising Sun. <br /> <br />[DW] <br />
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I very much enjoyed my favorite production on film.  I was disappointed to find that the regular edition was absent of special features.  The 2-disc special edition of Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom of the Opera is definitally worth while.  It includes Andrew Lloyd Webber's original venture into the The Phantom of the Opera as a theater production and the making of the music that moved the hearts of millions.  It includes interviews with the cast, including the mesmerizing Emmy Rossum.  I was amazed to find that the young actress, sixteen, had been in the chorus of the Metropolitan Opera House since the age of seven.  It also includes a scene and song especially made for the film, but was not put into the final product.  I would definitally recommend the purchase of this film to all those who were lost in the beauty, mystery, and grandeur of the production of the Phantom of the Opera.  Joel Schumacher and Andrew Lloyd Webber did a wonderful job in transforming this drawing production into a film that will be treasured for years to come.  On that note, I would also suggest the 2-disc special edition Phantom of the Opera CD.  With the resources used to make the film, the beautiful and alluring music was performed at its finest.
B0009HLDFU|1.0|I was looking foreward to purchasing the CD but not now. Thanks for the heads up on the copy protection, and marginalizing of the Foo Fighters and the Mac.
B000819PKC|4.0|It was a long wait between albums, but at least it was worth it.  If you're a big fan of their first two albums, which are a lot less produced and have more of a raw edge to them, then this isn't going to be up your alley.  If you're more of a fan of their past few albums, then you'll probably be more into this.  I enjoy both types of their music, but it would be nice if just once we could hear a didgeridoo again on an album.  Although I know in different interviews Jay Kay has said that every song can't have social impact, that sometimes you just have to write songs to dance to, it would also be nice if there was a little more connection to the Earth.  If you're going to incorporate a North American Indian tribe into your group's name, then you can't ignore those kind of connections.<br />That being said, there is some great work on the album and more than enough beats to get you moving.  The only track that seems to fail is &quot;Love is Blind&quot;, which eventually grows on you, but will initially sound like a mess. When that track goes into the bridge, you'll be wondering why they didn't do the whole song like that.<br />Even though the band has lost a couple of members (to things like wanting to spend more time with kids), you won't notice a big difference in the musicianship.  Since there is a lot more production here than on the first two albums, the beats and bass work are simple enough that any skilled musician should be able to handle things.  Jay Kay's voice is still dead on and hasn't changed at all over the years.  <br />Highlights from the album have to the title track, &quot;Dynamite&quot;, where the backing vocals are used effectively (you'll find yourself chanting &quot;Dynamite, dynamite&quot; while you're driving) and &quot;Talullah&quot;, where Jay Kay shows that he can still make a slower jam have a little bite, allowing the bassline to do the work.<br />So yeah, a great album, but a little overproduced if you like their earlier stuff.  Get ready to move.
B000002U82|4.0|Obviously it's hard to review a record that's made it to top ten rock lists just about everywhere, as well as being one of the best selling records of all time. That's a lot to live up to. In my honest opinion I can say that it ALMOST lives up to it's reputation. <br /> <br />Before I get into the individual songs (if you can call them individual) I'd like to say that in no way do I believe that this is Pink Floyd's best album. That title belongs to either \\"Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\" or \\"Wish You Were Here,\\" two starkly different but equally superb entries from Floyd. <br /> <br />The album starts off with \\"Breathe/Speak to Me,\\" a beautiful, atmospheric opener that perfectly sets the trippy tone that's going to pop up during the rest of the album. It's one of the best tracks on the album as well. It was just a very unique and brilliant move to make a collage of sounds that appear at various times during the album and put them in the beginning of this song. Of course you wouldn't know what it was until the second time you listen to the album, but it was a very artsy move, and a good one at that. It's starts the album off very well. <br /> <br />Some of the highlights are \\"Time,\\" \\"Money,\\" and \\"Brain Damage/Eclipse,\\" \\"Time\\" and \\"Money\\" being the heavy (and funky at times) rockers on the album. Both of them contain some relatively famous guitar solos and brilliant usage of sound effects throughout. Gilmour's either got some heavy fuzz, or twangy blues guitar and it really fits, or should I say he MAKES it fit. <br /> <br />\\"Brain Damage/Eclipse\\" is a triumphant sounding ending number that really ends the album on a high note. But that's where my complaints come in...that's it. With the exception of \\"Us and Them\\" (which is just entirely to slow for my liking) the rest is just filler. \\"On the Run\\" is just a 3 mintue long synth and drum loop. \\"The Great Gig in the Sky\\" sounds very over indulgent with the exaggerated screams of a soul singer pulling the entire  4  (almost5) mintue song. \\"Any Color You Like\\" is the most interesting of the three fillers with some heavy effect driven guitar solos popping up, but for the most part it's just another 3 minute synth workout. <br /> <br />In no way shape or form am I trying to convince anyone not to check this album out. In fact, I'm relatively sure any review is going to change a persons mind about this particular album. It's become so famous over the years that it's classic status has led some people to completely ignore it's problems in certain places. What I can tell you is that this is a very atmospheric, well devised record that definitely deserves attention, but when it comes to the fame it's recieved over the years, I can't say I think it lived up to it's reputation. But hey, one could argue that all the filler was created in order to sync up better with \\"The Wizard of Oz.\\" Who knows. I just know I like watching the movie more when the album is playing with it...
B0000039QA|5.0|As you're probably aware, the Notorious B.I.G.'s life was tragically cut short in March 1997, and his final album, the double-disc \\"Life After Death,\\" was released as scheduled mere weeks later. \\"Life After Death\\" is stunning in more ways than one. In a word, this album is epic. Over the course of two discs and 24 tracks, Biggie compiled a spectacle of a collection, with big-time productions, A-list collaborations, and hit singles. More so than his landbreaking debut [[ASIN:B0000039PW Ready to Die]], which was overall a grimier, humbler approach to a masterpiece, \\"Life After Death\\" is a big-budget, remarkable project to behold. Where his debut was filled with rags-to-riches tales of hustling and crime, the change his newfound wealth brought to his lifestyle is refelcted in his sophomore effort. The glamorous tales of his lavish lifestyle are highlighted in club tracks and party jams, but lyrically and technically he is as good here as he ever was. The spooky storytelling, hilarious punchlines, wide-eyed philosophy, and chilling threats are at their most effective. Technically, he is even better than before, utilizing an impeccable flow and vocabulary. Probably most stunning though, is the dramatic way in which he talks about death, given that he would die before this album would even be released. Whether referring to others or himself, his talk of the afterlife and judgement is among the most interesting and amazing parts this album has to offer. The tracklist is long and split between many types of tracks, including great radio-friendly singles, grimy street anthems, chilling narratives, seductive tracks for the ladies, and club songs. But somehow, he was able to pull all of these different intangibles together for another fluent masterpiece. Sean Combs and Easy Mo Bee anchor a production team that also includes such big names as Clark Kent, RZA, Kay Gee, Buckwild, and DJ Premier for production that lives up to the MC in every manner. \\"Life After Death\\" is another incredible hip hop album and much to behold.<br /><br />Following the intro, the first disc opens with \\"Somebody's Gotta Die,\\" a hard, grimy narrative with production and lyricism that will bring to mind multiple tracks from the debut. The light-hearted \\"Hypnotize\\" is an unforgettable single that remains in heavy radio rotation even today, a bass-heavy party jam with funny punchlines and a silly hook. DJ Premier produced \\"Kick in the Door,\\" a solid, upbeat track, and R. Kelly guests on the popular \\"F... You Tonight,\\" a seductive love song with great production. Fellow (then) Bad Boy artists The LOX collaborate for \\"Last Day,\\" a hard-hitting streets cut, and Jay-Z and Angela Winbush are the guests for the lavish anthem \\"I Love the Dough.\\" This song is a definite highlight, the production is rich, upbeat, and very funky, and the happy yet thoughtful song is lots of fun to listen to. \\"What's Beef?\\" assesses the state of rivalry both in hip hop and urban life, lyrically a strong piece. Biggie's most famous single comes next on the tracklist, \\"Mo Money Mo Problems,\\" a true anthem featuring Ma$e, Puff Daddy, and a sample from Diana Ross. This song is ingeniously produced, utilizing the sample brilliantly, and the joyful verses combined with great production equal a true musical triumph for the trio, the song that epitomized Bad Boy Records. The rough \\"N... Bleed\\" and the clever \\"I Got a Story to Tell,\\" the tale of a late-night escapade over a nice beat, close disc one.<br /><br />Disc two opens with a bang, the epic six-minute Bone Thugs-N-Harmony collaboration \\"Notorious Thugs.\\" This song is a true classic, with a phenomenal, Cleveland-styled beat and well-written, rapid-fire verses from the MCs. 112 provides the R&B hook and bridge for the sad \\"Miss U,\\" which flexes great production, and his young protege Lil Kim provides a memorable appearance on the funny \\"Another.\\" At this point, the classic joints come one after another. \\"Going Back to Cali\\" is an excellent, upbeatfunker with the luxurious tales of laidback life on the west coast. DJ Premier's masterful production on \\"Ten Crack Commandments\\" provides a backdrop for Biggie to drop wisdom from his days as a hustler. \\"Playa Hater\\" is the funniest song on the album, where Biggie sings like a silly soul singer, hilariously informing a victim, \\"You've been robbed.\\" The light and funky \\"Nasty Boy\\" precedes another dramatic 112 collaboration, which opens with words of motivation from none other than his mother. My favorite song on the whole album is \\"The World Is Filled...,\\" which features Too Short and Puff Daddy. This song doesn't stand out among the epic tracks here, but I've always found the laidback production and harsh philosophy relaxing. The last three songs are the most stunning, epic, and dramatic, dealing with death. \\"My Downfall\\" samples Run-DMC for a chilling chorus, a very well done and effective song. The infamous Wu-Tang beatcraft the RZA produced \\"Long Kiss Goodnight,\\" an eerie threat to a backstabber with an excellent chorus.

DJ Premier's masterful production on \\"Ten Crack Commandments\\" provides a backdrop for Biggie to drop wisdom from his days as a hustler. \\"Playa Hater\\" is the funniest song on the album, where Biggie sings like a silly soul singer, hilariously informing a victim, \\"You've been robbed.\\" The light and funky \\"Nasty Boy\\" precedes another dramatic 112 collaboration, which opens with words of motivation from none other than his mother. My favorite song on the whole album is \\"The World Is Filled...,\\" which features Too Short and Puff Daddy. This song doesn't stand out among the epic tracks here, but I've always found the laidback production and harsh philosophy relaxing. The last three songs are the most stunning, epic, and dramatic, dealing with death. \\"My Downfall\\" samples Run-DMC for a chilling chorus, a very well done and effective song. The infamous Wu-Tang beatcraft the RZA produced \\"Long Kiss Goodnight,\\" an eerie threat to a backstabber with an excellent chorus.

B000058983|5.0|It's hard to understand why great albums are so often overlooked, but this album in particular is a hidden gem. Despite it's appearance on many top 100 (and even 10 on occasion) rock albums of all time, this one, for the most part, has been forgotten by the general public. It's a shame too, because it rightfully belongs on those top 100 and 10 lists. <br /> <br />Without going through every single song (they're all beautiful and still sound fresh to this day) some of the highlights of the album include \\"Alone Again Or\\" \\"Old Man\\" \\"Red Telephone\\" and \\"Live and Let Live.\\" They're all unique blends of folk-rock, psychedelia, baroque, jazz, and hard rock in some places. At no time does this album sound over indulgent or overblown. The strings, which often make songs sound very cheesy, fit in perfectly with Arthur Lee's (and Maclean's) beautiful compositions and the horns add a certain power as well. None of it ever sounds out of place or forced. There are unique key changes and unusual vocals throughout that just make this album sound unusually innovative and perpetually fresh. Even nearly 40 years after it's release, there are things that can be heard and learned from this album. \\"Live and Let Live,\\" which really sounds like the albums staple, is a brilliant folky pop gem that incorporates a lot of the properties listed above, as well as some electric guitar work that is fitted in perfectly to add that extra power in the middle of the song. <br /> <br />To tell the truth, it's really hard for me to recommend individual songs on this album, as they're all great. And you can't say that about many albums. It's quite easy to listen to it completely through without it ever sounding tedious or overly long. It's just that good. Do yourself a favor and buy this album. There's really nothing else to say.
B0000039PW|5.0|The Notorious B.I.G.'s 1994 debut arrived at a turning point for hip hop music. As the old school style from the east coast was slowly growing stale, a new funkier and angrier approach was steadily growing in the form of gangsta rap from the west coast. Then, of course, came \\"Ready to Die,\\" one of the finest hip hop albums of all time, and one that bridged the gap between the old and new schools. This is the album that introduced the world to the incredible rapper and incredible character that was Christopher Wallace. A young, overweight Brooklyn native, a father, and a former hustler, Biggie impressed listeners not only with his talent but his personality on the mic. Technically, he is not short of amazing. His ingenious punchlines, late-night stories, threats, and jokes are delivered in his raspy, cheeky voice with precise technique, always on time and in a perfect flow. Lyrically, he covers many topics but the quality is ever so consistent. On one song, he'll be telling a story of crime, on the next song he'll be poking fun at a ghetto loser, or seducing a woman, nostalgically reminiscing over the past, or dramatically philosophizing about the meaning of life and death. His verses are all meticulously written and never lose your attention. Another reason \\"Ready to Die\\" is so great is the production. The young Sean Combs anchors a production team that uses extensive, clever sampling to create a unique musical backdrop for Biggie. The album is well divided between radio friendly singles and harder, darker songs that would be too rough for radio. The hardcore tracks inspired an entire generation of grimy New York rappers that would reign towards the late 1990s, but the influence of the popular singles could also be felt on urban radio for years to come. \\"Ready to Die\\" is an absolutely classic hip hop album and one of the finest ever, a must have for any collection.<br /><br />The album begins with a dramatic intro, which gives way to \\"Things Done Changed,\\" a well-produced and ironic look back at Biggie's humble roots. \\"Gimme the Loot\\" is one of the songs that shows his lyrical genius, where he plays multiple characters in a conversation, creating a classic track. \\"Machine Gun Funk\\" is an upbeat, funky cut sampling a song by Lords of the Underground for the hook. On the excellent \\"Warning,\\" Biggie again plays multiple characters during conversation, before dropping philosophy on backstabbers and issuing threats. The title track follows accordingly, as does the original mix of \\"One More Chance,\\" a song to a woman about their relationship (the more popular remix is not included on the tracklist). Perhaps my favorite song is the Method Man collaboration \\"The What,\\" a song where the two depressed MCs drop some dark knowledge and philosophy over a great beat. It doesn't get much better than having two of New York's finest rappers over a solid 1994-styled beat. \\"Juicy\\" is an absolute classic, an emotional and effective rags-to-riches look at his upbringing, effectively sampling an 80s R&B hit by Mtume. Another of my favorites is the hopeful \\"Everyday Struggle,\\" which is blessed with the nicest beat on the album, a sunny, clever production over which Biggie recounts the troubles of trying to get by. \\"Me & My B...\\" is a humorous and enjoyable tune, followed by the unforgettable hit \\"Big Poppa.\\" This song has a perfect, Isley Brothers-sampling beat, a head-nodding funker, and shows the humorously seductive BIG at his finest. The well done \\"Respect\\" and catchy \\"Friend of Mine\\" are worthy deep-album cuts, and the DJ Premier-produced \\"Unbelievable\\" has an unforgettable chorus and production. The album closes with one of his most stunning works, \\"Suicidal Thoughts,\\" a depressing insight of life from a suicidal person.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Ready to Die\\" is inspiring, beautiful, and immensely entertaining. This album doesn't sound like it has aged a bit, and even thirteen yeras later sounds as fresh and incredible as the day it dropped. Listeners of any age should be able to appreciate this masterpiece, it's so consistent that there's not one piece of skip material over seventeen tracks. Unarguably one of the finest hip hop albums ever, I cannot recommend it any higher.e should be able to appreciate this masterpiece, it's so consistent that there's not one piece of skip material over seventeen tracks.

0345452585|1.0|I am a big fan of Kellerman and have listened to most of the Alex Delaware novels, but I stopped listening after completing the second CD (out of 8) in this set.  I found the medical jargon depressing, overdone, and totally irrelevent to the puzzle (which I assume was discovering the identity of the serial killer).  Also, I didn't think the characters were particularly likeable.  I won't stop listening to the Alex Delaware stories read by the terrific John Rubenstein, but I wish I'd passed on this book.  The story was weak and the reader (Rob Kahn) was even weaker.  Maybe listening to the edition read by David Birney would have been better.
020530902X|5.0|If you need to learn how to write, this book is for you. Well-written and compact, \\"Elements of Style\\" gives you all you need to know to speak and write clearly and simply. I have had a copy of this book since my senior year in high school (I'm now 30). We can all benefit from solid writing advice and this book accomplishes just that! I LOVE the fact that it's not a 900-page book. At roughly 100 pages, it is small enough to throw into a briefcase for ready-reference.

B000063DHK|5.0|I remember when this double live album came out. I mean, in my opinion it truly proved that metal had most certainly made a comeback. I got SO tired of critics that I personally knew mentioning that AT the time, metal was enjoying a brief return. Heck, do you consider, approx. 1980 to, say 1995 a brief return? Because, to me, that's when metal as we know it was at it's strongest point. 'Live After Death' has always been a real treat to not only Maiden fans, but metal fans in general. I've enjoyed numerous plays of this release. I dug \\"Churchill's Speech\\", \\"Trooper\\", \\"Powerslave\\", the ass-kicking \\"Number Of the Beast\\", \\"Two Minutes To Midnight\\" and \\"Phantom Of The Opera\\" the best. I've discussed the topic before with several other Maidenites, but I thought that vocalist Bruce Dickinson handled the vocal chores of vintage Paul DiAnno numbers just fine. A should-have.
B00005JNZ4|3.0|Recently divorced school teacher Sarah (Lane) wants no part of the dating scene, but her family, including sister Carol (Perkins) and father Bill (Plummer) are bound and determined to get her dating.  Carol puts Sarah's profile on perfectmatch.com, and she ends up on a series of bad dates, and a date with her own father.  But then comes Jake (Cusack), who is also dealing with the end of his marriage and is also dealing with dating again.  Their first date is awkward, but not off-putting, and they both want to try again.  Of course, when things start to look good, Bob (Mulroney), the father of one of her students, enters the picture and makes things a little more complicated.<br /><br />\\"Must Love Dogs\\" is pretty much a standard romantic comedy.  There is nothin special about it to seperate it from any other romantic comedy.  Cusack and Lane are trying to make it work, but this formula can only take things so far.  That is a shame, because both are good actors that deserve a better story.  This one is for fans of the genre only.  Otherwise, stay away.

And another thing about the reviewers who say \\"Dont buy the cd they are just a hype\\" Who cares if you dont like the strokes, dont listen to them, nobody's making you. Go listen to something else. You should have borrowed their cd or listened to it from itunes before you bought it anyways.
074325144X|3.0|On balace, this is a highly illiminating read even for someone like me who has participated in the sport for 30 years. His emphasis on relaxation, funtional forward lean from the ankle, and attention to posture in general are things that every beginning runner needs to hear and every veteran runner needs to hear again. <br /> <br />If there are nits to pick, it's Danny's insitence on lumping Kenyans into one group of high achieving-never injured runners (which is not the case, many of the top Kenyan runners are injured, which is a reason why they only started two male runners instead of three at the Athens Olympics in 2004) and for mindless statements to the effect that Kenyan runners don't have big calves because they use ChiRunning principles. His big calf/small calf argument would have been better reasoned if he had included any research into genetic predisposition of the Kenyan running tribes.

B0007Y08QA|5.0|If you like your movies dark, depressing, eerie, mysterious, and borderline insane, The Machinist should definitely be on your \\"to see\\" list.  In these days of sequel- and remake-itis, it's always a treat to find a movie that dares to be original and to walk a dark line all its own.  Director Brad Anderson and Christian Bale definitely get an A+ for effort here, but I don't think the ending is quite as effective as it could have been.  It's easy to cross the line when you're dancing in a dark and narrow place, and the movie went just a little too far into \\"the whole world's crazy and everyone's out to get me\\" (which, on a completely unrelated point, is my personal motto) territory before bringing everything into focus.  (That doesn't stop me from giving the film five stars, however - The Machinist is worlds better than most of the junk coming out of Hollywood these days.)  Speaking of effort, I don't know what to say about Christian Bale - no Fat Albert to begin with - dropping 63 pounds in order to play the character of Trevor Reznik in this film.  He is painfully thin here; a few less pounds, and you could zoom him right through your copy machine and have all the Christian Bales you could want.  Why is his character so thin?  Well, he hasn't slept in a year, and that kind of wears on a fellow after a while.<br /><br />Trent is - you guessed it - a machinist.  It doesn't look like a great job, but he obviously makes a killing, as he leaves $20 tips every night at the diner and enjoys many an evening with a call girl who sort of becomes his girlfriend.  Jennifer Jason Leigh is about the only pretty thing you'll see in the 102 minutes of the film.  We first meet Trevor when he's approaching his breaking point.  The job of machinist can be quite hazardous, especially if you work with Trevor.  When a guy punches in with two arms and punches out with only one, the co-workers get a little restless.  Technically, it's Trevor's fault, but he was distracted by this seriously weird co-worker he had just recently met - a guy who, according to everyone else in the shop, doesn't even exist.  As you might expect, Trevor becomes rather obsessed about finding out who the guy is and what he wants.  As he goes increasingly cuckoo for cocoa puffs, his only links with sanity are Stevie (Jennifer Jason Leigh) the call girl and Marie (Aitana Sanchez-Gijon), his regular waitress at the airport caf&eacute;.<br /><br />The best way I can describe The Machinist is to suggest that it must be a lot like one of Tim Burton's dreams.  There's an oppressive pallor over the whole thing that seems to drain every single image of any color or vitality, and Trevor moves around rather wraith-like in his emaciated form.  The mystery of it all starts out with great strength, but I think the director just overplayed his hand a tiny bit - and, by doing so, made the ultimate ending somewhat (but not completely) predictable.  It's still a five-star effort all the way.  If you just want to forget the world and be entertained for an hour and a half, seek your pleasure elsewhere.  When you're ready to indulge the dark side of your personality and engage your mind at the same time, though, you could do much worse than settling yourself into a cocoon and entering the surreal world of The Machinist.  This film is, in a word, different.sly weird co-worker he had just recently met - a guy who, according to everyone else in the shop, doesn't even exist.

B00005JNJT|5.0|This movie is the revival of the dead franchise, solid acting, crisp writing, and fresh visuals make this movie a must see. I am a big fan of Tim Burton's original Batman and I think this one is every bit as good as that one. Christian Bale is the best of all the Batmans to date. Michael Keaton held his own and did a good job, Val Kilmer just brooded through the movie and looked like he was constipated, and George Clooney, holy hell that smirking jack-ass performance killed the series for a time. Thank god there is no Robin, the character is more of a headache than anything else, and we finally get the villianous Scarecrow(portrayed excellently by Cillian Murphy) which has been tossed around for some years now. The whole cast is great, with the exception of Katie Holmes and her sitcom quality acting, I'm glad to hear she won't be back for the sequel. This movie has the best developed Bruce Wayne and still has great action sequences. This movie like other great comic book adaptations(Spiderman 2 and X-Men 2) transcends the genre and is truly a great story and a great movie.
B00004RF9I|5.0|Peter Finch, Faye Dunaway, Willam Holden gave a superb performance because of the best lines they had. The DVD offered a quiz, on who spoke what in the movie, which allowed the audience to recapture part of the fine script.     The movie was successful not because it gave some memorable moments and lines. It was memorable because it was well-balanced in all respects. Thanks to the directing and the script, no one outshined another. No scene was redundant. The  bits and pieces fell in the right places to tell a grippng tale.      The scene where Howard Beale (Peter Finch), as the host of an entirely new show, asked the audience, across the whole country, to open their windows and shouted \\"I'm not going to take this anymore\\" was mesmerising. The director was clever to arrange that people shouted into the void on a dark rainy night.    I was first disappointed to see Mr. Arther Jensen (Ned Beatty) as the top brass of the takeover company. Yet the meeting he had with Howard Beale (Peter Finch) at a dim conference room with his clear and hynotizing voice delivering his philosophy was a master stroke. Howard Beale was practically brain-washed. The whole meeting turned out to be critical - the twist that determined the ultimate destiny of Howard Beale and his show.    I was amazed at how much depth the director and the script could go into in a movie lasting merely 2 hours or so. A movie of the 70s that is made to last with Oscars for Best Actor, Best Actress and Best supporting Actress. Don't miss it.
6304696515|5.0|I won't rehash the whole plot, we all know the story. I'd give this version of Dangerous Liaisons more stars if could. I only have one thing to say. I'm tired of all those people who say  that John Malkovich wasn't handsome enough to play Valmont. Justin Chang from California wrote that he \\"didn't completely buy Malkovich as the charming lady-killer\\" and that casting him in the role was a \\"a small but serious flaw that undermines the whole film\\". Bulls**t! <br /> <br />How could anyone watch Malkovich's stellar performance and think of nothing except looks. Hollywood is so full of \\"good-looking\\" actors and actresses who can't act their way out of a paper bag. In modern times we often value conventional beauty over all other aspects of a person's character. A lot of these Hollywood hunks wish they could act as well as Mr. Malkovich. Get over it, people, no one will ever play Valmont better!
B000002H33|4.0|That is a very good question.  I will attempt to answer it.  This is Metallica's third studio album complete with 8 songs and is tied with Ride the Lightning for their best album.  But when a lot of people, who do not have a metallica album in their possession and feel the need to read up some information about it, they have to decide for themselves, is this album all it's cracked up to be?  Well it is and it isn't.  Just about every song here is beautiful; it almost seems as if you never want most of them to end.  This is also the last album with Cliff Burton (RIP), but I'm sure you have heard about that before you even clicked on this website.   This respectable bassist died when their tour bus got in an accident in Sweden.  His death may have been what lead to the demise of this great metal band.  I advise you do not listen to anything past the black album (even that is so-so).  On an additional note, crank the CD on headphones and you will be able to hear his bass a lot better, but you have to pay attention, he really did a great job.      As I stated, the music here is masterful and genius, yet it also presents its fare share of flaws.  As most people, have pointed out, the track Leper Messiah is somewhat filler.  Lars was NEVER a great drummer, there are so many people who were and are better drummers then him it would be silly to just list a few.  I, myself am a drummer so Drums tend to be very important to me.  The fact is there are only 8 songs, if one is to label an 8 song album to be a classic and 5 star album (as most of the people here have given it) then every song MUST be perfect, well that's my opinion.  The Lyrics to the song Damage, Inc. are absolutely immature (Kind of like Kill `Em All style), but the music for it kills.   This album is rated a solid five stars currently, something that is rather hard to do with 1000 reviews in the amazon.com community.  But if you examine it, it's pretty easy to do when SEVERAL of the reviewers here rate it 2 oreven 3 times!  Some of the songs like The Thing That Should Not Be chug along at 8 minutes and I believe it only has 1 guitar solo, though it is a good song.    The fact is Burton actually only participated in writing 3 of the songs.  I also find the instrumental Orion to be a bit boring and that the instrumental The Call of Ktulu from Ride the Lightning to be far superior in comparison.   I'm sure there are a few other pointers I could give, but nothing comes to mind right now.      The fact is that this album is a classic in its own right.  But it is overrated at the same time.  I listen to this thing maybe once a month and within the same month I'll listen to Slayer's Reign in Blood and Seasons in the Abyss roughly 10 times.  The thing that Made Metallica famous were their Lyrics and Guitar work, yet with the days of St. Anguish, We shall never see that again.  So maybe now the other fact that the real Metallica is extinct, may make some treasure it even more, but at the same time it's also rather depressing, seeing a giant such as this, take such a mighty fall.  But looking back at this time capsule, we can escape to a place that will always be there, a place where Cliff is still alive, a place where we are locked in our homes (Sanitarium) and a place where there is still the threat of Global war (Disposable Heroes).  But even this classic is flawed or overrated.  Pick another word like perfect, mind blowing or even terrible for some and it shall be that in some way.  Should it be in your CD collection?  Yes.  Should it be one of your top favorites?  It's all up to your opinion and taste.  For me, it's great, but is hardly played as much as Arise or Beneath the Remains by Sepultura or almost any Slayer Album.  Hopefully I won't get bashed because I didn't give it 5 stars, but awe well, I took the risk and spoke my mind.  I hoped this helped

B000002U82|5.0|I would just like to suggest to anyone looking at these reviews that they ignore the sudden stream of 1 star reviews from what seems to be the same person, probably in junior high, or with an adolescent mentality, who apparently has decided that an album he dislikes should not have a 5 star rating and has set about posting an infantile series of \\"reviews\\" if I can dignify them as such in a desperate effort to drop it lower.

0671027344|5.0|I finished reading \\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\\" over a month ago and still find myself haunted by it. This was definitely not the reaction I expected to a book published by MTV, but chances are \\"Wallflower\\" is the exception, not the rule. A lot of other reviews would argue that Charlie is incredibly pathetic and whiny, but I think they fail to understand that stems from his depression. The fact that he responds to the events in his life by either crying about it or drawing away from reality - such as going to the mall to figure out \\"why people go there\\" after relations with his best friends, Patrick and Sam, sour - explains the title and the moral of the story, which is that Charlie must stop being a \\"wallflower\\" and has to assert himself if he is to change his own life or the lives of others. <br /> <br />This really isn't another \\"young adult\\" novel, though the content doesn't delve too far past the difficulties of high school and the merits of The Smiths. However, I was skeptical how realistic it was that, within a few weeks of Charlie's entering high school, he became immersed in a world of drugs and sex that he was completely ignorant of before. I think a lot of books aimed at teenagers insist on offering that as an authentic teenage experience when, to be completely honest, there are plenty of young people who don't experiment with drugs or sex. Nonetheless, there are points when \\"Wallflower\\" hits the mark when it comes to a fifteen-year-old boy's sexual development. Charlie's discovery of masturbation would have to be one of my favorite scenes in the book.
B000063DFS|5.0|the person below me, talking about this being generic and that there are a few keepers, please, save that crap for a HOLE album or something like that. this is a great record and has many keepers in it and the sound is fine. Zack and Ozzy have a lot of chemistry and they defintely show it on this album.<br /><br />it starts off with Mr. Tinkertrain, which is a cool ass song, also has the great power ballad Mama I'm Coming Home, followed by Desire, another classic from those days. Then there is the title song No More Tears, Lemmy's Hellraiser turned into gold by Zack on guitar, and has some more good ballads Time After Time and Road To Nowhere etc.. plus other songs that are acceptable.<br /><br />if you liked No Rest For The Wicked, you need this album too, Zack comes in even stonger on this one and it's a lot more mature in chemistry and music wise between the band.
B0000019PA|1.0|This album - and, I might add, virtually anything coming from the incestuous circle of much over-praised Elephant 6 bands - should be  right up the alley of any addled indie-rock nitwits who confuse \\"quirky\\" with \\"quality.\\" <br />It is filled with what otherwise would have been pleasantly bland, aimless songs that are only made somewhat interesting through overwrought arrangements of 'everything but the kitchen sink' instrumentation (and I'm not so sure a kitchen sink or two wasn't thrown in there somewhere). <br />And then there are those lyrics! Those dreadfully awful highschool poetry lyrics...  sheesh... \\"...Standing on the sea-weed water/Semen stains the mountain tops...\\" or \\"While powerful pistons were sugary sweet machines/Smelling of semen all under the garden\\" Oh lord, make it stop. <br />I figure this album should appeal greatly to pretentious and intellectually insecure teenagers who embrace anything they don't readily understand (assuming it has acquired the hipster stamp of approval) as mysterious and brilliant; when, in fact, it might be nothing more than nonsensical gibberish. <br />Okay, so where does that leave us? In fairness, this probably deserves 2, maybe even 3 stars -- there are far worse albums out there. I only gave it 1 (and would have given 0 if I could) as a reality check, in response to all the irrational praise heaped upon it. So give it a listen... judge for yourself... listen to the pretty horns... to the pretty saws... to Mangum's intriguing voice... <br />Try to ignore the inane lyrics... and the fact that you aren't being dazzled with brilliance, but rather baffled with- well, you know how the saying goes. <br />Sorry kids; your King of Carrots isn't wearing any clothes.

B00012FXB8|3.0|In regards to the version that was released in cinemas...miss it. That's for damn sure. This was the first film that David Fincher directed and it has that dark, smelly and grimy look that he is only capable of. After the highly exciting Aliens there is ZERO entertainment here and only one Alien. Very fake looking and largely unseen for most of the movie.<br /><br />Apparently the Alien Queen laid one last face hugger egg on the Marine ship (didn't she already detach herself from her birth tunnel thingy). The egg hatches and lays another Alien egg in Ripley, which just happens to be a queen. For a reason, which is unclear to us, the face hugger sprays acid on the ship, which catches fire and breaks off the cryo-tube section. This sends Ripley, Newt, Hicks and Bishop crashing down onto a lice-infected prison planet called Furiona 161.<br /><br />Just for the hell of it (it seems) Newt, Hicks and Bishop are killed off because the film is deliberately miserable as it possibly can be. Weaver is the only female character in it and is very much indistinctive among the rest of the indistinctive cast as she is bald-headed (because of the Lice problem) with a bunch of bald-headed guys who all appear to be English and ugly.<br /><br />There is another face hugger (so the Queen laid 2 eggs before it died?) that the prisoners seem to miss as they rescue Ripley. It impregnates a dog and a new Alien is born in the form of a canine, giving us the impression that the beast mimics the form of the creature that became its host. We are supposed to observe this as it is never cleared up in dialogue.<br /><br />There are numerous scenes in which Ripley (or bald-headed prisoners...I can't tell) run down damp corridors (or perhaps the same one over and over) being chased by the Alien. But for budget reasons we don't actually SEE the Alien, just its point of vision. Characters are killed with no care, passion or meaning to their deaths and how the hell anyone believed that an audience of any kind would enjoy this film is beyond my great understanding.<br /><br />It is so bad that Fincher didn't get work for 3 years after this until he was called upon to direct Se7en. The only reason he got to do that is because it is a depressing and ugly film, much like this.<br /><br />The extended version featured on the Special Edition DVD is a far superior version of the film, though not a director's cut or without faults, it's the best version of the film you're likely to see. With an extra 30 minutes characters are fleshed out, sense-making scenes are restored and the creature is born out of a dead ox instead of a dog. It doesn't sound like much but it almost changes it into a completely new and more satisfying film.<br /><br />Both versions feature a great 2.35:1 anamorphic picture and Dolby 5.1 sound. There are loads of extras to keep you happy, but the still bitter Fincher is nowhere to be seen.nce of any kind would enjoy this film is beyond my great understanding. <br /> <br />It is so bad that Fincher didn't get work for 3 years after this until he was called upon to direct Se7en.

B0007Y4USW|1.0|The computer-generated instrumentation just doesn't do Mariah Carey's voice justice here.  Every song sounds like the one next to it with a different button pushed.<br /><br />It's a sad state of affairs when a mediocre song like \\"We Belong Together\\" (whatever remix) is number one for 10 weeks.  What does that say about the rest of the chart?<br /><br />Clearly, she has to get a new producer and get away from this paint-by-the-numbers over-researched style and get into music that has wider appeal but with sales as they are, that obviously won't happen.  Another victory for the almighty dollar.<br /><br />Maybe even use real instruments and have guest singers who actually have talent.<br /><br />Oh, and Mariah, lose the phony bronze skin color and the front-end augmentation.  You don't need it.
0451205766|5.0|I have had \\"The Godfather\\" on my shelf for about a year now but only just got around to reading it. I must say I was not prepared with the force with which Mario Puzo's storytelling leapt off the page and grabbed me. I have seen the film, of course - everyone should - but the book contains the details, sub-plots and first-person perspectives that no film can match. Puzo's narrative voice is cool but forceful, and full of dry irony. It's compulsively readable, I literally had to force myself to put it down!  Highly recommended. <br /> <br />However, I do want to warn readers away from the over-priced New American Library version - the trade paperback in a red foil cover with \\"The Original Classic\\" at the top. This edition is littered with typos, many of them errors that a simple spell-checking program would have caught. It's very distracting and annoying. Penguin should be ashamed to peddle such shoddy merchandise.  Get the mass-market paperback instead; the black cover is more sinister, anyway.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|As Jerry said before me, Joe Walsh is great and this is a great showcase for him.  Aside from it being a great performance, the more remarkable thing is they seem to be having fun together, especially the way Glen and Joe play off each other, but all seem to be lighter and enjoying themselves, something that goes against the previously reported acrimony among them ( re: the 'Hell Freezes Over' theme from the past).  Having seen Joe and Glen in the past, this is as close to being there as you can probably get.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|Seriously, what copy protection?  I bought this CD the day it came out, and immediately ripped it to mp3 with Musicmatch.  From there, into iTunes, and onto my iPod mini.  No fuss, no muss, I passed go and collected my $12 of music.  I don't even remember there being a problem!  And as far as all of the people reviewing it saying to boycott it because of the copy protection, aren't there better things to boycott right now, like OIL, or something?  Come on, I remember Dave Grohl on Dennis Miller Live about 4 or 5 years ago, when Metallica and Lars Ulrich were fighting Napster, saying that \\"if you're a millionaire artist, and you're complaining about pennies, f you, man.\\" <br /> <br />Somehow I doubt it was a concern of the band's that this CD be copy protected.  I'm sure they've all got plenty of money, and are just happy that there are millions of fans who are willing to pay for something they created.  Sony, on the other hand, well, they need all the money they can get right now.  Losing $50-$100 on each PS3 is going to add up. <br /> <br />So anyway, what was this review about?  Oh yeah, THE MUSIC.  All I can say is that I love the first disc so much, I've barely even listened to the second disc.  My favorite is track 10, \\"End over End,\\" which gets stuck in my head at least once  a day.  As far as I'm concerned, this is just an evolution of the Foo Fighters.  There's bits and pieces of each of their other CDs here, melded with just enough new stuff to make it interesting instead of boring.  If you have One By One or There Is Nothing Left To Lose, you're going to want this one.
B0000DJZB9|4.0|I love GN'R and this is a great collection of videos but it is missing \\"You Could Be Mine.\\" That is a great GN'R song and video. All in all this was a great collection of their videos and I'm happy with my purchase.
B000AARKOO|5.0|I saw the movie three times in the theater. I love it. It's one of my favorites movies of all time. The script is brilliant. Also the music and effects are amazing. <br />ORLANDO BLOOM as Balian is excellent. He shows that he can handle to play the leading role. You always know what he thinks even if he does not speak. <br />The movie has also other famous stars. JEREMY IRONS as Tiberias is playing his character by heard. He gives such an impressive performance (like he does always). <br />LIAM NEESON as the father of Balian is very short in the movie but gives a good performance. <br />EDWARD NORTON as the king and MARTON CSOKAS as Guy de Lusignan are also amazing. <br />I think this movie is a little bit better than \\"Gladiator\\". It has a lot of touching scenes. If you cry sometimes at movies you will cry at this movie.  <br />I can not really understand why the critics didn't like it. I think it's a REALLY good movie.  <br />I think RIDLEY SCOTT is a brilliant director. He makes so many good movies. <br />Watch it if you have not seen it and DO NOT listen to the critics!!!!!!!!!! <br />
B0002O06N0|4.0|The Black Keys are Patrick Carney and Dan Auerbach, an emo-looking band from Akron, Ohio. However, the duo is definitey classic rock and blues, not emo.<br /><br />Many of the songs are feel-good melodies to rock out to. Rubber Factory is great driving music. \\"When The Lights Go Out\\" surges with a bad ass attitude and great lyrics. When the songs start sounding the same, they begin to differentiate themselves from each other with more bluesy traces or country sounds. The song \\"Stack Shot Billy\\" sounds startlingly familiar to Moby's gospel and blues influenced \\"Natural Blues;\\" it is questionable whether this was on purpose.<br /><br />Standout tracks are \\"All Hands Against His Own,\\" a song with great lyrics to find yourself tapping your toes and nodding your head to, and \\"The Lengths,\\" which is a ballady, powerful, and different song.<br /><br />The CD ends without a bang, which could be considered a pitfall, but is actually an admirable part of the album. Instead of waiting to impress or instead of betraying the laid-back attitude of the rest of the CD, it ends casually.<br /><br />Not all of the lyrics are included in the booklet. \\"The Desperate Man\\" only has a partial entry and \\"Grown So Ugly\\" and Act Nice and Gentle\\" have none. Also, the lyrics are not in order in the booklet which makes them slightly difficult to follow.
0064431789|5.0|This book is fantastic and a favorite of my kids.  We love it.<br /><br />One suggestion - if your kids are rough on books like mine are, buy the paperback version for the playroom and a hardcover to keep nice.  I did this and I'm so glad I did.  I don't cringe as much when they get rough with the paperback as I do with the hard cover.  Yes - books are meant to be read, but I like keeping one copy nice (my hardcover) for reading before bedtime in their rooms.<br /><br />Enjoy the book.  This is one purchase you won't regret.
B000002JOH|5.0|Ok, im not saying dimebag is the best guitar player ever, but this guy comes up with the greatest riffs and combinations of notes of any album besides metallicas MOP and AJFA. stfu no met. didnt make better riffs, they made just as good ones just faster. dimebag made heavy riffs.Also, i think this is the greatest album in terms of sheer manliness, it sounds like they took pure testosterone and injected it into their guitars and amps and bodies and cds and recording equipment. If anyone out there likes metal and cool riffs to bang (or nod if ur at home) to, i seriously suggest checking out this album, especially songs 1-11, they kick the most ass. IF UR EVEN LOOKING AT THIS REVIEW GET THIS ALBUM BELIEVE ME PANTERA KICKS ASS
B00005MAM2|1.0|It just makes it old, and retarded looking. Ok when I first got into Neon Genesis Evangelion half a year ago, I wanted to buy the best anime on par with Neon genesis and I heard this was an classic movie and was great. So I bought it and watched it and I was embarassed. The age of the movie shows so bad in this one. Like Nausicaa and the valley of the wind was a 1980s movie, but it took place in a fantasy world so It didn't look old. but this movie takes place in the city so it looks too crappy. Let me explain what I mean. Ok those little kids with the blue skin look like something from a 1980 animated show like thundercats or something. It's not the anime I know and love. just look at the anime in Neon Genesis or Elfen Lied. It's bright and the girls are hot and it just looks plain cool! but this animation looks retarded in my oppinion. like come on the girl in this movie, Kai, looks like a guy. There is just something I can't stand. like how the main character has a big picture of a capsule on the back of his jacket. like why would you wear something like that?? Is he like 3 years old?? Stuff like that just bugs me to no end. like Tetsuo looked AWESOME with his red cape on and his metal arm, fighting the army. but that was the only thing I liked in the movie. The story also, is very confusing. Neon Genesis is just as confusing but NOT this bad! I am so lost at the end of this movie!  I don't even know why this movie is called anime, it doesn't look like anime. It looks like crappy 1980 american crap animation. Go watch Neon Genesis or Excel Saga or Ghost in the shell or Elfen Lied to see what anime (adult animation) should look like. Not this kiddy looking animation. I bought this movie, like I said, and I actually threw it in my garbage. Maybe someone who likes bad movies will find it at the dump and love it.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|This Is a fantastic movie that freaked the MPAA out when it hit theatres in 2000. It was originally rated NC-17, and We still dunno wether it's R- rated of NC-17! Though I saw the R rated one, I still liked it.<br /><br />STORY: Sara Goldfarb (Burstyn) is a widow, who has a son named Harry. He has 2 friends, Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) and Marion (Jennifer Connelly). They all get hooked on such drugs as Marijuanna, Cocaine, Heroin, etc. to start a new life. Meanwhile, Sara gets a call one day from an informercial Guru named Tappy Tibbons, and so She tries a diet which you can't have Red Meat, Preserved sugar, and Orgasms. But then \\"no\\"'s drive her crazy so she contacts a doctor,and gets addicted to dieting pills. But then, these people's addictions start to destroy their lives...<br /><br />THOUGHTS: KEEP AWAY FROM THE YOUNG CHILDREN! It contains sexual scenes that don't apply \\"good\\" for ages 10-17. But then again, This is an IMPORTANT FILM, and should it be shown to every friggin' JH ans SH school kid? YES. It will show you what drugs can do to you.<br /><br />So I'm hoping that you will buy this movie. It will mess with your head for a little, then it will make you realise that DRUGS KILL! SO PLEASE BUY IT!!!

0441003257|4.0|I really hate that the cover of my book touted \\"Good Omens\\" as being on par with the superior \\"Hitchhiker's Guide\\" books (Douglas Adams) because those are treasures that will end up in the annals of classic literature some day. And while this is a great book, it does not hold a candle to Adams.<br /><br />I will say it again, though ... \\"Good Omens\\" is a great read. It captures a fine blend of seriousness and laugh-out-loud situations. There are so many great quirks, from a demon who has come to love the Earth a little too much, to prophet Agnes Nutter's offbeat (and mostly accurate) foretellings, you'll find yourself laughing a lot. And it has the best ending to ANY book I have EVER read. Hands down outstanding on the end.<br /><br />A few minor quibbles, such as a few mishandled characters and some muddling of the plot at times. It's nothing that should keep you from reading this book, however. If you like Science Fiction or Comedies, this is a wonderful mix of both genres.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|This may be the Foo Fighters' last ever album...and if it is, it's a GREAT ending! Having two discs, one electric/hard rock and one acoustic, is an awesome idea. I'm not that big a fan of the acoustic CD, but the first CD is so good it more than makes up for it! <br /> <br />Standouts: In Your Honor (a great start!), No Way Back, The Last Song, DOA, Resolve, On The Mend, End Over End.  <br /> <br />Overall, this album is great to showcase Grohl and the others' talents and they are all total legends! Can't wait for their Australian In Your Honor tour in December this year!

B000001F3C|5.0|...to this album! As a young Kiwi I'd loved \\"I Will Follow\\" and \\"Gloria\\", but this album was a step beyond those early, determinedly modern forays. There is a lot more passion here - the political and spiritual awareness that later somehow transposed into the stale activism and preachy dreck of \\"Rattle & Hum\\" (thanks goodness they woke up and brought out ACHTUNG BABY). Although personally I rate THE UNFORGETTABLE FIRE a bit higher than this its not by much...there are so many magnificent songs here! My personal favourites are \\"New Years Day\\" and \\"Two Hearts\\" (great singles, cold and wintry), \\"Seconds\\" - the Edge sounds unsettlingly like Bono here, and the music is dark and menacing, \\"Drowning Man\\" a passionate, Celtic-inflected ballad and \\"Surrender\\" a searing, soaring piece of late night-urban angst that collapses into the gentle summer morning, the quiet optimism of grace that is \\"40\\". <br />Although they have done many good things (and some not-so-good) since, this album and its immediate successor remain, for me, the peak of their achievement. Perhaps its because the Cold War background and threat of nuclear apocalypse fitted so nicely into the band's Christian eschatology...or maybe I was just at the right age and this review is hopelessly nostalgic. Either way, check it out. Its good.
B000002G85|4.0|Eric Clapton is surrounded by a cornucopia of musicians and vocalist on this his first solo album. <br />Delaney and Bonnie Bramlett, Stephen Stills, Rita Coolidge, Bobby Whitlock, Jim Gordon, Carl Radle, Leon Russell and several more lend a hand or two, and Clapton has co-written about half of the album's eleven songs with Bonnie Bramlett, the half-decent instrumental \\"Slunky\\" and the fine blues-rock numbers \\"Bad Boy\\" and \\"Bottle Of Red Wine\\" among them. <br /> <br />There is perhaps a little less pop-rock and a little more blues-rock here than on most of Clapton's seventies solo albums, and many of the songs that were to become concert standarts throughout the decade came from this album: Clapton's rendition of J.J. Cale's \\"After Midnight\\", the sturdy rockers \\"Blues Power\\" and \\"Bottle Of Red Wine\\" and the grand \\"Let It Rain\\".  <br />Eric Clapton could have let loose a bit more when he recorded the vocals, and fans of his guitar hero persona may feel that he should have soloed a bit more and with a bit more reckless abandon, but this eponymous 37-minute album is nevertheless a nice, cohesive listen with plenty of highlights and precious few let-downs...a \\"cozy\\" album, and a sign of things to come as far as what Clapton's 70s solo career would bring. <br /> <br />\\"Eric Clapton\\" is not one of Clapton's better-known solo albums, but it has several good melodies and a lot of excellent musicanship, and while it doesn't reach the hights of \\"Layla\\" or \\"From The Cradle\\" it is definitely one of Clapton's better efforts.
0743455967|5.0|Another hit for Mr. King!  Very informative and interesting.  Good points were brought out on writing. <br />A must read for all who has writing in their heart.
B000003S1A|5.0|if you pick up this album, take the effort to totally step out of the sound and image of the band's legendary first album. this is not the court of the crimson king (and if that's the basis of your interest in this album, you're bound to be disappointed), but it is great music in its own right.    in contrast to the operatic prog bombast and moodiness of the first album, discipline is a totally different cup of tea inspired by images of africa and dominated by guitar wizard adrian belew fresh from his outings with talking heads/brian eno - the remarkable 'remain in light' - and heavily influenced by david bryne's vocal delivery, which itself is the exact opposite of the melancholy magnificence of greg lake's vocals in tcotck. fripp apparently wanted to call the band itself \\"discipline\\", but somehow the tag of \\"king crimson\\" was retained. soulful ballads interspersed with manic funk, layered with sinuous lead guitar duels, courtesy fripp and belew, characterises this album. bill bruford's \\"batterie\\", as subtle and powerful as ever, and tony levin's funky exploring bass, form the formidable rhythym section for the axemen to work on. fripp is still the brain behind the scenes, guiding and directing and his evolution as a musician/producer influenced by brain eno, is marked here. elephant talk, matte kudasai, the hilarious indiscipline, the sheltering sky are the highlights in this album. this album is as unique as it gets - never heard anything like this before or after!
B000002UAU|5.0|The best Beatles album I own so far. It's just flat out a great album. It starts off with the awesome \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" and pulls you in for the rest of the album. <br />     The only, \\"not so great song\\" here is \\"Within Without You\\", one of George's many Indian songs, which I am not a fan of. But the rest is pure genious. I highly reccomend because it is a great album and I believe it's the cheapest you can buy new. One of the greater concept albums of all time. Peace.
B000067CPX|5.0|Yeah, OK, \\"maturing\\" is a bit of a dirty word - not one you might like to see associated with the Chilis, but I just can't think of a better one.  <br />Like many people, I was enraptured by the energy of the early Chilis - and perhaps like many others, I was a little disappointed with thier work after Mothers Milk. But not, I suspect, for the same reasons as many. <br />It wasn't that I felt the Chilis were selling out on cuts like \\"BloodSugarSexMagik\\" - I felt that they just weren't going far enough! Adolescent sexual energy is all very well, but after a while gets a little boring. I lost interest in this band that wasn't rekindled until I heard \\"Scar Tissue\\", which I felt showed increasing depth and adventure. I am glad (yes there is a point to all this preamble) to see that direction and energy maintained on \\"By The Way\\". The lyrics are not so goofy, in fact very acute. The musicianship is a lot more understated, which is great. i used to love hearing Frusciante's and Flea's virtuosity, but on this album they prove that understatement has as much - if not more - power than flash and glitter! And Anthony Kiedis' singing is constantly improving. <br />All the tracks are great, although the best for me are \\"This Is The Place\\" - a menacing piece where Kiedis basically rips his heart out and offers it warts and all for our perusal - \\"Don't Forget Me\\", where the menace gets even more menacing, with some of the darkest and broodiest poetry I've heard in a while, \\"Midnight\\" - great chorus - \\"Minor Thing\\", which simply soars at the end and the rousing, superb closer \\"Venice Queen\\", a lament that pulses with restrained energy and power. Restraint is the key word for this album. Sometimes less is more.
B0009HLDFU|1.0|My car CD player is only a couple years old, and this CD won't play in it. Plays other discs just fine. I think it's because of the copy protection. And how does that help me? The copy protection does *nothing* to improve the listening experience or enhance compatibility of the disc.  <br /> <br />What a waste. Why are customers treated like the enemy? That's a great marketing plan they've got.
0312935080|4.0|Four years prior Harry Bosch was forced to shoot the infamous Dollmaker, serial killer who painted each victim with her own makeup. Harry was disciplined by his own department for his \\"cowboy\\" approach on the apprehension, but now he is standing trial in a civil suit by the surviving wife for use of excessive force. Not only is he facing tough female attorney \\"Money\\" Chandler, but a body, a \\"concrete blonde,\\" has just been found buried in concrete with the same MO used by the Dollmaker. Did Harry kill the wrong man?<br /><br />This story proceeds on two fronts: the courtroom and an intense LAPD investigation into the impossibility of a dead man committing another murder. From the court proceedings, Harry realizes that a Follower has been copying the Dollmaker even before the shooting. But only an insider could have exactly duplicated the Dollmaker's crime scenes. Harry must now proceed cautiously in not falsely targeting a fellow associate, yet quickly as it becomes clear that Follower will strike soon. The tale is gripping and well-constructed with any number of twists that fit well in the story line. Of interest is Harry's delicate relationship with police widow Sylvia Moore.<br /><br />The Harry Bosch series delivers and shows no sign of a let down.
B0007TKNIS|5.0|BETTER than Broadway!! Gerard Butler is amazing! I truly watched this due to the buzz about Emmy Rossum. But, oh! What a treat it was to see Gerard Butler as Phantom. His presence, his natural grace, his incredible movements. His vocal talents abounded with each song! How he conveyed his pain! My heart broke for him over and over! I suffered with his every anguish! He was so able to draw you in to the emotion of the character! If you didn't sob your heart out for him, with him, check and make sure you have one!!!Another Sir Richard Harris in the making! p.s. Surround sound is the best way to watch this!
B000001FA4|5.0|This one comes in slightly ahead of WAR for me (I'd rate ACHTUNG BABY 3rd, if pressed). Although I believe WAR to be a more coherent offering, the aura of experiment surrounding this cut is key to its strengths and weaknesses. <br />\\"A Sort of Homecoming\\" is a brilliant opener, with remarkable imagery in the lyrics, viz. <br /> <br />-The wind will crack <br />in winter time <br />this bomb blast lightning waltz <br />No spoken words, just a scream <br /> <br />or, <br /> <br />-See faces plowed like fields <br />that once gave no resistance <br /> <br />Wow - Bono certainly has his banal moments, but this is most definitely not one of them. The music is a summery haze of guitars (Eno is clearly evident here) and the vocal delivery passionate and sincere. <br />The next track \\"Pride (In the Name of Love)\\" is actually my least favourite on the album - although I think it rather good anyway, and, as it is very well-known, I'll move on. \\"Wire\\" the next track is simply the nastiest and most vicious piece U2 have ever done. It is, I understand, about addiction, and, with its dark imagery, odd, disconnected vocal lines and very chthonic rhythm, it is the best - in aesthetic terms - the best song they've done. <br />\\"The Unforgettable Fire\\" is a great song too, with Bono reaching new heights as a vocalist on the bridge (although check out his collaboration with Clannad, \\"In A Lifetime\\", recorded around this time). \\"Promenade\\" is nice, cathartic and light after the violence and power of what has come before, and the summer ennui of that piece carries over into \\"4th July\\" and the beginning of \\"Bad\\" - a song that is the precursor to U2's stadium/epic identity, but for all that, not too shabby. <br />\\"Indian Summer Sky\\" is OK, like \\"Wire\\" but without the malevolence and self-loathing that drive that song. \\"Elvis Presley & America\\" I really love - its a sloppy, meandering piece with incomprehensible vocals, but its half-finished feel is what gives it its charm. <br />\\"MLK\\" is apiece of beauty: a lullaby atop Eno's lush keyboards, a truly gentle way to end an album dedicated to the spirit of exploration and growth...this CD is a piece of flawed magic.

B000A2GS54|4.0|Well, it's about time Manchester got a revival -- it's been around fifteen years since bands like the Happy Mondays and Stone Roses erupted onto the music scene. Now with late-70s and mid-80s music being revived in newer, trendier bands, it's about time we got to England in the late-80s and mid-90s.<br /><br />Enter Kasabian, a Leicester band who put out catchy, synthy, and extremely entertaining rock'n'roll. What does their self-titled album sound like? Well, it has some echoes of those Manchester greats, except that it has a synth edge over those heavy riffs. Add in some very radio-friendly melodies, which are almost guaranteed to get these guys noticed by the media.<br /><br />Not that that's a bad thing -- they resemble fellow electro-Manchester band South, which happens to be among my favorite Britpop bands. Kasabian is just lighter. They kick things off on a strong note with the expansive \\"Clubb Foot,\\" which pairs gritty rock with sweeping synth, over Tom Meighan's languid vocals.<br /><br />Fortunately this is not one of those albums that has one good single, and then gets lazy. Things stay catchy and gritty, all throughout the album, with heavy riffs and steady rhythms, and Kasabian keep their style varied enough that listeners won't be left thinking, \\"Oh man, are they playing that riff AGAIN?\\"<br /><br />Not to mention the singing: Meighan has a very strong, melodious voice. In almost every song, he sings slow and lazily. He sounds either stoned or inattentive, except for a few wonderful songs where he sounds completely into what he sings. \\"John was a scientist, he was hooked on LSD/Interested in mind control and how the monkey held the key/Said that all life is experiments somebody's planning for the heir/It's for the unexpected citizens who hallucinate in fear,\\" he purrs happily.<br /><br />Yeah, it can get pretty heavy. but the music is also tempered with an ethereal edge -- there's a brief interlude which is all muffled riffs, deep synth and angelic vocals. At the very least, all that synth serves to lighten up what could have been a dark album, and adds an epic edge to what could have been terribly ordinary music.<br /><br />The flaw? It gets a bit fragmented, with two peppy electronic \\"interludes\\" sitting between harder rock'n'roll. They're pretty, but they feel out of place.<br /><br />Things climax with hints of another possible direction for them to go in: \\"U Boat,\\" a rich soundscape that fades away into silence... before fading back into a different mix of \\"Reason is Treason.\\" It's all hard angles and explosions, and if anything, this mix is even better than the radio-friendly original. (Talk about having your cake and eating it too)<br /><br />One of the few albums that is catchy and musically rich, Kasabian's debut is one of the best releases this year. It's reminiscent of Britpop greats, but somehow that doesn't matter -- they're original enough to have their own fun sound.ynth and angelic vocals.

B00000294R|5.0|Big L has a lyrical talent that i would compare to (although they both have unique styles) that of Inspectah Deck. The way L puts words together is like nothing else he hits you with punch lines that will knock you out \\"I wasn't poor I was po, couldn't afford the o.r.\\" to me that's very well thought out. I found that every song deserved a ten on this album although production fell of a little at times but with rhymes like L's you don't even need production.
B00025ETIW|5.0|Four months ago, I saw the music video for Helena. I became an addict. I found myself waiting and hoping that it would come on the TV. After a while, I just decided to buy the album instead. I listened to it and found myself singing along after the first listen. Although some of the lyrics can be hard to understand, especially on Give 'em Hell, Kid, the beat is irresistible! You will find yourself dancing to their music, even if you usually don't dance! The fast-paced feel of the album is complemented nicely by the softer Interlude, which provides a nice break from all the \\"rockin'\\". There is not one song on \\"Three Cheers\\" that is anything less than magnificent. A great buy!

B00008XEOI|5.0|Considered by many to be the best Disney movie ever, the 1994 animated masterpiece \\"The Lion King\\" has finally hit dvd. The last truly great animated Disney feature before the studio reinvented itself as computer animated heaven with \\"Toy Story\\", \\"The Lion King\\" has been given one of the best treatments of any dvd.<br /><br />I will not bore you with plot details. Since this is Disney's highest grossing movie (last time I checked), odds you all have seen this movie. I will tell you that the film has gotten the respect it deserves. This dvd is loaded to the hilt with extras. There is a brand new song in the movie (\\"Morning Report\\"), music videos for the Elton John penned classics \\"Can You Feel The Love Tonight\\" (performed by Sir Elton himslef) and \\"Circle Of Life\\" (performed by the Disney Channell \\"Circle Of Stars\\"), making of documenatries and much more. The sound and picture quality are virtually flawless. It looks and sounds better than in a movie theater.<br /><br />This Special Edition boxed set of the movie comes with a book chronicling the making of the movies as well as sketches of all of the movie's principal characters. While interesting to look at, all you really need is the movie, a Disney classic.<br /><br />(And for all you conspiracy theorists looking for subliminal messages in Disney movies, I have one for you. In the scene where Simba looks below the mountain where Mufasa has been killed, a cloud of smoke rises. Pause it at the right moment and if you look closely enough, you can see the word sex spelled out in the smoke).
B000002UDB|5.0|if you're going for historical accuracy, then you'll want to read this. The original \\"Magical Mystery Tour,\\" was a double-EP with the following song order: <br /> <br />1. Magical Mystery Tour <br />2. Your Mother Should Know <br />3. I Am the Walrus <br />4. Fool on the Hill <br />5. Flying <br />6. Blue Jay Way <br /> <br />The remainder of the songs was issued as follows: <br /> <br />- Hello, Goodbye: A-Side of Hello, Goodbye/I Am the Walrus 45 <br />- Penny Lane: A-Side of Penny Lane/Strawberry Fields Forever 45 <br />- Strawberry Fields Forever: B-Side of Penny Lane/Strawberry Fields Forever 45 <br />- Baby, You're A Rich Man: B-Side of All You Need Is Love/Baby, You're A Rich Man 45 <br />- All You Need Is Love: A-Side of All You Need Is Love/Baby, You're A Rich Man 45 <br /> <br />This is easy to correct if you have iTunes, or other music player/editor programs.

B0009HLDFU|1.0|You would think that in this day and age that musicians and record companies would adopt to the new standards instead of trying to vear music enthusiasts away from file sharing. For the most part, file sharers are not downloading thousands of songs for free; they are usually sampling songs before they go out and buy the CD or a related CD (genre, band, etc.). I wish that sony/bmg would get off their high horse and realize that iPods are hear to stay and that Mac fans deserve a break in the music scene. Mac's should be able to play the CD and you should and do have the right to copy the songs. Therefore sony/bmg are taking away the users rights to copy songs to their iPods by not being mac compatible.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|The most important movie in Disney history, this 1937 gem has gotten a superb dvd treatment. Words cannot describe how flawless this dvd is. It is the best treatment I have ever seen on any dvd. I will not bore you with plot details, as everybody knows what this film is all about. I will say, however, that the film looks and sounds great. They also loaded it with extras. Dozens of documentaries, interviews and much more are littered throughout this magical I wish I could say more, but my praise for this dvd cannot be expressed in mere words. In order to see what I mean, you have to buy the dvd for yourself and see how great it is. And of course, watch the film, too. It remains a classic.
0800177177|5.0|I genuinely enjoyed watching this movie - great costumes and beautifully filmed - a real eye feast.  I supect however many people are seduced, along with Mina, by Oldman's incredibly sexy portrayal of Dracula - and are equally irritated by the bad accent and ordinary acting of Keanu Reeves and Winona Ryder in their respective roles (they've both done much better).  Don't watch it expecting a faithful interpretation of the novel, or if you're wanting a truly scary experience.  It's a bit of fun - even camp in places, but it's pacey, sexy and Oldman's acting (along with Hopkins) is, as always, worth the movie experience alone!

B000000OAN|5.0|While progressive rockers may have been the first to provide significant injections of bombast into rock music, Queen raised bombast to a fine art, and created one of the greatest rock albums in the process of doing so.  Though there is bombast, there is beauty too, and Queen proved that a rock album could incorporate a huge diversity of styles and be successful.  This album is a critical component of any rock music collection.<br /><br />The album opens with the first of three rockers, \\"Death on Two Legs.\\"  This song has excellent metal poetry that eschews mumbled and garbled lyrics for clarity and evocation.  The words contain gems from beginning to end, such as the line \\"you're a sewer-rate decaying in a cesspool of pride.\\"  Guitars scream and wail and Queen's harmonies are sprinkled liberally throughout.  Yet this song retains an element of fun and retains a twinkle in its musical eye.  The other heavy rocker is an ode to muscle cars.  \\"I'm in Love with My Car\\" is a perfect cruising song with crunchy guitars and Roger Taylor's roaring vocal.  The two songs are different, but anchor one end of Queen's musical range.  Also included is a 1991 remix of this song.  There are a few differences between the songs, but I think I still prefer the original.  The third rocker is \\"Sweet Lady.\\"  This third song is loud and fast paced, but seems less inspired than much of the music on this album.<br /><br />After \\"Death on Two Legs\\" is the first of three songs that are quirky, fun and kind of clear the aural palate between songs.  \\"Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon\\" is an ode to the era of flappers and speakeasies.  \\"Seaside Rendezvous\\" is in a similar vein, and also comes after a rocker.  Roger Taylor and Freddie Mercury both do vocal interpretations of instruments that are remarkably effective and fun.  The third song in this vein is \\"Good Company,\\" which comes after \\"Love of My Life.\\"  This song has lead vocals by Brian May, along with a ukulele.  This song has a musical style more similar to songs of the 1930s, though with sufficient electronic effects to remind you that the song is influenced by that era but could only have been made in this era.  For reasons I am unable to explain this song is a perfect lead-in to \\"Bohemian Rhapsody.\\"<br /><br />\\"You're My Best Friend\\" and \\"Love of My Life\\" are two love ballads that show yet another capability of Queen.  \\"You're My Best Friend\\" was released as a single backed by the interesting song \\"'39\\" and reached #16 on the pop singles chart.  Freddie Mercury's vocals provide the emotional kick for this song, and make this song one of Queen's best.  \\"Love of My Life\\" falls into a similar vein, and features Brian May playing the harp.  This song is also beautiful and emotional, and in many ways is more powerful than \\"Love of My Life.\\"  In retrospect, I think this song could have been released as a single and would have done well.  This version of the CD includes a 1991 remix of \\"You're My Best Friend.\\"  I am unable to discern any significant difference between the two versions, and thus the addition is of minimal value.<br /><br />There is one song that is hard to categorize.  \\"God Save the Queen\\" is Brian May's interpretation of the English anthem.  Guitars predominate in this brief piece that somehow is a thank you to the Queen and country.<br /><br />Though the remaining three songs are quite different from each other, they share a commonality in that they are among the more experimental tracks on this CD, and being a fan of progressive rock, I think they are among the best tracks on this CD.<br /><br />The first of these songs is \\"'39.\\"  I have seen many interpretations of this song that combines a flavor of country-rock with several other styles to make a totally unique song.  I saw one review compare the style to Paul McCartney, and I see the relationship.  I could also see a comparison to the Eagle's Joe Walsh years.  The harmonies also remind me just a little of the Moody Blues.<br /><br />The next song in this category is \\"The Prophet's Song,\\" an 8:21 progressive rock masterpiece.  Brian May uses a toy koto, an unusual instrument that lends a slight Asian flavor to the introduction.  This song also features an a capella vocal by Freddie Mercury that is fascinating and adds to the numerous dimensions of this song that features a rocking end.<br /><br />The third song is the bombastic art rock classic \\"Bohemian Rhapsody.\\"  This phenomenal song can be treated as a parody of glam rock, or it can be considered in the context of a rock group that was unafraid of performing their art as they saw fit.  The pseudo operatic elements are wonderful and occasionally eerie and always fascinating.  The harmonies are outstanding and wonderfully excessive.  If ever a song captured everything good about rock music, this one is it.  This song charted the first time in 1976 and reached #9.  The second time the song charted was in 1992, when it reached #2.  You will have some kind of feeling about this song regardless of whether that reaction is one of awe or distaste, but those us who are fans of Queen and progressive rock usually love this one.<br /><br />Queen hit pay dirt with this album, which reached #4 on the Pop Albums chart.  This album was easily Queen's best album, showcasing the talents of four individuals who were able to able to come together and stay together until Freddie Mercury passed away.  While Queen had many excellent songs, they had at least one great album, and this was it.br /> <br />The next song in this category is \\"The Prophet's Song,\\" an 8:21 progressive rock masterpiece.

I was one of the first people who bought it. And I have to say that this is the best System of a Down CD ever! Some songs are short, but every song on this CD is amazing. This CD is System of a Down at their best. It shows their true ability. All the songs blew me away. Although there is one thing I do not get at all. And that is, why are people living in million dollar houses complaining about the president sending the poor? It doesn't make that much since, but then again what does these days? It is still an awesome song. Radio/Vedio, cigaro, old school hollwood... Oh who am I kidding? Every song on this CD is amazing. An all killer no filler CD. If I did have to pick my fav song I do beilive that it would be Old School Hollwood.

B00006879E|1.0|Okay first of all the CD is called \\"Songs about Jane\\" So what do you think all the songs are going to be about? JANE! That's it. It's all about Jane. They could have atleast done a good job of it, like Hawthorne Hieghts did with \\"The silence in black and white\\". They made songs about one girl good. But Maroon5 is the opposite. Why in the world am I comparing Maroon 5 to Hawthorne Heights? They are totally different in every way!In the section \\"People who bought this title also bought...\\" They have listed Kelly Clarkson. And I have to say Kelly Clarkson is more of a rock band than Maroon5 will ever be.
B00005AQE8|5.0|...The country that is the birthplace of many types of music such as gospel (well...maybe this is coming from Africa), jazz, blues, r&b and also... rap! <br />  <br />If you are more into rock, or jazz, or pop, etc,  and you are just curious to discover \\"what' s all this noise about this 2 Pac , that gangsta rapper..\\" then just STOP READING AND GO TO THE NEAREST MUSIC STORE TO BUY THIS ALBUM .  <br /> <br />Let me tell u what happened to me when i did that. When i listened to the album for the first time i found it \\"difficult\\". It was my first Pac album and i was not familiar with his new style in my ears. Well, i listened for the second time one month later, and i could not believe how much i started to like the album. <br /> <br />After that......  9 years have passed, and right now, while typing,  i am listening to \\" All Eyez On Him \\" for the 481st time :-))    <br /> <br />My dear friends , if you don't have this album , go buy it , and feel welcome to the world of 2 PAC SHAKUR, there is never going to be any other like him, everybody knows that, only some do not want to admit it. <br /> <br />It is incredible so many good songs in one album. If you dont like it a lot the first time, just listen again and again. Amazing!!  What a voice!  <br /> <br />I think it was his voice, it is amazing , so deep , so emotional, plus such nice flow, and his lyrics... he made you believe what he said was real. How can you listen to the modern day crap after Pac's music?   <br /> <br />No need to carry the remote control with you, you will not want to skip any song !!  <br /> <br />If a guy from Greece tell you so , then you have to check it out. And this is because i am 100% unprejudiced.  <br /> <br />East Coast has good and bad rappers,  <br />West Coast has good and bad rappers, and had 2 Pac who can not be categorised, pac is on the top of the pyramid, higher than anybody will ever get.  <br />U JUST CAN' SEE HIM NOW... HE IS HAVING A REST!   <br /> <br /> <br />   <br />nam'saying?  :-)
0385512058|1.0|In the interest of full disclosure, let me state upfront that I spent precisely 45 minutes (and in hindsight perhaps 44 minutes too many) on this book.  The author has a keen, unwavering insight into the blatantly obvious and single-mindedly pursues a one-point agenda of self-promotion.  The only striking and likeable aspect about this text is the neon orange dust jacket. Is there some coincidence at all that vacant books like these are on our business best-seller list and simultaneously we seem to be losing ground to China and India?
B000002AP1|5.0|When this album was released, the Stooges had spent the better part of 5 years alienating themselves from their record labels and mainstream audiences, and it barely made a blip on the album charts. Fortunately, posterity doesn't care about the vicissitudes of the people involved, only the output. And What output indeed...<br />Despite anemic sales figures, this album was immediately immortalized by critics, and it's easy to see why. I mean, MY GOD!!! All of the songs are strong-there's no indication that this band is near death-and the performances are transcendant. Despite two faulty mixes (David Bowie's muddled original mix and Iggy's overloaded effort present on this CD), this is one of the roughest, toughest, maddest, baddest releases EVER released by ANY band. It is impossible to express just how high my estimation of this album is, but let me assure you that after 8 years it remains the ultimate go-to rock disc in my sizable rock collection, and the CD case has the wear and tear to prove it.<br />If Rock is what you seek; if you are tired of \\"best of genre\\" album choices that leave you flat; if you seek high-energy rock of the first order; if you want to figure out just what the hype surrounding the Stooges was all about, GET THIS ALBUM NOW! You will not regret it.
B0000048V8|5.0|This is one of the few movies that left a GREAT impression on myself as a kid.  Watership Down being an example of another.  Ever since I first watched The Snowman (age 5-8), there hasn't been a single year that has passed in my life without me thinking of it.  I am now 22 and only recently did I decide to actually try and put the Internet to use to find this gem amongst gems.  The Snowman gives me such a great sense and feeling of human love and compassion that always results in a tear running down my cheek while I simultaneously smile.  It is a fantastic story that eminates the amount of heart that went into its production.  I am never one to write a review on anything, but I could not let this opportunity pass me as I feel that this movie has truly become part of my soul.   <br /> <br />I recommend this to everyone and especially all parents.  Show this to your kids, and watch as they dive into its majesty. <br /> <br />Truly amazing.
B0009HLDFU|1.0|I like to buy physical CDs for backup in addition to playing them; before MP3s & CDs, I would make taped copies of vinyl records to keep them pristine.

B0007RT9LM|1.0|Now, I don't know about you, but when I go to a bar, call me old fashioned, but I like to have a drink. This seemingly out-dated and crazy notion never once crops up in this brainless teen-fodder. Set in a bar, the bunch of yahoo's drinking there every night don't seem to bother that the barmaids NEVER SERVE ANYONE. I like to look at a hot girl as much as anyone (and the girls ARE nice) but ALL they do is dance on top of the bar. That's it. And the baying fools don't seem to mind. Not once do you hear, \\"so.. uh.. can I get a drink, then?\\" The place is packed, every night, with really, really sober people. I can't imagine the takings in that place.<br /><br />And what's with the refusal to serve water? See, this is their idea of \\"hardcore\\" and cool, that whenever some square asks for water, you blast that sucker with the water hose. Hil-ari-ous.<br /><br />Imagine the scene;<br /><br />Guy: Hi, can I have some water?<br /><br />Girl: Oh, you heard the man!  H-2 - NO!<br /><br />Girl pulls out water hose.<br /><br />Guy: But it's for my medication, I need to take thi.. arghh!<br /><br />Exactly. Oh, the plot? Do you really want to know? Well, some girl moves to the city, wants to become a singer with her collection of really bland songs (just what we need, thanks) which she plays on her roof (in the \\"poignant\\" scenes, see?) and then she meets some idiot who she falls in lov... oh, come on, you KNOW what's going to happen already.<br /><br />But, like my title says, it's perfect for stupid people. Undemanding, happy-ending loving, stupid people. But for anyone with a clue, it's really awful stuff. AND it spawned that horrendous \\"Can't Fight The Moonlight\\", to be murdered in every kareoke bar for ever, another reason to hate it.<br /><br />Don't know what's on this \\"unrated\\" edition. Maybe it's of some lucky punter actually getting served.<br /><br />The_Curmudgeon_Hates_You@yahoo.co.uk

0743454537|4.0|In \\"My Sister's Keeper\\", Jodi Picoult told the stories of seven people: Campbell, a lawyer who has one too many secrets; Sara, a former lawyer, now stay-at-home mom; Brian, a father who escapes to his job, putting out fires, so he doesn't have to face the fires in his own home; Julia, a guardian ad-litem who wastes away her life because of a lost love; Anna, a thirteen-year-old who is invisible and wants to be listened to; Jesse, the brother in the Fitzgerald family who everyone's given up on; and finally Kate, who has been diagnosed with leukemia and is unpurposely the center of the action.  <br />   <br />     When you stop to think about it, the whole story is actually based upon one event- a daughter suing her parents for medical emancipation, and more importantly, the freedom of speech. <br /> <br /> In this story, you will laugh, and maybe even cry; you will think you know the outcome, be completely certain of it, and the truth throws you for a loop. Despite the fact that the story is drawn-on a bit much, it is worth it at the end when it all comes to a dramatic end. <br />

B00080ZG10|3.0|This movie is OK.  I thought all the actors were very good but there was just something missing.  I think Hughes life was almost too interesting - meaning that the story keeps switching to different plots (movies, aviation, women, his anxieties, aviation, another woman, etc).  There was just no real plot and it ends poorly.  Also the story is kinda sad; Hughes' life just keeps getting worse and worse.  Probably the best parts of the movie are the portrayals of historical figures.  Alan Alda does a great job as the evil Senator.  Kate Blanchett is a great Kate Hepburn.

B000002BE9|5.0|what's with people writing two page reviews on an album? like, they are trying to encapsulate the feeling that the actual album gives you? i mean, yeah thats not too bad, but EVERYONE does it. <br /> <br />anyways, that's basically all i wanted to say. but, i too, love this album. it is a deep feeling album, and also seemed to be in constant rotation for me when i was in high school. maybe that's what turned me gay.
B0009HLDFU|1.0|I was absolutely livid when I saw that ugly \\"copy protected\\" logo on the cover of the Foo Fighters' latest CD.  I always rip my CDs to my iPod instead of buying it from iTunes, because I want to own the PHYSICAL CD in the event my computer would crash.  Thank goodness I heard this CD from a buddy of mine, but I won't be buying this CD.  Thanks to these stupid record labels, I will never EVER buy ANY CD that's copy-protected.  Never.
B00008NG5V|5.0|A great follow up to Brushfire Fairytales, and better than his latest In Between Dreams, On and On is the perfect mix of fun tracks, and more serious (but not too serious) ones. This CD offers many songs that are simply great, Taylor, Cookie Jar, and Cocoon to name a few. A great place to start if your new to Johnson, and the CD will be equally rewarding for anyone who is familiar with his work.
B00005JMXX|2.0|Great special effects save this from the dreaded 1 star rating but special effects alone do not constitute a movie. <br /> <br />Everything is half-baked in The Day After Tomorrow.  Tired and predictable plot and script, stereotyped characters, laughable science and politics...  The movie is so sure we will be unable to understand it's so obvious message that it is neatly summarized for us at the end. <br /> <br />I would avoid this turkey.
B0002K6Z16|5.0|You will find many things in this experience - as he would say \\"dark and hard things here\\", but important things that touch to the soul of Man. Have fun counting the place names in all of these songs. It is a tour of the Mid-Atlantic states and the  Old Northwest. This album is a voice from America.
B00005JNTX|2.0|This movie exhibited interesting cinematic creativity. This visual interest is as far as the movie's value extends unfortunately. <br /> <br />There is no redeeming value to the storyline. This movie revels in perversion, sadism, and immorality. This is yet another movie in these troubled times that only adds to the fire and will further twist people's minds. <br /> <br />Let's support good, wholesome, uplifting movies and art! When we focus on these things, then people's thoughts will be on these things. Inline attitudes, thoughts, and behaviors then result. <br /> <br />Let's not wallow in this filth.
B0001CCXY8|4.0|This is pretty brutal and blablabla, but if you ever considered something not just bangbangbang and boobooboo, you should definitely try Messiah - extremely cold wheather, then you might reconsider your opinion about \\"brutal\\" music. If you have chance try Nero, Radetzky March and you'll forget all about CC. Ok, I admit I am promoting different band here and pissinf off a lot of fans but if you're into brutality and aggression Extreme cold wheather should be on your CD shelf. As far as CC goes, anything after Tomb of mutilated is ...(not very good, just noise). Now you can start swearing at me I don't care, I still think CC is just a church choire compared to Agathocles. Ok never heard of that either?, than you might as well start listening to Britney or Shakira. Ok, in conclusion, sorry to everybody I just offended but it was fun. Happy rocking!
B0009MDPYW|4.0|Regardless of what everyone here thinks, I thought the movie was pretty good. Even though there are movies out there with the similar ideas and plots as this, none of them are really like it. Constantine tells of this exorcist or whatever, trying to buy his way into heaven, later meeting up with this cop searching for answers to what really happened to her identical twin sister Isabel. As the movie goes on, she realizes that the stuff that she and her sister saw when they were little girls were indeed real, both holding psychic powers, which brings in her key part in the movie.    Good acting by good actors and pretty nice movie to watch, quite a bit of action but doesn't go overboard but again a good thing because nowadays, younger viewers are all crazy for a lot of explosives etc, which I find now to be a bunch of bs and nothing that makes you think much, guess thats why the average IQ is so low now.    Again, everyone should watch this instead of listening to a bunch of reviews of people on the net. I've watched good movies that people say suck and I've watched bad movies that people say are good. Only way to really find out...is to watch it on your own.
B0007GAERG|5.0|The songs that Mariah Carey has on \\"The Emancipation Mimi\\" are my favorite songs. Like \\"We belong together..\\" is my favorite song on this cd.\\"I got to shack it off..\\"and the other songs on the cd are my favorite too. I would give the cd 10 stars but they will olny let me rate it 5 stars.
B000957O82|4.0|Two great comedy actors Kevin James and Will Smith together in one movie, I doubt this movie can be THAT bad. And as I thought, its not bad at all. Kevin James is so adorable, but I guess his character, not to mention the actor himself, helps bring it out even more. Will Smith was just great, but I didn't expect anything less. <br /> <br />An enjoyable and refreshingly charming and funny movie. I'm just completely tired of movies that are requires the people in there to act totally stupid in order to make the audience laugh. There's good laughing and then there's just... \\"what the hell?\\" kind of laughing. <br /> <br />They could have made the ending better, end it with a big bang, but I guess they didn't but oh well. Watch this movie, its worth it.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|First off, this is a great double disc.  The main reason I am posting a review is that I heard there were issues with getting these copyrighted discs on iPods.  I have them on my iPod and here are directions on how to get it on yours...  Put the disc in CD-ROM and accept all licensing agreements.  Click on Copy Songs. Click on Select All Songs.  After it has copied all songs click on Continue.  Put under My Documents.  X out of screen after done with these steps.  Go to My Computer, My Documents, In_Your_Honor.  Highlight all songs, right click and click on Copy to CD or Device.  This will place all songs in the Window Media Player.  Burn a disc from the W.M.P. by placing your CD-R into the E: drive (this will convert all files from WMAs to MPEG-4s) Use burned disc to put songs on iPod and enjoy this great CD on your iPod as well now.
B0009MDPYW|1.0|If the Matrix And the Exorcist got together and had a baby and it came out as a turd then that would be this movie. Terrible acting, the worst script this side of Reefer Madness, and an unplausible plot revolving around (sigh) the Devil, a hippy-dressing angel, and a holy artifact found in (What!) Mexico? The only thing realistic about that was how easy it is for illegals to cross the border. Now, everyone put their forearms together and repeat after me: GO INTO THE TOILET, I COMMAND THEE! Now flush.
B000002MJC|5.0|I bought this CD some time ago - it kinda just sat on a shelf. Last spring, I rediscovered it while going through a personally challenging time. I couldn't articulate how I felt, but didn't have to thanks to this CD. Like many of us, they are interested in God and here they explore this concept in song. The standout track for me on this CD is \\"In Your Room\\" - hauntingly beautiful but desolate. And who can't relate to \\"Walking in My Shoes\\" (let he who is without sin cast the first stone)? There's one word to describe the song \\"Rush\\" - POWER! Okay, the song is somewhat \\"menacing\\" in tone, but it will certainly get your attention. I have lots of other DM CDs, but this one's my favorite.
B00006AW2G|5.0|This very well could have been their best album. Here we have classics Gimme Shelter, Let It Bleed, Midnight Rambler and You Can't Always Get What You Want paired with Love In Vain, Live With Me, You Got the Silver and Monkey Man. The best songs are, in this order, Let It Bleed, Live With Me and Monkey Man. Eight of these tunes are truly great.<br /><br />But what about the ninth? Country Honk is such an unbelievable disgrace it's unspeakable. For those who haven't heard it (Oh ye lucky ones!) it's basically a countryfied take of Honky Tonk Women. The lyrics of the two songs are virtually the same, but while Honky Tonk Women is a blues-rock tune with saxes, Country Honk is a drunk Country tune with a fiddle. Had Honky Tonk Women been included instead of Country Honk, Let It Bleed would've been their greatest album. With Country Honk, it falls into third place behind Exile and Sticky Fingers. Regardless, I'd buy it if I were you.
B000A6CLL0|4.0|Finally!  Season three of Enterprise is actually something resembling a good show, unlike the pathetic seasons before.  This season has a great share of action.  More shootouts and ship-to-ship fighting.  Captain Archer has changed from his pukey, preachy former self into a fierce captain willing to do anything to protect earth.   <br /> <br />     The story is great.  Starship Enterprise must enter the expanse, a very unstable region of space, to find and destroy the Xindi weapon.  There are some subplots (a few good, a few bad,) but the story focuses on the search for the weapon.  The story has many interesting aspects such as the creators of the weird spheres that litter the expanse.  A fantasic finale was cooked up by the writers that is sure to surprise many. <br /> <br />     I will list the positive and negative points of this season: <br /> <br />   +More action <br />   +A much more complex storyline <br />   +Captain Archer is now a great character <br />   +Less gag moments <br />   +One of the best finales of any show <br /> <br />   -Some pretty awful episodes (example: the crew find a planet set up as the wild west) <br />   -The stupid relationship between Science Officer Ta`pol and Chief Engineer Trip is expanded on and on <br />   -Some indecent episodes <br /> <br />     Season three of Enterprise is what the previous seasons should have been: a centralized storyline, a great captain, and lots of action.   I recommend skipping the first two seasons and move to this season instead. <br /> <br />
B0002NRQTS|4.0|After several album of increasing synth work Rush turns down the electronics and brings the guitars up front. Don't get me wrong there are still synths but you can actually hear some guitar now! Show Don't Tell kicks things off nicely. A smart melodic rocker which discusses our legal system. Then it goes into another rocker in the form of Chain Lightning. Other rockers on here include the energetic Superconductor to the catchy Red Tide. The Pass is a nice mellow song that is a favorite of the band themselves. War Paint has some nice keyboard work while Scars is mostly keyboards. A very emotional song that is one of my favorite Rush songs and sadly,one of their most underrated.  <br /> <br />I personnally feel that Presto is one of Rush's least respected albums which is a cruel injustice as it is filled with wonderful music. Of course I can only explain so much of the album,this is one of those albums that everybody just has to hear.
B000002IOJ|4.0|TESTAMENT - \\"PRACTICE WHAT YOU PREACH\\" : TO THE POINT REVIEW <br /> <br />Track 1 : \\"Practice What You Preach\\" - Great opener musically...lyrically laughable. Neverless, it's a classic mosher, and one of Testament's best songs w/ a great solo. <br /> <br />Track 2 : \\"Perilous Nation\\" - One of Bay Area thrashers finest numbers, w/ one of Skolnick's very best solos. Flawlessly written and executed; the highlight of the album. <br /> <br />Track 3 : \\"Envy Life\\" - Filler track w/ decent riffs. <br /> <br />Track 4 : \\"Time Is Coming\\" - Testament regains momentum on this track w/ great riffs and tempo changes, while leading into one of the album's best cuts. <br /> <br />Track 5 : \\"Blessed in Contempt\\" - The 2nd quickest song on the album , with driving riffs and a fantastic solo section, one of the album's best. <br /> <br />Track 6 : \\"Greenhouse Effect\\" -  One Testament's most popular songs is also one of their most lyrically accomplished, but not one of my personal favorites. <br /> <br />Track 7 : \\"Sins Of Omission\\" - Filler track w/ decent riffs. <br /> <br />Track 8 : \\"The Ballad\\" - Testament KNOWS ballads, and this is no exception. Opens with a sorta Pink Floyd type sound and transforms into thrash on a dime. One of Testament's best songs. <br /> <br />Track 9 : \\"Nightmare (Coming Back To You) - The quickest song on the album starts out feeling like as a filler track, but turns out to be a pretty infectious cut w/ a great solo. <br /> <br />Track 10: \\"Confusion Fusion\\" - Pointless, but fairly engaging  instrumental closer that could have been much more. <br /> <br />OVERALL: A very solid effort from one of the very best thrash bands ever, much better than \\"Souls Of Black\\" and \\"The Ritual\\".  \\"Perilous Nation\\" alone is worth the purchase price. <br /> <br />ALSO CHECK OUT: \\"The Legacy\\" and \\"The New Order\\" by Testament.
B0009MDPYW|1.0|Dull, loud and boring adaptation of the classic horror comic book lacks a real leading man for the movie to fly with its bad script and almost as bad special effects. While Keanu fails miserably in his role, his co-star Rachel Weisz does more with hers than the actual movie does, giving her character a real sense of grace and strong will despite the lousy dialog, Badly written characters and insane plot clichs that is surrounding her during the course of the movie. Weisz's performance alone is worth the price of the rental but other than her, there is really no reason rush to see the bad film.
B000001DQI|5.0|As good as a large number of his albums are, Elton John is generally renowned more for his classic singles and individual songs, his celebrated partnership with lyricist Bernie Taupin having spawned some of the most memorable hits of the late 20th Century. However, \\"Captain Fantastic and The Brown Dirt Cowboy\\" was the first album ever to enter the US album chart at number one, while the debut at number one of it's follow-up, \\"Rock of The Westies\\" secured Elton as the first act to achieve back-to-back album releases to top of the American chart in the first week of release, not to mention the fact his 1974 \\"Greatest Hits\\" package remains one of the world's 20 best-selling albums of all time. For all these achievements though, I feel I can say only one Elton John album is a true \\"classic\\" - his 1973 double album, \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\\".<br /><br />Although this is considered something of a concept album with the familiar strand it maintains throughout, I'm not quite sure where the album is supposed to lead to, if indeed it is meant to lead anywhere. It seems to surround Bernie Taupin's fascination with the American west, perhaps during the time of the depression in the 1930's, mixed with the apparent glamour of the Hollywood movies and some good old rock `n' roll from the 1950's.<br /><br />The album kicks off with the grand opening of \\"Funeral For A Friend / Love Lies Bleeding\\" which is the perfect epic start to a rock double album. From there, there are many music genres to be found, including the country honk of \\"Social Disease\\" and the reggae tinted \\"Jamaica Jerk Off\\", a song which Elton later admitted to hating. Elton's brilliant piano playing is particularly evident in songs like \\"Grey Seal\\" and the classic \\"Bennie And The Jets\\", a glam rock anthem if ever there was. Then of course there's \\"Candle In The Wind\\", arguably Elton and Bernie's most famous song but curiously just missing out on the Top 10 when originally released as a single in the UK. A live version reached number 5 in the UK in 1988, and, when rerecorded with lyrics rewritten in tribute to the late Diana, Princess of Wales, the song became the world's biggest selling single under the title of \\"Candle In The Wind 1997\\". Some of Elton's finest rock songs are found on this album - the eternal crowd-pleaser, \\"Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting\\", \\"Your Sister Can't Twist (But She Can Rock `N' Roll)\\", \\"All The Girls Love Alice\\" and \\"Dirty Little Girl\\". The ballads are just as memorable, from the whimsical title track to the melancholy \\"Sweet Painted Lady\\". Overall the album oozes confidence from Elton and his band at a time when he was riding the crest of his newfound success.<br /><br />Elton has said that he recorded this double album in an attempt to singularly fulfill the contractual obligation he had to his record company to record and release two albums per year (the record company didn't see it that way and still insisted on another record).  However, it's always seemed like commercial suicide for an artist to release a double album (hence why so few or probably even none are attempted nowadays) as so very few have been both good and successful (the Beatles' \\"White Album\\" and U2's \\"Rattle And Hum\\" being the only exceptions that spring to mind), but Elton managed to pull it off in brilliant style, not only recording a good double album but, in my opinion, still the best album of his career.e version reached number 5 in the UK in 1988, and, when rerecorded with lyrics rewritten in tribute to the late Diana, Princess of Wales, the song became the world's biggest selling single under the title of \\"Candle In The Wind 1997\\".

B00097DX3U|3.0|Rage Against the Machine and Soundgarden were outstanding (although I'll admit to a major bias in favor of Soundgarden), but I don't think the elements blend well together. It sounds like the guys from Rage are still writing songs for Zack De La Rocha rather than Chris Cornell. So, Chris Cornell is writing lyrics for music that really just sounds like Rage, and I don't think it works. They have a predictable pattern within their song structures, and once you notice it you'll want to stop listening. Rage was becoming repetitive before Zack left, and they haven't developed much more with Chris Cornell as a vocalist. They don't have the musical abilities to match the potential of Chris Cornell's voice. I love Soundgarden and Rage Against the Machine, but if this a new band, they should work out some different sounds. The drumming is boring and I'm over Tom M's guitar noodling. Even so, it's better than at least 50% of the new music out there so I can't justify anything less than 3 stars. I'll reserve the 1 and 2 star ratings for really horrible bands.
B0009HLDFU|2.0|Gone are the days of Dave Grohl beating me across the face with ripping guitar riffs, punchy post-punk / post-grunge pop, and general goodness.  Here comes an album almost - but not quite - as bad as \\"There is Nothing Left to Lose\\".  And what's more, it's copy protected. <br /> <br />Not that the copy protection is worthy of note:  if you turn off auto-play, Windows doesn't ever bother you while importing the songs into iTunes, and then you have perfectly iPod-compatible files. <br /> <br />This album really left me cold.  Hey, Dave: if you're going to copy-protect something, make it something worthwhile.
B000002G23|5.0|I brought this box set back in 2004 because after hearing the Every Breath You Take: The Classics collection, which was a brief, but amazing collection, I was just left wanting more. I found that this box set would be the \\"last\\" Police album I will purchase because it was \\"complete\\". Message In A Box is a 4-disc collection covering their entire studio output including Outlandos d' Amour, Reggatta de Blanc, Zenyatta Mondatta, Ghost In The Machine, and their last album, Synchronicity. The collection also includes their first 3 singles: Fallout, Nothing Achieving, and Dead End Job; which shows their orgins as a punk-rock band, doing social-political statements and getting their points across. Throughout all four discs, the band keeps evolving musically from doing material with a strong punk-rock influence, which is edgy and rough to doing more smooth and polished reggae, jazz, and pop arrangements. With Sting's incredible and complex bass and saxophone work, Stewart Copeland's dynamic drumming, and Andy Summers' infectious and stunning guitar textures, they showed that they weren't The Beatles, The Clash, or even The Ramones. They wanted to be a band in their own right, and this box set proves that. This box has all of the hits, (Walking On The Moon, Roxanne, So Loney, Can't Stand Losing You, Don't Stand So Close To Me, De Do Do Do, De Da Da Da Da, Spirits in the Material World, Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic, and Every Breath You Take), but what really makes this set so special are the lesser-known cuts, the live gems, and those rare B-sides. I really think the Brimstone & Treacle soundtrack tracks are interesting and the live cuts are very electrifying, but if you are really interested at what they did on stage, I'd recommend you pick up the 1995 live recording, \\"Live\\", which consist two concerts from 1979 and 1983. The album cuts, which are probably less-known among fans, are just as superior as their popular hits. I just adore some of the instrumentals on here like Reggatta de Blanc. Message In A Box is essentially the gold standard of all rock collections, in my eyes. With four discs of their complete studio works and then some, and a very insightful 68-page booklet with many rare and unseen pictures and thoughtful annonations from all of the members of the group, you can't go wrong with just getting it all in one convenient place. So, save your pennies and buy this box set. I'd recommend it to all Police fans, casual and hardcore alike. A+
B0000062FL|5.0|This album is one of the best albums in all of rock history.  I mean what Carlos Santana did for music in general was huge, mixing all sorts of styles together.  Here's a quick breakdown of each track.<br />1.Singing Winds/Crying Beasts-What a opener.  Everything just works so well on this cut.  Carlos's guitar is exaclty that !crying on this track.  It a great opener to the album. 10<br />2.Black Magic Woman/Gypsy Queen-Great keyboard riff and the guitar work on this is stellar.  Classic Santana ! 10 <br />3.Oye Como Va-A Tito Puente songs that sounds even better when Santana does it.  Classic Santana ! 10<br />4.Incident At Neshabur-I love the jaz feel to this.  The ending is my fav part when they go really slow.  Carlos is once again on top on this track.<br />5.Se A Cabo-Can anyone say conga !  The percussion in this track is unbeleivable !  i dig the cowbell ! 10<br />6.Mother's Daughter-My Greg Rollie song !  What a vocal performance.  Carlos's guitar work is great on this track.  10<br />7.Samba Pa Ti-OH MY GOD !!  This is IMO the instrumentals to end all instrumentals !  The best guitar work I've ever heard on any record.  Better than Stairway to Heaven, even though I ama huge Zep fan.  This song will change anyones perception of what a great guitar can sound like while doing a solo ! 10000000000000000000 <br />8.Hope Your Feeling Better-Great vocals once againg by Mr. Rollie.    Great guitar riff from Carlos.  10<br />9.Il Nicoya-Interesting vamp on one chord.  I hgave no idea what the title means but it's a great way to finish of the album. 10<br />Bonus tracks-The 3 bonus tracks were recorded live in 1970 at the Royal Albert Hall in London.  Out of all 3, Toussant L'overture sticks out ot me the most becasue of the guitar riff and the percussion.<br />IF YOU ARE A CLASSIC ROCK FAN THIS IS AN ALBUM YOU SHOULD NOT BE WiTHOUT !!!
B00008NG5V|5.0|Jack Johnson is the greatest lyricist of this generation.  His music defines \\"feel good\\" music.  You can't help but hum along.  No matter what your mood or musical tastes, listening to On and On will make you feel better about your day.  I bought this copy for a client and he can't thank me enough.
B00006CXSS|5.0|What the heck?  Someone actually gave this series one star?  I think he was just trying to be different, or an idiot.  I've seen many many war movies, including classics like \\"the Longest Day\\".  But \\"Band of Brothers\\" is at the very top of my list.  It was so good, that by episode 5, I wanted to stop watching the series for a while, because I wanted to savor the moment like enjoying a great wine, because I knew I would never see a war series or a war movie that good again.  Authentic?  You can't get any more authentic than getting the information from interviews and diaries from the veterans themselves.  Buy this DVD set!!!
B00081U6EG|4.0|I have mixed feelings about this disc. Some great moments and some that didn't belong, or have any reason to belong, on a celebration of the Fender Stratocaster, ie Jamie Cullem? not even any guitar in the song. Get off! What a waste of time.<br />Highlights:<br />Okay, main reason to buy this disc, for me, was David Gilmour. The outstanding Pink Floyd guitar player that is playing the very first Fender Strat made on &quot;Marooned&quot; and &quot;Coming Back to Life&quot;. Full version of &quot;Sorrow&quot;. At 59 David remains strong in his playing and vocals. I also recently discovered that David, beside being a gifted player, is also a quiet charitable giver to homeless causes, giving several millons of pounds to charity. It is nice to hear a &quot;rock star&quot; doing this.<br />Next is Gary Moore. Absolutely blistering performance of &quot;Red House&quot; that will make any guitar player jealous of his abilites.<br />True to form, he uses only Bass and drums as accompaniment in tribute to Hendrix.<br />Nice country/bluegrass picking from British player Albert Lee when he plays &quot;Country Boy&quot;.<br />Hank Marvin shows that he still has the licks when he plays the old songs from the Shadows.<br />Nice to see Mike Rutherford from Genesis, and Phil Manzanera, who was backing David Gilmour through his set.<br />I've seen better performances from Joe Walsh, but still entertaining.<br />Watch Phil Palmer playing guitar in the &quot;house band&quot;. He gets opportunity to play some lead guitar in several songs and he is an under-appreciated player.<br />I always like seeing Brian May from Queen, but it was strange to see him playing a Strat, when he usually only plays his home-made red special (he does bring it out on one song).<br />Now, why not make an effort to get some excellent strat players who were not there? ie Eric Capton, Yngwie Malmsteen, to name two. I'm sure that if this were truely a celebration of the Fender Strat there would have been a more concerted effort made to obtain these guys who have made their living off this excellent guitar.<br />Overall 4 stars, but Gilmour and Moore earned them.t made to obtain these guys who have made their living off this excellent guitar.<BR>Overall 4 stars, but Gilmour and Moore earned them.
B0000640VO|5.0|It's kind of hard to tell sometimes whether a movie is trying to be too indie and smart for it's own good, or whether the movie is just charming and likable without trying to do so all along. With Amelie, there's a feeling of charm running throughout the entire thing but without feeling pre-fabricated. Jean Pierre Jeunet(he directed the awful Alien Resurrection but did do Delicatessen) made a film that shows there is still genuine filmmakers behind the camera. <br /> <br />Amelie is a single waitress surrounded by people who need some life fixing. She finds an old box that the previous tenant from decades ago left and she decides to return it to him. This then sparks an idea to start wanting to do good to everyone else. A creepy man and a waitress get together, her widowed father who never travels lives through a garden gnome who is getting photos taken at various European sites. And there's plenty more. <br /> <br />However she finds that her life needs some tending to as well, so enter an odd man who collects torn up photographs from those instant photo booths. Only instead of doing what others would do which is just to go up to him and talk, she takes him through a series of mini-adventures(such as a humoress one where he follows painted blue arrows only to have to run back). <br /> <br />There's CG in the film but it's not as instrusive as one might expect. She's got a cool little pig lamp that turns itself off, photos talk back to a guy(similar in a way to Harry Potter photos), paintings converse and Amelie turns into a puddle. It's also gorgeously shot. One of my favorite shots is where she skips stones near a waterfall/dam and the camera arcs from above the waterfall to the other side just above the water. Another part of the film's charm is its star, Audrey Tautou. Like Audrey Hepburn, she's got a lovable quality where you can't help but want to watch her. <br /> <br />If you actually start thinking of its length, it might feel long but if you really get into the film, it just flies by.
0806930152|4.0|This book is a great reference tool for drawing the body.  Not only are the many pictures found within the book very helpful but the text also explains how the body moves and operates.  The author shows his vast knowledge of the body by even describing the major muscles and bones of each section of the body.  The book is well organized, thus easy to look up the area you wish to study.  My only wish is that it had even more text to go into greater discription and detail; the text in this book is very brief.  Enjoy! Any sketch artist interested in learning how the body moves and articulates will not be sorry that you purchased this book.
B0002VL0KQ|2.0|Is it a lullaby CD for parents to put the little ones to bed with? Is it a \\"new mommy\\" CD that mommy and baby can bond together with? Is it a \\"soft pop\\" CD that was supposed to have some commercial appeal? Other than just being really BAD I'm not sure what it is. And if it was to be any of the others I mentioned it missed its mark...big time. Now to be fair, I do understand why she wanted to do it. She's a new Mom, she loves children, she thinks Ann's photos are cute and sweet...and they are. I am a new parent myself and I LOVE my son. So I do understand getting all wrapped up in having a new child in your life. But Miracle is just a confusing mess of mediocre material.<br /><br /> Years ago Olivia Newton-John released a CD called Warm and Tender. It was meant to be a lullaby album and that's exactly what it is. My son listens to the Warm and Tender CD every night as he falls asleep...he loves it and it is a beautiful album. However, I can't say the same about Miracle. I am truly surprised Celine's record label did a major commercial release with this product. Really Celine, you are one of the greatest singers in the world with an absolutely phenomenal voice. I demand that \\"Team Celine\\" release Ms. Dion from all the gimmicky sales promotions and productions like Chrysler ads, the Wal-Mart perfume, and the baby book, no matter how cute it is. And let Celine get back to what she does best which is music and GREAT SINGING!<br /><br />So in closing folks, if you love, and are looking for, the Celine Dion that sang her heart out on great songs like My Heart Will Go On and The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face you won't find her anywhere on Miracle.
B0007QJ1MK|5.0|Raise your hand if you were suspicious about Nick Oliveri's hauloff ruining the Qeens. How many of you still had high hopes for the Queens? Oh, dang. That's cold. Anyway, I'm right here with you. I went out and bought the album hoping it will be a good album. Of course, the album didn't sit well with me on my first listen. But on my second listen and more, it became the best Queens album I have ever heard. Much more arty than any other Queens album or any other album Josh Homme has taken part of. I'll give you the rundown. <br />(This is out of 5) <br /> <br />1. This Lullaby: The song will get you thinking of the buoy rocking, and he is sitting in the bost just singing away and fishing. The best start of the album thus far. (5) <br /> <br />2. Medication: They rip thruogh just to show that Queens of the Stone Age is sill running strong. (5) <br /> <br />3. Everybody Know That You Are Insane: Well, I don't have to explain the song, No do I? The best part of the song was the voice of Josh Homme. (5) <br /> <br />4. Tangled Up In Plaid: Crunchy Metal-Punk at it's best, really. (4) <br /> <br />5. Burn The Witch: \\"Holding hands, skipping like a stone...\\" The song has a real headbanging quality to it. SOmething worth listening to, especially for the ZZ Top Influence. (4.5) <br /> <br />6. In My Head: I hear PLENTY of complaints that this song is from Desert Sesions Vol. 9 & 10. No offense, but if you know Queens' history, you'd know that that happens every album. Anyone who heard \\"Hanging Tree\\" must know that it came from Vol. 7 & 8. \\"Monsters in the Parasol\\" comes from Vol. 3&4. If I'm wrong, please correct.  Anyway, this version sounds a LOT better than Desert Sessions version. QOTSA also tend to do that a lot on their records, too. (6) <br /> <br />7. Little Sister: The viewpoint of the wolf and the relative. The relative is the verse. To tell you the truth, I wish the song is a little longer. But...that would have them sound like they succumbed to theverse-chorus-verse-chorus-breakdown-chorus-ending. That will kill the originality, wouldn't it? (4) <br /> <br />8. I Never Came: It must be the fact that this is the slowest song on the album that got me to enjoy this song. I love it. (4.5) <br /> <br />9. Someone's In The Wolf: The song is the best, plus, I heard the cutoff at the end, and wished the song was a little longer. Epic out of all the songs they wrote. (5) <br /> <br />10. The Blood is Love: Eh. OK. (3) <br /> <br />11. Skin On Skin: I'm not big on raunchy music but they went out on a limb with this. Still I have an urge to skip the song. (3) <br /> <br />12. Broken Box: Death By Sexy! Everybody get on the dance floor. The sound not only sounds sexy in its own right, but I'd listen to the Queens experiment with Dance-Rock anytime. Wouldn't you? (5) <br /> <br />13. \\"You Got A Killer Scene There, Man...\\": Imagine everyone in a swing bar blowing their trumpets and sipping on the finest margeritas, and The Queens busting in with the men dessed in black suits and a top hat with a feather on it wooing hte crowd after a grand entrance. Sounds like an experinece not to miss. Right? (4.5) <br /> <br />14. Long Slow Goodbye: Say Goodbye to the Wolves with a funeral song for ages. Also the most rock-pop in music, this one. The best song they have written for an ending. (5) <br /> <br />15. (bonus session): ...unless you think that this trumpet feast of a bonus track is the best ending to an elegant story of the ages. (5) <br /> <br />What is a band like Queens to do in a year of Concept albums and ROCK THE VOTE!!!? Well, it seems they survived it OK. <br /> <br />68.5/75 =  91/100
B00005ATQF|5.0|Full Metal Jacket is the 2nd Kubrick movie that I've seen and I really enjoyed it. I liked The Shining better though! Watch it! <br />But this movie is different than other war movies. And it's the originality of this movie that makes it such a good movie! It's so original because it's divided into 2 parts. I preferred the 1st because it's the original part. Instead of focussing on the war like all other war movies, this part focusses on the actual training. But this training is showing the brutality and atrocity of war. But this is in the training. It shows the drill officer picking on one soldier for this whole section. Everyone hates this soldier and he suffers and is driven to madness. This part is ended by a tragic and gruesome moment. Therefore it shows not the war between the americans and vietnamese but instead the war between the americans. Or basically all of the americans against one american. <br />The 2nd part is actual Vietnam. It focusses on a journalist also present in the 1st part that is in Vietnam.  <br />The movie is sad, violent, brutal, gruesome but very memorable. This is an excellent movie that I preferred over Saving Private Ryan. I recommend this movie to everyone wanting to watch an excellent war movie. I probably wouldn't buy it because it's hard to watch. Th acting is brilliant, notably by the drill seargeant who is very convincing.
0060736267|5.0|Betty Smith sure has a way of making the reader connect with the characters. I was very moved by this book. The characters were very likable, especially Francine and her little brother. Reading this brings me back to my childhood years. Although its rather long, don't let the  number of the pages discourage you from reading it, the pages fly by faster than you think. I finished it in only a 4 days. Definitely a must read.
B00009V8Z9|4.0|As a singer/songwriter myself, the artists of the 2000's has rarely hit me over the head with something that has made me take notice of music lately.  It seems all you hear nowadays is stuff about sex, dancing, stripping, and more sex--as if that is the entire gambit of human emotion and existence.  On top of that, the future Bob Dylans, Janis Joplins, Pretenders and Jimmy Hyndrixes have to take a back seat to blond haired blued eyed teeny boppers singing about a crush or being up in \\"dah club\\"....little wonder I as well as some of my music buddies refuse to listen to modern  radio! <br /> <br />That is why the first time I was riding in a friends car and heard I DON'T WANT TO BE I on the radio I was floored.  I was greeted by this rich passionate voice with lyrics that actually said something. <br /> <br />Not since Stone Temple Pilots Scott Weiland or Norah Jones has an artist gripped me with the rawness of their vocal and lyrical talent.  It felt  honest, so I automaticlly knew before anyone told me that the man had written the tune himself (this is why I agree with one reviewer who mentioned how low class it was to say the man's lyrics were stupid.  They obviously come from Gavin's personal experiences or observations.  You can perhaps say you don't like the content or  don't like the style of the tune, but to say what someone has to say is stupid is at worst disingenious and at the least shows you may be one of those \\"musical elitist\\" who believe that any one who performs a style you do not care for automaticlly \\"sucks,\\" as if the world has to revole around their particular likes or dislikes. <br /> <br />This attitude is prevalent in the performance arena and I have never liked it as I feel it is a self centered perception. <br /> <br />I love all types of music, and if I run into good pop I can appreciate it as well.  I judge not by genres to look cool for my other musician friends--I judge based on what moves me. <br /> <br />And this kids' voice moved me enough to want to write a review about it. <br /> <br />That said, I feel he is still evolving as an artist, as some tunes just did not grab me the way I DON'T WANT TO BE, but I still feel Gavin is the best offering we've had in the pop genre in a long time.  I just hope he won't fall to the wayside because he is such an anomoly (it seems genuine talent keeps getting overshadowed by people with little to say who are ever more willing to bare some flesh and shake thier boo-hooties...) <br /> <br />I feel an artist of his calibre should be supported and that is why he will probably be the first album I will go and purchase since 1999.  Why? <br /> <br />Well, even though I feel some of his writing is still developing, I have no doubt someone this gifted will grow into an amazing indisputable talent, and we have to nuture him, if only to tell the music industry that we want MORE of this please!  I mean come on, we are at least to blame for what the industry keeps feeding us.  It says something that an artist like Ashlee Simpson can get on national TV show, get caught lip synching and can still have a bona fide career in music. <br /> <br />One thing is for certain, Gavin sounds good live or recorded, and he will never have an Ashlee Simpson moment. <br /> <br />Lets support TALENT and get away from the booty-shakers. <br /> <br />Am I against fun music?  Heck no...it has it's place.  A good dance tune can make a party rock--however--I am not always in party mode, so for the love of God give me something of quality I can listen to when I am in a \\"I just want to go home and relax\\" mode, something like this Cd.
0385335482|5.0|Just seeing the title of this book, I couldn't resist, being a shopaholic myself. I loved reading about Becky's crazy adventures and shopping debts, and how she manages to get them resolved in the end before it's all too late. The bank letters were intrestings. It's filled with humor and friendship. Definitely reccommend.
B0000AYL17|5.0|For me, this album closes off the 1970s. It had been a magnificent decade for intelligent rock music, despite the murderous intent of punk from 1976 onwards. It was somehow fitting that Walter Becker and Donald Fagen should sign off with one of their saddest but most beautiful songs, 'Third World Man'. The pair don't play any of the instruments on that closing track. And with that, it's farewell to incarnation #1 of Steely Dan.<br /><br />Although it was immaculately recorded, I don't think there are many Dan fans who believed the overall quality of the album was quite up there with any of the previous six classics. Which begs the question, why is it that only this Steely Dan album has made it to SACD? There is no doubt that the three previous albums -- Katy Lied, Royal Scam and Aja -- would all benefit from a 5.1 surround remastering for SACD.
0375751513|5.0|Oscar Wilde never disappoints. His plays are amazing & so is his only novel, \\"The picture of dorian gray\\". This is one of my favorite classics novels. Wilde's vivid details captured my intrest from the very first page. The characters were well developed, the ending was great. Overall, this is a must read book! It has everything from suspense, romance, drama, to art. I would definitely have to read it again sometime. Maybe it'll be the first book I ever re-read.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|All the songs on this album are awesome. Some of the songs are a little repetitive and dumb but minus that i can listen to this everyday. I'll sing along to it too!
B0002OERI0|4.0|I purchased this cd as a gift for my boyfriend, and then I \\"bought\\" myself a copy. All the songs on this cd kick ass. My favorite would be \\"Are we the waiting\\" Very powerful music and lyrics. I would reccommend this cd for everyone. Probably the best cd since \\"Dookie\\"
B00006RCNJ|5.0|My parents made me buy this. They had watched it in Australia at a friends house. <br />The concert starts off very traditionally, with popular classical pieces - nothing too unusual. <br />Then it starts to build on the emotion and fun that only Andre Rieu can put into clasical music.  <br />From there, it just keeps building. This is a \\"must have\\". You don't need to be big on classical music to enjoy this DVD and if you are big on classical music I doubt you've experienced the amount of joy Andre Rieu can put in a piece of music.
B0000C2IQD|5.0|I saw this on the original DVD of this movie, but all the same, it's still wonderful! In fact, fantasmagorical! When bring some of the hottest stars, songwriters, directors, and dancers of the decade together, you are sure to be in for a treat. <br /> <br />The story takes place in the British country side, where races are held every so often. Two children, Jeremy and Jemima (Adrian Hall and Heather Ripley), would play in the junkyard with the worn down cars. There they meet a lady named Truly Scrumptious (Sally Ann Howes) who wants to meet the childrens' parents. She drives Jeremy and Jemima over to the house with the windmill, where she meets Caratacus Potts (Dick Van Dyke, Mary Poppins, Diagnosis Murder), an inventor whose inventions goe awry. The two meet and argue for some time. Potts always has time for his children, even when his inventions don't go the way he planned. His father, (Lionel Jefferies), encourages him to give up his inventions, and start living in reality. Potts considers this, until his dog, Edison, gives him an idea of a new candy: toot sweets. A candy that toots like a flute. The next day, he sends his invention to Lord Scrumptious (James Robertson Justice), head of a large candy factory. He approves of this candy, until the whistle sounds sends a pack of dogs into the factory, and Scrumptious rejects it. Saddened by this, Jeremy and Jemima try to comfort their father by willing to give up their most precious possessions so that Potts can buy the car the children were trying to save from the junkyard. Potts appreciates this, but couldn't take them. He reassures them that he will find a way to make money, 30 shillings, to be exact, and he does! He sends his latest invention, a hair styling machine, to the fair that's being held in town. But once again, his invention goes awry, and a chase from an angry customer leads Potts to a dancing act he performs in, and in the end, earns him enough money to buy the car for his children. Jeremy and Jemimaare excited, and can't wait to see what their father does to fix the car. What will happen to the car? Will Potts and Truly ever get along? Is this the ultimate adventure for everyone? <br /> <br />This film has great dancing, choreographed by the choreographers of Mary Poppins. It simply makes me want to dance along with them! It also has great songs by the same songwriting team of Mary Poppins, The Parent Trap, The Jungle Book, Bedknobs and Broomsticks, Charlotte's Web, Snoopy Come Home, Little Nemo, and many more great classics, Robert B. Sherman and Richard M. Sherman. They are delightful! You'll love \\"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\\", \\"You Two\\", \\"Husabye Mountain\\", \\"Me Ol' Bam-Boo\\", \\"Truly Scrumptious\\", and many more songs from this film.  <br /> <br />This film is one of the many grat musical classics of the 20th century. There aren't much of them around these days, and that makes me sad. Who couldn't love the funny Dick Van Dyke? He brings so much happiness to every movie or show he does. And the music is so unforgettable. You'll love it. I can't wait to own the special edition DVD. Buy it today! It's chitty chittyrific!
0676974562|3.0|Frankly, I'm not too sure about this one. The language is great but I found it too 'elongated'. I guess it's just me..going into details for a certain scenario for too long isn't my taste.<BR>So for readers out there who are like me (I like books like 'Gap Creek', Frank McCourt's, Drowning Ruth, Umberto Eco's 'Name Of The Rose', etc. etc.)..you might want to think again before reading this.<br />I'll give Ian's work another chance though..I have his 'Saturday'... maybe that will change my opinion.
0553108034|5.0|I wont waste your time with a 5 paragraph critical analysis on this book.  All I can tell you is that this series is superior to any other fantasy series that I have ever read.  The intricate plotlines and dynamic characters is matched by no one.  The style of writing is fluid and you never find yourself having to read over a boring chapter.  This book will keep you busy for quite a long time but you will never get bored with it.  Read this series for your own good.
B0009HLDFU|1.0|I have read some pretty good reviews about this collection, and even listened to the samples on the Amazon site, enjoying what little I heard. Then I read that the CD won't play on my Mac, can't be ripped by my Mac onto my iPod, and that's all I thought I needed to know. No thanks.    Postscript- I became intrigued when I saw that folks with Macs could indeed rip and import this CD right into iTunes. I bought the CD this evening, about an hour after the above post. I put it into my Mac G5. It ripped every song to the hard drive and then synced them with my iPod. No problems here.    Oh, and the music is good too. This copy protection argument is, at least for this album and this Mac user, specious. For Mac users, there is NO copy protection on this CD. Four stars!
0446530573|5.0|I have a personal library of over 500 cookbooks, yet I feel this is the best cookbook I have purchased in years. Every recipe works!  The \\"family\\" history is very entertaining.
B000002OX7|5.0|One of the greatest rock albums of all time.  Classic tracks include: \\"Baba O'Riley\\", \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" and \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\".  An absolute classic (along with Quadrophenia and Tommy) that should be in any cd collection.  To all the Limp Bizkit fans who think The Who ripped off Behind Blue Eyes, might want to do their homework before stating such crap!!!  Who's Next probably came out before any of members of Limp Bizkit were born.
0553579908|5.0|The sequel to A Game of Thrones, and the second book in the Song of Ice and Fire series is continuing the excellence displayed in Martin's writing.  If you haven't read A Game of Thrones, what exactly are you doing here?  Go buy that book, then if you like it (I'm sure you will), get this one immediately.  Just try and pace yourself because remember old George doesn't really pound these books out every couple months... or years for that matter.
B000005JAK|5.0|This is the first album I heard from Husker Du. I like alot of things about it. Its fast, heavy, slow, and mellow all on one album. Bob Mould and Grant Hart really wrote some great songs on this record, especially Hart. This was the beginning of the end of Husker Du as Mould and Hart would fight for control and break up the band. Favorites include Don't Want to Know if You Are Lonely, Sorry Somehow, Too Far Down, Eiffel Tower High, and  All This I've Done for You. Highly Recommended.
0553573403|5.0|This book is great.  It starts you off into an incredible world created by George R. R. Martin, with characters he's not afraid to build up and kill off.  This book has everything, for as fantasy and unreal as it is, it's also realistic in that he leaves nothing behind in betrayal, sex, alcohol, death, and life.  Definitely get this book, don't listen to anyone who tells you differently.  Great fantasy series, and I don't even LIKE fantasy.  If you like Lord of the Rings, read these but brace yourself for the writing style and plot-line, they're better.
B00005JNTX|5.0|This is the best comic book movie because it is the comic word to word. The actors are all good in their roles especially Mickey Rourke as Marv which is the perfect casting choice. Though a comic book movie this one isn't for kids so don't let them watch it. The direction by directors Robert Rodriguez and Sin City creator Frank Miller and guest director Quentin Tarantino bring Miller's comic book world to life. Also great roles are Bruce Willis as Hartigan and Benicio Del Toro as Jackie Boy. Highly Recommended.
0452286379|4.0|When I started reading this book, it did not feel as it if was written in the 40s (well except for some slang).  This novel is definitely a though read, the author does not allow you one moment of relaxation, pumping the book full of deeper meaning.  Sometimes it takes someone else to point out obvious theories about life, and what we're living for, which is ultimately what she does.<br />But I agree with a previous reviewer that our hero was not much of a hero because he took what he wanted and didnt care about others - while other characters didnt even know what *they* themselves wanted, and were very much worried about what others would think.  Ultimately, I believe that Ayn created the characters in different extremes to make a clear point about what the differences were between them.
B000002LQD|5.0|Magic and Loss by Lou Reed is a tribute to two of his friends that had died. Using that and mythical messages Reed has created some of his best songs. There his best because there personal and the guitar and his voice go good with them. Also features Jimmy Scott as a guest. Favorites include What's Good, Power and Glory (ft. Jimmy Scott), Sword of Damocles, Goodby Mass, Warrior King, Power and Glory, Pt. 2, and Magic and Loss. Highly Recommended.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Band of Brothers is a very good look at what soldiers went through in world war II. It focues on Easy Company, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne. Unlike the book, it focuses on many of the people in the company, from the Lieutenants to the private. <br /> <br />   Episode One is a kind of drama comedy type thing. It begins with the company training in Camp Taccoa with their first CO, played by David Schwimmer from Friends. It follows them from here to the take off of the 101st to Normandy. <br />   The second episode takes place in Normandy. It begins with great special effects of the landing in the company. From there it shows the handful of the E Company men that came down in the right place take some artillery enplacments. <br />   The third episode is on the of the first episodes to focus on mainly one man. The company is still in Normandy and forming up. Albert Blithe, a private, is the main guy in this one. He is a coward and it shows how he overcomes his fears. Also in this episode the company takes Carentan and a ridge. They then return to England. <br />    Episode four is the drop into Holland. E Company takes part in Operation Market Garden. Bull Randlemen is the main guy in this one, is a Sergeant who has many replacements to handle. <br />    Episode Five is in Holland as well. We focus on the current Captain of the comapany in this one and see a platoon take dike. <br />     Episode six is one of the most terrifying episodes there is. It is in Bastogne in the battle of the bulge where the 101 is surrounded. Medic Eugene Roe is the focus in the this one where we see how bad the casualties were in this battle and the sacrafices of the medics and women volunteers in the war. <br />    Episode 7. This one is the most sad one of the ten. We see many people we like die in shellings and a man break. The company takes a village. <br />    Episode eight. Tom Hank's son is in this one as a replacment Lieutenant who becomes friends with a privatein the company. The company is ordered by regiment to go across a river they are watching to take prisoners in a patrol. <br />     Episode nine. Easy Companys in Germany and some men who are out on patrol find a concentration camp. In this episode you will see many men who look so hardended by combat but that the concentration camp is too much from them. <br />      Episode ten. Easy Company takes Hitler Eagles Nest in this one and goes to Austria where they live a dream life. But they dont enjoy this too much because the division is going to Japan. <br />    Overall this is one miniseries and war movie you have to see. <br />
B00005Q4CS|5.0|There are few words to say about a film as brilliant and heart breaking as Darren Aronofsky's \\"Requiem For a Dream\\".  A cautionary tale of drug addiction and abuse, here, caught on a genius use of film, is also a story of the destruction of hope and how terribly horrific hope can actually be.  Blowing his debut \\"Pi\\" straight out of the water, Darren Aronofsky has created probably the most brilliant piece of film to come around in such a long time.  For \\"Requiem For a Dream\\", hell has never looked so god-forsaken and beautiful at the same time.
0316172324|1.0|I can't remember the last time that finishing a book caused the feeling I had with Blink.  I was angry that I'd wasted the money to buy this book.   <br /> <br />It's not enough to say that this book is bad.  The flaw of this book is it's completely meaningless and irrelevant. And worse, it's boring.  Paint drying boring. <br /> <br />Gladwell's epiphany: humans make quick subconscious decisions that are often correct.  However, sometimes subconscious stereotypes can result in wrong decisions. Duh. <br /> <br />If my review can save two people the pain of purchasing and attempting to read this book, at least I will have gotten some value out of the book.
B000002LBH|5.0|It is probably one of the best albums of Smiths.  I have been wanting to buy this album for a long time.  I finally bought it and very glad that I did...

B000002UJQ|5.0|There are many Radiohead fans (and I've done this in the past), who recommend someone interested in Radiohead listen to \\"The Bends\\" first because it is more easy to digest, but the truth is that most of us fans started with \\"Ok Computer\\" and are simply not giving others the credit they deserve. <br /> <br />In my opinion, there are two types of people when it comes to Radiohead, those who get it and listen over and over again, each time finding a new favorite song, or those who don't. By starting someone out on the \\"soft\\" stuff you're not doing him or her any favor. If they really like it because of its pop appeal, they'll be sorely disappointed with the rest of Radiohead's albums and would be better off with straight out British pop albums from the likes of Coldplay, Keane, and The Stills (actually Canadian, but also very good). The truth is, if you don't like \\"Ok Computer,\\" you're probably not going to be a Radiohead fan. It is in many ways what everything led to and has since been derived from. Radiohead are well known for their interest in always changing, and they really have accomplished this throughout their career, but they are only human, and many of their newer albums can be considered the exploration of musical themes or ideas found somewhere in \\"Ok Computer.\\" It is a monstrous album, the high water mark of any great band, and while \\"The Bends\\" was important because it offered the possibility of a new wave of British music, \\"Ok Computer\\" showed there was no going back, the tracks were laid and the train was rolling. So if someone is interested in Radiohead, point him or her to this album. It worked for you, me, and millions of others.
B00000DGRX|5.0|If you're reading this review, you probably already know what a great hard-rock classic Deep Purple's \\"Machine Head\\" was and would like to know if this deluxe edition is worth the extra cash. Yes, it is! <br /> <br />Disc One contains the entire original \\"Machine Head\\" LP correctly sequenced, along with a non album B-side and two slightly different remixes of different songs done for the long out-of-print Quad version of the LP. To be honest, to my ears the Quad remixes don't sound noticably different unless I have stereo headphones on, but they're nice to have. <br /> <br />Disc Two contains what Deep Purple bassist Roger Glover modestly refers to as \\"subtle\\" remixes. Anything but! Glover strips away the studio sheen of the original songs, leaving the original intros and endings intact. Thus, for example, we hear the band warming up to play \\"Highway Star\\" and jamming till they suddenly stop at the end of \\"Smoke on the Water.\\" As you'd expect from a bass player-turned-remixer, Glover accentuates the bassier frequencies as a rule which lends these remixes a punch they didn't have in their better-known versions. Glover also substitutes previously mixed-out alternate versions of a couple of Blackmore's solos. While Ritchie Blackmore might not be delighted to hear the automobile sound effects returned to the climax of his \\"Highway Star\\" solo, lots of fans will be VERY pleased to hear bits and pieces of an alternate version of a classic album. <br /> <br />Some die-hard rockers might shudder at the word \\"remix,\\" fearing that drum machines or synths were added. Fear not. Not one new note has been re-recorded and flown in. Everything you hear in the remix existed on the master tapes, although it may not have made it to the final version of the album as eventually released. <br /> <br />If you're a Purple fan, get this. And, if you aren't, I wouldn't be surprised if it turns out you like the remixes even better than the originals.
B0007Z0OL8|5.0|I enjoyed this movie alot. The songs, the puppets, everything about this movie is funny. The sets are well done. The acting is good. Susan Sarandons' death is the funniest. I was laughing so hard my ribs hurt. Kim Jong Il looks like a bull dog with glasses. Also if you notice Matt Damon is similar to Timmy from South Park; which is also very funny. Get this movie, it's a guaranteed laugh out loud experience.
B000001BZT|4.0|Coming from Texas it always surprises me how few people are familiar with Steve Earle, but then when I name off some of the singers who have covered his material the same people haven't heard of those singers either ;)Steve's really not much of a singer himself, but like Dylan he turns his handicap into an asset.  He's certainly distinctive, and there's never a time when you don't believe in his utter conviction.  \\"Copperhead Road\\" is undoubtedly the best album Earle had put out since his breakthrough \\"Guitar Town\\", although there hadn't been much.  Perhaps a readthrough of \\"Hardcore Troubadour\\", Steve's biography, will give the proper background to what drives the man's lyrics.  It's worth reading even if you've heard Earle's music and already decided you didn't like it.  Suffice to say he's lived through some rough (largely self-inflicted) episodes in his day, and what emerges is an unflinching, yet soulful, look at the human condition.  Album opener \\"Copperhead Road\\" is a brilliant example of this, an outlaw ditty of the old school which compares the old moonshining days to the current meth lab and pot farm battles, even insinuating along the way that the narrator (who is picking up where his daddy's moonshine business left off) learned everything he knows about drugs while fighting in Vietnam.  Heady stuff.  There are two other major songs in Earle's repertoire which come from this album:  \\"The Devil's Right Hand\\" was originally penned back in the 70s and is a cautionary tale about violence:  \\"it gets you into trouble but it can't get you out\\".  Nonetheless, this isn't Sunday School preaching here; Earle realizes the allure of the old outlaw ways as well as the penalties, and his playing both sides of the argument that makes the tale much more convincing than it would have been if he were merely sermonizing.  The third song I mentioned is \\"Johnny Come Lately\\", a returned soldier ditty done up Irish jig style with the Pogues playing back up band.  The rest of thealbum is solid if insubstantial.  Many of Earle's love songs come across as fairly lightweight and middle of the road compared to his more topical work, but to his band's credit (and the producer's, of course) everything on here sounds great, at least if your idea of the way country music should sound is more Waylon Jennings than Rascall Flats.
B00005JNTX|3.0|I really thought this was going to be a pretty good one and it was going to take alot to convience me it wasnt great about less than halfway through it hit me this is not so good and thats how it was all the way through best way to decribe violence,nudity,weird and i like all of those things in a movie if done well,but this movie was i cant belive i would be saying this about this movie but boring.The 3 separet storylines didnt really intersect so it was never really intresting i was very disapointed I will give it three stars for originallity with the comic book look.I watched it on the DVD a was able to get an early copy(legally) just about every time someone speeks there is a high pitched ringing kind like when you have your ears checked its not my sound system was wondering if some else may have noticed this sound throughout the movie it is annoying.RENT especially if there is a special edition coming soon
B0007TKNL0|1.0|It went on forever.  I cringed every time the Phantom sang.  Surely Hollywood can find a better singer.  The whole production was miserably overblown.  Typically Hollywood!
B0006IIPIK|5.0|This is a great movie that also looks great with some funny moments I cant believe reviewers are so split on this its seems you like it or you dont I just saw Sin City And i have to say i liked Sky Captain better it just has a great story and the CGI lighting and effects are great a classic type of pattern from the 30's and 40's, BUY IT!
B0002F6BRE|2.0|alright I love Will but this movie got old fast... gross out humor is fine and overall doesn't bother me, some of the jokes wore thin 5 min into the film, I bought it thinking it would just be great and instead I fell asleep in the middle....... not what I was looking for... rent before you buy
B0009S4IHY|5.0|This was is a terrific movie very original as the front of the dvd says \\"Kill Bill meets Looney Toones\\" I would say thats accurate I knew this film would be good but didnt really expect to get cought up in it like a did.Besides for the the great fight scenes the cgi great but the characters are teffiffic.I've seen the dvd version already and its great the picture and sound are really good and also the special features include a 30 min. interview with director Stephen Chow for american audiences plus a 45 min making of documentary,Really good stuff Buy IT.
B0000TB01Y|3.0|Though the musical can not even begin to have the sophistication of the SUPERB book by Gregory McGuire, it is great fun.  Though the original cast is good, the current broadway cast (Shoshana Bean as Elphaba, Megan Hilty as Glinda, Ben Vereen as The Wizard...) is a cast I wish I could have a recording of.  Shoshana Bean blows Idina Menzel out of the water...her voice is more stable in all registers and her acting is far superior.  I'm okay with spending $15 on the CD with Idina but I'd never have paid $200 for a ticket for her...Shoshana I plan to see at least 2 more times in NYC.
B00005JNTX|5.0|I came into the theater not knowing what to expect, having never read any of the comic books (in fact, I didn't even know it was a comic book at the time), and I was enthralled.  The sets, the characters, and the CGI were all outstanding.  Sin City grabs you from the initial scene and drags you into a world of crime, corruption, and prostitution, and by the time its over you have to shake to remind yourself that you're back in the real world.   <br /> <br />Almost the entire film is in deep, dark black and piercingly bright white, you really feel like you're in a comic book.  The occasional color is only used for emphasis (kind of like Snoop Dogg's \\"Drop It Like It's Hot\\" video), and it works, on so many different levels.  While a little confusing at times, this movie reminds me a little of the Max Payne Video Game series, with the constant narration and graphic violence.  I recommend this film to anyone who likes comic books, graphic violence, or just wants to see a great story and interesting characters.
B00000G3CK|4.0|An excellent look at how genius borders insanity.  Not only does the main character, Max, posses great intelligence, but he is also very wary of those around him (with good cause). The supporting characters portray all that is ugly in society when a key to possibly unlock wealth and power is presented to them.  Twists and turns on what Max debates is real and what is hallucination show the inner struggle of a genius searching for an answer.  Max fights for what he thinks he wants, but in the end realizes that not having all the answers is a saner way to live.
B0009HLDFU|1.0|I don't blame this on the corporation I blame the Foo Fighters. I guess they don't have enough money. Tell me this. If I buy this CD then decide to sell it what then? Screw that. I won't burn the next guy. And I just don't want to support musicians like that. I can't identify with that kind of mentality so I don't identify them.
B000002LND|5.0|This is a must have for those seeking as much older Madonna music as they can get for the money.  It is 17 tracks strong, with hit after hit.  If you don't have these songs already, buy this.
0975991477|5.0|I found this book to be an exciting read! Although some of the material is fairly technical, Lipton presents it in a style that catches your interest and makes it hard to put down.Great for getting a grasp on the changing paradigm of biolological thinking!
B000002NJS|5.0|Another great album from Madonna.  It is not as happy as some of her earlier work.  She explored a different style here, but it is not bad by any means.  Just a different vibe.  Some of it has a hypnotic feel to it.  You might like is as much as I do.  Check it out!
B00005JLR2|3.0|This movie is a futuristic adaptation of \\"Treasure Island\\", complete with extreme skateboarding/snowboarding.  The various space creatures that make up the crew of the ship are interesting and just scary enough to keep the attention of small children.    This is definitely not in the same league as \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" and \\"Snow White\\", but it is still a fun movie.  Children under 10 will enjoy it.  For adults, it's not that bad.  I didn't mind watching it, but it's not something I would pick for myself.      There is a lot of action and strange charatcters, and everything works out fine in the end for most of the \\"good guys\\".  There are some people who die, but actual death occurs off camera, so as not to be too upsetting for the children.    This is a solid 3 star movie, but is probably a 4+ star film for small children.
B00008S2VG|5.0|This one is different, that is true.  It is just Madonna reinventing herself again.  But we all know and have come to love her, so we will give her a chance, right?  I gave this album a chance and am happy that I did.  It has more good songs than just the song from Die Another Day.  Get your hands on this album and enjoy it!
B000002KKS|5.0|Heaven and Hell is pure Heaven! The best Sabbath album<br /><br />ever! Sorry to all the Ozzy fan's out there but it's true.<br /><br />Ronnie James Dio has made his mark on Sabbath and Rainbow.<br /><br />Those bands were never the same after he left. His solo<br /><br />career proved his awesome talent. His unique voice stands<br /><br />out as one of the best of all time. Songs like Children of<br /><br />the sea, Heaven & Hell and Die Young are classics. This is<br /><br />by far the best hard rock album of the 80's. Buy it now!!!
B00005JNSK|4.0|Time Burton does it again with his trademark gothic and bizarre movie backdrops. One cannot deny the dark imagery and the visual effects that make the film a Burton production -- the irony and the dysfunctions of his characters that are played out with each child and their relationship with their parents.  This is the core issue in the film as well as for Wonka's personality; Wonka cannot even say the word p-a-r-e-nt.  The landscape of the film almost depicts a time that has long passed -- the Cold War imagery of espionage, stealing the Wonka candy formula.  The film has traits from past Burton films, such as EDWARD SCISSORHANDS and BIG FISH as well as from other twisted fictitious narratives, LEMONY SNICKET, and forgive me, THE CAT IN THE HAT.  Johnny Depp presents a unique Willy Wonka with his somewhat androgynous appearance that has been suggestive as a cross between the \\"King of Pop\\" and Carol Channing. Burton follows the same plotline as the original CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY film, WILLY WONKA AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY and stays true to Roahl Dhal's novel as well as a few extras that explain Wonka's childhood.<br /><br />CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY by all means does not follow the musical giddiness of the original movie with memorable numbers, such as \\"The Candyman,\\" \\"Pure Imagination,\\" and \\"I've Got a Golden Ticket.\\"  However, the Oompa loompa numbers somewhat fill the void, and proceeds the same as the WILLY WONKA film where each child is eliminated from the factory tour.  The most delicious scene throughout the film is the Wonka chocolate bar, and the river full of hot chocolate amidst the edible green hilly pastures with its cherry candy trees and puffy whipped cream -- how yummy.<br /><br />Overall, the film will indeed entertain and enchant each viewer.  It is appropriate for children eight years-old and older.  However, children under eight years-old should be accompanied with an adult because of particular situations and references that are mentioned in the film that they may not understand.in the film that they may not understand.
B00062ZE3U|3.0|To start of with a quick note, I don't understand how anyone could really compare Evanescence to WT. Maybe I'm just daft, but I don't see many similarities, and like another reviewer said, it's like trying to compare Nightwish to Evanescence; they're not even in the same GENRE. I'm not insulting Evanescence in any way (though I don't really care for them), but I just wanted to say that... <br /> <br />Silent Force really brings a different aspect of WT to the table. I'm not quite sure how to feel about it yet, considering that I didn't really even like Mother Earth until a few listens (and now I'm obsessed with it). But from what I can tell, this album lacks... I don't want to say emotion, but I think that's the word I'm going to have to go with. There was something so ethereal and touching about Mother Earth that is missing in Silent Force. This album is definitely less opera and celtic oriented, which disappointed me. And I can't believe that Sharon's voice was toned down on this album. That was one of the things that I really loved about WT. <br /> <br />In short, no, this album is not as good as Mother Earth. I guess Silent Force has its good points, but the mediocre weigh out the good by far. Do I think that WT sold out? No; I think that this is more of an experimentation than a sell-out. Or at least, I hope, especially for my own piece of mind because I would be heart-broken if this was the direction that WT chose to follow in the future. The sound is different, Sharon is NOT demonstrating the vocal range that so captivated me previously, and... though Silent Force might have better sound quality, Mother Earth beats out Silent Force by eons lyrically and vocally (I mean, some of the lyrics don't even make sense in Silent Force).  <br /> <br />Conclusion: The best production studio in the universe can never even begin to make an apt substitute for substance and feeling.
B000002UYZ|4.0|I really like this CD.  I love singing along to the Beatle songs I used to sing along to when I was a teenager.  This is very close to having a Best of CD.  There are a few songs I wish were on the CD but I really enjoy the songs it does have.
0553208845|5.0|A very good novel which drives you into deep thinking about life experience. For those who are busy all time in earning a living, it is a very good inspiration for you to review life and living.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This series is excellent and the only problem that it had was its relation to FOX. Buy it, watch it, love it, and hope that FOX notices and restarts it.
0425156842|4.0|A very good novel, which introduces a concise view of western philosophy development within an amazing story.
0393317552|3.0|This book presents a very insightful look into the development of mankind across the globe.  Overall I enjoyed the book, but I have to say that number one, the author has lost his scientific objectivity.  His theories about human social development and its link to early agriculture are persuasive.  However, the author is so committed to his theories that he appears to have lost his objectivity.  For example, case studies involving isolated populations are used to draw global conclusions.  Some of the hypotheis are circular and self-fulfilling.  The link of the development of human societies to agriculture is oversimplified and the author completely ignores many other factors that common sense tells us must have shaped human history.  But the author seems to feel that every aspect of social development across the globe can be explained by the presence or absence of certain cultivatable plants in various regoions of the world.  Second, the book is way too long.  The message could have been delivered in a few chapters.  The author has a bad habit of simply rehashing the same idea over and over in the various chapters of the book, without really adding anything new.  I got frustrated and bored and had to put the book down after ready two-thirds of it.  Despite the complaints, the book is very interesting and I believe the author makes some very compelling points and the book is well written.  Its just too long and a little one-sided.
B0007GAERG|4.0|I thought the CD was aight when I first heard it. Then My mom bought it (I don't buy CD's anymore), and the CD kinda grew on me. She wanted me to burn it for her at first, and I was like(I not wasting my time dowloading,and using my CDs for maybe what,  5 good songs.) So she went out and bought it. To my surprise the CD is pretty cool. I mean it aint no Beyonce or no Ciara, but its a nice chill to CD. Unfortunetly Im starting to get burned out on the CD b/c my Mom plays it so much. (I'm glad someone loves it that much)!!! In overall the CD is good, and it would be money well spent (that is if you buy CDs) to get.  <br /> <br />Peace........~Lata~
0812550706|3.0|This book has consistently received high praise.  Too much in my opinion.  Its ok, but not great.  The thing that I think bothered me about it was that the main characters were children (super genetically enhanced children, but children nonetheless).  These kids are put in charge of fighting a galactic war for the planet because they are smarter than everyone else.  That just never struck me as plausible and bothered me throughout the book.  Kids will never be put in charge of defending our planet from galactic invaders I don't care how clever they are.  Maybe other readers are ok with that, because it makes for an interesting story.  But, I have to have a lot of realism and plausibility in my sci-fi or it doesn't work for me.
B00005JLXE|1.0|k, I hated this film I really did, but I want to hear your opinion, if you agree with me(that this is a bad movie) press \\"yes\\" if you dont press \\"no\\".
B0007OCG56|1.0|A more hamfisted and subtly misogynistic treatment of race/class relations in modern US one could not hope to find. Very silly, very unnecessary.  <br />Interested in hispanic immigration to US? Watch Maria Full of Grace, or the documentary Farmingville, and go from there. Don't touch this with a barge pole.
0316172324|5.0|Is it true a fake can produce intuitive revulsion in the eye of a knowing observer? A blink is a glance, fast and frugal decisionmaking.  <br /> <br />The truth of a marriage can be understood by an observer in a short time. A relationship between people has a distinctive signature.  <br /> <br />Free will is an illusion. We can be coached, primed. Gladwell speaks of thin-slicing, the process of making decisions quickly on the basis of very little information. When you start second-guessing you may be undermining yourself. Sometimes extra information just confuses the issue.  <br /> <br />Thin slicing is recognizing patterns and making snap judgments. It turns out that buying jam is a snap decision. Less choice means more sales. The face is an enormously rich source of emotion. Every blink is a series of discrete moving parts.  <br /> <br />Music auditions are thin slicing moments. The use of screens, blind auditions, has changed the composition of orchestras.  <br /> <br />The notes at the end of the book are of great interest.
B00005YU1O|5.0|Great, stimulating, thought provoking piece of work.  brings out the questions of life we all think about. I watched it 3 times in 24 hours.
B0008ISM40|5.0|Tangible artistry attracts doubters and cynics in every time and in every discipline. \\"With Teeth\\" is Trent Reznor's latest work, but by no means his last. He releases it in an atmosphere where professional critics and common skeptics can't wait to tear down an established artist of the last decade. I've read many reviews of this record, both professional and otherwise. Some make valid points. Others embarrass their purpose. What I will say is that when it comes to this artist, I suspend my cynicism on small gripes and indulge my attraction to the larger beauty. I for one am not willing to take a place on the wrong side of music history. In terms of the ability to minipulate sound into a precise and beautiful intent, Mr. Rezor is a composer that deserves the long-term perspective.  <br /> <br />If your only exposure to NIN is dancing with your sorority sister at the club to \\"'Frak' you like an animal\\"(a great song, BTW), then stop here. But if you have half a brain and can appreciate the journey of an artist reaching for his destiny, then by all means BUY THIS CD. Peace. <br />
0446677450|2.0|Although I found a lot of this material of interest, the author had a way of presenting it in a manner that was offensive in nature.  Continually he made it sound as if the middle class were stupid for living their lives the way they do.  he made huge assumptions that everyone in the world has made any effort to be wealthy.  It was hard to get past his sheer arrogance.   <br /> <br />I would be hesitant to recommend this book since the info revealed was skimpy.  Mostly he talked about his his rich father badmouthed his poor father for getting an education and contributing to society.
B000055Y0X|5.0|A Kubrick MASTERPIECE!!  Doesn't get much better than this!  If you like Peter Sellers or Stanley Kubrick, YOU'LL LOVE THIS!
B0007XT7V8|5.0|all i can say for theory of a deadmans new cd is one word...awesome!! this is a cd that you'll listen to from beginning to end and then again.
B00000JPYD|5.0|Phenomenal sound.  Great new additions w/ live perfomances.  Better than I remembered from the mid-70's!  HIGHLY recommended for guitar enthusiasts.  A CLASSIC!
B0000C0FJB|1.0|First of all, I'm very glad I did not buy this (I got it from my public library).  If I had, I assure you, I would have vigorously pursued all available channels for obtaining a full refund.  This is absolute garbage and should never have been released. <br /> <br />I borrowed this a couple of nights ago and listened to it for the first time in my car on the way to work this morning.  I was quite excited, a new, career-spanning three-disc live set from one of my favorite bands, with hits, crowd favorites, and rarities all well-represented. <br /> <br />I've got an afer-market CD-changer in the car, and at first I thought I had the radio tuned to the wrong setting, the sound was that muddy.  Then I thought perhaps there was something wrong with my equipment.  Then I figured I just had a bad or damaged copy of the set. <br /> <br />I made sure I read a whole bunch of reviews before I posted my own, in case my experience was some sort of fluke.  Apparently it was not.  Many have commented on the poor sound quality (and this goes beyond being a bad mix, my guess is that the original board recordings were very poorly done). <br /> <br />I am absolutely astounded by the number of four and five star ratings here.  I am a prolific collector of audience recordings of such bands that allow such (Allman Brothers, Grateful Dead and off-shoots, Gov't Mule, various \\"jambands,\\" etc.).  I have not heard a live recording this poor in years.  This sounds like something from some 1969 Hendrix show where a college kid snuck a bulky mono cassette recorder into the theater in his bookbag (and left the recorder in the bookbag). <br /> <br />If this were on my trading list, the comments would be along the lines of \\"barely listenable/not recommended.\\" <br /> <br />With tapers running the gamut from rank amateur to seasoned professional, and equipment ranging from pocket-size mini disc recorders to ten-thousand dollar 24-bit recording rigs, you never know what you're going to get with an audience recording. <br /> <br />However, when buying a commercially released \\"official\\" live recording, fans have the right to demand certain standards of quality.  I have no idea how the band could in good conscience release such an inferior product.  One reviewer titled his review - Good music, too bad you can't hear it - or something like that.  I'd have to agree. <br /> <br />Do not buy this without listening first.
B0000214F0|1.0|Bet you thought you'd never hear me say that!<br /><br />Most troublesome aspect of the sex scenes is that they were edited in the same choppy style that MTV uses--except this movie was made before MTV even existed.<br /><br />Story concerns Caligula's rise to power, his search for a wife, his cruelty, his growing insanity, and his richly deserved end.<br /><br />Yes, there are many beautiful, all-natural girls in this movie, but as I said, they're filmed so erratically that you never get a feel for their overall appearance.<br /><br />However, Teresa Ann Savoy, who plays Drusilla, is the most beautiful of all, and her scenes are richly filmed.<br /><br />Final word, though--save your money.
1557507473|4.0|I would have given this book 5 stars if the detail provided about Peleliu had been the same for Okinawa. I ordered this book because of a conversation I had with a veteran of both battles. This veteran is Jack Vargo, PFC with the 1st Marines.(or maybe the amphib force, I'm not sure.)<br /><br />I was a little unhappy with the Okinawa portion because I was stationed there from 1961 to 1963 ( and ,incidentally made my first mission into Vietnam on 2 Jan 1962) and saw many of the shore battery positions and walked the coral bottoms of the cliffs where so many Japanese and Okinawans committed suicide by jumping off.<br /><br />In support of the book, Jack commented that Sledge had definitely got the facts right. Particularly the part about the flies clinging to you so thick that you had to scrape them off.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone for its historical basis and it is now in my library in that section.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />R.P. Taylor<br /><br />MAJ (ret) USA
B00009VTX8|4.0|I really liked this Western. Sharon Stone plays the Clint Eastwood role of a stranger riding into town (Redemption) with vengeance on her mind.  Her nemesis is a cruel gunslinger / town owner called John Herod, who controls Redemption with an iron first. The Sharon Stone character participates in a fast-draw competition hosted by John Herod, and many different participants shoot it out with each other. The fastest person to stay alive wins and receives the bounty. The colorful characters include Herod's son, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, who tries to be the fastest draw comparable to his father;  the Preacher (played by Russell Crowe), who is a deadly gunslinger who takes a vow of non-violence and strikes a friendship with Stone;  Ace Harlon, a fast-draw participant played by Lance Henricksen;  and Sgt. Cantrell, a hired gunhand played by Keith David. Gene Hackman plays John Herod in a way that is reminiscent of the cruel sheriff in \\"Unforgiven.\\"   <br /> <br />Other reviewers have done a great job of describing the plot in more detail so I won't repeat it here.  What I'd like to comment on is how this movie plays homage to several of Sergio Leone's movies, especially \\"Once upon a Time in the West\\" and \\"A Fistful of Dollars.\\"  Sharon Stone's character Ellen is haunted by flashbacks of her past in the cruel murder of her father by Herod (reminiscent of Once upon a Time in the West's flashbacks of Charles Bronson's character and his past with Henry Fonda).  There is a deadly and climactic confrontation between Ellen and Herod, reminiscent of \\"A Fistful of Dollars\\";  there's a bit of \\"High Plains Drifter\\" thrown in, as the female gunfighter emerges from the smoke from the town ablaze, to confront her foe.     <br /> <br />I thought that Sharon Stone did a very commendable job, playing a female gunfighter.  Her character is interesting in that on the one hand, she is a deadly and coolheaded gunfighter, yet on the other, she still is haunted by her fears in her past as agirl who stood by helplessly when her father was being killed. I can't picture another actress who can play this role with such charisma and believability as Stone.  <br /> <br /> <br />Even though the plot is very simple, what made this movie most interesting (besides having a female gunfighter) is the collage of different interesting characters who participate in the competition.  I also appreciated Sam Raimi's direction and the many inventive camera shots of the gun duels (e.g. the donut-sized holes in a person's head after he gets shot).   <br /> <br /> <br />I agree that this movie deserved much better than what the critics gave it.  I believe that over time it will be respected as an original and inventive homage to the Spaghetti Western.  I hope they make a sequel to this movie with another female gunslinger being the heroine.
B00008H2LB|1.0|Linkin Park has released their next amazing album! That's right, amazingly s&**$y! I still don't understand how people call this trash music.<br /><br />The lyrics are terrible! Chester Bennington tries to write good lyrics to show he is an intelligent man, but he fails miserably. Instead of sounding good, he ends up sounding like a whiney 7 year old who can't get his way. He says his life sucks...\\"I'm so rich, and my band is one of the biggest bands in the world, it's so terrible, I just want to take back my life!!!\\" Idiot.<br /><br />The music is just as bad. The guitar is just one riff played over and over with a remix to add \\"diversity\\", the bass isn't heard, the drums are the sound of what ypu'd get if you threw drum parts on the wall, and don't get me started on the DJ...<br /><br />I bet none you stupid Linkin Crap fans have ever heard of Nile. They have only THREE, yes THREE, members in their band, and they have more talent in their nuts than everyone in LP combined! Their song \\"Unas: Slayer Of The Gods\\" has an amazing intro that has more complexity, thought, and intelligence then every Linkin Park song combined.<br /><br />Here's an idea: listen to real music like Dream Theater, Sprial Architect (WARNING: The bassist in this band can be heard and you might not be able to take it, but if you talk tarsh about this band you will truly regret it), Opeth, Death, Meshuggah, Carcass, Manowar, Napalm Death, Dying Fetus, Mayhem, Venom, Emperor, Testament, Iron Maiden, Black Sabbath, Judas Priest, Sepultura, Slayer, Megadeth, Anthrax, Metallica (hell, even the new stuff is better than this garbage!), In Flames, Iced Earth, Blind Guardian, etc. I could go on, but my hands are getting tired. Oh yeah, one last thing: f*** Linkin Park!
B000001FDQ|5.0|This is the ULIMATE guitar album. Every track is amazing. Malmsteen's playing is incredible, and I highly recommend Rising Force to any fan of metal, classic rock, or just natural talent. <br /> <br />TRACK BY TRACK: <br /> <br />1. BLACK STAR 10/10: A great opener to a complete shred fest record. The acoustic intro is great, and leads right into an awesome eerie series of solos. <br /> <br />2. FAR BEYOND THE SUN 20/10: One of the best songs ever written by ANYONE, ever. An amazing masterpiece. My favorite song on the cd. <br /> <br />3. NOW YOUR SHIPS ARE BURNED 9/10: A great, catchy song. One of the two songs with vocals. Also has a great verse. <br /> <br />4. EVIL EYE 9/10: Again, a great instrumental piece with many intricate solos, and some nice acoustic parts. <br /> <br />5. ICARUS DREAM SUITE 9.5/10: Another absolute masterpiece, along with Far Beyond The Sun. <br /> <br />6. AS ABOVE, SO BELOW 10/10: The other track with vocals. Has VERY catchy verses and choruses. And as always amazing solos. Very well done---my second favorite track on the cd. <br /> <br />7. LITTLE SAVAGE 8/10: Drums open this track. An awesome riff for a pretty good song overall. <br /> <br />8. FAREWELL 9/10: A cool outro track, and the end to a classic album filled with some of the best guitar I have ever heard.

B00005JNDZ|1.0|I was and I am still crazy about the first movie of Bridget Jones: I have watched it more than 10 times on DVD. I can laugh and cry with her every single time. And there were so many moments that you feel that she were just you in the real life and have no way out. The screenplay was so well written, even much better than the original fiction in a reasonable funny drama way. All the characters in the movie are so outstanding, also the music; dialogue...perfect! It makes you want to watch it over and over again and never feel bored. <br /> <br />But this one? (sigh...) Is that how UK movie try comedy? Maybe they should stick to their old gun. At some stage, I was thinking maybe it was a bad idea for them to make the second movie for Bridget Jones out of the second fiction. Or should I say, I expected too much? Put in this way, it is more like just an ordinary UK comedy! With exaggerated drama, boring screenplay, over weight character, custom and music...I feel sorry for Bridget. It looks like everyone (mainly the director and the screenplay writer) just want to make fun out of her as much they can. There is no touching moment any more. Even when Mark asked her to marry him at the end, I didn't feel anything at all.  <br /> <br />When I read the second book of Bridget, I thought the only storyline in it can match with the first book and the movie is how Bridget deal with this new, long waited relationship, how she build up the trust and commitment with Mark after all they have been through in their previous life. In the book, Mark did have had some affair with Rebecca, but back to Bridget eventually. However, in the movie, Rebecca has been changed into a lez and the whole thing that Mark has an affair was just a joke. The only sophisticated part left over in the second book has been left out in the movie. Well, it is good in a comedy and drama way. I had a good laugh in the cinema, too. But not in a natural way, and there is nothing left on my mind as soon as the screen started to show the credits at the end. <br /> <br />I asked lots of people around me who have seen the second one: Those ones who only watched the second movie said it is a funny comedy. Those ones who watched both of them, but mainly under age 25, said they liked the second one more, because it is funny. Those ones who watched both but more mature told me they think it might not even worth to compare the second one with the first one...Maybe that explains!  <br />
B0009UC7H0|5.0|I thought this was an excellent movie.  Lots of action, adventure, and humor.   <br /> <br />The movie is based on a best selling book by Clive Cussler.  While parts of the book were dropped due to time constraints, I thought it still followed the book as well as can be expected.  Lead actor Matthew McConaughey did a great impression of Dirk Pitt.  Hopefully they will make many more.
B000002ITM|4.0|Strange that 3 or 4 people wrote a review of this old disc on the same damn day!!! guess we were all listening and remembering how great this band and cd were.. strange? yes! wrong? HELL NO!! this cd  only shows a bit of this bands depth. they, and many fans, will say this cd was weak or \\"experimental\\". but its just cleaner production and a ballad or 2. i was kinda disappointed to see them totally switch directions on their next cds to please the so called \\"fan base\\" who i doubt are listening or taking the time to write!! What this cd is is a classic. And im obviously not the only one who still listens to it after almost 15 years!! ask yourself this: will you be listening to the same crap in 15 years? this cd stands the test of time. a lesson in execution!
B0009P42SC|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie and I really can't add much that hasn't been covered in other positive reviews.  I found the movie to be entertaining and technically well done.  The animation and audio quality of the movie are pretty good.  I thought the music score was outstanding.  Perhaps more than any other animated film I have ever seen this movie feels like a live action film and not an animated film.  Some may see that as a problem.  I personally do not.  This is the kind of movie I could show to people not familiar with anime without feeling embarassed.  The movie does have its problems.  The story is perhaps average and there is little character development.  Don't expect this movie to be Akira II or Son of Akira.  This movie is more like the Rocketeer than anything.  This movie does have a message (or messages).  This is a \\"message\\" movie about the nature of technology and its use (or possible misuse).  Messages are subtle though.  Otomo doesn't feel the need in this movie beat you over the head with his point.  I personally like it that way. <br /> <br />I should mention that both the subtitled and english dubbed versions run the same length (126 minutes).  There are no cuts to the dubbed version.  That of course has been a worry to some since the theatrical dubbed version had a number of big cuts to its running time.  You do not have to worry about that with the R1 DVDs.  BTW, I found the dub to be pretty good.
B000001GQR|5.0|This artwork has been always considered an admirable musical breakthrough in the musical career of Franz. The epic breath, the free spirit of the Viennese spirit over passed  the formal precincts of the ancient academicism.<br /><br />Creative powers' Schubert  elevate to unsuspected spheres, somehow forewarned in his previous Symphony. His profound admiration for Ludwig van Beethoven established in his inner conscious the imperative need to abandon the previous restrictions of his previous Symphonic works. And he did it.<br /><br />There have been too many recordings in the market but ironically just a very few successful. To my view, F&uuml;rtwangler's 15 the September 1953 with the Berlin Philharmonic is still a standout, but there are worthy readings such Toscanini's Philadelphia, Rudolf Kempe, Mengelberg's Concertgebouw  and Istvan Kertesz's Vienna Philharmonic<br /><br />But F&uuml;rtwangler confers this work, greatness, epic stature and cosmic breath. This recording is a true historic document.!
B00003CXAA|5.0|All right Godfather and Godfather II are two of the greatest movies ever put on the screen.  The third one has so many different opinions that it doesn't pay to go into it.  i am here to rate the set not the movies. <br /> <br />Anyone getting this set will go for a couple of things: Quality of transfer to DVD and the bonus disc extras. <br /> <br />The quality is superb.  I watched this set on some state of the art systems as well as some truly archaic systems and its quality is as good as your equipment.  Both audio and video transfer came off well. <br /> <br />The extra disc is also awesome.  It is full of interviews, family trees, director commentary, deleted scenes, etc.  I wish it could have gone on and on but it had to end somewhere.  It gives you a more than fair portion for all of these categories. <br /> <br />This is a set that movie collectors should own.  I am assuming people that want to buy this set have seen the movies already.  If not rent them first and decide if you like the movies themselves before buying the collection.
B00005JNQA|5.0|Filmed in the superb building of the ONU, this film has overthrown possibly all the similar films, due its absorbing character.<br />A President of an African nation, has developed behind this mask of victim role, a very well built stage to trick the whole world his countless murederers beneath the well known argument of the National Security.<br />There are so many analogies with many nations in the world pitifully, but this compelling film focuses about not only the gradual process of political puzzle, but its inner and even outer consequences; that's the case in Silvia Brome who has lived the hell before her eyes, and tries by all means to guarantee the peace and the justice in her beloved country.<br />The long arm of the policial investigation will come perhaps with certain delay, and so meanwhile we will be the silnet witeness of a turbulent web of scandal, corruption, double cross and betray of the highest order.<br />Sean Penn will be the assigned officer whose mission will be working out as the bodyguard of Silvia while certain facts don't fit in her previous confession. She states she listened a whisper in which she has known about a possible attempt of homicide on the figure of the President, but someone watchs her and the tension acqires a multidimensional complexity.<br />Sidney Pollack made at last a solid, realist and passionate drama without restrictions playing hard with such script loaded of violence and undeniable actuality.<br />Don't miss it under any circumstance this overhelming picture!
B000002UE9|1.0|I have no problem with a band that dresses up a bit as long as they have talent.  Poison is not one of those bands.  They have the mentality of adolescent junior high-school horn dogs.  If you want to hear a good eighties band, listen to the Police or U2.
B000002LLC|5.0|Also served as the music inspired from the film Dick Tracy. Released in 1990. Copies sold:- 8,000,000. <br /> <br />It was quite obvious by this point in Madonna's career that she'd become an icon of the 80s. She'd released five albums, three that hit the top, many hit singles, and changed her image half way through the process which lead to the biggest-selling studio album of her career! (True Blue) I'm Breathless was Madonna's second sound-track, her first was Who's That Girl, which also included other artists. This was Madonna's first sound-track where all of the tracks were performed/sung by her. It includes the hits Vogue and Hanky Panky.  <br /> <br />1. He's A Man (4:44). 10/10 <br />2. Sooner Or Later (3:20). 10/10 <br />3. Hanky Panky (3:59). #10 in the US. 10/10 <br />4. I'm Going Bananas (1:44). 9/10 <br />5. Cry Baby (4:06). 9/10 <br />6. Something To Remember (5:06). 10/10 <br />7. Back In Business (5:13). 10/10 <br />8. More (4:58). 9/10 <br />9. What Can You Lose? (2:09). 9/10 <br />10. Now I'm Following You (Part 1) (1:35). 10/10 <br />11. Now I'm Following You (Part 2) (3:18). 10/10 <br />12. Vogue (4:49). #1 in the US. 10/10 <br /> <br />I'm Breathless is a very different approach for Madonna, but it's still a unique and brilliant Madonna effort. After seeing the film, I had high expectations for the sound-track, and this album surpassed those expectations! My favourite tracks from the album are definately Vogue, Hanky Panky and Something To Remember. Vogue is the biggest hit from the album, which peaked at #1 in both the UK and the US. In the US, the single even went 2x Platinum. Hanky Panky peaked at #10 in the US, which I was quite suprised by, and #2 in the UK, and is a song about the joy of spanking, which I find rather humurous! I was first introduced to Something To Remember by her 1995 ballad compilation, and was pleasantly suprised to find it on here. Serious Madonna fans (like me) will want this album straight away, but casual fans may want to buy her other albums first.
B000063JZQ|3.0|I just finished watching this movie half an hour ago and I was partly disappointed. First and foremost, the screenplay (by director Roman Polanski and renowned critic Kenneth Tynan) was too chopped up, and scenes/dialogue were moved around, as it was with Franco Zeffirelli's version of \\"Hamlet\\" (see my review on it). Leave that to Sir Laurence Olivier and Kenneth Branagh. See my reviews on their films, see them yourselves (I don't care which you do) and you'll bloody well see why I say so.<br /><br />Secondly, the acting isn't what I expected, due in part to the cutting of the text (good job of crediting Shakespeare at the beginning, by the way; but you would've done better to put \\"Based on the play by William Shakespeare\\"). Thirdly, the severed hand at the beginning-WHAT THE BLOODY HELL WAS THAT? It DIDN'T MAKE BLOODY SENSE!! Fourthly, why were the witches naked, though it was implied? Fifthly, Duncan being present at the execution of the Thane Of Cawdor? Sixthly, the bloody ending. WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT? IT DIDN'T ADD A DAMN THING, ONLY ADDED TO THE MYSTERY, WHEN BY RIGHT, THERE SHOULD'VE BEEN NOTHING LEFT TO WONDER AT?  I could list the remaining items (very few, those that are left), \\"But let that be; that which the eye fears, when it is done to see.\\" If you like Shakespeare, this film isn't the best version (but it's by no means bad, as far as good Shakespeare goes) to begin your appreciation of The Bard, but it is well worth it. Forget the fact that it was produced by adult magazine giant \\"PLAYBOY,\\" headed by Hugh M. Hefner, who is credited as executive producer of the film, for there is no serious nudity (the only instances are Macduff's son shown naked while his mother bathes him and Lady Macbeth's sleepwalking scene-DIDN'T POLANSKI AND TYNAN READ THE BLOODY TEXT? IT PLAINLY SAYS:<br /><br />The following excerpt is taken from \\"MACBETH\\" Act V, Scene I.<br /><br />Gentlewoman<br /><br />Since his majesty went into the field, I have seen<br /><br />her rise from her bed, throw her night-gown upon<br /><br />her, unlock her closet, take forth paper, fold it,<br /><br />write upon't, read it, afterwards seal it, and again<br /><br />return to bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleep.<br /><br />READ THE WORDS, POLANSKI-RAPIST!! \\"THROW HER NIGHT-GOWN UPON HER.\\" I had no problem with the scene, since everyone slept in the nude back then, BUT TO IGNORE THE WORDS OF THE BARD?!!

Will someone PLEASE let me know if Orson Welles' black-and-white version is any good? I would to heaven that Sir Laurence Olivier/or Kenneth Branagh had brought this play to the screen, as only they can, in their own inimitable styles. The X and R ratings that hve been given to it were/are harsh, though I can understand people who can't stomach violence and nudity (though there really was very little in this movie; will somebody point out at what point exactly the witch flashes an innocent bystander?

B00005J6T0|5.0|Released in 1986. Copies sold:- 23,000,000. <br /> <br />True Blue was a big step for Madonna. She changed her image, and she also changed her music into an even more mature effort. Madonna also scored three Number one singles from the album, and they all reached the top five! True Blue is Madonna's biggest-selling studio album to date, and her second biggest-selling ever, only second to The Immaculate Collection! The five hits from this album are Live To Tell, Papa Don't Preach, True Blue, Open Your Heart and La Isla Bonita.  <br /> <br />1. Papa Don't Preach (4:29). #1 in the US. 10/10 <br />2. Open Your Heart (4:12). #1 in the US. 10/10 <br />3. White Heat (4:40). 10/10 <br />4. Live To Tell (5:52). #1 in the US. 10/10 <br />5. Where's The Party (4:21). 10/10 <br />6.

True Blue (The Color Mix). 10/10 <br />11. La Isla Bonita (Extended Version). 10/10 <br /> <br />True Blue is definately Madonna's best album out of her first three. Not only are the lyrics alot more mature and better, but the songs are also even funner to listen to. My favourites from the album are Open Your Heart, White Heat and La Isla Bonita. Open Your Heart and La Isla Bonita are great Madonna tracks, and will remain classics. Madonna dedicated White Heat to Jimmy Cagney because, years ago there was a film called White Heat, and Madonna has chosen some lines from the film by Jimmy himself and placed them into the beginning of this song! The last two tracks are only available with the re-mastered version, and the best remix out of the two is the La Isla Bonita one. Madonna also scored three UK number one singles from this album! (Papa Don't Preach, True Blue and La Isla Bonita.)
0385486804|5.0|When i read this book, it had a huge effect on me.  At first i thought Alex was just some stupid kid who wants to go on an adventure in the wild.  Bu it was so much more than that.  He went looking for something.  Soemthing that cannot be recognized.  He lived a happy life.  He went on a huge adventure with lots of risks and good things.  If my life were like his, im sure I'd die happy ust like him.  The last sentence was the most touching part of the entire story.  I would recommend this to everyone who can understand it <br />-Mike
B000002LND|5.0|Released in 1990. Copies sold:- 26,000,000. <br /> <br />The Immaculate Collection was Madonna's very first Greatest Hits compilation, released back 15 year ago. It's also Madonna's biggest selling album, shifting a somewhat massive 26 million copies to this day since it was first released. This collection of seventeen huge hits features eight Number ones (Vogue, Like A Prayer, Crazy For You, Papa Don't Preach, Open Your Heart, Live To Tell and Like A Virgin, Madonna's first number one single and Justify My Love, a new song at the time of the albums release), and includes a futhermore five top five hits. (Express Yourself, Cherish, La Isla Bonita, Material Girl and Lucky Star).  <br /> <br />1. Holiday (4:04). #16 in the US. 10/10 <br />2. Lucky Star (3:37). #4 in the US. 10/10 <br />3. Borderline (4:00). #10 in the US. 10/10 <br />4. Like A Virgin (3:11). #1 in the US. 10/10 <br />5. Material Girl (3:52). #2 in the US. 10/10 <br />6.

Justify My Love (4:59). #1 in the US. 10/10 <br />17. Rescue Me (5:32). #9 in the US. 10/10 <br /> <br />I honestly couldn't find a single bad track on this album! They are all so excellent and I think this album may be Madonna's best album for me. All seventeen songs are very powerful and all extremely strong, and most of them are some of the strongest of her whole career. Alot of the versions are remixed or edited in some way, but I prefer alot of the versions on here to the album versions anyway. The only tracks that are not remixed are Vogue, Justify My Love and Rescue Me, which are also excellent. My favourite tracks would have to be Crazy For You, Like A Prayer and Vogue. Crazy For You is a beautiful Madonna ballad, and Vogue is one of her best hits. It's a classic! Like A Prayer has always been one of my favourite Madonna songs, and the dance version on here is absolutely brilliant! I recommend this album to the die-hard Madonna fans, and if you are a beginner, this is yet another good place to start your Madonna catalogue.  <br />
0425098478|4.0|The book is great. My first advice: don't start reading or listening to it without some papers and a pen. Why? Because you will get some interesting ideas. Those ideas and notes will help you to create a method and after that will be easier to start being a \\"one minute manager\\".<br /><br />I bought the audio book version. It just takes 1 hour 40 minutes. The reader is very good.
B00005J6SZ|5.0|Released in 1984. Copies sold:- 20,000,000. <br /> <br />Like A Virgin was released a year after Madonna's debut, Madonna, but it has sold double more copies than that album! Like A Virgin is also a better album than her first, mainly because of the more mature lyrics. Madonna also scored her first number one single here, which was Like A Virgin. And she deserved it! This album is a Madonna classic which I recommend to any beginners or fans. Madonna also started gathering bigger hits from this album.  <br /> <br />1. Material Girl (4:01). #2 in the US. 10/10 <br />2. Angel (3:56). #5 in the US. 9/10 <br />3. Like A Virgin {3:38). #1 in the US. 10/10 <br />4. Over And Over (4:11). 10/10 <br />5. Love Don't Live Here Anymore (4:47). 10/10 <br />6. Dress You Up (4:01). #5 in the US. 10/10 <br />7. Shoo-Bee-Doo (5:17). 10/10 <br />8. Pretender (4:31). 10/10 <br />9. Stay (4:07). 10/10 <br />10. Like A Virgin (Extended Dance Remix) (6:08). 10/10 <br />11. Material Girl (Extended Dance Remix) (6:07). 10/10 <br /> <br />I rated ten of these songs ten points because I thought they were all brilliant, and I rated Angel nine because I didn't think it was lyrically as good as the other songs on the album. My favourite songs on this album are definately Dress You Up, Stay and Like A Virgin. Like A Virgin is a classic Madonna song and definately one of her best, and Dress You Up and Stay are extremely fun to listen to! Like her first album, the last two tracks on this one come only with the re-mastered version, and the remixes are worth hearing, even if the originals are better. Recommended!
B0006L16N8|4.0|The CD is excellent in my opinion. The only problem, which wasn't stated at the time of purchase, is that it will not play on some audio equipment such as car CD players, due to new anti-piracy protection. BUYER BEWARE!    I have a 2001 VW Golf and it doesn't play in my CD changer. Ironically, I've already put the CD on my iPod and will probably burn an illegal copy of the CD in order to get it to play in my car. Hopefully that will solve the problem.     It's another instance of ill-convceived technology that creates more problems than it solves. I've read of other technology that makes CDs (such as the new Foo Fighters and Dave Matthews Band) incompatible with iPods. see this article on Yahoo! news:  (...)    To sum it up: Coldplay rocks, record companies don't. Be careful.
B000002MFN|5.0|Released in 1992. Copies sold:- 6,000,000. <br /> <br />Erotica is one of Madonna's most under-rated albums, and when it was released 13 year ago, in 1992, the critics slammed the album! The album charted at #2 in both the US and the UK, but only managed to sell 6 million worldwide. Madonna also released her Sex Book round about the same time, which was more successful than this album, and she also released the Box Office film Body Of Evidence, which the critics also slammed. Erotica bagged up four hits in the US. (Erotica, Deeper And Deeper, Bad Girl and Rain.) Fever was a #6 smash in the UK and Bye Bye Baby peaked at a rather respectful #15 in Australia.  <br /> <br />1. Erotica (5:18). #3 in the US. 10/10 <br />2. Fever (5:00). 10/10 <br />3. Bye Bye Baby (3:56). 10/10 <br />4. Deeper And Deeper (5:33). #7 in the US. 10/10 <br />5. Where Life Begins (5:58). 10/10 <br />6. Bad Girl (5:23). #36 in the US. 10/10 <br />7. Waiting (5:47). 10/10 <br />8. Thief Of Hearts (4:54). 10/10 <br />9. Words (5:56). 10/10 <br />10. Rain (5:24). #14 in the US. 10/10 <br />11. Why's It So Hard (5:24). 10/10 <br />12. In This Life (6:23). 10/10 <br />13. Secret Garden (5:32). 10/10 <br /> <br />Erotica is yet another Madonna album where all of the songs are great, so I had to give all of the songs a ten. All of them are great and really strong and powerful, however, Did You Do It?, available on the explicit version of the album, is not very good, because Madonna hardly sings in it. The clean version is alot better! My favourite songs from the album have to be Erotica, Deeper And Deeper and Thief Of Hearts. Erotica is possibly the sexiest song ever released, and I love it! Deeper And Deeper is considered a fan favourite, and it's definately one of the best Madonna songs ever for me. Thief Of Hearts is definately the best unreleased song from the album. I love the lyrics and music used. (The music sounds like some of her older 80s hits!!) Madonna says \\"bitch\\" several times!! Eroticais definately one of my favourite Madonna albums, and it should have sold more than it did to date! I recommend Erotica highly to any Madonna fans!
B00005JMEW|5.0|The first thing you must know about the Kill Bill movies are that they are spoofing all the old westerns and martial arts films. the blood and gore are kept at a relatively decent rate mostly because the gore scenes are in animation. When watching this movie you will see the sherrif and his son, black and white scenes for some of the flashbacks and some martial arts that are reminders of Charlie Chan mixed with Crouching tiger Hidden Dragon. All in all it is a fun movie to watch but don't let any kid age 14 and under see it, they won't understand it and might find it a little scary.
B000002LGQ|5.0|Released in 1989. Copies sold:- 15,000,000. <br /> <br />After her remix compilation, You Can Dance, Madonna released Like A Prayer, which took her back to the top spot! Madonna hadn't had a Number one album since she released True Blue, three years back. Like A Prayer spanned five singles in the US, three of them which hit the top five. Madonna also scored her fifth Number one single, which was the title track, and remains a Madonna classic! She also sang the song recently on the Live 8 gig brilliantly! The five singles from the album are Like A Prayer, Express Yourself, Cherish, Keep It Together (not a single in the UK) and Oh Father, which wasn't released as a single until 1996, after the success of her ballad collection Something To Remember. Dear Jessie reached #5 in the UK.  <br /> <br />1. Like A Prayer (5:40). #1 in the US. 10/10 <br />2. Express Yourself (4:38). #2 in the US. 10/10 <br />3. Love Song (4:52). 9/10 <br />4. Til Death Do Us Part (5:16). 10/10 <br />5. Promise To Try (3:37). 10/10 <br />6. Cherish (5:03). #2 in the US. 10/10 <br />7. Dear Jessie (4:21). 10/10 <br />8. Keep It Together (5:03). #8 in the US. 10/10 <br />9. Oh Father (4:58). #20 in the US. 10/10 <br />10. (Pray For) Spanish Eyes (5:17). 10/10 <br />11. Act Of Contrition (2:19). 10/10 <br /> <br />Like A Prayer is a brilliant effort from Madonna. My favourite songs from the album are definately Like A Prayer, Cherish and Keep It Together. Like A Prayer is, as I said before, a brilliant Madonna song and a classic forever. Cherish is a brilliant song, and it's one of the few songs that got me into Madonna, and Keep It Together speaks of how your family is gold, and it's definately the albums best unreleased song! Love Song is a duet with Prince, and is probably Like A Prayer's weakest moment, and the last track, Act Of Contrition, is Like A Prayer playing backwards. It's very weird, but I enjoyed it nevertheless. Madonna's prayers answered! Buy this now!
B0009HLDFU|5.0|If you people would just buy a Macintosh, you wouldn't have to worry about stupid workarounds for the copy protection. I was able to load this album into iTunes no problem and am able to play it on my iPod and Shuffle. Awesome! <br /> <br />Both discs are great, by the way. Especially the acoustic disc. I Highly recommend this album.
B000000993|5.0|No other band can match the feeling you get when listening to Tool. The hollow yet full feeling (a paradox yes... but it's truly what I feel when I hear listen to this and other Tool albums) is something that no other band duplicate. Their lyrics, their sounds, and their rhythms all add to one collective atmosphere. This CD above any of their others truly represents the atmosphere they strive for. It can be argued that possibly Aenima, Lateralus, or Opiate are better CD's (Maybe I'm wrong, everybody has a different favorite), but this is the CD that solidified the \\"Tool sound.\\" <br /> <br />This CD pushes randomness to the perfect point where you are actually a little creeped out by some of the things they tell you. A perfect example is the last song Disgustipated, with lines such as: <br /> <br />\\"And the angel of the lord came unto me, snatching me up from my place of slumber. And took me on high, and higher still until we moved to the spaces betwixt the air itself. And he brought me into a vast farmlands of our own midwest. And as we descended, cries of impending doom rose from the soil. One thousand, nay a million voices full of fear. And terror possesed me then. And I begged, \\"Angel of the Lord, what are these tortured screams?\\" And the angel said unto me, \\"These are the cries of the carrots, the cries of the carrots! You see, Reverend Maynard, tomorrow is harvest day and to them it is the holocaust.\\" And I sprang from my slumber drenched in sweat like the tears of one million terrified brothers and roared, \\"Hear me now, I have seen the light! They have a consciousness, they have a life, they have a soul! Damn you! Let the rabbits wear glasses! Save our brothers! Can I get an amen? Can I get a hallelujah? Thank you Jesus.  <br /> <br />Life feeds on life feeds on life feeds on life feeds on........\\" <br /> <br />Not only are their lyrics unique and imaginative, they can also outplay most bands with their amazing rhythm section. Tool's bass and drum combinationis one of the best in the business. The guitars take a backseat in most songs to the amazing rhythms. Never have I heard a band that constantly features bass the way Tool does. I absolutely love it.  <br /> <br />Undertow features a very grungy, dirty feel to it, unlike Lateralus, which feels much more clean. Both albums are amazing, but in different ways. This is by far the more doomy, depressing album of the two, and as such is best listened to when you're in the right mood.  <br /> <br />Another amazing thing about this CD is that it is only Tool's second studio album ever. Many bands will never reach the caliber of this album throughout their whole career, let alone their second album, when they are still working on perfecting a sound. (There are exceptions of course) <br /> <br />If you are interested in getting this album, recommended tracks include Intolerance, Sober, and Prison Sex.  <br /> <br /> Recommended \m/

B0009KA7BS|1.0|Pretty bad and pretty pointless Keanu Reeves vanity project that takes a well respected horror comic book and literally rips apart the complexity of it and makes it a joke with no story and no redeeming value to it. Of all the actors in the film, only Rachel Weisz manages to strike the right note and make you care about what is going on but other than her, you really don't give a damn about any of the characters and really don't give a damn about Keanu's attempt at drama.  <br /> <br />Avoid.  <br />
B0001WDAX6|5.0|Compare this with the new film Donnie Darko. In watching Donnie Darko I was struck by the reverse similarity with \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\". With Jimmy Stewart we have an angel helping him see what his community would have been like without him and this convinces him that it is a wonderful life thus saving him from suicide. With Donnie Darko we have the opposite scenario. Donnie uses quantum physics through the aid of his science teacher and a street wandering centenarian who has written the book on time travel. This enables him to see why everyone will be better off without him and he saves them from himself by using the portal to wipe away his life and the subsequent destruction it causes. The special effects and relationships are certainly different. The family argument at the dinner table is different. But especially different is the moral implication that life for everyone else would be better without Donnie. What a paradigm shift this is. Do our depressed kids need this kind of suggestion? Better that they watch \\"It's a Wonderful Life.\\"
B00080EU58|5.0|Slipknot:the most loved and hated band in the world,depending on who you are.  Am I a maggot? I supose,minus the fanatical devotion.  Do all other bands suck compared to this band? nope.  I guess what makes me different is I have a broad musical palate.  As a brief psuedo review of this cd though, others have said it shows the band growing and maturing, almost as though they are trying to move beyond the \\"teen angst\\" fan quotient, snd there are almost balads on this cd.  Perhaps the side projects have influenced the band,who knows(I'll check them out and edit this review after I do)  The band still packs a nhilistic,misanthropic punch,to be sure,and the bonus disc is a great addition for completists.  buy this,listen to it openly,you may be suprised.    Metal as a musical genre is really changing,I'm old school(80s thrash and black metal mostly) and bands such as Korn,Mudvayne, Slipknot and Mushroomhead,as well as Killswitch Engage have totally revolutionized(some say destroyed) metal.  Metal is a trend again,it's back,angry,and coming for you...you have been warned!

0064471837|5.0|Although I am not a fan of fantasy, a friend gave me this book, she thought I might like it, and within a few weeks I was asking her for Lirael (Part 2) and Abhorsen (Part 3).<br /><br />Garth Nix is an amazing writer, the sotry is such a gripping one you feel the character's fears, sorrows, and joys. The detail is so enriched and vivid you can almost smell and touch the place being described.<br /><br />The story is about Sabriel, a girl trying to search for her father, possibly in danger. You grow with Sabriel througout her first vunerable years till she gets older and stronger and you have to love her by the time you finish the book, if not before.  The excitement and suspense in the book is continous, eased with Nix's humour. The characters are extremely lovable, especially Mogget. I won't ruin the story, but it is such a wonderful read.
B00004RJ74|4.0|From Dusk Till Dawn was an entertaining movie.  It starts off as a simple movie with two brothers trying to get into Mexico to escape feds and meeting a family by chance.  Within an hour, it turns into this all out bloodfest with vampires and bats becoming more of a fantasy movie.  It was a good movie one that doesn't put you to sleep yet one that doesn't mesmorize you either.
0688172377|4.0|First of all, I want to say that this story was amazing, honest and from the heart. Waris explains her journey from her nomadic life in Somalia to London, where she becomes a fashion model.<br /><br />It is so hard to believe that there are places in the world that still exist with no electricity, running water, doctors, pharmacies etc. Waris has shone a light on an area that not many people are aware of, and I congratulate her for that.<br /><br />She has also discussed the issue of FGM, (female genital mutilation) which must have been hard, as she went through it herself. But by doing that, I'm sure that now there are more educated people about this topic, which will help to if not completely, partially wipe this \\"epidemic\\" out of existance.<br /><br />This book was informative and touching to read, and I suggest anyone really to take a look at it, it will open your eyes to another world on our planet. You might also want to read her other book, \\"Desert Dawn\\", which is about her journey back to Somailia to see her parents.
B0000024JN|5.0|Licensed To Ill was one of my very first cassette tapes I ever owned.  I owned this back in Ames, Iowa when I was about 9 or 10 years old.  I remember being very afraid of getting caught listening to this tape because it contained quite a few bad words for its time. <br /> <br />There some absolute classics on this album.  This album launched a very successful career for the B-Boys.  This is a good-times record.  Licensed to Ill is all about fun, and has a great party atmosphere. <br /> <br />Also, it was one of the first albums to blend rock and hip-hop.  Groundbreaking for its time, it still rocks today!
0156012197|5.0|When I was younger, I used to watch the Adventures of the Little Prince. It was a cartoon about a travelling prince. Anyway, I was very happy to find this book later on, as it is the \\"adult version\\". It's basically my life handbook, although not very long, it describes life, in such an enchanting way, you'd never think about. The Little Prince gives a different approach to values, and things we see in our everday life. It's such a fascinating book, that I've kept over the years, and plan to give to my children some day.
630512762X|5.0|Rarely does an action movie manage to rise above its mindless shoot em up execution and offer an indepth character study of both the protagonist and the antagonist that helps us better understand them. John Woo managed to do this with his 1997 movie \\"Face/Off\\", an absurd but well thought out movie that many modern action movies should be modelled after.<br /><br />As I said the plot is absurd. Sean Archer (John Travolta) is a ruthless FBI agent out to capture and, if possible, kill Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage), a homeland terrorist who accidentally killed Archer's young son in a botched assassination attempt. When Archer succeeds in his goal, he thinks it's time to retire and go home to his troubled daughter and his wife (Joan Allen). But, as Pacino would he say, just when he think he's out they pull him back in. It turns out that Troy is still alive and has planted a bomb set to go off at the L.A. Civics Center (at least I think that's where it was). Using new science, Archer and Troy trade faces. Archer, as Troy, will infiltrate a maximum security prison and get the scoop on the bombing from Castor's brother, Pollux. Of course, as expected, Castor emerges from his coma and realizes his face is gone. He forces the surgeons to give him Archer's face and then kills them. He torches all the files that proves who's who. When Troy finds out what happened, he goes ballistic. He stages a daring prison escape and delves deeper into the life of Castor Troy. Troy, meanwhile, has a ball being Archer, sleeping with his wife and getting heaps of praise showered on him as he defuses the bomb he planted. Archer will stop at nothing to get his true identity back and kil Archer before it's too late.<br /><br />As I said, the plot couldn't be more absurd. However, it is very easy to understand. It's more unrealistic than it is absurd. It also does a very good job at examining the pysches of both Archer and Troy. Woo gives us revealing looks at the inner aspects of the two, what makes them tick, why they won't stop until one of them is dead. Most action films are just mindless shootout movies with a few bad catchphrases and weak characters. Woo managed to go beyond this and create one of the most intelligent action movies ever.<br /><br />The film is violent and bloody as hell. However, the violence is very stylized and is not overused, as the violence adds a lot to the tension. \\"Face/Off\\" is a relentlessly entertaining action thriller that I would highly recommend.kes them tick, why they won't stop until one of them is dead.

B0007O38F8|3.0|To be honest, this album was a huge disappointment after 50 dropped 'Get Rich Or Die Tryin'.'  How did we got from \\"In Da Club\\" to \\"Candy Shop?\\"  Come on 50, you let us down with this album.  I wasn't really feeling this album at all except for a few tracks.  The second thing that ran through my mind was, \\"What happened to the production?\\"  He has hot beats on 'Get Rich Or Die Tryin' but the beats on \\"The Massacre\\" weren't that good.  Dr. Dre only produced I think 2, come on 50..when you got Dre you got to use him.  Eminem produced one of my favorite tracks \\"I'm Supposed To Die Tonight.\\"  I loved that beat and 50 drops some nice lyrics and catchy chorus.  50 Cent needs to improve big time on his rhyme scheme, it sounds like he's just droppin' nursery rhymes most of the time.  He gets dusted off his own track by Eminem every time.  The remix to the \\"Hate It Or Love It\\" was hot even though I'm tired of them remixing that song.  The Dr. Dre produced \\"Outta Control\\" was a hot track.  Another hot track is \\"Get In My Car.\\"  Probably the most catchy chorus on the whole album.  I also enjoyed \\"Gunz Come Out\\" track. <br /> <br />I would only suggest this album to true Shady/Aftermath fans.  Because I'm a fan of that label and I wasn't feeling this album much at all.  Now 50 Cent really needs to come back with something fire or 50 is going to start losing fans..including me.

Even Flow sounds like some idiot in his bedroom trying to be Hendrix with Mr. Garbage Mouth himself (that's right Eddie Cheddar!) throwing on his \\"timeless\\" mouthings about sucking (...)for crack in San Diego. Then you have Alive. Normally I'd like a song about a guy banging his mom, but sorry Eduardo! Not happening! Dumb, dumb, dumb. Why Go is another stupid song. Seriously. Then you have Black. My lord, what a crappy song. Could they try any harder to  be INXS? I think not. Jeremy killed himself in class today! Awesome! Too bad he didn't kill Eduardo Veduardo instead! Now don't forget the other five songs. One, two, three, four, five against THEY ALL SUCK! BAD, BAD, BAD! THIS IS SUCH A CRAPPY ALBUM! IT MAKES  NEVERMIND SEEM GOOD! DON'T BUY IT!

7119005901|5.0|The Three Kingdoms is set right at the end of the Han dynasty and covers more than a century when the unity of China was broken.  Moss Roberts has done a good job translating this vigorous history of alliances, betrayals, bravery, cowardace, and greed.  It isn't exactly a historical novel as there are many supernatural elements, but you do get a good feeling of what life was like in those turbulent times. <br /> <br />He cleverly puts the analytical essay at the end, since most of us wouldn't appreciate it if it had been at the beginning.
B0000060AK|5.0|This is a historic recording in every respect.  <br />Before this recording many people thought that Hndel operas were all the same and mostly un-dramatic. Minkowski definitely changed this with an extremely dramatic recording. Never before we heard these extreme emotions and tempos in a Hndel opera. In 1998, when the recording appeared, there were mixed reactions. <br />Gramophone preferred the McGegan, because Minkowski was 'over the top', but on the European continent most reviewers recognized the importance and were baffled: the French magazine 'Diapason' even attributed a 'Diapason du sicle', this means that for them this was a recording of the century. <br />Even now, some people still prefer the McGegan which I can not understand. Just compare the beginning of the ouverture, and you hear that Minkowski enters the drama, he gets into the music. With McGegan it's just another lovely tune in the gallant Baroque style, but this is an opera=drama! In the second part of the ouverture Minkowski has 'drive', McGegan's version already falls flat. I won't go futher into McGegan's singers, which are honorable, but can't excel in the sort of routine direction he offers. Let's concentrate on Minkowski's cast: Lynne Dawson is a definitive Ginevra. Even Gramophone said she was 'the Hndel soprano of this moment' and indeed: what a beautiful voice, what technical assurance! Listen to the first act 'volate amori', and you understand what they mean by a Hndel prima donna. Ecstasy in every note, the bride is extremely happy at that point, not aware of what is ahead of her. <br />I am normally not a big fan of Von Otter, but here she is perfectly in place. Every line she sings is heartfelt and meant. On top of that you get the bravoura e.g. in the third act 'Dopo notte', which is really liberating after all the dramatic events that preceded. <br />The emotional climax of this recording is 'Scherza infida' where the music almost comes to a stand-still. It's really revolutionary to go to these extremes of tempo and dynamics and it is breath-taking. <br />Ewa Podles is a wicked Polinesso, no pleasant voice but very convincing. And the range of her voice is simply unbelievable, listen to 'Dover, giustizia, amor' in the 3rd act and marvel. Denis Sedov was very young at the time of the recording, but what a noble king! He has the greatest entrance : he interrups the da capo of the Ginevra-Ariodante duet 'prendi da questa mano' with a great line 'Non vi turbato, bell'alma innamorate' which can not sound more lovingly parental. Veronica Cangemi and Richard Croft conclude the cast of first-rate singers and the fact alone that they can keep up with Minkowski's extreme tempos is admirable.  <br />I own over 50 Hndel opera and oratorium recordings, and this is definitively one of my favorites (others are Nelson's Semele, Christie's Orlando and Hickox' Alcina). It is certainly the one I admire most, because everything is right. <br />But you must see a Hndel opera as drama, and not just a chain of beautiful tunes ... <br />
0767834739|1.0|I could not believe how bad this movie was!  Paul Anderson made AvP a bad movie, but I didn't know he could possibly write something this bad.  He even goes as far as stealing the \\"We are assets, expendable assets\\" line from Predator and \\"Newt, I like that\\" line from Aliens (although it's \\"Angie, I like that\\").  There is no reason for the audience to care about any of the characters as there is only one returning from the original movie and the rest are just thrown in for thrills.  Jill Valentine's inclusion is absurd and pointless as the first movie had nothing to do with the characters from the games, so why include them in the sequel?  Alice from the first movie is equally two-dimensional as she has suffered a complete pointless personality change.  She protested killing people after they were bitten in the first movie, but the first thing she does when that happens to someone in this is point a gun at them and prepare to fire.  Yeah, I know it's terrible.  This is the most illogical movie of all time.  Why would Alice drive her motorcycle through the stain-glass window of a church instead of walking through the door, and how did she even know how to get in there?  Why didn't Alice simply kick the villain's butt when he said \\"Fight him\\" and she said \\"no\\".  Moments earlier she had killed several guards with relative ease, but now she couldn't do it?  I don't think so.  I cannot believe that this story was bought and actually green-lit to be made into a feature film.  That's the most ridiculous thing of all time and after Ghosts of Mars and this movie Screen Gems' credibility has just fallen to rock bottom.  No wonder Paul Anderson didn't direct this, he must have known that it was one of the worst films of 2004 before it was even made.
B000002J2B|5.0|Wind & Wuthering(1976) was the last album with Steve Hackett and the last truly good album of Genesis. An amazing line up of songs are featured on here. The album starts out with ELEVNTH EARL OF MAR which goes back to their roots of prog-rock. ONE FOR THE VINE is probably the worst song on here as it is very long and extremly tedious. YOUR OWN SPECIAL way is the start of all the ballads the band will play later on. WOT GORILLA? is a funny musical jam and I enjoyed the humor of ALL IN A MOUSE'S NIGHT. Next comes my favourite song BLOOD ON THE ROOFTOPS, which has a lovely classical nylon-string intro. UNQUIET SLUMBER FOR THE SLEEPERS IN THAT QUIET EARTH is the big instrumental epic of the album. And finally the beautiful AFTERGLOW ends the album on a high note.
B00005JL3A|3.0|My biggest annoyance with this movie is the fact that it has almost nothing to do with the original video game.  The other thing that annoys me is the fact that 2/3 of the characters are killed in about 5 minutes and we don't even get to really know half of them.  Other than that the visual style, special effects, and story of the movie all add together to produce an entertaining sci-fi horror movie that will hopefully not cause an outrage amongst die hard fans of the video games.  This isn't meant to be a re-make of the first game, but it does use some similar elements and some completely knew ones.  If you enjoy Paul Anderson's other works such as Soldier, Event Horizon, and/or AvP, you'll probably like this.  If you only go for Spielberg type movies than stay away from this at all costs.
B00004U2GH|5.0|Relive this cd as if you were there. Just close your eyes and feel the electricty in the air it makes the hair on the back of your neck to stand on end. pure magic with Cash like you have never heard him before. Brilliant
B000067DNC|4.0|This season has it all. Every single member of Stargate gets plenty of air time and we get to see some new allies come into existense.
B0000DD7UC|5.0|My favorite song on this CD is Try To Hard. This is a must buy!
B00005QG9J|5.0|When I listened to this album, I was transported to a time before dinosaurs, when ROCK ruled the Earth. The electronic synthezisers enraptured me, and the flutes made sweet love to my ears. The guitar tortured me sublime, then killed me with cruelty, then brought me back to life like Lazarus. Truly the greatest album of ROCK that has ever been made by human hand.
B0000028VT|4.0|My favorite song on here is, I've Been Thinking About You. This is a must buy!
B0007GAEGC|5.0|This CD is such a joy to listen to.  Voices are so pure and sincere...Lovely selection of songs and done extremely well. I think if you are looking for something wonderful and  relaxing  this is it!!! I'm glad I purchased it!
B00005OM4N|5.0|The only song I don't like is, I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman.
0790729628|5.0|I'll stand in line to be the millionth to review Blade Runner. I love both the first release with the voiceovers & also the Director's Cut - there were two ways to skin the cat (Blade Runner test image). Blade Runner is a brain wave opera that walks the tightrope on love & anger,good & evil,male & female,beauty & grotesque. The cast was all wonderful - especially Sean Young as Rachael, who walks the tightrope on human & perfection.  The Vangelis soundtrack including the beautiful \\"Blade Runner Blues\\" is now available through Amazon.
B0007Y4USW|5.0|This is one of my favorites by her! Every song is amazing! This is a must buy! Take It To the Floor with Nelly is my favorite on this CD.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly was a great series that never really got a chance on TV, for reasons that have been widely publicized. Although I watched each episode when it was on TV, I couldn't wait for the DVDs to be released. This is actually my second set, which I am now going to pass out to family and friends so everyone can see them before Serenity (the movie based on the Firefly series) is released on September 30th.  <br /> <br />The series is smart, funny, and has a great cast of characters.
B000066NW0|4.0|This CD is great. My favorite song on it is, Losing Grip. The only songs I don't like on it is, Sk8er Boi and I'm With You.
B000A2RRF4|4.0|In his prime MJ was at the top of his game and easily one of the best entertainers around. This concert at Bucherst is a timecapsule of the genius that once was. There were only a handful that were on his level (Think Janet,Madonna, & Prince) This was an incredible show and the energy was off the charts. His dancing ...spot on. Hit after hit...the concert could have been a bit longer....but then again look at his extensive catalog of songs to choose from he could have been on stage playing all night. If you like his music and you havent (or have) not gotten the chance to see him live than this is a must have. It may infact be the only chance (unless other concerts are released) to do so. My Oh my how times have changed the music of lately really s**ks (think AMERICAN IDIOT er i mean idol???) and im not even going to go into the circus that has happened over the past decade but was it media over kill...hateful exemployees doing kiss n tells or (gasp!!!make that double gasp!) could have some of his own actions that has brought this all about...on to him self????? Indeed he may have trusted the wrong people but there is a thing called common sence and the man does have a great intellect other wise the wonderful music he ceated would have never existed....Ok i cant resist one shot What in the blue heck was he thinking dangiling a baby out a window any way???? Ok i vented...now back to the music..and there is plenty of it and for that we are fortunate indeed. But the events of late and all the sorrow may have taken a huge toll on MJ physically and emotionally and one wonders if (and when) he will ever regain the magic that made him one of the worlds most endering entertainers..In that answer im not that optomistic and i wouldnt blame him a bit either. He who has always had a big heart has been more than taken advantage of and regardless of weather or not the charges were true or not and yes he was found NOT GUILTY how could he want to open up and share his world with anyone again. I think if he wants to start the healing he needs to go out on tour and soon if not solo have  a reunion tour with the entire family in concert (and yes include Janet as well). He needs to connect with his fans and stop letting the media making him and his life in to a freak show. Its not right. He needs to (pardon the pun)take Control (sorry janet.)and get his life back in order and as i said on of the best ways of doing that is getting out there and connecting with the fans. But if and when he will (or if ever) we at least will have the treasure trove of great music and finally now a complete MICHAEL JACKSON Concert and these are timeless. Heal the world indeed...but, my how far we all have (and MJ) fallen since then....But none the less sit back  at the only full legnth Michael Jackson ever released- It is a blast and will bring some of that magic back if only for a few moments....
B000002AVF|5.0|This is a must buy! My favorite song on it is, Always Be My Baby.
B000002KNY|5.0|It seems EVERYONE feels Remain In Light is Talking Heads' best album, but I think this one trumps em all. <br /> <br />The songs are poppy, short, unique, and funky. <br /> <br />It's a really great listen throughout, more so than Remain In Light (which I feel tapers off in quality at the end). This album has great songwriting throughout. <br /> <br />Off the top of my head, here are my favorite tracks: <br />Mind, Cities, Heaven, Animals (real funky ending), Electric Guitar... though all tracks are noteworthy in their own right. <br /> <br />I'm relatively young (21) and just recently got the Talking Heads fever. If older music like this can still sound fresh to me (the album came out before I was born), it should say something about the albums ability to withstand the test of time. The Talking Heads have a real unique sound that no one has come close to matching. <br /> <br />Bottom Line:: Top notch band puts out their best album. Buy it!
B000002BQK|4.0|My favorite song on it is, The Roof. This is a must buy!
B000002G7G|5.0|Most everyone has seen Velvet Underground and Nico on various greatest album lists... but in my opinion the others are just as fine as that stellar album. This one is no exception. Real top-notch song writing here. <br /> <br />My favorite songs are the more mellow ones: Candy Says, Some Kinda Love, Pale Blue Eyes, That's the Story of My Life. <br /> <br />Everyone says What Goes On is a classic, but the solo is annoyingly loud to me... just a personal gripe. <br /> <br />Other than that very very minor complaint, this album is top notch like all other Velvet Underground offerings. <br /> <br />Go purchase it! You won't regret it.
B00004RHZU|4.0|Not one of my favorites but worth it to keep. I like Pinks music.
B00000099Y|5.0|So, fifteen years from now, some of us will be raising teenagers who may be like us, who scour our parents record collections looking for something heady or trippy like I did when I wore out my dad's 'Dark Side of the Moon', 'Led Zeppelin II', and 'the Crazy World of Arthur Brown'.  <br /> <br />I would love to say that Tool is an original band with no influences. But I know that to be incorrect. Tool has been inspired by many of the bands I listened through during that period in high school where i learned about what my parents experienced during the sixties. Disagree? Go see them live. I do not mean this as an insult. Tool has assumed the position as the premiere thinking man's rock and roll band (well, actually, they split that title with Radiohead). Splitting titles aside, I've got a feeling my kids will be listening to my Tool albums over my Radiohead allbums in the year 2020. <br /> <br /> I think they are the most talented band recording music today, but I am biased. BUT - I want to know where Tool will place in the annals of rock. They will easily assume the position that Black Sabbath holds in twenty years. I love Metallica, but they're sort of the metal Lynyrd Skynyrd - wonderful rythyms, no psychedelia. I believe Tool will hold multiple classic rock parallels. They are both the Pink Floyd, the Black Sabbath of our generation, and I hope to see kids wearing their t-shirts for decades to come. <br /> <br />Now, onto how I rate the album in the discography of Tool. This is my SECOND favorite album, behind Lateralus. Both albums are drenched in creativity, but to me, the sole weak track on this album is worse than the weak track on Lateralus. 'Ticks and Leeches' is better than 'Jimmy'. And the other deciding factor - the trilogy that ends Lateralus is f-ing phenomenal. Not that this album doesn't merit attention. This album trumps the previous work of Paul D'amour with Justin Chancellor, awesome packaging, wonderful arrangements, and to me - the firdt full-oncombination of heavy music and philosophy. We've got the ingenious theories of Terrence McKenna, Bill Hicks, and Timothy Leary taking on the questionable teachings of MTV and L. Ron Hubbard. Need I say more?
B0001UL7RY|4.0|Great CD. I give it 4 stars because I got sick of a couple that played too much on the radio.
0671027387|2.0|This book was a letdown compared  to Angels and Demons and the Da Vinci Code.  The characters weren't fleshed out and the<br /><br />plot was ridiculous. Borrow this book, don't buy it!
B00005RFAI|4.0|I give this 4 stars because there is some songs on here I don't like. Otherwise, this CD is worth it to keep forever!
0440133688|2.0|As a second year medical student, I had been told by many people that this was the book to read. However, I found the book too cynical and unrealistic. It was melodramatic at times as well, though it did make me laugh occasionally. I really just didn't care for the overall tone of the book.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I recommend it. My favorite song on it is, The Hook Up. Touch of My Hand I ignore and I hate Toxic. Other than that its a great CD. I also don't like the remix. But, some people might.
0553565915|5.0|With the death of my Grandmother in September 1993 I didn't think that I would be able to go on without this wonderful person.  While watching a TV progam, her book was topic.  I had just had a baby and was caught up in the process of motherhood and dealing with the passing of my grandmothers death.  I went out to buy the book and read it in nearly one day.  Now 13 years later, I was able to meet the lady \\"Betty J. Eadie\\" here in Sacramento at a talking engagment. For anyone who is in question on life in the after life, this book is a MUST read.
B00005Y228|4.0|Not one of my favorites of hers, but worth it to buy. My favorite song on this CD is, Dancefloor.
B00000IL29|5.0|Herbie Hancock's Maiden Voyage remains a classic in the jazz genre. At the time of its release, he was also playing with the Miles Davis Quintet and the maturity he gained in working with them is in full evidence here. Its legend is such that two tracks, the title song and \\"Dolphin Dance\\", still receive generous airplay on jazz radio. The album begins with the aforementioned title track, one of the best and most recognizable songs in the genre. Hancock's simple yet melodic piano line provides the mood for excellent solos from both trumpeter Freddie Hubbard and saxophonist George Coleman. Despite its mellow theme, drummer Tony Williams, then only 19, is creative throughout, sometimes throwing in loud quick fills, while other times playing very understated. Yet, it's still Herbie's show here as his solo is truly a thing of beauty. \\"The Eye Of The Hurricane\\" is a great hard bop tune featuring very busy playing from bassist Ron Carter and stellar interplay between Herbie and both Coleman and Hubbard. \\"Little One\\" is a very somber piece that features a cool solo from Carter along with Herbie's quiet and reserved playing. The band's performance of this track, which Herbie would also record that year with Miles on the E.S.P. album, matches its solemn mood perfectly. \\"Survival Of The Fittest\\" is most dramatic song here as it moves from hard bop in its first half to a showcase for Herbie's lightning fast runs, while also spotlighting Tony Williams, who has no less than three solos in the track alone. Finally, \\"Dolphin Dance\\" is a mellow ballad, featuring a memorable horn line as well as great solos from both Hubbard and Coleman. A classic in the genre and arguably his best album, Maiden Voyage established Herbie Hancock as one of the premier composers in jazz. Highly recommended.
B00004SCX6|5.0|I love this album so far the best. My favorite song on it is, One Kiss From You. I strongly recommend it for Britney fans like me. Or just for people who are thinking about buying it.
1400032717|5.0|I couldn't put this book down!  His writing is hysterical and easy to read - similar to novels by David Sedaris.  And as the added bonus, I gained much insight into the life of an autistic - something I really knew nothing about.  This is definitely a must read.
B000002UAR|5.0|I'll agree with the majority that this is one of the best rock albums ever, but I think the Beatles, as impressive, pivotal and crucial as REVOLVER is, continued to progress and create even better music - something truly astonishing. I think each of their subsequent albums tops this one except for the YELLOW SUBMARINE Soundtrack and LET IT BE (and possibly/maybe MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR due to a few less-than-stellar tracks not to mention the odd original format - see my rather unusual review on that one, if you so choose). There are a few reasons in particular why I feel this way - allow me to explain (and, although I am a fan, I'll try to skip the Beatles trivia and just go straight to my personal opinions of REVOLVER):<br /><br />\\"Taxman\\" - Jagged, super-catchy Harrison tune. I need not point out how great each of these four musicians are as they are certainly among the most talented the world has ever seen -  but I really dig the bass line on this one. The \\"Taxman\\" gets a well deserved drubbing, to humorous effect. *****<br /><br />\\"Eleanor Rigby\\" - Paul, yer breakin' me bleedin' heart! This song KILLS me every single time. *****+<br /><br />\\"I'm Only Sleeping\\" - lackadaisical yet excellent song. Lennon perfectly captures a certain mood he no doubt experienced fairly often. ****1/2<br /><br />\\"Love To You\\" - I think this is one of George's best-ever East-Indian flavored songs. ****1/2<br /><br />\\"Here, There and Everywhere\\" - Quite simply, one of the most beautiful ballads ever created. Has a very warm, old-fashioned feel to it, something the song's writer, Paul, had a particular affinity for. Glowing harmonies, simple yet perfect. *****+<br /><br />\\"Yellow Submarine\\" - so fun it's addictive - almost dangerously so. Great sound effects too - it's obvious they had a blast recording this one. ****1/2<br /><br />\\"She Said, She Said\\" - I guess just about everyone already knows this was inspired by an acid trip Lennon had with Peter Fonda (his second? - OK, enough trivia). A spiraling, engrossing melody from one of rock's greatest voices (and one of the greatest talents ever whether or not he'd've admitted it). *****<br /><br />\\"Good Day Sunshine\\" - McCartney heaven. *****<br /><br />\\"And Your Bird Can Sing\\" - yes, the guitar work is phenomenal (at least according to many notable guitarists in their own right . . .), but this is one of the few Beatles songs I really don't care for. I just think the lyrics in particular are rather annoying. I admit, I've never been turned on much by the British slang which refers to women as \\"birds.\\" Lennon himself said he didn't think much of this tune, claiming it was basically filler. Then again, he said that about a lot of fantastic Beatles tunes as well (especially during a strange phase he was going through after the Beatles broke up I might add . . .). I'm sorry, I just think this one is rather lame and I typically skip it. **1/2<br /><br />\\"For No One\\" - a deep, deeply sad track. This song sounds very mature, far removed from the \\"She Loves You\\" days just a few years before. Alan Civil, who played with the Philharmonic, contributed French Horn. According to him, the song \\"had been recorded in rather bad musical style, in that it was 'in the cracks', neither B-flat nor B-major . . .\\" Apparently he found it to be a difficult session, but the horn solo is such a great touch to an already wonderful track. *****+<br /><br />\\"Doctor Robert\\" - a song about a notorious doctor known for dealing psychedelics, this is far from my favorite Lennon tune. McCartney clearly makes the strongest overall showing on REVOLVER (while the previous album, RUBBER SOUL, can be seen as more of a Lennon showcase). ***1/4<br /><br />\\"I Want To Tell You\\" - one of my favorite Harrison songs, and I should point out that George makes a very strong showing on REVOLVER as well. This song captures that feeling of \\"butterflies\\" in the stomach most of us get when we're nervous and young, talking to the opposite sex ( . . . or the same sex for that matter). *****<br /><br />\\"Got To Get You Into My Life\\" - a brilliant, super-upbeat McCartney track, and the bits he wrote for the horn section really make this one shine. *****<br /><br />\\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" - the great leap forward. Otherworldly tape loops, drums miked in ways never previously attempted, vocals processed through a revolving Leslie speaker from a Hammond organ . . . this track is a mind-blower.  I would even say that this is the most psychedelic song the Beatles ever created. Absolutely transcendental. *****+<br /><br />So you see, I don't consider this to be a masterpiece through and through, but it's still got to be one of the best albums ever made. You couldn't reproduce what the Beatles did on this album with all the modern technological gadgetry in the world. If only one band from the past century is to be remembered for centuries and centuries to come, that band undoubtedly would be the Beatles.McCartney track, and the bits he wrote for the horn section really make this one shine. *****    \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" - the great leap forward.

B0007P3582|1.0|U want Candy Shop? I AM the Candy shop! This album sucks. I mean, I know rap is horrible anyway, but does 50 cent really have to add another horrible album to his collection?? You want REAL music, get yerself some Alice In Chains.
B0007O38F8|1.0|Because of the whole rap industry that has been overruled by MTV, 50 Cent is a piece of human garbage and the fact that society glamorizes this kind of music and rewards such low lifes is absolutely appalling. He's a former drug dealer, a former street hustler, and a former gang member with the Bloods and should be wearing an orange jump suite and picking up trash on the side of the road as opposed to being a huge superstar. He has no grasp of the English language and like most rappers, has absolutely no musical talent. Rap is only popular because it panders to people whose intelligence level is of the lowest common denominator and many youths get brainwashed by this music because of MTV. Unlike real musicians who play their own instruments and have actually read a book in their lifetime, rappers like 50 Cent just get on the mic and start spouting off a bunch of Ebonics and white kids eat it up. The same stupid white kids who would get robbed, car jacked and beaten within an inch of their life if they ever rolled thru 50's \\"hood\\" after dark. They say every fad eventually comes to an end (i.e. Disco, Hair Metal, Grunge, Alternative, etc.) and that being true, I will be so glad when this Hip Hop craze bites the dust like many of its \\"artists\\" normally do. I mean, what happened to being a musician? To actually \\"playing an instrument\\" and \\"creating\\" your own music?\\" I don't think a bunch of former gang members, drug dealers, and street criminals prancing around on stage dressed like they're about to parachute out of an airplane while hooting and hollering saying \\"what, what, what, what...\\" over and over and over again counts as music. There is something wrong with our society when success lies in being a street criminal turned rapper and not through hard work, education, and being a decent member of the human race. <br /> <br />Rap is like any other genre; 95% of it is crap. Judging rap by, say, this song, is like judging rock and roll by watching MTV and claiming whatthey show represents the whole. Rap has a quality control issue largely because there are a lot of people who feel they still have to defend it as a genre, and so are less than willing (except when talking among themselves) to condemn cruddy hip hop, for fear that they're somehow giving comfort to their critics. Rap at its best is about \\"skills.\\" Having heard groups like Eric B and Rakim (on tracks like \\"Follow the Leader,\\") Run DMC (Peter Piper), Pete Rock and CL Smooth (Mecca and the Soul Brother), Public Enemy (\\"By the Time I Get to Arizona\\"), and even lesser known groups like Group Home (Livin' Proof), I find it hard to give any credit at all to guys like 50 Cent who just do not impress me. And it is pretty amazing the way complete moral degenerates have become heroes in the rap world. I'm hardly an expert on hip hop, but to me the idea of hip hop was, you have these underpriviliged kids living in urban squalor, a place which a lot of white folks considered \\"cultureless.\\" No money for textbooks, not to mention musical programs...but wait, dad's got an old turntable he doesn't use...And maybe I can't sing but I have a story to tell, and I can tell it in a rhythm most drummers couldn't even drum. Rhyming, DJing, graffiti, and breakdancing - the sum of the parts greater than the whole...Now it is true that *anyone* can rap; at least anyone with working vocal chords. The issue is that not everyone can rap *well* and the best MCs really are talented, even though, if you've been raised on the Top 40 garbage of the last 10 years, you might not understand this. One would think that if you lived in a crime-ridden ghetto you'd be appalled by the violence, drug addiction, and all of the other plagues of inner city life, and you'd want to build a scene, a united front against all of this. I don't see how much of what is played on the radio or television contributes anything positive. Moral bankruptcy seems to be the baseline these days as does constant, never-ending bragging about sexual escapades, tossing money in slow motion to the camera, outright sexism, and in some cases glorification of a violent, criminal lifestyle. Worse yet, so many of the people who slog this garbage and call it art never want to take responsibility for what they say or do. They can advocate any kind of degeneracy, and when challenged, fall back on the cop-out that they're \\"just reporting life, like it is.\\" You know what that is? That's being bodgy-made. That's all it is. And the vast majority of people who want to say whatever they want, however they want, and dodge responsibility when people can't tell if they're advocating something, reporting on something they saw, or mere high-school braggadocio, are indeed, just a bunch of lame, low-life punks. And if you are honest about advocating selling drugs (and wrecking lives), shooting people, whatever, to me you're just a criminal, and any idiot can be a criminal. It is not ennobling. The rap world needs to start recognizing quality and talent when it comes around and through what they lay their money down for in record stores, start encouraging talent rather than pimping out anything that comes along that calls itself hip-hop. Hint: Any group that constantly references \\"getting paid\\" probably isn't it, as any long time rock fan would point out. It's not about being a Big Money Hustla, it's about skilled rhymes and dropping science and tearing crap up on a turntable, and at least sometimes, having something worthwhile to say. Morever, it's about not being a *POSER*, which so much of the rap world is, in its pretense to being some kind of gangsta. 50 Cent may well be one, but the fact that people tend to be endlessly fascinated by this, and give him *credit* for being a degenerate criminal, is one primary reason why heavy criticism will always dog rap, and why so much of the criticism of mainstream rap is completely deserved. Also threatening each other with violence constantly tends to make people consider rapa sick joke. That should probably stop too. When the gangsta fetishists realize that any idiot - and I do mean *any* idiot - can take up a gun and shoot someone, or sell drugs, maybe things will improve. The greatest enemies of hip hop right now are undiscerning hip hop fans and the phonies and degenerates whose records they buy. There is room for disagreements on matters of taste, but at best, In Da Club is disposable pap - rap's answer to Britney Spears. And if you don't see that, where is white supremacy when you need it?
1573223026|5.0|In Nick Hornby's latest novel, four Londoners (including one American) have an unlikely meeting:  on New Year's Eve, they all wind up at the top of a popular London high-rise with the intention of coming down the fast way.  Through a series of rather quirky circumstances, however, they agree to take the stairs back down together.  Over the next weeks and months, they find themselves spending more and more time with each other despite the fact that they have virtually nothing in common--other than being suicidal that is, which turns out to be key.<br /><br />I've read all of Hornby's previous novels and particularly enjoyed [[ASIN:1573227331 About a Boy]]. Given both that Hornby again decided to tackle the subject of suicide combined and the fact that I'm a psychologist, I was eager to read this new book.  Happily, Hornby did not disappoint, and I found myself frequently laughing out loud, a rarity for me.  Despite this, however, in no way does Hornby mock or diminish the seriousness of suicide; rather, the use of humor serves more to highlight the despair that someone in that position might feel.  The novel is written in the varying voices of the four main characters, and I found each of them to ring true.  Finally, although there is no simple \\"happy\\" ending, like the book itself, the conclusion is quite real.  I hope Hornby continues to write about serious topics, as ironically, I found his two more serious novels (this one and [[ASIN:1573227331 About a Boy]]) much funnier than his two lighter-hearted ones ([[ASIN:1573225517 High Fidelity]] and [[ASIN:1573229326 How to Be Good]]).

B0007QJ1MK|5.0|Three years after the breakthrough success of \\"Songs for the Deaf\\", Queens of the Stone Age return with \\"Lullabies to Paralyze\\"; which as it's predecessor, is a surprisingly addictive rock record that must be heard to be believed.  Bassist Nick Oliveri is gone, but fear not, for Josh Homme has assembled an album full of the trippy, sludgy riffs and tempos that have become a staple of the band.  Lead single \\"Little Sister\\" is catchy as can be, while \\"I Never Came\\" is a gutsy rocking rant.  \\"Medication\\" and \\"In My Head\\" are standouts as well, while guest spots by ZZ Top's Billy Gibbons (on \\"Burn the Witch\\") and Garbage singer Shirley Manson (on \\"You've Got a Killer Scene There, Man\\") are amazingly fitting.  Don't listen to the naysayers who are panning this album, \\"Lullabies to Paralyze\\" is the best mainstream rock record you'll hear all year, and if you fell in love with \\"Songs for the Deaf\\" in 2002, prepare to fall in love all over again.
0226039331|5.0|This lexicon is invaluable for doing Greek word studies.<br /><br />As a layman struggling to teach myself Greek, I find it a great place from which to launch my Greek word studies.  It contains more than 15,000 references to classical, intertestamental, early Christian and modern literature.<br /><br />This edition contains more elaborate definitions of Greek terms than other lexicons I have seen.  The benefit of these, to me, is that it helps give me a fuller sense of the word being studied and helps me to avoid anachronisms.<br /><br />There is no doubt in my mind that this is the lexicon for serious Greek students.
B00063EMJ6|5.0|While any compilation of greatest hits will, by definition, omit songs that one believes should be included, I think this collection is first rate.  I agree with the reviewer who would have liked to hear some of Young's Buffalo Springfield songs, many of which are as good, if not better, than the songs contained here.  However, I have heard other Neil Young greatest hits sets, and none of them compares favorably to this album, in terms of selection and sound quality.  Young is one of the few rock musicians who seems to take great pains to ensure clear and well-imaged recordings.  All of these songs have been digitally remastered, and for those of you whose CD players recognize HDCD recordings, this album is an excellent example of the stellar results that are obtained using HDCD production.  As for Young's songs, they are timeless; listen to k.d. lang's \\"Hymns of the 49th Parallel,\\" which contains \\"After the Gold Rush\\" and \\"Helpless\\" for proof of how well his songs endure.
0345448898|5.0|I remember first seeing the title \\"His Dark Materials\\" on a boxed set at a wal-mart and thinking it was sort of odd. It struck me at once that it must be referring to God, (or some cosmic force) for who else could be referred to in such a vague fashion, the lone pronoun. The point that sealed my fate as for the reading of these books was the implication of God posessing something dark, seemingly quite a stark contradiction. My interest was piqued. I let the title nag at the edge of my mind for a few weeks before I actually picked up a copy. I wasn't dissapointed. The feeling I was left with after finishing the series was that I had truly stumbled upon a treasure, and in retrospect I found it hard to believe anyone could just walk into a local wal-mart and get a copy of their own.  <br />To sum it up: A masterpiece by Pullman.

0553382179|4.0|The author borrows liberally from people who pioneered organizational systems -- at least, unlike many others, FlyLady openly admits where she got her ideas and inspirations. It is always refreshing to read a self-help author with a conscience. I am subtracting one star, because as helpful as this book is to people like myself, who run flat out into the wall of their own perfectionism, all the references to 'God' are annoying, distracting and, as far as I can tell, yet another bit of Christian propaganda in a society that is already swarming with Christians and New Agers. This unsavory bit of smarm has actually caused me to *dislike* an otherwise good book. 'God breezes', thanking God. WHOSE God, might I ask? Enough, already.

B000002NFM|4.0|My first Prodigy CD was Always Outnumbered, Never Outgunned (it was my first electronic music CD ever). I -kind- of liked it... at least some of the songs (Girls, Get Up Get Off, Medusa's Path). I thought reviewers were a bit too harsh with AONO when comparing with Fat of The Land... until I bought it. I can't say that FOTL is a masterpiece--I doubt that it is. But the compositions in FOTL are way better imho. With AONO, I found myself trying to like it. I didn't need that with FOTL (though some songs can be mediocre, esp. Diesel Power). Maybe AONO tries too hard to be electronic.
0060512806|4.0|This is a sprawling novel with 3 different stories going on at once. 2 of them take place during WWII and the third in the modern era. Each story deals with encrypted messages. In WWII it's the men trying to break the German and Japanese coded messages and in the modern era it's the hackers trying to encrypt their emails and such so no one knows their business. The book jumps back and forth between the three with no warning and eventually the two WWII storylines cross over and intermix. Many of the characters in the modern story are relatives of the WWII people so in some ways their story intermixes as well. With all this, the plot is actually pretty thin, but Stephenson somehow keeps you interested in seeing what happens next. There is so much here that didn't need to be. At 1150 pages it was in desperate need of an editor and the ending is a big letdown. However, it kept my interest and there were times when I had trouble putting it down.
B0000640SB|5.0|A hilarous and campy film that hits the spot on orginality.  Will Smith continues his comedic acting as the young hotshot rookie. And Tommy Lee Jones does a great job as the overbearing yet lovable experience \\"MIB\\" character.  Both actors bring life and vitality to the movie and characters they play.  A film that brings a great sense of comedic punch lines and humorous slapstick.  A great for the whole family to watch.
0895260131|5.0|Spencer has become my favorite writer on Islam. Prior to Spencer I had only read Seyyed Hossein Nasr, a Muslim. They both agree that Islam differs from Christianity in that the political component is integral to Islam and optional in Christianity. <br />Spencer raises some excellent points about the implications of allowing sharia courts in Canada and Europe (a movement that many Muslim women oppose as it puts them at the mercy of the same type of life they escaped in other lands), and about the West's peculiar embarrassment about its own achievements. <br />Whether you support or oppose the war in Iraq this book is required reading for understanding the worldwide friction between Muslims and their non-Muslim neighbors.  <br />(By the way, it is reasonably easy to tell which negative reviewers have read the book and which have not as Spencer actually has a number of positive things to say about Islam.) <br />
B00000FCBC|4.0|I myself am a fan from the \\"Kill them All\\" - \\"And justice for All\\" era.  However I found this to be a good listen.   <br /> <br />Here's why:  <br /> <br />I know people say there just covers, but keep in mind that Garage Days Re-Revisited were covers as well.  Disc 1 was more like Ballads and \\"metal.\\"  \\"Whiskey in the Jar\\" is a FAR better Thin Lizzy tune then when Metallica tore it to peices. <br /> <br />  I admit I really didn't like the new list of covers (minus the Sabra Cadabra tune), but Disc 2 is where it all makes up for the first disk.  It's a great compilation of their past covers from Garage Days Revisited and Re-revisited.  Not to mention it has the \\"Prince\\", \\"Bread Fan\\", and more great tracks.  The covers they did on disc 2 were METAL and not \\"metal\\".   <br /> <br />In my opinion, it's worth the purchase because they were smart to include their past cover works.  Unless you already have their older covers, this is a good opportunity to buy their early works on one CD. If it was just the set of covers that they did on Disc 1,  I wouldn't have bought the CD.

I have to sit hours because I wanted to write a really positive review of it after getting sick of the negative reviews but I can not bring myself to like it. It is a sadistic attack on the patience of the ordinary viewer.

B000068OCS|5.0|Looking at previous reviews, I thought it appropriate to mention the comments on the film being \\"dated\\".  Well, it is.  So is Casablanca.  In fact, so is that milk you have in your fridge.  What's important is the chord the film strikes in you (if any), and whether that message transcends time.  I believe that it still does.  Oddly enough, as our cultures and styles are ever-changing, the items that people tend to think date this film now appear to be more fashionable again. <br /> <br />The simplest review that I can offer to you is to simply watch this film.  Even if, having sat part-way through it, the images have not provoked thought, at least watch the film to its end. Then, reflect back on it as a whole, and how it built action and tension as it meandered through our existence.  Like all things in life, not everybody will like this film; but again, like all things in life, do not judge until you have given it a fair chance.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|Take a moment and try and imagine the history of music without Johnny Cash. If you imagined a big black hole, you got it pretty much right. Although alot of people may not realize it, Johnny Cash, along with the Beatles, Elvis Presley and to a lesser extent, Nirvana, has been one of the most influential artists of our time. Even those artists and bands who claim to have not been influenced by The Man In Black, the bands that influenced them, probably were.   Johnny's final album is a masterpeice in every sence of the word. This is, in my opinion, his best album.  He sure hasn't lost any of his simple brilliance with old age.  Like a fine wine, age has complimented Mr. Cash.   The title track, written by Cash, is the album's best, a dark, intense song about the armagedden, inspired by the last, darkest and most disturbing book of the bible, Revelation.   Hurt, a cover of one of Nine Inch Nails' most popular songs, is a sad song, whether Cash's version sounds sadder than Reznor's, is debatable, both musicans have made a career for themselves through songs of the sad, lonely and dark. It's not a surprise Cash chose to honor Reznor with a cover of the song, Trent Reznor is one of most brilliant artists alive.  Other songs have a much more positive feel and message, We'll Meet Again, the album's closer, is very upbeat, but at the same time, very gut-wrenching in hind-sight, considering it was the artists last studio recording before his death.   Like Joey Ramones 'Don't Worry About Me' and Joe Strummers 'Streetcore' (on which Johnny collaborated with Strummer on the Bob Marley cover 'Redemption Song'), 'The Man Comes Around', is a perfect Epilogue to one of the most amazing careers in the history of music. We're never glad to see an artist we respect and admire go, it was a particularly hard time for me when Joey Ramone and Joe Strummer both died within a year of each other, but, we can take comfort in the knowledge that Mr. Cash is still playing his guitar, making his music and entertaining God and His angels in the heavens above.  Thank You Johnny.    Through music we can live forever    R.I.P. Johnny Cash 1932-2003

B000002MP2|4.0|By leaps and bounds, Green Day's Dookie is better than anything Nirvana put out. Don't let Rolling Stone and Spin tell you Nirvana is a legendary band, because they're not. Green Day, unlike Nirvana, survived the 90's and actually managed to keep their style without compromising. I wouldn't call Green Day 'Punk', because Punk music is tuneless garbage. Like Grunge, the label of 'Punk' allows untalented bandmates to suck at playing their instruments and get away with it. Green Day is consistently solid when they play live, and often surpass the studio versions of their songs. Dookie (and basically any Green Day album) is a great collection of self-depreciative pop music played at a manic pace with a clever slant you wouldn't expect if you just read the song lyrics. Billie Joe practically celebrates the loneliness, boredom, and despair he and Mike Dirnt felt while living in a one-room shack at the time (\\"Longview\\"). And he does it all without even saying he wants to kill himself (which is quite a feat if you've heard the scremo sh*t teens listen to these days). Billie uses his music to not dwell on his problems like Kurt Cobain did. Instead, he used his songs to get his feelings out about such things as his anxiety disorder (\\"Basketcase\\"). Dookie is a great album to play no matter what your mood. It doesn't drag you down, and it will lift you up on those days when nothing seems to go right. You couldn't ask more of an album.
0345403959|2.0|Being a fan of Edding's work I was disappointed in Belgarath.  It was such a long work and I felt needlessly so.  While I agree with earlier reviewers that one doesn't read Edding's for literary genius, I do expect the books to be well thought out and entertaining.  Going into this book you know the outcome if you read the Belgariad.  That makes it hard to inject any suspense into the work, which meant that it needed to be overcome with skillful writing and plot twists.  I didn't feel that there was any of this in this work.  When a situation headed towards a difficult problem the \\"necessity\\" or \\"Garion's friend\\" bailed everyone out conveniently.  I just didn't find this work to be very imaginative and below Edding's standard in the first five books of the Belgariad.<br /><br />This book is like the movie sequel that didn't need to be made.  Does Smoky and the Bandit III ring a bell with anyone?
078322799X|5.0|This is a great one of a kind movie. This movie has some really moody scary moments, it has some really funny moments and a believable dramatic back story. Michael J. Fox shines in this against type performance. The special effects are first rate...take that George Lucas! I went to see this in the theater and I remeber a fat lazy jerk falling asleep and snoring through half the movie only to leave at the end and sneak into Independence Day. I just remember thinking anyone who didn't appreciate this movie was really missing out. Peter Jackson is a film lover first and foremost and you can always tell when you watch any of his movies, this man has passion, take that Mel Gibson! <br />

B0006SSOHC|3.0|This film could have been so much better. As a die hard horror fan I thought this movie had a lot to offer. The story although it borrowed from Seven was still fairly interesting, and the mood was very creepy. The acting however, particulary in the last act falls completely apart. In the theater everyone started laughing that's how bad it got. It's really a shame though, this one had potential. A true blue horror film with an R rating and no cutesy teens. I've heard that much of the acting sucked because the budget didn't allow for any second takes and most of what made it into the film were more like practice takes than real takes. It's really a shame that a jackass like Michael Bay can secure millions for junk like Pearl Harbor and Armageddon, and the creators of Saw couldn't even finish their movie the right way.

All of Shania's classic anthems and trademark songs are included. <br /> <br />Shania has a lovely, charasmatic singing voice and Godly stage presence, her band are awesome and never miss a beat and the overall production of this concert is excellent!  <br />A fun 2 hours of great music and well worth the money!
B0000AXE8I|2.0|What started out as a great and imaginative idea gets totally lost in this messy sequel. This movie is best played with the volume turned off. Decent action segments here and there make it watchable but any and all dialogue should just be ignored...it makes little if any sense. This series really lost direction and seemed to become aimless, which is unfortunate because it seemed this could be a trilogy that could have stood alongside series like Star Wars and Indiana Jones, but instead the second two need to be written off to still enjoy the original. It's hard to make a good sequel, when it happens it's a beautiful thing(Aliens, T2, Spiderman 2, X2, Empire Strikes Back)but more often than not, we just end up with something like Matrix Reloaded.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|I think Shania Twain is the only artist capable of putting out a successful and excellent Greatest Hits package after only 3 studio albums released, that from start to finish still \\"feels\\" like and worthey of being called a Greatest Hits album. <br /> <br />Shania has made so many excellent songs over the years that even her studio albums feel somewhat like a Greatest Hits album on their own. <br />If you are just getting into Shania then her Greatest Hits would be a good place to start obviously, but I would strongly recommend looking into her back catalogue too because although this album is a nice collection, there are still so many great songs which didn't make the final cut due to limitations, such as... <br /> <br /> <br />When <br />Rock This Country <br />Black Eyes Blue Tears <br />I Won't Leave You Lonely <br />You've Got A Way <br />God Bless The Child <br />She's Not Just A Pretty Face <br />Ka-Ching <br />Thank You Baby <br />I Ain't Goin Down <br />In My Car <br />When You Kiss Me <br /> <br />As I said, Greatest Hits albums are always a good place to start and with Shania's Greatest Hits you can't go wrong, it is a great collection and worth every penny!
B00005JNSK|5.0|...That idiots who clearly paid no attention to the film aren't dwelling on the idea that Depp was impersonating Jackson?  Um... hello... DEPP'S WONKA HATED KIDS!  I don't wanna spoil the movie and say why Wonka in this movie chose to allow the brats into his factory, but Depp makes it very clear that Wonka is not socially stable.  He cringes at any physical touch (the scene where Violet hugs him), he picks fights with the children out of the pure inability to understand them (the 'you're all very short' scene), he needs cue cards just to welcome them into his factory... And my final arguement for the day, Wonka has a nose!!!    Anyway, that aside:  This movie was awesome.  I recommend it to anyone on the grounds that it is incomparable to the first; Burton did a great job of making sure that this was a retelling of a story and not a remake of a movie.  Of course the original is a classic, but do not let that stop you from seeing this version, because you may be pleasantly surprised.    Yes, everything is different.  The oompa loompas are somewhat more... disturbing... mostly in the sense that they're all played by the same man!  The 'bad' kids are nastier than in the original, and the 'bad' parents are even more pathetically clueless or tapped into their childrens' faults.  But the message is the same, and of course dear sweet Charlie is the 'good' kid in both films.  A lot of the scenes following the actual tour of the factory follow the same sequences from the old film, and it's of course amusing to draw parallels.  But in this film, we're given some extra exposition on Wonka's character; (oddly enough this isn't the version with Willy Wonka in the title...) and his rise to fame as well as what makes him a fallible character.    I've also heard a lot of people say this movie is like acid on film... well, I guess I can go with that arguement.
0224071262|2.0|Jung chang and Jon Halliday's \\"Mao: the Unknown Story\\" contains a number of interesting and enlightening quotations of Mao and other party officials which are mostly unknown to the public.This is pretty much the only valuable aspect of this book. Unfortunately, there are so many outright distortions and factually untrue statements about every issue discussed in this book that one must be wary of everything but direct quotations (as well as they context these direct quotations are put in), which are mainly printed in collections inaccessible to most (especially non-Chinese).    My review will be primarily focused on the agricultural politics and economic policies of the Mao era, which occupy a substantial amount of space in this book.  The general thrust of C&H's argument is that Mao desired to procure and export agricultural products (as well as other policies which sacrificed food consumption) in order to accumulate industrial capital (as well as finished military products themselves), which was to be used to produce military productts. A strong theme throughout the book is that Mao's military policy did not have defense in mind. Thus, we get a very coherent explanation of Maoist tyranny - people starved so Mao could be the leader of a superpower, and eventually the world. The picture of Mao as uncaring about (and even liking) death which is painted supports this. Unfortunately, the argument utterly fails. My review of agriculture and economic policies will not be exclusively focused on those parts of the book with direct relevance to this thesis.    P.327 states \\"land redistribution was not the main aspect of Mao's land reform. The part that really mattered was...'struggle against the landlords,'.which in reality meant violence against the relatively better off. (In China, unlike pre-communist Russia, there were very few large landowners.)\\" This is a collection of absolutely ridiculous statements. Landlords comprised 4% of the population and owned 39% of the landin 1949. This more recent western estimate of the extent of landlordism is actually slightly larger than that of the party at the time (who did not yet have the ability to collect adequate statistics). See  Joseph Esherick's (who has an unrelated article cited in this book) \\"Number Games,\\" Modern China, 7.4 (October 1981):387-411; Chris Bramall, \\"Living standards in pre-war Japan and Maoist China\\" Cambridge Journal of Economics, 21. (1997):551-570 and his \\"Chinese Land Reform in Long run Perspective\\" Journal of agrarian Change, 4.1. (2004) 107-141. C&H give no source for their claim of the low extent of landlordism.    Further, while the landlords had their holdings strongly reduced, a class of \\"Rich Peasants\\" averaging nearly twice the income of \\"poor peasants\\" in every locality remained. The income share of the richest tenth of peasants was only reduced by 2.8% by the end of land reform in 1952(See Bramall \\"Chinese Land Reform...\\" p.111). Mao himself in his 1950 speech \\"Fight for a Fundamental Turn for the Better in the Nation's Financial and Economic Situation\\" argued for lenience towards rich peasants in order to preserve the economy and prevent them from siding with the landlords: \\"Accordingly, there should be a change in our policy towards the rich peasants, a change from the policy of requisitioning their surplus land and property to one of maintaining the rich peasant economy in order to facilitate the early rehabilitation of rural production and the better to isolate the landlords and protect the middle peasants and lessors of small plots.\\" The text of this speech is available online (incidentally, the short section of C&H's bibliography for online material lists two different databses in which this speech is located).     Basically, the statement of C&H quoted above is wrong in every way.    Pgs. 396-7 state that Mao's plans for industrialization \\"focused exclusively on building up arms industries...According to official statistics, spending...on the military plus arms related industries took up 61 per cent of the budget- although in reality the percentage was higher, and would rise as the years progressed.\\" The only citation is to the official statistics themselves, missing is an explanation of why they underestimate military related spending. And what is an \\"arms related industry?\\" Practically any category of industry has relevance to arms. Considering the fact that heavy industry only accounted for a 42% share of all industry in the year in question (1952) which steadily increased to 65% by Mao's death (Chris Bramall \\"Sources of Chinese Economc Growth 1978-1996\\" pp.148-9), I expect that their definition of \\"arms related industry\\" is quite loose. No more evidence is provided for the assertion that the industrialization program was exclusively military oriented (no one denies that it was heavily military oriented).    The authors go on to criticize Mao for allegedly exporting food in order to build up military capacity. They claim that Mao knew his policies would cause starvation and quote him saying that 10% of households face food scarcity (p.400). However, It is well known that Mao exaggerated claims of economic inequality (it was clear at the time that problems of nutrition were a result of distribution and not aggregate food availability, and later western studies such as Alan Piazza's book \\"Food Consumption and Nutritional Status in the PRC\\" confirm that the average person in the PRC had an adequate calorie intake in the early 1950s) during this time period in order to justify the collectivization that would eventually take place in the mid 1950s. Even if Mao's figure is right and even if he believed it, he was still pushing programs which were intended to redistribute agricultural produce in such a way as to relieve this problem.    The chapter on the Great Leap Forward is abysmal. The \\"real\\" goal of the GLF was apparently to take over the pacific. They quote Mao around the time of the leap implying that he would like to take over the pacific, but provide no evidence that this was a goal of the leap (much less the primary one). The authors rightly point out that ridiculous claims about agricultural yields were pervasive in the late 1950s, and that Mao encouraged these exaggerations. They wrongly conclude (without evidence) that the goal was to use the inflated yield figures as a means to procure a greater amount of produce. In relaity, there was a conflict over how quickly the basic program of the Leap should be implemented. Mao felt it should be implemented quickly, and all those who didn't paint a rosy picture of the economy in the late 1950s were branded as \\"rightists\\" attempting to discredit Mao's radical programs, and were severely persecuted. It is likely that Mao himself believed this nonsense, as agricultural inputs were reduced in accordance with the inflated claims of increased productivity. This of course severely reduced output (as there were no such productivity gains) and was a major cause of the famine (Xizhe Peng \\"Demographic Consequences of the Great Leap Forward in China's Provinces\\" Population and Development Review,13.4.Dec 1987) C&H's evidence that Mao couldn't have believed in August 1958 that China had a great surplus of food is that in January he said there wasn't enough food. This following a few pages discussing the claims of extravagant agricultural output in the intervening months. No evidence is provided that Mao didn't believe these claims.    A more Bizarre argument relates to the massive mobilization of labor inputs during this period, which the authors regard as slavery. Mao did this because he \\"wanted to raise output without spending any money, he latched on to methods that depended on labour, not investment.\\" (p.447) In relaity, labor was mobilized very much, but so was investment! The Chinese investment share was 24.9% in 1957, 33.9% in 1958, 43.8% in 1959, and 39.6% in 1960, followed by three years of less than 20% investment in theaftermath of the famine. The rate of investment during the famine years dwarfed the Maoist era average of 27.1% and in some years even the 36.7% average of 1978-1996. The investment share in 1959 was the highest in Chinese history. this was actually an obvious cause of the famine.    C&H (pp. 456-7) estimate 38 million famine deaths on the basis of a 4.34% mortality rate in 1960 and a 2.83% rate in 1961. The 1960 figure  is nearly twice the level given in the data from the massive census in the early 1980s (the figure given by the 1980s census for 1961 is indeed more than twice as small) but \\"the official statistics published in 1983 are recognized as partly defective, because local policemen understated the number of deaths in the years 1959-61 after some were purged for over-reporting deaths.\\" Partly defective? Their estimate requires the census data to be so radically defective as to be useless. They cite a Chinese study as their source, which contradicts basically every other study on Chinese mortality ever written anywhere. They don't mention how these precise figures were arrived at, and anyone familiar with the enormity of the census from the early 1980s (which investigated demographic trends in the past as well) must be skeptical of how anyone could arrive at an estimate not heavily based on the census. Most Western estimates say 30 million died in the famine. C&H's estimate is only 8 million above this, but such a comparison hides the radical nature ofthe author's mortality estimate. Mortality  had been rapidly decreasing in the years leading up to the famine, and continued to decrease afterwards. Most demographer's find around 30 million deaths in excess of what would be predicted by the trends. If C&H applied their absurd mortality figures to this more common method, they would probably get a figure of around 50 million. However, they simply calculate deaths in excess of those actually realizeed in the years surrounding the leap.    The authors argue thatno one would have died if grain wasn't exported. \\"During..1958-9, grain exports [of] 7m tons would have provided the equivalent of over 840 calories per day for 38 million people - the difference between life and death...Had this food not been exported (and instead distributted according to humane criteria), very probably not a single person in China would have had to die of hunger.\\" As if its so easy to identify exactly how many calories any person needs so as to only distribute that food over a gigantic country of hundreds of millions of people to only the 38 million who need it to survive, despite the fact everyone is consuming dangerously low levels of food!    More distortions deserve mention. they quote Mao's hostile statements in 1959 about peasants who were alleged to be hiding grain. While they cite Dali Yang's excellent \\"Calamity and Reform,\\" they conveniently leave out Mao's later statement, quoted in Yang's book, that \\"I certainly hope [peasants are hiding grain], I'm afraid they have nothing to eat at all!\\" This omission is especially surprising considering that on page 401 the authors quote Liu Shao-chi statements in 1951 about the need of peasants to have consumption goods, and comment that \\"This was the kind of language Mao never used.\\"    I will make one comment about their discussion of the Cultural Revolution: They repeat the line established by the party in 1981 that the CR was a struggle among the party elite. They say that Mao manipulated the Red Guards into trying to destroy his political enemies (typically, the authors don't distinguish between the Loyalist Red Guards and the Rebel Red Guards, the two violently opposed factions whose battles accounted for much of the chaos). In reality, the CR was a struggle which arose out of the fact that a new priviledged \\"red\\" class had been created since the establishment of the PRC, and that huge anatagonisms had built up. It was this priviledged position that the rebles rebelled against. Mao gave confused and contradictory support to both sides (although primarily the rebels) while the rest of the party sided with the loyalists. The major players in the CR were the people, not the party elite! (See Anita Chan \\"dispelling Misconceptions about the Red Guard Movement\\" Journal of Contemporary China\\" 1.1. Sep 1992)    The biggest problem with this book is that they ignore Mao achievements, arguably as or more spectacular than his failures. They call most irrigation programs a \\"stupendous waste\\" while giving an unbalanced review of a small number of them. For a good discussion of their costs and benefits, see Bramall \\"Sources...\\" pp. 140-7. While the problems of flooding and drought weren't solved, they were reduced far below the scope of the devastating   natural disasters which killed millions upon millions in the century prior to communist rule. Microlevel data show yields pervasively increasing with irrigated area. Since \\"Stabilization\\" in 1952, redistribution nearly halved the death rate by 1957. By thee end of the Maoist era, the death rate was a third of its 1952 level. this was a result of Maoist redistribution and health care. As Judith Banister concludes in her classic study (other Banister work is cited by C&H) \\"China's Changing Population\\": \\"Much of the improvement in China's health and mortality conditions since about 1968 may be attributable to the preventive and curative work of the barefoot doctors.\\" Chang herself was a barefoot doctor, according to the back flap, but does not discuss their achievements. The legacy Maoist economic program is a major cause of China's fast economic growth of the last quarter century, as Bramall's book meticulously documents.    To the authors' credit, they make a convincing argument that Mao said alot of really stupid stuff.
0440237688|5.0|I had a friend who told me about this book, and although I didn't want to read it at first she kept pestering me to, so finally, with much dread, I picked up the book and began flipping through the pages. Wow.  Thank you, Maria, because without you I would never have discovered the magic of The Giver.  <br /> <br />Jonas lives in a world very different from ours today.  There is no fear, pain, or suffering of any kind.  Basically, no one has any feelings.  Suddenly, on his twelveth birhtday, Jonas gets an opportunity to discover a world beyond that (and change his own), with lessons from someone he calls the \\"Giver.\\"  The Giver gives Jonas memories of times before people decided to change their world to an unsuffering one, and Jonas realizes that even through the suffering people have (poverty, sickness, hunger) that they get great things as well (happiness, hope, love).  Not one person can finish this book without learning or taking away one thing from it.  Lois Lowry shows how great our world really is, and that we should all be thankful for what we have rather than focus on the things we don't.   <br /> <br />I would reccommend this book to children 11 years and up, because otherwise you can't understand/enjoy the detailed plot line of Jonas's story.   This is one of those books that everyone should read, and hopefully enjoy.
B00001QEE7|5.0|The Little Mermaid was one of my favourite Disney Movies! I love the characters in this movie, especially Ariel and her seven beautiful sisters, Flounder, Sebastian and scuttle! Prince Eric was very handsome and I like him. It was very good that Ariel was together with him! The songs in this movie are very good and enchanted, especially \\"Part of your world\\". Jodi Benson's voice was wonderful and sweet. I hope that she can record a album on her own. I love her voice so much!
B00080ZG1A|5.0|I bought this movie before I saw it, and when I saw it I was so glad that I owned it. I really think Leonardo DiCaprio did a great job as Howard Hughes. He really showed how much of a great man Howard was and how he could have done many more great things had he lived in an era where his OCD could have been treated. <br /> <br />Million Dollar Baby definately deservered to win best picture last year, but if it didn't win this movie would've.
B0002Y4T92|5.0|This is a wonderful treat for any guitarist's eyes and ears, but be warned...If you found this DVD while searching for Pat Metheny related items you will be sorely disappointed to discover that his performance is missing from this program!  Yes...He was at this festival and can be seen chatting with Carlos Santana and a fan during some \\"Behind the scenes\\" footage, but that's it!  No Performance footage! <br /> <br />That being said, this is a fantastic DVD collection of some incredible guitar performances!  :)
6305718954|3.0|I enjoyed the movie very much but was extremely disappointed in the sub-titles.  They were not shown throughout the movie, were inconsistent and sometimes displayed in a foreign language.  I was also disappointed that the movie was produced in wide screen format only.  It was not as pleasurable to watch on a full screen t.v.  The content and quality of the DVD was excellent, however.
B00005T30L|5.0|I went in to Ghost World expecting an oddball comedy, so I was surprised by the nuance, depth, and emotional complexity of this film.  There are some funny moments, certainly, but the whole movie is just too deep, dark, and meaningful to be dismissed as mere comedy.  Your reaction to the film may well depend on what kind of person you are - or were back in school.  If you were cool and ran with the in crowd, you'll probably laugh - condescendingly, of course - at the losers who make up the main characters of the story.  If you were an oddball and have drunk deeply from the waters of alienation, however, you will feel a real kinship with these characters.  The only bad thing about this film is the fact that there isn't enough of Scarlett Johansson in it.  It's really all about the character of Enid (Thora Birch), an incredibly complex character who wears alienation like a crown and tries to avoid total decimation at the hands of a cruel, mixed-up life.  We start out with Enid and her friend Rebecca (Johansson), but - for obvious reasons - Rebecca has a lifeline to normalcy and makes a much better transition to post-high school existence than her friend.  The fact that her partner is crime begins to grow apart from her only makes Enid's journey all the more difficult to navigate - and there is much to fuel her contempt for the world.<br /><br />The plan is for Enid and Rebecca to gets jobs and rent an apartment together, playing pranks and generally complaining about how fake and stupid everyone else is in their spare time.  After Rebecca starts working, though, you can start to see that her heart's just not in their long-held plans, while Enid just sort of sleepwalks through each day with no purpose whatsoever - apart from attending the remedial art class she has to take during the summer.  She does find a project for herself, though - one extremely weird fellow named Seymour (Steve Buscemi).  Of course, it begins with her setting the hapless Seymour up on a fake blind date and watching him suffer through the internal agony of being stood up.  She follows him, though, and the two strike up an unusual friendship.  Seymour is a great collector of classic jazz and blues records and an odd assortment of other things, and he basically lives in that forgotten world he has recreated for himself.  Enid sets out to find Seymour a girlfriend - which is quite a project indeed, as Seymour is almost hopelessly undesirable in the eyes of the world (or at least the 99% of it that Enid hates so much).<br /><br />Then Enid's world starts closing in on her in all sorts of ways.  Always alienated, she now begins to feel completely alone, and she basically keeps sabotaging her chances of reversing course (which is an unfortunate habit most of us weirdoes seem to have).  Every day brings bad news on some front.  By this point, the comedy is basically over and done with, and the final third of the film comes across as a nuanced, poignant look at this poor soul who truly doesn't know what she is going to do with the rest of her life - or even tomorrow, for that matter.<br /><br />I could say more, but this is really one of those films that you can't really explain.  There's no real sense of closure when the movie ends, but that is indicative of life itself - and that is really what Ghost World is all about.  Thora Birch and Steve Buscemi give inspired performances that will stay with you, Scarlett Johansson is marvelous, and some oddball characters (such as Numchuck Guy) round the film out quite well.  It's quirky, but quirky is almost always good.  I'm not sure how older people will react to this sort of film, but the younger generation will see much of themselves somewhere in this weird story, making Ghost World one of the most impressive coming-of-age movies of the new millennium.lind date and watching him suffer through the internal agony of being stood up.

B0006L16N8|3.0|I'm still wondering. Since the album's release, I've listened to it maybe 4 times, and each time I sit down and attempt to really listen, I get distracted. At first, I thought this was my fault, but as I listened to it again I realized: this is just boring.  <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong. X&Y is not a bad album. The problem is that it is also not an exceptionally good album. The musicianship, is, as always, very good, and Chris Martin's vocals are inoffensive even if they tend to melt into the background, making it difficult to hear what he has to say. And from what I have seen, the lyrics aren't all that impressive.  <br /> <br />Given the wonderful A Rush of Blood to the Head, and the very good Parachutes, I'm disappointed in a band I know can do better. I'd listen to X&Y when I need some nice, background noise that won't distract me while I'm writing. It's easy listening. If you're already a fan of the band, you probably have this already. If you're new to the Coldplay fandom, I'd suggest starting with A Rush of Blood to the Head.

6305736650|5.0|I laughed out loud when a younger co-worker told me he had never seen Casablanca - \\"I don't like black and white movies\\" was his reason. Instead of mocking him, I felt pity - as if a person had said he had never tasted chocolate ice cream. Yes, Casablance is that good a movie. The cast, cinematography, plot, script and acting are as close to perfect as you could imagine. Bogart's stunning portrayal of a bitter, cynical man with a broken heart should have won him an Oscar. When he describes his politics to a visiting Nazi honcho with the phrase, \\"I'm a drunkard...\\" it is both comedy and tragedy.<br /><br />To me, the mark of a memorable movie is if there are memorable, quotable lines and here, Casablanca leads the league. \\"I'm shocked, shocked! that there's gambling going on here.\\" - \\"We'll always have Paris.\\" - \\"Here's looking at you kid,\\" - and the phrase Bogart never said \\"Play it again Sam.\\"  Actually, he said, \\"You played it for her you can play it for me. If she can stand it, I can. Play it!\\" Experts say this is probably the most popular movie in the world, an opinion I share. You need this DVD - find someone you love, cuddle on the sofa and let time go by.<br /><br />Proof that there is a higher power can be traced to the fact that B-movie icon, Ronald Ray-Gun was offered the part of Rick and he turned it down.  \\"Who wants to play opposite an unknown Swedish actress?\\" was his reason. The world ows a debt of gratitude to the best decision that man ever made !
0670033375|5.0|This book makes you feel smart - by that, I mean, that when you are done reading Collapse, you feel as though you have really learned something substantial. I did notice a lot of similarity/overlap between Diamond's theories in Collapse and his previous work, Guns, Germs & Steel; many of his terms and postulations were the exact same. The book pinpoints the 5 factors that lead to an eventual collapse of a society, and also illuminates 12-13 factors that are making our own future perilous. The book has also been made into an exhibit at the Natural History Museum in Los Angeles, and was a good introduction to the book. The book is just wonderful and well worth your time.
B0000019PA|5.0|It's frustrating to think that this was and will be Neutral Milk Hotel's last real full LP they recorded. That being said however, it's not hard to see why Mangum decided to call it quits. It would be incredibly hard to catch the brilliance he and his band caught in this album. <br /> <br />In this album, Mangum took the age old ideas of folk, meshed it with trippy lyrics, oddball introspection, added some unusual musical instrumentation (such as the musical saw), and put in a pinch of punk just for good measure. This formula is carried through the entire album and amazingly never gets old, not even after many, many listens. Mangum's voice, while it is a bit nasaly at times, holds the songs together as he strains to reach notes he was never meant to. But this really just adds to the entire tone of the album. He spits out his stream-of-consciousness lyrics like Syd Barrett used to do in the 60's and 70's, only without the insanity (one would think). <br /> <br />\\"In the Aeroplane Over the Sea\\" and \\"Two Headed Boy Pt.1 & 2\\" in particular are ambiguous works of introspective art. What the lyrics mean are anyone's guess. If you read about Mangum in interviews and articles you'll see that all he wants is for people to see the world in a different way, and with lyrics like \\"the dogs dissolve and drain away\\" he hits his mark. It would be very trippy if it weren't so heartfelt. <br /> <br />It's hard to write a review with an album that has so much to do with feeling. The best I can tell any skeptics that aren't sure what to think of this album is to just try and imagine the lyrics. Stop trying to relate it to someone or something and just actually listen to them, and also hear how honest and heartfelt Mangum is in delivering them. This is a folk album at it's core, but for anyone willing to listen and actually HEAR the music, HEAR the different instruments, HEAR the lyrics and realize how well it has all been brought together, you'll realize that this is actually a work ofart.
B0009K7QZ8|2.0|The O.C was like my favorite show during it's first season.  Season 2, oh boy.  How does a show go from being so grood to so bad.  First of all Season 1 left in a place that had very little story to build off of in the new season.  The O.C. Season 2 was just plaine boring, dumb, and really dissapointing.  Despite having a great cast the scripts were just not up to the O.C. standard.  I will give the O.C. some credit, the had lesbians, nice.  Over all the season sucked.  It was way to predictable, and had no twists that left you oh my god.  The Cliffhanger wasn't even that good.  I say don't waste your money on season 2.  It is because of this that I will not be watching next year.  How did the O.C. become one of the most boring shows on televison in less than half a season.

B00005B3Z6|5.0|I had grown tired of the US Queer as Folk series. Sure when it came out it was interesting and fresh, and now I realize the reason why--it basically transplanted lines from the UK series during its first season. After the first season I could no longer stand whiny Michael and ridiculously pathetic Brian (I don't see why he's hot). <br /> <br />Upon watching the UK version however, I was so blown away...so this was what the series was supposed to come across as! Interesting characters, actual death and loss (the death of Phil was a sad but realistic plot point), and Nathan (Justin) actually has a friend in school (WOW!) whom he talks to regularly about his issues! Another thing I couldn't stand about the US version was the annoying Debbie...my God, what a clown! Hazel (UK Debbie) was far more realistic, more maternal 'fag hag' than over-the-top  crazy, radical-left mum. Yeah she parties, but at least she doesn't have crazy buttons on her shirt and act like a 12 year old kid in a 40 year old's body.  <br /> <br />Vince was also a few notches above Michael as a character--slightly immature, yes, but also very realistic and adult-like (I could actually believe he was a store manager), unlike Michael who was just so pathetically whiny and immature that I felt like fast forwarding whenever he came on screen.  <br /> <br />All in all, see the UK version that generated all the fanfare and controversy, you won't regret it!!
B000000OMP|4.0|This is the best of the Whitesnake, a solid effort on every track with blues ripping songs like the mighty ZEPPLIN.    I will always have this CD in my collection when I feel the need to hear (WS) its the one.    Saw them in concert 4 times in the 80``s the songs from this collection where the best live tunes also.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|First off, this is an amazing album by Grohl and Co.  A very solid and consistent effort from the top of rocks current royalty.<br /><br />Second, I've read a bunch of these reviews stating that this album won't play/rip/import on a Mac or an iPod.  I find that very interesting, because as soon as my wife came home with the album a couple of weeks ago, the first thing I did was put it in my iMac and rip it as an MP3 via iTunes and then import it to our iPods.  Worked just fine for me.  In fact, I'm listening to disc one right now in iTunes.<br /><br />Footos, The Freshmaker.
0156027321|4.0|Yann is a pleasure to read.  He has some interesting viewpoints about religion and the world, and his writing is easy-going and relaxing. <br /> <br />There was a lot that was unique in this novel, and the author has obviously done much thinking about the meaning of life in his travels. What was very well done, was that he brought his thoughts into focus in this piece without detracting from the story. Instead, he thought up a very unique character who allowed him to make many points without being on a soap box, and without ruining the flow of story. It was a captivating story, that made me want to keep on reading to find out the ultimate fate of Pi, the protagonist and narrator. <br /> <br />Yann Martel is a thinker, but he doesn't use his story as a bullypulpit.  Instead, we are gently persuaded to think again about certain things in religion and the world. He invites us into Pi's mind, and gives us a new window on the universe. Among the gifts, which a writer may hope to give an audience is a new worldview and entertainment; to enlighten and inspire, and to cause one to wonder about something, after having seen it in a new way.  Mr Martell succeeds in doing all that in this thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable novel. <br /> <br />He poured a lot of years of thought, travel, and work into this book, and it shows. I think most people who like to read, will enjoy this effort. <br /> <br />Michael P. Sakowski <br />Author \\"The Enterprise Zone\\"
B00005V3Z4|5.0|This is remarkable. Richard Kelly (II) has done something quite unique here. It will stay with you afterwards; figuring out exactly how the plot holds together is not the easiest thing in the world either. Why should it be? <br /> <br />Have you ever slept in your bed when suddenly an engine from an airplane crashes through the roof? Have you been inclined to time travel, or to talk through things with some rabbit? Like James Stewart. Have you been frustrated in school, or with how things work out in general? The portrait Jake Gyllenhaal does here is extremely suited for the plot, exact and without ever over-playing his character. He becomes Donnie Darko. Mary McDonnell does the mother, as usual she's very reflective and precise as an actress. She's a success in her troublesome role. Many other roles are equally fascinating - Drew Barrymore, among others. Every character in this movie has something amazing going for them, and they certainly melt together beautifully in the overall context.  <br /> <br />It's also 113 minutes full of surprises. You will not be able to even guess or have a clue what will happen in the next scene, in the next development... The whole plot will keep you on edge. Enough said. See it!
B000000OAN|5.0|Night at the Opera is probably Queen's signature album containing \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" a staple of AOR radio. Contrast this song with such other Queen numbers as \\"We  Will Rock You\\" and you can see the range of the band.  There are no weak songs or filler on this album, unlike some other Queen albums, and Freddy Mercury was at his outrageous best.  The quality of the recording is very good.  I saw this act in person and with a proper sound processor, the CD can sound almost as good as live.
B00068NVI4|5.0|The much-delayed live DVD from Yes' 35th Anniversary tour is finally here, and it was well worth the wait.  The sound is good, the direction and editing are good, the performances are stellar musically, and the whole thing is put together very well.   <br /> <br />If you weren't able to see the tour, then you'll especially enjoy this DVD immensely.  This is unlike any other Yes tour.  The first thing that is unique is the inclusion of an acoustic set, which is fun and informal, but includes some impressive music.  Second, this show is a true retrospective of the band's entire career.  We get the standards, of course (\\"Your is No Disgrace\\", \\"All Good People\\", \\"Starship Trooper\\", \\"Owner of a Lonely Heart\\", etc).  But the rest of the show is made up of rarely-played material: two songs from the early albums (\\"Sweet Dreams\\" and a terrific \\"Every Little Thing\\"), an ABWH song (\\"The Meeting\\"), finally some inclusion of music from the mid-90s (\\"Mind Drive\\" and the intro from \\"Footprints\\" dressed up as a short song), two Rabin-era songs (\\"Rhythm of Love\\" plus the obligatory \\"Owner\\"), some newer material (\\"Time is Time\\" from MAGNIFICATION and \\"Show Me\\"), and a few deep cuts like \\"Turn of the Century\\".  The whole thing kicks off with \\"Going for the One\\" and culminates  with a searing \\"Ritual\\".   <br /> <br />The highlights are an amazing rendition of \\"South Side of the Sky\\", one of the most emotional performances of \\"And You and I\\" I've ever heard, the gorgeous \\"Wonderous Stories\\", possibly the most perfect Yes song ever, and a truly lovely \\"Century\\".  Other really great moments are Rick's lovely piano intro to the acoustic set, his solos in the Rabin-era songs, Steve's beautiful \\"Second Initial\\" which closes the acoustic set, and of course Chris' bass solo in \\"Ritual\\", although it is not as long or as raucous as I've seen it before. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this DVD to other Yes fans.  If you enjoyed the band's other DVD releases in recent years, then this one will certainly not disappoint.  I'll have to go back through my collection to reevaluate everything, but this may be one of the best DVDs Yes has released.
B000002A3T|5.0|I got a late start in my Pink Floyd listening... just after high school.  But I'm very in debted to my good buddy who got me interested in them.  At the time, I was introduced to Floyd with such classics as The Wall, and Dark Side of the Moon.  And as much as I believe both of those albums are rediculously good, and some of the best music ever made, deep down I find myself liking the Floyd that centers around David Gilmour.  From Comfortably Numb on the Wall, to Wish You Were Here, and others from semi-classic later albums, I learned to truly appreciate the musical genius of this man.  Not only do I believe him to be maybe the greatest guitarist in rock music, but he's got such an incredible voice that captivates the listener, and blends in so well with all his songs. <br /> <br />If Division Bell works out to be the final album by Pink Floyd, then they will have gone out in style.  From the first few tracks, most notably Poles Apart and A Great Day For Freedom, to Take It Back, Coming Back To Life, Lost For Words, and High Hopes.. it doesn't get much better than this.  This cd is both anthemic, and subtle at the same time.  I've used this cd as background music, and also cranked it in the car.  I could listen to this at anytime, and feel it doesn't grow old or tiresome.  That's the true testament to a great cd.  This is lasting, and merorable, and truly moving.  I so admire David Gilmour and Pink Floyd.  I do hope they record again sometime, but will be content in knowing that I've got some of the best music out there, and have a favourite in this album.  A must have!
B0009OPO0S|4.0|Overall, I think this CD is really good. The fact that she doesn't try to sound the same on every CD, like most popular stars, is one of the things that sets her apart. It shows her range as an actual artist, and not just the usual untalented recording industry fad. <br /> <br />One warning, though. This dualdisc version carries a warning about how the audio side does not comform with CD specifications and may not play on all CD players...which at least in my case includes my computer CD player. It just won't work, and I can only listen on my stereo.

B00003CX9E|5.0|The short judgment I have on Citizen Kane is that it's a grand masterpiece. It lives up to reputation. Many are the souls of the cinema, surely, who have joyfully hailed it through the years as simply the best movie ever made (e. g. The British Journal \\"Sight and Sound,\\"1982; American Film Institute Top 100, June 16, 1998 has it both as NR. 1). They are not wrong, they are not wrong... <br /> <br />That might of course be because of the glowing originality, or the splendor it shows in it's composition, the techniques it deploys, the bald and ferocious statement it ultimately makes on American and Western culture. There could be many things in there that causes the praise.  I primarily go for the substance and the statement it makes while focusing in on Charles Foster Kane's decaying life, more so than the technical aspects. <br /> <br />There have certainly been many other precious movies to appraise, Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf, Annie Hall, The Time of the Gypsies, Short Cuts, Apocalypse Now, Godfather, Pulp Fiction, The Bicycle Thief, Nostalgia, and many others. Notwithstanding these great films I can't deny the fact that Citizen Kane has the staying power and a tremendous impact. To me it comes through most of all as the awesome comment on the cultural life of Western societies, built by greed for money, where newspapers and other mass media supposedly are controlling our lives. The blind faith we also might give those at the pulpits -- the politicians -- is ruthlessly examined as it quickly erodes. What shows is what remains: false hopes and the tragic void creeping inside of us while only living for \\"Western\\" materialism that could never help Charles Foster Kane, of which he was painfully aware. <br /> <br />The crash of course on Wall Street 1929, and the ensuing depression years gives historicity. The years following the crash were depressing years indeed, before Franklin D. Roosevelt began \\"The New Deal\\". Equally it did damage to Kane's empire.  It's morethan anything else though a personal tragedy to witness the inevitable downfall of Charles Foster Kane. First the fall from politics, \\"caught in love nest with singer\\". Then fall from marriage of Susan Alexander; the fall from his whole life, eventually left with nothing but a mansion in Xanadu, echoing so clearly the crazy falsity of hopes placed in riches or in comfort of empty materialism. The welth, what will it eventually do for our happiness? Nothing. Then what's it all been worth? You can forget about all the cinematics and the techniques of this picture for a moment while enjoying just the Kane drama. <br /> <br />There really hasn't been a movie quite like it since.  <br /> <br />\\"The Battle over Citizen Kane\\" gives valuable information and thus accompany the film very well. <br />
B00005JMYI|3.0|When I saw the ads for this film, I expected it to be hillarious -- and some of it is.  But the other half of the film is in sore need of editing.  This IS the uncut version, so maybe the theatrical cut was more even, but this version has some scenes that just seem pointless.  The beginning of the film contains a warning saying that this is the uncut version and contains nudity, but honestly, there's no nudity in this film, and in fact, I didn't understand what made this film \\"uncut\\" at all -- there wasn't anything racier in this that you wouldn't find in any other \\"R\\" rated comedy.  The only thing \\"uncut\\" about this film seemed to be all of the pointless material that seemed like IT SHOULD have been cut! <br /> <br />Anyway, the film in a nutshell is as follows: Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) and his news team are the tops in town.  It's the 70's, and TV news is an all-boys club -- until Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) comes to town. <br /> <br />There are 2 really funny scenes that make this film worth at least a rental.  In one, Burgundy and his news team face off in what is essentially a gang fight with several other local news teams.  This is followed by another very funny scene in which Burgundy and his news team sit around and discuss the fight that just took place.  Especially funny is weatherman \\"Brick\\", played by that guy who plays the boss on NBC's trainwreck remake of BBC's \\"The Office\\".
158799190X|4.0|I really liked this book.  I would consider it a good read for any trader, especially one that has had much recent success and very high win rate.  Must read for option sellers.
1582403589|5.0|This is a great zombie story with some real depth.  Any true lover or horror movies will love this book.  The art is wonderful as well.  I found myself stalling on pages after I read the dialogue just to gaze at the art a little longer.  This is saying a lot considering it's in black & white (not just in re-printing, though.  The original comics are printed in black and white, too, so you're not missing out on anything by buying the volumed version here).  This is a good deal too: 6 comics in one volume for $9.  If you bought the actual comics, it would be exactly twice as much.
B0009KA7BS|2.0|Keanu Reeaves is boring in this supernatural detective mystery. Good sfx and rachel weisz is always easy to look at but there is no plot worth mentioning...
B000000OAN|5.0|A Night at the Opera <br />Queen's Fourth Album <br />1975 <br /> <br />A Night at the Opera is without a doubt, Queen's best album. It starts of with the heavy metal \\"Death on two Legs\\". This is one of those songs that after a while will become one of your favorites. Then you have \\"Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon.\\" Very poppy. Very short. But it's an interesting song and the best part is the last 20 seconds. It's a solo from guitarist Brian May. One of the many areas on A Night at the Opera that show Brian's increasingly amazing guitar abilities. <br /> <br />Of course there is \\"You're my Best Friend\\", a very 60's, 70's song.  <br /> <br />Now I'm going to talk about what may be the best song on the album. No not \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\". I'm talking about \\"'39\\". The sad thing is, no one has ever heard of it. It's a more acoustic tune, written by Brian May. The writing is just amazing. <br /> <br />Bud I couldn't leave out \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\". The very diverse, and very long tune by Freddie Mercury. Anyone will like this song. Why? Because it changes styles every two minutes. <br /> <br />Great Album. Worth buying. Five Stars.
B00005JKC3|1.0|The making of this movie was approached in all the wrong ways. First off, Eric Bana was not only the worst choice to play Dr. Banner(hulks alter ego)he is quite possible the most boring actor around. He also has terrible dialogue and plays the role like a mope. Jennifer Connelly as the girlfriend didn't know how to bring passion to her part. The idea that the Hulk had to be computer generated was a mistake. It could be debated that their was no other way to bring forth such massive size and power in a human type form, but their were a few other technics left unused. The computer image was distractingly cartoonish. That was not the face of the Hulk that I know from comics. Not nearly mean enough looking and way to boyish. Their were a couple of scenes that accurately portrayed the Hulks jumping ability but thats it. I kept waiting for something of interest to happen and all I got was an overdose of dim lit scenes and non compelling techno babble. Sam Elliot was a great choice for the General but he was too passive. The comics had a rip roaring Hulk hating General(sorry cant remember his name). The Banner/Hulk transformation scenes were bad. It was almost as if it was hidden at times. I thought a Hulk movie would blow me out of the water. The ending reminded me of the old werewolf movies;werewolf shot/changes to man/people are sad/no one is genuinely surprised. I was left not looking for another Hulk film, at least not of this kind. Their was all that hoopla about the director and his artistic style, forget it. The dvd has pixleized moments especially on the computer made Hulk. The audio is good, but the soundtrack is not memorable. Take a pass, it will prevent a Hulkout.
B0009MDPYM|3.0|I'm a big fan of the graphic novels, so there was minimal disappointment at a few items. Firstly, there were far too many liberties taken w/the source material. Midnite is neutral: Gabriel is actually sympathetic (1st part of movie). There is much borrowing & mixing of elements. It saddens me that they A. Stripped Connie of his cockney accent, B. Relegated Chas (Chandler) to a young, overeager apprentice (I always moan about sidekicks: it seems to be Hollywood's quickie answer), & C. twisted the story around (L.A instead of London, Connie was a suicide, he uses some kind of holy shotgun, that sort of thing). Hollyweird really needs to stick to the original storyline more often. The FX was pretty good, the storyline w/the twin women was fairly original, which is why I'm giving it 3 stars.
B00005K3NR|4.0|I first saw this movie at the theatre when it first came out.  I was in highschool at the time.  This film seemed to have a profound effect on teenagers at the time, about bullying and what it means to be different, and how we treat others.  It was also entertaining, despite it's differences from King's novel which I also highly reccomend.  Both Alfred Hitchcock and DePalma have a similar way of story telling--but DePalma does have his own unique style.  Like Hitchcock, DePalma knows how to deliver a wonderful scene without the use of dialogue--and make it so that the audience knows exactly what's happening--now that is neat.  \\"Carrie\\" is the perfect subject for this type of film treatment, just as \\"Marnie\\" was for Hitchcock.  On the DVD commentary, DePlama is self- critical of his use of split screen for the prom sequence--but I thought it was pretty cool and original.  There were things that DePalma wanted to do in this film but couldn't, due to studio pressures.  The commentary on the DVD is interesting.  Wonderful acting all around.  The only liability is the idiotic dialogue between Billy and Chris (Argh! Even at 17, I thought it was painful to listen to) and also Chris and Billy don't appear that they are mean enough (or intelligent enough) to be capable of doing what they eventually did.  What's missing is the fleshing out of Chris's character, that she suffers from the lack of attention from her rich parents who only bale her out when she gets into trouble rather than helping her and that she, too, is uncared for--which would have explained why she was the way she was.  Instead, here she is a bimbo and Billy is a moron.  But hey, DePalma only had something like 90 minutes here to turn King's novel into his own vision, so something had to go.    But this did not prevent me from enoying the film.  Being before the use of computer generated imagery, the special effects were  staged--and very effective  (I truly miss that in today's movies).
B00009P1O2|4.0|This was odd to me at first however I brought it along to a party of a bunch of us 40 somethings and it was a big hit. I have never seen Queen in concert before, just love their music. It was cool, sad though, knowing Freddie's story.
B0002858YS|5.0|I first heard of The Killers when they performed in Late Night with Conan O'Brien and started searching high and low for their album rightaway. It took me some time but I finally got my hands on it and I can safely say that the purchase has definately not been a disappointment! <br />The opening song 'Jenny was a friend of mine' immediately gives the listener the idea that they're sitting in a garage, listening to their friends rehearse. But there's more to the Killers than garage rock. The band combines this sound with a type of retro-punk and new wave to create their own specific sound, which can be heard all throughout the album. Radio hits such as 'Somebody told me', 'Mr Brightside' and 'All these things that I've done' will be enjoyed over and over again, but there are some lesser known gems on the album that you simply don't grow tired of hearing. Personal favourites are 'Indie rock and roll' and 'Smile like you mean it', which Brandon Flowers and his band performed on The O.C. and which combines a great melody with haunting lyrics that show clearly how special this band really is. <br />An album more than worth picking up, especially for people who like the type of retro-punk as performed by Franz Ferdinand, The Libertines and Rooney. I would definitely recommend it, you won't be disappointed!
B00070Q7VO|5.0|Michael vocal talent are so amazing, he sang every song in the album beautifully. This is a fantastic jazz/blue album, probably one of the best jazz/blue album in the world. My personal preference: <br /> <br />Feeling Good <br />Home <br />Quando, Quando, Quando <br />You Don't Know Me <br />Can't Buy Me Love <br />Save The Last Dance For Me <br />You And I
B000001FDQ|5.0|Around '86, a friend came over with his 70's Fender Strat and a record with fire artwork on the cover and said to me \\"So you think Van Halen's it? Listen to this!\\" I was floored and have never heard anything like it at the time, except the closest was Randy Rhoads w/ Ozzy (R.R., another legend).    I remember listening to \\"Black Star\\" over and over and over non stop. Then came the impossible \\"Far Beyond The Sun\\" and said to myself \\"how could this be, how could he play so fast and so much?\\" Although an instrumental album, there were a couple of powerful vocal tracks on the album with some real long scorchin' guitar solos. My favorite track of all is the instrumental \\"Evil Eye\\", this complex composition, with its dark and powerful classical phrases powered by both electric and acoustic guitars double-tracked dead on note-for-note...are examples of just how amazing the guitarist was at the time. Not only that, the song was executed with precision along with Jens Johansson's \\"guitar-like\\" keyboard solo which interluded harmoniously with Malmsteen's frenzied blazing guitar solo. By far this is a break-through album and open doors for many others alike, but will never be duplicated. A great album that can be enjoy listening to...from yesterday, today and tomorrow to come.
B00005QDW5|5.0|This was the first Pink Floyd cd I ever got, and to me it was a great place to start. The 2 disc set entitled \\"Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd\\" is an excellent collection of the group's greatest songs ever from both the Syd Barret and David Gilmour eras.

B00000JGHM|5.0|What is it that makes this movie one of the best of all time?<br /><br />First off, it is the fact that all the necessary ingredients are combined here: great plot, great actors (the 2 best living male actors on the planet - and even the ones playing the smallest supporting roles are superb), a well-balanced mixture of action and emotion, aesthetic scenery (no other movie makes L.A. look so beautiful), phenomenal soundtrack (!!), Michael Mann's perfect directing.<br /><br />Second, it's the film's basic message: Heat shows that it's impossible to live a life full of adventure in perfect freedom *AND* a life in security with a loving partner. The smart and experienced LAPD detective Vincent Hanna (played by Al Pacino) and the ingenious criminal Neil McCauley (played by Robert De Niro) both refuse to live a simple, boring life with an ordinary office job, so they both take the bait of living life the dangerous way. At the same time they both yearn for a good and lasting relationship with a woman, but they fail because they have to spend most of their time on the streets: Hanna neglects his wife because 24 hours a day he's obsessed with the idea of catching the bad guy, and McCauley is constantly on the run. As the two rivals are very intelligent men, they soon realize that they are two of a kind, so they begin to respect and even to admire each other, yet without ever forgetting that they are (natural) enemies.<br /><br />Third, this movie is closer to real life than you might think. The fact that Heat has so many passionate fans, is it only due to the things I mentioned above? No. At least not in my humble opinion. I'm convinced there's many a viewer (especially males) who lives an ordinary life of deadly routine despite loathing it and dreaming secretly of thrill and adventure. Always torn between the longing for freedom on the one hand and the longing for non-freedom and love on the other... So Heat can really be a *gift* to such viewers... But how many people havethe courage to *admit* to being stuck in this dilemma? (Only a few, I guess.)<br /><br />And the most emotional scenes are so touching, and accompanied with instrumental music so artfully they will make you quiver inside.<br /><br />Heat is 170 minutes, but it felt shorter for there's not one boring minute in it.<br /><br />Even if it sounds like a banal phrase: Heat is a MUST for every cineast!<br /><br />Watch and enjoy!
B0007GAERG|5.0|This album is full of amazing melodies and Shake It Off it sound like she uses 4 different voices
B000002542|5.0|I wish Journey had made more music. It's really that simple!<br /><br />The first two albums (this is the first) are more about the music than the lyrics, although some of the lyrics are fun in that true-to-self way that slicked-up industry pap can never hope to duplicate.<br /><br />For me, Journey was always about the music anyway, so it was quite a delight when I first found cassettes of Look Into the Future and the original self-titled album in the back of a record store in the late 80s, after the band had had its big breakup. I didn't get what I expected: I got something even better, a musical treat has the same Journey magic behind it, but a distinct mid-70s quality to the sound. This is kind of hard to explain!<br /><br />There are only two ways I know of to come to be interested in this music. One is to know it already (either by original listenership or having been a fan for decades) and the other is wanting everything Journey produced after coming to love their sound so much that you hunt around and discover these older albums. If the former, you don't need my review. If the latter, then the earliest Journey albums will either delight you or disappoint you, depending on why you like Journey.<br /><br />More than half of the music on the original albums is unaccompanied by lyrics. If you only know Journey at its popular height, from songs like Separate Worlds, you'll still find the oldest stuff to be true, but only if you actually listen to Journey's later stuff as an album. (If you pick and choose songs, and only like the ones with your favorite lyrics, then these old albums are probably not your cup of tea.) Separate Worlds has an instrumental-only interlude near the end of the song. If you appreciate THAT, then I think it's a safe bet that you'll enjoy the first album they sold. Start your Journey journey right from the beginning! You won't regret it.<br /><br />If you like some of Journey's grand but not widely played songs (like People and Places, Sweet and Simple, Opened the Door, and the widely played but often truncated Lovin'Touchin'Squeezin') then the early albums are must-buys!aces, Sweet and Simple, Opened the Door, and the widely played but often truncated Lovin'Touchin'Squeezin') then the early albums are must-buys! <br />
B000683VI4|4.0|When my fiancee and I first met, one of the things we found out about each other is that we loved to read. We couldn't decide on exactly WHAT to read, so we went to our local bookstore and picked up one of the newest novels we could find (mind you this was a few years ago). And it just so happened that we picked up Nicholas Sparks' novel, The Notebook. Definitely a \\"weeper\\".<br /><br />So when we saw that a film had been made about the first book we'd read together, we decided to give it a go.<br /><br />Like the book, the film dips us into the lives of Allie and Noah, two star-crossed lovers (excuse the cliche') living in the South who are Romeo-and-Juliet worlds apart. The movie moves us between their much older, present-day lives living in a care facility, and their young-love days during the 1940s. Allie now - in 2004 - has Alzheimer's and Noah reads her a story (their story) day after day, repeating it as often as he can, and, sometimes, Allie's mind comes back to him and they can bask in the glory of their love and lives ...but only for a few minutes before Alzheimer's rips her back into oblivion.<br /><br />We also get to see how difficult it was for them to come together as youngsters. Allie comes from a life of privilege and money, while Noah doesn't have two nickels to rub together. Allie is educated in language, the arts, and music, while Noah works at a saw mill factory. But the one thing they DO have is an unbridled love and passion for one another that neither of them can forsake. Not for family. Not for money. Not even for time and a memory stealing disease.<br /><br />******************************************************************************<br /><br />The most impressive things about this movie are the on-location sets and the acting of Gena Rowlands and James Garner. The plantations, in all of their pristine glory, were spectacular to behold, as was some of the cinematography which used a multitude of beautiful white geese.<br /><br />But if there was one thing that held my attention (and kept the tissue box near at hand), it was the performance of Garner and Rowlands. They played so excellently together that it was easy for me to believe that these were once two people who were very much in love. And when the older Allie comes back to the older Noah towards the end of the film, I doubt that there will be a dry eye anywhere in the world during that scene.<br /><br />Although all of the above was near perfection to watch, I did have some problems with the movie. For instance, when the young Allie (Rachel McAdams) finally comes back to the young Noah (Ryan Gosling), the film - with regards to their young lives - ends abruptly. I know WHY they did this, but it still felt stilted.<br /><br />Also, Alheimer's patients fail to maintain their faculties in a linear fashion, quickly losing their most recent memories, while retaining the older ones. So the fact that Gena Rowland's character recognized her nurses in the care facility but didn't recognize her husband, her story, nor her children, rang a bit hollow for me (I'm in the medical field by the way). But most people probably don't know this, so it wouldn't be that big of a deal to them.<br /><br />Even with these problems, it's a very decent film. I loved the performances (including Sam Shepard as Noah's father), and the 1940s sets were pulled off quite well. It's a movie well worth seeing but, like many others have pointed out, keep the tissue box close by.

B00005MP58|5.0|Having found the book, Pride and Prejudice, somewhat late in life, I was surprised at what a treasure it surely is.  Having completed it once, I immediately began it again.  And then in wishing so fervently for these new best loved characters to come to life, I searched Amazon for what might be available.  This BBC/A&E miniseries is as much a treasure as the book itself.  The cast is superb and the production is something of which I think Jane Austen herself would be proud.  I have watched it as many as 4 times now, and I am still mesmerized by it.

B000002UJQ|5.0|First of all, Ok Computer is, and will (probably) always be my undisputed favorite album.  As for the best album of all time, the extraordinary number of 5-star reviews you beautiful people have contributed speaks volumes.  I am not an authority on music, but I can recognize musical brilliance, and Ok Computer is the finest example out there.   <br /> <br />For a laugh, if you find yourself frustrated by those sporadic negative reviews sullying the Ok Computer reputation with a fragrantly low 4.5 stars, check the sources.  For instance, Illmatic's 1-star dismissal of OK along with the claim, made 8/3/05, that Springsteen's Born to Run is the greatest album of all time.  After you recover from some spasmodic laughing, check out the rest of his reviews.  You'll soon realize that those negative reviews lend credibility to the greatness of Radiohead.
0375420525|5.0|Having braved the first 50 pages of this monster, which I believe to be the hardest to get through, I find myself completely and utterly enthralled with it.  Every spare moment is spent delving deeper and deeper into this waking nightmare.  I read it constantly, even taking time to decipher the encoded letter from Johnny's mother.  But the weirdest thing about this book, is how it twists ones mind.  After wandering my way through half of the book I start having nightmares.  Not being one prone to nightmares I find this a bit unusual.  One would think a person reading such a skewed book would have nightmares somehow related to the book, but not I.  For three very long nights I had terribly vivid, graphic and distubing dreams.  Some involving finding myself in a coffin with two decomposing bodies, and some with your basic everday worm slipping and sliding it's way underneath my skin. Promptly after completing the book, the dreams stopped.  It has now been a year and a half since I finished the book, and just as long since my last nightmare.  I think I might have to dust it off and see if I can have some more fun with it!
B0009A1AS2|4.0|Overall nailed the balance between human emotion and frenetic virtuosity.  Like Rush with their classics, DT will never quite top \\"Seasons\\" or \\"Scenes\\" for be-here-now brilliance, but hopefully they will ripen just as gracefully.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|Although I got hooked on Sufjan Stevens when I listened to Michigan and Seven Swans, this album is just so well conceived and so amazingly executed that I was taken aback. This thing is huge, yet nearly every song can stand on its own. Buying this cd was well worth the price; I feel I've made a great investment. This is going on my top 5 list (at least) this year. There's just so much to love about it.
B00003CXCT|5.0|yes, but... I was pretty surprised to see the \\"new\\" Anakin at the end of Episode 6. <br />I had not intend to watch the whole double trilogy (Is there a word for a 6 movie suite?) right away. I was waiting to get Episode 3 on DVD, but couldn't wait, I guess. <br />My wife had never seen any of the Star Wars movies, which was good now, because when Episodes 1 and 2 came out, she started watching them... Last week, we watched them again, on DVD, as a \\"refresher\\" and a couple of days ago we watched Episode 3 in the theater. That same night, we watched Episode 4. Last night, Episode 5 and tonight 6 (we just finished). In a way, it makes sense to see the \\"new\\" Anakin at the end of Episode 6, especially if you watch all 6 in a week or so. However, they could and should give us the opportunity to buy the \\"Original Trilogy\\" the way it was, and from what I've seen with other reviewers, I am definitely not the only one who'd buy them again, as they had been released over 25 years ago. The music changed, too. I remember listening to the Ewok song at the end of \\"6\\", but they removed it. <br />Don't get me wrong, I like the new ones, too. <br />I just wish they had the \\"Original\\" available as well... Surely Mr. Lucas doesn't want us to hang on to the old video tapes? Ironically, the Star Wars Trilogy (on VHS) are the last 3 video tapes I own. Everything else has gone to DVD. If they don't release the \\"good old ones\\" on DVD, I guess I'll just have to burn them myself on DVD-r.  <br />Now if Mr. Lucas wants the money, he can simply release the originals, don't need to fix anything, add anything, remove anything... just transfer them to DVD. If he wants the fans to get what they want, and don't really care about the money, then he should listen to them, otherwise, they'll just burn their own copies on DVD, from VHS or LD.  <br />In other words, give the fans the choice... you want the new one, fine... you prefer the old ones, fine, too. <br />: ) <br />
0385512058|2.0|In my own life, it occurred to me that I have difficulty staying in contact with people I know and reaching out to people I don't know. I want to do these things without being a smarmy, conniving, smily sycophant.  Then I see the author on the Today show saying he could show me how to do these things and maintain my integrity too!  Looks like he was just using his book's tactics to get $20 out of my pocket.  It's a most elegant irony that there is actually a chapter on the \\"networking jerk.\\"  The rest of the book will make you exactly that.  If he cut out all the self-promoting passages about his own accomplishments, the book would have 1/3 fewer pages.  The only words of real wisdom in the book are but common sense that happen to be difficult to put into practice (e.g. Be generous and don't keep score).  His real formula is this: Have your Dad get you into a fancy prep school, go to Yale, go to Harvard, latch onto someone with a great idea and become their protege, voila - you're a CEO.
B0002IU988|4.0|I really like this album (showing my age.)  It starts out strong, gets a bit mellow and generic in the middle tracks. . . a la Creed radio tunes. . . then kicks it out in the end.  It simply rocks big hooks in several tunes, and I doubt the religious \\"feeling good about life\\" overtones could creep out even the most serious agnostics and atheiests. Heard they got some TV time lately.  I'm rocking to this, hope you will too.
B00006GO9Q|5.0|Listening to Miles Davis has made a jazz lover out of me. I was never crazy about jazz, but after I listened to In a Silent Way I was hooked on all of Miles Davis' music. I also love Kind of Blue, and a lot of his other music. In a Silent Way is jazz at its very best. The kind that touches the soul.
B000002H97|5.0|There is nothing left to say about Metallica.They made the best heavy metal-rock album and bring it into the daylight with keeping the rebel sense of movement. <br /> <br />This is the one of the best rock albums has been ever made.
B00000K31V|4.0|I love movies/books that question reality. We are all so sure that what we see and feel around us is real, but is it? Just like we are sure that time is linear. Maybe those things are all illusions designed to trick us into believing that this is real so that we can experience life, but that ultimately reality is somewhat different. These answers we cannot know until we leave this life, but they certainly make for interesting contemplation. Movies like eXistenZ only help in that contemplation. I really enjoyed it.
B000002U82|5.0|What hasn't been said of Dark Side of the Moon? An album that is truly timeless, each song flowing into the next to form a sonic journey which will never bettered. <br /> <br />Pink Floyd have created other masterpieces, but what makes DSOTM so  special is that it was created by the entire group at their peak, and so draws from the strengths of each member. The result is a fantastically balanced and varied work, and yet one which carries a strong theme throughout. <br /> <br />If you only own one album, make it this one.
B000077VR3|5.0|...is how 'spectacular spectacular' this movie truly is! The timeless theme of forbidden love thrown in with catchy (and familiar) songs make this movie an instant classic! From the first time we see Christian step off the train into France, we are drawn into a magical world of truth, beauty, freedom, and 'above all things, love!' You will be dazzled by the expressive dancing and passionate music found inside the Moulin Rouge. So step inside the double doors into the Moulin Rouge and be prepared to be blown away.

B0000214F0|1.0|Maybe in your dreams, Gore Vidal. Most of our dreams, even the ones with the endless tunnels and the abrupt falls off high cliffs, are quite a bit more coherent than CALIGULA.  The title of this review is a direct quote lifted off the hour long `making of' special bundled with this uncut version of the controversial 1979 release.  Now, to qualify everything I've said so far - quoting Vidal is a little unfair.  During the special Penthouse publisher and at least one-time movie producer Bob Guccione always refers to the movie as GORE VIDAL'S CALIGULA.  Whatever sweet spring of good feelings the principals enjoyed during the making-of special had apparently soured by the time the movie was released.  Vidal disowned the film prior to release and his credit is the rather clumsy `Adapted from an original screenplay by....'  And `uncut version' is usually called `director's cut,' but here there's no director.  The special identifies someone named Tinto Brass as the director, someone the overhead narrator approvingly characterizes as `sex obsessed.'  By the time the film was released, Brass was no longer director and his screen credit was the meager `Principle photography by.'  As far as I can tell Brass was a soft-porn sleaze-meister of minor accomplishments, his major achievement prior to CALIGULA being something called `Salon Kitty,' a 1976 sexploitation flick about a brothel keeper in Germany during World War II.<br /><br />  CALIGULA does have its share of heavy hitters.  Malcolm McDowell plays the title character, Peter O'Toole is the disease ridden Tiberius and John Gielgud plays the moral Roman senator Nerva.  Tragically, Gielgud's character dies thirty minutes into the movie, O'Toole's dies about fifteen minutes later and we're left with two more hours of movie.  A lot of the remaining two hours are filled with orgies, punctuated now and then with disgusting scenes of gratuitous violence. The plot fits in there someplace, sometimes, just as long as it doesn't get in the way of the orgies.<br /><br /> Frankly, this is a mess.  The sets are big and gaudy, but poorly lit and phony looking.  McDowell's Caligula is simply repellent, as are all the other characters after Nerva's death.  The sex is soft core that verges towards the hard stuff now and then.  There are a lot of naked Penthouse Pets in this one, but watching them get it on with each other is no less boring than any other uninspired porn offering.  I wouldn't recommend CALIGULA to any but the curious, and only then as a rental.t in the way of the orgies.     <br /> <br /> Frankly, this is a mess.

B0006Z2LH4|4.0|CUBE ZERO is a pretty good prequel to the 1997 original. I liked the way it explained the origins of the Cube device.  <br /> <br />Definitely see this, but watch the original first, or the ending wont make sense! <br /> <br />Just dont bother with CUBE 2: HYPERCUBE.
0380789035|5.0|This book will not disapoint, if you have even heard of Neil Gaimen this book should be on your must read list. Part action, fantisy, mistery, and road trip. This book will keep you turning pages into the late night.
B00005JNTX|5.0|This movie has a moral center, and for that I love it.  It's definitely a man's film (and graphic novel), and at the center of each story is a man who will give his life to protect a woman.  What's morally ambiguous about that?
B000001FA4|4.0|This is the first U2 album I purchased. To be fair, this album may have been a bad choice for first album, but I believe it's a fair representation of some of the great music the band is capable of!<br /><br />This is an arty, experimental piece of music that I believe anyone can enjoy... if they have the patience. The album mainly focuses on the late Martin Luther King, and the Hiroshima Bombings. Bono's voice truely is magnificant, and it's accompanied by an always excellent guitar from The Edge, and competent backing instrumentals.<br /><br />From the ten tracks available, there is a healthy fantastic to not so great ratio. A Sort Of Homecoming is a gorgeous song that successfully draws listeners into the compelling world this album creates. Following that, Pride (In The Name Of Love) has to be one of the greatest protest songs ever created, focusing on Martin Luther King and his bid for freedom. Powerful guitar and a defiant chorus makes this song a true U2 classic.<br /><br />More great songs include Bad, which is a song about a friend of Bono's who died of a heroin overdose. The song starts out slow, and slowly gains momentum, bringing with it a tidal wave of emotion that you're not likely to find in any other song. Indian Summer Sky is a fast paced, enchanting song backed up by some great supporting vocals, and MLK is a touching closer to the album, once again paying tribute to Martin Luther King.<br /><br />The best song on the album, however, is the title track. The Hiroshima bombings caused destruction that was hardly forgettable, and this beautiful song refreshes our memories. This amazing song can also be interpreted as a love piece... it's ambiguous, mysterious, and extremely pleasing to the ears.<br /><br />As great as this album sounds, there are still a few hiccups. The two songs in the middle, Promenade and 4th Of July, seem a bit shapeless and unnecessary. Elvis Presley And America, while displaying powerful emotions, is an odd piece that more often than not confuses the listener, and is hard to interpret. And Wire, while a fast paced, catchy song, feels out of place between Pride and Unforgettable Fire.<br /><br />I would just like to say that his album is not an easy one. Like I said, everyone can enjoy it, but this is NOT an album you will like first time around. Repeated listens will allow the albums beauty to unfold before your eyes (ears?), and evidently each of the songs, even the weaker ones, have an important place in this piece of art.<br /><br />A very nice album that is far from forgettable.more often than not confuses the listener, and is hard to interpret.

B0000009SY|5.0|Plain and simple, one of Zappa's best. Zappa's brand of pop songs with fantastic musicians and great, catchy melodies. Top it off with a plot about banning music, sex with robots, groupies (this is a Frank Zappa album remember), knocking Scientology, Catholic girls and music critics. \\"Joe's Garage\\" is definitely one of the happiest songs ever made. \\"Lucille\\" is Zappa doing reggae (!). And it also contains the greatest (and saddest) guitar solo of all time, \\"Watermelon In Easter Hay.\\" They actually played it at Frank's funeral. It proves that Frank was the greatest guitarist that ever lived. Good album to start with if your new to Zappa.

B00003CY5J|5.0|Anything Robert DeNiro does has to be tops and always worth watching.  \\"The Score\\" is one of the tops of the tops.  DeNiro is superbly rational and fearsome, Ed Norton was a relative newcomer in this movie and with all that talent will be a star for years to come.  An added plus is Marlon Brando in his last movie role, and he was, as always, great - and always Marlon.  A super treat, even if it did come out years ago.  An edge of your seat thriller, without all the gratuitous violence so loved by producers as a coverup for bad movies.  This is not a bad movie - it stands on its own as a wonderful entertainment.
B0009HLDFU|1.0|Nope.  I'm not buying this one.  I'll never buy ANY CD containing so-called \\"copy protection\\".  Thanks for making this CD useless to iPod users.

B000A2RRF4|5.0|No matter how much someone can claim to love or hate Michael Jackson, one thing everyone can agree on, even if not on the surface, deep down everyone knows that he was THE greatest entertainer of all time. This concert is the example of what pop performances should be, but of course no other pop performance will be on par with this one. This is the greatest performance of all time. How he could make the thousands and thousands of people sing his songs, How he could make them all adlib just like him, with his Hee-Hee's and OWW's. How he could make them all wave their hands from left to right. How he could make thousands of women, AND men, pass out and cry over him. He was magic.. but like many of the greatest in our time, he was brought down by the rest of the world. This is a sad DVD because it shows how greatness can be snatched away from you like: That.
0553573403|5.0|I can't believe I have never heard of this book before, especially after noticing it already has well over 1000 reviews.  I thought it wonderful!  It's fantasy, of course, in a separate world with possible creatures (the people don't believe in them, but the reader is introduced to them early in the story) and court intrigue.  I like the fact that Martin switches chapters between most members of a family and two possible enemies, who really aren't enemies yet, but they don't know that.  I've read another book recently who did the same, but they had soooo many characters they would switch between, but soooo much time lapsed between, it fairly ruined the story.  That definitely did not happen in this one.  Martin did a supurb job of keeping the action flowing and still helping the reader stay in-tuned with the characters.<br /><br />The book is filled with romance, war, court intrigue, and a lot of betrayal. I can't wait until I get my hands on the next one.
B000002MUW|5.0|Released in 1994. Copies sold:- 7,000,000. <br /> <br />Bedtime Stories is another one of Madonna's most under-rated albums. After the critically slammed effort Erotica, in 1994 Madonna returned with Bedtime Stories, which is a R'n'B/Hip Hop/Urban effort from Madonna. Bedtime Stories bagged up four hits in the US, which were Secret, Take A Bow (US #1 for seven weeks), Human Nature and Bedtime Story. Take A Bow is one of my favourite Madonna songs ever, and definately her best ballad. It's her biggest hit in the US. <br /> <br />1. Survival (3:31). 10/10 <br />2. Secret (5:02). #3 in the US. 10/10 <br />3. I'd Rather Be Your Lover (4:39). 10/10 <br />4. Don't Stop (4:38). 10/10 <br />5. Inside Of Me (4:10). 10/10 <br />6. Human Nature (4:51). #46 in the US. 10/10 <br />7. Forbidden Love (4:09). 9/10 <br />8. Love Tried To Welcome Me (5:21). 10/10 <br />9. Sanctuary (5:02). 10/10 <br />10. Bedtime Story (4:51). #42 in the US. 10/10 <br />11. Take A Bow (5:22). #1 in the US. 10/10 <br /> <br />Most of the songs on Bedtime Stories are absolutely perfect, but Forbidden Love just isn't one of Madonna's best songs. It wasn't one of my favourite songs from the album Something To Remember, and it's not one of my favourites from this album. My favourite songs from this album are Survival, I'd Rather Be Your Lover and Take A Bow. Take A Bow is considered one of Madonna's best songs, and it's definately my favourite Madonna ballad. It's also one of her biggest hits, especially in the US, where it stayed at the top for seven weeks! Deservedly so. Survival and I'd Rather Be Your Lover show off a slice of Madonna's best R'n'B songs/talents, and are also excellent. Bedtime Stories is recommended to die-hard Madonna fans, but casual fans may want to buy some of her other albums first.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Hayao Miyazaki is the grand master when it comes to creating animation at its best. I love all of his movies but this one is truely his best work to date. I am not going to tell you what 'Spirited Away' is about since many reviews below has already gone thru that which is kinda bad since part of why this is such a great movie is the suspense as well as the breathtaking visual. His movies are much better than any other Disney counterpart that i have seen including Mulan. There is something about Spirited Away that goes beyond the norm when it comes to animation. It has a human aspect that you can relate to by seeing the reaction in the character faces and you know its not forced or contrived. Its feel so genuine that one cannot describe but enjoyed even long after one has seen it...myself included and i am a tough critic. Anyone who seen 'My Neighbor Totoro', also created by Miyazaki, knows what im talking. Powerful is the word that associate to this movie.  <br /> <br />Oh i have to warn you that his movies will make you cry and this one is a tear jerker for sure so have a box of tissues available for those touching moments cause you will need it as you journey into aa unforgettable place of enchantment.  <br /> <br />The musical score is beauty to my ears...i just close my eyes and enjoy. If this movie doesn't turn you into an anime fan, then you just don't like animation.....period. <br />  <br />Highly recommended!
B000002NJS|5.0|Released in 1998. Copies sold:- 17,000,000. <br /> <br />Ray Of Light is considered Madonna's best album, and the highlight of her career, and I agree. It's her best album, along with another one or two. Ray Of Light features thirteen brilliant tracks, and all of them have the ability to become singles! The ones that became singles in the US are the following:- Frozen, Ray Of Light, Nothing Really Matters and The Power Of Goodbye. Drowned World/Substitute For Love was also a single in the UK, and Little Star teamed up with The Power Of Goodbye in the UK for the single release.  <br /> <br />1. Drowned World/Substitute For Love (5:09). #10 in the UK. (Not a single in the US.) 10/10 <br />2. Swim (5:00). 10/10 <br />3. Ray Of Light (5:21). #5 in the US. 10/10 <br />4. Candy Perfume Girl (4:34). 10/10 <br />5. Skin (6:22). 10/10 <br />6. Nothing Really Matters (4:27). #93 in the US. 10/10 <br />7. Sky Fits Heaven (4:48). 10/10 <br />8. Shanti/Ashtangi (4:29). 10/10 <br />9. Frozen (6:12). #2 in the US. 10/10 <br />10. The Power Of Good Bye (4:10). #11 in the US. 10/10 <br />11. To Have And Not To Hold (5:23). 10/10 <br />12. Little Star (5:18). 10/10 <br />13. Mer Girl (5:32). 10/10 <br /> <br />Ray Of Light was another Madonna album where I had to give all of the songs ten out of ten, even Shanti/Ashtangi, even though the song is not performed/sang in an English language! All of the tracks are excellent and especially powerful, and if you liked the singles from this album, then you'll probably like the whole album! My favourite tracks are Ray Of Light, Nothing Really Matters and Mer Girl. Ray Of Light is a great Madonna song, and she sang the song excellently at the recent Live 8 gig, along with Like A Prayer and Music. Nothing Really Matters is a brilliant song, and I was pleased when it was chosen for single release! Mer Girl is a very spooky song about Madonna's mother's death... It stands as Madonna's spookiest song she's released in my opinion! I recommend Ray OfLight to casual and die-hard fans.
B00000IAU3|5.0|I hadn't listened to this album in forever and came onto amazon to find the track listing for the CD...then I listened to it and was completely blown away again (a small miracle considering I bought it when I was something like 15 and am 21 now).  Take My Hand is probably one of my favorite songs by any artist...any song that can evoke that much emotion on its own is just true music to me.  The rest of the CD is good too.  :)
B000002N3J|5.0|Released in 1995. Copies sold:- 13,000,000. <br /> <br />Something To Remember was released in November '95, 10 year ago, and is Madonna's ballad collection. Madonna was on her way up from the albums Erotica and Bedtime Stories, which the critics slammed and the albums flopped. Erotica sold 6 million worldwide, whereas Bedtime Stories sold 7 million, however, Madonna's ballad collection has sold 13 million copies to date! The album features fourteen of Madonna's finest slow jams, and you can't find many of these on any other Madonna compilation! The album was a #6 smash in the US, but hit #3 in the UK.  <br /> <br />1. I Want You (With Massive Attack) (6:24). 10/10 <br />2. I'll Remember (4:24). #2 in the US. 10/10 <br />3. Take A Bow (5:22). #1 in the US. 10/10 <br />4. You'll See (4:38). #6 in the US. 10/10 <br />5. Crazy For You (4:04). #1 in the US. 10/10 <br />6. This Used To Be My Playground (5:09). #1 in the US. 10/10 <br />7. Live To Tell (5:52). #1 in the US. 10/10 <br />8. Love Don't Live Here Anymore (Remix) (4:54). #78 in the US. 10/10 <br />9. Something To Remember (5:04). 10/10 <br />10. Forbidden Love (4:09). 9/10 <br />11. One More Chance (4:28). #11 in the UK. (Not a single in the US). 10/10 <br />12. Rain (5:29). #14 in the US. 10/10 <br />13. Oh Father (4:59). #20 in the US. 10/10 <br />14. I Want You (With Massive Attack) (Orchestral Version) (6:04). 10/10 <br /> <br />Most of the songs on this album are perfect, but like I said on my Bedtime Stories review, Forbidden Love is not one of Madonna's best songs. It's not one of my favourite songs from the Bedtime Stories album, as well as not being my favourite song from this album. My favourite songs, however, are Take A Bow, Crazy For You and Something To Remember, but I also love Rain. These are, for me, Madonna's best and most beautiful ballads, and Take A Bow, Rain and Crazy For You are even classics to this day! All of the tracks are just brilliant, and I recommend Something To Remember to anyMadonna fans. I definately recommend this album to any tame lovers of music!
B00020HEG6|4.0|I really enjoy this sound track. I would like to have all three of them one day but right now I just have the third one. However, I can't really complain. I personally think that it suits the book very well and of course the movie.
B00004X01U|5.0|Released in 2001. Copies sold:- 14,000,000. <br /> <br />After her great success Ray Of Light, three years later, Madonna released her thirteenth album altogether, and her eighth studio album, Music. The album was packed full of party songs, including Madonna's biggest success story of her whole career: Music. Other singles included from the album were Don't Tell Me, the girl power anthem What It Feels Like For A Girl and American Pie, from the film Next Best Thing. American Pie reached #1 in the UK, as a cover version of the Don McLean classic, but in the US, only charted due to its airplay. <br /> <br />1. Music (3:45). #1 in the US. 10/10 <br />2. Impressive Instant (3:37). 10/10 <br />3. Runaway Lover (4:46). 10/10 <br />4. I Deserve It (4:23). 10/10 <br />5. Amazing (3:43). 10/10 <br />6. Nobody's Perfect (4:58). 10/10 <br />7. Don't Tell Me (4:40). #4 in the US. 10/10 <br />8. What It Feels Like For A Girl (4:44). #23 in the US. 10/10 <br />9. Paradise (Not For Me) (6:34). 10/10 <br />10. Gone (3:24). 10/10 <br />11. American Pie (4:36). #29 in the US. (Only charted due to its airplay.) 10/10 (American Pie is a UK Bonus Track, and is not available on the US Version of the album.) <br /> <br />Overall, Music is an excellent Madonna purchase. Out of all thirteen Madonna reviews I've written so far, Music is the fourth one where I've given every single song ten out of ten. From the party influence on Music, right down to the last track Gone, (or American Pie if you have the UK Version) the songs on this record make a monster of an album! My favourite tracks are Music, Impressive Instant and Don't Tell Me. Music and Don't Tell Me are two of my favourite Madonna singles ever, and Impressive Instant is exactly what it says it is -- impressive! I also loved Paradise (Not For Me) which is one of Madonna's spookiest songs, along with Mer Girl from the Ray Of Light album. They are very similar. I recommend Music to any Madonna fan, may you be casual or die-hard.   <br />
0780622650|3.0|Great premise, great story, interesting effects, until......... <br />they introduce the totally stupid twist with the 'time warped' Will Smith etc. Even for a sci-fi movie it was totally absurd, and the film losses sense and direction for me.

B00005RDSM|5.0|This movie is absolutely one of the best Disney movies! I love this movie so much I used to tell everyone my name was Wendy! A few years back when this came to DVD I wasn't aware of it and I didn't buy it until a few years later on Amazon.com in the new and used part! When you order through that you have to be CAREFUL with whom you choose to deal with because when I purchased the movie I received a bootleg version. It looked normal until I opened the case and it was a fake because of the material used on the DVD. I compaired the DVD with my other Disney DVD's and it was not the same. I spent over $25 on a copy! That really made me mad. If you order from here be aware! There are so many liars out there! I learned my lesson to ask questions if you have any and if they seem suspicious don't buy from them. Thanks I hoped I helped you! But truly this is a wonderful movie for all ages!

0790729652|5.0|I just saw the movie a couple nights ago, and man, i havent had so much fun watching it as i did then! its a rollercoaster of a movie, keeps you watching for all the great performances going on. cmon people, this movie has everything, the Batmobile (still to this day THE CAR to have!) the Batwing (loooooove it!), jack nicholson, micheal keaton, hot kim basinger (though i favor michelle pieffers later performance 10 time over basingers), and that amazing elfman music and themes!! basically, the story is about how batmans first days in gotham city, which is this masterpiece of a city, yes, its an art deco city, and amazing nonetheless. its creepy, keeps you on edge, and scares you! and when Batman shows up for the first time confrointing those 2 thugs after they ripoff some poor family of tourists, its WOW! batman hangs a thug from the roof and the thug screams \\"WHAT are you!!!\\"<br /><br />\\"I'm Batman.\\"<br /><br />What a way to open a movie! Keatons performance is incredible, you can tell how much he puts of himself into this role, HIS role, as in he OWNS thid role. hgis eyes pierce through you in that dark cowl, those eyes that haunt you, want to tear you limb from limb...wow. ppl like to say that jack nicholson stole the show, and i cant disagree more. keatons calm, collected presence MAKES this movie, jack is just there as the evil joker, but far from \\"steals\\" the scenes. plenty of action with the batmobile with some of the greatest music (\\"decent into mystery\\" for fans of the fabulaous soundtrack), and the batwing as well, in one of the most memorable scenes in cinama. incase ppl dont know, the batwing is the \\"batplane\\" used to take down jokers men and save gotham from jokers deadly \\"smilex\\" gas. keatons offbeat, phychologically disturbed bruce wayne fits the tone of this film, and his Batman pefectly. Tim burton may have had a hard time making this film, but what he accomplished is nothing less the pure \\"movie magic\\". the sets are incredible , especially in gotham city, and feels like a real hell hole, making you ponder \\"why would batman want to save such a stinking city?\\" why? cuz his parents were murdered by thugs (not sayin who the thug is to avoid spoilers) and he wants event to never happen to anuone else, there fore becomes Batman. they dont go into \\"how\\" he became batman, but you can see that in \\"batman Begins\\", though its not in the same continum from the burton films. kim basinger is probably the only negative part of this film, probably the studios decision to hire a dumb blonde \\"love interest\\", not burtons. you can find the real deal in the sequel \\"batman returns\\", pieffer is bruces true love, not this blonde disaster. this is a good one, BUY IT NOW!! you will not be dissapointed! dont listen to the negative reviews on this movie, its well done and the acting, especially keaton, is superb, and he nails the true spirit of batman and keeps the mystery intact as well. very serious, has a great score, and just wont let up! youll LOVE IT!! would give it more stars if i could!<br /><br />UPDATE!!!: DO NOT BUY THIS DVD RIGHT NOW!! COME OCTOBER 18, WB WILL RELEASE 2 DISC SPECIALL EDITION VERSIONS OF ALL FOUR BATMAN FILMS, WHICH INCLUDE BURTONS FIRST 2 MASTERPIECES \\"BATMAN\\" AND \\"BATMAN RETURNS\\", AND ALSO SCHUMACHERS DISASTERS \\"BATMAN FOREVER\\" AND \\"BATMAN AND ROBIN\\". REPEAT: DONT BUY THIS VERSION YET!!!! WAIT TILL OCTOBER 18TH 2005!!<br /><br />thank you.s like a real hell hole, making you ponder \\"why would batman want to save such a stinking city?\\" why? cuz his parents were murdered by thugs (not sayin who the thug is to avoid spoilers) and he wants event to never happen to anuone else, there fore becomes Batman. they dont go into \\"how\\" he became batman, but you can see that in \\"batman Begins\\", though its not in the same continum from the burton films. kim basinger is probably the only negative part of this film, probably the studios decision to hire a dumb blonde \\"love interest\\", not burtons. you can find the real deal in the sequel \\"batman returns\\", pieffer is bruces true love, not this blonde disaster. this is a good one, BUY IT NOW!! you will not be dissapointed! dont listen to the negative reviews on this movie, its well done and the acting, especially keaton, is superb, and he nails the true spirit of batman and keeps the mystery intact as well. very serious, has a great score, and just wont let up! youll LOVE IT!! would give it more stars if i could!

6304510861|5.0|I don't care what any boring critic says about this movie.  If they have the nerve to call this a failure, I seriouly doubt their ability to comprehend anything above highschool education.  Lynch is my favorite director, I am biased, but this movie is the reason he's my favorite.  Perfect acting and cast, perfect soundtrack, perfectly messed up storyline that keeps the viewer thinking after the film ends, what more could a fan of movies ask for?  Nudity? Its there!  Violence?  Indeed!  Beautiful compositions and colors?  More than you can fathom.  Personally I love movies that make me think; films with depth.  Some critics have to have everything spelled out to them on the screen. They go wait in line to see Pirates of the Caribbean.  Movies have evolved beyond such simple things.  I wish critics could grow up too.  But thats when the people speak.
B00005JM0B|1.0|Ah, the old Curmudgeon Spidey-Sense.  Never fails. As much as I loved the two Terminator movies (first one especially), I had no good feeling about Terminator 3. And whaddya know? I was right.<br /><br />First of all, the new female Terminator is RUBBISH. They really had shot themselves in the foot creating the T-1000 for T2, because there was no way they could ever have created something more intimidating, more of a genuine, unstoppable threat, than Robert Patrick's. And even though the T-X is 1000 times nicer to look at, she is nowhere near convincing enough. And Arnie's Terminator isn't the same either. It's a lame reprisal of a role, and whilst the jokes in T2 worked, here they grate (they just HAD to have a gay bar in, didn't they?)<br /><br />This wouldn't be so bad if the original movies weren't so good. It's not as if this is some tacky sequel to a B-movie. But it not only tarnishes the originals, it makes them POINTLESS. Basically, \\"uh, yeah, all that stuff that happened in the first two movies, all the lives that were snuffed out, that was for nothing anyway. Sorry.\\"<br /><br />Inexcusable. Pretend it doesn't exist.<br />(...)
B0009QBLA8|5.0|this movie will change your definition of horror movie.  such twisted events occur that you can't believe are happening.  Lynch is a master and this is the film he worked the longest on, it shows!  This version is very good, despite the lack of extras everyone is used to.  Its korean made i think but don't worry, its all in English.  After you watch this you will be reminded of it in all of David Lynch's other movies.  Superb!
B00000G3PA|1.0|Before I start on this crud, let me just say that The Curmudgeon is NOT a movie snob. It doesn't have to be black and white with subtitles for me to love it. I love big, dumb action movies as much as anyone - GOOD, big dumb action movies. Arnie movies (well, some) spring to mind, or Face Off - dumb as a bag of rocks, but still cool.<br /><br />Then there's this. It's dumb, it's loud - and it's really, really BAD.<br /><br />So the world's going to end, a big meteor is gonna come smashing into earth. Who ya gonna call? Er, Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck and Steve Buscemi, amongst others. Not my immediate choice, but Bruce and Steve can pretty much do no wrong in my eyes (well, until this..) so fair enough.<br /><br />To say the script is piffle would be too nice. It is full of some of the most overblown, mawkish drivel I've ever heard (the \\"Animal Shapes\\" scene has to be seen to be believed) and any film, ANY, that succeeds in making Steve Buscemi annoying(!) is just plain evil in my books.<br /><br />There's not many films that have you wishing for a big rock to smash into the earth and end it all. This is one of them.<br /><br />The_Curmudgeon_Hates_You@yahoo.co.uk
B00005JMX6|4.0|Immediately below this review is one by some fool named grinningstupidlyalltheway that should be ignored.  There are few things in life more annoying than a person whose IQ falls squarely within the average range, who brazenly and laboriously pretends to be an intellectual but is just an intellectual poser.  E.g., grinningstupidlyalltheway.   <br /> <br />The following paragraph is pure spoiler, so skip it if you haven't seen the movie and have an interest in seeing a slightly weaker version of Tom Cruise's Joel Goodsen character having adventures with a slightly cuter and hotter version of Rebecca de Mornay's Lana character. <br /> <br />In a nutshell, Matt Kidman is your all-American nerdy but not outright geeky teenager, who falls hard for his next-door neighbor's hot, slightly older niece, who is housesitting for a fortnight.  They have some wacky adventures that she instigates, he discovers some confidence and courage along the way and they start falling for each other.  However, he learns that Danielle is really a porn star, he listens to his porn-loving king of the A/V club nerds friend Eli and in the process of awkwardly trying to \\"score\\" alienates her and Danielle sadly changes her mind about quitting pornography.  Her slimy producer/ex-boyfriend Kelly convinces her to go to a porn industry convention in Vegas to push her films and she leaves Matt and suburbia to return to the hard and unpleasant adult life.  Matt follows her to Vegas to try to convince her otherwise, telling her \\"I know who you really are and you are better than this\\" and the following morning, she surprises him by showing up at his house, convinced he is right and abandoning her unclean past.  However, Kelly the sociopathic pimp-producer becomes furious that Matt has stolen his hottest commodity, tracks Matt down, beats him up, gets him to rob the house of Kelly's far more successful rival, abandons Matt after calling the police to report the burglary and then steals the $25,000 that Mattraised to pay for a Cambodian teenage genius to come study at Matt's school in California.  The gang has some hijinks that involve Danielle getting several of her fellow porn star friends to be prom dates for Matt's friends Eli and Klitz, Eli directs a sexy sex education video at the prom with said porn stars-with-hearts-of-gold and good triumphs over evil and love prevails. <br /> <br />Ok, let's talk about the actors.  There are a fair number of derivative looking actors and characters here, but luckily, I happen to like them all.  First, Emile Hirsh (Matt) looks an awfully lot like one or several other actors whose name escapes me (maybe a young Andrew McCarthy crossed with Leonardo DiCaprio?), but he does a really good job of being initially self-conscious but sweet and subsequently a confident guy who develops into an all-around admirable character.  Elisha Cuthbert is one of the most charismatic actresses of the past decade, having a rare mix of cute innocence, playful deviousness and raw sensuality.  Her character is required to play a provocative prankster, a sweet and lovely girl, a distraught woman who fatalistically succumbs to sinful pressures, a caring supportive girlfriend and the sort of stunning babe every guy (teenage or not) wants fawning over him in front of his best friends and worst enemies.  These variations on her roles are not the sort of character acting that will create the next Meryl Streep, but Cuthbert does a very solid job and the previous reviewer's criticisms should be viewed as what they are - blithering nonsense.  Hirsh and Cuthbert play their roles well, have great chemistry and really make the movie worth watching.  Other actors could be the siblings or children of more famous actors.  Chris Marquette, playing Matt's friend Eli, is a spitting image of a teenage John Cusack, sans freckles.  Tim Olyphant, playing Kelly the pimp-producer, could fool nearly anyone into thinking he is Jack Nicholson's son/clone.   <br /> <br />Ok, this is not a perfect movie and there definitely are some flaws here.  First, Eli doesn't quite have the charisma to be the lord of his A/V club \\"minions.\\"  Second, Matt's attendance at Georgetown is a) too tenuous too late in his final semester of high school, for financial reasons; and b) in any event, his parents live in too nice of a house for him to be quite so desperately dependent on a scholarship to pay for his college.  Third, how does Kelly get his badass 60's Camaro convertible out to suburban California, drive off with Danielle in her car to Vegas, yet then suddenly have the Camaro the next day?  Fourth, how does Matt avoid all negative consequences of showing up to the scholarship speech competition very obviously wired on the Ecstasy that Kelly tricked him into taking?  Fifth, how does Kelly manage to steal the Adult Education master tape they filmed prom night?  How does he learn of it in the first place, how does he know Eli has it, how does he know where Eli lives and where Eli might have put the tape?  How exactly does Kelly know who Matt's principal is, why would he invite the principal to come to Matt's house and how does he convince Matt's parents they should all have a meeting together?  And, this is all at the crack of dawn on either the Saturday or Sunday morning following prom night.  Wouldn't Matt's home town be the last place on earth Kelly would be found given that it is where he defrauded the Cambodian scholar fund of $25,000 and he has no reason to think that Matt didn't go to the police?  Finally, in the end Matt is far too forgiving, if not generous (Matt sends him a box of cigars), to Kelly considering that Kelly a) beat him up; b) drugged him with Ecstasy; c) got him to commit burglary, called the cops on him and abandoned him; d) stole the $25,000 fund for Sam Yung; and e) stole the Adult Education tape.  <br /> <br />In summary, notwithstanding the too-numerous plot flaws, this was a fun, entertaining and enjoyable romantic teen comedy featuring very charismatic actors and an all-American feel-good ending. <br />
B00005JKEZ|5.0|It's Errol Flynn at his swashbuckilng best.  The cast is absolutely amazing with Olivia de Haviland as the sassy Maid Marian, Basil Rathbone as the cruel Sir Guy, and the evil Prince John played by Claude Rains.  If you like adventure, sword fighting, big budget cotume picks, talented, witty actors, and a touch of romance, this is the flick for you.  The picture and sound quality are excellent as well.
B000069CWE|5.0|I've been a LP fan since i first heard them and bought Hybrid Theory.  I think this album shows true talent because it gets to show the individual talent of each member of the band. Mike takes his vocals to the next level and the beats are just incredible, and since we all know how Chester sings on the regular versions on other albums we can see his ability to vary his voice and sing in different tones from what we're used to.  The guests on the album fit in quite nicely and although you're not used to hearing their part in the song once you listen to it you realize its a great match and it mixes well.  There is no outstanding guest and most make a good impression on the album.  The instrumentals on the album are different from what you'd expect from the band but they still fit in to express many of the emotions on the album making them a perfect addtition to show all sides of the group. over all i think its a great remix album and shows how LP can take their already great creations and turn them into something new and even better.
B0009MDPYM|5.0|I do not care what the Critics say I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It did what it was suppose to do and that was to give entertainment in the form of escapism.  It may not be Oscar material, but it is one I will enjoy watching again this week, next month or two years from now.
B00080Z53O|4.0|This is the kind of movie that is most appreciated when watched alone. the movie is slow but doesnt drag. it thrives purely on the development of personal relationships. that aspect often leads to failure if you dont have a perfect balance of strong to weak characters, allowing the weak to grow from the strong, and having all characters be well developed.  <br /> <br />having watched this movie before million dollar baby i failed to see the controvesy in how the four time oscar winner ended. where million dollar baby touches the subject at what seems like a desperate attempt to make sure it wasnt just another boxing movie (completely unneccissary in my eyes but the ending works), this film hits the subject dead on with no fear. its the kind of movie people dream about, well probably just me, because everybody has an opinion on the subject. no matter which side you take or if you are yet undecided this movie brings new light to the debate. it is a perfect decusion peice.
0783219695|5.0|THIS MOVIE WAS VERY GOOD. I'M SURE MOST WILL AGREE. THE EXTRAS ON THE DVD ARE NOT BAD EITHER. WE'VE ALL SEEN EXTRAS THAT ARE JUST TRASH, BUT ON THIS DVD THERE ARE SOME EXTRAS THAT ARE HISTORICAL AND INTERESTING. ALSO THE EXTRA ON THE MAKING OF THIS MOVIE POINTED OUT SOME FACTS YOU'LL NOT KNOW BY JUST SEEING THE MOVIE. GET A COPY FOR YOUR FRIENDS OR KIDS.
B000957O82|4.0|Saw the movie at least 5 times since I purchased the DVD. It's witty, entertaining and refreshing. THE best Will Smith movie I have seen yet.
0792833201|3.0|THE MOVIE STORYLINE WAS ORIGINAL. THE SEQUELS WERE NOT AS GOOD AS THIS FIRST ONE. I SUPPOSE HOLLYWOOD CAN'T WAIT TO TRY TO REMAKE THIS ONE AND TOSS A BUNCH OF MODERN SPECIAL EFFECTS INTO IT, YOU JUST WATCH. THIS MOVIE IS OK, IT'S JUST SHOWING IT'S AGE. WONDER WHAT MODERN EFFECTS WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE IN THIS MOVIE. HEY, I GOT IT ON SALE. WHAT CAN YOU SAY?
B00005AQF7|5.0|This album, as most people know, is just a rap classic. After making his debut on The Chronic, Snoop just showed how good he was on his first solo album. <br /> <br />First off, the production on this album is just damn good. Dr Dre working with Daz Dillinger made the beats that let the whole DPG crew flow to.  <br /> <br />The guests on this album are the usual members of the DPGC..Kurupt, Nate Dogg, Daz, Warren G. <br /> <br />Gin N Juice-Classic song. <br />Tha Shiznit-Damn good song, originally a Snoop freestyle I heard. <br />Murder was the Case-Just a good song. Different from the music video version though <br />Aint no Fun-My favorite track on here. Kurupt, Nate Dogg and Snoop. <br />
B000001FDQ|5.0|Rising Force, the debut album from Yngwie Malmsteen is absolutely phenomenal!! There is not one guitar virtuoso who can match Yngwie's technique and feel for the instrument. Especially, on this release. He is the crowned king of the instrumental guitar virtuoso...period!!  <br />Oh and by the way don't listen to that Kris Frenz dork...he probably listens to rap or this lame punk stuff thats out. Dude...you're just jealous that you'll never be able to play like Yngwie. You might as well bow down and respect Master Yngwie!!
B00005JSGK|1.0|This is a very enjoyable movie with a lot of action and humor.
B0001Z52RU|4.0|Except the people who give this movie 3 stars or less.  This movie was definitely deserving of 4 stars in simply its originality.  You can't deny that you've ever thought of what it would be like to change something in time.  To go back and change something to better your life or someone else's.  This movie completely hits that at all angles showing the downside of what it would be like to change time while showing the plus side as well.  I won't like, I simply do not like Ashton Kutcher but this movie at least made me respect him as an actor, because I now know he can do that.  Amy Smart is great in it as well but I was really blown away by Kutcher's performance.  Great movie, maybe not a \\"must-have\\" but definitely at least rent it.
B0009RCPX4|3.0|I've probably watched Ghostbusters fifty or sixty times since I was seven years old. I know the movie word-for-word and scene-for-scene. It's edited, ostensibly for length. <br /> <br />If this bothers you, avoid this disc. If it doesn't, enjoy a classic comedy on the go.
B00006ZCFH|5.0|Disgruntled fans will tear this album to bits as they<br />self-demise in wait of Erykah's next full-length album.<br />Yet I, whose only Badu album is this still listens to this with pleasure.<br />While in terms of song length it may wander beyond the 7 minute mark on several occasions the production and vocals are amazing.<br /><br />This EP is very experimental and a brave effort for Badu.<br />As I have no other of her works to compare to, judging by the reviews I'm guessing this is not her best effort so far.<br />But hey, don't just be so hung up about it.<br />Although it may lack in songs it certainly makes up for in enjoyability.<br /><br />The electronica and beats are very stylish and simplified.<br />Even though it is an EP it feels like an album and really I think it stands right up there with album standards.<br /><br />Be thankful that it isn't commercial pap, Badu is just showing her creative side if anything else.<br /><br />While some have commented that the lyrics have little depth if any, I beg to differ on some terms, though they can be repetitive. They have excellent syllaballic rhythm and are well crafted.<br /><br />While not an album an EP can always satisfy the patient of us.
B0009HLDFU|4.0|CD1: Pretty good.. The FF boys have done a decent job.. not spectacular.. but decent. The dumbed-down guitar riffs and constant screaming on almost every song left me a little bit worried about their skill level as musicians, (compared to the ROCKIN' Color and the Shape album) I was a bit disappointed. I own EVERY ONE of their albums, and I've watched a steady decline in the quality of songs since \\"There's Nothing Left to Loose\\".. I don't know.. Perhaps they're trying to take the music in a \\"new\\" direction. That's just my opinion. <br /> <br />CD2: EXCELLENT!! Now this is what I call music!! Well done, guys! Thank you so much for redeeming yourselves by not SCREAMING through muffled guitar riffs and over emphasized drum tracks. Much higher quality here, for sure! <br /> <br />I recently got this album, being a bit leary of the Copy Protection notice on the CD jacket.. Whenever I buy a new CD, I ALWAYS back it up to mp3 format just incase of mishaps and scratches.. You never can be too careful. So, being \\"warned\\" of this so-called \\"copy protection\\", I popped the disc in my CD-ROM drive, fired up my trusty Alcohol 120% Program, and made an image of both CD's in about 3-4 min. total time.. easy as pie. Mounted the images on my Alohol 120% Virtual drive, and RRRRRIIIIPPPPEED THE CRAP outta the discs!! NO PROBLEMS WHATSOEVER! I have perfect, crisp, digital 192kbs backups of both CD's on my hard drive. COPY PROTECTION?! WHAT A JOKE!! You people all worried about the protection need to take some computer classes!! GEEESH!!

0143034901|2.0|The review comparing Shadow of the Wind to Andrew Lloyd Webber is apt. This is a lush romance more than anything else: the struggles over the destruction of Julian Carax's novels, the strange Lain Coulbert, the dogged and dangerour police captain Fumero, are all just blocks in the way of the central coupling.<br />While reading it I was dragged in, and wanted to keep going; reading 100 pages or more in a single sitting. When I stopped, and now that I am done, I was and am more aware of gaps, errors and problems in the text rather than its strengths.<br />The paralells between past and present in the book start as interesting hooks between Daniel (the central narrator for most of the book) and Julian Carax. As the book continues, especially in the last third, these parallels and coincidences begin to add up too fast and in too many cute but silly and improbable ways.<br />In the end the story is a hodge podge made up of borrowed elements from many sources. Sometimes this is done effectively. Sometimes it is not. For example, we are treated (twice) to a scene where a blind person learns about someone by feeling a face with her hands. Not only is this cliche, but it's inaccurate of most blind people's existence. Likewise we are twice treated to lectures about television and the death of books, pining over goods in a shopkeep's window, paternalist wrath in the form of a slap and a lock.<br />For me this was a dandelion of a book. At first colourful, it became what looked like a a well-rounded book, but as the wind blew it came apart into hundreds of different pieces. In the end there is not much left.
B00004YKUY|5.0|I bought this on clearance when a chain was going out of business in 2001 or 2002.  I was skeptical, as a fan since 1980, and didn't care for it at first.  Fast-forward to 2005 and I have tickets for the summer tour.  I decided to give Arrival another chance.  I found that there were some gems hidden in there, and that with some track re-arranging, it could carry a listener like Infinity or Escape, both of which have fantastic native sequences.   <br /> <br />So I rearranged the sequence as follows: \\"Side 1\\": Higher Place, World Gone Wild, Living To Do, I Got a Reason, Kiss Me Softly, With Your Love, Lifetime of Dreams; \\"Side 2\\": Live and Breathe, Loved By You, Signs of Life, Nothing Comes Close, To Be Alive Again, All The Way, We Will Meet Again.  That's tracks 1,7,6,8,14,9,10,11,5,3,12,13,2,15. <br /> <br />I left off \\"All the Things\\" since I think it sounds like an outtake from the last Bad English album... <br /> <br />I think this sequence starts strong, builds some crescendos, eases into some decrescendos, and nicely tells the story of how a band comes from the ashes of middle-age into a new life and vitality.  I think the the pinnacle is \\"To Be Alive Again\\" which couldn't better capture the new life that they feel in this resurrected form, then ease into the quintessential ballad (All the Way) before closing with their best coda (We Will Meet Again) since \\"The Party's Over\\" off of the Captured album.   <br /> <br />I'm weary of people slamming Augeri to build up Perry, or slamming post-Frontiers Perry to build up Augeri.  With these songs, and with this sequence, I don't think Steve Perry could have sung it with any sincerity.  They needed someone who was 12 years younger, and without the baggage that the occupational hazards of the rock life bestowed on Perry.  It's just surreal that they have the same first name, rhyming last names, look somewhat similar, and sound awfully similar.  Journey is a band, and this band has re-created the magic of the Infinity-Escape era.  And hopefully this time without the baggage...
0140187537|5.0|Had Steinbeck not also written such works as Of Mice and Men, East of Eden, as well as The Grapes of Wrath, Winter of Our Discontent would be a much better known book.  On par with the books previously mentioned, Winter is an engrossing study of a man and his society.  The story focuses on a middle-aged man and his family, a family that used to have much greater financial and social status.  He is an honorable and philosophical man, who must wrestle with the loss of status and the obvious hypocrisy he sees around him.  We watch his character gradually change as he questions himself, planning acts and then questioning them.  We see as highly charged an emotional moment as Steinbeck ever wrote when, during a confrontation, our hero informs his adversary that \\"You'll feel better, sir, when you have got used to the fact that I am not a pleasant fool.\\" His children show the two possibilities for America moving forward.  This book is worth serious study.
1573226521|2.0|It's not as good as other reviewers say. It's far from Robinson Crusoe or Lord of the Flies. It's more like a mass-market beach read. The entire book is quite superficial, the characters are hardly convincing, the plot is so-so, not very credible, especially the ending. It's nice that he gives some travel-style information on Thailand. You cannot really understand what is behind the main characters, which seem pretty random. There are some episodes where the writer tries to show off some \\"magical-realism\\", but they are pretty pathetic. The book is also unnecessarily violent. Read this book if you have nothing better to do.
B00005JNZ4|2.0|2.75 /5    Diane Lane portrays Sarah, a divorced 40-something woman who her family is trying to find a match for. They show up at her house with photos of elligible men they know, as a kind of intervention, so that she gets back into the dating game. She seems to be the \\"go-to\\" woman at the moment for playing older, single women seeking a fresh start on romance.    Soon, she discovers that one of her sisters has created an online dating profile for her. She is supposed to meet recently divorced Jake (John Cusack) on a park bench. One of Jake's friends saw Sarah's online profile and set Jake up to meet her.    Along the way, she meets the divorced father of one of her students, the grey-haired PhD student Bob, played by Dermot (not Ben or Brian) Mulroney. Both men are smitten with her. She's interested in both. Things happen that sour both relationships, etc.    The acting was fine all around. Christopher Plummer portrays her dad, the single, poetry-reciting 70-something who is looking for companionship since he has already had the \\"love of his life.\\" Liz (Wilma Flinstone) Perkins portrays one of her well meaning sisters. John Cusack (39) was excellent as the boyish, reluctant Jake. Diane Lane is impossibly beautiful at the real age of 40 and that is both part of what makes the film appealing but also less interesting. She's so attractive that you don't stop for a moment to pity her for being a single woman, eating small quantities of chicken at home by herself. On the other hand, her looks make her a very credible love interest for her two suitors. Still, there's not enough crisis to make this anything other than a lightweight, pedestrian, romantic comedy and certainly not one of the very best.    This film is clearly aimed at an older demographic than, say, Wedding Crashers, and some people will find it enjoyable. Based on the novel by Claire Cook.

B00005JMEW|4.0|Self-proclaimed film geek Quentin Tarantino has had the idea for Kill Bill since the days of Pulp Fiction. So he finally releases his film, split up into 2 halves, either for money reasons or for length(I'd say both). And you're watching it with almost a sense of parlor game: was that a shot from an old japanese movie? Isn't that split screen a Brian de Palma thing? And yet the film entertains despite the fact there's many things that you would think would stop you from being entertained. <br /> <br />The plot of the film and the second can accurately be described in one sentence: a woman and several others are killed during a wedding rehearsal only she's not dead and she vows revenge on those that did her in. That's it. You're not going to get any more complicated than that. What fills in the film and the second one is how she's going to accomplish it. Whether it's through getting a sword made by a legendary swordmaker or getting training from a cruel teacher(seen in part 2). <br /> <br />The film does contain many memorable moments. There's that big long shot as we follow Uma into the washroom then follow 2 people down a hallway then into the main hall then follow a different woman back into the washroom in a single take. There's that beautiful snow garden at the end, and the anime sequence which goes into detail about one of the assassins(and oddly enough, the only one of 4 assassins to get anything resembling a backstory). <br /> <br />As usual, Quentin doesn't like to follow typical storytelling laws. Reservoir Dogs was in flashbacks and Pulp Fiction was told out of order. Here it's divided into chapters. So we open the film with the Bride getting her would-be fatal bullet, then we fight one of the assassins in the home which actually took place after the assassin at the end of the film. And it would make sense since the first assassin is more movie-like in it's grandeur than a simple house fight. <br /> <br />One problem is that there's parts where it just seems like they're really piling on \\"the cool\\". Many of the famous and oft-quoted lines from Pulp Fiction were just general conversations like the royale with cheese line and even the \\"say what again!\\" part. Here the whole thing about the Trix rabbit line just seems to be put there for no particular reason but to be a little pop culture-y in the film. <br /> <br />I'd like to recommend the film because it does entertain if you can get past certain issues but be warned: most likely there's going to be a Super Duper Special Ultra Edition someday with both movies edited into one big long epic with extra bonus stuff instead of what we do get(oooh, a concert by that annoying japanese surf-pop group in the film, what fun!). But still, it's a film made by a guy who knows his stuff, just doesn't know how to make it his own.
B000002UAO|5.0|I am the 500th person to review this wonderful piece of art.  This album rocks my socks.  I love this album.  It gets better with each listen.  George Martin's sped-up electric piano solo on \\"In My Life\\" is one of the most satisfying moments in popular music.  \\"Girl\\" is a splendid piece of music which is a harbinger for all the experimental work the Beatles would do in the years to come.  While no one could write lyrics like Bob Dylan, John Lennon attempts, and comes close with \\"Norwegian Wood,\\" a song about a tryst with a vixen, groundbreaking not just for it's poignant lyrics, but for it's use of the sitar.  \\"Run for your Life\\" is a song representing John's misogynistic views in a relationship. Regardless, it is an enjoyable song, but not in the usual Beatles sense.    I could write a volume the size of \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" for each song on this album, but I am strapped for time.    This album marked the turning poin when popular rock music stopped being all about the 45s for the kids amd became an album-centered artform - at least, ONE of the first album-centered albums.      I kick myself for waiting so long to buy this album. Don't kick yourself-buy it.
B00005JMUA|4.0|There's 2 distinct themes when it comes down to comparing Vol 1 and Vol 2: Volume 1 was more influenced by japanese action and grindhouse cinema, whereas Volume 2 is more spaghetti western based. Volume 1 also didn't have any shred of character development: the Bride ripped and sliced her way through everyone without even offering some kind of connection for the audience. All of that has been dumped here, more dialogue heavy with a few action thrown in. Oh what a film these could've been. <br /> <br />Having sliced through 2 assassins in the first one, she's now onto the next 2: Budd, the brother of the titular character and the Bride's main target and Elle Driver, which is the more jealous underachieving side to the Bride. On her way to get Budd, something goes awry and she gets buried alive with us with her. And a bunch of stuff happens until finally we get to her \\"confrontation\\" with Bill. <br /> <br />Her confrontation isn't even a fight per se. It's like an exercise routine in the span of 8 seconds. Instead they talk and talk and reminisce about the troubled old days. There's many parts in the film that could've clearly been cut such as the suspense killing monologue Uma delivers at the very start of the film since she's telling us she just killed all the assassins and has one left. The recent Foo Fighters double cd reminds me of Kill Bill's both halves: chop them and make them one thing and you'd have an awesome movie. Instead we have 2 movies with great parts but not satisfying wholes. <br /> <br />David Carradine plays probably one of the better comebacks in film so far as Bill, a want to hate him but can't character who shows wisdom and a calm demeanor despite being, as he puts it, a \\"murdering b*stard\\". One scene has him threatening to shoot someone in the kneecap(arguably the 2nd most painful place to get shot in, after the stomach), fires a round into some fruit and laughs dismissing it in a kind of \\"I'm just having fun\\" attitude. <br /> <br />The othersare good although I'm kind of polarized on Uma: she has the physicality of the role but there's something...off? Linda Hamilton in Terminator 2 or Will Smith in Ali looked physically fit while still maintaining their performances, here she looks almost awkward. Of course the fan favorite was Gordon Liu(Johnny Mo in the kato mask in Volume 1) as Pei Mei, the cruel but incredibly skillful master who likes to stroke his beard a bit too often. <br /> <br />As with Volume 1, there's a degree of using the genres in a kind of copying way, as if they're paying homage to that style with the only intention of paying homage. Witness the fast zooms when Bride gets her training or the exaggerated whooshing sound when all she does is shake her head. <br /> <br />Everything works fine until she disposes of the last assassin. Then she gets whereabouts of Bill from a mexican, in another duel role with Michael Parks, who played the sheriff in Volume 1. After that the film starts to decompress, she reaches Bill and it just sputters. <br /> <br />Guess we'll have to wait for the Ultra Mega Rare(I love coming up with these)Edition with the film edited into one long(I'm talking at least 4 hours) or one awesome 2 and a half film. But so far, there's a good film here hiding.
B00004Z459|3.0|Okay, so this one's been in my collection for roughly four-and-a-half years now (bought Feb. 2001), and I'm now finally reviewing it. <br /> <br />Yeah, obviously, Linkin Park has gotten lots of bad press from music purists, pretty much ever since \\"Crawling\\" became a hit way back in '01. But, IMHO, Linkin Park is not terrible. I don't hate LP or even dislike them, really. However, they fell far from my favorite band list since I was 14-15 years old. <br /> <br />Yes, I bought this album in February 2001, at the tender age of fourteen (pushing fifteen). I was a high school freshman, angry at everything (as your run-of-the-mill high school freshman goes), and I loved \\"One Step Closer\\". I still like that song, actually, except for Chester's [fruity] screaming at the end. That's one problem I have with Linkin Park. Chester's screaming. He sounds like an angry seven-year-old. (Wanna hear REAL screaming? Phil Anselmo, Burton C. Bell, Tom Araya, Rob Flynn, et cetera) But I'll get to that in a minute. Yes, in ninth grade, I loved this CD. Just thinking about the songs today bring back memories of freshman year and that summer (some good, some bad...). <br /> <br />As for the album itself, yes, Chester's singing does sound strangely sweet, almost boy-bandish. But it's not bad, and it didn't bother me then. And yes, Linkin Park is FAR from metal. FAR FAR FAR from metal. If Linkin Park is metal, Avril Lavigne is underground hardcore. But for what it is, the album is okay. Not too bad, not too great. If I heard it today, I wouldn't be too impressed. But I don't absolutely abhor it, like many purists do.  <br /> <br />Yes, I'll admit my LP fandom waned slightly when they became popular with preppies (the ones I so despised), but I still listened to them for a little while, then I heard Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Pantera, rediscovered The Beatles, Hatebreed, Tool, A Perfect Circle, KISS, et cetera, and, well, obviously... but for what it is, Hybrid Theory is okay. It just collects dust these days, but it's still all right, I guess. Three stars. <br /> <br />Bottom line: there's much better, obviously, but there's also much, much worse.
B000002UA0|3.0|To say that pink floyd is trying to be radiohead or coldplay? On an album that came out in the 60`s ? I read your review and I wonder to myself that you cant possibly be serious. Also anybody that tries that hard writing in ebonics is obviously an extremely confused white kid. But hey let me put it in words you might understand. Fool, you sho` nuff dont know what ya sayin. You be wastin all our time by reviewin stuff you dont know about.You weak, fool. Tell me one band that you play who has had a career last even half as long as Floyd. Radiohead and coldplay tries to be another Pink Floyd. Its a good thing school is starting so that confused white kids wont have as much time on their hands to review stuff they have no knowledge on. For everybody else that is trying to learn about this album, I apologize if I wasted your time. I had to school this idiot a little. I love floyd, and I am impatient with idiots like `numba one fan` here. Click on the link to read all his reviews if you want to witness true idiocy.
B0002EXH4A|5.0|`Rust In Peace' is usually hailed as Megadeth's crowning glory, but there are still a fair number of Thrash fans who prefer the album's heavier predecessor `So Far, So Good...So What!'. <br /> <br />`So Far, So Good...So What!' saw Megadeth as a band at it's most dangerous. Dave Mustaine was hitting the heroin and the booze like they were going out of business. Half the band had been sacked, and the producer replaced. Capitol Records were becoming concerned about the behaviour of the band, and sent them on tour so they couldn't do any more damage in the studio. They need not have worried, as `So Far, So Good...So What!' rapidly went platinum on its release. <br /> <br />Despite the obvious success of the album, Dave Mustaine had always been dissatisfied with the way `So Far, So Good...So What!' turned out, so he went into the studio in 2004 and remixed it, along with much of the rest of Megadeth's back catalogue. He disliked the sometimes muddy mix, which detracted somewhat from the power of the album. There were also a few small details either hidden or missing from the album. The remixing is like an archaeologist scraping dirt and dust from a prehistoric skeleton. It was always obvious what was there, but once the detritus is cleared, sharp, clean edges are revealed, details unveiled, and it all seems more complete. <br /> <br />The instrumental first track \\"Into The Lungs Of Hell\\" is one of the best lead off tracks on any Thrash album anywhere, bettered by Slayer's \\"Angel Of Death\\", but not by much else. Thrash instrumentals are generally about lead guitarists showing off, and in Mustaine and Jeff Young, Megadeth had talent aplenty to display. The lead guitar throughout the song is sharp, bouncing from one man to the other in what sounds like a frantic guitar duel. There is an undefinable quality to the song, giving it a feel like a reinterpreted Classical composition. The remix added a triumphal brass fanfare to the beginning of the song that was absent on the 1988 release. To be honest, the horns don't add a hell of a lot to the guitar-fuelled maelstrom, but they made MegaDave happy. <br /> <br />\\"Set The World Afire\\" was the first song Mustaine wrote on his departure from Metallica, but he did not use it until he was happy with it. The first riff sounds like it would have fitted onto `Kill `Em All' quite neatly, but the rest of the song shows Mustaine's songwriting metamorphosing and developing. The lyrics are suitably cheesy, a song about nuclear war, which it was just about compulsory for every 1980s Thrash band to have at least one of (Metallica's \\"Fight Fire With Fire\\", Kreator's \\"Fatal Energy\\", Carnivore's \\"World Wars III and IV\\", Sodom's \\"Nuclear Winter\\", Nuclear Assault's `Game Over' album etc.). <br /> <br />The cover of the Sex Pistols' \\"Anarchy In The UK\\" actually features Steve Jones from the Pistols on guitar, but apparently he played so poorly that his guitar work was deliberately buried deep in the mix. Legend has it he turned up drunk, plugged his guitar in and just started playing, without tuning his guitar. Inexplicably, Mustaine messed with the lyrics, swapping the line \\"I want to destroy the passer by\\" with \\"I want to destroy, possibly\\", along with a couple of other minor alterations. <br /> <br />\\"In My Darkest Hour\\" is far and away the best song on the album, and the remixing adds another layer of vindictive menace to it. Mustaine wrote the lyrics of the song in a single sitting on hearing the news that friend and former Metallica band mate Cliff Burton had been killed. It is his best lyrical effort, bar none. The song uses a building narrative structure with no verses or chorus to detract from the momentum. The rhythm guitar follows a series of relatively simple riffs that swell to an almighty crescendo. The leads hold a certain angle grinder type quality, which only appear on this album. <br /> <br />\\"Liar\\" and \\"Hook In Mouth\\" follow a similar venomous lyrical streak, which unfortunately Mustaine abandoned after this album in favour of conspiracies, aliens and witches. Oh well... The solos on \\"Hook In Mouth\\" in particular are impressive as Mustaine and Jeff Young trade licks perfect for air guitar aficionados to imitate. Surprisingly, Young's solos are the heavier of the two. <br /> <br />The weaker tracks \\"Mary Jane\\" and \\"502\\" and the inclusion of the Sex Pistols cover pad the album out somewhat. None of them are particularly poor songs, but they seem to have been written and recorded like the band was on autopilot. Still, Megadeth circa 1988 on autopilot was still a hell of a lot better than a lot of stuff being palmed off on Metal fans at the time. <br /> <br />As a bonus, four of the tracks originally mixed by producer Paul Lani have been included on the album. Lani struggled in producing the record, and was eventually replaced by Michael Wagener, who was responsible for the final 1988 production job. Even to the untrained ear, a number of problems are immediately obvious. All four songs sound very thin, even compared to the 1988 release. \\"Into The Lungs Of Hell\\" still has the horns of the introduction left in the mix, but throughout the song, the guitar lines drift in and out, like they were recorded outside on a windy day. Even a song as powerful as \\"In My Darkest Hour\\" sounds flat and a bit gutless. <br /> <br />The original mix of `So Far, So Good...So What!' suffered somewhat because of limitations on time, budget, technology, and probably substance impaired musical abilities, but it was the best that could be done at the time. Metal production in 1988 was far from the refined science it is now, and the leap in the power and scope of technology between 1988 and 2004 is enormous. `So Far, So Good...So What!' was hailed as a flawed masterpiece on it's original release, and has rightly remained a much admired work from a highly influential band.
B0007P3582|2.0|Man, and I thought 50 Cent was good. \\"Get Rich Or Die Tryin'\\" was a great album and that's why it was recognized as the best album of 2003. But this year he fell low on \\"The Massacre.\\" Bad rapping and ugly beats makes this album the most dissapointing album of the year. Bareley on his sophomore album and he already claims, \\"When my CD's drop, they sell the best,\\" or \\"My s**t sold 11 mil.........I'm rich as hell.\\" Wait till your other album drop, see how they sell! And you guys bought 4 million copies of this \\"Trash\\" and still support this guy making more trash. How dare y'all! Did you know that this rapper don't do nothing with the money, he just keeps it to himself and claims \\"I'm rich! Ha! Ha!\\" 50 Cent used to be cool but ever since he dropped The Game from G-Unit, the group has been falling apart. The Game was the savior of G-Unit, he could rap way better than 50 Cent. I hope he gets his revenge on G-Unit. If you guys think this is the greatest album ever then you guys haven't heard Hip Hop. Y'all idiots and stupid. <br /> <br />Let me talk about the tracks fromthis album: <br />1)Intro - What the hell is this?! \\"Happy Valentine's Day?!\\" Now, I know this album was going to be released on February but he could've change the intro. See, he didn't bother to do that. And the shooting part is just sad. <br />2)In My Hood - In the beginning his rap is WEAK! Weak let me tell you! You can hardly hear what he's saying. His voice is weak. His flow is weak! The beat's okay but it's him that kills it. <br />3)This is 50 - What the hell! One of the most weakest songs I ever heard. The beat's awful and so as his flow. <br />4)I'm Supposed to Die Tonight - At last a desen track. I give this track some credit. <br />5)Piggy Bank - This is the worst diss track ever. 50 can't diss. He talks s**t about rappers who has been in the game way longer than he has and these rappers knows a lot about the game. Nas, Jadakiss, and JaRule are better rappers than 50 Cent. He's stupid let me tell you. Wait till these rappers get back at him. <br />6)Gatman & Robbin ft. Eminem - Another cool track you could listen to. <br />7)Candy Shop ft. Olivia from G-Unit - The 1st single of the album. I didn't feel this song at all. I don't know why is song was at the top of the chart. <br />8)Outta Control - Another cool club banger. <br />9)Get In My Car - What kind of song is this? Cars?! Calling women \\"B**ches?!\\" Stupid. <br />10)Ski Mask Way - ???????????????????? <br />11)A Baltimore Love Thing - Not a love song let me tell you. It's about heroin and getting addicted to it. <br />12)Ryder Music - ????????????????????? <br />13)Disco Inferno - 2nd Single. This song used to be cool but then it just got lame. <br />14)Just A Lil' Bit - 3rd Single. I don't know why you guys love this song! It's lame! I don't feel it. The beat is awful and his rap is even worst! <br />15)Gunz Come Out - A song about guns. Yeah, very original. <br />16)My Toy Soldier ft. Tony Yayo from G-Unit - Perhaps the worst song of the whole album. This songs just falls apart or something. <br />17)Position of Power - ?????????????????????????? <br />18)Build You Up ft. Jamie Foxx - ???????????????????? <br />19)God Gave Me Style - Another good track you can listen to. I just don't like the part when he says his CD's sells the best and that no one can break it down like him. <br />20)So Amaizing ft. Olivia from G-Unit - What??? A girls' song? I thought he HATE IT THEM! <br />21)I Don't Need 'Em - 1 min of blabber talk and the other minute just pure instrumental. <br />22)Hate it or Love it(Remix) ft. G-Unit - Simply the best song of the whole album. Period. <br /> <br />Not many good songs are in this but there's some. This is more like a 2-star album then 5. I'm just dissapointed that 50 Cent sink low and perhaps will still sink even lower. Terrible. And you guys him. That's your problem, not mine. If you don't agree with me, go ahead. I really don't care. <br /> <br />If you want to hear the best album of 2005 then get: <br />Be from Common. I guarantee this CD will never want to come out of your player.

B0009R1T7M|5.0|Sufjan Stevens has successfully created one of the best modern, folk-rock albums in the last few years.  As today's music scene was stuck in the pop music rut, then with the frustration of that era came the rock revival.  But then, everyone seemed to get bored with that, and thats when they added synthesizers to create the glam rock phase.  The sound of this album is a wonderful breakout from the current trends.  The artist created this unique sound by using such a broad range in instruments, with everything from banjos to oboes.  The lyrics are just as enchanting, Stevens has filled it with simple lines and stories, while still sounding like a poet.  The upbeat album is scattered with its small portion of more somber song such as John Wayne Gacy Jr.  These songs although quite different from the others, are just what Stevens needed to balance emotions to perfection.  A overall very appealing album that is enjoyable for all ages.

B0000CDL93|3.0|First off I will start by saying that I thought this was a great film.  I truly loved it and bought into the conspiracy theories.  The acting is truly superb and despite the length of the movie it is never boring.  The characters are very compelling and it is a true ensemble cast with a lot of great cameo performances. <br /> <br />So why the 3 star rating?  Shortly before I left for Thailand I saw a documentary on either the Discovery channel, A&E, or the History channel sorry I can't remember which.  This documentary was basically done in a myth busters fashion going point for point over all of the conspiracy theories regarding JFK's assassination.  They use all of the material Stone and the cosnpiracy theorists used and nothing new.  They expose where facts were misrepresented and also where they were fabricated. <br /> <br />It was truly outstanding.  They recreated the shooting.  Showing LHO would have had a couple extra seconds to fire and most likely fired the first shot before the tree rather than after it.  A couple of shooters were also brought in and shot within the original time frame and the new time frame.  Only one person fell slightly outside the original time frame and that is because his rifle jammed.  He recovered and fired quickly. <br /> <br />They show the actual balistics of the firing and use real experts to do this.  There was no magic bullet of any sort.  No extra shooters from the grassy knoll.  One shooter could have easily and most likely have done all of the firing. <br /> <br />The escape down the stairway was not only accomplished it was accomplished rather easily.  In fact one could have done it twice in the allotted time.  The people doing this were only in fair shape and were not winded at all. <br /> <br />The escape from the boarding house was also discredited.  If you look at the witness statements none clearly saw LHO walk the established route.  Stone uses testimony from a very old and near sighted lady as his concrete evidence.  If you take the more plausible routes that LHO would have taken then he would have made it with plenty of time. <br /> <br />Why was Jack Ruby there to shoot LHO?  Jack Ruby was well known to always carry a pistol.  He was at the same place paying off a fine of some sort and decided to take his place in history.  He was there for a reason and not to kill LHO. <br /> <br />The documentary was awesome and changed my mind completely on the events surrounding JFK's assassination.  I highly recommend watching it.  I just wish I could remember its name.  The movie is still fun to watch to get a feel for all the speculation that went into the assasination.  Just keep in mind that most of the conspiracy theorists have twisted the facts to fit their needs.

B0009K7QZ8|5.0|Well I have been a fan of the O.C. since Season 1. However, I didn't watch the entire season when it first aired because I wasn't home most of the time, I got really hooked when I picked up the Boxset a couple months ago. Anyway, I was really excited about Season 2, but I do have to say that I was a bit disappointed at first. The season started off a bit bland and boring. The character Lindsay was really not needed in the show and that whole storyline took too long. Lindsay was a really boring and annoying person and I personally found the season to become much better right after she left. And then ofcourse Ryan's brother Trey came in and made things even better and the show worth watching. Oh and we can't forget about Alex, Seth's gf and Marissa's gf. That was definetely a plus for the show and an unexpected turn. Anyway, this boxset is definetely worth buying because although the season starts off a bit slow it does pick up the O.C. pace that it had in the first season, and you honestly can't miss those episodes because they did carry important information that would later be tied with the rest of the season. So I recommend you go ahead and buy this. It's worth your money.    Oh and don't forget to tune in to FOX on September 8 at 8/7c for the premiere of Season 3. It will definetely shock you. The season will be amazing, and for those who have seen the preview for the premiere episode, The Aftermath, you KNOW what I am talking about. I have a feeling this 3rd season will become the best yet.     (...)

B000059XUI|5.0|Has anyone not seen this movie?  I grew up on this movie.  I've always loved it and always will. And, hopefully my children will love it too since I'm sure I'll force them to watch it with me over and over again.  Excellent acting (especially from Reeve... Superman and Superman II are some of his best work), great (for the time) special effects, and interesting storyline that isn't too comnplicated for children to follow.  One of the few movies that I can (and have) watch again and again.
B0001XALTG|5.0|With witty voice over narration, in a sometimes incomprehensible Scottish brogue, from Ewan Macgregor as the lead protagonist Trainspotting starts of with a delightful introduction to a motley crue of misfits. When we are introduced to these characters that make up his circle of friends, Tommy, Sick Boy, Begbie and Spud all the time moving to the sounds of Iggy Pop's catchy \\"Lust for life\\" we know we are in for a treat. The movie is a humorous, dark, cynical, satirical look at the life of a junkie and the effects of heroin on the lives of himself and his friends.  <br /> <br />It also comes across as a social commentary piece, juxtaposing the mundane activites of everyday society with the fixed purpose of a \\"sincere and honest\\" drug habit. The movie in no way condones the use of drugs but does show the kinds of motivation that initiate it. It's very postmodern in that the movie critiques the \\"grandnarratives\\" of modern society and shows how empty and supeficial they are, even to the extent that a drug habit is more appealing than living exposed to modern-day plastic consumerism hyper reality. The superficiality of society and the norms are starkly contrasted with the real, physical, painful, purposeful life that governs and directs someone on smack!  <br /> <br />Apart from the postmodern themes and ideas that the movie posits, at the end of the day it's just a great piece of extraordinary filmmaking with delighful exchanges, a wonderful soundtrack and a lot of jokes about Sean Connnery! <br /> <br />I don't want to spoil any more of the suprise so all I can do is suggest that you go out and buy this NOW!

B00003CXB4|5.0|Walt Disney's epic film \\"The Lion King\\" gets a well-deserved treatment on Special Platinum Edition DVD after a successful re-release in IMAX and other giant-screen theaters, just like its equally successful predecessor, \\"Beauty And The Beast,\\" (see my review on it), in 2001. Having seen this movie when it was first released in 1994, I was eager to own the DVD, not having been able to see it while it was in IMAX. I won't say much more, except that the all-star voice cast includes James Earl Jones (better known as Darth Vader to \\"STAR WARS\\" fans; see my reviews on those movies, except \\"Episode I,\\" which is partially reviewed in my review of \\"Episode II\\"; I enjoy the \\"STAR WARS\\" saga, but \\"The Lion King\\" is the movie which introduced me to him, I would see the \\"STAR WARS\\" movies about 10 years later), Academy Award winner Jeremy Irons (\\"Reversal Of Fortune\\"; is that movie good?), stage/screen actor Matthew Broderick (\\"Inspector Gadget,\\" the Disney remake of the classic Robert Preston-Shirley Jones pairing, \\"Meredith Wilson's The Music Man\\"; see my review on it, etc), Rowan Atkinson (better known as \\"Black Adder\\" and \\"Mr. Bean\\" to those who like the show), Whoopi Goldberg (\\"The Color Purple,\\" etc), Matthew Broderick's stage partner Nathan Lane and comic Cheech Marin, among others. The only character I do not like is Rafiki (don't ask me why I don't like him, because I'm not even sure why I despise him). Fortunately, he has limited screen time.<br /><br />Disc 1 includes 2 versions of the classic film: the original edition that audiences around the world know and love and the Special Edition, which includes a song from the Broadway show (which is AWESOME-words can't describe it and I'd go over the 1,000 word limit if I tried telling you what I thought of it; no, this time, I'm not telling you what song that is), deleted scenes and other cool bonus features. Sound options include an all-new Disney Enhanced Home Theater Mix, which works very well. The movie itself is presented in its original theatrical aspect ratio: 2:35:1-enhanced for 16:9 TV's. The picture is very sharp. Film composer Hans Zimmer (\\"The Rock,\\" \\"Pearl Harbor,\\" \\"M:I-2,\\" etc), South African composer Lebo M., Sir Elton John, Tim Rice (known for his collaborations with Sir Andrew Lloyd-Webber) and Alan Menken (who had previously worked with Mr. Rice on \\"Beauty And The Beast\\") combine all their respective vocal/musical talents to create a score which haunting, tragic, beautiful, dramatic and romantic, all in one. The best scene, (for me, at least), among others, is the stirring Elton-John, Hans Zimmer/Lebo M. collaboration \\"Circle Of Life,\\" which never fails to move me, even to this day (I'm 19 now, at this writing anyway). Classic movie. Great songs. Digitally mastered by THX for the ultimate in sound/picture quality. Excellent bonus features. \\"More To Be Seen Than Can Ever Be Seen, More To Do, Than Could Ever Be Done.\\"<br /><br />Disc 2 opens up a whole new treasure trove of riches that has \\"Everything you could wish for\\" (the slogan that describes the features on \\"Aladdin: Special Platinum Edition\\"; no pun intended), with an introduction by Jeremy Irons, the voice of the villainous Scar. Find out the connection between William Shakespeare and the origins of \\"The Lion King,\\" and MUCH MORE. PERFECT for the whole family.

B0007TKNL0|5.0|Beaty in music , great photograpy. <br />It is a combination of colors sound and aensibilty . the resault : great moments of enjoy and peace
B000002UJQ|5.0|this is one of the best albums of the 90s. its beauty can be recognized lyrically, melodically, and emotionally. Almost every single song on this album (except maybe electioneering) is nothing short of excellent. i especially enjoy exit music. it is pure genius. the way the simple guitar and soft vocals blend together is great. i think the other standout tracks (though they are all amazing) would be no suprises, lucky, and karma police. if you are deciding whether or not to buy this album, do not hesitate. you cannot be diappointed with this album.  <br />radiohead's work is largely varied, but i personally think this is their best album thus far.
B00003CX9E|1.0|I honestly think if noone can make a film more entertaining than Citizen Kane, we should never waste our time watching any films. The best film ever made!? It's one of the most ridiculous things I've ever heard in my life. Do they really expect us to believe that every film is worse than this? Oh my god!
B00004XOWM|5.0|It is all too obvious that many supporters of Fred Durst that backed up the band when I was in high school have abandoned him in 2005.  Those who steadfastly listen to Master of Puppets and Reign in Blood have succeeded in driving the star rating of this record to be as low it as it today.    Rap-rock may have gone the way of disco and hair metal. And to some, Chocolate Starfish should belong in an ash heap with its pubescent whining and naive skills of guitarist Wes Borland.   But who will really have the last laugh?   After the sounds of Limp Bizkit, Kid Rock and Korn departed the rock stage, someone had to fill in the voids of MTV and radio.  It would be 50 Cent, Eminem, and Outkast, artists who have had records sell over five million copies in the past three years.  Rap has dominated everything from the single charts (This week the top 5 are all hip-hop influenced) to Courvoisier and car customization.    In that same three-year period though, the three big sellers for rock this milleninium were Evanescence (only one that went at least 5x platinum), Linkin Park's follow-up to their smash debut, and Maroon 5.  That does not sound like a golden age of rock to me.  Yet I remember in how rock used to be the dominant genre in the 1990s, even after Kurt Cobain's death with Dookie and Weezer's blue album being a big hit. Pearl Jam was still going strong, \\"Self-Esteem\\" was on the radio and Tool was on 120 Minutes.    The big double album was Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, not Speakerboxxx/The Love Below.    Now radio stations in Philadelphia and Florida have switched their formats from rock to urban.  I know the alternative one in my market went from playing an all alt-rock slate in 2000 to including 70s classical rock because so little has come out in the past few years.   Lollapalooza, once the pride of post-grunge, is now history.    Limp Bizkit, despite that they were even better than Ashlee Simpson in turning off anybody, did much for their industry by incorporating the aggressive rhymes of hip-hop into a standard heavy metal sound.  No doubt, they are out of the spotlight today- but so is rock music to a certain extent.   Really, Bizkit was not just a nu metal-rapcore, etc group but a band that puts its primacy in the vocalist before the guitar player.  The same principle made rap and also country become the two hottest genres today-- it doesn't matter how hard the riffs are but the vocals that a listener can relate to.    The tunes in both genres focused about specific affections like patriotism or inner-city life however the lyrical content in rock music today is too abstract and generic for a mass audience to connect with.    LB had that energy and rage in how their songs were delivered and they succeeded because the way their music was delivered, in whatever way it was, meant *something*.   You don't remember the riff on Rollin' but anyone can recall the shouted \\"breath in/now breath out\\" and track 5 can be best summed up by the taunting \\"My way or the highway\\".    It is fitting that the two biggest acts of modern rock in 2K5, Green Day and System of a Down, are putting politically-minded songs instead of just plainly singing about falling in love.  That is good enough, but not to end hip-hop's domination of the singles charts or American dress or slang.     ^ My point is this. ---> Chocolate Starfish with its unabashed yelling and cursing is a better example for rock and roll in the future than Coldplay's X & Y.    Who listens to that that isn't under 30 or lives in the blue states?
B0001W8Q9Y|5.0|i will out myself and make the incredibly uncool proclamation that their new album, Marbles, is not only good, but one of the best albums of this year; this is not the kind of thing I would ever have expected myself to say. allegedly steve wilson worked on this album and it sounds like it. Although I'm not really a fan of any porcupine tree albums from a songwriting or performance aspect, I do like the textures and soundscapes they've come up with, and Marbles is full of these. <br /> <br />Having been a fan of this band when I was 14 (and not much after that), I never really gave this version of the band a chance and snobbishly decided they were the pinnacle of uncool, as another thread on here suggests. Even a few years ago when I decided to dip back in, I gave Season's End, Holidays in Eden, Brave, and This Strange Engine all a listen: no go. There was just nothing here that appealed to me, I heard only bad power ballads and songs cluttery with instrumentation and poor arrangements. When I heard they'd gone all Bends-era Radiohead after that, I kind of rolled my eyes and figured them for poseurs reaching a desperate stage of their career and didn't bother. But this thread made me go slsk the rest of the records. There are some very high points, and for some reason I missed Afraid of Sunlight, at least half of which is exceptional. the .com album has some uneven stuff but Interior Lulu is pretty great and the last song, House, really does sound like some Colour of Spring outtake. But Marbles is like the good parts of AoS stretched out over two full albums. It has some of the historic elements that, lets face it, this band excelled at: the sustain in the guitar is great (if you like guitar) but never wanky, the multi-part songs (of which there are a few) flow logically and keep your interest. The album has the kind of magnificently melancholy tone that Gilmore-era Floyd tried to accomplish and kept failing at. Hogarth's vocals don't dip into that rockstar bellowy range I know he's capable of; the whole thing is quite restrained and, uh, artful, but not \\"arty\\". I'm sure that not a lot of people will buy this and it won't get any airplay but going by this album, there's no reason that elbow have cred and this band doesn't. I'm sure the name is an albatross they'd kind of like to shed but it's too late for that and they shouldn't have to. We all did things in our early 20s that we're embarassed about now; I'm sure they regard Fugazi with about as much tenderness as I regard that time I threw up on myself at a party.
B000003S5H|5.0|You ever hear a great song, and go and buy the enitre CD, and everything else sucks? Not here. Every piece on Moon Safari is exquisite, from top to bottom. <br /> <br />Timeless, depressing, sexy, inspiring all at once. <br /> <br />
B000002TQV|5.0|This album packs an amazing spin on rock.  From the spacey feel of Planet Telex, to the hauntingly beautiful Street Spirit, The Bends manages to extract an array of emotions from the listener.  No one tweaks guitar sounds quite like Radiohead.  They have such an amazing futuristic sound to them.  You can't possibly go wrong with this album.
B000002HH2|5.0|I love the song I miss you...make me want to get up and dance!
B00005IC2H|5.0|If there exists a polar opposite of Satanic music, this is it.  This is what I like to call \\"heavenly\\" music.  If heaven exists, there is no doubt that Sigur Ros is extremely popular up there.  It's a product of heaven itself.   AB completely restored the little faith I had left in an afterlife.  I only hope I will have this little gem next to my bed when I am dying.

0553573403|5.0|\\"A Game of Thrones\\" is the first book in George R.R. Martin's remarkable \\"Song of Fire and Ice Quartet.\\" This is a riveting epic saga which reads, in part, like superb historical fiction, (the novel is based more on history than on legend or myth), and in part like dark fantasy, with a huge cast of vivid,  well developed human characters - and a few of the supernatural kind also. The conscientious reader need not stay up at night studying in order to become acquainted with all these personages. There is an Appendix at the back of the book with the names of all the royal houses, their kings, queens, knights, histories, mottos, etc.. This story is narrated by multiple individuals, including: Lord Eddard (Ned) Stark, his wife, sons and daughters, Tyrion Lannister - an incredibly rich character, and Daenerys Targaryen Stormborn, the last daughter of the Dragonkings who had ruled the Seven Kingdoms for three hundred years.<br /><br />The setting for much of Martin's \\"A Game of Thrones\\" is the Seven Kingdoms, a feudal realm which has a recorded history that goes back 8,000 years. The author takes us to a period and place where dragons' eggs might still hatch, under certain conditions, although a dragon has not been sighted in centuries. Magic is dwindling. The old gods are worshiped with equanimity, alongside the new. Seasons and weather are different from what we experience. Summer can last for years and then disappear suddenly, giving way to the dreaded, seemingly eternal winter, with its killing cold, icy winds and blizzards.<br /><br />One king rules all seven kingdoms from his Iron Throne in the Red Keep at King's Landing. He is paid homage by the lesser kings and/or lords. Thirteen years ago, a civil war deposed the Targaryen Dynasty, and mad king Aerys was overthrown by Robert Baratheon of Storm's End, and Eddard Stark, Lord of Winterfell and the northern reaches. Robert reigns as King now, but his taste for wine, women, and weapons holds his interest more than attending council meetings and dispensing justice. He has grown fat and bleary-eyed, a major disappointment to his friends and those who fought for him. His wife, Queen Cersei of the House of Lannister, has little time for her husband. Her true love is for power. Cersei's Lannister family, an avaricious and ambitious bunch, are not content to remain in their present positions as powerful royals. They want the crown. If King Robert were to die, Cersei would become the young king's regent. Cersei's twin brother, Ser Jaime, aspires to the most powerful position at court - although he is already a member of the elite Kingsguard. Jaime Lannister had been sworn to protect King Aerys once, but in fact was the one who murdered him - and thus he is called Kingslayer. The royal court is presently filled with intrigue, plots and rumors. Consqeuently, the realm is in turmoil. Queen Cersei has a terrible secret which could bring down the entire House of Lannister, if she does not take the initiative and eliminate her enemies. The \\"King's Hand,\\" (right-hand man), is murdered because of his knowledge. King Robert is so dismayed at the assassination that he travels north to Winterfell, to personally ask his childhood friend and companion-at-arms, Eddard Stark, to take the position, vacated so abruptly. This is not the first time Robert has asked Eddard for assistance. It was Stark who helped him win the crown.<br /><br />Eddard is not cut out for politics or court life. He wants to remain with his wife and family in the North, at Winterfell. Although ice and snow have not covered the land for decades, winter is about to return with a vengeance and Stark senses the danger. An honorable man, Stark rules as his ancestors have done for countless generations. Now however, the entire realm is in turmoil, and though he believes his duties lie at home, he cannot refuse his king. Thus, he enters the game of thrones, where one is said to either win or die. In any case, all are losers here - forthe real threat lies where no one is looking.<br /><br />The Wall that separates the Seven Kingdoms from ancient forested wastelands and tundra lies just north of Winterfell. It is beyond that Wall, that the true danger lurks - evil, destructive forces far more deadly than thousands of mounted armed knights and soldiers are massing their forces to wreck havoc on the land, and civilization. Powers as old as the earth itself are preparing to move. The men of the Night's Watch, who are sworn to guard the Wall above all else, are being slaughtered. Meanwhile, the Seven Kingdoms prepare for civil war, even as the guards in black send messengers southward asking for help. But the dire danger in the North is ignored or forgotten as feudal lords vie for supremecy and bicker amongst themselves.<br /><br />Across the sea, Viserys Targaryen, the heir of the previous dynasty, marries off his sister, Daenerys, to a powerful chieftain in exchange for promises of an army to win back his realm, the Seven Kingdoms. Aided by Ser Jorah Mormont, a knight exiled by Lord Stark, Daenerys will eventually seek to revive the ancient legacy of the Dragons.<br /><br />Martin's prose is fluid and extremely well written. The narrative is riveting! Plots, subplots and counterplots are interwoven throughout as the characters go about their lethal quest for power and wealth. As I mentioned briefly above, the story is narrated by various individuals offering multiple points of view. Since no human being in the novel is totally evil, or purely good, this is an effective literary device, especially in a book of this scope, to allow the reader to glimpse a hero's bad points, or a villain's good qualities. The descriptions are so vivid and three dimensional that this alternate world is really brought to life on the printed page. I was particularly amazed by the drama and originality of the room where the enormous black skulls of the Targaryen dragons are stored.  Exceptionally imaginative writing!  And the three multi-colored, jewel-like petrified dragon's eggs that Daenerys is gifted with on her wedding day - again, the descriptions and the fate of these objects are quite unique. \\"A Game of Thrones\\" is a long book, at 807 pages before the Appendix. However, I just kept on turning them, one after another, and lost track of time. This is a spellbinding and compelling novel of adventure, romance, war, battles, jousts, knights and their ladies, quests, infidelity, love, honor, incest and treachery, etc.. Get the picture? Outstanding!<br />JANAwhere no one is looking.    The Wall that separates the Seven Kingdoms from ancient forested wastelands and tundra lies just north of Winterfell.

Where I do know that they slashed the orignal story-line to pieces, it still gave me enough enjoyment to give this 4 stars. I LOOOOVE old period movies and this is just what the doctor ordered. If you want to see the movie because it came from the storyline of the book, then this is probably not for you.

B0009MDPYM|5.0|This film has everything in it: <br />Horror, action, great characters, some eye-candy (Rachel Weisz on top form), demons, angels, mad special effects, a deep plot that sucks you in the minute you look at the screen, and an overall intriquing idea for a movie. <br /> <br />Keanu plays the part of John Constantine, a thirty-something man who can see demons and angels. He commited suicied when he was a teen and went straight to hell - because it is a mortal sin. But then he came back and has worked for god, sending all the demons and \\"half-breeds\\" as he can back to hell. By doing this he hopes to get into heaven because he is doomed to die of lung-cancer.  <br /> <br />Rachel Weisz can also see certain things, as did her institutionalised twin sister. Its when her sister commits suicide that Rachel meets with Keanu to see if she did in fact commit suicide.  <br /> <br />I wont go any further with the plot, you will have to enjoy it yourself and rent out the movie.  <br /> <br />I would recommend watching it twice at least. The plot is so deep I found it kind of overwhelming at times. The first time i saw the ending i didnt really understand what happened. But the 2nd tme round i saw the movie in all its glory and will definitely be watching it again. <br /> <br />

Besides those, this album is full of good tracks.  I even listen to and enjoy the two Russian renditions, and I don't speak Russian.  Check out the samples, and if you like their voices buy this album.
B00005R87Q|4.0|This is one of the best movies I've ever seen! There's lots of fighting and car racing, many scenes of suspenseful music, some funny parts, and this is one of the few PG-13s with the \\"F bomb\\" in it. Also, there is a ton of good acting and there are many scenes that teenagers and adults would get a kick out of, as well. Vin Diesel, who is one of my favorite actors of all time, does very well here and is cool as always. This movie is great, and I highly recommend it to everyone.
B000050XEI|5.0|It has a dark track, Tempus Vernum, but this album is for the most part glorious.  Some parts of this album are so beautiful and heavenly it makes me feel like crying.  Not too many artists out there can do that to me.  If you like Enya and you don't have this album, definitely pick this up.  This is a must have for Enya fans.
B00006SFLV|5.0|This is one of those cringe-inducing shows that make you embarrased for the characters, but is so engaging you can't turn away.  When the show was on TV, I fell \\"in crush\\" with Jordan Catalano (not Jared Leto, who's actually a decent enough actor that he's nothing like Jordan for real...) right along with Angela.  Some of the plot gets a bit \\"after school special\\"-ish, but not so much as to distract from the characters.
B000000WFU|5.0|Songs of Sanctuary is not as good as The Best Of Adiemus, but then again, what is.  It still has enough good material on it to warrant a five star rating though.  If you don't have The Best Of Adiemus yet, get that instead of this.
0345404475|4.0|Ok, so I'll admit I had a brief bout of aphasia when I picked this title up at the bookstore. A quarter of the way through, I realized the story was painfully familiar as I was certain I already knew this tale...why did images of Harrison Ford keep popping into my head?  I finally made the connection to \\"BladeRunner\\" and went on reading.  It is not the best of ideas to compare source material to film versions.  Each has it's own special qualities and needs to be viewed as seperate entities.    The book is far deeper and explores many interesting themes that the movie only touched upon.  There is an ongoing underlying tone of religion and purpose in life.  The quality of \\"empathy\\" being the only feature that distinguishes humans from the androids is one that makes the reader take pause.  If you feel this emotion, then you are indeed human...but how does one contend with the \\"killing\\" of the rogue androids that look and seem so real and not suffer the consequences as if you had commited murder?  Herein lies Deckard's dilemma.    The religious undertones are evident in the human's faith in \\"Mercerism\\"...a type of oneness someone can feel when experiencing the uphill battle of a man climbing a mountain and being struck down by rocks as he reaches the top, only to start his journey again.  The book decribes this as a way for all earthly humans to feel unification with one another and the trials of struggling through life. Truth be told, this is a profoundly depressing concept!    There is a big brother aspect here too.  The television plays one particular show 24/7 broadcasted from the colonies and one that all humans seem to watch as if they cannot get enough of it...it seems to be a slow paced and redundant broadcast that, in a strange way, feels brainwashing is taking place, showing only one side of life and urging all earth bound folk to make there way to the colonies where life is infinitely better.  Not so.  At one point, this program does its utmost to crush Mercerism as being a complete fraud of a belief.    The empathy factor is ongoing as well.  The need for humans to own animals (real or electric) seems to be an important status symbol as owning houses and cars are for us today.    This post nuclear world is dark and depressing with a sense of nothingness that appears to be taking over.  Yet, society still exisits on earth.  People are living sparse yet purposeful lives, however one gets the sense of even more emptiness and a lack of purpose in the colonies.  This is an \\"us and them\\" story on two levels: humans vs. androids as well as earth dwellers vs. colony dwellers.    Philip K. Dick has written a story with substance and philosophy.  Yes, there is action plotline, but there are deeper messages abound.

B0000027RL|5.0|This is most definitely Pearl Jam's best album.  This album perfectly mixes Pearl Jam's melodic style, the Seattle Grunge sound, and their politics (agree with them or not.)  This album is one of the pinnacles of Grunge.  Unfortunately, after this album, Pearl Jam basically departed from their Grunge roots, never to be the same, or as good, again.
B000067DNC|5.0|These are better than watching the reruns on the SciFi because there are no comercials. Plus there are added features that give you more information about the characters and making of SG1.
B0000028M7|5.0|This album is a grunge essential.  If you have any respect for your CD collection, you'll pick this one up.  I do not like Alice in Chains as much as I do Nirvana or Soundgarden, but this album is the essence of grunge, and is vital to the CD collections of anyone who likes loud guitar with cranked up distortion.
B0007TKNL0|4.0|One of the most successful musicals in the world is now on screen, the new boom of musicals is at their highest with great spectacles like Moulin Rouge, Chicago and now The Phantom of the Opera.  <br /> <br />Probably one of the most talked stories in cinema, it was finally time it came to the screet as it should have been... WITH MUSIC!!! <br /> <br />From the customs, the scenery, the dances, everything is great... The only down point is the Phantom itself. Although I like Gerard Buttler as an actor, I think he wasn't the best choice for the character, the song \\"Music of the night\\" sounds weak compared with great phantoms like Alessandro Safina and the greatest Michael Crawford (The original!). Emmy Rossum is excellent as Christine, she is young, beautiful and definitelly CAN SING!! Big Hurray for her. Minnie Driver is very adorable and perfect! Could not have been a better Diva Carlotta than her... <br /> <br />If you like musicals this is a MUST-HAVE for you!!
B00006V9A0|3.0|This is a decent introduction to Nirvana, it contains the exxxentials, and You Know Your Right should be part of any Nirvana fan's collection.  I personally, however, reccomend buying the albums.  Bleach, In Utero, Nevermind, and Incesticide are albums any 90s rock fan should buy anyway.  Then, if you are a Nirvana fan, pick up the bootleg of You Know your Right.  If, however, you are new to Nirvana, and wanna try this out first, or just want to get the very essentials, and don't plan on ever being much of a fan, this CD is a decent buy.
B000002UAU|2.0|The songs on here are really funky. they have the weirdest songs that nobody really likes. i think that they had potential for this cd but they wanted to do something different. they sure did and it turned out to be bad! sorry, just an opinion! <br /> <br />2 best songs: Day in the Life & With a Little Help.... <br /> <br />2 WOrst songs: within you without you & benefit MR KITE
