B009LDMJGA|4.0|King Animal is not a old classic album but reflect a new direction about the band.Obvious it's not the best album of Soundgarden but the songs have a complex and powerful structure except ''Halfway There ''totally out of context in the album.<br />Actually we don't have fantastic new bands it's just more of the same and Soundgarden returned to prove like a good wine than they can still make good music these days.
B00770KR7W|5.0|I bought this for my daughter in law who is in her twenties. She loves anything Halo and she loves this

034580404X|5.0|I'm a guy and I have never read Fifty Shades of Grey and I dought I ever will.  But my daughter and my wife love this book. I'm not sure what it is about this book and I'm not sure I want to know but the women sure love it.  I bought this set for my daughter for Christmas and I'm sure she will love it.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|The first version of this book (which is this one) is so much better than the other versions! This is another great book!
B009KHBDUU|5.0|If you are a Johnny Depp fan or a Dark Shadows fan then this is an excellent movie for you.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was instantly immersed in Hugh Howey's post-apocalyptic tales in this omnibus edition.  I would have been disappointed to read the first installment and not already have the following stories.  I loved the characters and the plot.  I noticed no more errors in editing than any best-selling hard copy novel, so don't be worried about that pet peeve.  I enjoyed this book and will be buying future books from this same author.
B009HV2JT8|3.0|I guess I expected more out of this movie than what it gave. It wasn't bad but it isn't a movie I would add to my collection.
0307596885|5.0|This is vintage Munro, living past my expectations of her! HER SUBLE DEPECTIONS OF ORDINARY LIVES ARE ACTUALLY EXTRAORDINARY!  kUDOS!
B001NLKT60|5.0|Great thriller with some real twists. Thoroughly enjoyed it! Ends sort of abruptly but excellent book in the trilogy. Can't wait to read the next one.
B0012FBZD8|5.0|I thought this movie was very good. I've always thought Nicole Kidman was a good actress but this movie was just great. The plot I found to be very interesting and different from other alien type movies.
B0059XTU22|5.0|Don't listen to the people saying 48 frames per second does not work because they dont know what they are talking about. I went to the midnight showing of The Hobbit : An Unexpected Journey and was mesmerized by the time it was over. Peter Jackson brilliantly directs and brings us back to Middle-Earth as though we had never left. Jackson's choice of 48 frames per second is the right one because the images are very crisp and there is literally no blurring during action scenes at all. Its pretty amazing how sharp the images look. As to those who have read The Hobbit, you already know that you are in for a great movie because so many great parts are in the first third of the book. Jackson's decision to make The Hobbit into three movies was the right one because they are able to stay extremely faithful to the book and add a few things that were a pleasant surprise. The scene when Bilbo and Gollum play a game of riddles is mesmerizing and the best scene in the movie. That scene puts the movie over the top and from that point on, your in for one hell of a ride. Andy Serkis definitely deserves some Oscar recognition for his portrayal of Gollum. The filmmakers use motion capture to capture Serkis' performance and it is a brilliant one. Its time Serkis gets an award and I think the film definitely deserves Oscar recognition in a number of categories including Best Director and Best Picture. Don't miss out on this film, it is an adaptation that all Lord of the Rings fans have been waiting for and will not disappoint.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love how large the whole unit is. So easy to use. I highly recommend this app. No squinting to see numbers or characters either.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Lots of fun so happy I downloaded it. Telling my friends about it and hope they do the same.<br />I give it a 5.
B0062KMDZ2|4.0|Ive started collecting blu ray 3d movies a few months ago when I got my tv, I have avatar,transformers,pirates:stranger tides,Conan,drive angry,my bloody valentine,alice in wonderland, and journey. It ranks 2nd behind avatar and in front of Alice in wonderland. It's not a great movie by any means, but the 3d alone was pretty impressive, definetly worth having in your collection
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I found this book a wonderful view of life.  Not many of us could go through such a voyage.<br /><br />I think anyone who reads a great deal would enjoy this book.
B0060Q962Q|4.0|I don't win this very often but like to play.  I thought it would be good for my grandchildren in a pinch when we are waiting somewhere.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its a fun game that helps pass the time. I do wish it was easier to unlock games because it does get boring playing the same games over again. but its entertaining.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I highly recommend this book if you're tired of sifting thru articles in bodybuilding magazines and picking up random advice from bodybuilding forums looking for solid advice. All you need is this book.  It covers all aspects of the science of bodybuilding from nutrition, supplements and yes, exercises.  The book not only tells you what to do, it also provides the scientific facts that support the recommended approaches.<br /><br />I'll admit, when I first read thru the book, the 2-3 chapters that cover nothing but terminology and definitions kind of threw me off.  I just skipped that part and went straight to the 'good stuff'.  But I found myself referring back to the definitions as I studied the explanations of proper nutrition and exercise technique.  So as far as I'm concerned, all the content is spot on!<br /><br />I have to admit, I've only recently purchased the book and haven't gotten into the exercises yet.  So I can't provide any references as to how effective the routines are.  But it just looks like good old no-nonsense bodybuilding.  I'm optimistic this book will help me reach my goals.<br /><br />Great book, highly recommended!! Go ahead, buy it!!!  You won't be disappointed!!
B008CLI4N4|5.0|About 90'% of my dvd purchases these days are for various seasons of my favorite television programs or popular shows I've heard about but missed.  Some of this is because even with fast forwarding, I hate having programming interrupted with commercials.  But equal in importance is the idea that I love the indulgence of watching four or five episodes in a row.  It allows you to sink into the atmosphere, story and characters of good programming... and Game of Thrones is some of the best I've ever watched.  Not to mention all the fabulous extras... short bios of all the millions of characters, spotlights on scenery and costumes, etc.  Even listening to the commentary can be a trip, some people are quite skilled at saying things that add to one's enjoyment (though there are plenty of folks who sound like complete boobs).  I am anxious to catch season 2 - my interest driven substantially by the last image on the screen from the first season of Denaris (spelling, sorry) standing naked, having survived the fire of her husband's pyre, with three new-born dragons climbing up her body.
B000AM2L1O|5.0|Loved the doll. Just what I expected. My granddaughter will be thrilled when she receives it on Christmas morning. Thanks
B00553U3HM|3.0|not my favourite Follett novel, took me a little while to get into it and care about the characters, and still didn't care for them like i have in his other books.<br />however, still a very interesting and well written story.
B0079R8IYW|4.0|This is what it is. Works, simple, affordable. Worth it. Nice to have the protection and the privacy and the support it offers.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|i cannot say enough about the game of thrones series.<br />this is not my usual reading taste but WOW i was so obsessed.  watching the tv series along the way was great to see the characters come to life but i highly recommend reading the books they are addictive.  plot is amazing, characters are so so good.  have read them all and im still guessing the outcome.  surprises all round.<br />love it.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Story line is simplistic, at best.  Sex is the hook, but can't really carry the book further than the immediate titillation, which unfortunately is all too predictable.  Very forgettable, but I'm sure it sells well.....
B004S9AK3G|4.0|yet again, Follett has succeeded in creating characters that are worthy of love or hate.  i was so heartbroken and frustrated with some of the lives forced on characters, and others i found myself hating so much that i wanted them to die!<br />i was hooked until the end.<br />i am only a recent ken follett fan but have enjoyed 5 of his books in the last 3 months.  love him.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game you CAN find diamonds,gold,iron and much more (for you people who say their isn't caves you can get caves when you create a world go down to world generator seed and type in Horrid Seed to get caves if you can't find monsters go to options and take it off peaceful mode)
B00A77II0U|5.0|Fantastic game for the Kindle Fire! The file is pretty big, but worth it. Just wish it lasted a bit longer. Great hidden object/puzzle game.
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|This is a fun and challenging game.  I hope to see more games like this from them soon. This one is a hit.
030758836X|5.0|Absolutely intriguing book!  Twists and turns galore - couldn't put this one down.  Highly recommend and would like to read other books by this author!
B0091VGAXK|4.0|If you grew up in the 80's you'll likely really like this movie. Fully entertaining for 90 of the 120 minutes - it drags a bit at the end. Overall a fun time.
B002Y27Y42|5.0|Exactly want I wanted, wasn't scratched or anything. Now I can share my Christmas memories for years to come. Very Happy with my purchase
B0050IY61G|4.0|ordered this book as a kindle read.  It is a great book! It is written in laymen terms for easy understanding.  More importantly, I now have a better understanding of this syndrome and how to better respond to certain behaviors associated with the same.  I am not finished reading this book  yet.  It is hard to put down once you start reading it.  If you know someone with this syndrome or just experiencing this type of behavior (and has not been diagnosed) you will certainly learn alot of good information from this book and it will give you confirmation that you may want to seek medical assistance.  highly recommended!
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|My son loves trains and this movie! We watch it all year round. The graphics on the blu ray are amazing I couldn't believe the difference.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I think this is a great game! It is challenging and makes you think. While at the same time keeping your interest. I would not recommend to children under 8 years old.  definatly worth the money.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The end (well the whole book) was great. I hope there is yet another book to come soon!! I can't wait.
B0090XG9T4|5.0|NOTE:  I am comparing the two blu-ray releases.  Both are somewhat better than the DVD, so you should definitely get a blu-ray edition.  I have the first blu-ray release and now the second (2012) blu-ray release, and I compared them last night and the second is no improvement, so save your money.  I'm keeping both because if an atom bomb drops on my collection I hope at least one copy will survive.  I saw Part I (not called that, of course) in the great Ziegfeld Theater, I think it was, in September 1974, a few months after it opened, and have never gotten over the thrill of that movie collection.  The second had a different director and was comparatively poor, but TE III has great stuff, including an unbelievable sequence of how a \\"traveling\\" tap dance number is filmed.  Wow!
B001R10BM8|5.0|very nice blue ray,but should offer guide service number.the product very nice.<br />i recomend seller.and the picture is very rare.

085786078X|5.0|This is the third collection of Simon's cat cartoons.<br />It is just as humorous as the other collections and the videos.
B00002N9ER|2.0|Not much I can say about them.  I was excited to finally have a place for my maglite in my class B RV, but sadly within the first couple of times that I removed the light while at a campsite, one clip broke.  Having said that, I'm here to buy another set since they are inexpensive enough.<br /><br />Update - after a little more searching, I decided not to go with these again.  I'll spend a few more dollars on these: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006NOC8Q6/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?ie=UTF8&smid=A30CMYG2VPLUO6

B00A0R42L6|3.0|Haven't had time or attention to watch it in it's entirety, though the kids have watched it several times and it seems to keep them entertained.
1449417051|5.0|A great offering by the writer from The Oatmeal. It's not even 2013 but I left it on my desk in preparation for the new year. Already numerous co-workers in my office have started reading it and laughing at how funny the drawings are. If you aren't familiar with this humor, check out the website first to see if you'll like this. I guarantee you will!<br /><br />One note, the calendar is much larger than I was expecting. My old calendar was smaller, so I have to make some extra room for this one.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Every episode has me on the edge of my seat.  I am left craving more at the end of every episode.  Who knew that time could pass by so quickly?
B004TI5N38|4.0|for those of you that read lee child and jack reacher, you will see how this is a very good copy of the concept that makes jack reacher.  right down to the head butt....I like both authors, and will continue to read both, and I guess there is always room for another hero in today's world....
B005I3PAUO|4.0|I've not read any David Baldacci books before, and I only started with this one because it sat at the top  of the UK charts with a bunch of good reviews and a 20p price tag - but I'm glad I picked it out, and I'm giving it four stars. It would be three and a half, but that isn't possible.<br /><br />Zero Day is the first in what I'm sure will be a series starring Jack Rea... sorry, not Jack Reacher, John Puller. Spot what Baldacci did there? Many other reviewers have drawn the comparison between Lee Child's Jack Reacher and Baldacci's Puller, and while there are only seven basic plots in story-telling and some overlap is inevitable, I'd still have to say that Baldacci's Reacher is unnecessarily close to Child's Puller. If you see what I mean.<br /><br />The story begins with John Puller being assigned to investigate the murder of an entire family. Puller is Army CID, and he's given the job because the father was in Defence Intelligence. The investigation unwinds slowly, and the book really gets going at about three quarters of the way through when we learn the reason for the murder. It was done to cover up multiple wrong-doings, and part of that is a very nasty terrorist attack that Puller must prevent once he's figured out who the bad guys are.<br /><br />The book's writing style is a curious mix of spare with a tendency to being long-winded. The set pieces are economically described - a little bit too economical for my liking, it's a bit slow in the slow parts, and never really fires up in the action.<br /><br />This is not gritty realism, this is a CSI-style procedural detective story, with thriller action in the end game - also very much like a Jack Reacher book. So if you're one of those people for whom Child's one-a-year output is not enough, then this is right up your street.<br /><br />Despite my reservations about the comparisons, I enjoyed this one and thought it was just about worth the four stars. It stretched my suspension of disbelief too much to standany chance of getting the fifth star, and while I was always engaged with the story, it never came close to rising up and sweeping me away.<br /><br />It was a perfectly good nuts and bolts thriller with, for the most part, tab b very effectively fitted into slot b. If you're looking for paroxysms of excitement or enlightenment, this isn't where you'll find it, but it's a more than pleasant diversion for a winter evening.
B002UXRGM0|5.0|Wow! What a wonderful way to spend an hour?  It's gobsmacking.  Some footage is reused from other productions, but with this high quality, who cares. David Attenborough is totally predictable, but that is half the fun.
1741797802|5.0|the main reason I chose this guide as opposed to the many others...I love the history timeline...so much to learn and know about these beautiful people and this amazing place...just a few pages covers hundreds of years!!!
B0036EH3U2|5.0|I bought this product and I was blown away with how good it looks on my HDTV.  Battlestar Galactica is a very action packed space saga and blu-ray is the way to watch it.
B0089AD8IO|5.0|Doctor Who is an amazing British TV show, and Series One is the perfect place to begin watching.  It took a few episodes before I realized what a great show it is.  At first I thought that it was going to be a cheesy show with cheap special effects, but I quickly reached a point where I couldn't wait for the next episode.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect from this title based on the description, but I was very impressed with the plot and character development. Connelly really makes you feel for his characters, even the bad guys.<br /><br />Great read!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|it is so much fun and and challenging if u want it to be because u can chose the difficulty i decently recamend it
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is really fun to play. its a good time spender for when bored. what I like about it is all the rewards you get.

B000HZD168|3.0|Scientists like to forget that it was Darwin's theory of evolution that led to the scientific racism of the early 20th Century and attendant atrocities, including eugenics and racial/ethnic genocide.<br /><br />In this film it is proposed that Captain Kirk's ex-lover, along with his illegitimate son, have invented a technology with the power to reshape all matter in the universe into something delightful, like a giant Garden of Eden. The germ for this story-line probably began in the imaginative works of slightly off-balance Gene Roddenberry who consulted on this production. I imagine his thinking went something like this:<br /><br />The Big Bang resulted in an orderly universe, so why can't sentient beings someday create  a technology that improves on the Big Bang?<br /><br />If agnostic Roddenberry had taken a few minutes to think things through he might have concluded thus:<br /><br />The Big Bang created a universe so vast, it boggles the mind. Despite all our probing we have yet to detect the slightest clue of life, or even suitable conditions for life anywhere else in the universe. Moreover, what we do know about other planets is they are staggeringly harsh environments; Earth is the only true oasis we know of formed from all the vast matter of the universe. Therefore, if man did someday harness the ability to rearrange matter on a galactic scale what is the probability that said rearrangement would result in anything more than more cold, forbidding, lifeless planets, asteroids, and the like? No, I think a better plot for a film would be for Kirk to take the Enterprise to the farthest reaches of the universe only to discover that Creator God, who fashioned oasis Earth, is near to every man, and every heart, if only they open themselves up to Him. Yes, that is the film I'll make.
1401322786|5.0|Mitch has out done himself again. Had read all previous books and this is right up there! Finished it in 2 days!!!lPleased as punch!
B000SEGUDE|3.0|As you probably have heard by now, the book consists of stories nested within each other and held together by themes and a shout-out to the previous story--a character from the previous story is referred to by a character in the next story.  Each of the stories is different in structure; the first is a journal, the next is told in letters, the third reads like a thriller, the fourth is an interview, and so on.  And each one takes place at a different time starting in the 1850's and extending to dystopian futures. In each era, the weak are enslaved and the violent triumph.  I couldn't really care deeply about any of the characters, but the stories are inventive and interesting enough that I wanted to know what would happen, so I kept reading.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this app. it gets the job done quickly and efficiently. only thing I don't like, is that the screen wont rotate.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|To have all the films (including the ultimately wasted 4th film) on high definition blu-ray was worth the wait. All the films look stellar and the special features are fun. Of course all fans would love for Spielberg to one day record a commentary but we'll take what we can get... and what we get here is worth it. For me, one of the better things is the book art by Drew Struzan accompanying each film's envelope.
B0059XTU1S|5.0|This movie is FREAKING AMAZING!!! I was getting really worried before going to see it because of some negative reviews, but there is nothing to worry about. If you loved the Lord of the Rings movies, especially the extended editions, then you will love The Hobbit too!<br /><br />A little bit about me: I grew up on the animated movies, read the books when I was in sixth grade, and have reread them several times over the years. I'm a HUGE fan, but not a \\"purist\\", and saw each of the live action films several times in the theaters. I took a class on Tolkien in college (and knew more about the books than even the teacher lol), went to view the original manuscripts at Marquette University in Milwaukee twice, and borrowed most of the History of Middle Earth books from the library but just skimmed them. I'm pretty familiar with much of the appendices/deleted chapters/abandoned attempts at revising The Hobbit and sequelizing Lord of the Rings, etc.<br /><br />I've been waiting for The Hobbit since 2003, and have been following the production online. When it was announced 5 months ago that Peter Jackson was splitting the story into 3 films (after already completing production on the 2-film adaptation), my heart sank. It's not that I was opposed to turning The Hobbit into a trilogy (despite that it's meant to be a children's story and not an epic), but I just didn't think there was enough story and it seemed like a cash grab that would probably destroy the pacing. But, Peter Jackson hasn't let me down before and so I held out hope. In fact the more I heard him talk about giving the dwarves a bit more character development and backstory and adding in all the stuff about the White Council, I began to look forward to it.<br /><br />When a couple weeks ago reviews starting coming in saying that, as I had first feared, the movie dragged and the pacing was terrible, I prepared myself for disappointment. Even though hardcore fans on messageboards like theonering.net who had seen themovie early kept saying it was terrific, the negative reviews from professional critics kept coming in. The movie is \\"bloated\\" and \\"dull\\" and \\"misses the point\\", they said. And so I was VERY nervous going to see the movie this afternoon.<br /><br />I'm pleased to say that not only is the movie incredible, but it's on par with the Lord of the Rings movies. I haven't felt this way about a movie since Fellowship of the Ring 10 years ago. I haven't been able to stop thinking about it all night, and I can't wait till I can go see it again. I sat in the theater for nearly three hours with the biggest grin on my face the entire time. The movie didn't feel bloated or stretched thin to me. I was worried that there would be all these scenes that went on too long or belonged on the cutting room floor, but I can't think of anything I would have left out. It was like watching the book acted out on the screen in front of me with really great acting, music, and production values.<br /><br />The cinematography has really improved in the last 10 years! Wow this movie is beautifully shot! Howard Shore's music is once again great, though there are some little deletions and changes from the Original Soundtrack -- the only one that really bugged me though was the use of the Nazgul theme over Thorin fighting Azog. There was better music there in the Original Soundtrack and changing it was a horrible decision.<br /><br />I love the added stuff with the White Council/Necromancer. It's all there in Tolkien's appendices and in \\"Unfinished Tales\\", and (blasphemy for saying so) depending on how this continues to play out over the next two movies I may end up liking this even better than the book! Either the next film or the one after that will have the Battle of Dol Goldur and, from what I've heard, we will see Gandalf, Saruman, Radagast, and Galadriel battling werewolves and giant spiders as they try to drive out the Necromancer. I can just imagine how awesome that will be if Peter Jackson pulls it off!<br /><br />And, yes, this felt to me like a complete movie. One of the reasons I originally hated the idea of a trilogy was I expected to feel short changed by only seeing a small fraction of the story and then having to wait another year. But I felt like there was plenty of story and they got into plenty of adventures.<br /><br />My only nitpicks are few: I liked the design of the Great Goblin but I thought he acted way too cartoony. My other is there were a couple times where Bilbo and the dwarves fell from a height of like 500 feet and just got back up. They would have been killed. I also thought the character Azog was fine, but why did he have to be all CGI? Why couldn't it have been an actor in makeup like Lurtz in Fellowship of the Ring? Those are really my only nitpicks though.<br /><br />As I sat in the theater I had a feeling like this is one of the best filmgoing experiences I've ever had. I had the same feeling watching Lord of the Rings. As someone who originally hated the idea of making this into a trilogy, now I say bring it on!!!<br /><br />UPDATE: I got to see the movie in 48 frames per second (HFR 3D) yesterday. I had only seen it in regular 24fps 3D before. 24fps has been the standard for film since the Silent movie days. The Hobbit is the first movie to be shot at 48fps to give it a sharper look. Unfortunately the technology is new so only a few theaters are equipped to even show it at 48fps. Many of the reviewers were saying they hated it, that it looks like a BBC TV movie. I was still curious to give it a try because it's new technology and it's how Peter Jackson intended you to see the movie, but I didn't want it to distract from my first viewing if I ended up not liking it, so we saw the movie first at 24fps 3D.<br /><br />Anyway, I liked it and I didn't think it looked \\"cheap\\" or like a \\"soap opera\\" at all. It looked really sharp and there were some parts where the people looked like they were really right in front of you. In addition to that, motion blur is completely gone now and I've heard from other people who get headaches from watching 3D movies that they were fine watching this one, thanks to the 48fps.<br /><br />Peter Jackson has confirmed that there WILL be an extended edition dvd/blu ray like they did with the Lord of the Rings movies. So you may want to hold out from buying the theatrical dvd when it comes out and get the extended edition.
0399534601|5.0|This book is fun and it will push you to do things that you have not considered doing, like collecting all sorts of objects and writing about them. I loved it!

1423140605|5.0|The seven Greek and Roman demigods are finally together.  Now they must embark on their quest to close the Doors of Death and stop Gaea from taking over.  Annabeth has also been given a quest by her mother Athena to follow the mark of Athena and avenvege her.  Not to mention Annabeth has just been reuinted with her boyfriend, Percy Jackson, after he lost his memory for a few months.  She doesn't know what to expect and if he has changed at all.  Everyone is feeling the pressure as the seven board the Argo II and set off for Rome.<br /><br />Rick Riordan has once again written a great story.  Not only do we have more of Percy and Annabeth but the newer demigods are just as captivating and entertaining.  This book has everything in it; mythology, drama, suspence, action, romance, comedy and tragedy! The demigods are full of cleverness and witty humor when they are facing their enemies which makes these books so engaging.  Although Percy and his friends are demigods, they all have their flaws that they must deal with which makes them much more interesting and likeable for me.  This book is more focused on Annabeth's journey but everyone makes and appearance and other plotlines continue to evolve.<br /><br />I loved every minute of the book right until the GIANT CLIFFHANGER at the end!!! My only gripe is that I have to wait an entire YEAR to find out what happens next!! If you haven't read the Percy Jackson and the Olympians books or the first two Heros of Olympus books I highly recommend that you do.

B004GJXQ20|5.0|each characters perspective is written with empathy. The descriptive language is not at all repetative and I found myself being able to relate to each character as thiugh i knew them. I can't wait to start the next book.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|I had lost my first movie so I was so happy that amazon was selling.<br />Because I just need to buy it again.
B009CPES4I|4.0|Great actors, great scenery, heartfelt and thoroughly enjoyable story.  The scenery is wonderful and you get a real feel for being in India.  And there's a message too.  All good!
B0087X728K|5.0|I used this to set my CPU after putting an Antec cooler on it. It spread nice and seems to work well very cool temps. I only used the stock compound that came with the CPU fan kits I have ordered in the past. I used it on two older computer CPUs I had in the house and still have a little left over. They all seem to be running cool. I didn't check the temps on them before and then after. I should have for the review. Sorry. Seem like good product and I would buy more of it when needed
B003O86FMW|4.0|Excellent book a very good read, had a hard time putting it down. Can't wait for the movie . Read it!
B007V508CC|5.0|Maroon 5 is one of the rare bands left today where EVERY song is good!  Just when you think the CD couldn't get any better you listen to the last son which is their version of Prince's KISS!  Awesome ...
B009WO7NQO|4.0|It's ok...just don't appreciate that all the games have to be paid for to play them.  If I am going to play a game I bought I don't want to be hit up for money to  play some of them
0316227706|5.0|Kudos to Seth Casteel for such a wonderful book!  Being an avid animal lover, especially dogs, plus a photography fanatic, I couldn't wait to get this book once it hit the shelves in October.  I have since ordered copies of it for family members as well as friends for birthday and holiday gifts.  Hopefully, Seth will do another book very soon!  For any dog lover, this is a must have to add to your collection!
B000OT6UZQ|5.0|This is such an entertaining movie. I don't care what anyone else say, I love it and I will always love it. It's like a classic for me.

1574214276|3.0|I found the process fun for a while but I grew tired of the repetitive nature of the process after doing only a few.
B006CHML4I|5.0|Classic styling, handsome in blue.  Keeps great time.  Not too big on my wrist.  Couldn't be happier.  Love the transparent back.
0525952926|4.0|I enjoy reading Follett.  As is representative in most tomes though, at about page 900, I was ready to finish.  Not because I was enthralled with the events, but because I was simply tired of reading.
0345803485|5.0|love this book it takes you away and makes you feel like its you and it was very good. Great.
B008NMT684|1.0|boring this game is so boring the last time I played it I fell asleep and its to easy that I was doing it in my sleep but its still fun to pop the ballons

B00AMBH70S|5.0|This movie really digs far deeper into the depths of the Bourne program than any of the other films. Much more dialogue and depth in the story, by far the best of the Bourne franchise.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|i love these movies and so do my kids so we watch them as a family for family night and my kids will watch them over and over again
B007WKEM8C|1.0|Why would I pay 18 dollars for a Kindle version of a cookbook when I can get a real printed version for 19! Am I on the Apple website or something???
B0042MEQVG|5.0|i love these movies and so do my kids so we watch them as a family for family night and my kids will watch them over and over again
B006CUDDUG|5.0|Le Carre at the top of his form.  As I read, I felt like I was getting an insider's view into the inner workings of Cold War espionage.  Despite all the wheels within wheels, Le Carre produced a page turner. His complex plot complications are fascinating and keep you reading.  I was blindsided by the ending.
B002CLBJPK|5.0|watched when i was a kid and the kids sat and watch the whole thing so they loved it to
0345525558|4.0|Character development is above par. A unique approach to a novel. Our book club all enjoyed the book and had good discussion.

B005IQZB14|5.0|I am not a hiker but this author puts you right on the trail with the main character in the book.  I look forward to reading more of the book each day.  It came highly recommended by my son and daughter-in-law!
0446579939|5.0|i loved the movie and i loved the book im still reading it cause my kids are always around. But i love the story.
0756407125|5.0|Patrick Rothfuss has created a truly believable alternate world of beauty, mystery, suspense and love. I would put both book one and two in the top ten reads of my life. And at 61 years of age I've read a lot of books.
0425263908|5.0|it was just like fifty shades of grey and I loved it cause i love books that take you away and make you feel like someone else.
B0050R0XEG|5.0|My son is a volkswagon bus (1972) driver and he loves everything to do with the buses. Found this set with the help of one of his friends. This is his Christmas present this year and I know he will just love it. Arrived in no time and looks just like the picture. Cant wait for Christmas now!
B001NLKXK2|5.0|I LOVE this book and cried a few times while reading it! It is the most touching story with the most wonderful character, Alice, who will stay in your heart and mind forever!  I have read everything Lisa Genova has written since and love them all but this is my very favorite!  DON'T miss it!
B00992CF6W|4.0|I only gave this 4 stars because it is missing a lot of stuff. Like redstone and switches and pressure plates and iron doors. Make an update please!
B000FC1LOC|4.0|This was my very first time reading Jodi Picoult years ago.  But have you ever gone to the movies and seen a great film but the ending was bad and it just made you mad!  Well if that is how you feel, you may want to think twice before picking up some of Jodi Picoults books like this one!  If you saw the movie &#34;My Sisters Keeper&#34; I will simply tell you that the ending of the film was different than the ending of this book so be prepared.
0062183591|4.0|As a student enrolled in Carlow University's Masters of Science in Fraud and Forensics [...] course on Forensic Research and Analysis, we are to read Ariely's book: The (Honest) Truth about Dishonesty.  Ariely's approach to conveying his message about how everyone cheats but to what degree is very interesting and captures your attention.  The ways he goes about getting his message clear will keep your attention and will actually shock you in his findings.  After reading this book, I was able to apply his research in both my personal and professional life.  The only flaw I am able to discuss would be his redundant use of his matrix task.  Most all of his discussed experiments were conducted using this matrix.  After reading so many different types of experiments, it would be more interesting if they were conducted differently.  In short, this is a very interesting and easy read by an extremely intelligent writer.
B000OVLINI|5.0|This is the one book that I have begged all of my friends, family and even people I have just met to read!  This is one of the best books that I have ever read and that is saying a lot considering how much I read!  You will love the plot, the characters the mystery, suspense and all the twists and turns!  DO NOT MISS THIS BOOK!

0385512104|4.0|I love books where a child is the narrator and I especially love books where a &#34;special&#34; child is the narrator!  It gives the most wonderful and refreshing perspective!  This is a wonderful book and a quick read!
B003TSEL7S|5.0|The Heroes of Olympus series is set in the world of Percy Jackson and peopled with both familiar and new heroes, here to save the world we know (and also the world of the Greek and Roman gods along with their demigod champions). If you enjoyed the chronicles of Percy Jackson, you will love this series as well!
1416511946|4.0|I have always had a fascination with reading about musicians and I love reading about the few that have actually been in the depths of hell of addiction and been able to find their way out!  This is an amazing story but Nikki doesn't try to glamorize his escapades and he doesn't downplay it either.  He tells it like it is, the pain, not just for yourself but for everyone who knows and loves you.  And he doesn't downplay the recovery either or shove it down your throat, he doesn't live in guilt, or see himself as a super hero, he is just a very lucky man who did what so many others have not been able to do!  Thank you for sharing your story Nikki and may you remain on your new path for the rest of your days!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Out of the three books this one was my favorite because I felt that katniss fought the hardest in this one for someone she loved. Even though she didn't know she loved him yet.
B000NY12CI|3.0|I love this type of book and was excited to read this authors story.  I am not really sure why but I never felt for the author and felt many times that she got lost in details that left me confused or bored.  Seemed to be a lot of complaining and I was left feeling less than impressed or inspired.  If you like this sort of memoir I would recommend &#34;Stolen Lives&#34; or &#34; Left to Tell&#34;.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|not suitable for kids. long story that will keep you entertained! needed to use hints so it is not super easy like some apps.
1849904251|5.0|My 15 year old daughter and I are huge fans of Sherlock so I saw this book and bought her a copy.  This is a great book!  Very funny!  It is written like it is John Watsons scrapbook and there are post it notes throughout from Sherlock and John!  Gives some interesting insights to the episodes!  We love it!
B00913DPW2|4.0|SCARY in the dark room in the basement I saw the zombie or ghost and I had the cross out so I saw him in the chair and tryed tapping on him and that gust made him mad then he sent me to the top of the basement stairs and I do not know if he took my cross or I killed him and didn't need the cross anymore.
B002PEP4HI|4.0|I have read all of Mitch Alboms books but have always loved Tuesdays with Morrie the most.  Well this book brought me back to that maybe because he is back to writting about his real life experiences.  If you are a fan you do not want to miss this book!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is great when you're bored. I play it on the train all the time. Ads aren't so bad only pops up in between finishing and starting games.
B008HK3XOU|4.0|This case meets my needs perfectly.  It protects the kindle, fits into my handbag, and the fact that it stands is a bonus.
B00650SSDU|5.0|I loved this movie! I thought it was extremely funny, one of the best funny movies I've seen in years.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I watch action movies and this is one of the best ever.  Bruce always makes things seem real and the cast is great and fun.  I just wish I could have purchased it for this price!
B009KS4XRO|2.0|don't like the hidden fee. you can only play so long then they spring that you have to pay for chips to continue the game wad great if I didn't have to pay.
B003NFM3JK|5.0|I own about three of the regular Scrooge films but those ones are w regular actors. Itll be nice to add another Scrooge to my Scrooge pile, but a cartoon! Very cool!!!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|don't like however that I have to go in and change to show me recent entries only button every time. I wish it would stay that way.
B000AGTPUU|5.0|For some odd reason, through cable, I keep catching this at the tale end of the film. Ive not seen the whole film and so its only fitting I purchase the movie to FINALLY watch it start to end. So grab me a bowl of popcorn, honey,  Ive gotta date w destiny!!!
B00632HWOG|1.0|I used this app daily on my Kindle Fire. It had a new update today and after it downloaded my inbox won't load and it shuts down my Kindle after a few minutes of trying to load my messages. Completely ruined a good app. Wish I could uninstall the latest update.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Now I'll have to download the final book.  Even though I enjoyed the first two books, I have to agree with some of the reviewers.  It's like they were f@$!king on every other page.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Was a great read!!!  I couln't put it down.  I have already recommended it to others.  Even my grandaughter is anxious to read it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved the book from beginning to the end. Just read it non stop. As always the book was more in depth and better than the movie. I would recommend for teenagers through adults. Didn't really like the idea of children or anybody killing for sport but the book kept my interest and I finished all three parts. I would reread it again.
B004MC8CA2|1.0|I tried to sign up to be able to get more features, but the email conformation link never works! I have re-sent the email to my address numerous times and it hasn't worked! Don't even go through the hassle. Just buy a book version.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Love this app because it gave me information for another state that I was going to visit in a few days. This way I knew how to pack my suitcases. I was also alerted to the possibility of snow. I was able to keep check on the temperature over a longer range than normal. I could keep my own stats on the weather.
B001F6TXME|5.0|I have used this remote cord for a while now, and it has worked like a charm. No delays, works every time I push the button. I had no issues plugging the cord into my camera body, the bulb mode work nicely (you can lock the remote to work in this mode), the cord length is right for me.<br /><br />I´d definitely recommend this product.<br /><br />By the way I´ve used it in my D7000.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved the story line behind the obvious sexual parts in the trilogy. It kept you hooked and concerned for the characters. Wondering what would happen next. I would advise this book for college age and up. Too graphic for the younger set.
0763635383|5.0|Sweet story --Pre-K love it! I am now looking for Owl baby puppets. That would be a great asset to the book!
B0081JPTCQ|5.0|Great app. I can link it to my Dropbox Cloud or my Amazon Cloud. It is very convenient. Love it!
B003NFM3JK|5.0|This is my favorite version of A Christmas Carol. The animation is amazing and Jim Carrey does a great job as a couple of the characters in the movie. This is one movie that will be a Christmas tradition to watch in my home for years to come.
B0009XNUK0|5.0|It's a best of Michael Jackson, what can I say? It's got a lot of great songs and I would recommend it to anyone.
B0096NCVAE|4.0|My wife and I got this for my son to go with the newer Monster Fighters Lord Vampyre's Castle.  It's an excellent addition, and the figures (especially the witch) are great.  It's a little pricey though (as are many Lego items) but worth it if you or your kids are big Halloween or horror fans.
B00475AYJQ|4.0|did not read this book.  It was a book my husband bought for himself.  He stated that he did like it though.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|This is a 100% Cory book. The end was the best since Plum Island.I liked the fact that his wife is with him and she stands out as a capable tough agent, as she should.
B0010SKUYM|4.0|I did not buy this book.  My husband bought it and said that he enjoyed it.  I personally do not read books like this.
B00846REIS|5.0|Great read. I couldn't put it down.  A must read for any one that liked the Fifty Shades series. Can't wait to start the second book.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|This singer is as famous as our beatles in south africa and he lives in detroit , mi now. Everyone should listen to this awesome humble overlooked vocalist.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Using this app for file management on my Kindle Fire is a breeze!  It has good functionality for moving downloads intobtheir right place.  It makes exploring the file structure easy.  It's not an app for everyone, but more for the techies like myself, it is invaluable.
B007SGM084|5.0|I was glad i bought the Kindle triology bundle. I didn't have to wait for the next book and I could keep reading.
B004QL7K70|5.0|I did not think i would like this but it was pretty good. i enjoyed it alot. i usually don't like movies in the form that it was made but they did a pretty good job. i was very entertained. this movie was also pretty funny it's just one of those stupid comedies that is a waste of time but you still enjoy it. this movie was awesome. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I'm a gamer upgrading from the CM Storm Sentinel<br /><br />Video Review: youtube com/watch?v=gLogpP4aaQI&list=UUTjrsQgjZmBzYzWaAh0zI3Q&index=1<br /><br />Pros: Total: ★★★★★ / ★★★★★<br />Main Features:<br />-It's a gaming mouse...high precision, and you can instantly tell. ★★★★★ / ★★★★★<br />(The most precise mouse I've ever used)<br /><br />-8000 DPI, one of the higher DPI mice on the market. ★★★★★ / ★★★★★<br />-Color Customization (only for the logo?) ★★ / ★★★★★<br />-2 Profiles with 4 DPI profiles included in each, making 8 total DPI Profiles AND saved profiles = infinite profiles. ★★★★★ / ★★★★★<br />-Braided Cable (means it'll likely last years...) ★★★★★ / ★★★★★<br />-Feel: Slick and Soft at the same time. (but can be slippery) ★★★ / ★★★★★<br />-Large Weights for a mouse in a custom case + ease of use to insert) ★★★★★ / ★★★★★<br /><br />Design: ★★★★★ / ★★★★★<br />-Quality: Not cheap, looks to be sturdy, and of quality materials. ★★★★★ / ★★★★★<br />-Comfort: It's a rest your hand on top mouse rather than grip. ★★★★★ / ★★★★★<br />-Slick plastic Black shell, making it look clean and modern (but slick = sliding) ★★★ / ★★★★★<br />^ Some people think the shell is down side, I can say for certain, it looks better than other gaming mice, and is not \\"cheap\\" in Quality<br />-Side Buttons (Whoever designed this part needs a pat on the back) ★★★★ / ★★★★★<br />^ The side buttons actually fit your thumb, they are easy and fast to click.<br /><br />Software: ★★★ / ★★★★★<br />(This is likely the MOST important part of the review, infinite profiles)<br />For a gamer you want 8000DPI, but want a sensitivity that matches your setup. (not sure why you would want less...)<br />Ease of Use: A child could understand, but it includes more features than most high end gaming mouse software. ★★★★★ / ★★★★★<br />9 Easy to Change to any key buttons but should say 7: ★★★★ / ★★★★★<br />Combo Keys (1 button can press 2 keys at the same time) ★★★★★ / ★★★★★<br />Pre-Set Shortcuts, for convenience  ★★★★★ / ★★★★★<br />A macro option: ★★ / ★★★★★ (Does not support mouse movement)<br />Media Options: Pause, Play, Stop, Volume Up/Down, Previous, back, mute: ★★★★★ / ★★★★★<br />Saving Profiles....means you can have more than 2 profiles.... ★★★★★ / ★★★★★<br />A restore button allowing you to default your mouse. ★★★★★ / ★★★★★<br />4 Customizable DPI profiles also you may change the X or Y independently. ★ / ★★★★★ (not needed)<br />Easy to switch lights, brightness and breathing speed. ★ / ★★★★★ (would be 5, if there were more than 1 light...)<br />Loading time: ★★★★★ / ★★★★★<br />Updates: Not sure if the software will be updated or if there's auto-updates. It just says to go to the Anker Website for the software.<br /><br />☛ Cons ☚(feedback for Anker to fix asap): *☠*<br />☢ 1) 2 Profiles Seem small even though you can save more, I'd expect around 4 on board. (Remove the DPI profiles)<br />☢ 2) Only the Logo can be custom colored, and your hand covers it.<br />☢ 3) The profile switch is on the bottom of the mouse? odd...<br />☢ 4) The coating, and rubber grip is very slick in my opinion, although the design makes it look high tech, and modern...<br />☢ 5) The front Lights can not be changed. (Hope you like Blue for a scroll wheel, and side lights)<br /><br />Additional Feedback: It would be cool if the mouse made a high tech unique sound when starting up, or when clicking that could but customized. (don't believe it's been done)<br /><br />The macro feature would be nice if it had mouse movement. (AxifeMouse Recorder, simple and easy)<br /><br />The DPI profiles seem pointless, I'd rather have 4 profiles that are shown by the lights on the side, than \\"DPI profiles\\" (Dot per Inch? = 8000 is all I'd ever use)<br /><br />It would be interesting if it were possible to say...mute my headset mic, without muting the actual volume. There's a key on my keyboard that allows me to do this, but it would be a nice feature on a mouse. (gamers are always talking to each other through headsets, it's say muting, and unmuting your mic is pretty important)<br /><br />☑ Price: It's priced at $60, but seems to always been on sale for ~$30-$40? ★★★★★ / ★★★★★<br />What would I pay if the flaws were fixed?<br />....mmm....$60-$80<br /><br />☑ Very nice precision based mouse. Meaning...fast, and precise. The macro keys are additional features for shortcuts, and such for certain games. I'd only advise you think of this mouse as a 4-7 Macro mouse rather than 9. You would never change left or right click... (basically, middle mouse button, and 3 side buttons for most users) and the front and two top buttons are useful for less used macros. (honestly I like to keep one of the buttons for DPI profile switching because it constantly changes back to DPI profile 2, meaning only half the lights appear)<br /><br />★ AMAZING Mouse for the quality, and price. I'd advise anyone to buy one now, and outdated Razer's off the market. If you want something a bit more superior, and bit more known, I'd suggest a $60 CM Storm Sentinel 2, if you want something with more macros there's those weird 12 keypad mouse. This is about precision, and precision is key. :)<br /><br />Post Review: It's been Over 2 months now, and I've been using this mouse solely for the last....2 months. I love it. :) The initial flaws I saw were quickly changes as my hands adapted to the design. Only issues I have is the lack of color changing lights, and the scroll wheel \\"squeeks\\" like a mouse if I asset pressure a certain way. (just a little irritating). Anyway, I'm at 8000DPI, very high sensitivity across 5760x1080 display, and own over 400 PC games via Steam, and have loved this mouse for every one so far. (I also enjoy playing with a Razer Onza 360 Controller when available)
B005LAIGN2|5.0|red tails is about the tuskegee airforce men who were not able to fly because they were black. they got an opratunity to show themselves what they were made by protecting bomber planes. this movie is based on true events. this movie is awesome. i really enjoy movies based on true events and the acting in this movie was fantastic cuba and terrence are wonderful actors. this is a good flick if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am totally addicted to pinterest and love having this app so I can pin wherever I am. This is a must have app!
B004LWZWGK|5.0|All hyperbole to the side, 'The Dark Knight Rises' is more than just a fitting conclusion to an amazing trilogy, but a great film in its own right.  Without spoiling anything, simply put, if I hadn't seen 'Batman Begins' or 'The Dark Knight' before seeing this one, I would have gone out and bought them immediately.  If I wasn't a Batman fan before seeing this one, I would be afterwards.  And as a fan of Batman, and film in general, it IS a great way to send the story out.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I am not even half way through it a and I wish that it would never end. amazing story that shows what war could really be like.
B000008LOV|5.0|don't leave home with out it great on the road CD great music and soft on the ears as well.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|this app is not good at all. and as I am reading this I see that I am not the only one that thinks so either. I am really hoping that it gets resolved soon. thank you.
B0096PAA6E|5.0|I like this album because I love Jimi Hendrix music and in this musician I can see the possibility of the continuation of Jimi's work This musician is more refined than Jimi and I can really see this guy going places if he doesn't lose his head good work On this album Gary. Looking forward to your next album.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|works like a charm! would recommend it to everyone. shows real time weather for my area and I do not have to search for it at all.
B0016OMFO8|5.0|I have VOL 1  and vol 3 and am wondering is there a volume 2 as I would love one as well.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Battery HD Pro is a must have app for maintaining and monitoring the battery in the Fire HD. I use the app on both the 7 and 8.9 versions and wouldn't be without it.
B00009P1O0|4.0|This is your typical neil Young album its sorta funny in the 70's Neil Young was one of the most confident and sure of himself artist did many albums along beach and cool 70's and 80's themes and then I read on one of his later albums that he was not sure who he was with his music well neil even your bad albums were great, I think it is impossible to buy a bad neil young album. OH if you are wondering that mudguard sticking out of the sand is an old classic bicycle sorts of like a pedal car but its a pedal bike.
1451695195|5.0|This book was truly heartfelt and moving.  It doesn't set out to prove anything or answer a bunch of skeptical questions.  It simply reads as though the author is so excited to share with the world what he learned from the other side.  I found it to be well written and the alternating chapters between what he was experiencing in the coma and what was going on in the hospital room made it easy to read and kept my curiosity peaked.  I definitely recommend it!
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Best Album to have in your collection especially when you want an album that will please everyone and get them in the mood.
1451627289|5.0|If you love time-travel and history, you will LOVE this book.  It's an easy read and I could not put it down. The main character goes back to 1950-60's and I love how King describes the culture, food, cars, people - everybody smokes - everything is inexpensive. Then I learned more about Oswald and history. There's adventure, murder, and romance. It's a keeper cuz I will read it again.
B0009MAP90|3.0|I believe its Dylan first album and it is very good listening for a young bloke I enjoyed it but its not my favourite Dylan album.
B000SW16M6|5.0|This is a coming of age movie done tastefully (if I remember it correctly).  What's not to like about that Tom Cruise smile? or Rebecca De Mornay?
B000002ITW|5.0|Best album they ever put out hadn't heard it for years then a friend gave me the LP and i tracked down this CD as its such a good album.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|I was really looking for subway surfer but sadly the kindle doesn't have it.. I found this game instead nd it actually is pretty good.!
B002KREVE2|5.0|My Mrs likes it as well except for when Leonard speaks about Nancy that killed herself on the site of the concert some time before my Mother Inlaws name was Nancy and she killed herself as well when you consider this background the album must be good for us to still play it and enjoy it.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|persona 4 for the ps2 was great but this game is so awesome. this game is more challenging than the ps2 version as there is more stuff to do and no more time to do it
B0000067L3|1.0|total waste of money only purchased because a friend said it was a good album but it is crap all their other albums are great and worth purchasing I think there were a couple of songs that were good. OK white room is a great song but the price of this album doesn't justify purchasing this and i grew up in this era.

B000QXDED6|1.0|300 tells you a little about Spartans and how they are selected and trained as warriors. King Leonidas takes 300 of the best warriors to fight the Persians supposedly against the wishes of the Oracle.<br /><br />There is no character arc and little story at all. It's war with lots of visual and sound effects of slicing, dicing, and blood splatter. There were some scenes that I found disturbingly weird like the Persian king's harem tent.<br /><br />If you're into movies for effects, you might like it. If you like movies for the characters and storyline, you probably won't.
B009HXG9UQ|5.0|One of my favorite movies of all time.  I love Wes Anderson.  If you liked Royal Tennanbaums you will love this.  If you haven't seen that one get it too.  Lovely love story, very unusual in a charming way.  Most will love it if not all.  Great retro 60s setting.  For those who don't like it, meh, there is always a grinch in the crowd.
0393338398|5.0|\\"Moneyball\\" is a facinating look into the life of one of the game's most brilliant (and volatile) general managers, Billy Beane.  The author basically goes into detail on how Billy's mind works and how he was able to assemble one of the winningest teams in baseball history - with one of the lowest payrolls in all of baseball.  The most important thing I learned from the book is that in order to be successful in leadership, you need to have the perfect balance of wisdom, passion and experience.  There are several Beane wannabes in the world of baseball (I'm thinking specifically of Dan O'Dowd of the Colorado Rockies) who can copy the wisdom by using sabermetrics, but fail miserably at their jobs because they lack the passion for the game and have never been a player.  Beane has it all.  A great book that teaches how to beat bigger and richer competition.  My only warning would be that it may be a little too \\"inside baseball\\" for the casual reader...but a must read for baseball fanatics.

0553386794|5.0|I do not typically read fantasy, but this book came so highly recommended and the HBO Series is a hit, so I thought that I would give it a chance. Wow. Loved it. This book is far too epic to go into detail. There are so many characters and so much happening, that this book really demands to be read as quickly as possible, ie- don't set it down for a month and try to pick up where you left off!<br /><br />The book alternated between being a good drama, a heavy fantasy and is even a bit of a soap opera. It never failed to keep my interest. This is not a book for the easily offended. It is ladden with graphic violence and sex. Loads of it.<br /><br />If anything, the one negative for me, was the use of what I consider \\"fantasy terminology.\\" I am not a fantasy reader and a lot of the quirky names drove me nuts. They sounded silly to me. Sci-Fi often does this too and I find it off-putting. It's like it's misplaced creativity. However, it's easy to let that go, as the book is so good! I can't wait to read the next in the series and won't, because I don't want to forget any of the massive plot points or characters!<br />[...]

0307592731|5.0|Cheryl Strayed's memoir Wild is exactly the type of book that appeals to me. I love stories of people setting off on adventures and I also feel connected to stories of grief and attempts to find a place in the world.    After her mother's death, Strayed found herself in her early twenties and falling apart. Her once close-knit family took an isolationist approach to grief and grew distant. Strayed dropped out of college just shy of graduation, cheated on her husband and turned to heroin. She found a guide-book to backpacking the Pacific Crest Trail, a trail that stretches from Mexico to Canada and although inexperienced, decided to give it a shot.    Strayed saved money from waitressing jobs, bought what she thought was proper gear and planned ahead, parceling out money and supplies sent ahead to post offices along the route. She decided to spend a few months along the trail from Death Valley, California to Portland Oregon. Strayed soon learned all of the book information and hiking tips from REI, did not adequately prepare her for this journey.    The brilliance in this memoir is Strayed ability to write about her life in a way that is so relatable. She exposes herself, warts and all, and her vulnerability makes her so likeable. It made me root for her to succeed on her journey, even though she has made some monumental mistakes in her life. She doesn't gloss over the spousal cheating and drug use. She doesn't make excuses or ask the reader to forgive her. She just exposes herself and it makes the reader accept her past, but love her for the person that she will become, as we get to be part of watching the transformation.    This book is exciting. It's filled with plenty of action and tense moments, as the trail is a harsh place and Strayed is definitely unprepared. Besides Strayed's story, the book is interesting because it exposes a subset of society, those who backpack on these trails. It's a culture and it's fascinating. Strayed makes plenty of friends on her adventure and each has an interesting story of why they are on the PCT. The PCT is its own character that's constantly changing and filled with surprises.    Strayed's memoir is rooted in grief and is very healing. It made me cry, in several places. I had been reading it during my lunch breaks at work, but found it to be so emotional, that I finished it in the privacy of my home. The emotional passages hit me like a ton of bricks and were hard to predict where they would fall in the book. They are profound and sprinkled throughout. Strayed is very self-aware and has a knack for keen observations often leading to profound statements.    This book is a must read.    Please check out my [...] for more reviews and life adventures!

6305128952|3.0|This DVD seems very grainy & dark compared to the first dvd I had of this movie.  Additionally, there are parts in this dvd that are missing, such as when the daughter is watering the stock in the montana barn, she goes into pilgrims stall, he paws a bit then comes up to her and nuzzles her.  This scene is cut short and you never see the nuzzle.<br /><br />Now as far as content, Monte Roberts will be the first to tell you that each horse is different and needs to be handled according to the horses feel and sometimes that feel will dictate that certain methods must be used to get across the full intent of what you want him to do, to include ropes, etc.  Even Roberts will tell you also that he doesn't know it all and will always be the continual student of the horse.  anyone that thinks they do know it all... well... enough said.

B001OQCV6A|5.0|To begin with, Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law give brilliant performances. The scenery is fantastic. The story is clever, intelligent, and full of wonderful twists and turns. The soundtrack, too, has made it into my collection. I adore the subtle humor in the tale, and the way the music so perfectly works with the scenes. The slow motion fights are probably the best I've ever seen. I am picky about what movies I buy, but this one was an instant, easy choice.

B009M1QRM8|5.0|... the winners are - obviously: The readers!<br /><br />The story starts at an hefty pace where Cold Vengeance left the readers breathless: With the bloody abduction of Helen, Agent Pendergast's wife. Who was ufficially murdered by a lion 12 years ago... So everyone - me included - was waiting what would follow after this oh so well constructed cliffhanger!<br /><br />As I said before, the pace ist set: It will be a race against the time...<br />Pendergast - almost all on his own - has to dig deep into his bag of tricks.<br />And all this to the whole benefit of the readers who follow his tour de force more than one time choking for air! Action time at its best, until the very end - the very tragic outcome in the desert of Sonora, Mexico. A sinister punch right below the waistline of our good Agent!<br />And a grave will be dug...<br /><br />Then Pendergast gets lost - for himself, his friends like Vince d'Agosta, Laura Hathaway, Miss Kyoko, Corrie Swanson, Lady Viola from Italy...<br />And thinks heavily about the sense of his further stay in this earthly hell.<br />He looses totally his prospective validation of the future.<br />Until - yes until Vince D'agosta faces the genial (Ex?-) Agent with a new \\"player in town\\" - a serial killer of the worst kind. Of that I-am-invincible styling.<br />Working out on his victims and leaving apperently withour any shame literally bits and pieces and prints and comments behind.<br />As if to use the old Ripper word: Catch me if You can!<br /><br />But the plot is much more intricated than it yet seems. Connie Swanson pestered a very wasp's nest, disturbing the covenant - Den Bund, a obviously neo (?) nazistic movement operating right on American grounds. Followed and desperate she goes into hiding, only to find herself with the obligation to help a person for a long time estranged to her. Only to expose herself to much more sinister dangers ...<br /><br />On another level Dr Felder, the psychatrist is heavily obsessed to solve all the mysteries that surround the ancestry and life of Constance. He is also going to dig deep into the history of a mediocre painter who has obviously made paintings of a very young child resembling amazingly to our Constance. And is willing to pay dearly for informations he is trying to get from an apparently old spinster.<br />But it will be Constance at last to finally reveal her past to us all...<br /><br />The killer hunt - fired up by his late wife's greatest secret - takes our hero Pendergast into the jungles of Brazil where - beneath other nationalities - also the Germans have large settlements, one of them called Nova God&ograve;i. From the near town of Alsdorf on the Rio Itajai-Açu, where he seeks an ally in local Colonel Souza, our man Aloysius ventures himself into an adventurous place where \\"everybody sees Nazis\\". And once angain he dips deep into his basket full of his own magic to clear some of the fog that wafts over a mysterious lake.<br />And will find one of the worst experiments with gene tecnology humanity has ever brooded on for at least three generations from the concentration camps of World War II in to the deep rain forests of Brazil.<br />And it has come the time for the so-called \\"roll-out\\" - whatever that will be...

B00846REIS|5.0|i started off reading 50 shades of grey and wanted more of that same type of book. I had saw someone say Bared to you was better. So i thought why not and downloaded it. Although the beginning was a little slow, it did pick up and was a great book to read. I found myself lost in the book and not wanting to put it down. It's a great read.

B009A9BF5G|2.0|First off, congrats to Jim Parsons the producer and Paul Dugdale the director for making one of the best bands in the world look and sound awful! This a master piece of how not to make a music video. Looks to me like Coldplay tried to make their version of U2's Rattle and Hum but forgot that picture and sound were important. The video is awful (there's that word again) and the sound washes out Chris Martin's vocals.... I could hardly wait for it to end it was so bad. And the endless 2 second video cuts are enough to make anyone want to turn off the DVD.<br /><br />Coldplay, you owe me my money back on this one. U2 would never put out such a product.... even 20 years ago.

B009FB3XTA|5.0|This is a great CD and I'm really enjoying it. The songs are very original and go well with the movie.
B000X2H8G4|4.0|It really does work well, but it picks up any noise near it. If you are alone watching TV it would be great, though there is naturally some static sound, but tolerable. As long as you realize anyone or anything making noise in the room will also be heard, and loudest if the sounds are between the device and the TV. If there's a fan on you'll hear that, or the air it stirs up will add to the static a bit. I tried using it while visiting my daughter; she was on the sofa with me and the TV was turned down very low. I could definitely hear the show only while using this, but when my daughter talked her voice was loud. If anything bangs into this it amplifies that sound, too, so you'd want to set it somewhere and not touch it. Again, if you're alone and want to hear it's great; and it does amplify voices! For the price it's a bargain. I'd like to use it with more discrete earbuds (like those with an iPod)  if I were using it in public.

B001BC2ZS6|5.0|John Steinbeck wrote a great book! John Steinbeck wrote, Of Mice and Men.There were these two hard working farmers at a ranch in California. George was a medium built guy that was trying to make a living by barely making any money. George also had to support his friend, Lennie. Lennie was a very tall man, and bucked barley all by himself. Lennie had a mental disorder, and was always getting bullied around. George and Lennie's dream was to own an acre of land, and make a better living. George and Lennie used to work at a ranch in Weed before Lennie started to cause some problems. Which they later had to move to a farm land in Soledad, California. All the workers in Soledad weren't married. Candy the old man, has only one arm and has been working there for a while. Candy doesn't paid much. Candy helps George and Lennie out by giving them his entire life savings, and he would also join them in the land. Crooks the black stable hand, he had different cabin to himself since the color of his skin. Crooks told Lennie that he won't own any land because a lot of people have those big dreams, and their dreams would fail. Slim is the mule driver, and everyone would go to him for any advice. He was known as the \\"peacemaker.\\" Curley was the boss's son; he always wanted to start a fight with Lennie because he likes fighting tall men. One of Curely's hands is full of vaseline with a glove on it to keep his hand soft. He is married to a young girl. He doesn't even give any attention to her. Curley's wife flirts with all the workers on the ranch, and the workers try to ignore her, so Curley doesn't get jealous. George told Lennie to always stay away from her, but one day Lennie does the wrong thing making George and Lennie's dream to owning a land a very slim chance. I think Steinbeck should have developed his characters with more details. The plot line had a lot of suspense. Each time the chains were clinging there was something good going to happen, or something bad going to happen. The book has a lot of suspense making the reader want to read more. I enjoyed reading this book because from the beginning the story had a lot of suspense. There wasn't one part in the book where I thought that this was boring. The book always had me on the edge of my seat! I like reading suspense and mystery books. I wasn't expecting the book the to end like the way it did. I recommend this book to anyone that enjoys reading suspense or mystery books. The book has a lot of racial slurs and profanity. I give this a book a 5/5!
B006RUJST6|5.0|I love this book.  I could not put it down and I found myself laughing (and crying) out loud at times.  The book is great and the sequel is just as good.  However, this book is not appropriate for I would say kids under 13.  Some of the topics are more for young adults and mature readers.  But this book was still very good and is one of my favorites!

B005LAIGRS|4.0|Instead of a dog fight in a small closed area that I expected from the title \\"Safe House\\", the movie gave me over an hour of high octane high quality gun fight and car chase scenes that reminded me of the Bourne Triology (I still hadnt seen the fourth one). Denzel was as smart and cool as usual. Ryan just gave a superb performance that you would wonder whether he's the same one you saw before. The plot was so so but the script was excellent. Highly entertaining which is great after a day's hard work. In short, recommended!
B003D0ZNWY|4.0|I am about half way through the collection.  Wonderful performances by some of the music world's most beloved artists.  The performance info embedded on disc #2 is incorrect but the CD sleeve lists it correctly.  There is a pamphlet with performance and artist listings and a brief essay on the life and times of Mahler but otherwise not a lot of extra info on the pieces.  Includes 16 discs in cardboard sleeves with the same cover picture on each.  Still, a great value to have all this in one place.
B00992CF6W|5.0|my friend has the x-box version and I have been waiting but why no flint and steel in creative?<br />other than that I love it. Any one who is going to get this try nyan for creative but survival is hard to much shade.<br />this is from a 10 year old boy

B0087EVHTE|5.0|Update: It's been 1 month and a half, the processor is performing FLAWLESSLY, temps were still a a little high when playing (70C on the cores, 80 when doing the Aida64 stress test to the CPU and FPU) but i finally decided to change the stock cooler for a Cooler Master hyper 212+ and now, temps don't even get to 55C when playing Battlefield 3, GTA IV, Assassin's creed Revelations, emulating PS2 or Gamecube. Also, they don't pass 60C when doing the Aida64 stress test. Now i can finally get peace of mind knowing that temps won't suddenly skyrocket because the stock cooler couldn't take it anymore.<br /><br />All i can say is i'm really, really impressed with this processor. I was obviously going to see a MAJOR improvement over my old 1st gen core i3, but was a little skeptic on wether it would be enought for my needs.<br /><br />I bought this processor mainly for gaming and emulation purposes. I have to say it, this processor is a BEAST. Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty on PCSX2 was very slow when i played it with my Core i3, but with this processor it goes as smooth as it can be (some slowdowns in some parts, but that's because of the emulator, not the processor's fault), I've seen improvements on games like Assassin's creed 2 (40fps tops before with my HD 6870 and some settings set to medium-low, 60 fps constant now with the new i5, same graphics card and all settings on max.), Battlefield 3, Minecraft (kind of a processor hog), Sims 3, Prototype 1 & 2, etc. Pretty much every game.<br /><br />Temps are a little high on the cores when under load with stock cooler: 70C when gaming and 80C when doing a stress test with Aida64 (Don't wanna try Prime95 or intel burn test with stock cooler). But i' just waiting for my mx-4 thermal paste to arrive so i can go buy a cooler master v8 cooler to do the job. I expecto temps to go as high as 50-60C under load with that.<br /><br />For normal use, it works just as well, no slowdowns, everythings goes smooth.<br /><br />To makeit short, i definitely recommend this processor if you don't plan on overcloking, like me.
B006O6EOII|5.0|I love Zombies so of course of love Ghoulia! I love her style and she's funny, although she doesn't say much! I wanted to see a Ghouls Rule Ghoulia too! This Ghoulia looks fun and im hoping I see more of Ghoulia in the Roller maze game I got my daughter for Xmas!!
1609611543|5.0|I've started paying attention to diet more and more in the last few months and have read many things.  My main impression is that the modern diet is a minefield.  This author implicates wheat as the primary culprit and explains why it causes problems in minute detail, but he is not afraid to go beyond that and that's a very good thing.  Those looking for a quick fix fad diet, well that is a bad habit.  Diet is very complex, the ways in which the modern diet is poor is very complex and hence the solution is complex.  No doubt this book does not identify every problem.<br /><br />So the book is not just zero wheat.  By the end of it, the author is proposing you eat a lot of green vegetables, enjoy plenty of protein and fat from animal sources, avoid excessive portions of any simple carbs to avoid dangerous blood sugar oscillations, avoid the worst oils (polyunsaturated vegetable oils) and avoid overcooking food which releases harmful compounds. He recognizes the benefit of Omega 3's to combat Omega 6's but further explains that the ideal situation is to avoid excessive Omega 6 intake in the first place as excess Omega 3's aren't great either.  The author is a proponent of coconut oil (read The Coconut Oil Miracle and others), recommends avoiding excessive milk due to blood sugar spikes (and perhaps the casein protein), but not cheese (since the harmful parts of milk are removed in cheese making).  Each \\"fad diet\\" may have some part of the truth but Dr. Davis goes a long way to putting much of it together in one place with careful explanations to support his views.<br /><br />One thing that is possibly missing is a warning about foods that are high in histamine.  While most of the author's ideal diet incidentally avoids foods high in histamine, there are a few very high histamine foods still present which may cause inflammation in those who are sensitive.  In particular, the author seems to recommend eating however much cheese you like, but very strong, aged cheeses contain very high histamine due to the fermentation process.  For those who are only slightly histamine sensitive, avoiding very strong cheese may be all that's needed to perfect the author's diet.  For those who are very histamine sensitive, it may be necessary to further avoid avocado, tomato, red wine (go with white wine if you must drink), vinegar and a few more things that the author supports.<br /><br />The ideal diet now becomes yet more difficult... but perhaps that is unavoidable. Our modern diets are far removed from what people ate during most of our evolutionary history so putting the pieces back together requires expensive foods and a lot of knowledge and effort.  Exactly how different our diet should be from the norm and why is a work in progress still, but this book goes a long way to helping by explaining many parts of the problem in detail.<br /><br />A note on weight loss.  I think the doctor goes too far in suggesting that simply getting off the wheat will cause you to lose a lot of weight.  It's very easy to eat more calories than you need, even without wheat. Especially if you make no effort to greatly reduce other carb consumption (rice, corn, beans, sugary fruits/drinks and so on).  If you follow the doctor's diet to the T you will probably lose weight effortlessly.  If you are still getting too many carbs, you will still have to watch your total calorie intake.  At least hunger pangs are weaker and less frequent without wheat however.<br /><br />For a good primer on the problems caused by wheat, look up the article \\"The Dark Side of Wheat\\" which is free on the net.  Read that article and the follow up (linked at the top of the article) on Green Med, then pick up this book for more info.  If you have trouble with the science, read it again.  It's worth understanding the arguments explaining exactly what the problem is.  Finally, don't fall into the trap of thinking the author's information is all or nothing.  He may be missing parts of the puzzle or have gotten some small details wrong.  Always be on the lookout for more information and be ready to put the pieces together yourself.
B0095T3H2U|1.0|Don't bother with this lethargic, uninspiring, and overwrought \\"romantic-comedy.\\" This film isn't romantic; the characters are the opposite of endearing, they are down-right odious. If you go against this warning and waste your time with this film, you'll find yourself screaming \\"Just get married already.\\" You may know people like these ficticious losers in real life, in fact, right now as your read this, he or she may be reading this review and sitting in your chair. Even if you identify with the subject matter, this pathetic scenario is not good fodder for a film, which, by definition, is for entertainment.<br /><br />PS: There are funny gags in the movie (they are few and far between), but you're better off going on YouTube and watching Eddie Murphy, Katt Williams, Russell Peters, Lisa Lampanelli, or George Carlin FOR FREE.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|i absolutely LOVE this series.. Each episode is better than the one before and the one before is always frigg'n awesome.. I love this series.

B009VL28W2|3.0|I guess those days are over for Metallica. There is nothing more exciting at a rock show that those attention getting, thunderous booms that shake the concrete at an arena show. It seems that only Motley Crue and KISS are the only 2 bands worthy of note left, that understand this. It was a great show, I probably would not have bought it if i knew that they wussed out on the pyros again.
B003B02O14|1.0|This is a horrible book.<br />I have read every previous Grisham book and enjoyed them thoroughly.<br />This book does not have one likable character.<br />The protagonist is totally dislikable.  He is a thief and with the help of his despicable lawyer and friend (who happens to be the judge assigned to the case) blackmails the federal government, state government, insurance companies and every other opponent.<br />Using pictures of torture burns he can get whatever he wants.<br />Totally unbelievable.<br />Couldn't wait for the book to end.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I very much enjoyed this game. For me the pace of the game was perfect. It was long, but it didn't drag on. I would say this game is definately worth the money.
0446580848|2.0|An interesting premise, but could have been much better.  Unfortunately, Mr. Demille exhausts the reader with Corey's constant and not that funny mental commentary.  There are a few good cracks that make one chuckle, but most of it just gets in the way of the story.  Mr. Demille also does nothing to develop the character of Corey's talented wife--a missed opportunity to add depth to the novel.  On the positive, the vivid descriptions of Yemen are engaging and interesting, and compliment the story line.

B0017O1MIM|5.0|This blu ray gift set is, simply put,a pleasure experience all the way. From getting your jaw drop when you see the size of the thing, through opening the most pleaseant slip case box, taking the coffe table book in your hands, and finally watching to one of the most meticulously restored version of a classic film ever.<br />If you intend to give one to somebody as a Christmas gift, be sure that the person who receives will probably put you in his (or her) heart in a very sacred placed, apart from considering you a person with a high good taste too !

B009JBWOU0|5.0|The complete Christopher Nolan BATMAN TRILOGY on individual DVD disks along with a really well prepared booklet.  Products like this are hard to find.
0812984412|5.0|This novel powerfully affected me, putting me in a state that I still feel a few days after finishing.  The cumulative effect of the novel's interlinked stories is powerful, but the structure is only as important as the theme, which is the problem of developing a moral sensibility.  Why develop one?  Why consider human relations from any point of view other than materialism or utilitarianism?  This novel considers these questions so deeply and yet so entertainingly that you may find yourself spending all your free moments reading it. You will be well rewarded.  I'm awfully glad I read it.
0007367481|5.0|Masterful! Dr.Mukherjee is like a master guide taking us on a flight high in the sky. He shows the vast expanse of the cancer empire in its entirely in one magnificent view. You see the river of cancer-knowledge from its origins and through the mountains of early challenges, it wandering in loops and curves over centuries making little headway, tributaries from unanticipated sources and its dead ends. He swoops down like an eagle every time a discovery cuts through a seemingly insurmountable mountain or an invention creates the tools for a watershed.  This is the journey through a landscape that people have presumed to be plain and barren, but made fabulously exciting because Dr.Mukherjee has traversed this land so thoroughly before to select for us the truly spectacular views of the turns and waterfalls that have mattered most. Along the way, he introduces to us the medical sailors, who cut the way forward or at least always assumed, forward. We have heard of some before, others not, whose courage and sacrifices are par any and have saved many thus far, the likes of which still keep the river flowing and our hopes alive.
0743454537|3.0|I began reading this book as part of an online book club.  I have heard people go on and on about how good it is.  Well it was pretty interesting for a while.  What MOTHER in her right mind would have a child to pretty much donate to science for the welfare of her older child!  No child should have to endure surgeries and testing like that.  The book was pretty hard for me to get through but the only reason I finished it was to see the outcome of the trial...which was a no brainer.  You know whats going to happen, its completely predictable. SPOILER ALERT...then to end the book with a fatal car crash..REALLY?!?!  I was beyond mad that I read the whole book just for the main character to die at the end.
B005VPRETE|5.0|great gifts for a kid who likes to use their mind and hands.  great value for such a cool living style
0316044938|4.0|I started reading this book because I had seen previews for the movie and it looked like a good story.  I always like to read the books before I watch the movie...it just hits close to home because I had just lost my father.  I could not put this book down.  i would def recommend this book.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|If you've read the first two books or seen the first two seasons of the HBO show, you won't be disappointed.

B0064NTZJO|5.0|It is a great movie.  The blu-ray looks incredible.  Make sure to get the soundtrack as well, it's very worth it.
B001ER4CTI|5.0|el libreto que contiene algunas ilustracione de la pelicula me a gustado , la caja esta muy bien , pero tenia que ser de otra forma , se rompe facilmente si no lo guardas en un sitio que no se pueda , hablando de los tres DVD excelente , lo que me agustado que uno de los DVD  contiene como se rodo la peliculas ,los efectos especiales y los dibujos y su creador magnificos.
B003F3NEBG|5.0|This a top-notch blu-ray transfer of Pride and Prejudice.  I had only seen low quality TV versions before this and the difference is black and white.  So much of the set and costume design really adds to the subtext of the story and you can see it in all its glory now.  The story is well known and this version is already considered the standard-bearer in execution.  Now its in blu-ray and theres no reason not to own it.
B004EPZ0BG|5.0|Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis take on the risque sex scenes and add a punch of one-liners to make this a really funny movie to watch. Woody Harrelson shines as gay sports editor for GQ magazine that Timberlake heads. Truly a hilarious movie to watch.
B00061I0LO|5.0|This is a truly great album.  All of the songs are somehow sincere and darkly ironic at the same time.  Incredible.
B0036TGSIK|5.0|Emma Stone and the entire cast is so funny that this movie is well worth the money you'll spend on it.
B0088RQ4TI|1.0|This movie is poor.  Thats all there is to it.  Maybe kids who just like cool stuff to look at will be entertained but the story is non-sensical and you will not care about the characters.

B009JBWOU0|5.0|I got this trilogy set and it is awesome! A lifelong fan of Batman and superheroes, I've seen just about all of my favorites done justice in live action movies. This trilogy hit the peak. Loved each film. I know there are haters out there, people who have some sort of loyalty to Marvel or DC, and simply those who just don't like superheroes. I don't care. I love it; I like Marvel and DC. Like I said though, I think I've reached a peak. I've seen about all I NEED to see(accept a great Superman movie in this modern age. Perhaps Man of Steel will get it right). All in all, I'm satisfied. I'm sure Hollywood will churn out more and more of these movies, and I'm sure we'll get some more good ones, but for me, I'll never have that high level of anticipation as I've had up to The Dark Knight Rises. Batman is my all time favorite hero. And now I have the ultimate trilogy. I just add that to Batman 1989, Spiderman 1 & 2, X2, Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Captain America, Thor, X-Men First Class and The Avengers to just about complete my great superhero movie collection. Nolan has fulfilled my dreams. Great director IMHO. Long live The Dark Knight Trilogy.
1451695195|4.0|I thought the book was most convincing, covering many aspects of coma and serious illness. I couldn't see the part on hell with gnarled trees as advertised, so I thought that aspect a little incomplete.

B00328G4V6|3.0|I put off buying this album until now because I knew the outcome. It's just as mediocre as Jimi's posthumous \\"Blues\\" album.
0545265355|5.0|I had never read or even heard of the hunger games until seeing the movie. Immediately after watching the movie I had to know what happens and ordered this trilogy boxed set. Great looking books. The writing is superb, the story is great. The characters are developed in a way that you feel as if you know them yourself.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The book(s) were incredible. The story grabbed me and I couldn't stop reading, even when my wife yelled at me! I got little sleep for 2 of the nights and still couldn't resist. The characters are believable, the plot was plausible, the story line was solid and it was an all around fantastic read. I won't put any spoilers in but I can't wait to see what happens in future books.
0307346617|5.0|Arguably the one book that got a whole genre fired back up. It's one of those books that you just don't want to stop reading because you have to know what happens next.
1574216988|1.0|I was deeply disappointed there was very little information that could not be found on a news letter. I do not recommend it.
B000JMLFLW|4.0|I went into this very guarded based off of what I heard. I was pleasantly surprised and would suggest anyone that might be a little weary about reading it to give it a try.
B0096PAA6E|5.0|Gary Clark Jr has really shown his vast talents and strength for a young performer. For a freshman album, it is very strong and varied in it's sound. He seems to be channeling the talents of Jimi Hendrix and Stevie Ray Vaughn and adding his own signature sound. I have been listening to great guitarists for over 45 years and this young man is right near the top.
B000JQUZCI|4.0|If your a horror fan you know the story, this is one of the originals. it's timeless and always a great read.
0446573027|1.0|It has been hard to get into this book when page after page is more of the same nothing.  I am pretty unhappy of reading 1/2 the book and every page contains conversation or outings that has not essence.  I don't know how many times we have gone to the crib fro breakfast.  I am about to give it up however since I just came out of the hospital after a spinal fusion, I have nothing else to read.  This book is stretched into nothing.<br /><br />Sorry that I could not find anywhere that it was written by someone else? Childs?<br /><br />Baldacci is action and move quickly with new challenges.  I am sick of this coal town.
B000JML7EC|4.0|What a great read this was. I had always read bits and pieces but finally sat down and read the entire thing.. I was not disappointed.

1400049628|5.0|This is one of those books that's cleverly written. Good humor throughout. It's a clever premise that really surprisingly works.

0545265355|5.0|I love trilogies, so when a box set comes out I always want to have all three books together. They are a great series that if you haven't read, you need to. Not just for young adults, but adults as well.
B001UV4XFQ|1.0|I bought this as a gift for my fiance. Sadly she actually likes the twilight series. I tried watching, I honestly did. They are just horrible horrible movies. In every aspect. Cinematography, acting, editing, etc, and I'm not even going to touch the horrid story line.
B003L77G8I|5.0|If you like Bones you must watch it. If you have never seen bones it is a show about a FBI agent who partners with an anthropologist to solve crime. It is a great show, not as graphic or violent as Law and Order SVU, but with good character development and interesting insight.

B003L77G6A|5.0|I really enjoy this series. It is funny, intelligent, and not gaudy or offensive some like some other shows. Every episode has a good laugh in it and I find myself watching reruns on TV because they are so funny.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I don't read romance novels.  I read the first book just to see what all the hype was about . . . and I still don't know.  But you can't read just the first one - you have to read the second and third to see how the author resolved the issues.  Which did not make me a happy reader.  It's an x-rated romance novel - and I hate romance novels.  This was one of the worst.  And it scares me to think about women in America actually reading this stuff.
B001UV4XIS|4.0|Before the set came out I got this for my younger sister who is a huge fan and did not want to wait for the collection. I bought it on sale. If you can I would get the two final movies together, instead of just the last part alone.

B009IU6N5Y|5.0|I have to admit that I haven't seen the serious version starring Daniel Day Lewis. And I know very little about Lincoln. But that hardly matters.<br /><br />I have a Home Theater. That means I get to see new movies only after they have been released to streaming or Blu-ray. Typically that's about three months. I saw all the Oscar publicity around the Daniel Day Lewis version, so I decided to watch this version while I waited.<br /><br />But before I explain why this version is the superior one, let me draw attention to the star of this film - the previously none too famous Benjamin Walker. Walker is the right height. Lincoln towered over his contemporaries. Daniel Day Lewis does not. So Walker carries along with him some instant verisimilitude. He also looks remarkably like a young Liam Neeson. I looked him up in IMDB and was delighted to learn that he got his big break in \\"Kinsey\\" playing a teenage Liam Neeson (Kinsey). The resemblance is startling. This has happened ocassionally before as when the aging Robert Redford cast the younger look-alike Brad Pitt to in effect play him in \\"A River Runs Through It\\".<br /><br />First you must understand that this movie with the silly horror movie plot and title, is indeed a big budget feature film. On Blu-ray this is a very pretty movie. The photography is great and includes expensive helicopter shots and CGI graphics. This makes for a satisfying viewing experience.<br /><br />There are also a lot of plot details that have been crafted to make the everything seem real. That of course is impossible because Abe Lincoln did not save the union from the undead blood suckers with a silver coated ax. There were no vampires who were responsible for the institution of slavery. This discordance makes the viewer think. Not many movies make you think.<br /><br />Like so many other historical movies I expect the Daniel Day Lewis version to preach to me. I expect it to come down hard with it's anti-slavery message. I expect it to try to bludgeon my brain into compliance like the all the early fifties biblical spectaculars.<br /><br />After watching this film it's impossible to view historical movies in quite the same way again. If Hoillywood can make such a good case for this preposterous premise, they can obviously make a case for anything. Ridley Scott makes historical films that always look good too. George Clooney (known in Hollywood as Red George) makes plausible looking political films. In both cases they use the modern miracles of film and digital technology to create a convincing looking visions of the world as they imagined it to be. They have axes to grind. This wonderful film has real axes.ludgeon my brain into compliance like the all the early fifties biblical spectaculars.<br /><br />After watching this film it's impossible to view historical movies in quite the same way again.

B002MQYOFW|3.0|While the book was enjoyable, I found it lacked depth.  It would probably be enjoyed best by the teenage population.  I don't see it winning any literacy awards.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I liked this game and it was very fun to play. I beat it in one morning though. Maybe next time I will put it on a harder setting.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|the download went fine,but when i went to play it on my kindle fire... IT WOULDN'T EVEN OPEN. it would show the &quot;gameloft&quot; icon,then take me back to the home spinning thing. ive played this before,and didn't have any of this happen. but now,it hates me,so im gonna hate it
B006BAEQB2|5.0|I like all of her books on royal history.  I would definitely recommend this whole series and the tudor series.
B006QS07IK|3.0|Most movies are true to the basic storyline: A young scientiest, Victor, commits scientific hubris by creating a monster that would eventually murder all his loved ones. If you like horror, this wouldn't be so bad a premise, although the true message of the book seems to be more \\"take responsibility for your actions\\" rather than \\"ambition is evil\\", which Victor practically says in the end.<br /><br />The biggest problems I had about the book are the characters. It was almost ridiculous how one of them could have stopped what was happening or at the very least their own deaths - Henry might have come earlier, Justine needn't have given the necklace straight away to the authorities (if she'd lived there her whole life, shouldn't she have known how unfair they would be?), Elizabeth or Frankenstein's father would have noticed the string of unfortunate events and would have concluded that something very, very wrong was going on and ordered extra protection. Besides that, Victor tended to view them through rose-coloured glasses (understandably, I suppose), making them almost perfect in his eyes.<br /><br />How he introduced external pieces of information was a little hard to swallow, too. For example, Elizabeth's letter about Justine. The amount of story fixed to characters who don't really matter - such as Felix's family - is very trying. Maybe the author went on about them in length because she wanted to show how the monster could somehow talk like a Shakespearan actor;  but no matter the way you look at it, it is a little ridiculous he managed to talk that way with just about a year's study, unless you accept the movie-verse information that it was more of the monster remembering than learning.<br /><br />Other than that, it was kind of interesting, though it would've been better if the characters were given more personality so the audience could care about them, too. It's worth reading, definitely; a tale of very serious consequences of an act not all too thought out.
B007V5CF5K|4.0|Very quick game play and bright interesting graphics.  It's not the most challenging in the genre, but it was perfect to play with my four year old.
B0085P2Z6E|2.0|I have enjoyed this game, all the way up to level 19 where I cannot continue because I can't get to one of the objects. I agree that this game would be much more fun if you could zoom in. I also find the random tapping penalty annoying.
B003VANOFY|5.0|This headset is really top notch. The sound quality is just amazing and the surround sound really works. Never thought I would be able to hear where ppl were in relation to me on black ops. Battery lasts &#62;10 hours on one charge and as long as you plug it in every night you can literally be wire free all day!

B001OMJGD0|2.0|Lois to the rescue! *MILD SPOILER ALERT* So Lois jumps into the water to rescue Superman as her boyfriend sits in the helicopter with her kid... what's wrong with this picture? Very dumb, cardboard-y superman movie. Too much violence and no humor worth mentioning.
B005LAIIS0|5.0|If you're expecting this to be another Liam Neeson helmed pop-corn action/thriller like Taken or Unknown, you're in for a bit of a surprise. The Grey isn't about Liam Neeson vs. Wolves like the trailers suggest; don't get me wrong, it's got fantastic action scenes directed beautifully by Joe Carnahan, but the film goes much more deeper than a typical action romp. The Grey wants the audience to ask questions about life and death, mortality and survival. And the story is told in a manner that mirrors the Alaskan wilderness where it takes place--harsh, Spartan, and unforgiving. This is the kind of film that stays with you long after the credits (which you should watch to the very end) have stopped rolling.
B0063IH60K|5.0|just like computer version but easier to win.. which makes it a lot better. there also is mothing complicated about the controls too.
B004LWZWGK|2.0|despite what the trailer suggests, this movie is more about pointless dialogue and self exploration than real superhero action.  since when do villains/heroes walk around talking about how they feel about their place in the world like they are in a counseling session.  it took about an hour and half of useless feminized dialogue for real action: that's when Bman got beaten like a two eggs by Bane.  catwoman was pointless (wanna be seductress who steals ish and flips), as was bane (muscle bound philosopher with a 1/3rd of plastic wolf mask), as was batman (deliberate, old/weak, and serious) . . . is it just me or did anyone else wonder how bane could get so big and strong with a wolf shaped muzzle (with no opening) straped to his face, which by the way made his voice sound like a high tenor.  ridiculous.  but somebody got paid.

B0095ZQ36G|5.0|First, I need to let all readers know that I worked on this book, supplying Adam with some of my research and interview materials. When I reviewed the manuscript, he had already created a solid work. The book is completely factual, all parties and events mentioned are depicted as they were, and I knew and interviewed all the persons mentioned with exception to Charlie Brown.<br /><br />Franz was an excellent pilot, a great man, a humanist, who hated the war and despised the Nazi Party, but loved flying. His Catholic background and his having been exposed to the honorable men he flew with, such as Ludwig Franzisket, Gustav Rodel, Werner Schroer, Johannes Steinhoff, Eduard Neumann, Emil Clade, Friedrich Korner, Adolf Galland, and especially Hans-Joachim Marseille reinforced that sense of chivalry, and code of honor among these airmen that is often overlooked in the post war propaganda and the maelstrom of uneducated bias.<br /><br />I suggest that this book, which is ironically in competetion with The Star of Africa, written by my wife and I, be read in public schools and by the average American. Even if you are not an aviation or history enthusiast, the human element and drama should be enough to justify your time. What the readers will also learn is that Franz, despite his humanist streak, was not that unusual among the men of the Luftwaffe. His experiences with JG-27 in North Africa, and the exposure he had to the previously mentioned men, especially Marseille, and the impressions left upon him, helped mold his attitude.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book, and I hope that this work receives all of the positive recognition that it deserves. Franz and Charlie were not unique men, but they were both very fortunate to have crossed paths. Their post war friendship, much like that of Col. Joe Peterburs who shot down Oberleutnant Walter Schuck in his Me-262, is something special. This book points this fact out. Once the guns fall silent, the professional warriors set aside their differences. That is what Edu Neuman called the ingredient \\"that separates us from the animals.\\" Highly recommended as a History and Military Book Club selection.aside their differences.

B0095VOK8I|5.0|Excellent acting, excellent writing.  Complex and interesting plots - with plenty of suspense.  I've seen several episodes and can't wait to finish the first season!
B0077EBWVI|5.0|I had never seen the original before watching this remake today. I loved the movie! After reading some reviews on here about how the original was better, I decided to watch that one too. It's nowhere near as good. The remake did a lot to improve on the original.
B005LAIIRQ|4.0|I enjoy pretty much any movie Liam Neeson is in and this was definitely a movie worth seeing. It definitely kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the movie though it was slow and sad in some parts but was worth it!
B000P0J09W|5.0|My daughter LOVED this movie.it is her all-time favorite movie.my weenie of a son did not like it...mostly because of one character...Sloth.although,there are quite a few cuss words and an inappropriate scene.it's probably a good idea to watch the movie before you let your kids watch it,or at least look up the list of cuss words online and see if it's OK.I personally LOVE the movie.don't listen to all the stupid 1-4 reviews
B00004W221|5.0|&#34;Rudy&#34; is a combination of the ultimate feel good movie and sports story.  It's great for young people who are planning to go to college.  It got high ratings from both boys and girls that I work with.  The storyline and the action scenes are balanced to appeal to both.  While Hollywood over-dramatized (fictionalized) a few scenes, you can't miss the message that discipline, diligence and perseverance will definitely pay off, if not in desired reward, then in character development.  See for yourself!
B007K3JFUQ|1.0|Awful! My husband like anything with Robert in it. He really like first one, i thought it pretty good. After watch 2 he said if there is a 3 he willnt be seeing it. Really bad stupid, not good plot, not good anything.

B008XX6J4C|5.0|I love this cd, so do my girls and husband ! Beautiful relaxing music. The Piano Guys are very talented.
B008EKON56|2.0|The idea is great in theory: charge your iThing while lining out to an external amp or similar device. I believe my particular unit is defective, though, as it is extremely sensitive to positioning of plugs and often will not work or will only partially work unless things line up in a specific way. I do not see the build quality with this device that I do with my other FiiO cables and my E17 Alpen. I'll be sending mine back for them to look at and getting another to replace it; hopefully I just got a lemon.
B000WGWQG8|4.0|find this series on John Adams and his role in the founding of our nation has been a chance to learn more and have a chance to speak with our sons about the times as they were back then

B007D5E7C2|4.0|A friend told me I would enjoy watching these two movies. I guess I have not had enough time to relax in order to be in the frame of humor that is being shown. Watched twice for the humor to catch on, but it hasn't hit me yet.

1451627289|5.0|This book was amazing. I never wanted it to end. There was not that much magic which gave him more time to develop the characters.
B004G5ZY7E|1.0|A run-of-the-mill, clich&eacute;d thriller:  serial killer vs. tough loner cop.  Gruesome details don't thrill anymore.  Norwegian locale helps, but atmosphere is pale, not used enough to give book flavor.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book.  My 20 year old son had seen the movie, and from his description I was intrigued.  The author kept me wanting to see what happens next.  This was a hard to put down read.
0375507256|3.0|The author can work convincingly in various genres and historical times.  The main &#34;device&#34; of the book, breaking five of the six stories in half , to be continued in reverse order, is a hollow gimmick that cheapens the work which would have worked better as six separate novellas.  An attempt to stitch the novellas together by a few referances to other parts is thin and unimportant.  The six-part form of this book being mirrored in the six-part form of the young composer's composition is mildly amusing.  All in all, an amusing read --except for the sci-fi section and the dystopia section; both of which are boring.

B0059XTU1S|5.0|I am a HUGE LOTR fan and this movie the \\"THE HOBBIT\\" is perfect perfect PERFECT, in every way! Thorin's acting is terrific, and he is gorgeous!, Bilbo is the most entertaining character you will ever see, Gandalf is amazing, all the dwarve's performances are amazing, and bottom line, it is not too long, because it is going by the book! BTW, my family is VERY VERY sensitive as regards motion and visuals, etc. and this movie in 3d in hfr, on a HUGE screen was absolutely perfect and didn't have any adverse affects on us at all, quite the reverse actually, as it was more enjoyable and clearer and more enjoyable in 3dhfr, really! We watched the movie in digital first when it came out, and then we went to watch it in 3dhfr, and it was 110% better than the digital version. You know a movie is great, when you can watch it once, and then go right back in to the theatre and watch it ALL OVER AGAIN? What more can I say? One of the best movies ever made if not the best! Thank you Tolkien, and thank you Peter Jackson!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This is extraordinary. I actually lived in the town of Lisbon Falls during the timeframe that it was featured in the book. Just wonder how King did his research on that town during that era. The story line is compelling and very imaginative. Also I like a somewhat happy ending.

B004XJRQUQ|4.0|The Hunger Games Trilogy<br />I finally decided to read this to see what all the talk was about - and I have a new granddog named Cato. It is interesting and sometimes even compelling, but not the best of this genre I've read.

B00AHSIQWE|5.0|This was an excellent end to a great series.  I think Nolan, Bale, and others made a great effort to put forth a work that fans could appreciate.  Some may not understand the story line, but you have to remember that TDKR is set in the future from TDK.  Also, if folks are thinking of this series as lighthearted like the series that started with Michael Keaton in '89, you are mistaken. Even in watching Justice League cartoons, you see a dark side of Batman.  That is where Nolan takes us, to the darker, intense side of Batman. I wish there could be more, but this was a great ending.
B008OTTX6G|5.0|It's like a mix of Tracy chapman and Ben Harper. Good recording on lp. Great stereo seperation. Alum is more chill than a mix of uptempo beats and songs.
0307474259|3.0|I learned a lot from this book, however I take issue with how some of the information is presented. For example, regarding the chapter \\"The Elusive Benefits of Exercise\\", just what is Mr. Taubes saying? I think many casual readers might take it as, Exercise doesn't contribute to weight loss. I know that's what i thought he was saying. However, after reading the chapter again, it appears the basis for this hypothesis is because (it is \\"assumed\\") you will, as a result of exercising more, be hungrier and thus eat more as well as burn less energy when you're not exercising because you'll be more stagnant from being tired. TO ME, this is a very misleading message that feels more like trying to sell books than educating the public.<br /><br />It would have felt more honest if the author had at least once pointed out that if you're normally very sedentary and then begin a new exercise program while adhering to a diet that maintains a total daily caloric intake that you will more than likely loose weight... (perhaps he doesn't believe that ...)<br /><br />But who wouldn't want to buy that book they heard about that says it's all about the carbs (everyone knows that now), eat as much as you want without exercise, just eliminate the carbs to control insulin and you'll be skinnier and healthier than ever. Geez, that sounds so good,i might have to buy the book again!<br /><br />Seriously, the book seems extremely well researched and shows how that past 100 years of obesity studies have been misinterpreted and hand picked to support an already biased opinion (\\"Sloth and Gluttony\\")... however, as much as i want to believe this new interpretation of the data, the books feels very biased.<br /><br />Having said that, i think everyone should buy the book ... but while reading it, ask yourself what would have happened if during Mr. Taubes many years of research, funded by his \\"huge grant\\", he had found that most previously held beliefs were true ... like say for example, saturated fats are bad for you ... (yes yes, high hdl and all that)<br /><br />There would of been no book to write! (However, that doesn't in and of itself make it any less true.)<br /><br />So, while i'm thankful for all the information in this book, I find it hard to ignore that the author spent years doing research to support his hypothesis. And specifically, the way he deals with the subject of exercise and it's roll in weight loss adds to my \\"unease\\" about some of the more questionable information in the book.  For example, is is just me or is he saying saturated fats are good for you? Seek them out! Really?<br /><br />I personally don't have the background, education or time to fully understand all of what Mr. Taubes has written. However, there's no doubt in my mind that i'll be cutting way back on all carbs, not just refined ones ... but i think i'll continue to exercise (i like the endorphins anyway...)
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Excellent book! Have to warn you thou a tear jerker!\\" Love love love this book.if your a dog lover you will truly understand this book

B002SF9YNO|5.0|Okuribito (Yojiro Takita, 2008)<br /><br />Okuribito, released in English-speaking countries as Departures, was Japan's entry for the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar in 2008; one cannot call its win a surprise in any way. This is, for about one hundred fifteen minutes of its one hundred thirty minute length, an impeccable film in every way, sincere and heartfelt and warm and funny and entirely in love with the world. And while the last fifteen minutes don't quite live up to the first bit, they're still good enough to warrant calling this one of the best movies to come out of Japan--or, for that matter, any country--in the past decade.<br /><br />Plot: Daigo Kobayashi (The Bird People in China's Masahiro Motoki) is a cellist in a struggling Tokyo orchestra...which folds just after Daigo basically mortgages his life away financing a new cello. Desperate for money to pay off the debt and unable to make rent on his Tokyo apartment anymore, Daigo and his wife Mika (Hana and Alice's Ryôko Hirosue) move to Daigo's ancestral small-town home, which his mother left to him after her death. Perusing the local paper, Daigo finds, and answers, an ad for a company called Departures, assuming they're a travel agency. Instead, he finds, they are \\"encoffineers\\", a sort of mortician whose job is to prepare the recently deceased for burial. It's a low-caste job, universally reviled, but when Daigo hears the salary, he takes the plunge while putting up a front to his wife that he's actually the travel agent he thought he would be when he left home that morning. He's not too sure about the job at first, but over time, he comes to love the work, giving the dead the same passion he gave the cello--but what will happen when his wife finds out what he's doing for a living?<br /><br />The end of the film dives straight into Hollywood shameless-emotional-manipulatgion territory; the film sets up a somewhat artificial \\"Daigo comes to terms with his childhood\\" scenario, and then executes it (albeit flawlessly). By that point, however, I was more than willing to give this movie a pass in just about any way necessary; it had already done everything I expect of a great film, and had done it all with honesty, integrity, and grace. Hard to believe he got his start in pinky film (he directed multiple films in both the Molester Train and Groper Train series), but there ya go. He's come a long way, baby. **** ½lbeit flawlessly).

Everytime a book of this ilk comes out, there are trained neurologists in tow ready to give all of the answers as to WHY NDEs happen and how the brain is playing tricks on the body and that thing called the mind.  I love reading books about Heaven and NDEs, they strengthen my hope and my faith and I seek this as I walk my daily life dealing with all kinds of people in various stages of illness, grief, happiness, life and death.  I need HOPE and REASSURANCE.<br /><br />That's where someone like a bow-tie wearing Harvard Trained NeuroEndocrinologist  comes into the picture.  Eben Alexander is a Harvard Doc who would be right on the front line to explain away any experiences a person who has just gone trough a near death experience using imaging of the brain documenting brain activity and a thorough knowledge of neurology.  Something very strange happened to the Doctor ... he developed a rare and deadly form of bacterial encephalitis that left his brain for dead (no activity).  Despite all that, Eben comes back with a \\"worms eye view\\" of his experiences as they start in a dark and slimy place and move towards beauty and vividness.  He describes things that the finite mind can only put finite information on top of ... so how can we fully understand!?  We can't fully understand and the author takes that into account and does his best to convey concepts for finite minds.<br /><br />The moral of the story is ... the skilled Specialist Harvard Doctor essentially went brain dead and came back to be able to share his experiences.  Before he shared them with anyone, he recorded them in a journal.<br /><br />Eben's book provides the \\"perfect storm of near death experiences.  As a practicing neurosurgeon with decades of research and hands-on work in the operating room behind me, I was in a better-than-average position to judge not only the reality but also the implications of what happened to me.  In essence, Dr. Alexander's book shows us through his experience that the death of the body and the brain are not the end of consciousness, that human experience continues beyond the grave.  More important, it continues under the gaze of a God who loves and cares about each one of us and the universe itself.\\"<br /><br />Dr. Alexander's book is a quick and sweet read filled with hope ... a true gift.  For the skeptic, he offers a little extra (he is afterall an academic) and at very least will cause the wheels to turn and hopefully raise a question or two.<br /><br />Dr. Eben is back on earth now and proud to share his story.  I am guessing and hoping this is one of many books he shares with us.<br /><br />5 stars!<br /><br />I originally bought the hardcover version of the book, and shared a few of them too.  I decided I wanted it on my Kindle for immediate access.  Love having that version!om behind me, I was in a better-than-average position to judge not only the reality but also the implications of what happened to me.

B009APMNB0|1.0|On WIN 7 x64:<br />I have tried it on 3 different computers:<br />Sony VAIO NW240F - works OK<br />Toshiba Portege 935-p300 - works OK<br />Asus N53JQ-XC1 - the mouse cursor disappears rendering the app (and calibration device) useless. There are no keyboard actions that would supplement non-functional mouse.<br /> Hey, guys, what about ENTER for DEFAULT BUTTON and ESCAPE for CANCEL. Ever seen this logic?<br /><br />In Win XP/SP3  32bit:<br />Doesn't even install correctly. The 'xritedevice.dll' is missing, so the app doesn't even start.<br />The USB calibration device does not install either, since there is no \\"i1display.sys\\" driver in the directory where the USB device is looking during installation.<br />Even 'hacking' (i.e. supplying 'xritedevice.dll' and 'i1display.sys' manually) does not help. The app starts, but the USB device is still not recognized.<br /><br />I've been in SW business for over 30 years. If any of my SW engineers shipped SW like this one, he/she would not work for me the next day.<br />Correction: If I ever wrote SW so bad I would fire myself on the spot.
B005DKLPF6|5.0|While this isn't Leviathan, my favorite album, it's an exception near-masterpiece of modern medal that can't be missed. Curl of the Burl got ample radio time around here and introduced my friends to a band I've always loved, and this is one of the few albums that I can just throw on and listen to all the way without any complaints. Fine, fine work.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app but I wish there was a free version of Minecraft-Pocket Edition not Minecraft Pocket Edition CORRECT!!!!!
B00999VI0Y|2.0|Bought this for use in my 2008 Infinity M35 but it does not work.  For a variety of technical reasons, compatibility is limited to just a few kinds of devices.  I tried it with the following:<br />- Memorex clock radio/iPod dock (works)<br />- Altec Lansing speaker dock (does not get power)<br />- 2008 Infiniti M35 (does not get power, with power adapter will pair but car will not recognize it as an iPod)<br />- 2010 VW CC (gets power and pairs, but car does not recognize it as an iPod)<br />- Alpine car stereo with iPod adapter cable (does not get power, with power adapter will pair but Alpine will not recognize it as an iPod)<br /><br />There are two problems here - Apple used two power schemes with earlier iPods/iPhones: 12v and 5v.  Most car adapters fed 12 volt power on the 12 volt pins.  My Infiniti does this.  Later iPods and iPhones (I have an iPhone 4) don't support 12v power and only use 5v power.  I got a 12v-5v-converter for my Infiniti to solve this problem and it works as expected.  My guess is that this Bluetooth adapter is like later model iPods/iPhones and only uses 5v power so if a dock or car or what not supplies 12v power it won't power up.<br /><br />The second problem is that a lot of more sophisticated devices like my Infiniti M35, my VW CC, the Alpine car stereo, want to talk to the iPod to get access to the whole music library.  The bluetooth interface doesn't allow this.  Basically the iPhone bluetooth interface only supports stereo audio and Play/Pause/skip-forward/skip-backward.  So these devices don't recognize the bluetooth adapter as an iPod/iPhone.  The Memorex clock radio does work because the only controls it provides to the docked iPod/iPhone are play/pause/skip-forward/skip-backward so it is fully compatible.
0684847817|5.0|this book is very interesting. i love the way it is set up. good faeries and bad faeries. thanks! :]
B00005UEAR|4.0|A \\"MUST HAVE\\" for progressive music fans.<br /><br />This is a 2-CD set, with the second of the two being the 40+ minute \\"Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence.\\"  I never warmed up too much to CD #1, so the focus of this review is on the second disc (SDOIT), which is really terrific!<br /><br />As previously covered, this is 8 separate tracks covering over 40 minutes.  The opening classical overture is complex and compelling, and lays the groundwork for the remaining pieces. The subsequent tunes carry forward and develop the musical themes originated here.  I won't cover individual tunes, but suffice to say, this CD is a terrific listening journey every time, and for me, has staying power from years of listening.  This CD is ALWAYS on my play list on long flights and I cannot listen to one part -- its ALL OR NOTHING.  DT does a nice job building the tension in these pieces to an ultimate crescendo at the end.<br /><br />Jordan's work on Solitary Shell is fantastic!!  As is John's....holy Al Dimeola on the acoustic parts!!<br /><br />I highly recommend the live DVD \\"Score\\" as well.  The performance of SDOIT with a full orchestra is killer!!!
B007EECSFA|5.0|Another fantastic book by Kate Morton. Great mystery and satisfying end. I love all her books and this is at the top.
B0000047EC|5.0|This is some of the most beautiful music ever.  Not much else to say -- get it!!!  Discovered this on recommendation from a local jazz pro and am eternally grateful.  A top \\"Desert Island\\" disc.
0316228532|1.0|I was so disappointed by this book.  I found it depressing & vulgar.  Even beyond this, in a book chock full of characters, Rowlings fails to create even one that the reader cares about.  Couldn't be more different than HP, but not a good departure in my opinion.
B004BBDHEK|2.0|The music from this album has been appearing fairly regularly on a music genome channel that I listen to quite often. Each time, I looked up wondering who the artist was, because the music sounded so generic, so cheesy, so lackluster, that it was almost out of place in this soft, instrumental mix of piano and strings from other artists. I was dismayed more than once to find that it was Yanni's work, from this album I hadn't previously heard.<br /><br />I'm no stranger to Yanni, having listened to him since the mid-80s. His works embody a particular voice that is pleasing to me. The synthesizer may be a dated instrument, but aside from a couple of samples that are jarring and utterly electronic, the high quality of his keyboard sounds lend to flawless orchestration that can seldom be managed by a skilled live equivalent. There are very few of his works that I don't enjoy, and there are a great many of his works available.<br /><br />These, on this album... The pitchbend function on his keyboard is much abused. The effect as an isolated incident can be an aural \\"ooh, that's interesting\\" thing, but as a major component, it gets annoying. The tunes on this album are repetitive, forgettable, and it's missing that Yanni voice that I enjoy so much. There's no sentimental or emotional hints. It's a faceless person playing a song that's meant to fade into the background. There's no warmth, no sense of that voiceless want that I can easily detect in his other works.
B00867GHS8|5.0|One of my fav movies of all time. Its wonderful on my new 3D tv. cant wait to watch it over and over
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is perfect for kids.  Just make sure you have the child-lock on purchasing things like coins and jewels because those cost real money.
B009JBZH54|5.0|The packaging of the discs is awesome and good quality. It came with everything it said it would. I highly recommend it.
B003L20ICO|5.0|it's funny<br />not perfect, but what is afterall?<br />Enjoyed it and recommend it and hope more movies are made like it.
B0011ZNAIC|1.0|To get straight to the point, the plot line was a total chaos.  It was apparent that no effort was put into the storyline. The first fifteen minutes of the film were promising, but it only went downhill after that.  At the beginning, I assumed that it was about the main character's search to find his place in the hive, but everything was blown out of proportion when he started filing a lawsuit.  While I understand that the movie is a work of fiction, various parts of the movie are absolutely ridiculous.  All of the scenes were unrelated to each other, and the movie as a whole just seemed like a collection of lame bee jokes.  Not to mention the voice acting was annoying.  Altogether, the movie doesn't stand a chance against \\"A Bug's Life\\" or \\"Antz.\\"  It's only plus is the animation quality, which could have been put to use for a better film.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Love the app, hate the pop ups! They interfere with the game by blocking part of the screen. Otherwise, great game!!

0062183591|5.0|I recently read professor Dan Ariely's book The (Honest) Truth About Dishonesty: How We Lie to Everyone---Especially Ourselves, as a student in the Carlow University Master's of Science in Fraud and Forensics course on Forensic Research and Analysis: [...]<br /><br />What I particularly liked about the book are the different experiments used to explain his theories. There are several chapters I found very interesting. For example, The Single Model of Rational Crime (SMORC) in Chapter 1, where Ariely tells us that people should cheat more when they stand a chance of getting more money without being caught or punished. Next there is The Fudge Factor in Chapter 2, in which Ariely states, we can benefit from cheating and still view ourselves as marvelous human beings. This balancing act is the process of rationalization Last, Cheating Ourselves in Chapter 6, people cheat when they have a chance to do so, but not by a whole lot.<br /><br />One weakness is Ariely conducts many experiments but they have no scientific evidence-based conclusions. The difference between opinion and scientific evidence is opinion is based on assumptions and myths, whereas scientific evidence is based on empirical evidence through testing and research.<br /><br />As I prepare for my professional career as a fraud practitioner, I would implicate this book when observing one's behavior when rationalization is used to explain ones transgression. Reading this book has taught me how we perceive ourselves when cheating and being dishonest.  Ariely states, when our ability to rationalize our selfish desires increases, so does our fudge factor, making us more comfortable with our own misbehavior and cheating Ariely, 2012, p. 53).
B004LWZWGK|1.0|You can't download the movie.  You can only stream it from a website.  No Internet=no movie<br /><br />I won't be buying anymore uv products
B002BWP49C|4.0|Got this promptly but the sleeve was a little smushed.  The disks were fine however.  I wasn't overly impressed with this installment of the series.

0765356139|5.0|Well of Ascension is the second in theoutstanding Mistborn series and the story picks up with two previous characters moving to center stage, the young Mistborn heroine Vin, emerging hero Elend, and the soulful terrisman, Sazed. The plot is moves forward with an entirely new feel while retaining many elements from the first story.<br /><br />This time around the story centers on the trials of building a brand new government after the battle to overthrow the previous oppressive one. It was a more subdued journey of learning more about the fascinating aspects of how Allomacy came into existence and watching world of the Final Empire evolve and grow.<br /><br />The entire story arc delves into all the elements one expects from an epic fantasy storyline, war, political intrigue, a complex magical system, moral issues, and love.  I enjoyed this second book as much as the first one.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Maybe I'm a history buff...but that's not why I so enjoyed this book. Ken Follett has the gift of creating characters in historic scenes that help understand the currents of politics and human emotions that form our past. As Churchill once said, &#34;go back in order to see forward.&#34;
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|This game is a fun and easy way to spend an hour or so. Sometimes some of the objects are doubled and it will only accept one. Decent story.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I have always love  this can  since the day I discovered it
B00932A2MC|5.0|I've watched this several times! Was fun watching it with my 13 year old grandson.  His dad loved it too!
B003WUYRGI|2.0|Hi I think this is a very good book this book really teaches you a lot hope y out think this is a very good book to
0375842209|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I thought the writing and the descriptions were amazing.  I wanted to sit and read and read - but - didn't want it to end!  This book is on my all time favorites list.
B005LAII12|4.0|First, no.  This is not a movie for kids.  Having said that, yes, this is a movie that will make a lot of us adults laugh!  Overall, it is a fun film.  Some great one-liners...just like on Family Guy. Also, since the bear sounds just like Peter, it really is like watching Family Guy.  For me, this is the sort of Mark Wahlberg film that I can enjoy.  Mark as a Physics teacher, no.  But, Mark as a stoner who talks to his best-bud-teddy...yes!  Totally believable!  If you want to laugh and can enjoy base-humor, buy this!  If you think that the Waltons was just a perfect TV show...stay away from this film.  It could damage you!
B0050PYNOY|5.0|This is one of the funniest movies I have seen in a while! If you enjoy off the wall comedies you'll love it too!!
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|It is a good game. I just finished it, and the only thing I don't like is when you use the pinch zoom, it goes against you hit count. I got a couple of 20 second penalties that way. Also the zoom is backwards. You open your pinch to expand, and pinch to make it normal size.
B00873GRU4|5.0|Wow! That really sums up this story. Well written, suspenseful, twist after twist (none of which I saw coming). Can't wait for First Shift (the next in the series) to be available for people from Aus. A great read, you won't be disappointed.
B000NQRE1E|5.0|both  version on dvd and on  blueray are excellent,theirs transfer and quality are the best.i love it looks so nice,,thank you
B0099114WO|2.0|This could have been an insightful look the impact of time and lack of attention on a relationship, and it could have taken advantage of two of the best actors Hollywood has to offer, but it didn't.<br /><br />Both lead roles became characatures rather than the characters they should have been. In particular, Tommy Lee Jones was such a cliche' of a distant husband that he was practically a cartoon.<br /><br />Possibly the most frustrating aspect of this movie was its failure to contect the dots between the two totally alienated people that awkwardly stumbled through counseling, and the two love birds passionately sharing a Kodak moment on beach at the end.  80% of this film depicted a disaffected couple heading for divorce, and then it rushed to wrap things up in a bow and send the viewers home happy.<br /><br />What a shame.
B000UR9QHQ|5.0|i love this movie for me is a classic one,is incredible theirs quality and tranfer looks so nice and looks much better.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Keeps me entertained, and works the mind. Most app that resembles the card game.  Grandkids love the game also great.
B005723JSQ|3.0|I've always been a fan of Kinsella's book. I've got every single one of them. But this one is not her best. The story was ok....typical Kinsella characters. However, the storyline was not as strong as her past works. It's ok to read when you've got nothing but time...
B0085P2Z6E|3.0|That is it in a nutshell. Like watching grass grow.Do not bother with this item.<br />Snuff said and there is no more to say.!
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This movie was so much like what we, older people, are going through after retired or lost spouses.<br />Some are angry what happened after retire, some are lost without spouses, and some are finding out meaning of life.<br />This movie made me laugh, cry, look back, and look forward to tomorrow.  Wonderful movie.

1451695195|4.0|This account by a physician of his post-death experience differs from most other accounts in several meaningful ways. First, and most important in my view, is that the author presents detailed medical facts about his condition prior to what he asserts was his physical death. He presents convincing evidence that his brain was completely dead and displayed no electrical activity whatsoever. Second, he is absolutely certain that he was indeed dead and his account of his experience includes a great deal of detail that I have never seen in the memoirs of others -- and I have read scores of books on this topic. Finally, unlike many other people who have undergone post- or near-death experiences, Dr. Alexander's medical training and understanding of the human brain makes him a highly credible judge of what actually happened to him. I am not implying that others are not credible; only that this particular author has a degree of knowledge that most others lack and therefore he has more information on which to base his analysis.<br /><br />Whatever you choose to believe, it is quite clear that this doctor experienced some highly unusual phenomena, not just because he claims to have seen 'heaven' but because he was brain dead and then, rather suddenly, revived *with all of his mental functions intact.* Several physicians who attended him are quoted in the book as saying they have no idea how someone in his condition could regain 100% function, but he definitely did. And he has been subjected to entire batteries of medical tests in an effort to ascertain just how his body was able to do this -- all to no avail. Some might call it a miracle. Overall, Dr. Alexander's story is absorbing and a worthwhile read.<br /><br />One more thing to the credit of this book is that it has an excellent bibliography from which interested readers can identify other books on this and similar topics. For me, the question of life after death was not resolved by reading this book, but it did go a good way toward opening up new avenues of inquiry and presenting some ideas that I had not previously considered.d way toward opening up new avenues of inquiry and presenting some ideas that I had not previously considered.
0345529057|5.0|Intensely descriptive literature that captivates the reader. With all the hype with the series, thought I wanted to read the books before watching. The books paint such a great picture on their own.
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run is awesome because it is app that u can move whither it and move your person around.that's why I gave it 5 stars
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I knew the ending... but I never knew Steve.  Although the writing seemed a bit choppy I'm assuming it being released was pushed by Steve's unfortunate passing, but I overlooked that because I wanted to learn more about him.  You get to see the brilliance and madness of a pure genius. I really enjoyed this book, I just wish the end was ficticious.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I was looking forward to the book coming out.  I read Bared to You right after I read FSOG and I fell in love with Eva & Gideon.  I loved that Eva was a strong independent women.  Gideon to me is hot, hot, hot!<br /><br />I must say I was a bit disappointed in this book.  I found it boring at times and I wanted to skip pages.  I feel the whole murder was just too drawn out.<br /><br />I still enjoyed the book and I am looking forward to Entwined to You.
B002VUFKG6|2.0|Written for the few and I was not one of them. Not as good as the first, but it is hard to follow a first hit.
B005ZO6NRA|1.0|I suspected this latest adaptation of Howard's iconic barbarian would fail the moment Morgan Freeman's voiceover opened the film. Sure enough, what followed was a clumsy medley of tedious clichés that lack mythology or importance--that failed in all critical areas: writing, acting, and score. Even the production values brought nothing of interest. Whatever liberties the 1982 adaptation took with Howard's canon, John Milius established a setting that gave weight and authenticity to Howard's artificial mythology, insuring the film would endure the years.  In contrast, the 2011 version is nothing more than disposable debris all too common from Hollywood.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Better than the last book. Now time to wait three years for what may be an ending.<br />All in all a great story that unfortunately May never get finished before the authors life runs out.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I don't give 5 stars almost ever, but I adore this book.  The technical detail is realistic and complete in a way I haven't encountered since Tom Clancy.  The characters are believable, and the man stranded on Mars is the exact sort of personality you'd expect to somehow survive: absurdly humorous in the face of complete disaster.<br /><br />Every new trial is another hideous kludge the protagonist has to devise by abusing billions of dollars of (discarded) NASA equipment.  I found myself puzzling alongside him, trying to figure out how to get equipment to do what it was never intended to do (and even designed explicitly NOT to do).<br /><br />This is a fantastic read for the technical tinkerer, but shouldn't be anything other than entertaining even for those not cursed with the need to take everything apart to see what it's made of.
1401235417|5.0|Hands down best batman serious, so great to see Mr. Snyder, take something like the city of Gotham, and turn it into Batman's toughest foe, and then introducing a group like the Court of Owls, was amazing. so rare to see someone create something, let alone create something in the Batman mythos and make it seem like it was always apart of the Batman's history. if you like Mr. Snyder's work here also check him out on Swamp Thing, and American Vampire, VERY VERY good books!!
B005Q1W10A|5.0|This is a gift. I am sharing this with many family members.  I have love it since I saw the first Season.  Looking forward to the 3rd season and have ordered it for myself and several relatives.  Lots of history with this movie.  It has to be number One for me with Foyle's War just slipping to second place.  Both full of history.  I highly recommend Downton Abbey.

B00992CF6W|4.0|The game was really really good but it would be gray if you could do nonlinear multiplayer. But other than that its really good. They need to update it.
086547897X|5.0|From an old school animator who truly understands animation giving secrets and enlightenment on his long journey of animating. Lots of info but worth the read if you don't want to make two bit animation.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This book touched my heart and soul. I cried and smiled throughout the reading at Jaycee's horrible experiences but smiled at her bravery and ability to make a good life for her and her daughters
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|I love this game so far but I wish it was a lil harder. It was just too easy, well so for at least.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|I like it, but I think the beginning levels are a little too easy. I'm hoping the levels get tougher the farther I get into it.
B00511PTWM|1.0|This adapter is hard to insert into the lighter socket. Once inserted, it has a loose fit. The red power light would work intermittently. Normal road vibration would cause the adapter to loose power. You would then need to push and rotate the adapter to try to re-establish power. The swivel feature is nice except you have to press in a small button to allow it to swivel. There is a threaded ring on the adapter but it is not mentioned anywhere in the instruction book. I do not know the function of this ring. I was using this in a Honda. I am returning it.
B000002IP1|5.0|I first bought this album as a cassette many years ago. Now I have the CD. I have a few of his albums, but, in my opinion, this is the best. \\"Another Day in Paradise\\" is a mastyerpiece. Other great works on this album well worth hearing are\\"All of My Life\\" & \\"Find a Way to My Heart.\\"<br />To try to describe these classics is beyond my writing abilities, so I'll leave it at that.<br />Highly recommended.
B00992CF6W|4.0|its a great game and i like it and all but, i would say i like block story more. i mean this is worth playing but i would rather play block story
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Good game. Cheep price. What else can you say? The value for the price can`t be beat. It`s worth you time and effort.<br /><br />Just give it a try.
B00785P2QC|5.0|good game addictive very fun cant stop playing did this to get stuff for game don't know if I'm done yet but I will stp<br /><br />(
B000001EHS|5.0|Simply put, I've feel this is the best Def Leppard album ever put out.<br /><br />All the great songs are added and the sound is great.<br />Good insert and info as well.<br /><br />Other DefLep releases are good, including the orig albums; however,<br />&#34;Vault&#34; can't be beat.  - the price is good as well.<br /><br />This just doesn't require a huge writeup...  it's just good.<br />If you're a DL fan(and who isn't?), you need this!<br /><br />FIVE STARS
B004VMVTNU|5.0|Really like the app! This clock is perfect since the beginning and keeps getting better :) I've tried a lot of different clock apps and this by far is simply the BEST!!
B0094BB4TW|2.0|How long will it take to get this broken app. to work with the Kindle Fire HD 8.9?  I know  that you can side-load the 2.0 version of the Facebook apk -- which is supposed to fix the News Feed problem -- but I haven't yet tried that work-around....
B00785P2QC|5.0|It is definetely a good game. I would use this as something to entertain myself when bored. Fun game and I like how it makes you money residual!
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Its indiana jones!  Love this movie.  I even like the new one.  I don't think Raiders of the lost ark transfers to blu ray well but the quality seems better on the rest.  Maybe they used cheap film cameras for film Rotla.
B0085P2Z6E|3.0|Thought this game would be fun, but it is a headache instead. I try to go to the 3rd level but end up back at the 2nd level.
B001VIMCW4|3.0|This installment of the James Bond series of movies was not as good as previous versions. Not awful, but not great.
B004WCTLNY|4.0|Great, way cool movie. Damon does a super job again. And his co-star is not to shabby either.<br />Would recommend.
B00631VJIC|5.0|Bought for my husband who is a die hard fan of the show....he loves it! Plays it all the time.
B003Y5H4SO|3.0|There's a reason why you probably didn't see this in theaters. Not one of Night's best...not even close...not terrible, but not very good.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Human beings have to learn how to live without destroying themselves, but in case they don't, there's a hope to live a happy life at the end...
B002VHI8FE|5.0|Hard to put down once you start!  If you liked Game of Thrones you will like this.  Characters had depth.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Great one.<br />Enjoyed this can't wait for the next one.<br />You won't be disappointed . You so t want to put it
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Well written, interesting plot.  Characters were believable.  A plot that many parents have probably imagined themselves in and how they would react.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|She's more relaxed and past having to repeat songs she did on the show. This album has great voice and sound!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I fell in love with season one. I do have to say I started finding flaws in season two, but I mostly just found the character development and story line to be entertaining.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|These books are excellent. I have read then 3 times now. the more I read them the more I pick up. I am ready for more!
B00007EDY5|4.0|The adapter worked flawlessly for a series of family portraits.  I did not to extensive testing, so can give no further comment.

B003UYV08E|5.0|surprized to see Robert Downey Jr playing such a role but loved it & all the iron man movies.alot of action never boreing.
0743298039|5.0|Beautifully written! This is one of the best adult books I have read in a long time. The language and writing is so amazing. Well done, well written and a fabulous story. Immediately interesting and woven. I've recommended it to several people -- all returning with rave reviews as well. I only wish Diane Setterfield had another novel to read. I can't impress enough that this story is great!
B00005OCMR|5.0|You're either gonna love this movie or you're gonna fall asleep! I'm a big fan of Tron! A movie that was ahead of it's time! Great movie for the whole family!

B004LDLCDG|3.0|The Bard's supposed last play, it is problematic but still enjoyable if done right. The subtext in this play is fun to mess with if you're every lucky enough to direct it. The dynamic between Caliban and Ariel as slaves or indentures to Prospero and likewise Miranda's subservient role as daughter make for great staging and conflict as well as literary analysis.<br /><br />Great speech:<br /><br />\\"Be not afeard; the isle is full of noises,<br />Sounds, and sweet airs, that give delight and hurt not.<br />Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments<br />Will hum about mine ears; and sometime voices<br />That, if I then had waked after long sleep,<br />Will make me sleep again; and then in dreaming,<br />The clouds methought would open, and show riches<br />Ready to drop upon me, that when I waked<br />I cried to dream again.\\"<br /><br />Favorite Other Lines:<br /><br />\\"We are the stuff that dreams are made of\\"<br /><br />\\"Oh, Brave new world to have such people in it.\\"
B00914JWSW|5.0|I LOVE BARBARA STREISAND AND HAD THE OPPORTUNITY IN MY LIFETIME TO SEE HER IN CONCERT IN NOVEMBER THIS YEAR. ONCE AGAIN I FIND IT UTTERLY RIDICULOUS TO HAVE TO BE REQUIRED TO WRITE MORE THAN I WANT, WHICH MAKES ME DISGRUNTLED AND NOT SO WILLING TO SHOP OR RATE PRODUCTS VIA AMAZON!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Could not put it down.  Will read more of his books.  Too many words are required for this review. Bye
1451695195|5.0|Excellent book.  A must read for believers.  It truly gives hope to a life eternal with our Lord Jesus.  Amen!
1401216676|5.0|I bought this for my 26 year old husband and he adores it! The graphics are superb and the story is just amazing. I would recommend this to any Batman fan!
B009MO57H6|1.0|this movie is so horrible it continue to ruin the franchise everything about it i thought berry would be cool in here but nope i was soo wrong and wesker i mean please everything about this is horrible its like wtf why did you make this i aint spending money or even 1 cent on this i told my family i would go and they said they would pay for me and even then i didnt wanna go but i did and it wasnt even worth my time away from scrolling up and down on facebook just dont waist money get a bootleg if its free or go to a friends house who has it or something
0345472322|5.0|The book talks about the differences in two types of mindset - fixed and growth and shows the impact of being in either mindset.<br /><br />I have read other books on similar topics, but the author Carol Dweck puts things very interesting and keeps the flow of the book.<br /><br />There were two things that stood out for me.<br />1. People with growth mindset are better at estimating their abilities as they are more accurate information about their abilities even though unflattering.<br /><br />2. Praise achievement and not talent. This one just had a \\"wow, that's just brilliant\\" effect on me. Having a child to raise, I'm always looking for such pointers. This is going to be the best take-away for me from this book.<br /><br />\\"Beware of success; it can knock you into a fixed mindset - I won because I have talent therefore I will keep winning.\\"
B000AYEL1A|5.0|One of my favorite CD's and movie and have looked for it for a long time. Barbra is one of my favorite singers and her voice just blows my mind. I would recommend it.
0345803485|5.0|I wanted to read this book because everyone kept talking about. Once I got my hands on a copy I could not put it down. I mean literally every chance I got I had my head in the book. Ana a very naive girl gets more then she bargained for with the rich and powerful Christian Grey. I too like Ana fell in love with Mr.  Grey and his issues. It was a good read and I can't stop thinking about the elaborate sex scenes. The writer really made you feel like you were there. At least it was that way with me cause I was hot and bothered reading this book.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|I grew up watching this movie and it is one of my favorites. The spirit of Christmas and the meaning of Christmas for me is giving and this movie is well acted and has meaning and hope to it. I would recommend this movie.
0345803493|5.0|So I just literally finished this book and I can't wait to read the last one. So much more was revealed about Christian and Ana was able to break down his barriers and reservations. So much happened in this book. Him realizes he loves her, him overcoming his sadist ways, and even coming to terms that they are planning a wedding. Can't wait to see how Ana old boss plots against them.
0805095772|5.0|My granddaughter really loves this book, especially the purple cat (her favorite color). We have read it many times! Love Eric Carle.
B003VANOFY|1.0|I found this headset to be a bit low quality. First, the build quality seems low. The headset itself feels rattly and loose and the plastic construction feels cheap. It's held up so far but I wonder how long it will really last under constant use.<br /><br />The earcups only fold outward so when you fold them to set it on your desk, the earcups are generally pointing up instead facing the table (unless you turn the entire set upside down). I have some non-gaming Audio Technica phones that fold both ways. Not having this feature makes me miss it in the Logitech headset.<br /><br />The \\"7.1\\" sound is pretty much faked and a gimmick. Even disabling this fake surround sound is a pain and requires some tweaking. I wish I had gone for the regular stereo set instead. I tend to leave it off.<br /><br />Although these issues are a pain, I could live with them if that was it. However, the biggest issue I have is the wireless syncing. The entire wireless system with syncing, driver, and G930 app is very poorly designed. I don't have an extreme amount of wireless noise in my house, yet I am constantly having to deal with sync issues. Sometimes it works after a restart, sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes it will sync, then disconnect a few seconds later. Sometimes I cannot get it to work at all and have to change USB ports which causes Windows to detect it as a \\"new\\" device and resets all the settings. The Logitech driver is completely unhelpful with this and only suggests switching to a different USB port. Even now, I am looking at the Configure G930 utility and it thinks the headset is not synced yet I am getting sound through it. It is simply a poorly designed solution and is the main reason I knocked off 3 stars.<br /><br />With all these flaws, overall, I would NOT recommend this headset.
B003LXSY60|5.0|bar none the black keys are just what music needed. I went to see them live at the staple center. great show
B007KWD7BK|5.0|THAT'S THE SQUATCH ON VOCAL THAT GUY IS RIGHT !  Olga used to play cards with him on Friday nights, but every time he went up in the woods to crap someone showd up with a camera and he finally just quit coming around:  any  way ~  I like this ! so many of these attempts are boring ... not this one the drummer gets into some really cool timing here adding, leaving off quarter measures half measures what ever suits his or her fancy at the time. The freestyle feel is great. The singer is right on get the room hazy and slip away man. Leads are killer freaky. Doom trodden yet bright green and uplifting...I feel so warm and fuzzy about my choice to buy this record it's lt makes me sorta well... you know ATMOSPHERICALLY CONCUPISCENT... there I said it.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|I watched this series when it was broadcasted and really enjoyed being able to watch the program again at my leisure.
B000062Y44|5.0|I've watched this movie with my son many times. Though it deals with depression, it's a heart-warming movie. Funny, too. The sound-track by Badly Drawn Boy is a gem.

1451688091|5.0|Team of Rivals--  Very well written.  She must have spent years and years doing all the research to put this book together.
B008ZDC7M8|1.0|I just received my copy of &#34;The Story of Film: An Odyssey&#34;, and I'm having trouble getting through the first episode. It's a shame that the writer/director, Mark Cousins, didn't have a trusted friend around him who was honest enough to say, &#34;Hey, your narration, to be kind, is lousy. Use a pro.&#34;<br /><br />Cousins has a strange speech affectation while narrating where he ends every sentence as if he's asking a question. It's not a natural way of speaking. A statement ends with a downturn in tone, a question ends in an upturn. He ends virtually every sentence with an upturn in tone. The thing is, I've heard him speak in another documentary, and that odd delivery doesn't exist! So, it seems his narration style was actually a conscious choice. It may sound trivial but, believe me, after several minutes of this, let alone several hours, it becomes very grating.<br /><br />Alas, Mr. Cousins is an example of a filmmaker whose ego ruins what might have been his masterpiece. But the film has other problems besides the narration.<br /><br />As for the history of film presented, from what little I could watch, I found it preposterous. Cousins has very few &#34;experts&#34; on camera to back up his assertions, so we are to believe what he says just because he says them? He has the audacity to state that one filmmaker &#34;borrowed&#34; from or was &#34;influenced&#34; by another because of a slight similarity of a scene. This isn't fact or history, it's his opinion!<br /><br />Somebody was foolish enough to indulge Cousins by giving him a ton of money to ramble and mumble<br />over disjointed scenes of film clips and his ridiculous reconstructions of filmmakers techniques. Unfortunately I was foolish enough, and a big enough film buff to be awed by the title and the length of the series, to hand over my money without knowing anything about the film's contents or its writer.<br /><br />I would implore anyone reading this, do not throw away your hard earned money on this trite. If you must watch it, Netflix has the entire series available for instant streaming. I'm quite upset because I paid for it before it was available on Netflix.<br /><br />There are many who will defend this film, calling it a masterpiece, epic, historic and a thousand other flowery adjectives. That's OK, denial is understandable after spending $60 and expecting so much and getting so little. Poor souls, they tied themselves to a chair and kept their eyelids open a la &#34;A Clockwork Orange&#34; because, damn it, this film is important! It's long and was expensive! So what if one can't hear half the things Cousins says, because every sentence he utters trails off into an incomprehensible mumble. This is fine since only half of what he says is accurate anyway. And that's debatable.<br /><br />If you're still planning on purchasing &#34;The Story of Film&#34;, do me, rather, do someone a huge favor and buy it on eBay...&#34;like new, only partially watched...&#34;on this trite.

B008MM9630|5.0|I can't get enough of this game. The only thing I wish was different is to be able to trade gold for crystals.  Still love it though.
0792844890|5.0|Mel Brooks offends everyone in a way that you laugh so hard that your stomach hurts and you are crying so hard from the stupidity. I love it! Thank you.
0312576463|1.0|This book is hard to slog through. The characters start out interesting, but they become increasingly far-fetched and unrealistic. Not an enjoyable read, and fans of other Franzen books will be disappointed.
B008MEM24S|5.0|just as fun as where's my water!  I keep playing and trying to finish all the levels.  secret file levels, too!
B000002KDI|2.0|I bought Rust Never Sleeps and loved it, so I got this album as a follow-up. It falls far short of what I thought it would be, and the sound quality of the recording is terrible. The whole album sounds bland and mono-tone.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|brilliant story telling from Chris Nolan.  Epic in every imaginary way.  I dont think I would see another Batman reboot because it would pale incomparision.
B009HV2JT8|3.0|Too much political BS in this film to make it fun. Im into history as well as horror and sci-fi, it's either one or the other not both, I believe this film could have been a much better movie as just a horror film with out th politics, was it written by a leftist?
B002G1YPH0|4.0|I have this in an AMD build and it is working great so far. I have had it installed for about 1.5 years now.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Seriously? How can you not love this movie? It's great. You laugh at the toilet scene. You cry at the helplessness of the times.
0316212377|5.0|As a lifelong lover of Banks (preferably the Ian M Banks books) the Sonata is a significant step forward in terms of writing quality and plot development, and provides a much-awaited peek into the workings of the Minds. If you haven't read it, make sure you do.
B00A14SQBU|5.0|One of her best. My favorites are {I'm just a fool} and {Cease Fire}. Definitely a great purchase. Blake Shelton and Christina really perform crazy together in (I'm just a fool).
B00992CF6W|4.0|Even though this game doesn't have survival it's still a good game.<br />I Will 5 star this when it gets survival.
B0092SPYQG|5.0|Many, many, many great songs. They keep bringing the hits while not changing beyond their normal style. Their slow change in style keeps me hoping for the next best song.
B00005OAE6|5.0|It's a wonderful album. Had it before, but after years of wear and tear a new one was in order. Great quality CD and it's Bob Seger... he can't make a bad album!
B00867GHS8|5.0|This is the most artistically beautiful film that I have ever seen (and I am old!). The colors are vibrant;and, the underwater anemone, corals, and plant life are beautiful. The 3D effects have the fish coming off the screen into your lap, sometimes even making you duck. This collection has it all: DVD, Blue Ray, 3D, Digital, and Bonus CD. I saw this in the theater initially with my 4 y/o. My wife and teen-age daughter resisted my intention to purchase NEMO again for home in 3D since they had already seen the 2D version. Wow! was their reaction at seeing the 3D version. They couldn't believe how incredible it was, or how fun it was to watch again in the dazzling 3D latest format. A word to those who may have &#34;older&#34; 3D DVD players or TV's. I thought that I had defective 3D-DVD's as I had very obtrusive colored bands of video noise on the 3D. After a helpful person on my review noting this advised me that it might be the HDMI cable, I investigated further. It was not the HDMI cable, but my 2 year old DVD player needed a firmware update to be able to use the latest 3D encoding. Presto -- problem solved and great, great video!<br /><br />In summary, if you have 3D, and liked NEMO, you will absolutely love this for yourself or to give as a gift. If you have any trouble with colored bands of noise, check the firmware versions of your DVD player and TV, and update if they are not the latest. (Updating is easy, at least on some models such as Samsung: either online, download and USB, or even by DVD.
B0042KZJ5K|5.0|Anyone into some bluegrass and old timey music will love this. I bought this CD because I fell in love with the movie and the soundtrack so I finally bought it. It's worth the money!
B005G48Y58|5.0|Just like you would expect, for a girl trained as an assassin, her life is violent and terrifying and she is not in as much control as she wishes. Hanna is amazingly, awesomely good at what she does. She just needs to figure out if it's what she wants to be doing.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|beautiful and fun. i watched it with my daughter and cried at the end. it is our new favorite !
B003O86FMW|4.0|I loved the grim, beautiful image of Katniss trying on her wedding dress, knowing she would not be able to carry through with even a show wedding. I thought that the steady beat of direness and hopelessness and fight-against-hope was perfect.<br /><br />I thought that the Games in this one were even better-plotted and more awesome than the first book.<br /><br />Read if: You loved the first one, you're not afraid of actual dystopian actions.<br /><br />Skip if: You are happy with the conclusion of the first one and want everyone to be ok.
0307591549|4.0|This book helps you to reset.  Our minds are a powerful thing and what we think is many times who we are on the outside.  Reset to happy.
B007UPNA6Y|3.0|As usual, a good page turner, but don't think it is up to Child's past standards. However, a good read overall.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|There was a constant wondering of what the character was doing.  I had no idea what the ending was going to be.  Took a lot of thought  to plan so that justice was done and the good guys came out happy.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|my daughter loves it and so does my niece i even watched it with them and i agree it was a good movie
B004KKX80A|5.0|My son loves the beyblades from Japan.  They cost more but it's what he wanted for his birthday. It shipped quickly and arrived in great shape.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|this game is much improved with pinch zoom.  there used to be parts of the game I could not pass due to things being behind the menu bar....zoom has alleviated this issue. the only complaint I have is that if I move the zoomed in board around it thinks I am attempting to select where I am touching and I get time penalties for clicking on the wrong items. otherwise- very entertaining.
081297381X|5.0|This, along with \\"Fooled by Randomness\\", is one of my most influential books.  I am fascinated by any book which questions common misconceptions and fallacies.  However, for thos looking for a light read, look elsewhere.  Taleb's dense prose often requires re-reading of certain paragraphs to grasp the meaning.  If you think you can 'manage' risk and you think you understand the likelihood of extreme events, this is the book for you.
B007FH9GA6|5.0|It was fast paced, and tight.  If there were and slowdowns, I didn't notice them.  All of the actors were superb.  It compares in content to the Swedish original movie, but with added whiz/Bang
B008TSVZHM|5.0|This item is really functional and very cute. I wish I had more MicoSD cards so I could buy more.
B00006V9A0|5.0|Growing up in Seattle I have heard my share of Nirvana and have always been a fan.  Fast forward 15years I noticed I could not find any of there CD's, hopped on Amazon and it was as simple as that!<br /><br />Absolute classic that should be part of any collection.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|This Blu-ray rises to the challenge: the video transfer is better than that of The Dark Knight.  It may not be the best Blu-ray release of the year, but it is certainly righteous.  If the digital copy is unimportant to you, then everything is good.  This movie gave me chills all over again watching it at home.
B004EPZ06G|5.0|This movie is sure to have you cracking up from beginning to end.  A monkey and a tiny penis you'll see, nuff said!
B005LAII1C|5.0|This movie is hilarious. This deal is perfect cause you get all three formats at the price of one. I bought two as gifts
B007VYDFMS|5.0|Amazing and impressive. I really really liked it. It'a a very lovely and throughout bibliographical review of his great career. I have not seen so many powerful images of Bob Marley. He remains the king of the kings of music forever
B008G59IKO|4.0|Better late than never right? I slept on the second Green Day of the album of the year [[ASIN:B008G59IKO Dos]], despite purchasing it when it materialized in November.  Regardless, &iexcl;Dos! is consistent with [[ASIN:B008C1O8CA Uno]] if not more enjoyable and innovative in some respects. Every cut grooves, even \\"Nightlife,\\" a cut in particular that is slower than the multitude. A contrast to the first album, there seem to be more risks on Dos, which should be apparent to both fans and casual listeners.  Unfortunately for Dos, its sells have been even less spectacular than that of Uno - about half to be exact of Uno's debut.  A shame, given Dos may offer more triumphs.<br /><br />\\"See You Tonight\\" is a surprising start, lasting all of 1:06 serving as a prelude or intro. There is strummed rhythmic guitar and a brief vocal performance. The introductory cut definitely gives off an air of mysteriousness and unpredictability. The real affair begins with the grooving \\"F*** Time,\\" which is completely different from anything on Uno.  Instead of delivering an ultra quick, punk-savvy tempo, the band opts for a bluesier mid-tempo cut, borrowing its harmonic sensibilities on the chorus directly from the blues idiom.  Keeping its punk appeal alive, none needs to look any further than the title to see the sensibility of the band's revivalist style.<br /><br />\\"Stop When The Red Lights Flash\\" is consistent, opening within pummeling drums and keeping the guitars heavy, dirty, and driving.  It may not quite reach the compelling appeal of the opener, but it's both succinct and enjoyable, something that bodes well in Green Day's favor on Dos. On the catchy \\"Lazy Bones,\\" Billie Joe Armstrong's vocals are particularly well produced, most notable on the first verse where he has plenty of space to sit atop the production. \\"Lazy Bones\\" also allows for the biting Armstrong to get in his tough, punk talk (there is a reason for that parental advisory warning folks).  Four tracks in, it's all good.<br /><br />\\"Wild One\\" is a mid-tempo hit from a first listen.  Well written and catchy, Green Day are on autopilot on this, arguably Dos's valedictory moment.  While there is no consistent chorus, there are some key repeated portions such as \\"She's my wild one...\\" and \\"She gave up on Jesus, for living on Venus...,\\" both followed with various lyrical variations.  \\"Makeout Party\\" speeds the tempo back up, finding frontman Armstrong delivering one of the album's more feisty performances.  It may not be quite the likes of Uno's superb \\"Let Yourself Go,\\" but it rocks for sure. Never underestimate the power of an addictive groove and snarling punk-infused vocals.<br /><br />\\"Stray Heart\\" keeps the tempo going and finds Armstrong in top-notch form.  \\"Everything that I want, I want from you/but I just can't have you/everything that I need, I need from you/but I just can't have you\\" Armstrong belts on the the ultra catchy hook.  Pleasant despite the circumstances of the songwriting, this may be the happiest \\"Stray Heart\\" ever. \\"Ashley\\" doesn't let up or concede one iota of momentum, driving even more than \\"Stray Heart.\\" The brighter vibe of \\"Stray Heart\\" is abandoned for minor key sensibility, in which Billie Joe Armstrong asks 'Ashley' such pointed questions like \\"...are you running around? now you're crying at a bloody murder!\\" and \\"...are you bumming around? Now you're crying on my cold shoulder!\\" He also declares she's no bleeping \\"saint.\\" Green Day at it's best.<br /><br />\\"Baby Eyes\\" drives within its brief 2:21 duration (\\"I pulled the trigger from the shooting stars/I am the motor in your crashing car...\\") as does \\"Lady Cobra,\\" which features a simple but effective harmonic progression.  The guitar solo is a highlight here as are the background vocals, adding even more color to the cut. \\"Nightlife\\" slows things down, but not like a ballad - there is still a strong, discernible rhythmic groove. Sensually-charged, Lady Cobra adds a bizarre rap, something we definitely haven't associated with the band (\\"What's that I hear? You want to go for a ride? Well, don't be afraid boy to come inside...\\") It's definitely interesting - and to each his own.  I definitely dig the groove - jury's still out on Lady Cobra's seductive, whispered rhymes.<br /><br />\\"Wow! That's Loud\\" is just that.  Additionally, it is the album's lengthiest cut at just shy of 4 ½ minutes - Green Day know how to keep things brief.  \\"Amy\\" closes the effort with Armstrong accompanied only by electric guitar. More of a notable statement like Uno's \\"Oh Love,\\" \\"Amy\\" finds the band opting for more serious fare than what constitutes the majority of Dos. It's solid and Armstrong performs it well, but I wouldn't call a 'favorite.'<br /><br />All-in-all, [[ASIN:B008G59IKO Dos]] is solid and enjoyable album. If you have grown accustomed to 'heavier' Green Day, this is not it. This album like &iexcl;Uno! avoids the depth of either [[ASIN:B0002OERI0 American Idiot]] or [[ASIN:B001SAQVDQ 21st Century Breakdown]]. Some will laud that, others will scrutinize it. Personally, I fall between both extremes. I do believe, regardless, Dos is a solid album, weird Lady Cobra raps or not.haven't associated with the band (\\"What's that I hear?

B0084IG8TM|4.0|Would be nice to get this product like most DVD's sold today as a combo pack which has the DVD, Blu-Ray, and digital copy as one. This has nothing to do with the seller or this purchase as they have no control over the combo package but more for the publishing house that makes these combo packs.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|This story has been told before. Many times, But this takes on a classic tale is funny. To the max. It charmed me to no end!
0385535147|5.0|A fast read.  Well paced.  Different twist on the usual Grisham tale.  I would highly recommend this one.  Buy it.
B00005JM02|5.0|Every thing was good cheep came on time and the quality was vary good  as they said it was :)
B0094BB4TW|1.0|6 weeks or so with the same news feed problem!!!!!  Maybe I should return the Kindle and get a tablet that supports GooglePlay.
B000P0J0AQ|1.0|The disc was scratched and wouldn't play for the second half of the movie. I guess you get what you pay for.
B008458O3S|5.0|This is a great game that doesn't take too long to pick up. The longer you play the more complicated the game gets and the more challenging as well. It's nice there are multiple ways to solve each puzzle, like for one I made a really complicated solution for, which worked, but then thinking about it again I redid it and created a simpler, more elegant solution.<br /><br />The game also saves your puzzles so if you want to go back to a previous solution to see what you did you can.<br /><br />It's also easy to quickly launch the game, play a puzzle for a little bit and whether or not you solve it you can pick up where you left off later.
B0058VW36U|5.0|omnom is sooooooooo cute!!! and it is challenging.  Very cool game.  I like it a lot.  I play it a lot
B008D28HYS|5.0|I have played many nonogram puzzles including all the Picross games and other online ones. This however was the first time I ever saw colors used in the puzzles! It was a nice new twist on the game that did require some new strategy to the game, but was not too hard to pick up. This really allows the final pictures to be much more detailed and vivid!<br /><br />Even if you have never played a nonogram game before I would highly recommend this to anyone who likes puzzles and using a little bit of logic.
B003Y5H53S|5.0|Love Rango! It is one of my favorites. I guess i think this is an ok kiddo movie, but really think it is more for the adults in all honesty.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This is a great app to just pick up and learn quickly. It requires lots of logic and thought to complete a puzzle but when you are done you don't just have a completed puzzle, but you have a nice picture! If you can guess what the picture is while you are working on it it can even help you guess where the next spaces will be.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator is wonderful and is beautiful on my kindle fire hd. Great app to have at my finger tips. Love it!
B000003CKH|4.0|If you know and like this band, my guess is you probably have this album. It has some of their greatest hits in \\"Nugget,\\" \\"The Distance,\\" and \\"Stickshifts and Safetybelts,\\" and has some other great songs as well. You can't really compare this band to many others, as their style is truly unique. But if you like the style and only know a few songs, I would highly encourage you to buy this album. Its a lot of fun, great music for a road trip or otherwise, and I hope you enjoy it! I know I did!
1451648537|5.0|This biography portrays the life of a genius who changed the lives of a large number of people around the globe. Steve Jobs was a genius, but a flawed human being. However, he touched all our lives in various ways. A must read.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|The series is still so good...when does book 6 come out?????  Like all the rest, the most ridiculous stuff happens in the last 200 pages.
B00A3DZ61W|1.0|App will not download on tablets due to an unknown reason. Everyone please send error reports maybe someone will get the hint.
B008MM9630|4.0|This is a fun free game. It does have many glitches, especially if you are playing on a Kindle. Updates are way behind everyone else, friends do not work properly and not all items in the game work the way they should. I do enjoy playing it although it is frustrating at times.
B00637HXNG|5.0|If you are a Scorpions Fan and have a 3D TV 83&#34; and 1100 watts of 6.1 rock concert surround sound like I do this DVD is for you. Klaus can still sing and this DVD rocks all the way through. If your contemplating getting this DVD don't its worth every cent !!!!! You will not be disappointed.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Bought this for my daughter for Christmas and was an amazing price at $3.99. She absolutely loves Dr Seuss so this is another perfect gift.
0525425764|5.0|Both my hubby and I love John Grisham, the book was ok, but not one of grishams' best works, still worth a read though.
B00005JPS8|4.0|A instant classic. This movie is a must for any Marvel or action fan. Robert Downey Jr. is amazing as Iron Man and I now cannot picture any other Iron Man. Price was lower than the department stores also.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I could not put this book down, I read it until it was over! i cannot wait to finish the trilogy! This book was action packed, it kept you on the edge of your seat and kept you wanting more!
B0034G4P80|5.0|I love the Marvel universe and I think this movie was great. Chris Hemsworth does a great job as Thor. A definite must have for any action or Marvel fan. Priced great too.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Love the films and enjoy having them on on set. Transfers are the same as the individually packed blurays. So if you have them there aren't any new extras just all packed I'm the same set for convenience
B0042RJWTC|5.0|Intriguing story line, very believable characters, and a wonderful depiction of the times.  A must for any serious collector of historical movies.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Breast game for free. Haven't seen a way to get rid of the advertising. Worth a couple of dollars to remove it.
B00009Y3L4|5.0|I don't much care for the story but I love the music.  Liza is the original \\"Liza\\".  She is great in a part that she totally devours.  Fortunately for all of us with a DVD we can skip over the rather tasteless parts.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|I was in the mood for a movie where something blows up every couple of minutes, where someone dies almost as often and where the good guys clearly win and the bad guys clearly loose.  This movie hit all those nails right on the head.  It was also fun to see all these aging action heros interact with one another on the same screen at the same time.
B004ETVAH0|5.0|This is a very good tribute to Les Paul.  The musicians are all great and Imelda May is a wonderful vocalist.
0374214913|3.0|The general frame of the story is a good one and promises much, but only partially delivers. There is certainly enough imaginative material here for an entertaining narrative, but the payoff is disappointing and those with any knowledge of cryptography will find the final solution puzzling--just why a simple substitution cipher fails an attack by a powerful assembly of computers is mystifying and hardly credible. The author wraps things up quickly at the end, but it fails to satisfy.
B0085Z8F4A|1.0|My fist ever Review.<br />The movie is a take off of Aliens, way back 70 something. Simple drivel. Anyone who likes mission, military forces, how ANYONE would run an op, especially expensive equipment. And you have a rogue walking cyber computer on your Team?  He would have been waxed first.  Go see the old Aliens movies, I bought, watched 2/3 through, simply a waste for those in the know.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this app has fun yet simple games that are easy to play but are challenging enough to keep you comming back for more.
1881273873|5.0|Very interesting insight in to our behaviors and our personalities.  I loved the book so much I bought it so I can highlight key points to remember.
0142410373|5.0|Such a great story for little girls today.  It's not about being the prettiest girl or having an attitude, but about adventure and standing up for yourself.  Highly recommended.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I find this app very useful as a college student only thing I'd like to see is color coordination.  Other thank that it's perfect.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|I have not had any issues with this app.  Zoom and saving levels both work.  If you like seek and find games younge will like this game.
1451695195|5.0|Loved this book but it would have been even better, in my opinion, with less scientific detail & more descriptions about the author's experience on the \\"other side.\\"  Still, it's a book that I couldn't put down & am hoping Dr. A will write another in the near future.  Also, I can't understand how one could have this experience, be given this blessed healing & information & have been changed to the extent that Dr. A says he has & not have been determined to never eat another \\"nice steak.\\"  It would have been interesting to know, since he was enlightened to the point of understanding how \\"we are all connected\\" in love, whether or not he is now a vegetarian.  If not, why on earth, not?
B0050R0XPA|5.0|We had a great time putting this little village together over the Thanksgiving holiday. We're buying another to put together over Christmas.
B009IU6N5Y|1.0|I ended up purchasing this video and it was not really worth the money. I should have rented the video first.
B007C4ZJ3K|4.0|I don't understand why people rated this film so badly.<br />The largest flaw in the film was Gina explaining to a car-jacked-nobody, and making him memorize<br />a bunch of actions she had taken - for who? and what purpose? not explained well.<br />The fight scenes are fabulous - This actress is a professional mixed martial arts champ.<br />For some of the fight scenes, the actual actors played the parts - vs. stunt doubles.<br />I thought it was great vintage cloak and dagger - only updated to today's contracted 'operators'.<br />The gun fights were equally done with care.<br />The shoot settings were world class as well.<br /><br />I have to give it 4 stars for Gina Carano's work in this film. Bravo!<br />I do hope we see her in more films.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|When you only do one Christmas album you have to do it right.  We love Rod and his mellow voice.  A great CD.
B001TXWJ4M|1.0|And it's just okay by the thinnest of hairs.  Don't bother watching this series unless you already have no life and no promise of ever having a life.  And they actually paid someone to star and act in this drivel?  I'm just saying..
B007N85ZXY|5.0|Great renditions of Americana classics. I don't know if &#34;Get A Job&#34; is an Ameicana classic but what the heck. It's the Niel Young we love.
0805092447|5.0|This is a great children's book that has been around for years.  It is definitely a classic.  I highly recommend it.
B009H442DG|5.0|I am enjoying the christmas music cd. I loved listening to olivia,john barbra, and all the other special guests.<br />Its nice to have a varity of christmas music and that I have. I bought this, jackie evancho, rod stewat, michael bueble,<br />barry manilow to name a few recently.<br />If you buy this cd you will like it guarranteed.
B000FC13Y0|5.0|Entertaining from start to finish<br />Magical, interwoven tales of adventure with the happy ending we all hope for.<br />I've never read a gaiman book that let me down.
B009G7ZYPY|4.0|I enjoy istening to this cd. Although the version of SOMEWHERE is not my favorite susan sings it beautifully. I guess Im spoiled since I heard Judy sing it. I like susan and donny singing together.<br />I dont know how ANYONE CAN CALL jACKIE Evanco a spoiled little brat, since she is NOT. but putting in a suggestion to buy jackies cd and this cd seems like a good idea to me.<br />this is beautiful music sung by a beautiful entertainer.
B009KKLQKO|5.0|Really enjoyed it.  I would love to hear more... maybe a second vdv of the rest  of the concert that they did on tour!!!!!!
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|i love this app, but, i never opens, its just a black screen, then goes back to my apps, aka, doesnt open. i can only play it by unistalling, then reinstalling, and i lose all of my hard work
B0058YPGSY|5.0|since having no cable this is the best way to watch the show, no commericals {which I hate} and we can watch the entire series in one day, worried  about where season 5 goes, a little disappointed Jacks didn't get to escape.. but thats what makes the show!
B0059XTU1S|5.0|This is what happens when a classic work of fiction gets the attention to detail it deserves in a movie, because it is filled with lore from Middle Earth, enough to satisfy even a Tolkien nerd like myself.  Thankfully Jackson didn't follow the typical Hollywood paradigm of taking it &#34;to a whole new level&#34; with a sequel (technically a prequel in this case) because the story is smaller in scale than LOTR and should be that way.  From An Unexpected Party with the stirring song about the dwarven homeland, Bilbo's reluctance and sense of loss as he rushes out of his comfortable home without even a handkerchief.  The terrifying episode of Roast mutton as Bilbo begins to prove his worth against the Trolls to the titanic battle in the mountains followed by A Short Rest and the arrival at the last homely house.  All building up to Riddles in the Dark with the danger and creepiness of Gollum's cave coupled with the daring escape and finally the breathtaking cliffhanger of Out of the Frying-Pan into the Fire and a logical ending to Part One.<br /><br />It's difficult to go wrong when you've got a cast starring Ian McKellen returning as Gandalf the wandering wizard, supplemented with an excellent performance by Martin Freeman  as Bilbo Baggins as well as Richard Armitage playing Thorin Oakenshield not to mention Sylvester McCoy as Radaghast the Brown,  Cate Blanchett as Galadriel, Christopher Lee, Ian Holm and on and on.  Yes, the acting is superb and as with the LOTR series every character is cast to perfection truly bringing each character to life and I really have to say that nobody can do dwarves and elves like Jackson... It's as if he's found some secret notes from Tolkien that gives him special insight.  I was slightly disappointed that all the orcs are now CGI and the flight from the goblin king did approach being over-the-top at times but these are very minor complaints given how amazing this film is overall.<br /><br />Apparently, based on some negative reviews I've read, Peter Jackson is unable to live up to some people's expectations of absolute perfection, but for those of us lifelong fans of Tolkien, lovers of great cinema or anyone that enjoys being swept away by fantasy there is The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey.  :o)<br /><br />[Update: 3/18/13] TYSM Amazon for releasing this on Instant Video so ridiculously close to the end of its theatrical run. Lol, i think i've already watched it a couple times since I bought it & I honestly think I like this movie better than LOTR (blasphemy ikr). The included making of docs are so enjoyable and made me realize just how much of a labor of love this film was to Jackson and the entire cast & crew.I've read, Peter Jackson is unable to live up to some people's expectations of absolute perfection, but for those of us lifelong fans of Tolkien, lovers of great cinema or anyone that enjoys being swept away by fantasy there is The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey.  :o)<br /><br />[Update: 3/18/13] TYSM Amazon for releasing this on Instant Video so ridiculously close to the end of its theatrical run.

B000YENUI6|5.0|You can guess in the movie what's going on, because of his nice nature, but all in all a great movie, I enjoyed it very much
0307592731|3.0|I enjoy reading travel books and had never heard of the Pacific trail so I was very intrigued by this book. Most of the book was pretty enjoyable, however, it is written in the first person and contains material of an extremely feminine nature. I wouldn't recommend it to another man.
B000002MP2|5.0|Probably green days best cd! The actual cd and case came in excellent condition. I am extremely satisfied with it(:
B005LAIIQC|5.0|I'm a fan of the Bourne series.  This movie, the latest in the series, rivals the original Bourne Identity.  Love this product because you get the Blu-ray, DVD, Digital copy, and UltraViolet -- all at a competitive price.  Definitely recommend it.
B004X75RK4|1.0|I love Sandra Bullock and as usual she did a good job with this script. BUT! The PG-13 rating is sooooo wrong!<br />This movie is one immoral scene after another! Illicit sex, full nudity of both major actors, family cheering on illicit sex, disgusting male stripper, and on and on.  What a great disappointment.  It is not PG-13.  I would NEVER allow my 13 year old - or even my 17 year old - to watch this trashy movie.  Sandra is making bad choices in scripts for her middle-aged years. If you are sensitive about immorality in movies, avoid this one.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I am NOT a big TV viewer but a friend convinced me to start watching this series and I am SO glad she did!  I downloaded the season and watched it while I traveled, it's amazing how fast the wait time in the airport and the flights are when you are watching this!!!!!  I highly recommend!
0345803485|5.0|Very entertaining, easy read, kept my interest, some of the content very much outside my comfort zone.  I mind bend.

0385523394|4.0|&#34;Orange is the New Black&#34; is a riveting narrative of a woman's incarceration. Piper Kerman, as a prisoner, realistically portrays life in prison. The shock of moving from the &#34;high life&#34; to the &#34;low life&#34; so abruptly is evident in what she writes. It is fascinating to read how she gradually accommodated herself to such a wildly diverse population. Having been a volunteer, with my wife, in a woman's prison in Texas, I can speak with some degree of authority on this issue. The book would be profitably read by anyone facing the ugly specter of incarceration and it is true to how it is as an employee of the prison systerm as well as is for those who have daily custody responsibilities. However, Kerman's story makes good reading no matter from what perspective it is absorbed.<br /><br />Wesley Stevens

1400079276|5.0|Murakami is fearless with his mind, with his skill and with the reader. Though you know where this wacky and brilliant tale is headed from halfway through, it is hard to imagine how you will get there. He seems not content to keep things simple--his reveries about music and philosophy, for example, are not required, yet he enriches the novel with them. Shhhh! A master at work.
B001VNB54A|5.0|I watched the entire series, then ordered it for my Dad. It is so interesting and you really connect with the people and their stories.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This is another interesting story from John Grisham which is easy to read but never makes you to want and stop until the end..
B005LAII08|5.0|Fantastic my grand kids loved it!! Especially since they got to see it in the 3D version. Loved the expressions and reactions from them.
B0085P2Z6E|3.0|it's too touch sensative.  I can't move the screen around or pinch to enlarge/decrease without getting a &quot;random touch&quot;, ultimately being penalized for too many of them.  Fix this and it'll deserve 5 stars.
B00003CXXP|5.0|Great movie!! It really explores the meaning of humanity and what makes us humans..well human. Many think it's intelligence, only that make us human. The power to do as we like and what pleases us but in reality it is the mixture of intelligence and love. Very amazing movie with a powerful meaning! I remember watching it as a child and even then it got to me. Recommended for sure to those who can handle wise movies with hidden messages.
B004HW7JMO|4.0|Too bad we lost Andy Whitfield.  Dustin Clare and Whitfield made The Gods of the arena and Spartacus blood and sand.<br />The Spartacus Vengence does not have the panache,the exitement that the first two episodes provide.

B00992CF6W|5.0|Danged kid got me hooked on the Kindle Fire cuz his tablet only has the demo and I couldn't find where to buy it for him. The $6.99 price tag slowed me down initially but decided what the hey - it's an early Christmas present app. Who knew this 50yo grandmother would find herself hooked just looking the game over. Bought it just cuz my grandson said this way he could play the full tablet version and now I'm hooked.<br /><br />But I do have a question/problem that I'm wondering if anyone else has noticed. I'm playing the creative mode while learning and building my place and I keep finding myself flying even when I'm not trying and I can't stop flying. Even with what my grandson showed me failed. The only way to stop is to exit to the menu and then return to my game. A little aggravating so if anyone knows what I'm doing wrong and can help that'd be greatly appreciated. Overall, tho, I'm loving this!!
B008FPOIT6|4.0|I enjoyed this book. I wasn't sure where it was going when it started and at the end it was almost like the writer had to hurry up and finish. That being said, the story was interesting and it was hard to put down. It is a little different from stuff I have read before but, I enjoyed it.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|For being a freebie I have to admit to being somewhat unsure that I was getting something as nice as the reviews made it out to be but I have to admit I just played F&uuml;r Elise and had great fun with it. I can't play the piano although I've always enjoyed it and now I can play a lot of songs by following the note pattern.<br /><br />I don't quite have it all figured out as I'm not sure whether I'm supposed to hit the multiple keys that are green at the same time or not. If so then using my stylus isn't going to work if I want to REALLY have fun.<br /><br />But over all I'm having a great time playing the songs that are included.  There's a link for more songs but I haven't hit that yet as I expect you have to buy song collections which, I personally, don't have a problem with tho if you allow your children to play make sure you turn off your wifi or put your phone (if not playing on a Kindle Fire and soon to be the Kindle Fire HD which I look forward to seeing the differences between the 2 since I've owned the regular Fire since last Christmas :))  repeat in case I lost you on that quick side-tracked Christmas dream of mine, make sure you put your phone on airplane mode or whatever you need to do for other tablets which is probably similar to mine although I only have wifi not 3G or anything like that.<br /><br />Small town and limited to no 3G where I live so I'm not sure what you do for 3G but I'm sure those who have it know what to do.<br /><br />Minimal ads - I remember one for Google  something - sorry didn't pay close enough attention.

B008QTVNUI|5.0|Is he a terrorist or isn't he? Is she nut or isn't she? This show keeps you guessing all the way to the end. Well written, well acted, highly addictive. Start watching on a weekend because you won't want to stop at just one episode. Loved it!!
B008MEM24S|5.0|I purchased this app as soon as I knew it was out. It's great!! Levels are pretty hard but fun!!
B00785P2QC|3.0|its ok.  but I don't like it when games make you leave a review or like them or like them on facebook.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|We all saw this when it came out in the movie theatre, but enjoyed it even more at home.  Great for all ages!
1451627289|4.0|Great read, page turner... But so far seems to be a lot of useless story line. I would recommend this book, hopefully will make a great film someday too!

B007QPFGJW|3.0|I found that this book required that one read other books - like a college course's prerequisites.  I spent an inordinate amount of time paging back to identify characters that I would have known from previous books.  It made a good story a difficult slog.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|ok so I loved this game....at first!! so I was like level 42 and it was really fun! there where achievements and you could play with all your pony's in your ponyvill that you get. but then one random day the game deletes ALL my progress!! it starts me at level 1 again. I quite! -.-
145470246X|5.0|I have wanted to purchase some of Sabine's patterns on her web site. This is the perfect way to try her patterns for a great value. The instructions look to be very easy to follow. I have tried her free patterns from her web site and they were great. Her little stars bracelet is very nice. I adore her color choices and her designs are amazing. I want to try all of them! Thanks to Amazon for a great price! The designs are so romantic and capture your heart! Sigh...so many designs.....so little time! Buy the book, it is a great value!

B00A8Z6KN8|5.0|This cd is the perfect blend of dark and light hearted music. I do not typically enjoy soundtracks but this one is definitely worth the purchase, if you love The Hobbit or even Lord of the Rings the imagery that the music conjures is beautiful. And it is definitely encouraging if you are studying for an exam
B003Y5H54W|4.0|First of all, I loved the scenery!!  Snowy background contrasted with Red Riding Hood's red and black coat....  Eerie night full of suspense... Handsome man and beautiful girl...<br /><br />A movie doesn't have to be fantastic to be entertaining.  This movie starts out strong and ends strong.  At the end, you are wondering where the time went... Girls, grab your hot chocolate and your blankets (don't forget those smartphones!) and settle in for a night of good, clean fun!<br /><br />And you don't have to think much....but you have to pay attention!  Have fun and enjoy the show!!!

B0086700CM|5.0|I think it wasn't that hard to but once u get the hang of the game things become so much esier to do.
B003VR5PPY|5.0|First off, this is not your normal type of video game. It is more like an interactive novel. Don't let this keep you from playing the game, however. It has one of the finest stories, clever puzzles, and will keep you guessing until the very end. With several different endings, there is high re-playability; and thankfully you can skip over text you have already read from a previous play-through. Highly recommended to anyone who loves a good story and even to those who would &#34;like to play a game&#34; (if you get the reference).
0756666937|5.0|I purchased this book for my 11-year old friend who is a huge Lego fan.  He loves the book and insists on taking it with him for entertainment when they're going to be in the car for any length of time.
1439148953|5.0|Brooklyn: A Novel was a wonderful book.  It's the story of an Irish girl who moves to Brooklyn to find work, sponsored by an Irish-American priest.  I particularly liked how I was able to imagine the setting even through there were very few references to the era in which the story was set. It was an easy read, yet the author was able to make all the characters and the story come to life with just the right amount of detail.  Some reviewers were disappointed with the ending, but I wasn't.  I would love to know what happened to the characters after it ended, in this day and and age of sequels, but then again, the story was about an ordinary young lady who deals with a family emergency, but a familiar one, so I imagine her life would go on in a happily ordinary way.  Personally, I only wish the author had found some way to let the reader how how the main character's name was pronounced.
0399160450|5.0|This new series, which I suspect has quite a bit of input from the co-author, is starting to get better. Outside of a couple of annoying editorial mistakes ('Paris Island' instead of Perris Island' - c'mon guys!), I enjoyed this pageturner thoroughly.

B001NEK2GE|1.0|I bought this to play World of Warcraft and although it recognizes the game, and even my characters and their stats, it won't assign the keys, so it's useless.  I'll have to get in touch with Amazon to return it and get my money back. This is so disappointing for me, as I was so excited to have it. Sigh.
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|its a really good game but sometimes I cant make thirty good seconds on the thing before another ad pops up
B001BKTEZA|5.0|I'm sure you already know this book is set in the struggling Great Dust Bowl era.  What fun to be taken back to a time I've never lived in, and read such poetic descriptive language.  You rarely find anything like this in today's novel; imaginative and expressive in detail.

B000002KKD|5.0|I admit I got into the B-52's around '89 when Cosmic Thing came out. Loved that record so much (well, actually, i bought it on cassette). Then the inevitable happened, I had played Cosmic Thing out big time. Time to go find more B-52s, so I bought this album along with their sophmore effort, Wild Planet. This album is stronger than the aformentioned two releases. Best songs are: 6060842, Lava, Dance This Mess Around and the classic Rock Lobster.

B00000G3PA|4.0|...\\"Armageddon.\\"<br /><br />Lol, okay maybe it suffers from too much modern blockbuster syndrome, but I couldn't help thinking that 1998's \\"Armageddon\\" was the 1990's \\"2001: A Space Odyssey.\\" I visualize the sci-fi progression something like this:<br /><br />1968: \\"[[ASIN:B004L9GMBC 2001: A Space Odyssey]]\\"<br />1979: \\"[[ASIN:B000HZHBIM Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]\\" (which towers alone in the Trek franchise -- a profoundly spiritual TRIUMPH)<br />1986: \\"[[ASIN:B00012FXAE Aliens (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)]]\\"<br />1998: \\"Armageddon\\"<br /><br />Some might object that I omitted \\"[[ASIN:B000FQJAIW Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (Two-Disc Widescreen Enhanced and Original Theatrical Versions)]]\\" (1977), but it really doesn't fit the list. Don't get me wrong, it's excellent for what it is, but it's just too kid-oriented.<br /><br />In any event, I hated \\"Armageddon\\" in the late 90s and never cared to see it again. My dislike was a combination of the whole \\"blockbuster\\" syndrome with its fast-editing to please those with ADHD approach and, believe it or not, Roger Ebert's scathing denouncement, which illustrates the power of words.<br /><br />Well over a decade later I picked up a copy earlier this year (super-cheap) and finally viewed it a couple nights ago. Wow, was I entertained! Despite my dislike of fast-editing techniques, the story pulled me in right away and held me to the end. Yeah, some of the melodrama is too much, like Willis' scene with his daughter (Liv Tyler) near the end (rolling my eyes), but the filmmakers actually put some depth into the story and it mixes well with the action and humor. Their best move was to focus on character so that we knew and identified (with) the many individuals before the last hour's non-stop suspense and action kicked-in.<br /><br />Speaking of the humor, there are some laugh-out-loud lines, like the one on not paying taxes, ever.<br /><br />Furthermore, the star-studded cast is great and I especially appreciated the inclusion of Keith David and Michael Clarke Duncan (RIP).<br /><br />The film is rather long at 2 hours and 31 minutes (the DC adds two additional minutes), but the story maintains your attention and the suspense, action and F/X are literally senses-shattering.<br /><br />FINAL WORD: Yeah, it's a shameless, over-the-top \\"blockbuster,\\" but it tries so hard to entertain that you can't help but respect it. Besides, in addition to the disasters, action and humor, there's some actual depth to the characters and story. Take, for instance, Willis' character stumbling upon Affleck and Tyler during an intimate moment where Affleck literally covers her with kisses while she just eats it up. Willis stops, looks, and reconsiders his stubborn position. Then you know why he does what he does at the end.<br /><br />GRADE: B+ or A-nclusion of Keith David and Michael Clarke Duncan (RIP).<br /><br />The film is rather long at 2 hours and 31 minutes (the DC adds two additional minutes), but the story maintains your attention and the suspense, action and F/X are literally senses-shattering.<br /><br />FINAL WORD: Yeah, it's a shameless, over-the-top \\"blockbuster,\\" but it tries so hard to entertain that you can't help but respect it.

B005A1ER0I|5.0|If you are or are not new to epic (trailer) music and you do not have this release, you are doing a disservice to yourself! This is the release that all other releases should model. My all time favorite release in this genre, and not just this genre, but one of my all time favorites across the board. At times powerful, and other times very passionate! I'm one of those that can't live without music. I listen to many different genres but I connect closer to music that moves me. And this one does!! Don't hesitate to download this gem!!

0312370849|5.0|I am glad I read this book.  Another story of survival involving the holocaust.  It kept my attention and I was intrigued by Sarah's life story.
B004LWZWGA|3.0|The Dark Knight Rises is the 3rd and final film in the \\"Dark Knight Trilogy.\\" It ties up all the loose ends quite nicely but like the 2008 effort, it runs too long. Great things about this film are the narrative, the characters, the appearance of the bat cave and Tom Hardy's performance as Bane. That's it! The rest falls flat.<br /><br />This film is best described as an exercise in self-indulgence. Christopher Nolan fans have worshipped the man for years, exalting his modus operandi of gritty self-seriousness and faux gravitas without providing Nolan with the constructive criticism that he needs to grow and mature as a filmmaker. Due to the overzealous praise, Nolan's movies have been growing increasingly overlong and ponderous, and his ego has now reached critical mass with this third Batman adventure. Thus, instead of working to improve his directorial technique, Nolan stuck by his usual filmmaking chestnuts here, hoping to get away with bad pacing and pedestrian action scenes by smothering everything in relentless dramatic music and over-complicating a simple narrative to make people believe they're smart for understanding it. This is not to imply that The Dark Knight Rises is a terrible movie, however - it's just a severely flawed, tediously long-winded effort in need of discipline. While probably polished enough to satiate devoted fans, The Dark Knight Rises suffers from significant narrative and pacing issues.

B005I64U5C|5.0|This movie is so much fun. The video and sound quality are great. The biggest complaint I've heard about this movie is what Ryan Reynolds thinks up isn't that creative, but that's kinda the point. Just like in The Matrix how Neo couldn't necessarily believe 100%, If he made that Jump and immediately saw the code there would be no growth and it would be a short movie.

B008220C38|2.0|I normally love an art house style film. Not sure what the goal was with this latest film version of Anna Karenina. The idea of having much of the film take place on a stage just doesn't work. Several people at the showing I attended walked out. At other times there was open laughter.<br /><br />The biggest problem with the film is the casting. Aaron Taylor-Johnson is all wrong as Count Vronsky. Vronsky is a key role and Taylor-Johnson isn't manly enough to be believable. He seems much too high school boyish for Keira Knightley/Anna and frankly comes off as a gay character. In any film casting is key and Taylor-Johnson was a huge mistake. His hair style is 1970s modern and he has one of those goofy see through mustaches that too many 16 year old McDonalds workers have. At the screening I attended someone yelled out \\"sing YMCA!\\" when Taylor-Johnson came onscreen in a reference to his Village People look. The laughter was a welcome break.<br /><br />Jude Law was perfectly cast but his efforts seem wasted here.<br /><br />I had high hopes for this film. Sadly it was a terrible letdown. Great books often make great movies. This isn't one of them.

B005IFWXWU|5.0|For an Englishman, Mr. Laurie pulls it off, with a virtual who's who of co-conspirators. Different but fun, this album is full of sound and personality. From the brilliant piano licks to the unique percussion sounds, this music has life. If you are a bluesy-jazzy type of person, I highly recommend this compilation. I especially enjoyed Hugh's rendition of Swannee River.

B007V5CF5K|4.0|This is a very fun game. I enjoyed playing but....<br />  1. Kinda glitchy<br />  2. Kicked me out of the game and restarted my kindle fire once.<br />  3. Downloaded ok,  but when I opened the game it had to download resources and that took forever! Never had a game that needed to do that before.<br />  In spite of all that it was alot of fun to play and worth the buck I paid for it. It leaves you thinking there will be a second game and I hope so, just fix the couple of issues first please and it would be a 5 star game.<br /><br />  PS,  I wish the game lasted longer!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I was in between regular authors and I found this book well-liked and on the Amazon 100. I gave it a go and was not disappointed. Anyone who is a videogame fan and grew up in the 80s will take to this book right away and love it! This book is unique in that it took me back to my past, but also gives readers a glimpse into the future. Very well done and I can't wait for Armada when he puts it out next year! Hopefully the movie will come soon too.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Bruno Mars' latest album `Unorthodox Jukebox' is short and sweet. It's just 35 minutes long, but every song on it is strong.<br />\\"Unorthodox Jukebox\\" is a fitting title for the album because every song replicates classic pop, from the 50s to the 80s.<br /><br />Every song has a pure pop base, yet usually has strong R&B and soul elements.  The album is especially attractive to me because Mars often channels my favorite two artists - Michael Jackson and Prince.  Various New Wave to Motown to reggae influences are also here. On most of the album, Mars replicates the past with very little modern influence.<br /><br />My favorite track on the album is \\"Treasure\\". It's an upbeat pop-funk track you'd find on MJ's \\"Off The Wall\\" or Prince's \\"1999\\". If this was 1982 and I heard the song without knowing the artist, I'd think it was by a hot new artist. It's amazing how well Mars replicates the past.  The opening track \\"Young Girls\\" is the most modern-sounding pop track.  Is theme is that while girls can be a lot of fun, they can also spell trouble. \\"Gorilla\\", a brilliant late 80s-sounding pop track, has a similar theme. \\"Gorilla\\" is less lighthearted than \\"Young Girls\\". It's more reflective, and also deals with drugs and alcohol.<br /><br />The sex-soaked \\"Locked Out Of Heaven\\" fuses the New Wave sound with 50s pop-soul.  \\"When I Was You Man\\" is a late-70s Elton John-inspired power ballad. \\"Show Me\\" is 80s pop-reggae.  The closing track, \\"If I Knew\\", is homage to Motown.<br /><br />It should go without saying that Bruno Mars has great pipes and texture to his voice, so these well-produced tracks sound that much better. (4.25 out of 5 stars)<br /><br />--Isa R Bufano (12/14/12)

B00AOA53Q2|5.0|I was skeptical of how Glee would work this year, especially with the first few episodes. They were okay but not the punch that seasons before had been. I really enjoyed the episode about super heros, and finally the directors dedicated time to developing new characters to where I was looking forward to seeing them and wondering how they would progress. It has been excellent since then - I have to say that I have been pleased with seeing more of Darren Criss: Love the voice! The new characters all have great voices. I like that the series is incorporating new themes such as learning problems and weight issues - they are relevant to us today and certainly have opened up season 4 to something new. And the balance of graduated Glee kids to current high school students has progressed well after the first few episodes. I may have rated the season a 3+ at the beginning, but it is worth a five as we approach the middle of season 4. I am looking forward to seeing how the rest of the season plays out.

B008AK8FHM|1.0|I have read many books on this subject. I was disappointed in the book. Taking nothing away from the author's near death experience for me the book was more of a recollection of his medical condition and what his family went through while he was in a coma. I was expecting more about Heaven rather than a medical non fiction book.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Not as good as his others. I got a bit confused with the storyline. A bit hard to follow. Maybe it was just me.
B0023SDPS6|4.0|I bought this book because it was a kindle daily deal, and I really.enjoyed the TV show . After reading this book, I paid full price for every other book in the series, and I read them all back to back.  There is something about the characters and the location that just draws me in and makes me want to read more.  That kind of escapism is rare but well appreciated .
0316069434|3.0|I've read all of Connelly's books, but have started to feel a sense of fatigue in the overall tone of the books. Harry has slowly seemed to morph from a tough buck the system detective to a slightly cranky old man who beats himself up for being both a subpar father to a daughter who at least on paper seems pretty perfect, and a cop who is being dragged kicking and screaming into the modern technological age. The story of a cold case revolving around a foreign journalist killed during the LA riots follows all the right paths of your standard detective novel, and maybe that's part of what I was feeling as well. While quick to read, the sheer tension that has been ratcheted up in previous novels was missing here, and what's left is pretty average.
B000G6R7B8|5.0|As the title states, this is my second.  I wore the first watch everyday for a year and one day, but the last month it would speed up (gain time).  I would reset the time and less than an hour later it would gain ten or fifteen minutes.  After a day or so, it completely stopped.<br /><br />Why did I rate it five stars?<br /><br />The watch kept great time in the year I owned it.  The only time I had to reset it is when I washed the band and had to dry it overnight, as with all automatics, if one does not provide the motion to wind the watch, it will stop.  This watch took many hard bumps. At least twice my watch got snagged and the band separated from the case which resulted in the watch falling at least three feet onto concrete.  (The only damage was a few minor chips on the edge of the crystal and the case). The watch kept running on time.  Therefore,  I believe this watch is very durable.  Originally I purchased this watch through an outside vendor so the standard one year warranty (which for me did little as my watch was one day past the warranty period when it quit).  If I purchased this watch directly through Amazon, they (Amazon) extend that warranty to two years.  Whether the watch stopped because of the few drops it survived or a whether it truly was a mechanical flaw I do not know, but if I have it repaired, I will update this review with the findings.  Until then, I believe this watch is worthy of five stars and I should note that it outlasted every watch I've owned.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Calc+ free is very easy to use. The large numbers and sequence tracing help keep your mind on the job you are doing and not on pressing the right button.
B00013F38K|5.0|I absolutely loved this series.  I watched it every week, without fail.  I found this package of DVD's just as good as the series.  I just keep watching them over and over.
B009APMNB0|1.0|This device doesn't work at all with my new MacBook Pro.  I plugged it into my computer and nothing happened.  I ran the enclosed software program, but I got an error message saying that the device wasn't connected (even though it was).  I'm returning the thing for a refund.  What a huge waste of time.
B00ABGEFWC|1.0|Be sure you have the 'password protect purchases' function turned on before your child plays with this.  My daughter lost over 2 months of allowance buying tokens in this game.
B0007TKNIS|5.0|My wife ordered it and she loves it. I bought her a wind up music box with the monkey playing symbals too.
B00701897I|5.0|Great movie for the family, 3D images , sound , and characters with a lot scenes of adventure , my kids didn't  see in the cinema , but they were  stunned in home.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|This game rocks and you should get it. Great hidden object game ,I love the story and you have lots of ho. This game has a timer but they give you plenty of time to find the items.
B006P3HXZG|5.0|Recommended, great fun for every family , and enjoy the 3D effects and Hd images , funny characters , My kids love this movie
B005HSL626|3.0|this game is fun but it isn't a game that you want to play for hours at a time.I haughty it and play it a lot but it deffenently isn't my favorite. I like to play it only for a little because I get kind of board of it.I mean yes there are more than one challenges to play but they get boaring.
141659521X|5.0|As usual,Vince kept you interested where you didn't want to put this book down!!!! Thanks again Mr.Flynn,will be waiting for the next one
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is so fun!!!!!!!! There are so many fun levels and different challenges that you can play. It is so awesome!!!
B003GK22D4|2.0|I'm a fan of Ken Follet, but this book is not even close to his best ones. I don't recommend it.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|Good reading for about the last twenty five percent.  Not up to the author's usual penchant for keeping you up late at night.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|I had no idea what I was in for when I began this book.  The author`s imagined world didn`t seem so far fetched as I became part of the story.  The fact of witches, vampires and daemons co-existing with humans in the twenty-first century actually seemed normal.  There are things we don`t understand after all!  It was a great escape and I enjoyed the history.
0316067601|4.0|Now that I have the book, it is in a great condition, and I am looking forward to giving it as a present to my husband. Now I hope he is as excited as I am :)
B00785P2QC|4.0|das Spiel macht viel spass. ich kann das jedem empfehlen mal aus zu probieren. vor allem gefällt mir das es auch im schlaf Modi weiter läuft
B009PEKRY6|4.0|Bought this album for my daughter but find myself listening to it without her.  Enjoyable sound and likable voice.  Try it, you might like it.
B000JMKQX0|2.0|Once you get about 1/3 of the way into this book, you begin to think, &#34;ok, I get it&#34; and once you get it, there's not much more to get.  This book is like a great piece of work that an author would put together when establishing the backstory for a novel, but it is not itself a novel.  It is a large collection of very short stories told by different people about their experiences during the zombie apocalypse.  The reader does put pieces together to create the chain of events while reading, but that's about it.  There is no main character, except perhaps the interviewer, but he has no real voice in the book.  Perhaps the movie will be the story that this book sets up, but don't expect to read this book and then know what the movie will be about, because they will have to create a whole new tapestry from the pieces of cloth in this book in order to actually make a movie.
0345803485|4.0|So, I realize the last thing this book needs is another review and I'm way late to the bandwagon but since I finally succumbed to all the hype I figured I might as well give my fifty cents worth. And my hard line is; I liked it but it was weird.<br /><br />Maybe I'll start be describing why this was weird; Is there such a thing as YA erotica because that's what Fifty Shades reads like. The writing style is very simple and our main character Anastasia acts more like a high school heroine caught up in the big bad world of BDSM then a college grad. Yup she's way out of her depth here. This kinda makes sense when you're aware that this started out as Twilight fan fiction. I just wish I hadn't known this and I wish that James had edited a bit more before going to press because all the similarities distracted me. I've heard others mention that they didn't notice but I couldn't stop noticing and it removed me from the story as I pictured Jose as Jacob and every other character as their alter ego while stumbling around after clumsy Bella/Ana who all the boys seem to love despite her unremarkableness.<br /><br />Ana sigh she really is TSTL and I had a hard time believing that a gorgeous billionaire would fall for her; she's just been written a bit too immature, virginal and well, too much of a loser to be believable as Christian`s \\"It\\" girl -the moth to his flame. How the hell do you manage to graduate college without a computer anyway? (This relates to nothing but just bothered me)<br /><br />Speaking of Christian you can't help but fall for him, I mean who doesn't love a bad boy especially a gorgeous one with a disposable income and just enough issues to keep you interested. He and his Robert Pattinson-ish hair were very intriguing, hot and scary in a controlling stalker sort of way and I did like how his character and \\"fifty shades of f----d-upness\\" was slowly revealed throughout the book. Truthfully he is the sole reason I`ll be continuing on with this series, I have to find out why he is the way he is, what happened to him?<br /><br />I am curious to see what if anything EL James will write next, I would love to see where she goes on her own without the aid of the Twilight universe because she did have some great stuff here. Personally I think she would do really well with chick-lit, Ana's triple axel, back flipping, hiding behind the couch \\"Inner Goddess\\" really made me laugh but hopefully she'll set her next book in England because the Briticisms coming from Seattleite's were strange. I`ve never heard an American say pride of place. Anyways. I did enjoy all the emails; as well as being fun the characters finally got to show pieces of their true selves while still hiding behind the \\"mean machine\\" and a Blackberry. The 10 pages of contract rules and appendixes got to be a bit much, mostly because we kept referring back to them but it was interesting to see it laid out in full because it allowed you to think would I sign this? What would I amend? Cough, cough fisting.<br /><br />Despite all of my misgivings and issues in the end I liked this; I'm still not sure what all the fuss is about? I mean there is way better erotica out there but it was a fun read that I`ll be continuing with. Cheers<br />334jb4.5<br /><br />\\"I'm no longer angry with him, I feel suddenly, unbearably shy. I don't want him to go. For the first time, I'm wishing he was normal--wanting a normal relationship that doesn't need a ten-page agreement, a flogger, and carabineers in his playroom ceiling.\\"find out why he is the way he is, what happened to him?<br /><br />I am curious to see what if anything EL James will write next, I would love to see where she goes on her own without the aid of the Twilight universe because she did have some great stuff here.

B004VMUS9G|4.0|this is great app it wake's me up at 6am everyday and it gets pretty loud you should toatly get this app it is awsom I also Loki that it has a timer.but what I don't like is it drains your battery
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Ever go to middle school? Ever feel like the odd man out or last one picked? Ever feel like you've been punished for doing the right thing? You have to read this book - awesome! Finished within 24 hours... Only took that long because I had to put it down to go to work.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|This is a great game for beginners. The searches are not too difficult. I enjoy mystery games and this one my children were able to join in and have fun.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|I chose this book because of the negative reviews....writing style manic, tangential (I had to read it).  Ferriss' writing style is a bit tangential and quite earthy, but is quite informative.  I was interested in his theories of rapid learning and was partially attracted to the 4 hour chef because Amazon was offering a lower price on this book.  The book actually can be divided into 4-5 sections (prinicples of meta-learning, cuisine training, survival/ outdoor skills, the slow-carb diet, and the science of food.  In the process of giving a step-by-step intro on everything from basic culinary skills to how to skin a squirrel (really!), Ferriss transitions into some fascinating alleys (opinions on which gun or knife to purchase, vignettes on top culinary artists and restauranteurs, dietary advise) and simultaneously presents it with levity.  As previous critiques have stated, many of the ingredients are not readily available in smaller communities; nonetheless, the instructions are clear-cut and can be adopted to more routine foods (e.g. after a recipe for lamb shanks he produces an alternative using chuck roast to highlight the same  skill.  While at times the book did read like a gastronomic Godel, Escher, Bach..it is an enjoyable read, does not necessarily need to be read in order (I enjoy jumping around topics) and can be a how-to book if you want to develop some cooking skills.
B002VPE1WK|1.0|Well I got this bag about 2 weeks ago, and it seemed great at first all of my equipment fit perfectly, was a little heavy because of the Camera and 6 Lens, but that is what's to be expected so I thought then I started to notice the Top Carrying strap starting to Fray, along with one of the Carrying Straps. I am guessing its from the weight of the items inside and trying to carry it from the top and not wearing it as a backpack? I thought that this was a good step up from my Lowepro,sling back but I am starting to think wrong? but I do like the fact that everything fits inside very Nicely, and this bag looks exactly like the Canon Bag, I wonder if it Has the Same Problems with the Stitching coming apart at the seams do to weight? So my search for a strong bag at a fair Price continues...well the top lift ring finally came off, looks a hot mess now, so I cut the other side of the lift ring off to make it look decent, just waiting to see what else will go wrong with this bag next?
B005ZO6NRA|5.0|Real action packed..always loved mid-evil settings, with a touch of mystical. Good setting and nice graphics, and of course , a proper ending :-)
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much. I had to abandon my usual realist approach to love which was a fun exercise for me. I enjoyed the sex and how the writer described it in a creative manner leaving some things to interpretation. I read it on a plane and I found myself immersed and at times aroused! It was a &#34;let yourself go into fairytale land&#34; type of book and just what I needed.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Worth the bucks! Complete information and quite enough for a frequent traveller like me. Better with more cute and colourful design in the next version!
B001B68XRY|5.0|This is a great movie and made it on my 15 year olds wish list.  Can't go wrong with Sandler
B004KKX80A|5.0|is a very strong product my some love it. its stable and very fast, i just enjoy at the time my child play whit his bayblades.
B003L77G06|4.0|This is a Christmas gift that I will get to enjoy too.<br />Great cast - have enjoyed seeing the kids grow-up.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|still has plenty of plot twists to keep your interested and covering your eyes every now and then. can't wait for more!!
1401937519|3.0|Her story is very inspirational and will be of spiritual benefit to many readers. I don't agree with some of her conclusions but that would be theological nitpicking on my part and are not really worth going into. It is certainly worth reading, especially for those people who are looking for insights into what we might undergo when we die. It is interesting that during her near death experience she does not experience what many others have reported. That is not meant to imply, in any way, that her experience is inauthentic.
B00AE6SS5O|4.0|This game was too cute!  I was amused by some of the twists in the plot.  Those twists added to the light-hearted subject of the game.  The only reason it earned 4stars because some of the objects were substantially covered by the border graphics.  I have played it by myself and with my students all hovered around my fire.  Their only complaint was there was too much reading, I always play my games with the sound off.  Any way this game is played I would recommend it to both adults and children.  Well done ladies and gentlemen!  Keep the games coming.
B000A2XC1C|5.0|The DVD was here shortly after I ordered it and it worked perfectly! It's a great movie from my childhood and I was so happy to find it on DVD!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great series.  I enjoyed reading all the books.  I could hardly put the books down would recommend it to my friends.
B000AGTPUK|1.0|The very first time we played it, it got stuck in several spots and would not continue the movie until we skipped the entire chapter.  We missed a quarter of the movie, as a result!  We ended up throwing it away and buying a new copy at the store.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Last Man by Vince Flynn<br />Flynn is back!  I thought this was the best Rapp book in the last few.  Lots of action!  Relevant to what is going on today.  Keeping writing!!
0307895475|5.0|This book and attachments which came with it, was just what I needed for starting the game, Excellent. Will give me plenty of ideas.
B000683VI4|5.0|Want to watch a movie that is freaking awesome and touches your heart?  Watch this movie.  It makes me smile a lot and cry, but in a good way.  You must own this movie.
B008OJ291W|5.0|What a gift from Jeff Lynne!!!!<br /><br />What other artist loves his fans and music enough to spend the time and effort to go back and rerecord and engineer our favorite recordings?  I have followed ELO since 1974 and this recording is a must have!
B002DJSBMA|5.0|I love this movie for so many different reasons.  It makes me laugh and cry and just feel overwhelmed with emotion.  Great acting by the main three actors.
B009B0L324|5.0|I am not always crazy about live, but i do like this one. It has an excellent sampling of the music available.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|This Batman trilogy is on par with other great movie trilogies, like (the original) Star Wars, Indiana Jones and Back to the Future!
B009HEJXFS|5.0|Thought this was a great movie, the best MIB since the first. Had you sitting on your seat with the unexpected twist at the end.
B009FB3XTA|5.0|Another great Twilight soundtrack.  Each one has improved upon itself.  The only not awesome song is probably the one from Green Day...it just sounds so played and not up to their standards.  Otherwise, I really like the cd.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love to play Bingo and can stay home all wrapped up in my blanket this winter and play.<br />I like going to the different locations to play.<br />Sometimes I can't get the bingo to register but usually it does if I win.  Lots of times I wait for a number in several places and still don't win, but that's how it works at a real Bingo also.  I usually play till all my Bs are gone.  It was a long time before I realized that the Power Ups were there to be used that makes it real fun.<br />I will tell my Bingo friends about this game.
B005LAIHY0|2.0|I watched this movie twice in the cinemas and bought the Blu-ray disc. I really enjoyed the movie. But the gimmick included with the disc was extremely unsatisfying. I am fine if the disc does not come with digital copy. I am also find if it comes with only Ultraviolet (btw, I hate this concept!!!). But if you advertise it comes with digital copy please make sure the redemption code works! I got the first delivery and the code was invalid. Amazon was kind enough to send me a replacement disc free of charge BUT again the redemption code for the digital copy was invalid. How lucky am I to get 2 defective manufactures! Although I hate Ultraviolet, I gave it a shot and guess what - BOTH REDEMPTION CODES WORKED!!! Is this an attempt by the disc manufacturer to ...... forget it! Just disappointing.
B003O86FMW|3.0|i am a HUGE fan of this trilogy but Catching Fire was by far the weakest book out of the three.
B000VLE3GA|5.0|CLassic music at its best.  If you like the band then this is the album for you.  It could have a few more of there songs as the CD leaves you wanting for more
B004VYYA2K|4.0|Will be getting another one of these for my other grandchild.  Barbies are everywhere, this keeps them together and<br />also serves as a play area.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|The third movie in the MIB series is what you might expect.  More of the same humor and effects as the previous movies.  This latest installment has time travel (without any real paradox or confusing plot turns), hot pursuit, and tongue in cheek humor.  It is well worth watching and can be enjoyed by the entire family.
B0067R0APK|3.0|If there is a weather warning for your area a cute little warning triangle shows next to the day, but unlike NWS sites, there is no way to view the warning.
B0092C2X7U|5.0|friggen awesome game it is so good and fun it is fun with all its types of flips and all the maps
B0087JTAKW|3.0|The book promoted thinking about what living means, but the story took long to unfold and the early part was a little drawn out.
0446581348|4.0|This book has some amazing tips and tricks. I will say the one dislike I have is that there is some parts where is sounds a bit redundant. Other than that a great buy and I'm happy with my purchase.
B001NXDIMK|5.0|Glenn Close is at her best on this series. I love her character. She is no joke in this series. a female J.R. Ewing!
B008602KQI|5.0|Shipped fast. Packaging was great. The movie itself is pretty good, though I honestly only watched it because my wife wanted to. I've seen worse movies.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I haven't got it yet but it looks really cute and adorable. I seriously, seriously love LPS so I am looking forward to getting it. My favorite one out of mine is my curly tail cat. Plus, I am looking forward to going to Salt Lake or Provo, both in Utah to get more LPS. Sorry my review is so long, though. BYE!!!!!!!!
B000N2HBSO|4.0|I am fascinated with Abraham Lincoln.  He was one of our greatest presidents.  Doris Kearns Goodwin is a great presidential historian.  The book should be fascinating.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|How good is this movie, I saw it in the theater and I got it when it came out on DVD. I put it in my top 10 for sure !
B0097VS7ZS|1.0|when coloring you have to be very precise not good for adults or kids. my grandson could not use it at all.
B005LAIHPE|1.0|I wish I could rate it, but when I tried to play it the sound just cut off. I haven't got around to sending it back.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love this app....waking up to &quot;Rooster Alarm &quot; each time I have to use an alarm brings me back to my childhood when I actually woke up to the real thing....I love the convenience of it as well..Thanks!!!!!!!!!
1426308469|5.0|In reading some of this there were dinosaurs I had never heard of.  Think I will read it before giving it.
6305657947|5.0|I never saw the Steve McQueen version but my ex girlfriend was into this movie and that's where I saw it for the first time.  The movie was good but my girlfriend wasn't so that's why she's my ex!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Xxxxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx x xx xxx xxx xxx xx xx xxxxx xxxxxx xxxxc  xxxx xxxx xxx xxxx xx xx
B00001OH1S|5.0|When I bought this it was for my girlfriend at the time.  She's now an ex girlfriend but the music was good.  She wasn't and that's why she's my ex!
0307455874|5.0|its more interesting to know some part of the live of the president of the principal country of the world.
0694526088|5.0|This is a great motivational CD.  If you have a small business or plan on going into business for yourself this is a must!
B0079R8KO0|3.0|This cover fits the Kindle well.  The stand works will also.  The only Issue I have with the case is it is thin and feels week.  It is made out of a thin fake leather material, which does not really even look like leather.  Fresh out of the box, I would give this product 4.5 stars, but looking down the road, do to the cheap material used I see the I feel like the cost is about $10 to high.  For that reason I give it 3 starts.<br /><br />Hope this helps someone.
B009X01C64|5.0|I will make this short and sweet.  This case/stand is absolutely incredible IMHO.  The &#34;holder&#34; for the Kindle rotates 180 degrees allowing you to position as you want, and the hand strap inside the cover allows you to hold the case in portrait mode and turn the kindle to landscape mode for hand held movie watching (or whatever).  My only complaint is that I have larger hands and the strap could be a bit bigger, but it works great.  The cover is nice and soft; the attached elastic strap keeps the cover closed when not in use or keeps the cover from flopping when holding/using the Kindle.
B007TMON8M|4.0|I don't think I can say anything negative about this app.  It is fun to play and can be a challenge!  The leader board aspect is cool as well since you can see how well other people did and then compare your build to be better.<br /><br />On that aspect some people can compete levels with amazing ability, and I think that most if it is a flaw in the game design.  But none the less it is fun to play and see how much money it takes you to protect the dummy!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Better than \\"Bared to you\\", with a good story plot and enough steamy scenes. Can't wait for the next one!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game will eat up your time! The best part of the game is that even tho you can spend real money on coin to up items and upgrades in the game, you are not required too.  This is a distance game so you can see how far you can get in a single run.  The longer you go the more challenging the game gets.  You can do this over and over to save the coins you earn and buy the awesome upgrades.<br /><br />I don't have a single negative item I can think of for this game.  No NEED to spend money to advance, plus simple controls and fun game play make this a clear winner for mobile games!
B002WY65VU|4.0|I wish that there were more Woody Harrelson movies! But, honestly, now, I really don't remember the movie. We were laughing out loud at the absurdity, at the time.
B007TML4EI|4.0|I don't think I can say anything negative about this app.  It is fun to play and can be a challenge!

B0085P2Z6E|4.0|so far its shown great potential. some things are difficult to click on though. very fun otherwise. i highly recommend.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|some of the objects are outside of frame your working in and you have to use hint just to find it. Otherwise its a good game.
B00005JA8B|5.0|I am very happy with how fast this came in the mail. There were no problems with it, I am giving it as a gift. 5 out of 5 stars for sure.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great app. I use it when balancing my checkbook and writing bills. Large display is easy to see. I especially like how the calculator shows my history. Easy to verify my input. Highly recommend.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|love this game. really good g5 game. the story wasn't annoying like some can be. its a little expensive but worth it
B008JGSM6G|4.0|It was fun going through all the games.  Once through is enough for me, I hope it keeps the mind sharp.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is really interactive and is a lot of fun. I play this game with the little girl I babysit for and she absolutely loves it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|first of all, I LOVE this game. I like building, playing with friends, survival, everything. I know everyone thinks that the computer and xbox version are better, and I totally agree, but this version is still pretty cool, especially with all the updates. Now, to answer the person's update question: I have it on the kindle fire, so sometimes when I connect to wifi I get a notification saying that a new update is available, and usually it's minecraft, and I just click update. Maybe it's the same for your device and you just didn't notice, I don't know.
030745455X|5.0|Was the second book of a series of three. Excellent! More intrigue, suspense and weird characters! I couldn't wait until the third book!
0684824906|5.0|Highly recommend this engaging book. The bio elaboration on: Lincoln and the leaders/personalities in this era, their friendships, vision, struggles provides a comprehensive backstory to the issues, politics that preminate today.
0307454541|5.0|When I finally got into this,book, I loved it! Lots of detail and,suspense and odd characters . Very well written . Couldn't wait until the  second book to find out more!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|big screen with big buttons, sure beats the calc on my cell. . . . .  . . .. . .
030726999X|5.0|Wonderful and final book of a trilogy! It was great right up to the end and not predictable. I was actually sorry this was the last written by Stieg Larsson before he died . I'm not sure he felt as successful as he should have before he died. Great trilogy! Read them all and in order!
B0094BB4TW|3.0|nothing special compared to other fb apps. . . . . . .. . . . . . . . .
0399157565|5.0|I love her writing, sense of humor and plots! Patricia Cornwell is one of my favorite authors and I have read all of her books! This one will not disappoint !!
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|you finish all of the puzzles, after the puzzles are all done their isnt anything to look forward too at all
B000I0QL82|2.0|This movie's main draw is, it was the movie that the song White Christmas was first introduced in. It has a disjointed story line, and is poorly written, but is saved to some degree with Irving Berlin's music. It is in Black and White, which too bad because it would have been better in color, but they didn't make many color movies at the time. Murder mysteries are often better in B & W as it adds dramatic effect, but this is a fluff movie and color would have helped. My recommendation is to pass on this one and buy White Christmas, which is a very good movie.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This solitaire has every feature you need to play a good solid game.  I like the option to use multiple suits. Love it!
B003INBNXO|4.0|If you're looking for a great martial arts film, it's unlikely you'll be disappointed with this one. A friend recommended it to me after I mentioned how much I liked Raid: The Redemption. In Ip Man, Donnie Yen plays Ip, a martial arts master that refuses to open a school until the Japanese take over the city. When thugs begin to harass and rob the employees of a factory that belongs to his brother-in-law, Ip teaches the staff how to defend themselves and is ultimately invited to fight against Japanese martial artists for sport against Japanese fighters. The winner receives rice. Ip initially refuses, but when his close friend beats the Japanese in the ring and is subsequently  murdered, he decides to go in an effort to find out what happened.<br /><br />The film is well-written and well-directed. It starts a little slow, but the characters are set up well, including Ip's wife who begins the film disgruntled about how much time Ip spends practicing his martial arts with others while his young son feels neglected. The fight scenes are well shot and well choreographed, even though I find them a bit too stylized and prefer those in The Raid: Redemption. Donnie Yen does a wonderful job playing the character of Ip Man. The Japanese characters are a bit stereotyped and flat, but it's not enough to pull you out of the movie.

Many tasty and healthy uses for vegetables that I wasn't aware of, with many pictures and a great quality cover.    It's at my kitchen table at all times, good for getting inspiration.
B005LAII8K|4.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />\\".. I saw a mom who would die for her son, a man who would kill for his wife, a boy, angry and alone, laid out in front of him the bad path. I saw it and the path was a circle, round and round...\\"<br /><br />I wanted to see \\"Looper\\" (2012) written/directed by Rian Johnson as soon as I read the first reviews about it. It intrigued me for several reasons. The critics and viewers praised it. The first two Johnson's films were interesting and original and I wanted to see his new work. I am a fan of the time travel genre. Where else does the hero sit at a table in a roadside diner facing himself, either thirty years older, or thirty years younger - depending on which side he is sitting? Or where else rather clich&eacute;d phrase \\"he was in a deadly conflict with himself\\" means just that? And more. What does a man feel at gun point, with himself holding the gun, either thirty years older, or thirty years younger?<br /><br />Another reason for me was Joseph Gordon-Levitt as the main character Joe, the looper. He is a convincing versatile young actor, one of the most interesting of his generation. For Rian Johnson, Gordon-Levitt is kind of mascot. Johnson made all three movies with him, and Joseph was a leading man in two. An interesting feature of Gordon-Levitt's role (Joe \\"closes the loops of time\\" working as an assassin for the Mafia) is how he based Joe on young Bruce Willis. He plays young Willis' on- screen tough guy persona that we so get used to identify with and root for, and he does it very good. Bruce Willis also plays an important role of aged Joe. If you guessed that Willis would be saving the world that got into a serious trouble you may be right. This is what Willis does in the movie well: saves lost children, city, country, planet, and the universe. In \\"Looper\\" Willis plays retired hit man, whom his crime bosses sent with a bag on his head from the future, 2074 to the past 2044, to get rid of him with no trace. What happens to him when he arrives to the past, who meets him, how will he try to change the past to save the future - it's all in the loop, tied by Rian Johnson.<br /><br />By Johnson's words, despite the fact that \\"Looper\\" was a time travel film, he was more interested in creating the human characters, in choices they make in a situation that was caused by travel from future to past. This film is about making difficult choice, the possibility of one person to change the course of history, and how far he'd go for it. Dedicated to the paradox of time, \\"Looper\\" mixes futuristic science fiction and dark noir known for biting dialogue and off-screen sharp voice in Humphrey Bogart's movies style. Johnson adds the stories of love, not the least the love between a child and his mother. As befits a film about the possibility of time travel, the focus centers on whether it is possible, knowing exactly how the future will turn, to change something fundamentally important in the past, to correct it, and how this change will affect the lives of everyone involved. It would seem that nothing new, original and exciting can come out of the time travel genre after Terminator 1 and 2, 12 Monkeys, The Butterfly Effect, and their granddaddy, Le Jetee that started them all? But Johnson did it and even without a big budget, not trying to make a future in his film looking like a futuristic super modern giant metropolis. On the contrary, not so far removed future of 2044 looks more like the abandoned and gloomy suburbs of big city, shaken to its foundations by deep economic crisis, where the power is already in the hands of large criminal groups that control the time travel and use it to effectively get rid of the enemies sent from the future.<br /><br />Using the elements of the time travel genre, Looper goes beyond the borders. It asked interesting questions, and gave different answers. Rian Johnson, writer/ director, does not mind to break the rules of genres in his films. His films are more of stylizations, pastiches of genres he likes and interested in. The elements of genres are the building blocks, the bricks for him which he makes his films from. No wonder, his first film was called \\"Brick\\" (2005).<br /><br />To create a smart, interesting, original stylization, a game of mind - is not an easy task, and Johnson has the gift for it. His first two films, \\"Brick\\" and \\"The Brothers Bloom\\", were both intelligent, curious, but, rather, cerebral variations of films and books that Johnson likes. \\"Looper\\", his third, is also clever and gripping but what makes it the best of three, it's got heart in the right place. \\"Looper\\" affected me on a deep emotional level. \\"Looper\\", in my opinion is one of the best independent American movies of 2012. Being an independent filmmaker, Johnson is able to assert his creative ideas, but without super-budget. But I am glad that \\"Looper\\" did not look flashy and glamorous. It is more than just an eye-candy. It has a plot, intrigue, and the loop that it will close in a truly original, searing manner. While closing this loop, the film will answer the most important question - can you destroy the source of evil, which will bring tragedy and death to the future, if you look at it right now, this minute and \\"you see it. You see a mom who would die for her son, a man who would kill for his wife, a boy, angry & alone, laid out in front of him the bad path. You see it and the path is a circle, round and round...\\" Would you change it?e more of stylizations, pastiches of genres he likes and interested in.

B008KW43TE|5.0|I didn't know what to expect going in to this album. I saw him on SNL and he was good and Amazon had it on sale so I figured I might as well. I am so glad I did as this has turned out to be my favorite album all year and has been in constant rotation since.<br /><br />It's best listened to from beginning to end and manages somehow to be both flip and poignant but is at its best when beautifully describing some of the least beautiful moments in life. Love love love this.

B002Q1YDLI|4.0|This author's style of writing is fluent. I enjoy all of her books- have read 4 and have 2 more to go. She has a way of making you re-evaluate your feelings towards a character.

B007IXWKUK|4.0|Loved the second book as well. The first one was a little more shocking so this was a little easier for me to get through- as there was more story going on. I enjoyed it and recommend all three.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|{my thoughts} - This book was rather difficult for me to read. I had problems getting into it from the beginning and I didn't care much for the 180 all the characters took in terms of attitudes. It was more annoying as opposed to delightful.<br /><br />{part one} - I have to admit first that I have lost interest in this book. It seems to dragging on and on. With that said it is time to explore the aftermath of the result of the last book. A lot of what is taking place is rather predictable now which makes it difficult to want to keep reading. Anyways: onward I shall read.<br /><br />{part two} - Well this part started with a nice nifty surprise. I have to say it moved along a little faster then the first part did and it wasn't as hard to read through. But I will admit it still didn't have my undivided attention. This parts focus is on moving forward, not being trapped in the past, allowing your feelings to show and standing up for what you believe in. And it ends with a little surprise as well. All and all it was an alright read.<br /><br />{part three} - I honestly didn't know what to expect in this part. Katniss proves that her thoughts can be tainted by those around her and she shows a lack in defiance against the government after the government makes her lose so many people that are near and dear to her heart.<br /><br />{reason for reading} - Everyone else seemed to be so I jumped on the wagon.
B003BW0CB6|4.0|I like the author's style of writing. He writes legal thrillers- my favorite book type. I can relate with his characters as they are extremely likeable. The good guys win, the bad guys get their justice in the end. I like the Mickey Haller series. I loved &#34;The Lincoln Lawyer&#34; and this book kept the momentum going.
B000FA5TTW|1.0|{my thoughts} - I must confess I watched the movie before I had read the book. The movie left me in a daze slightly confused as to what was actually being portrayed. I read the book in order to try and straighten out that confusion I had been left with. The book helped to create the imagery that I was not getting from the movie. It also gave me whole story aside from the bits and pieces that were put together in the movie. All and all I would have rather read the book and skipped the movie. It's a really nice read and it paints and interesting picture of what Heaven may possibly look like. It also shows that with a little determination and investigation it is possible to solve a murder.<br /><br />{reason for reading} - I had watched the movie and didn't understand it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Her series is amazing, they are all page turners. I have recommended this book to many and the reviews have all been the same- awesome. I look forward to the movie coming out next year!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|\\"The rules of the Hunger Games are simple. In punishment for the uprising, each of the twelve districts must provide one girl and one boy, called tributes, to participate. The twenty-four tributes will be imprisoned in a vast outdoor arena that could hold anything from a burning desert to a frozen wasteland. Over the period of several weeks, the competitors must fight to the death. The last tribute standing wins,\\" {suzanne collins}.<br /><br />{my thoughts} - I really enjoyed this book for a number of reasons.<br /><br />{part one} - This book isn't what I had originally assumed even though I had gotten a lot of insight about it from a friend. It has in fact exceeded my expectations. It follows the journey of Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mallark as they are chosen as players {tributes} in the Hunger Games. They are from District 12 which is one of the poorest in the country and based on the description within the book it reminds me of the {great depression { only through a more futuristic type of stand point.<br /><br />{part two} - This part consisted of a lot of trial and error as well as some emotion. Along with all of that came a lot of destruction as well as death and determination to survive against all odds. The players within the arena have learned that the quickest way to eliminate some of the other players is by joining forces and then eliminating their allies when they are no longer of any use. This part ended with a new rule being announced that added a nice twist to the storyline.<br /><br />{part three} - The end of the book which was based on survival and cunning manipulation in my honest opinion. It also embarks on the journey of rebellion towards the Capitol that is in charge of these Hunger Games which shows that it is possible to \\"stick it to the man\\" if you have enough determination and the cunning ability to outsmart them.<br /><br />In the end the characters had out smarted the government in which I believe to be completely justified given that I view the Hunger Games as Barbaric and unnecessary evil. I understand the government's desire to show that they are still in control and can still force it's citizens to bend at their beckon call but I don't believe that brutal murder between teenagers as a form of entertainment is worth the risk of another up-rise within the districts against the Capitol.<br /><br />{reason for reading} - Everyone was talking about it so I had to see what all the hype was about.view the Hunger Games as Barbaric and unnecessary evil.

B0027MJU00|3.0|I loved &#34;Girl Gone&#34; and look forward to the movie. I felt compelled to order this book as well. I was not happy with the mention of hurting animals. I feel that could have been omitted. I realize this is a dark book, but that was unnecessary.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|{my thoughts} - I have this neat little habit of not completely reading a books description before I decide if I want to read it. I do this so that the story can pull me in and not the description which in some cases with some books has completely torn me away from the desire to read them. This book was amazing that's for sure and I can understand Hannah's view on life.<br /><br />This book is about teenage suicide. Hannah Baker kills herself by Overdosing on non-specified pills. When she finally decides it's what she wants to do she goes about making a list of all the people that brought her to her decision. All the people that had made her feel like life was no longer worth living. All the people that had wronged her. Once she makes that list then she goes about making tape records for each of these people to listen to once she's gone. She wants everyone to know what they did to her and how they helped shape the choice she made to end her life.<br /><br />I have to admit the way this story is written is a little odd. It took a bit to get use to reading what Clay (the person listening to the tapes) is saying in thoughts - where Hannah is talking on the tapes and then there are the in between conversations of Clay with others around him as well. Once you are able to follow the format it makes for a really nice read.<br /><br />{reason for reading} -  Like most other books I read, I read them because I heard about them and though it might be nice to read. In this case it turned out to be a really nice read for me. I had a really hard time putting it down!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|When I first started reading this book, I immediately knew I would have a problem- I could not put this book down! I did not think I would get caught up in the story but I was so wrong. It took me 5 days to read all three and that was after forfeiting much sleep. Definitely my favorite series of 2012.
B003O86FMW|5.0|{my thoguhts} - This book was full of twists and turns and not what I had expected. It shows that with a sound belief system anything is possible. It also shows that the government can be rather cruel in their ploys to stay in control. The ending surprised me but then it shouldn't have after I had read the contents of the first book.<br /><br />{part one} - I have to admit this series is something else. The first book ended so nicely and then this book picked up right where it had let off. Amazing is all I can say. Katniss is lost, the world she knew gone. Replaced by visions and thoughts that have been approved by the Capitol. It makes me feel bad for her reading about how she has no choice but to go along with what the Capitol wants in order to attempt to save the lives of those she loves. I got to hand it to her she's one determined girl that has the help and support of those she holds closest to her heart.<br /><br />{part two} - I cannot believe the twist that was thrown into this part of the book. It made me so sad to think of what the actual outcome may be like and to know that the more defiant the tributes are the less likely they are to survive in the end as the Capitol has a barbaric way dealing with even the smallest form of disrespect. The \\"Quarter Quell\\" {75th hunger games} has finally begun and with it comes a whole lot more twists and turns. I must admit however, that this part of the book is very sad at least to me - I am almost unsure about my desire to read the third part because I know that it can most certainly only get worse as opposed to better - but the story-line pulls me in and I am determined to find out what happens.<br /><br />{part three} - All I can say is wow. death, revenge, loyalty, the desire to survive, team work and so much more takes place inside this part. I am at awe of how well the characters play their parts. It is always nice to learn even more about the character's that you have come to love within a book it gives you a sense of longing to be there with them, to see firsthand what they are seeing and the imagery within the book allows you that ability - to be there and see it all from the point of view of the characters.<br /><br />{reason for reading} - It was recommended by a friend.se of longing to be there with them, to see firsthand what they are seeing and the imagery within the book allows you that ability - to be there and see it all from the point of view of the characters.<br /><br />{reason for reading} - It was recommended by a friend.

There is a competing products called XCM cross battle or crossfire that goes anywhere between 30 and 65 dollars with mic capability. This is not revolutionary but an overpriced thumb drive really isn't worth more than 15 dollars without mic.<br /><br />11/9/2013<br />** The device does not allow for the Xbox 360 controller to be played on ps3 With the latest firmware and software.

B009LDXQGW|5.0|I enjoyed having a physical copy of his songs, having them as official cds makes listening even better. I also loved the additional songs that he added. Just gave me more of him to listen to. The Weeknd has to be one of my favorite singers in this generation and I'm just happy to have something to remember him by. I've been listening to these songs over and over, although I already had the ones from his mixtapes already on my laptop. I would recommend The Trilogy to any true The Weeknd fan and to anyone else who wants to enjoy some great music. I was also very happy with the time in which the cd arrived, it arrived early like I was expecting it to.
B002XG1OUE|5.0|Awesome quality, and came sooner than expected! Great service and cant wait to order more from you in the future!!!
B004LTA6AU|5.0|Bob Marley has been a man I've admired ever since I heard one of his songs while I was in high school. He's a man I look up to, not for his affiliation with herbs, but because he was a man who was and is still is a legend. When I saw that this cd was on sale on here, I immediately put my order in for it and I'm happy I did. I found a couple new songs on here that I had yet to hear and those songs are now added to my favorites. No Woman, No Cry is even better when listening to it on this cd. Bob Marley could never disappoint me with any of his songs. I love having this cd in my small cd collection that I'm starting and I plan on buying more from this legendary man.
0307352145|4.0|While I haven't read this book, I'm interested. Our son-in-law of 15 years continually doesn't even say hello at family functions when entering the house or room. My husband, his father-inlaw, (73 years old) has continually been perplexed and had his feeling hurt by this son not saying hello...His wife, our daughter, has to tell him to say thank you (for dinner or gifts or babysitting...he has 5 children). He has become an outcast of the family because of his demeanor. He's a teacher of jr. high and a good one. I know he has some good intentions and attributes but his lack of simple cordiality is appalling as an adult. Sometimes this \\"shy-act\\" goes just a little too far! Yes, their certainly is power in introverts and I'm proud and happy to say our family is full of extroverts and strong personalities...at least we can say hello, goodbye and thank you! I've got to read this book...
B008CJ0KI8|5.0|I remember I pre-ordered this cd as soon as I found out it was available on here. I was surprised when it arrived in the mail because it came a day early. I listened to it as soon as I took it out of the package. There are a lot of favorites on this cd and I especially enjoyed that Frank included his coming out note that he had posted on his Tumblr. I applauded him for posting it there and I also applauded him for making a special one for his cd. Sweet Life, Pink Matter, Pyramids, and a few other songs have been on repeat since buying this cd. Frank is also one of the singers I really enjoy listening to and I could not be happier with this purchase!
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Great story written by a true hero about even bigger heroes. Makes you proud and reminds you what sacrifices are made to keep this country safe and help others live a better life.
1451695195|5.0|If you haven't already, pick this one up. Reads like a suspense novel and at the same time loads in the information you're waiting for. Includes a great reading list if you need one, and an appendix that walks you through a neurologist's examination of what might have physically caused the experience, and why it couldn't have.<br /><br />Obviously, I recommend this book. It is anything but a downer - intriguing doesn't begin to cover it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is one of the best apps i ever had it is very fun active and a game that will keep you going the whole day. i stayed up the whole day playing this and my battery was draining down so i had to charge it plenty of times. but overall it was a very good game. and i would definitly buy it if i was you but omly for free because i only buy free games!!!!!!!!
B0053O89YM|5.0|loved it.  I love this series.  Bought seasons 1 and 2.  Cant wait to buy season 4 when it comes out.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|I hadn't seen this movie in a while and forgot how funny it truly was.  The family is in complete agreement that this will be a new family tradition every year at Christmas time from now on.

B0042KZJ5K|5.0|I used to listen to the original soundtrack on a regular basis and I really enjoyed it, but this edition is even better than the original! It displays more of the feel of the movie and all the extra songs are great. If you loved the movie, you'll love this 2 disk set.
0142429112|5.0|I enjoyed this book immensely.  This is the best written book that I have read in the last couple of years...and the sequel was just as enjoyable and well written.  I couldn't give this book enough stars.
B0018LMZOO|5.0|This CD although not highlighted as one of the best banda certainly can not fail to be recognized. Songs are melodic with the right dose. In my opinion is among the best. The remastering is excellent. There is not one bad song. It's a good album for anyone who wants to know the band, there's no way waive the collection. Very good!
B000W7JWUA|5.0|For the family across the nation for their Christmas gift.  Haven't heard if they liked it or not. Is that ungrateful?
B001EBV0OY|5.0|This is the best movie eve!  Love it...and have watched it over and over again!  A must watch movie for everyone!
1451695195|4.0|A very interesting story, and really well written. I always enjoy true stories and this one was facinating. Gave me hope that being here is not so pointless after all!!
B001O1O71C|4.0|Very sad. Now parentsknowwhatits like to lose  a child.being Jewish, and having lost family in the holocaust, I feel the sadness for all.
B008I34YYY|5.0|OK, it really is a B movie. However, it is the best B movie I have ever seen! Interesting story, surprisingly good acting, and decent special effects. I suspect this may become a cult classic.
B008L1VZQI|4.0|Popular wisdom would have it that Verdi was not entirely at home in the genre of comic opera, and history more or less backs this up.  Un giorno di regno - the composer's second opera - was something of a failure when it was first performed and the reasons why are still evident.  There are elements that one would not associate with the typical Verdi opera (harpsichord-accompanied recitative!), but unfortunately, even the touches that are very much characteristic of the composer don't prove to be suitable for the comic melodrama.  A strong stage production and good singing at this very rare performance of Un giorno di regno at the Teatro Regio di Parma make this nonetheless a fascinating experience even if it can't quite go as far as rescuing the reputation of Verdi's early failure.<br /><br />There's not much one can do however about the fact that the comedy element of Un giorno di regno is really not that funny in the first place.  It's a standard comic set up of the romantic complications that arise from arranged marriage mismatches and secret or hidden identities of characters in disguise.  It's not a plot that is entirely bereft of comic potential.  Rossini had to make much out of thinner material than this, and Verdi seems to have at least learned that much from his predecessor, scoring with vigorous arrangements that build in tempo towards explosive ensemble finales.  Un giorno di regno lacks Rossini's lightness of touch, and what would be an amiably riotous situation in a Rossini opera, rises into a rousing bombastic declamation in Verdi's hands.  While it's fascinating to see just how Verdi develops those situations in his own distinctive way - particularly with a view to what comes later in the composer's career - they prove however to somewhat work against the comic potential.  The music is gorgeous and cleverly arranged, but it doesn't really establish the right kind of buffo tone that is required.<br /><br />Neither really does the stage direction.  Thebest thing you can say about Pier Luigi Pizzi's direction is that it is unobtrusive and doesn't draw attention to itself in any way that detracts from the musical drama.  It's generically opera period in design and costumes, with columns, bookcases and tables that reflect the mansion locations and gardens, and it's well arranged as far as putting figures into the right places and keeping the dramatic action flowing without too much standing around going on.  It doesn't however attempt to add anything to the comic situations that might enhance or even improve the weaknesses in Verdi's musical direction.  The stage direction gets the balance right to the extent that it flows along wonderfully without it ever jarring in any way, taking you along with the flow, but it's not particularly adventurous and this opera could use an injection of a little more humour.<br /><br />Fortunately, the singing is all-around terrific, giving as fine an account of the work as you could hope for.  The younger singers come over best, Alessandra Maranelli's sweet sounding mezzo-soprano and Ivan Magri's strong but lyrical Edoardo working well together, finding a good balance between the Verdi sound and the Rossinian.  The others however are just as good - Guido Loconsolo as Belfiore, Andrea Porta as Baron Kelbar, Anna Caterina Antonacci as the Marquise and Paolo Bordogna as La Rocca, all managing to bring a degree of character to their roles, singing well, working with each other and with the comic-timing of the piece.<br /><br />Un giorno di regno is the second release in the 'Tutto Verdi' series from C-Major, a collection that is made up of performances of all Verdi's opera work recorded at the Teatro Regio di Parma.  Some trailers for other works in the collection are included on the disc, as well as a visual introduction/synopsis for Un giorno di regno.  The quality of the HD image and sound - in PCM Stereo and DTS HD-Master Audio 5.1 - is marvellous.  The Blu-ray is all-region, with subtitles in Italian, English, German, French, Spanish, Chinese, Korean and Japanese.
B008VZAXAI|4.0|This movie was over hyped to me by someone as the most horrible thing they had ever seen and I had to see it.  It was a good movie but more at times I found myself getting mad at the characters for being so dumb.
0307592731|1.0|I'm sorry...I am very much in the minority, but...this book is a pathetic story about a pathetic young woman who is so self-absorbed that she is not able to see the reality of her situation.  Even if she hadn't 'lost' her mother, she would be adrift in the real world.  Yes, she does learn some things on her journey but her lack of understanding is monumental.  She is always on the lookout for her next 'sack-mate' at the expense of her soul's mending.  She reminded me of all the hippy-dippy dopers who floated from one experience to the next.  From the author's information of her life at present, it sounds like she made some break-throughs along the way.  That is good.  Because where she was in this book was not good.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised when I stumbled across this wonderful tv series. I am not a big tv watching person as far as network programming is concerned but I do enjoy great shows like Boardwalk Empire, The Wire, Law & Order,etc. This show is so captivating that you don't want it to end. The cats of characters and the different plots make this show a must see. I went back and watched the entire season one on Netflix and paid to view a few episodes of season 2 on Amazon. There are 5 episodes on Fios which I watched for free but with commercials. So now I have seen all of the episodes and can not wait for the next one. This is a must see if you like horror/thrillers which are not too Gorey.
B005OP7162|5.0|One of my fave tv shows, I occasionally miss an episode and am quite glad that Amazon has it available. As always, their videos are clear, crisp, and display very well on my TV via Roku.
B007SPN5MA|5.0|Sempre gostei dos trabalhos do Glen Hansard. Mas o seu primeiro CD solo superou qualquer expectativa. Não tenho muito o que dizer, todas as faixas são ótimas, o CD é o melhor do ano e, com certeza, um dos melhore discos que eu tenho. É um novo clássico!
B005KELW26|5.0|The Kindle cover is rugged and easy to put on. The only complaint I have is the magnetic tab is somewhat of a nuisance. I fold mine backwards and hook it to the cover when it is open. I am concerned that the tab may wear out to quickly with the constant folding back and forth. Otherwise, I really like the cover.
B009YU62H2|4.0|I &#60;3 Soundgard, they are my top favorite band next to LTJ.  I was so depressed back in HS when they broke up and I haven't been super happy with their re-release albums as of recently.  However I very much enjoy this album.  It does feel like they haven't worked together in over a decade but I really hope this record leads to more.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I have been trying literally ALL of the free spider solitaire games in the kindle app store over the last few days.  This is the absolute best.  It still has problems, but it is the best of the lot.<br /><br />Cons:  Unplayable cards in the back of the stack (the ones already turned up) look just like the others, they aren't grayed out or anything, so it is hard to tell where your runs start and end.  The &#34;undo&#34; button isn't just on the screen.  You have to select settings then undo, so it is two clicks instead of one, everytime!<br /><br />Pros:  The cards are large and take up the entire screen, unlike a lot of games where the graphics don't use the whole screen.  The graphics are crisp.  The deals are smooth and the animation isn't shaky.<br /><br />Again, I have played better versions of spider - but none of those are available for free on my kindle.  Of the choices, this is the best one!
B006O5Y75Y|5.0|I loved watching Planet of The Apes when I was a kid and I still like watching it. The story like is great the costumes are wonderful, and the set is outstanding. I don't usually watch repeats but I enjoy watching this a few times per year.
B005PZ85SO|4.0|One of my fave tv shows, I occasionally miss an episode and Criminal Minds is NOT available on cable or Netflix as yet, so despite the cost (my budget is VERY tight!) I am quite glad that Amazon DOES offer it. As always, their videos are clear, crisp, and display very well on my TV via Roku.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|My son loves Harry Potter & he loved this case containing all movies. Great value for the money paid, hours of fun!!
B004OCCFFI|3.0|Most will agree that Kaufmann has a fabulous way of singing this role. I even had the opportunity to hear him live some weeks ago at the Théâtre des Champs-Elysées, and went out immediately to buy this CD, just to have a souvenir of that impressive performance.<br />HOWEVER, although we normally expect wonderful things from Claudio Abbado, one of the most prestigious conductors of our time, here he falls so short of the goal, the shock intensifies the disappointment.  His interpretation is LIGHT, superficial, dry, and simply not Beethovien at all.  Compare the overture with the Germanic luster of Karajan's version, the difference is like night and day!  It is not entirely Abbado's fault, the recording engineers are also to blame: the positioning of the microphones makes it difficult to hear the timpani (so important in Beethoven's works!) and most destructively of all, the brass section is not as audible as it should be.  The majestic dissonance between the string section and brass section that one SHOULD hear at key points in the overture is completely lost in this recording.<br />Overall, if you are a big fan of Kaufmann or the other singers, buy this recording, otherwise opt for the far superior version of Karajan with Vickers, Donath, van Dam, etc in its remastered form.
B008KE3960|4.0|I got this the day it came out on both my Kindle Fire & Android phone.  It's been a lot of fun to play and very enjoyable.  The only minus is that your games only sync on the Kindle devices and not other Android devices.
B006CQLGXG|5.0|I have seen stage and film adaptations of this story over 40 times but never got down to reading the original work until this year.  A year will not pass from this one forward without re-reading this amazing story of human transformation and spiritual redemption.  A true classic in every sense.
B008G12ERC|2.0|I really don't like their last CDs, this one included. I wish I could have back the old Muse that just played fast guitar, bass and drums :o(
B009186JYI|5.0|This DVD shows us a journey undertaken by the Rolling Stones in their early careers. A chronological look at a couple concerts held in Ireland. We see the flight to Ireland and back again. and the step-by-step events while on this mini-tour. The original film has been restored and works well at a number of levels.<br /><br />What is charming about this film is the innocence of the Stones. They are captured before alcohol and drugs became so much a part of some of their lives. One thinks of the wonder in them that, at this point in time, they were still continuing, enjoying their work, and progressing in their careers. This is when the original Stones were honing their act--Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Brian Jones, Bill Wyman, and Charlie Watts. We get a glimpse of whom each one was.<br /><br />We get footage of two concerts. The first features \\"The Last Time\\" and \\"Time Is on My Side.\\" The audience goes wild and--then--some of them ran up to the stage and started holding onto or grabbing the musicians. Police entered and a mini-riot broke out, with the Rolling Stones skedaddling from the melee. The second concert features \\"Around and Around\\" and their first mega-hit--\\"Satisfaction.\\" It is fun to watch Jagger dancing, even then pretty fluid on stage.<br /><br />Highlights include reflections by the Stones (and their manager, Andrew Loog Oldham) in a room, Keith playing an acoustic guitar while Jagger sings in a room. There is something almost sweet about the portrayal of the musicians--they were not yet jaded. The cinema verite approach works nicely.<br /><br />For an \\"up close and personal\\" look at the Rolling Stones early in their careers, this is a fascinating film.
B005OCFHHK|4.0|I am not going to comment on the movies but will concentrate on the boxed set. If you are looking for the collector's edition this is NOT the item you are looking for. There is another collector's box available that you can get with all the bells and whistles. This box set, however, had what I needed. All the HP movies in blu-ray without any special features, extraneous bonus materials etc. The box that the movies come in is sturdy and the movies are protected well enough in the box. At first the box looked small to contain all the eight movies, but upon opening, they were not only all there but neatly packed into their cover. Overall I would rate this a good product if you are looking for just the movies in blu-ray. The packaging was nice and I got what I needed.

B005T87QCI|5.0|I love this game! I play it on KINDLE FIRE. It has superb graphics and game play. Apparently, the paid version is more challenging than the free version. In the free version (which I have not played), it's quite easy to play and to beat the other robots and many people then find the game boring. But they are in for a surprise when they play the paid version. It's almost too hard to play--even at the \\"easy\\" setting. I find even the \\"easy\\" setting challenging which may be due to the touch screen controls. I found that you need a real light touch on the screen or it wouldnt sense all of your touches to make it punch (and then your opponent would take quick advantage and pound you). Also, you need to time your punch combinations properly in order to win. If you throw wild punches, you're simply wasting power and that may cause your bot to drop his hands and you won't be able to block counter punches. It's important that you block your opponent's punches until he pauses and runs low on power, then you can throw your punches quickly and then cover up again. When throwing the \\"special\\" (which is a jab followed by the \\"special\\" button), your jab must make contact first before you should press the \\"special\\" button, otherwise, the pre-programmed punch combination won't work. You'll have only thrown 2 separate punches and not the pre-programmed \\"special\\" (a combination punch which scores you a lot of points).I love the pre-programmed combination punches (i.e. specials). I dont have any problem with the robots from the movie not being in the paid version of the game. I highly recommend this game! If you played the free version and liked it, then play the paid version, but be aware that you'll spend many hours just learning when to attack and how to time your punches (throws) just to get the pre-programmed punches to work. But when you win, it's very satisfying because it takes a lot of \\"training\\" to win. The opponents aren't pushovers. The game lists a few strategies that you need to read or you CAN'T win. GOOD LUCK!
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|It's an Intel.  I own 2 of these and an Ivy Bridge i7.  They are all great CPUs.  They work well and really move even under a load....I typically run my Windows 7 machine with 2 or 3 different VMs at the same time....I have no issues with any of the CPUs slowing me down.  Highly recommended.
B005EHILV4|5.0|I already have a digidesign mbox2 which works quite well. However, I wanted something a bit more portable, so I bought this mixer. I tried it at my home and it worked perfectly well. Then I took it to the office and tried it there and the recordings had a very noticeable hiss. In the office, I had created a brand new setup with a brand new Microphone and XLR cable. I was confused if the Microphone or the cable had a problem. I tried everything including trying to get drivers from Behringer's website but to no avail. I was about to give up but as a last ditch try, I unplugged it from the front USB ports of the computer and plugged it in the back USB port and VOILA! the hiss disappeared. Even with the gain turned up to about 60-70%, no hiss at all. That got me thinking. Not all USB ports are the same. USB ports have the ability to supply power to devices but not all USB ports are made to supply power. In case of the desktops, the front USB ports are usually meant to connect only to devices like USB keys which do not require much power. The rear ports however are directly connected to the motherboard and hence usually are the power supplying kind. Maybe, the front ports were simply not supplying enough juice to power this device properly.<br /><br />I wonder if folks who are having the issue with hiss should try a different powered USB port.<br /><br />Anyways, the device works beautifully and it is really portable. Fits in the palm of my hand. I am quite pleased with the purchase.
B003Y5H5HO|3.0|This is the movie of the first of a 3-book set.  The books are somewhat complicated as the story weaves between time periods and physical loactions with different sub-plots occuring simultaneously.  Had I not read the books, I'm not sure I would have been able to follow and understand the movie.  The acting and photography are excellent.  The movie closely follows the first book which causes it to bounce around in time and place.  Will a second and third film be produced for the remaining two books?  I am doubtful, but I hope so, even if it is a difficult story to follow.  It may be possible to get the videos of the original Swedish TV program of these books but with captioning.

B00A3NQNUU|4.0|Like it, crashes a lot on android, ok on kindle.  Fun to play but also frustrating when your try for 10 times to breed a certain dragon and they don't give it to you.  Especially on the Seasonal dragons and Gen stone dragons.  Hopefully they will be nicer for a xmas gift to the players!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Lots of fun -My grandson loved showing me how to play,  now he thinks it is funny when he &quot;has&quot; to help Gramma win! Great game for almost all ages!
B009E3EY38|3.0|The film is edited in a way that doesn't allow the viewer the opportunity to see the performance in a way that captures a true concert experience. You don't have the opportunity to emerge yourself into let say Page's guitar mastery. The quick editing contributes to an uneasiness and frustrating way to watch a live performance. . Video producers need to abandon the technical self-indulgent techniques and allow the musicians to emerge to show their talents and collaboration on stage. This was a \\"concert\\" not an MTV video.It is also obvious that the all that were involved in this production had very little knowledge of Led Zepplin. The music speaks for itself. I was fotunate to see this band in both small and large venues. I sat for 3 hours in the front row inside a tent for a 1969 performance. I can remember nearly the whole set they played. To conclude, 12-16 cameras is overkill. We are all getting to consumed by technology. It is taking us furthur away from the core of art and other media.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Great and inexpensive Blue Ray set of All of the Alien films. Comes in handsome box set that should please any fan. Loads of extras. Loved it.

B002ZG98FU|5.0|This product was in great shape and arrived quickly. I love Rachel McAdams and she's an interesting character in this movie.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|I liked this movie.  I liked it more than the previous movies, but then that's just me.<br /><br />The premise of this movie is the fall out.  It tracks what normally happens when top secret programs suddenly become public in the movies.  The Agencies seek to protect what they can, and burn the rest.  So This follows that premise.  If you are looking for the more detailed plots that the previous movies had, it's not in this movie.<br /><br />This movie is the establishment of the new character &#34;Aaron Cross&#34;, and following his journey through the burn.  Being that they plan on continuing the story line, you know the new character is going to survive.<br /><br />If you enjoy Jeremy Renner, you will most likely like this movie.  If you really liked the previous movies, you will either love or hate this movie, but only you can make that choice.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|Have enjoyed playing game so far ,quite interesting. A great challenge .Would buy next version.A lot different than i thought it would be.jim
B007XC9BSK|1.0|I bought it to my 5 years old kid.  We chose it together due to the  pictures showing many cars in the truck. We waited impatiently for its arrival (which was fast). But what a disappointment, a cheap plastic tiny truck (if I saw it in the store I wouldn't put more than 3$ on it) with no added cars, was in the pack.<br />This is a real misleading advertisement. My kid cried for hours. And the disrespect these guys have, a day later they send me a mail asking me to buy the additional cars......
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is well thought out. Survival and Creative mode are both amazing. It gives you plenty of supplies to build stuff in creative. You will not be disappointed with this app! It was totally worth $6.99.<br />.
B002PMPTIO|4.0|A fantastic movie giving a new spin on the classic Star Trek franchise.<br /><br />Mostly an action movie, and it makes much more sense if one has prior experience and knowledge with the Enterprise and her crew.
B005V1WYZC|5.0|I had already seen this movie and knew it was awesome. It's very funny and very touching. Product was in good shape.
B002KS1IJC|3.0|I wasn't sure I was going to enjoy the movie, but I wanted to see it because James Caviezel was in it, and I was going through a phase.<br /><br />Not his best, you might enjoy it, if you don't mind the B grade movies, but this movie really didn't do it for me.  It was okay, I won't spend the money to own it.
B0001I561E|5.0|Aladdin takes the viewer on a delightful carpet ride; my granddaughters love seeing it repeatedly.  The cinematography is excellent.  Bravo!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|The movie was amazing.  When I initially saw the movie in the theaters, I did not like it that much.  After watching the movie on my HD television, I have to say I love it.  The movie has some great action scenes, and also is very funny as well.  My favorite part is when Black Widow fought the bad guys in the beginning after being tied up.

B003TJR2HS|2.0|I wasn't thrilled about the high price tag, but haven broken my iPod screen because it was out of the case in order to fit it in the speaker dock (it slipped out of fingers and fell to the ceramic tile floor), I needed a product that would remove the need to take my iPod out of its protective case, for virtually any reason. I was tempted by cheaper look-alikes and extender cords, but the reviews for most of those were mediocre at best. I spent the money and went for the dockStubz. I did not regret it. It fits as advertised, works as advertised, right out of the box. You can't go wrong.<br /><br />Well maybe. For a few months, it worked great. Then, the connection was anything but reliable. Moving the iPod around while mounted was the only hope of getting a good connection coming through both speakers. I wouldn't be so unsatisfied if it weren't for the high price tag. The company was quick to respond via Twitter regarding my dissatisfaction, but I did not follow up. I ordered a couple of significantly less expensive Patuoxun adapters, and so far, so good. I'd go with those.
B005FITIDC|5.0|This movie brings to light the story of young people in africa ,and the man who wanted to help them......Good story line....good action movie......My daughter recommended this one to me ,and I am recommending this one for you.....Gives you something to think about besides our own small problems :)

B009NPA3Q4|5.0|Rarely do you buy a CD and enjoy every single on it.  This is one of the best I have had in years
B002V5IH6Q|5.0|My Foo Fighters memory was hazy. I knew I loved 'All My Life,' but I didn't recall many of the other songs. Wow. I have listened to this album more than any other I've bought in the last year. Dave Grohl has a gift. If you're a fan of a song or two, buy the album, I'm sure you'll be happy you did.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|I hate it they say no at everything l got rid of it when it shut down my kindle it is stupid! !!!!!!!!!????$$$$$*&#9733;&#9733;*&#9733;
B00A0NOF7G|2.0|Cute story, but sooooooo many grammar mistakes! Plural vs possessive problems everywhere. PLEASE use grammar check on the computer or get a better editor. It was distracting enough that I couldn't finish reading, and it is a super short novel so that is definitely saying something!
0525953728|5.0|I could not put this book down. Chewed it up in one day. It is the most credible account of what actually happened. Read this book and don't take all the made for TV segments seriously. This book is the final word.
B007Q0OV6Q|5.0|Love the Lego advent calendars every year! Lego always puts out a quality product. My son gets so excited anticipating the next day's treat!
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|My entire life I've enjoyed the movie, but never watched it much & can not remember the last time that I was actually able to watch it without falling asleep.  Didn't have that problem with the book, but then again it is a children's story.  Nevertheless, it was very entertaining & is very different from the movie.  Makes one wish to create a cartoon that is true to the book.  Hopefully Disney's upcoming Oz movie sets the stage for a truer adaptation of this book in the future.  Heck, maybe in a decade or so we'll see Disney create Baum's dream of an Oz in one of their theme parks.  It's such a sweet story, filled with imaginative characters & locations, that most anyone should enjoy the experience.  It's got me so drawn in that I'm beginning the next book in the series.  I'm shocked by how much I enjoyed the book.  Why the heck did no one make me read this as a child?  I sure do love my Kindle.  Never would have read this without it.
B003DRWX9I|5.0|Even if you aren't a Slash aficionado, this album has so much great music from Slash himself and guest performers galore. Awesome album.
B004TN7QPG|4.0|I love the free version (obtained through Play Store, apparently not available from Amazon) but it doesn't support .pdf, so I upgraded to Pro for the .pdf feature.  It's great to have 1 reader for everything, but...<br /><br />Unfortunately the highlight feature in the pro version does not work as well as it does in the free version.  In the free version I can highlight a complete phrase, paragraph or line with a single stroke of my finger or stylus.  In the Pro version I can only highlight a single word then I have to grab the sliding arrows to expland the selection.  It works, but it's more fiddly.  IF I had never used the free version I'd probably be very happy with the Pro version; instead I'm disappointed because I do a LOT of highlighting and the free version is much more user-friendly.  I've tried every combination of setting, contacted the developer and tried his suggestions without success.<br /><br />The developer did respond promptly and professionally.  He gave me a couple of suggestions for settings changes, but neither fixed the problem.<br /><br />Bottom line, it's the best reader I've used so far, but I can't give it 5 stars because of this problem.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|Got this yesterday for free and just completed it. The game was not a bad times killer at all.I had read reviews before starting the game on my HTC evo 3d.<br />First thing you should do is turn off the timer. What everyone said about it is true, whenever you touch the screen to move around it registers the touch as a tap.<br />You can zoom in! I played on a phone and had no trouble zooming and rarely used a hint.<br />I thought that I would have trouble being that the list is stationary over a portion of the scene but it never required an item behind the list.<br />The story was good enough to hold your interest but I didn't even read all of it so I doubt skipping these would matter much. I would not pay more than a dollar for it though.<br />The pop up for trophy sharing was annoying.<br />I had to login to amazon to continue my game this morning! Never had that happen before but it started me back where I was o I was happy for that after reading some people say it would not save.<br />It was a good game. I would have given five stars but not being able to use the time feature and having to tap on an item just right hindered my enjoyment and the constant please review pop up annoyed me a bit. I did like the button at the end that takes you to the review page perhaps this should have been pointed out in the beginning for you to review at will instead of the pop ups throughout the game.<br />Mini games were not bad but they don't match the storyline that brings them up and they were a bit too simple for puzzle game lovers.
B00199B2Z8|5.0|I love Bryson's books because he manages to find the humor in everyday things. In this book he highlights some of our odd American quirks because he is an American who has spent twenty years living in England and things have changed a bit since he left. He moved back to a country that had changed quite a bit since he was a kid and he relates his experiences in a series of short essays.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I like to play games that easy to see and understand. It is nice to have while waiting for an appointment.a meeting to start or when there is nothing on TV and boredom seems to take over. This product is fun AND ENTERTAINING.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I would recommend this book series to anyone and everyone looking for a good book or book series! It is just wonderful! I miss reading them, hopefully there will be more!
B007FTZDN8|4.0|You just never know wht is going to be available.  Whatever you like, (especially &#34;green stuff&#34; ) it's been discussed on TED.  I learn new things every time I watch something.  A Valuable experience.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|The best book series I've EVER read! It was way more than I expected! I would recommend this to anyone and everyone!
B004SDEP38|3.0|It's OK for viewing, and moving around in Office files, but I am an Excel person,and that just plain needs a keyboard and Macros.  Not a fault of the app, it;s just the nature oif the beast.  Of course I have the full key unlocked version.  Love it for what it is, just a bit frustrating I can't input complex formulas and Visual Basic stuff.  Probably great if you are not a Power User.
B009AMALLM|5.0|i liked it can not wait until the next one come out. it was scary. i had no problems with the dvd
0425263916|5.0|I like any book where you can see and feel that the guy has feelings for the girl even though he may be a little rough around the edges.  Can't wait for the third book for the farytale ending.

B0059XTU1S|4.0|Peter Jackson's vision(and film crew)is amazing. A well paced even flow story doesn't seem to be nearly three hours long. The Hobbit fortunately doesn't suffer from 'Prequel misery' or loud unnecessary SFX sydrome. The only downer is waitng for the next two films to be released. I'm glad Mr. Jackson has the opportunity to create as a director instead of giving to'movie studio dictatorship'. It's time for a new AFI movie list and The Hobbit and the rest of The Lord of The Ring series has made it's mark.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|If you have any expectations for this CD it will surpass them. She sounds wonderful. The songs are classics and the duets show that her voice is as good as any established star's.
1401322786|5.0|I enjoyed the book tremendously.  A fast read, but very glad I found it.  I would recommend it to anyone.
B000NR8OXK|5.0|The quality of this used lp was very good. This is the first time I bought a used lp without seeing it before buying and I am quite satisfied.
B008QE9XD2|3.0|I like clean funny movies.  Call me old fashioned.  I don't even mind fast forwarding through a scene or two.  With this movie they were thrown in so awkwardly and overly bold it just trashed up a great film.
B000V1Y43W|5.0|Bough it for my nephew and he loves it cant get enough of it . He had previously owned it but played it till it broke this was a replacement.
0345802934|4.0|I found myself making time to read this book, even though in the end there was a lot to criticize.  It defies a genre--is it a love story,  science fiction, mystery?  Who knows.  The writing is meticulous and clean and is a joy to read, which helps get through some of the weaknesses in the story.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|This version of Emma ranks right up there with the BBC's version of Pride and Prejudice!  I love this movie!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I rated it a 5 because it's so much fun. If you love a challange you'll like this game. I like it because it's hard but really easy most of the time. I would recommend this to anybody who loves a challange.
B005OK725M|5.0|Awesome movie. I thought it was going to be a boring movie, but it actually has lots of action.! And specially good price (bought it for four bucks on cyber monday!)
B0086700CM|3.0|Well the game was fun but, the creators could've made the game more harder I found this game extremely easy.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I`m just a kid so the book was a bit confusing in some parts. But it's such an awesome book I don't care. Even better, I had a dictionary on my kindle so I can look up words which help me understand it. Great job Yann Martel!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|lots of fun little games to play. some of which are pretty difficult to complete! i absolutely love it. 4 stars
B004132HZS|5.0|This is one of the best series.  Absolutely  loved it.  I got one for my mother for Christmas.  I know she will love it.
B005HSL626|5.0|I chose this rating because it's so much fun the whole family plays it. I liked it because you can see how many fruit you can slice before the time is up. I would recommend this to anybody who loves to play fun and intersting games.
0393343405|4.0|In history class we learned that the Dark Ages were, well, dark, and the lights didn't come back on until the Greek and Roman humanist traditions were rediscovered in the Renaissance. Thus modern civilization officially began.<br /><br />What I never understood was how the lights came back on?  How does a culture that has been actively and accidently suppressed for over 1000 years reappear?<br /><br />Fragments of the physical monuments of the great civilizations remained even during the Dark Ages. In Rome, citizens were accustomed to the presence of ancient ruins and scavenged accordingly.  But the intellectual underpinnings of the architecture were long gone. Oral histories were forgotten, and manuscripts destroyed by book worms, fire, and mold.<br /><br />But not everyone ignored the traditions of the past. In the 14th C,  the scholar Petrarch discovered, studied, and distributed ancient masterpieces by Cicero and others. His work inspired other scholar sleuths. The hunt for lost manuscripts began in earnest.<br /><br />The main hunting ground for classic works was monasteries. Here monks mindlessly copied the great works and then shelved them for hundreds of years.<br />In one such remote monastery in 1417, a book hunter and sometime papal court employee Poggio Bracciolini uncovered a copy of Lucretius's influential poem On the Nature of Things.<br /><br />Its discovery was the equivalent of a replacing a 40 watt bulb with stadium lighting.<br /><br />Greenblatt explores how this surprisingly modern poem influenced thinkers from Shakespeare to Thomas Jefferson and took the world in an entirely new direction.<br /><br />I loved this book--- a mini refresher course in Western Civ without the boring lectures and the final exam!
B0084BMUFA|4.0|Always one of my favorites.  A Christmas story that never grows old. Definitely something to share with your children and childrens children. A yearly tradition!
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|This is a great book to read , I found myself not wanting to put this book down  not for one minute,  I strongly recommend this book
B004Q7IAQE|5.0|For my daughter this was perfect in size and in cuteness. It was larger than i expected. About 12 inches tall.  Very cute plush.  As pictured and described by seller. Got this for my ten year old. We received this product before delivery date, which is awesome!.  Got it through Amazon.
076780421X|5.0|This is a fascinating tale about two people meeting and their efforts to merge their very different lives together. But love draws them constantly together.
B009NPM5Y2|2.0|Horrible movie, although Tommy boy did sound pretty good on the mic. Not to mention, the service cut of 3/4 of the way though the movie! $ better spent watching something else.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Loved it!! Very weird and surreal. Reminded me of some of Ray Bradburys work. Will recommend it to my friends.
B000ZNRBK4|5.0|yep this is great for shooting with natural lights outdoor. just make sure you take it off when you are using the built in flash.
B009A9BEHU|2.0|I went to their concert(indoor) and it was mind blowing!!!! I think they missed the mark because the music cd is mostly from outdoor concerts so the quality sucks. I expected long live tracks that one only gets to experence in concert. This review is only for the music cd. I wish I could get a recording of the St. Paul Mn. concert that I went too!!!! I also saw them 2 years ago and that concert was mindblowing also. I just want to say preview before buying.
0525952926|5.0|Mr. Follett does such an incredible job of mixing fact with fiction...just an awesome book! I can't wait to read the 3rd book in this trilogy!  Ken Follett is the master storyteller!
0525953728|4.0|I thought it was important to obtain a copy of this book before someone decides to ban it. I am a little amazed that it has been published.
B00498TQV8|4.0|Winter's Bone took me back, in more than a few parts, to childhood. Like the Ozarks, I grew up in coal mine country of West Virginia. My family didn't do drugs but the poverty was rampant.<br /><br />I identified with the young girl Ree Dolly, played by Jennifer Lawrence, in the sense of family first and responsibility. It's not something that's told to you nor that you're trained in. They just seem like the 'right thing to do' and 'don't get in my way'.<br /><br />The 'positional roles' also seem to just be they way it is, in the country. It works for us.<br /><br />I love the mountain music. It stirs something down deep in my soul whenever I hear it. I've been told the blues do the same thing to black folk. It's better than any drug. It tells the story in ballads about the way things have always been with mountain folks.<br /><br />I didn't give it a 5 because I found some of the dialog to be difficult to understand sometimes. Not the accent, mind you, but understanding the \\"low speaking dialog\\".<br /><br />All in all, my wife and I love it and critiqued it throughout.
B004BLJQOK|4.0|Having caught glimpses of the original Let the Right One In (LTROI) on Showtime Beyond a month or so ago I was truly intrigued and finally was able to watch it in its' entirety about a week ago. As someone who enjoys foreign films and is not intimidated by sub-titles, I actually prefer foreign language versions to any dubbed effort. Well I was treated to one of the most enjoyable films I've ever seen. Beautiful, sad, horrific and  yes, erotic, I also saw one the of the best vampire films ...EVER! There was a gorgeous subtlety and visceral impact to the effects in LTROI. Let Me In (LMI), which I had to and did watch ASAP, took most of its cues from the original, but was still a thoroughly enjoyable film in its own right... And it brought out two very important aspects that I missed (?) in the original LTROI.... Firstly when Abby/Eli tells Owen/Oskar, \\"I'm not a girl\\" I simply thought she/he was referring to the fact that she/he is not human, i.e. \\"I'm not a girl, I'm a vampire...\\" (Also in LTROI intially I thought the actress Lina Liandersson was a boy!) But a scene in LTROI where we see a quick shot of a scar on Eli's lower abdomen combined with Matt Reeves commentary on the deleted scenes for LMI was that Abby/Eli was in fact a castrated young boy... I have not as yet read the original novel, which I assume will give more details as to Abby/Eli's origin... It's next on my reading list... Secondly I almost gasped while watching LMI that a key item I missed while watching LTROI was when I realized that Abby was not just befriending Owen as a kindred soul but in fact was recruiting him as her next \\"Caretaker\\"... Abby/Eli has lived for hundreds of years and has had probably a dozen caretakers, humans who protect them during their vulnerable times like Straker in Salem's Lot, and who eventually grow old and die (or burn themselves into unrecognizable states with acid). In LTROI we see the caretaker simply grow old and careless and completely incapable of completing his duties while in LMI we see the caretaker become bitter and angry at his incompetence and yet both endlessly love their charges to the point of offering themselves for feeding before dying. Owen/Oskar has now become Abby/Eli's new \\"love\\" and will transport her/him and enable her/him to survive... Absolutely brilliant...<br /><br />PS When Eli/Abby's caretaker asks her/him not to see that boy again, is it concern or jealousy? Hmmm...duties while in LMI we see the caretaker become bitter and angry at his incompetence and yet both endlessly love their charges to the point of offering themselves for feeding before dying.

B00A3ATW4M|3.0|With most of the cast of Glee 'graduating' at the end of last season, it's up to a batch of newcomers to pick up the slack and help out old favorites. The new members seem to be cloning the old (Mallory is Rachel, Kitty is the new Quinn, etc), so it's a bit tough to make distincions in the musical presentation. It helps that old hands Blaine, Artie, and yes, Rachel and Kurt are still here to add support. It's just not enough, though.<br /><br />There are highlights, like the groups sung version of Coldplay's \\"The Scientist,\\" and Marley and Rachel's duet on \\"New York State of Mind.\\" Talking David Bowie's was an adventurous choice (even more so was Sam and Britney doing \\"Celebrity Skin,\\" which is not included here). Kitty and Marley do a nice job resurrecting Bonnie Tyler's \\"Holding Out For a Hero\\" (from \\"Footloose\\"). Minus points are given for \\"Gangnam Style,\\" this years most annoying one hit wonder.<br /><br />Missing are the songs from outside the pop spectrum. I'd have much rather had \\"Let's have a Kiki/Turkey Lurkey\\" here than a few of these songs, along with Kurt's version of \\"Being Alive\\" from the musical \\"Company.\\" I miss the variety; I guess the \\"Glease\\" CD was supposed to satisfy that segment of the musical audience. Overall, \\"Glee: Season 4 Vol 1\\" is not a total dud, but the series seems close to jumping the shark.
B003O86FMW|4.0|this book honestly has two tones. the beginning, which is more of an emotional journey and the second, which is more action packed. but they both fit very well together.
B000J5XS3C|5.0|the Beringer 802 mixer is by far the lowest costing and best performing mixer for the price on the market..  Works fantastic and I am very happy with it..
B00A1XOPE8|4.0|Very engaging and well written. The ending was great but the boom could've gone on just a little longer. All in all an amazing read
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|For me, &#34;Standing Ovation&#34; is Susan Boyle's best album yet.  I love her rendition of &#34;Over the Rainbow&#34; and enjoy her duets with Donnie Osmond as well. Also, included on this album is a song called &#34;The Winner Takes It All&#34; which is a very emotional song but one I have never heard before even though the Album states that the songs are &#34;the Greatest Songs From The Stage&#34;.<br />Anyway, this is my kind of music and I look forward to her next album.
1451695195|5.0|Excellent, well written with scientific explanations as to why the experience had to be real, and not a dream type function.  I wish anyone with any doubts concerning near death experiences would read the book.
B008TRUDAS|4.0|This was a great book! I loved the characters and the story lines behind each of them! Definitely cried a couple  of times but every tear was worth it!
B009JBZH54|5.0|The discs have perfect resolution and the story line over all is a very good one. Very happy to have this set in my collection.
B0000DJZA5|4.0|Definitely the highlights are Don't Let Me Down and The Long and Winding Road.<br />The original Let It Be album is also good, but Phil Spector killed The Long and Winding Road, and he should have included Don't Let Me Down from the rooftop concert, as he included other songs from the concert.<br />Overall this album is good.
B004U8VQOW|5.0|I saw this Movie on the big 3D Imax theater in McMinnville Oregon after checking out the &#34;Spruce Goose&#34; flying boat. This DVD just can't compare with that, however at least it has the basic pictures of what I saw there and I can watch it over and over. God's creation is truly amazing.
B000JO9JHW|5.0|Dexter is a real on the edge of your seat show!!! I am completely hooked. Will definitely be purchasing season 2
B0059XTU22|5.0|I have a feeling the next two films in The Hobbit trilogy will be even better, but An Unexpected Journey is still a beautiful and engaging piece of movie magic. The acting by Martin Freeman as Bilbo Baggins, Ian McKellan as Gandalf and all the dwarves were great. The man and voice behind Gollum also has a memorable 10 minutes of screen time. The CGI is of the highest calibur, but I did miss the real make-up effects used for the Orcs in LOTR (almost all the faces and bodies of the Orcs are pure CGI here). I think many critics are being far to harsh, though the majority still liked it. This is much smaller in scale than the LOTR, but its is still filled with wonderful characters, action, music and another amazing quest we will have to wait another two years to complete.<br /><br />IMAX 3-D is the way to go if possible, which includes a 9 minute scene from the new Star Trek: Into Darkness film.
