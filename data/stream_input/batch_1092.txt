030746363X|5.0|Very good book , gives you a good insight on techniques that seem in fact so logical. There are a few references that allows you to search for the actual scientific articles if you're sceptical. It seems to work for most people though Tim Ferriss experienced it all on himself mainly. Very handy , cheap and enjoying.  Strongly recommend it wether you want to increase your fitness and health level or just are curious.
1843793792|5.0|I haven't read this particular novel by Heyer so I do not know how good it is as an abridged adaptation, but the audiobook on its own, is very enjoyable.  The story moves at a good pace and the characters are all very engaging.  Richard Armitage's performances as the various characters were brilliant and appropriate to the character, especially Damerel.

Since they made it look exactly like the others if you don't carefully read it could end up buying it for the extended version just to learn there not there not wanting any more of these for the future! at the very l;east they should have lowered the price since it contained less then the first two.

B0002KVUKM|5.0|Another Stephen Sommers masterwork, and a movie that may prove ultimately more rewarding even than \\"The Mummy\\".  I am not surprised by the great spread of reviews here.  When watching this, one must be attentive to all the dialogue, noting nuances and background settings, etc., so as to understand the progression of the plot, which is grandly that of the struggle between good and evil.  Yet there is more.  Dense and complex, Van Helsing becomes better with repeated viewings, and dealing with such issues as love and commitment, honor, evil and curses, and eternal salvation, it certainly does have its fascinations!  Not a movie for the young though, and certainly not for all tastes; an adult fantasy mixing a number of themes with even humor and modern cinematography.  However, if one is interested in the supernatural, the unknown, the quest for triumph, possibly even the sublime, give this a try!<br /><br />  Recently I have seen \\"Van Helsing\\" again, being broadcast on cable, and I picked up some ideas and concepts not appreciated the first time or two around.  But this is not at all to be unexpected, as upon the first viewing one may anticipate being thrown into some confusion.  I have also not mentioned there is excellent acting all throughout, led by Hugh Jackman as Van Helsing himself.  Time will, I believe, uphold this as one of the very finest adult fantasy movie experiences.
B00007KWHG|3.0|The first few songs made for Veejay, Walk Like A Man, Candy Girl, Sherry, Big Girls Don't Cry are very good.  But the Phillips stuff is a mess.  Rag Doll, Dawn, Save it For Me & Lets Hang On are mono & good stereo versions exist.  Big Man In Town, Tell It To The Rain & Don't Think Twice - 3 great songs were omitted!  Rhino sucks in my opinion.  This is for the beginner fans only.
1569757275|5.0|The authors provide exactly what the title promises-- a compendium of current Chinese slang.  I'm a native English speaker learning Chinese, and the explanations of current conversational slang are a useful supplement to formal dictionaries.  (I have also asked several native Chinese speakers their opinions, and they say that the book is on target.)    Some of the other reviewers who gave the book low marks appear to have judged it based on its \\"dirty\\" or offensive language.  Well, that's exactly what the book says it delivers!  And, it gives guidance on which phrases are friendly and which are insulting.     The overall tone of the book resembles what a youthful (say, college age) friend might use in coaching a newbie to China. For this book that seems appropriate.
030745455X|3.0|724 pages of \\"Fire\\" with over 200 pages of smoke. I enjoyed the main characters, Mikael Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander and the main story line. There is plenty of suspense and who done it, with some action, however when the murder investigation is done by the police, private investigators, and journalists the progress or lack of is described three times over and over and over again. Some call it filler, but in this one I call it smoke.<br /><br />The author makes amends with a very exciting finish which leads excellently into \\"The Hornet's Nest.\\" I will read that in paperback.
6304696566|5.0|First, the film:<br /><br />This is my personal favorite Western of them all... period. (Followed closely by Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven.)<br /><br />Ford shot in Monument Valley, one of his favorite locations, and -- wow -- do he know how to shoot. This film also displays some of his favorite visual touches -- keep an eye on the very opening moment and the closing moment. (Won't tell you more than that.) Once you've seen the film, consider David Lynch, Martin Scorsese, and a slew of other directors who pick up on Ford film styles in their own work.<br /><br />This may also be John Wayne's darkest role, certainly one of them. Wayne plays a real anti-hero here. Ford deliberately gives him a racist side, and that is only part of the darkness. Wayne's character of Ethan Edwards is vastly deeper and more complex than the huge majority of comparable characters in any film genre, and Wayne carries it off.<br /><br />The story touches on an issue that recurs through the first 200 years of American history (say 1650 to 1850, very roughly) -- the captured white person. Check out \\"The Redeemed Captive\\" by John Williams (written 300 years ago) and \\"The Unredeemed Captive\\" written by John Demos in the 1990s.<br /><br />Now, the Blu Ray disc:<br /><br />Several people have commented on the Warner Brothers presentation of the film in two aspect ratios, that commonly seen on standard definition television and a widescreen version that has the top and bottom cropped. There are some very helpful comments on this. I do not know the intentions of Warner Brothers or John Ford on presentation.<br /><br />The one thing I do know is that Warner Brothers has a well-established history of really mangling their films to squeeze as much money as possible out of them. They viciously overcompress signals so that compression artifacts are glaring. The have cropped films and called them \\"restored versions\\". Their marketers, producers and executives are among the most craven money-grubbers to be found in the entertainment industry... and that's saying something. Take the critical comments of others in consideration.g something. Take the critical comments of others in consideration.

B004856SQ8|5.0|[[ASIN:B002ZG994U The A-Team]] takes the genre of action-comedy movies to a new level. The A-Team is a hit Army Ranger squad that specializes in convoluted plans to get the mission done. After a mission in Baghdad goes wrong, the team is arrested on false pretenses and then goes about proving its innocence. The intricacies of the A-Team's plans surpass anything found in [[ASIN:B000P0J0BK Ocean's Eleven]]. Yet, unlike that movie, where the plan just seemed unrealistic, the A-Team's plans are at the same time brilliant and great to watch. The only thing that seems off is the villain Pike, who alone among the bad guys seems to know how to fight and has an attitude. Otherwise, a fun movie.

B00007LTIA|2.0|It's obvious that the only objective for this Yes album was to fulfill the conceit of making four album-side length songs. How those songs are composed, and whether they made cohesive pieces of music was secondary at best. I don't understand other reviewers take on this album as great progressive rock. It's NOTHING like Close to the Edge or Fragile in the way those albums could draw the listener in and involve him with great grooves and great musical pieces that gel together. The album cover is the best part.
B0034G4P7G|2.0|This film is simply difficult to watch. MZ is portrayed as so ridiculously arrogant and narcissistic that you don't want to listen to much of anything he says, which turns out be just fine, since the background noise overshadows dialog though most of the movie. The story moves incredibly slowly, despite the incredibly fast rate at which the characters speak.     You're presented with the idea of a story about the work, emotion, and people behind Facebook. What you're actually given is highly disappointing. The story is told almost completely in the third person by those involved in the two most prominent lawsuits. MZ's character contributes little more than the occasional smartass remark from across the table as someone makes testimony, and you're left to draw your own conclusions as to the accuracy of the bits of story you've just watched.     The film wasn't exactly badly written, as at least the characters sound like they could possibly be intelligent enough to pull off such a thing, but arrogance reigns supreme, making it difficult to root for anyone, and you're never given a real glimpse of any morality to make you believe in MZ. The film wasn't horrible, but it's nowhere near as good as it's been made out to be. Don't go into it expecting to be blown.
1439133948|3.0|It's been a long time since Lois McMaster Bujold gave us a Miles Vorkosigan novel - eight years, to be precise, since Diplomatic Immunity. I've missed Miles; his adventures have always been the science fictional equivalent of popcorn, fun to read, not too taxing, written breezily and well. Cryoburn takes a leap in time to show us a Miles who is now 39 years old, married with four children, and working as an Imperial Auditor - with his own peculiar, almost childlike, disregard for rules and complete creativity and curiosity. It's good to read about him again.    This adventure finds Miles on the planet Kibou-daini, which is built around the industry of cryonics, that is, freezing those who are fatally ill, injured, or just too old to live any longer. The idea is supposed to be that these individuals will be thawed and cured of their afflictions as cures are discovered by medical science, but oddly, few revivals ever take place. The reason for this seems to be not that medical science is making no advances, but because the cryocorps that run the cryonics businesses accumulate the votes of those who are frozen, and are allowed to exercise them. Who wants to give up even a single vote - a single bit of power - by reviving someone?    Miles goes to Kibou-daini under the pretense of attending a conference on cryonics, but when we first come across him on this planet, he is wandering about the deep, dark halls of a typical cryocorps installation, with rows upon rows of frozen corpsicals around him, hallucinating. Someone attempted to kidnap him and probably shot him with a sedative to keep him quiet. Unfortunately, because of Miles's strange body chemistry, most sedatives have precisely the opposite effect on him. The hyperactivity which resulted was probably what allowed him to escape his captors, but now he's lost and not exactly in his right mind.    Fortunately, Miles is rescued by a young boy, Jin, who takes him back to his homeless shelter and cares for Miles until Miles recovers from the drug. This particular homeless shelter, though, turns out to be quite fascinating to Miles. It is an illegal, underground cryocorps, freezing people who can't afford the procedure otherwise. This business and its owner show a whole new aspect to the cryonics business to Miles, and reveals a fissure in Kibou-daini's society between the wealthy and the poor - one that is even more a matter of life and death than is the same fissure in our own society. Miles becomes very interested in and involved with Jin, who turns out to have a mother who is a political activist working for justice in cryonics, a mother who was illegally frozen to shut her up when her protests started to catch fire.    Miles accomplishes his first mission - to prevent a Kibou-daini takeover of Barrayar - quickly and with finesse, but by then he is more interested in Kibou-daini's problems, and more specifically, with Jin's. His schemes to solve those problems consumes the bulk of the book in trademark Vorkosigan style, complete with conning the conmen, deceiving the liars, politicians and corporate bigwigs, and working some real justice for those for whom the word \\"justice\\" has been only a theory that never worked in their favor.     In other words, this is a typical Miles Vorkosigan story. It's fun. This is by no means the equal of Bujold's more challenging Vorkosigan novels like Mirror Dance; I'd be very surprised indeed if this book were nominated for any awards, no matter how often Bujold has been on the Hugo and Nebula shortlists. But that's not to say that it's not worth reading, because it is. I'd enjoy ten more like it. But the end of the book indicates that Miles is moving into a new phase of his life, and I suspect that the next Vorkosigan novel is going to be quite different from this one. I look forward to it.

She, by the way, is not a A, B or even a C actress.  Her best stuff was in the Transformer movies where action was better than dialog.  I was disappointed in my purchase but there was some enterntaining qualities I think John Malkovich is an underappreciated actor.  Josh Brolin is an ok actor but the action sequences lack realism.

Then I basically stole my brother's Exit Stage Left cassette. Then I kind of forgot about Rush for a while. That is until I picked up the Live in Rio DVD. Amazing concert!  After that I went back to buy a good portion of their albums. After watching Beyond the Lighted Stage I am officially a huge fan, and now I own all their albums. It's refreshing to see a group of guys that are so down to earth and classy despite all the success. They are so deserving and work so hard on their craft. Never losing focus. It makes me like them more!  Aside from all that this DVD is well produced and their story must be told. They are one of the greatest rock bands of all time up there with Led Zepplin and Pink Floyd!

B000Q6GUW0|5.0|In principal I'd have to say that gluing myself to a tv set to watch a cable series about a sociopath is probably not a good thing to do. Analyze this further and admittedly there is something more than a little perverse when I realize that I sort of like Dexter Morgan and don't find myself really being repelled by the antics of this serial killer. Regardless of all the logical reasons why I shouldn't find this so darn appealing, I am becoming adicted to Dexter and it has a lot to do with the writing, acting, and production values that make this one compelling series in the vein of dark comedy with a lot of drama thrown in.<br />I got into the Dexter phenomena relatively late during the fourth season and I purchased this box set purely out of curiosity. I have yet to watch any of the optional features. Trying to compare one season against another season of Dexter seems a little futile since I am enjoying my entire catch-up experience which is now into the third season. However, the reason I am reviewing Season I is because it is an essential component of the series and provides the foundation for the series and Dexter's oddball code of wiping out the truly evil as defined by his foster father Harry Morgan.<br />Season One is a mix of the progressive antics of the Ice Truck Killer and his game playing with Dexter who has apparently had an active career as a serial killer while his day job is as a blood splatter expert for the Metro Miami Police. Through 12 episodes, the author is introduced to Dexter via wry introspective monologues and continued flashbacks between Dexter and the now-deceased Harry. The viewer learns that sociopath Dexter observes a code to kill only the truly evil bad guys as a way to channel his homicidal tendencies. Harry, a seasoned cop, instructs the young Dexter in the ways of commiting the perfect murder without detection while ridding the world of the bad guys. This evolves into projecting Dexter as a modern day perverse Robin Hood who manages to function fairly well within a social framework despite not having much connection with real human emotion or conscience. As the first season progresses, slight changes in Dexter's personality are detected as the Ice Truck Killer continues with his murderous rampage.<br />With each episode, this season continues to build suspensefully until the taut conclusion. It introduces the viewer to the quirky and interesting supporting characters that make this series so rich in characterizations and provides Dexter with a protagonist in Detective Doakes. While all the seasons of Dexter are excellent, this one really defines the character and provides a basic foundation for the subsequent seasons.s to function fairly well within a social framework despite not having much connection with real human emotion or conscience.

B001KVAMM4|5.0|I really like the package of a Cd and DVD for the purchaser. I know most of us are primarily interested in \\"the music\\". The inclusion of the DVD has a \\"cool\\" factor that simply cannot be ignored. Watching Ms. Mutter play the music gave me a sense of the entire project (a depth) that I think I would have missed if I'd only heard the cd.    Ok - She is very easy on the eyes. Still, watching her in concert gave me an insight into the music that the cd simply could not...her intensity and concentration while playing is absolutely clear! I totally disagree with some reviewers that she looks \\"wooden\\". Personally, when I attend a concert, I want the performer to give me his/her all. I think that is what is at work in the video. She is playing with her audience in mind...giving the music her entire being. Seriously, this is what I am seeing here...and I am captivated.    Finally, I can find no flaw in the sound quality. Some of the reviewers have claimed that the sound quality is low??? I own a serious home entertainment system in my living room and a \\"good\\" system for listening in my office. I have played both the CD and DVD on both and the sound is excellent.     If you're wondering whether this CD/DVD is worth your entertainment dollar, I believe it most certainly is...the documentary is fantastic. This is worthy of a 5 star rating.

1594202842|4.0|While it is easy to become indignant and shocked at some of the extreme behavior the author describes in the book, it must be remembered that this is more of a mother's memoir, not a how-to book. And beyond that, it is an entertaining and engaging book to read.  I almost didn't buy this book because it seemed rated so low, but I now see that some people are giving it low ratings because they disapprove of Chua.  I think Chua shows great courage in exposing herself (with her flaws, doubts, regrets and mistakes), and demonizing her only serves to miss the entire point of the book.  This book really follows the journey Chua went through, reconciling her own upbringing, changing course with her parenting, disagreeing with her husband about how the children should be raised, and grappling with the doubts she had about whether or not she was doing the right thing.  What mother can't relate to that?    Growing up, I played the cello and piano, and I saw tremendous pressure put on young musicians by their parents. The demands Chua puts on her children go on in many families, though most like to give the appearance that their children are just naturally talented and gifted, without admitting the incredible amount of work, sacrifice and practice that they are subjected to.  I personally would never raise my child the way Chua raised her daughters, but I must admit this book did give me pause about whether or not I allow my daughter to quit things she doesn't like too early, and whether I worry too much about her self-esteem.  I know how mind-numbingly boring it often is to attend music lessons and sports practices with my child, and find myself admiring Chua's ability to put her children before her own needs. I found the concept of how Chinese parents(according to Chua) \\"assume strength, not fragility\\" in their children to be very thought-provoking.  I know I will be thinking about this book for a while, and to me, that makes it a book worth reading.

This depraved, pathetic woman tries to sell emotional abuse as a stepping stone for her children to achieve some distorted, dysfunctional  definition of \\"success\\". So-called \\"Tiger Mothers\\" are, in fact, inferior to the nurturing mothers of the world, but this book is designed  to have you believe the opposite.

This book belongs in the ash heap of history from where its neolithic ideas came.
B0042EJD8A|5.0|This is a great film, which aims to not destroy an industry, but expose the secrecy and flawed policies which have been pushed through by industry.  Yes millions of people are employed by industry related to fossil fuels, and our entire society is dependant on the process, but that doesnt make it exempt from proper regulation....and I am able to think far enough ahead in my future to realize money won't help me if I'm dying from chemical contamination.

0316098337|4.0|\\"Room\\" is a literary achievement, although I, for one, would not have placed it on the New York Times' list of the 10 best books of 2010.  I admired the author for so cannily taking on the voice of a 5-year old for her protagonist.  I doubt many could have pulled this off so successfully.  The plot was exciting and suspenseful, but not quite a page-turner.  But, at the end, I felt curiously unsatisfied, and I failed to find the meaning in the book that so many others have found.  I was left with a good, if not compelling, book, an admirable exercise in creative writing, but one that had little meaning for me that transcended the obvious elements of the plot.
B0019T9FL6|4.0|January, 15th, 2011<br /><br />I didn't watch much of American Idol season 3 but if Fantasia didn't win it, Jennifer should have been next in line. She's got an even bigger voice and a nice personality. She's not obnoxious or always in the tabloids for doing the wrong things and that is something to be proud of (by the way, I wasn't speaking negatively about 'Tasia, just the tabloid queens in general).<br /><br />This CD has a good mix of things going on in it genre-wise. Here are some highlights:<br /><br />1. SPOTLIGHT: The 1st single and a decent choice at that. Nice vocal work and a good bridge.<br /><br />3. POCKETBOOK (Feat. Ludacris): Originally set to be the 3rd single but denied, this is the best original track on the disc. Very upbeat and has an undeniable beat. Underrated.<br /><br />4. GIVING MYSELF: Written by the wondrous Robin Thicke, this emotional ballad lets you in. Shows off Jennifer's range towards the end.<br /><br />8. I'M HIS ONLY WOMAN (Feat. Fantasia): A great duet with two powerhouse vocalists.<br /><br />9. CAN'T STOP THE RAIN: An R&B ballad with a good story. One of the highlights here.<br /><br />12. AND I AM TELLING YOU I'M NOT GOING: The most powerful vocals on the album and the definite show-stealer. Can also be found on the album [[ASIN:B000J103YI Dreamgirls]].<br /><br />So all in all, the rating here is about right. As of 1/15/2011, [[ASIN:B0019T9FL6 Jennifer Hudson]]'s score is at a 3.9 and I can't argue with that. It has its flaws, but mostly stays consistent. A few weak tracks are here but the strong tracks are pretty strong.<br /><br />\\"C+\\" 3.8 stars (or a 7.8/10)<br /><br />DOWNLOAD:<br />\\"And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going\\"<br />\\"Pocketbook\\" &<br />\\"Giving Myself\\"
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I bought this book (kindle edition) because of the high ratings it received. What I wasn't prepared for is the utterly dark, dreary, and shocking premise of this story. It was a page turner, but I felt as if I was a rubber-necker - a person passing the scene of an accident that couldn't help straining to watch the carnage unfold. Yes, there are moments of tenderness, but they are so fleeting and surrounded by such desolation and destruction, that I found myself praying for one extended moment of joy to give me, the reader, a breather. I wished Peeta and Katniss could hold onto their fleeting interludes. I wished Gale and Katniss remained wrapped in their hunting world. I wished for an end to the desolation. Unfortunately, nothing Gold can Stay in this book and everything always went dark again. The thin veneer of hope always gave way to darker motives of the Capital, dark motives of Katniss, dark motives of humans in general.<br /><br />Can I say it's not worth reading - no. Did I enjoy it? I'm honestly not sure. I keep likening it to the scene of an accident, where the victims might survive, but they have lost all that is dear to them, including body parts, and bits of their humanity. So, I can't reccommend or discourage one from reading this book. It's well written, as Ms. Collins is a great story teller. I think it comes down to why you read books. For me, I find enough despair and dreariness in the real world that I prefer my books to be an escape from reality, not a magnification of it. I did read the entire trilogy- especially when I found out my 12-year-old's classmates were reading this. I honestly don't know what to make of it. Great writing - gut wrenching - dreary - apocolyptic story that made me just want it to end, but at the same time, needing to reach the end because I hoped it had a brighter ending than it did a beginning and middle.

0792101448|5.0|Very nice movie for the year it was made. The only thing I don't like to see in that movie are those \\"Chemtrails\\" in the section where the whole family gets wiped out which is disturbing by its self. Freshly sprayed line in a clip where the teenage girl is looking at birds which are flying away from gunshots. It's the clip where you see a shotgun standing against something and her looking up. In the same chapter you can see the whole sky covered by chemclouds in moment where the father is looking around where the shots are coming from. Someone is spraying us for long time and this movie is evidence of that and it's getting worse and worse by day even many people and politicians are awaken to this fact. No one is able to stop this insanity.
0385523386|5.0|I've been curious about what it's like for women in prison.  This memoir is a well-written, candid view of what it is like inside a minimum security women's prison and later, inside the horrid Chicago prison.<br /><br />Piper Kerman is sentenced to 15 months for delivering a suitcase full of drug money. While in prison, she comes to full terms with her crime. She realizes that it was a crime against other women who are trapped in drug addiction because of her part in the trafficking scheme.  She is deeply sorry.<br /><br />The tone of the book is one of courage, sorrow, shame, regret, and strength.<br /><br />I found it horrifying to learn how incarcerated women are treated with total disrespect as human beings made by God, and how they are abused both verbally and physically by the very people that are hired to work there. As a tax-payer, it infuriates me that men inappropriately grope the attractive women after they return from family visits, for just one example.<br /><br />I also found it horrifying that there is not an adequate program in place to prepare the women for re-entry into the outside world.  Without that, they are vulnerable to repeat offenses.  If there is no direction, no help, no way for them to make an honest living, they are vulnerable to being mules for drug kings, etc.  For example, in the so-called class for women about to leave the prison, one woman raised her hand and asked, \\"How can we find a job where they will hire someone with a record?\\"<br /><br />The presenter fumbled around and said, \\"Maybe look in the newspaper or on the Internet.\\"<br /><br />\\"How do we look on the Internet?\\"<br /><br />\\"Don't you have computers here?\\"<br /><br />\\"No, no computers. And, I've been here since before people had computers.\\"<br /><br />\\"Oh, well, I'll have to look into that.\\"  Right, that never happened.  So there was no answer, no helpful hints, nothing taught about how to actually locate honest employment.<br /><br />There are so many insights into the system and into the prison society itself in this book. There are also moments of triumph and humor.  I was not disappointed!<br /><br />I found it fascinating, and I think Piper was courageous to write such a candid, truthful look at what REALLY goes on, both in Danbury and in the horrid Chicago prison where she got transferred near the end.  It was there that she had to wear the orange, by the way.s of triumph and humor.  I was not disappointed!    I found it fascinating, and I think Piper was courageous to write such a candid, truthful look at what REALLY goes on, both in Danbury and in the horrid Chicago prison where she got transferred near the end.

B003U9V6A6|5.0|This was an amazing CD!! I actually got it for my friend for Christmas. She loves it so much!! It was also at a great price. I would suggest this to anyone who love The Script. Great CD, they never have let me down.
6305781427|5.0|Great, inspiring music.
6305428352|5.0|Richard Dreyfuss performance in this movie is fantastic. The movie pictures how life ordeals can shape one's future in a more positive way than it can initially be perceive. Glenn Holland (Dreyfuss) is a passionate musician who dreams of composing one truly memorable piece of music. However in order to support his wife and a newborn son he reluctantly accepts a job as high school music teacher on temporary basis. This temporary job turned out to become his successful career.  To paraphrase The Rolling Stones - \\"You can't always get what you want -  But if you try sometimes you might find - You get what you need\\".
B003XQRZ7E|5.0|I love this cd, it is so great to hear something new that is as it should be.  I really miss the days when we knew more about a \\"BAND\\" than who is the star.  Everything about this cd is done very well writing, playing, sound, etc.  This is the first cd, done by a new group, that I have listened to in a long time that I really enjoy.  I hope they continue to put out cds.
B002JH3TW8|4.0|I needed an adapter to connect my firewire 800 external drive to my new Macintosh computer.  This short, sweet connector didn't add much cord and did what I needed.
0439882826|5.0|This pop-up book has ruined all other pop-up books for me.  This book is THE BEST pop-up book I have EVER seen in my life (and I own a lot of books).  The detail and complexity of the pop-ups is absolutely amazing!  My husband and daughters spend hours looking at all of the intricate details.  The price is fantastic- especially for the amount of time it will take you to look through this fabulous book!  I would whole-heartedly recommend this book to Star Wars fans of any age.
B004BLJQOK|5.0|I'm not a big fan of horror movies, but this one really had me.  It's the most engrossing horror film I've seen in years.<br /><br /> Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee) is a lonely kid, mercilessly bullied at school, whose parents are divorcing.  One winter night, he meets Abby (Chloe Grace Moretz), a girl who has just moved into the apartment complex and never wears shoes.<br /><br /> Abby is a vampire, trapped in a child's body, and her \\"father\\" (Richard Jenkins) is actually her protector.  Not only does he go out and kill people so that Abby can have blood, but when she does the dastardly deed herself, he disposes of the body.<br /><br /> Both friendless, Owen and Abby bond and it is a relationship that endures even after the young man learns the truth about the strange girl.<br /><br /> Adapted by director Matt Reeves (CLOVERFIELD) from a Swedish novel by John Ajvide Lindqvist, LET ME IN is both a horror film and a heart-wrenching tale about the pain of adolescence.  Abby may kill people in order to survive, but she is also a victim.  She didn't ask to become a vampire.<br /><br /> The picture is dark and violent, though much of the blood-letting (wisely) happens off-screen.  It is also a love story that will haunt you long after the movie ends.<br /><br />© Michael B. Druxman
B0044XV3QY|5.0|For anyone who loved the movie Avatar(the orignal release),the Extened Collector's Edition is a must have. The extra footage, I think fills in some gaps in the story also I found the colors deeper/sharper than the orignal release and both are Blu-ray which I watched on my big screen HDTV. I'm impressed,a solid 5 star in my book.....
B003PIUBZS|4.0|Spartacus is perhaps the most famous unknown man in history.  We don't know his real name or what he looked like,much less his true background.  He led the greatest slave revolt in history against history's greatest Empire.  So we fill in the blanks before he meets his historic demise.  And no,alas,there was no moment when the survivors all claimed to be Spartacus just as Kirk Douglas was about to stand up.  This series is enjoyable in laying out life in ancient Rome.  The characters are interesting & the battles in the arena fun.  Indeed, one can certainly see why the Romans enjoyed this blood sport where sudden death overtime had real meaning.    Spartacus was a man who refused to be a slave for the entertainment of others.  Thus he stands as a warning to those who would enslave others.  This series is excellent in that.  So enjoy the lesson.
0716703343|5.0|Pretty sure I've already reviewed this, but oh well. I got this for my boyfriend for Christmas, and I ordered it kind of late. Emailed the seller, and he was able to get it to me in advance! The book was in perfect quality, no nicks or scratches, etc. Great product, and I'd consider ordering from this seller again!
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|My grandson is obsessed with trains, so when I saw this movie advertised, I thought it would be a good one to watch with the entire family.  It made a perfect Christmas Eve, enjoying the story with the whole family.  Truly a must movie to watch with little ones (my grandchildren are 4 and 5).
B001P06GX4|5.0|I bought this game as a gift for a grown son. Our family of four, all adults, enjoyed playing this game so much that I bought one for ourselves since my son took his when he returned to his home. We regularly play dominoes with friends and I am anxious to introduce them to Blokus.
B004APVI1G|4.0|I wasn't really sure what the movie would be all about before my purchase, but was pleasantly surprised after watching the movie.  It was a great family movie that we watched with our two grandchildren, ages 4 and 5.  I was a little concerned that it may be too scary for them, especially when I heard that the 5 year old was afraid of owls.  While he sat on the edge of his seat thru the whole movie, he was not afraid.  He really liked the movie.
0441013597|1.0|Look, I love Herbert, and I love Dune, and I just got a Kindle for Christmas, so I figured I would get at least the first three books, but, guys? You might want to take a look at your pricing, there. I am NOT going to pay MORE for the Kindle edition than for the paperback. Particularly not for a book I already own, just for the convenience of reading it Kindle-ized. I hope that is some kind of silly, easily fixed error. Oh, and guys? Also not paying more than four bucks for an e-version a book as short as Dune Messiah. If the publishers are making you do this, feel free to forward this review to them.
B002P5XXR0|5.0|Being an avid Avatar fan, this soundtrack hits the right spots. As always the music is so beautifully haunting, and always brings to tears anyone who hears the album.  I pray that I can be re-born into: \\"Pandora\\" and live as a Na'vi warrior (my version of heaven I suppose)?? Yeah, I know people are saying right now: \\"get a life man!!\\"  But think about it if you will, where would you rather be if you had a choice??  For anyone who has seen the movie, they will connect with this soundtrack as they will recall the various scenes, and where that particular piece of music was heard within the movie.  Even if you have never seen the movie, this music raises feelings deep within your soul and psyche, very deep and moving!!    Overall, absolutely love the CD, and is within my collection of my best soundtracks and movie memorabilia.    Thank you
B000GTLQXU|3.0|You know the story. A cruise ship turns upside down due to a rogue wave. Everyone now walks on ceilings, and the only way out of here is to travel upwards until the bottom of the ship (technically the top of the now-sunken ship) is reached. I've seen both the original 1972 version and this new 2006 remake, and I have to say that I prefer the original. Poseidon isn't really terrible, but it has plenty of faults. The acting is poor, the characters are unlikable, and the dialogue feels forced. The special effects, however, are much better than the effects in the original. There is a lot of computer effects that almost look real.<br /><br />I guess you can say that I found this to be an adequate film overall. It doesn't live up to the original, but it's worth it if you're looking for a standard popcorn movie.<br /><br />Grade: 5.8/10
B0013FSXSC|5.0|I found this version refreshing and surprisingly good, despite the odd casting of Richard Gere as Lancelot. I thought he'd be too modern and American for the part, but he does very well with it and (at 45) was still youthful, slim, fit and spry.<br />Of course casting Sean Connery was perfect, Julia Ormond was well-cast with her fresh-faced European beauty and vulnerable yet regal air and Ben Cross is perfectly cold and threatening as the villianous Malagant.  The supporting cast of knights (a handsome group), handmaids and denisons of Leonesse &amp; Camelot are all very good as well.<br /><br />This version has no Merlyn or witchcraft, and though the Christian elements remain, it's still magical.<br />Centering on Lancelot's characterization as told in  Malory's 'Le Morte d'Arthur', it's a simpler version of clear human reality, free of the usual intellectualized symbolic interpretations, focusing on the love triangle between Lancelot, Guinever and Arthur.<br />The principle characters are well-developed, the sets and costuming correspond well to the characters.  The longing between Lancelot and Guiniviere is palpable, yet... well I won't to spoil it for you.<br />There's wonderfully written dialogue, well-paced action, excellent cinematography and editing, crisp night scenes, beautiful music, wonderful costumes and sets. Camelot looks a bit Hollywoodized yet elegant and Malagant's black slate ruined 'cave castle' is inspired.<br /><br />I found it well-crafted entertainment that turns like the pages of a storybook.<br /><br />**** Highly RECOMMENDED  - Ages 10+ (violence; no nudity or language concerns)
B0043A0PXU|1.0|I read a few reviews of this CD before I bought it. Some said good, a few said not so good. I thought this CD would be different and interesting. This CD is BAD.It sounds like it was recorded in her garage, and she was having a bad voice day, or week. Sorry, Annie.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|Can you imagine Has Solo saying that to Jabba the Hut? I've often wondered why Lucas wasted all that money and effort on this one scene; the scene prior to Han Solo and company blasting off from Mos Isely in Episode 4 - A new Hope. The scene was redundant the CGI just plain awful.<br /><br />And what was wrong with Darth Vader's line in \\"Empire Strikes Back\\" where a dejected Vader says to his staff \\"Bring my shuttle\\" after Luke rejects Vader in on Bespin. Why did Lucas, for no apparent reason, hire someone who doesn't sound very much like James Earl Jones to speak the one line \\"Alert my star destroyer to prepare for my arrival.\\" The line adds nothing to the scene.<br /><br />Episode 6 was just plain silly even in the theatrical version and should have served as a warning to the fans of what was coming in episodes 1 - 3.<br /><br />I've been a Star Wars fan since the beginning. I've spent a small fortune buying every new release of the original trilogy from the original release on VHS tape, (which my son wore out) to multiple wide screen versions on VHS in a variety of box sets, to at least two other box set releases on DVD.<br /><br />Here is where I draw the line. That's it George, you've seen the last of my money if you don't release the theatrical version on Blu-ray. Oh and I don't care what version the \\"prequel\\" trilogy is released. I got suckered into Episode 1 and was disgusted with Episode 2 and refused to buy Episode 3. So Blu-Ray is not an option here.<br /><br />Well, at least Peter Jackson leaned a valuable lesson from George Lucas. His extended versions of the Lord of the Rings was worth buying. I am waiting for the extended editions to be released on Blu-Ray. Until then, the DVD version will do for now on my upconverting Blu-Ray player player.
B002M2T1UO|5.0|The Shield is nothing less than pure brilliance; the storyline and characters are enthralling from the first to last seasons. Shawn Ryan's gritty drama shows Los Angeles' real situation as a city with glamour on the surface, but its underbelly is a seething mass of violence and disillusionment that occurs in any urban environment, despite the image that most people hold. Every member of the cast gave memorable, unbelievably strong performances; given that the cast is so large, again praise must be given to Mr. Ryan and Kurt Sutter for creating storylines that make each character integral. Michael Chiklis as Mackey (definitely a play on Machiavelli) was sheer genius because he captured what we fear in police officers: the ones who make one decision to become as brutal and mercenary as the criminals they claim to protect us from, under \\"the shield\\" of justice and morality. Walton Goggins was indeed menacing as the \\"apprentice\\" Shane; this actor was a joy to watch each episode, and along with the simply indomitable CCH Pounder, deserves high marks and awards for his courage in undertaking a very vulnerable and difficult role: these two actors will be the most memorable for me, as Glenn Close and Forest Whitiaker (sic) are a given as masters in any role they are in. By all means, buy the whole series, and see every fantastic actor push themselves in this remarkable program. A classic!
B004IV1GYQ|3.0|The lead actress, Sally Hawkins, owns this movie. Brilliant acting. In the usual style of Mike Leigh, this film examines the lives of working-class Londoners. Don't be fooled by the title - this isn't a comedy, it's a searing portrait of how people are today - abused children in the home, alienated, angry driving teachers, lonely women who binge drink. That the main character, Poppy, can keep her hopes and spirits up is a testament to the British working-class, and how they use humor to cope. Poppy calls herself \\"lucky,\\" but nobody in this unsparing film has found their bed of roses. At the end, as Poppy and her flatmate go boating in the park, Poppy's new love interest calls on her cell. . .maybe romance will lift her from the \\"tough bits\\" of daily London life.
B0012GMXSS|4.0|This album brings back some old memories. Songs are still awesome and how they did not become more widely known goes beyond me. The quality of sound is excellent. All the songs are great and there was one sing on this album I didn't expect so that was a bonus. If you liked or still like indie or grunge rock than this is an album you want.

1594202842|1.0|first i read the book so dont go there.  i kept feeling this si what it must have felt like in germany in the 1930s to be a kid, told how to act, what to do, how to do it, who you could talk to,not talk to and what you ahd to do to please authority.  sad kids today have to dela with this abuse which is what it is.  call your kids garbage, threaten them with violence,  wheres the authorities or because she is Yale professor and is not poor she can get away with this abuse.  also wheres the father in all of this, he thinks this is acceptable?  we wonder why chinese children have high suicide rate, here is the awnswer.  Authour should be ashamed of herself not proud, she created children who will enter the real world and be exposed to cruelty becuase they are wierd, eccentric, timid and unassimulated to firends as they enver had them.  sorry sorry world that this has gotten publicity and some good.
0312356854|5.0|This book was mesmerizing, haunting, beautiful and very much enjoyed.  I have shared it with many friends who are readers and they felt the same way.  I hope she continues to provide more inspiring books for us.
B002SJKWZ4|5.0|This was a gift for my girlfriend, and we have absolutely loved it. It is fun to see people's reaction when you turn on the tv with a flick of the wrist and turn up the volume just by rotating the the wand on its axis. Is it just as practical as a normal remote? No, but that isn't the point anyway.
0307593525|5.0|Before i ordered this set i was not sure that i would be able to be successful in preparing french dishes. However, the recipes are written in such a way that anyone can follow them and create a beautiful, delicious dish. The instructions are easy to understand and the illustrations seem to appear just when you need them.<br />So far i have served the bouef bourgonine and the wellington. Both were amazing. The creamed spinach is worth every moment of preparation; bon appetite!
B000A7DVR2|4.0|AS a movie, it was just OK,,,, but there are some really great lines in it...and it does have a huge cult following..
B000002540|4.0|this is a great live cd of their early stuff and it's still great to hear even today. This is melodic metal done boc 70's style , and it just shines here. The only thing lacking is a remaster for this one and all the rest of their catalog too though. At least up to the revolution by night cd.  Oh well, we at least got some good stuff here but it does need remastering sound wise. although live recording was rather primitive in comparison to todays superclear methods it can still be improved. THis one is still a must for boc fans and melodic metal fans as well as the tracks include smokin versions of me 262 , and other classics too. And I love the title the band needs to go harder again and make a song actually called 'on your feet or on your knees'.  Anyways this is prime stuff and worth grabbing.
1400079144|5.0|I was impressed with this new book.. with history found in the US!! And in our capital...nicely done. A great mix of history, masons, religion, and science all rolled into one.
B002ZG98C8|5.0|As the title suggests, this movie is very much a campy cheesy good time. It's like eating an extra large extra cheese pizza with all the toppings all by yourself, you know it's not going to be beneficial in anyway but boy was it a lot of fun!<br /><br />You can find a lot of parallels between the plotline of this movie and today's newspaper headlines, which I'm sure to a certain extent is what inspired Robert Rodriguez while he was writing the screenplay. There's comedy, action and enough blood and violence that would even make Freddy Krueger jealous!<br /><br />I personally love the low budget feel to this movie, it fits perfectly with the over the top violence and gritty story telling. If you're looking for something else other than 3D, a high budget special effects thrill ride or an animated kids movie than this is it, you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />The cast spans from \\"A\\" list celebs to \\"B' rated stars to even Enquirer faithfuls such as Lindsay Lohan. All of which fill their respected roles beautifully and with lots of charm. Believe it or not, Machete is a good time, offering something different then most everything else that's available today.<br /><br />Michael
0312600844|2.0|This book intrigued me for the first 50 pages or so and then I had the hardest time picking it up after that.  The only reason I finished it was because it was for my book club. None of the characters have ANY redeeming qualities, and I found it really hard to relate to anyone or thing in this book.  When I don't care or relate to any aspect of the book it's considered a 'dud' in my opinion.
030746363X|5.0|The information in this book just works, It covers a wide range of our physical well-being and the most efficient way of making those parts of our lives better. Each chapter alone is worth three times as much as you'll pay for the whole book. A must buy for anyone looking to lose weight, gain muscle, prevent/recover from injury naturally, sleep better, and have better sex!

B0015DROBO|5.0|Just finished the last book of the three book series.  I loved them!!! I wanted each book to go on and on.  I especially enjoyed the way each book seamlessly began with the end of the previous book.  Wish there were more...[[ASIN:B0015DROBO The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo]]It kept me wanting more and more.  I received a Kinkle for Christmas and have already read 3 books.  It is so simple to download the book and enjoy. I couldn't wait to get home from work and pick it up and read.  The dictionary function is great too.
B001FB55HQ|3.0|Terminator Salvation is the fourth in the Terminator series. It's also the lesser of the four. The first three starred Ah-Nuld, and were great because of him. Terminator Salvation stars Christian Bale and is slightly above average in spite of him. The action is good, the Terminators are great (including that one that looks identical to Arnold S. circa 1984), but the story isn't. They just don't make action movies the way they used to, when they not only had good action, but they also had something to entertain you even when something wasn't blowing up. When nothing is being shot or blown up onscreen, Terminator: Salvation is pretty boring. Still, I'd take Terminator: Salvation over Transformers, Iron Man 2, and G.I. Joe.
B0017KIBAI|5.0|Little white Gamecube controller, you match so perfectly with my Wii. Your cord, a full three meters, can face the challenge of sitting on the couch AND using a wired controller. Your buttons, a format that has stood the test of time for over nine years, has given me everything I needed when I only bought you to play Smash Bros.<br /><br />I apologize for geeking out, but I've been wanting a white Gamecube controller ever since the launch. The longer cord was an unexpected perk, so I find myself doubly loving it. Thank you, white Gamecube controller. Your colour and Japanese packaging make me feel special, and I wouldn't want you any other way.
B003R0LBVW|5.0|I was surprised to see the average Amazon review for this book was at three-stars - it may not be for everyone, but I enjoyed it immensely and would rank it among the top books I read in 2010. After finishing it, I immediately gave \\"The Corrections\\" a try but found it harder to get into.
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|Great movie. A classic. Has one of the best endings in a movie. Love it!! I have visited the area where this movie was filmed in Mansfield and Ashland, OH. (Also, Malabar Farm). The prison is in Mansfield. Very facinating. Worth the trip.
0142410373|5.0|I first read \\"Matilda\\" when it first came out years ago, and I can still well remember the impact this seemingly simple but very far-reaching tale made on me at the time. In his child heroine, the brilliant, sensible and ultimately deserving child Matilda, Mr Dahl has created a classic role model many adults in our fast-paced, self-serving society had best stand back and take a closer look at. By creating a child prodigy who is undervalued, disliked and misunderstood by almost everyone around her including her own family, despite the fact this is intended as a children's book Mr Dahl takes a very distinct swipe at the shallow values that underpin our own society, and encourages children everywhere to see others for who and what they are and not what they look like or how popular they are.    Matilda Wormwood is an accomplished self-taught prodigy by the time she is five years old. However, this quiet, modest child is just tolerated by her self centered, shallow family, headed by her criminally inclined car salesman father who does not appreciate Matilda's shrewd observations about his crooked dealings! Life for this stifled child centres around visits to the local library and keeping out of her parents' way when they are watching soapies and so-called reality shows on the TV (the extent of their cultural life! Sound familiar to many?) Whenever she is mistreated in any way, Matilda responds by some wonderfully ingenious pratical jokes that in true Roald Dahl style are quirky, inventive and very graphic, such as putting peroxide into her father's black hair dye bottle!    Upon reaching school age, Matilda is finally sent to the local school, and at long last meets a soulmate in her sweet-natured, understanding new teacher, Miss Honey, who recognises the remarkable potential in this small child. However, the school is ruled by the iron fist of ex-Olympic athlete, Agatha Trunchbull, a snorting rhinoceros of a woman who regards children as a personal enemy. The tyranny of the Headmistress extends across the staff as well as the children - and when Miss Trunchbull takes out her spleen on Matilda, who discovers some very nasty truths about the tyrant headmistress and her relationship with the oppressed Miss Honey, the stage is set for Matilda's inventive genius to wreak the ultimate vengeance.    Perhaps this book's greatest achievement is the strong theme of mind over matter, a theme many children would do best to grasp. Matilda's frustrated brilliance finds a most unexpected release through psychic energy and in her ability to perform some truly magical Uri Geller style tricks (for more detail read the book). Although this book is now over 20 years old, its appeals remains fresh regardless of the generational gap. Brains over beauty, goodness over brute force - Matilda is neither stuck up, conceited or self confident but a sweet, modest child who is simply wanting to earn some honest respect in her life. This theme has strongly inspired some of my own writing as it is a theme I believe modern media has very sadly missed. For any parent, especially those with daughters, this book is a very definite must.
B003J27WFW|5.0|If you're expecting to go Beyond The Lighted Stage to get a full history of Why Rush Is Here, this is a complete MUST HAVE. It takes you from the current of when it was filmed, which was on tour, I'm guessing for either the R30 or Snakes and Ladders Tour, into the beginnings of the band from when John Rutsey was there, to the arrival of Neil and the thoughts of Geddy and Alex when Neil showed, some of thoughts of where some of the albums were going musically, into the tragedy that Neil faced in the 90s. Some of the artists that appear in this also share their thoughts; the one that actually hit close to home was Billy Corgan from The Smashing Pumpkins. Honestly, be prepared to laugh, maybe shed some tears along the lines, and DON'T SHUT OFF THE CREDITS. (Believe me, you'll either thank me later or call me names for saying that, but this is coming from someone who usually shuts off the credits.) The bonus DVD is a dream line up of some things that didn't make the movie in its entirety and live tunes. This set PROVES why they earn the title of Working Men of the rock industry.<br />I did see this movie first on TV, but had to have it in my own collection, not to mention when watching on TV, commercial breaks were getting a little annoying.
B0002YLC24|2.0|I thought this was going to be a romance story about two people who belonged together and had found one another again...against all odds. No such luck.     It was just 80 minutes of \\"peeking into someone's window\\" and eavesdropping on a private conversation.  Rather boring. They both seemed rather self-absorbed and jaded. All they seemed to be able to talk about was their one-night stand 9 years ago, and how their lives (and subsequent lovers) had seemed meaningless ever since.    Duh. Meaningless sex is SUPPOSED to make you feel completely empty and leave you dragging around baggage of the soul tie to that person for the rest of your life. Why do you think that so many people are currently yearning for the romance, the depth, the committment of courtships of yesteryear? You know...LOVE...not the cheap imitation - lust.  The kind of relationship where the couple give sacrificially for the benefit of the others in the family...never stab one another in the back...cover one another in protection...encourage one another to become a better human being...encourage one another to follow their (unselfish) dreams...stay completely faithful until death. If swans can do it, I think that it shouldn't be too big a stretch for humans.     He complains that he has had to do things that he never thought he would have to for the sake of his marriage...light candles, read self-help books, go to counseling. Really?! Does anybody truly believe that those are extraordinary measures that a spouse should not have to take in order to preserve his family and keep his wedding vows for life????    I wanted to toss my cookies when he justified his intention to dissolve his marriage. I wondered what terrible thing his wife had done to be cheated on and abandoned. Had she committed adultery? Become a drug or alcohol addict? Lost all of their money on gambling? Nope. It was because he didn't want to \\"wake up\\" in his 50's and realize that he had stayed married for his little boy's sake and had thrown away his chance for happiness with someone else.     Why is it that the most self-centered, lazy people are the ones who are always abandoning their commitments in order to chase down some fantasy \\"happiness\\" that might be just around the corner? Don't they realize that happiness isn't \\"found\\"; it is created with a lot of hard work and sacrifice?    Someone that selfish shouldn't be allowed to breed. It's pretty obvious that he fully intends to commit adultery with her, and she will most likely cheat with him and betray her boyfriend. Charming duo! Maybe if I had seen the first movie, I would have had some sympathy for this couple and their yearning for what might have been.    But on second thought...it was only sex with a stranger during a one night stand...so probably not. YUCK!!
B003R0LBVW|1.0|I try to give every book a fair chance by reading to the end with perpetual hope. Could not finish this book no matter what. So incredibly boring.  Could not feel love or hate for any of the characters. Only disgust. One loser after another. Somebody got paid financially or otherwise in return for good reviews.
8862933177|5.0|I bought this journal for my daughter. She has another journal for books and since she's so into old movies this was her next request. It's a very well made product. It's got room for plenty of notes and the quality is very good. She has 2 and loves them and has no complaints. And isn't that what it's all about with the kids. :)  Carol L.

0307266303|5.0|If you are a runner or are interested in running you cannot miss this book. If you are just looking for a great story narrated with mastery you will not stop reading this book till you reach the end. I am grateful with the author for learning about mankind's runner nature, for transporting me inside the Copper Canyons witnessing the greatest race ever, and as a Mexican, for learning from him about the marvelous Tarahumara people. Just two days ago, the day after I finished reading this book I saw a group of young Tarahumaras in downtown Mexico City and I could not feel overwhelmed actually watching them in their colorful blouses, skirt and sandals, you will know what I mean when you read the book.
B001IB63KQ|5.0|the product is in excellent shape.  it works great - the preformance is amazing!  i'm very pleased. the product arrived very fast.  there was no problem .
B000Y9PILI|2.0|I grew up listening to this album. I know it like the back of my hand. The original version is moving and I have it on vinyl. I was so excited to purchase it on cd because I have been hunting for it for years. BEWARE! It is not the same album.<br />The re-mixes sounds flat and over produced. The raw mood on \\"Chicago\\" for instance is gone and replaced with a slicker sound and the addition of certain background vocals that were never there in the first place. The over all sound of the re-mix makes the track sound thin. On the original version of the album you really felt the vibe of revolution. It was powerful and urgent sounding. You wanted to go to Chicago. You felt you could change the world. This new version sounds like someone removed from the whole event is telling the story in a restrained manner. The overall effect is unemotional and falls flat. It's like the difference between a witness and a participant, and in this new mix the singer wasn't there.<br />I wanted to weep. Especially for the price I paid. Plus, what the heck is going on with this trend to include a DVD with every reissued CD? If I want a DVD I will buy a DVD thank you very much. I don't need the price of my cd jacked up so I can see someone reflect in an interview on the original process.<br />Overall, disappointing. Don't get me wrong, it's still a terrific album, but the opportunity to reach a new audiance may be lost because they just couldn't leave well enough alone.
B00337KM2S|5.0|George Clooney, Vera Farmiga and Anna Kendrick give the best performances of their careers in Jason Reitman's Up in the Air.  In the movie (an adaptation of Walter Kim's novel), Clooney plays a man that flies around the country to fire people and business is booming.  He is a man that values a life free from any kind of connections or attachments whatsoever and treasures his 300 plus days of life on the road.  In fact he is shooting for 10,000,000 frequent flyer miles that would make him part of a selected group of individuals.  While on the road, he meets Vera Farmiga's character.  As she puts it, she is exactly like him but has a vagina.  When he returns home, he is introduced to Anna Kendrick's character.  She wants to computerize the firing process in order to reduce costs.  Fearing that his life on the road is in jeopardy, he takes her on the road with him to show her that firing people face to face is better than doing it over a computer screen.  There are many things that make this film unique.  Real life victims of firing were in the film and they relived some of their experiences.  Another thing is that we end up liking Clooney's character even though he can be a very unlikable one at times.  We see his entire philosophy in action but end up liking and feeling sorry for him by the end of the film.  That is a remarkable feat in itself.  Finally, there are many ways to describe this film.  One could say that it is a film about a man that goes around the country firing people.  Another could say it is about a man trying to obtain 10,000,000 frequent flyer miles.  Another could say that is about a man finally willing to make a connection with another person.  One more could say that it is about the country's recession.  In fact, it is all of these.  Jason Reitman deserves credit for being able to combine comedy and drama in order to create not only one of the best films of 2009 but also one of the best films ever made.
0316098337|4.0|It's a moving account of how a mother takes care of her child physically and emotionally in the face of the most terrible circumstances, allowing him to be free of each troubling issue until he's ready to hear it. Parents do this daily and the author makes this a focal point of the relationship. It's also a surprising POV and the 5yr old feels real. It simplified things in an enlightening way. I realized once again how difficult it is to imagine things beyond what I've been taught - that a limited education or lack of travel or exposure to other people and cultures stifles creativity and what an individual views as possible. Finally, it's a story of courage and that's what I'm left with - the courage of an adult in dealing with what she knows, and that of a child in dealing with what he doesn't - \\"scave\\" is what she tells him to be when he's fearful but has to do something important anyway, scaredy brave.
030745455X|1.0|I read the first one which was pretty good.  this one was so bad, that I ended up skimming after approximately 200 pages.  Will not read another of his books.  There is an article about Stieg Larsons books in the The New Yorker 1/10/11, which is far more interesting than this book is.  That I can recommend and why I am commenting on this site.
B0011Z31V8|5.0|If you partied like it was 1999 and sang Little red Corvette ,you will love this CD. Gets me going in the car and keeps me singing on my way to work . Classics just never die ......
B0042AGNCS|1.0|This film just slaughters the characters from both comic book franchises (Ultimate and Classic Universe) and the previous two films. This film made me want to cry to tears of sadness because it is so bad and walk out the theater. Characters, especially Topher Grace as Venom is totally miscast and Sam Rami wasted too much time on Sandman who is a D listed villain at best, even in the comics. Sam Rami also did nothing to portray Venom properly. He should of just took his time to develop Venom properly and while focusing on the drama between Harry and Peter while also ditching Sandman completely. Don't even get me started on the emo Spiderman/Peter Parker arch because its not dark just very lame. So lame in fact I almost walked out. Also not enough action sequences and the one that are there, have the characters without their mask way too often. If you must watch this, RENT IT because it isn't worth your money to add it to your collection of films.
B004B8DH98|2.0|Simply put, this movie was a little slow.  It felt like a few themes were left unexplored or unresolved or maybe I was just too bored to notice they had been resolved.  It looks like the trailers over-marketed this movie as they commonly do with Clooney films.  If you're a diehard Clooney fan, this movie might be a subpar diversion.
0307595579|5.0|I had already read The Girl Who Played with Fire, but wanted very much to read the other books in this trilogy by Stieg Larsson so when I saw this version offered as a boxed set I decided to purchase it.  I have not been disappointed in my purchase; the set is physically attractive and I enjoy Larsson's writing - it is too bad that he is no longer available to author any more books.
B004CEUEWE|2.0|I found this movie dragged in parts.  I was told it was alot like Heat with the exception that Heat had more heart to it - I actually felt something for those characters.  These characters sold the \\"scumbag\\" theme a little too well.  I didn't care about them and when they were killed off, it was more of a relief.<br /><br />Some of the themes from Goodwill Hunting returned in this movie.  I was not impressed by the irony.<br /><br />This was really not worth the time.  Maybe being shown on TV will breath new life into it.
0143116738|3.0|I bought this book because the author will be in town and we were required to read The Element before his presentation.  I have enjoyed  reading the examples and  there are several effective sayings that I have written down to remember and use in the future.  I have read other books along this line so the content was not new but I am always looking for good books to read and discuss and I look forward to hearing the author  next month.
0393334988|5.0|I had to pick up a used copy of this off eBay years ago.  I am glad to see it is now available here.  It is a horrifying, compelling, and inspiring story, made all more poignant by the autobiographical first person account.
075666733X|5.0|This was a gift for my sister who is in-training/in-school finish her pre-reqs for nursing school. Highly recommend this. Wanted to keep it for myself because it's such an amazing book.
030746363X|4.0|Tim says at the beginning of the book NOT to read it all cover to cover but to dip into the chapters that are right for you. PLEASE HEED HIS ADVICE. There is a lot of information and you can get confused or overwhelmed by all the information.<br /><br />I really loved aspects of this book, even though it's geared much more towards men. Take the information that resonates with you and just give it a try.<br /><br />I would have loved to see a lot more summary chapters, checklists or a day to day planner or something because it can be hard to figure out exactly what to do. Take notes as you go.<br /><br />I loved the Four Hour Work Week, and love Tim's approach to the body too. It's no-nonsense and full of surprising gems.
B002ZG981E|5.0|This may have been one of the best films of 2010 and getting it on Blu Ray for this price just made it a no brainer. Christopher Nolan's passion piece deserves the aesthetic presentation an HD release affords it, and it's the kind of movie you have to own because it's the kind of movie you have to watch over and over.
B000003CMC|5.0|A true Allman Brothers Band classic. This album contains some of their finest works that have endured the test of time.
B0037A4ILC|5.0|This movie paints a vivid picture of the experiences of the main characters.  You can step into the shoes of any of them and feel what they felt.  In contrast to modern day mountaineers, these old-school climbers made up for the lack of high-tech equipment with gumption and grit, wills of steel and plain old bravery.  You will admire them for their humanity, whether they succeed or not, or even if they wore Nazi uniform.  Viewers who are non-climbers will have no trouble identifying with the constant and opposing pull between hope and fear that they faced through out their ordeal, when each decisions carries the gravitas of life or death.  Viewers who are climbers will have an additional gut-wrenching understanding of the agony of having to retreat from a first ascent so close to completion.    The visual effect of this movie is also excellent.  With appropriate use of contrasting colors and lighting between the hotel and the wall, the sunny days and the snowstorm, special effects of the blizzard, close up and panorama views of the ascent, it puts you emotionally close to the characters and at the same time, fully aware of the bigger context that they are in.    This is one of the best mountain films to date.
0784011710|1.0|This review is only on the 1998 DVD release. This is a horrible transfer if you're going to play it on a hi-def tv. The movie is letterboxed for regular tv so it shows up surrounded by a black frame (which might not be so bad if you have a 72\\" LED TV but sucks if your screen is smaller!). Also, the colors are kinda blurry and washed out. I zoomed in to fill the screen but that's a poor substitute...I hope the studios get their act together and do a really good blu ray edition of this haunting classic movie!
B003WTE886|5.0|Ok, so she grew on me a little, enough to buy THIS CD.  I don't think she is a terrific singer, but I wanted to hear the whole thing so I bought it.
B0000AFQS0|2.0|I picked this up based on my memories of watching it many years ago and I was disappointed by how boring I found it.  Sure, the footage was kinda cool in spots, but as a film it just has not aged well.  There is far better footage circulating amongst collectors which leads me to believe that a much better movie could be made.  If you are a rabid Who fan (which I am not) then you will love it....if you are looking to relive the thrill of what you experienced when you saw it \\"back in the day\\" then it might not be for you.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|Temple Grandin has revolutionized the world of food animal handling and processing,animal handling in general, as well as how to help people with autism, all the while struggling with autism herself.  She is brilliant, unique, and has a world wide effect on animal treatment and the treatment of autism.  The portrail of her was absolutely perfect!
1599218011|5.0|FINALLY!  a book that has it all and speaks so directly to \\"ME\\"!!!!!!  This book is to be savored.  It woke me right up and has me listening...and let me tell you, THAT is a near impossible thing to achieve!  Humor, facts, inspiration, truth, wisdom, beauty, a path made doable...ALL here is this amazing book.  Thank you Kris!!!!!!!!!!!
B001C4AFOY|4.0|Enjoyed the movie with the lavish Victorian atmosphere, clothing, descriptions of England during the time.  The complicated issues of being a young queen and her relationship with albert were interesting.
B00004W50T|4.0|What sets this album apart, historically, is the fresh approach to how 'folk' music can be presented. Dylan shocked the world a few years earlier by introducing the electric guitar into his music, and the Newport Folk Festival, getting booed and charged with 'selling out' in the process.<br /><br />Here we have a culmination of the integration of contemporary instrumentation into the more organic song writing process. Call this the 'original' \\"Americana\\" album. Mellencamp and so many others, even Country musicians, would later adopt this as their standard procedure, adapting it to their particular style in the process.<br /><br />The songs. The songs are great, yet also a bit inconsistent. This is why this album is not for everyone. Unless you really love the writing style of Robertson and company, you will find some of the songs very unappealing. Without calling out specific tunes, there are a few absolute gems which are now classic Band signature pieces here.<br /><br />And in this way, you get to hear the very first incarnation and the beginning of the process and development of one of the most enduring sounds and bands in the American landscape, telling the stories - which is really the best form of song writing - nobody else was telling outside the mountain music we now call 'Bluegrass' and early 'Country'.
B000QQH4YS|5.0|I love Robocop. I was a kid when it came out, but it is still a lot of fun to watch. Okay, so many people don't like violent movies. Well then this movie is definitely not for them. Despite its negative and sometimes overblown views of the hostility of Detroit, this movie is also a tale of the human spirit. This man, a decent and good policeman, has been put through hell, lost his family, his identity, and his independence. What I like about the movie is that he is not seeking revenge, but justice. The clever ending makes it so worthwhile. Excellent film, with the spirit of true heroism.
0140120416|4.0|Any book on learning a language is going to be difficult to rate.<br /><br />I was learning Russian because I began attending a Russian church. I had been fascinated by Russia since a child (my brother married a Ukrainian woman way back in 1966). Amazing people, amazingly complex language.<br /><br />For me, this book served well. The companion 10,000 most common words volume Brown also put out was also a major help.<br /><br />But, as with any language, you should surround your self, or be able to make conversation with a native speaker. They will help you will so much more than can be elucidated in a book.<br /><br />Yeah, difficult review to make. But this book did a good job of presenting the material. You just need a native to help you make better sense of it \\"in context\\".
B0044XV3QY|5.0|I saw Avatar when it first came out in the theaters and was amazed at the sound, cinematography and special effects!  I didn't think that could be duplicated until I put this Blu-Ray set into my home theater!  In a word, Wow!  I do have a large plasma and surround sound system--but this Blu-Ray disc turns it into a seamless sensory experience!  You are literally on the moon Pandora!  Very impressive!  Didn't want the movie to end.  And the Director's Cuts just added to the enjoyment.  The extra disc which shows the painstaking but magical way that the movie was created is fascinating - a movie in its own right!  Highly recommended! And at a great price!
B0007Y08PQ|3.0|Okay, I've seen this movie twice. Once when it came out and again just recently after buying the DVD. So I have some perspective between the two viewings.<br /><br />This is 'standard' STNG fare, really. The quality of the imagery and graphics/EFX is cinematic quality, of course, but the story line is not. This is not to say the story is no good. It is good. But it should have been more.<br /><br />I guess this film, and the X that followed, demonstrate the fact that this series has run its course, with X being a very real failure in many ways, yet also watchable in a 'fan of the series' context.<br /><br />Not a grand review, I know. But unless you really are a fan, this film - and X - really are below the standard set, first with the series, and then in the transition to films. With the exception of ST V, which I will probably never actually own because it was so poorly executed, all the Star Trek films are good. It's just that these last two, Insurrection and X, were a disappointment when held up to what came before.
0060936223|4.0|I agree with most reviewers who found Patti Smith's memoir of her early years in New York and her account of her relationship with artist/photographer Robert Mapplethorpe to be moving. Besides her depiction of her muse-artist relationship with Mapplethorpe (each was the other's muse), I liked reading about New York in the 70s, a place and a time like none other. This book seems to fall into a genre I'm finding especially compelling these days--the dual biography. These tend to be less bogged down by detail and get right to the essence of what makes their subjects biography-worthy. If you're interested in dual biographis of artits, check out [[ASIN:1596914203 Tom and Jack: The Intertwined Lives of Thomas Hart Benton and Jackson Pollock]] and Elaine and Bill [de Kooning]: Portrait of a Marriage (now out of print).<br /><br />My warning to Kindle readers: The Kindle edition does not include any of the photographs found in the print edition. These aren't essential to understanding Smith's narrative, but it would have been nice to see them as I was reading the book, especially since some were likely Mapplethorpe's.
B000002O51|3.0|The one thing that Tom Sholz suffered from over the course of these first three albums is that there seemed to be no 'growth', no progress.<br /><br />The songs are different, and yes, Amanda is great. But I want to see progress, movement forward, and that generally means the sonic signature of a writer, band, and production changes, particularly with so many years between them.<br /><br />But we are frozen in Sholz's laboratory and he has a process and method that works for him. Okay, fine. I'm okay with that, really.<br /><br />The songs are, as usual, hit and miss. After so many years, this album should have been filled with sure winners all the way around.<br /><br />Well, not everyone will agree. That's okay, too.
B002ZG981E|5.0|I had to watch it about 3 times until i understood it. I think that you have to think too much into the movie to find out what is happing in the movie. Most people do not like that kind of movie. I loved the move and i think that lots of people who love movie should watch it.
B000KIPT30|4.0|I use this amplifier to boost the sound signal to my earphones when I watch TV without disturbing other viewers. It is a neat little package with four independent adjustable outputs, a pilot light, and no on-off switch.    It does its job of providing me with independent volume control for my headphones. It is awkward to set up, and unless you have some experience with audio equipment I suggest you get something else. I gave it a four star rating because it does not have an on-off switch which means you have to provide some way of switching the power on and off, or unplug it and then plug it in again which is a bad idea. However, this amplifier has greatly enhanced my TV watching experience.
B002HFWAWW|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie! It has a great futuristic feel of a world without warmth or feeling. Really delves into what it means to be human. It is a pretty heavy movie; I don't think the actors smile in the course of the film, but it was a great watch! Christian Bale doing what he does best!
B004A8EI9M|5.0|I'm not a big fan of these types of movies or shows - horror, zombie, or gore.  However, this show is so clever.  It keeps you in suspense and surprises you just when you think you can predict what happens next.  I really doubted I would enjoy this show and bought it just because there was a good deal.  I didn't expect much, but after this first episode, I can't wait to watch the next one.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|This is one of the best comedy cartoons for all ages ever!It is so funny I love the little minions.I would get this as a family movie it is a great one for everyone.
B003ZTQN1I|1.0|Extremely Disappointed    I really enjoyed the movie Country Strong and couldn't wait to get the original sound track.  Silly me, I actually thought a sound track was songs from the movie, exactly as they were sung in the movie.  Imagine my surprise when I discovered the song I couldn't wait to hear, `Give in to Me' was going to be sung by an artist that wasn't even in the movie.   The performance by Meester and Garret in the movie was over the top, and I am so disappointed the individual who produced the sound track didn't deem it worthy of the sound track.  Hugh mistake if you ask me.    I'm not saying the artist on the CD sound bad.  I just feel the Meester and Garrett did an excellent job and I really enjoyed listening to their voices.  I am sure if I would have had been able to locate the CD at a WalMart, Meijer or Target, I would have reviewed the songs and artists and I would more than likely not made the purchase.     While on one hand, I am disappointed by some of the song/artist selections, on the other hand, there are many good songs on the CD; `Chances Are' by Garret, `A Little Bit Stronger' by Sara Evans and `Words I couldn't  Say' by Meester.
B004132HZS|5.0|This is Sherlock Holmes for the 21st Century.    Plot - perfect    Characters - perfect    Performances - perfect    Several loving acknowledgements of the original Doyle plots, done is such a way as to both honor the original Holmes stories, move the new plot forward, but not rub our faces in how clever the writers have been in doing it.    I watched these episode in amazed happiness at how contemporary, smart, yet true to the original Holmes themes, is this production.    Don't waste time wondering if these are worth owning, just buy them!  You won't regret it.  They are a \\"must\\" for anyone who's ever found happiness in Sherlock Holmes stories.

B004DCB62M|1.0|I'm quite frustrated. This version is a nightmare. It is impossible to go to different short-stories as every single link within a collection leads you to the BEGINNING of the collection not of the story you are looking for.

B000BSLU2S|5.0|This is the best stuff I've heard, so I decided to buy it because I'm getting a new Motherboard. WOW, was I impressed. This dropped my AMD Phenom X4 810's temp by 11C!! I even overclocked it to 2.93Mhz (org 2.66Mhz) and at idle it's get only 30C MAX, when it's running 100% It's at 47C. I'm still using the stock fan fan too! This is a 100% worth it buy.<br /><br />I *HIGHLY* recommend this to ANYONE that needs replacement Thermal Paste or if your Over Clocking! (And at only ~$10, how can you go wrong?)
B003UESJH4|5.0|\\"The King's Speech\\" is superior filmmaking and acting with impeccable performances by Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush and with an outstanding contribution by Helena Bonham Carter. This is a deeply moving, deeply involving movie full of historical detail and the famous people of the thirties. I can't think of a recent movie that touched me like this one, and one that so satisfied me. The dramatic conflict between Firth and Rush is brilliantly done.<br />The man who became George VI (1936-1952) was a stammerer who dreaded becoming the monarch. With the caring tutelage of Lionel Logue (Rush) he is able to control his stuttering for the crucial speech inaugurating Britain's entry into World War II. The strategy of Rush revealed him as a brilliant and imaginative teacher. He was an Australian, a speech therapist, uncertified, but a man had helped many veterans of the Great War in their speech problems.<br /> It is instructive to remember that Carter is playing the queen consort who was the mother of the present Queen of England, Elizabeth II. The Queen Mother (or Queen Mum) died in 2002 at the age of 101.<br /> In the movie the Prince of Wales (Guy Pearce) is not depicted favorably, nor was he a figure to admire in real life. He married a twice-divorced American woman with a shady reputation, was pro-Hitler, and was a man who sponged off others in his long useless life after abdicating as King Edward VIII in 1936. He was called David within the family and Albert (later George VI) was called Bertie. In his teaching Rush insisted that Albert allow him to call him Bertie to break the barrier between sovereign and subject and taskmaster and pupil. Bertie's' father, King George V, was a tyrant who had no patience for his stammering son. Logue had to dig into Bertie's's past to find how and why he became a stutterer.<br /> In one crucial scene, the nasty wastrel, David, now king, cruelly apes Bertie's affliction and accuses him of wanting the throne--something that Bertie feared and hoped to avoid. How could his subjects put up with a king who couldn't speak eloquently and fluently?<br /> Bertie and Lionel have epic arguments in the movie. As part of the therapy Lionel gets Bertie angry so he'll yell and not stutter. He also gets him to sing his thoughts. The scene in which Logue tells Bertie to say all the dirty words he knows is a hilarious moment in the film. Logue builds self-awareness and confidence into Bertie, and eventually a deep and lasting friendship develops. The final minutes of the film when the king is giving his radio speech to the nation under the direction of Logue are thrilling and poignant. He becomes his own man and inspires his countrymen in their darkest hour. This film deserves an Oscar.o avoid. How could his subjects put up with a king who couldn't speak eloquently and fluently?

1594202842|5.0|I was totally blown away by this book, but not by what you'd expect.  I am admittedly concerned about a parenting method I believe creates more automatons incapable of creative genius, lacking bedside manner, or perhaps most importantly the suppression/extinction of human empathy.  From a totally different point of view, though, this book is a smashing success.  Consider only the debate that erupted.  She's a shoe-in for a multi-million dollar earner from this publication (just add the currently top Amazon position to the high six-figure advance.)  But it doesn't end there.  Get ready for the Oprah appearance, speaking circuit, and perhaps a movie is already penned?  I mean this in no sarcasm at all, Amy Chua is a genius.  Imagine being able to secure such a revenue stream in the space of: 8 weeks to write, a quick turn-around publishing, and the Wall Street Journal, NY Times, and every other major media picking up this story.  You can't buy this type of publicity.  Congratulations Amy, this was a marketing coup!  Which of course then asks the question to my lead-in; Amy's methods indeed are creative genius, her about-face on the methods and mea culpa about her early parenting do indicate human empathy, and finally when we all have the chance to meet her I'm sure a solid, respectable bedside manner will surly shine though.  This book offers far, far more than what we first suspect.  Bravo Amy, you are a perfectly executed marketing/sales success!  Five Stars!
B003F3NDWG|5.0|I have been addicted to this show since it debuted and season 2 is fabulous!  We learn more about Castle as well as Beckett and of course...Nikki Heat.  Humor with wit and mystery....fabulous!
B0036S4CTS|3.0|Good clever writting especially for the first third.  Characters, even minor characters, are well done and believeable.  The last third or so of the book tries to be heartwarming but falls flat.

B002EWD0I6|5.0|While some of BBC's early films may be lacking some polish, Larkrise to Candleford is an AMAZING, true to life drama that is well-filmed with actors/actresses that are PERFECT for the characters they portray! I would recommend this first season of Larkrise to Candleford to anyone who enjoys historical fiction drama. INCREDIBLE product!    The best deal for this season was found on Amazon.com

0061974307|4.0|SECRET DAUGHTER tells two heartbreaking stories, worlds apart but inseparably linked. The first is about infertility in North American woman and the extreme lengths that some hopeful mothers- and fathers-to-be will take to achieve the elusive goal of parenthood. The second graphically illustrates the demeaning treatment of women and girls in India combined with the overpowering social pressure that Indian women feel to bear sons. A common beginning breaks into two tales and then finds common ground once again at the conclusion of Shilpi Somaya Gowda's brilliant debut novel.<br /><br />Kavita Merchant, having had her first child heartlessly ripped away from her and simply \\"disposed of\\" in the manner of an unwanted chattel, defies her family, her husband and her culture's social mores to spirit her second child, Usha, into an orphanage. All that Kavita can bequeath to her daughter is a small silver bangle and life itself. Separated by two oceans, thousands of miles and an entire universe of cultural differences, Somer and Krishnan Thakkar, both successful doctors in North America are struggling with Somer's inability to conceive and carry a baby to full term. All attempts at producing their own child having failed, they reluctantly decide, in homage to Krishnan's ethnicity and his family, to adopt an Indian child from an orphanage in Mumbai. SECRET DAUGHTER is the story of two families and the life of the daughter who was given the gift of a chance at a life that nobody but her mother wanted her to have.<br /><br />Although Gowda's concerns and dismay over the Indian culture's preferential treatment for sons is clear enough, she does not (thankfully) indulge in heavy-handed proselytizing or hand-wringing. The story is quite shocking, compelling, absorbing and heartbreaking enough even when it is told in a relatively factual, straightforward, almost banal manner. Indeed, the effect on North American sensibilities may be more powerful and poignant for Gowda's presentation of the practice of killing unwanted daughters as simply the way it is. I'll confess to my western confusion over the matriarchs of Indian families who seem to have the bizarre ability to forget or ignore the fact that, at one point in their lives, they too were baby girls who were probably, at best, unwelcome additions to their families.<br /><br />Some readers will almost certainly be disappointed at the lack of closure that the finale of the story brings to all of its characters. For my money, this open-ended conclusion keeps SECRET DAUGHTER out of the potentiall pitfall of becoming trite or sappy. Life, after all, goes on. Families and cultures are dynamic, evolving things and, as individuals, our life on this earth is all too short. Our individual contributions are only a small part of that development. If we can all agree that the murder of infant Indian girls is unacceptable in a modern world whether it is in India or North America, then I think we can also agree that Shilpi Somaya Gowda, the novel SECRET DAUGHTER and the story of little Usha's life, has made a notable contribution toward that change.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />Paul Weissice of killing unwanted daughters as simply the way it is.

B00192IV0O|5.0|I love this record! It is very danceable! this album has the unmistakable club bounce and playful lyrical fervor fans expected. This is also a record inspired by the underground world of electro and rock-infused house music, and a world populated by raucous, all-night dance parties that are bubbling right now in every major city around the glodbe. This record is not just a new sound but its a celebration that change is happening.
B003YMNVCA|5.0|It is great book! I subscribe to every good word about this book said by other. Despite its intimidating title, it is clearly written, wit, and easy to read. It is very informative and fills you with great knowledge. Great job!
B00428ZRFE|5.0|I absolutely love this record! It is enjoyable. This is her return to the uptempo dance grooves of her earlier records.  This album is quite a varied dance collection with a couple of deeply thought numbers, naturally, offering several ready club hits at once. This album is also a reflection of her essence. This album really offers the images and moods that the audience has been valuing about her from the very beginning. Her goal was to make this album free of filler. Rihanna has did it again!

0802798225|5.0|Alex is a guy who was forced in a bad crowed, Brittany is known as a good girl with high expectations. At first I didn't know how this would be an interesting story, but the way Simone Elkeles writes it is beyond genius. The chapters go back and fourth through out both characters events. We get to know the characters faster knowing what both their stories are and how they feel about each other.    I agree with some people - the story does get a little too sweet sometimes - but that's how Alex and Brittany grow as characters. My favorite types of books are characters that are relatable and change in every chapter. They learn from their mistakes and support each other without meaning too. (which makes it more entertaining)    It was an addicting read, you always want to know what happens next. I suggest this book for readers who like romance, coming of age, chick lit, and a little humor.
B00192IV9U|5.0|No, Mike didn't put his final touches on this CD; however, a great job was done by those who did attempt the \\"Mikey-touch!\\"  I'm happy MJ worked w/nothing but the best, & they stepped forward to @ least try to make MJ proud!    Being familiar w/Mike's music, yes, I can tell where some of the ad-lib inserts (from other songs & concerts) have been added.  Again, great job!    I just wish SONY had had some kind of marketing strategy in place :-(  This was an even more pitiful job of marketing, than the effort they put forth for \\"INVINCIBLE.\\"    \\"Monster\\" should have been released, first (IMHO).  \\"Behind The Mask,\\" second.  \\"(I Can't Make It) Another Day,\\" third.     I LOVE this CD!  I can't stop playing it :-D !
B000A2WF3S|5.0|Not much to add to the other reviews... this album IS the work of an absolute master violinist... except to comment on the quality of the recording. It's absolutely wonderful. The range and tone from Kremer's searing violin is breathtaking in its musicality and almost other-worldly in its sound-stage and icy clarity. I've never heard a recording with this kind of white-hot sound... spectacular.
B004498KPU|4.0|Remastered, huh?  Oh yeah? I've downloaded videos from YouTube in better condition.    I give the set 4 Stars****, overall, because I don't want to penalize the artist or the content, ONLY the `digital' quality of the content.  DANG Sony!    1. I noticed some of the videos are a little crisper, but not all of them.  2. Some are standard & some are widescreen ...  3. The audio on \\"Smooth Criminal\\" is atrocious.  It goes in & out, & at one      point, you can barely hear Mike singing...  4. \\"You Rock My World\\" is shortened in the craziest places...  5. Too many songs are out-of-sync.  Lip-flap before or after the words are sung.      (maybe, I'm the only one experiencing this...?)  6. The Coup-de-gras: An OUT-OF-TUNE beat-box remix of \\"Blood On The Dance      Floor.\\" Sony could have included Mike's version & not just the remix!    To say I'm disappointed is an understatement.  (I'll say it, again)  To say I'm disappointed is an understatement.    (...also, kudos to Marc Richardson for his outstanding review! HUGE Thanx!)
030746363X|5.0|I have read Tim Ferris' blog for a while now and am familiar with many of his weight loss/gain, muscle gain and diet techniques. I was worried the book would just be his blog posts nicely edited in book form. I was entirely impressed that this is in no way the case. He takes the ideas from his blog and expands upon them, showing real world samples of his body hacks.<br /><br />This book is not for obsessives who want to count and measure every detail. I have seen websites pop up with spreadsheets on how to do EVERYTHING suggested in the book. I feel this misses the whole point of 4-hour body. Shouldn't we be living our life while controlling our bodies? That's the one part that is missing from this book, a chapter at the end reminding people that this should change your life but not consume it. Find the elements you need and enjoy and work it into your life. You don't have to do everything, and the many examples in the book try to show this.<br /><br />Regardless, somewhere in the beginning, Tim Ferris says he just wants people to walk away thinking this book changed their life. It has changed mine. I've incorporated a few of his ideas into my current plan--kettle bell, ice water, cheat day. I moved past my weight loss plateau and am reinvigorated on my body plan. And that's what this book does well, provide motivation. It's the same reason people go to personal trainers--most don't need one once a week or more, but the trainer motivates the person into exercising. This book motivates you to change you eating habits, exercise habits, etc, without telling you this is the one way to do it. He offers several choices and examples of alternates. And he does it all in a clearly inspirational, light-hearted, amusing way. The book is very easy to read. I read the chapters in various order several times over a couple days. Then I shared it with everyone I know. At least 5 of them have purchased the book and we are incorporating different ideas into our lives in different ways.<br /><br />Whether you are trying to lose weight or gain muscle, or both like me, this book will help in one way or the other. I don't recommend you take it as gospel. You need to use your editing skills and find the parts that work for you. And remember to enjoy your life!you are trying to lose weight or gain muscle, or both like me, this book will help in one way or the other. I don't recommend you take it as gospel.

B000JML7EC|5.0|I got a Kindle for Christmas and decided to read the \\"free\\" classics that I haven't read in a very long time.  Based on the reviews of this book, I read it first.  What a great story...it was hard to put down.  I Love the dictionary reference feature on the Kindle, it was so handy to use when reading this book.
1594202842|5.0|I read this book in one sitting and immediately called all my friends to tell them to read it, too.  It has made us think and laugh.  We  all love our children.  We all have proud and not so proud parenting moments in our best efforts to parent well.   I want to thank Amy Chua for writing her memoir and inspiring us to share our stories and hopes and dreams for our children.  This book has inspired  interesting and heated discussions.  Read the whole book, not just the articles about it, and I am sure your friends, book groups and parent groups will have much to talk about.  It won' t be boring, and you will probably laugh at some of your own attempts to do your best.  Thanks to Professor Chua for the opening!
B0034G4P7Q|3.0|This is a movie I wish I would have seen in the theater. No, the big screen isn't mandatory for a movie like this but with all of the hype surrounding it for so long, I watched the film with extremely high expectations just to find myself checking the clock throughout the movie.<br /><br />The Social Network was well written backed up by solid performances but I could have easily shaved 30 minutes off the movie and came out with the same understanding. There was way too much useless dialect and the story seemed to go in circles without much of a dramatic impact to grab the attention of the audience.<br /><br />David Fincher has always been a great director but aside from the dark lighting, it was hardly Fight Club.<br /><br />The music was great and though I'm a Reznor fan, I was skeptical about whether the music would fit the film. Surprisingly the haunting, and very Reznor-esque, music complimented the movie really well.<br /><br />This was a good movie but it wasn't the great, best movie of 2010, Oscar worthy film I expected. I was glad I watched it but I think I was happy with the rental for one-time viewing.<br /><br />Definitely see this if you can but once may be enough for you. You don't have to be a big fan of Facebook to get involved with the drama but I have a feeling 5 years down the road, this movie will hardly be remembered.

Though I was not interested in Blue Ray but loved a DVD and I can't wait to show just two songs from this priceless movie (Do Re and These are the few of my favorite things) to my grand daughter when she visits from UK.  The quality is very good.

1576754227|3.0|The tips that Mr. Tracy has assembled in this book are all useful on their own. They all involve planning, prioritizing, and moving directly toward concrete goals. I've already implemented some of these practices in my daily life (namely, for writing my ongoing novel), and I've seen improvement.    That said, the pieces of advice don't come together into a coherent whole. It's as if each chapter was written in a vacuum, and Mr. Tracy never seems to make a unified point. What's more, the spirit of some of the lessons conflicts with others. For example, he advises to stop and smell the roses but constantly states that one should not waste time on chitchat and socializing. As another example, he says that one should start on a project and not stop on it, yet he has a selection of chapters which propose that one should break things up into small pieces and do it a little bit a time, using a sort of \\"start and stop\\" methodology. The two mindsets are incompatible in absolute terms, and no other terms are put forth. It all feels rather unprofessional and myopic, resulting in the reader having to choose between points in the same book.    Altogether, this book has useful advice, but no one should expect it to amount to some cohesive, focused statement on time management.
B0041T52S6|5.0|As if the 8-bit version of the Universal opening theme song wasn't awesome enough to make you love this movie, the rest of the movie just kicks ass. Suffice to say that although I've never seen any other movies by Edgar Wright (I know, it's a crime that I have yet to watch \\"Hot Fuzz\\" or \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" and I suppose I could watch either movie when it shows up on TV, but I hate commercials. So, Netflix queue, here they come!), after watching \\"Scott Pilgrim vs. the World\\" for, like, ten times, I can say, by the authority vested in me as someone who loves kick-ass movies, that Edgar Wright is officially the most awesome director...at least of the past six months.    Because I love this movie so much, I'm not sure I can communicate anything coherently. So, in lieu of a brilliant, lucid, succinct review, and as a homage to Nick Hornby's novel \\"High Fidelity\\", I offer the following list: Ten Awesome Things about \\"Scott Pilgrim vs. the World\\"  1. The soundtrack. The Pixies, low-fi bass rifts, Beck-inspired singles, and Beachwood Sparks and their cover of Sade's \\"By Your Side\\" are just some of the reasons that this soundtrack rocks every second of the movie.  2. The Smashing Pumpkin t-shirts. Any movie that make any reference to the Smashing Pumpkins is cool in my book. (Sadly, though, not a single SP song is used in the film.)  3. It takes place in Canada. Canada's cool.  4. It is framed as a classic video game of the classic Nintendo variety. (Who doesn't remember playing Super Mario for all those coins?)  5. The trivia about Pac Man is erudite yet funny.  6. The soundtrack (Okay, it's so awesome it deserves two slots on this Top Ten list.)  7. The script. It's clever, witty, snappy, hella funny, and so true to-yet removed from real life with some of the greatest, most awesome-est lines ever. Here's a taste and by no means is this an exhaustive list:  * \\"Listen, I was thinking, we should break up...or whatever.\\"  * \\"We gotta get some buzz goin'. We need ground swell.We need stalkers.\\"  * \\"What? I'm not afraid to hit a girl. I'm a rock star.\\"  * \\"You punched the highlights out of her hair!\\"  * \\"I was just a little bi-curious./Well, honey, I'm a little bi-furious!\\"  * \\"I'm in Lesbians with you.\\"  * \\"Well if my cathedral of cutting edge taste holds no interest for your tragically Canadian sensibilities, then I shall be forced to grant you a swift exit from the premises...and a fast entrance into hell!\\"  *  \\"Dying's gotta suck./You know what's sucks? Getting killed by that guy.\\"  * \\"Young Neil, you have learned well. From this point forward, you will be known as: Neil.\\")  8. The movie is faithful to the story's graphic novel origins. In fact, the complete 7-volume set is sitting in my Amazon.com wish list. (Hint, hint, nudge, nudge anyone for my birthday or just because!)  9. Bleeping out the profanity. It helped me allow my kids to watch it and love it with me. (Not that that's ever stopped me before given that I agree with John Milton's argument in \\"Areopagitica\\" that cloistered virtue is no virtue at all.)  10. Bass Battle. `Nuff said.    This movie is so awesome that a Top Ten list cannot do it justice. So, here are Ten More Awesome Things about \\"Scott Pilgrim vs. the World\\" that didn't quite make the list:  1. The character, Comeau, played by Nelson Franklin: a douche bag who knows everyone but knows nothing. (Greatest line, when listening to a live performance of a band, \\"You should see them live, they're much better live.\\")  2. Did I mention that the soundtrack rocks?  3. My wife and kids love it as much as I do. (Well, maybe not as much as I do.)  4. One of the shortest songs ever performed in a movie: \\"We hate you; please die.\\"  5. The pee-meter.  6. One of the coolest band names ever with the coolest intros. ( \\"We are Sex Bob-omb and we're here to make you think about death and get sad and stuff.\\")  7. Chris Evans (you know, The Human Torch from \\"Fantastic Four\\" and the next Captain America) as Lucas Lee, a caricature ofthe action hero with the commiserate caricature lines like \\"Kiss me, I'm dying,\\" or \\"The only thing keeping me and her apart are the two minutes it's gonna take for me to kick your ass.\\"  8. Michael Cera doing choreographed martial arts proves that lanky geeks can fight!  9. Bill Hader's over-the-top narration.  10. Vegan Police. (You'll have to watch the movie to see what that's all about.)    For these reasons, and so much more, I give \\"Scott Pilgrim vs. The World\\" 10 out of 5 bass guitars.

B004FV1ESW|5.0|If the previous reviewer 'Dave' was familiar with plot structure, he would realize that the similarity to Heat is mostly aesthetic, and any similarities to The Departed are uh... there are none. Other than the fact that it's about Irish criminals in Boston. Kind of like the way Valkyrie and Inglourious Basterds are 'basically the same movie' because they're both about a plot to kill Hitler...    The Town is a thrilling and dramatic crime picture, with great acting, directed by a steller artist. The critical praise is well deserved. It's a character focused piece, with some stunning action set pieces, and great realistic Boston-Irish atmosphere. There is one scene in this that got me so tense in the theatre that... well that actually happened, that never happens to me! Affleck knows how to build tension, is what I'm saying.    Shades of 'Heat' are surreal, but practically subconscious, they are entirely different movies. If you can get over VERY superficial similarities (bank robberies, some of the costumes, the realism) and look at the finer points that make Ben Affleck's film unique you will not ruin your experience with this one.    Next time I would suggest that Dave actually watch the three movies he is comparing before comparing them.    I don't want to give away the plot, and there will be plenty of synopsis in the future I'm sure. If the worst you can say is 'It reminds me of other crime epics, and most people say it's good.' To me that basically sounds like a recommendation, no? Look into it if you're a fan of the genre.
0451228375|2.0|I read the whole thing, but with gritted teeth. I enjoyed Pillars of the Earth (while not a masterpiece, it was entertaining) so was hoping this would be equal to it in quality. Unfortunately, it dragged excessively and the characters were all one-dimensional.
0374290024|4.0|A book very well worth reading. Morris is an excellent historian and a great story teller. He weaves the exploding body of empirical evidence about human history into an easily followed story line culminating in the emergence of the contemporary \\"world order.\\" However, as a theorist of history he has a long way to go.    Morris attempts to begin this intellectual journey with the origins of humans ca. 2 million years ago. But evolutionary biology and paleoanthropology are not his forte and this early part of the book is a little shallow and unsatisfying. However, as he reaches the eras where his specialties, archaeology and history, get traction, the story gains powerful substance and narrative force.     This strong tour of the archaeology of the first Eurasian states, the ensuing development of the great later states (like the Roman and Han Empires) and the formation of the enormous contemporary states (England, China, Japan, Russia, India, the US, France, Germany, etc) occupies the majority of 622 pages. Morris' exploration of this rich landscape gives even the expert reader new opportunity to assimilate this truly massive and illuminating body of evidence. Some details of the Western component will be familiar, but the Eastern elements (especially Chinese archaeology) are sufficiently new that there is a great deal to be learned from Morris' quick witted story telling. All this empirical insight more than justifies the time to read this long book.    However, Morris' particular concern is to construct a theory of history that will explain why the West (Western Europe and its derivatives, like North America) has become so economically dominant - and the related question of whether the East (especially fast-growing China) will catch up, or even take over global economic primacy.    In attempting this larger theoretical task Morris has produced yet another 20th Century history but we need is a 21st Century version, a fundamentally new kind of effort. Specifically,the author pursues the earlier professional historian's tradition of telling a superficially, intuitively plausible story - and then calling this story a science of history. It is no such thing.  Rather, the author does brilliant \\"natural history\\" (as it would be called in the physical and biological sciences). Natural history (in this sense) consists of the early and vital endeavor of gathering bodies of empirical insight that can form the basis on which a real science of a subject (history, in this case) can subsequently be built. Our evolved human minds lead us to organize such raw evidence into plausible \\"stories.\\" These stories help us see and remember the data, but they are not explanations of those data. Only science can give us actual explanations.     An analogy helps here. In the 18th Century, Linnaeus organized his enormous systematic analysis of the properties of organisms into an orderly \\"phylogeny.\\" However, all this organized information could be just as readily explained as the product of a divine plan as of purposeless, material processes. Only with the coming of Darwin's' scientific theory of evolution by natural selection did Linnaeus' efforts become science rather than natural history.    More specifically, for claims to be scientific they must be \\"falsifiable.\\" This term of art has a simple and exact meaning. A claim is scientific if and only if it is strongly vulnerable to being shown to be false by a skeptical second party acting in public on the basis of empirical evidence that everyone has access to. History as \\"natural history\\" - still in its scholarly adolescence - has developed the opposite tradition. Professional historians have learned (mostly unconsciously) to tell rich \\"just so\\" stories that are inherently invulnerable to falsification. This imperviousness to test allows historians to build reputations based solely on their empirical work and their esteem within a fraternity/sorority of fellow story tellers. This tiny sisterhood/brotherhood of professional academic story tellers is well served by this practice - the larger global community (urgently in need of a real science of history) is most emphatically not well served.    Let us illustrate this criticism by analyzing one of the many just so stories masquerading as theory in this book. Morris seeks to explain the origins of the first agriculture in Southwest Asia. He suggests that combinations of local climate and unusually high availability of domesticatable species did the trick. In this form, this claim is not falsifiable. After all, we cannot rerun history after having given East Asia more domesticatable plants, for example.     However, we can restate this claim in forms that are falsifiable. For example, all the supposed consequences of agriculture should follow plant domestication, on this theory. This prediction turns out to be wrong. The coming of plant domestication to Southwest Asia apparently follows an earlier social revolution in which relatively large permanent settlements supported by wild food harvesting appear first (the archaeologically recognizable Natufian culture). Plant domestication looks like an effect of a preceding social cause, not a cause in its own right.    Another falsifiable version of this specific just so story states that the availability of domesticated plants should drive the rapid formation of the relatively large permanent villages associated with agriculture - available domesticated plants should behave like a cause. The prehistoric (pre-colonial contact) record from North America falsifies this form of the story/theory. Specifically, the Mesoamerican Triad of domesticates (maize/corn, beans and squash) are imported into North America more than 1000 years before the great agricultural societies of the continent are formed (including the Mississippians and Anasazi). Moreover, these North American agricultural societies arise quite abruptly, even explosively, when they finally do come. These empirical observations, again, falsify Morris' theory that plant domesticates cause agriculture revolutions. Something else, possibly something social, is apparently afoot here.    Having falsified the \\"available domesticates\\" theory of agricultural revolutions, we must go back to the drawing board and try again. We keep constructing new falsifiable theories and destroying them on the evidence until we finally come upon one that we cannot destroy/falsify. This surviving story/theory is the answer we seek. In a mature science we \\"fail our way to success.\\" There is just no other way to move forward.    The natural history of history is now wonderfully mature - and Morris has made his own formidable contributions here. Learning to transform just so stories into falsifiable claims is a professional craft that can be mastered - allowing rich natural history to metamorphose into legitimate science. Members of Morris' generation have a unique opportunity to midwife this transition, creating entirely new professional reputations for themselves. It would be tragic for this author's generation if their students made this revolution instead - while Morris and his contemporaries stayed behind.    On the last page of his book Morris suggests that a real theory of history is vital to a humane, survivable future. We could not agree more. It's time to take the step.    Paul M.

B0034G4P7Q|4.0|This is a rapid-fire true story of the tumultuous start of Facebook and its founder, who was sued successfully for not sharing the credit and for possibly stealing ideas from other Harvard students.  It is much more interesting than it may sound, with great direction and casting.    The soundtrack is great but it sometimes overwhelms the conversation, especially when Eisenberg and Timberlake are in the nightclub.
B0041KKYEM|5.0|\\"Black Swan\\" is the ballet as horror story. Early on in the film we're told the plot of \\"Swan Lake.\\" It's a story of a princess who is transformed into a swan. And only the love of a prince can break the spell, but she's betrayed by her evil twin and kills herself by throwing herself off a cliff, after losing her love, and herself. \\"Black Swan\\" parallels that story.<br /><br />Nina (Natalie Portman) is a dancer in the New York Ballet who is on the edge of getting the role that she's worked all her life to get, that of the Swan Queen in \\"Swan Lake.\\" Battling an overprotective mother, Erica (Barbara Hershey) who has pushed her daughter towards perfection, Nina runs into a potential rival and friend in Lily (Mila Kunis). In Nina's efforts to be perfect in the dance she has driven herself to the edge of sanity and she starts having episodes that seem real but aren't. It's difficult to tell the difference as Nina moves seamlessly between reality and dream states. This isn't about Nina's descent into madness. When the movie starts she's already on the edge and looking over the cliff.<br /><br />\\"Black Swan\\" is definitely the apex of Portman's acting career (so far). She uses her face to full advantage. Having rigorously worked out to look the part of the ballerina, Portman is lean and muscular and the fine, delicate bone structure of her face is accentuated. She gracefully moves her head like a swan which adds to the building of the character. Portman goes through a range of emotions, from delicately vulnerable to madness and they're reflected in her face. I think she actually uses a minimum of words, but still brings Nina fully to life. Barbara Hershey as Nina's mother has echoes from \\"Carrie\\" in her performance, and in director Darren Aronofsky's choice of shots in their apartment.<br /><br />As Nina begins to come unhinged she has a hard time discerning reality from the unreal, and so does the viewer. I don't remember the last time a movie had me so fooled as to what was `real' and what wasn't. A lot of the credit for that needs to go to director Darren Aronofsky. He has many nuanced and subtle touches that are clues as to what's going on that another director might want to call attention to, but Aronofsky has confidence in what he's doing and in the audience's ability to pick up on them. Aronofsky has made a \\"Sunset Boulevard\\" for the ballet with the madness full on. And you thought the ballet was for sissies.<br /><br />At the end of \\"Black Swan\\" I wanted to cheer for the movie. If you see a lot of movies you know when you've seen a good one. I think I've seen an Oscar worthy movie in Portman's performance and the movie itself.t. A lot of the credit for that needs to go to director Darren Aronofsky.

1595825045|5.0|First off, This is literally the BEST art book that I've ever bought (I have purchased at least 50), and I'm not just saying that because I'm big fan of the show. This is the entire animated series in paper form from start to finish, from per-production to the final episode and beyond. It doesnt just give you a buch of pictures to look at a drool over. It also gives you complete insight into their creative process through the text beside the draw dropping art. You are bound to end up learning a lot about the show that you never knew. Its neatly bound in a durable hardcover so no worries of page bending and curling. Not to mention its fairly cheap for a book with this many full color pages. The book is very THICK for an art book and a must have for any Avatar the Last Airbender fan, aspiring artist/animators such as myself or anyone else who likes to look at concept art.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|Documentary look at health care in the United States as provided by profit-oriented health maintenance organizations (HMOs) compared to free, universal care in Canada, the U.K., and France. Moore contrasts U.S. media reports on Canadian care with the experiences of Canadians in hospitals and clinics there. He interviews patients and doctors in the U.K. about cost, quality, and salaries. He examines why Nixon promoted HMOs in 1971, and why the Clintons' reform effort failed in the 1990s. He talks to U.S. ex-pats in Paris about French services, and he takes three 9/11 clean-up volunteers, who developed respiratory problems, to Cuba for care.<br /><br />Superb Video.  Excellent twist.<br />Mr. Moore talks to people who have been ensnared, sometimes fatally, in a for-profit bureaucracy.<br />And he asks the hard questions to let the audience think about other vision for Health Care System.
1400049628|5.0|I purchased this book for my 7th grade nephew who is interested in all things having to do with Zombies. He was reading it on a family vacation and he LOVED it so much he read it cover to cover in 2 days. The funny thing was that, probably because of his age, he completely didn't get the fact that the book was a parody on zombies. He took all of it very seriously and he would come in and fill us all on little known zombie facts. I thought I was going to die laughing.    My 30-something brother picked it up and just had a great time with it. He said it was a fun and interesting read. We capped off the trip with a Zombie movie marathon that the boys analyzed for us with their new knowledge of Zombies.      Bottom line: both loved it and gave it 5 stars.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Powerful documentary that tells the cause-and-effect of green house gases and fossil fuel dependence in the world.    Most disturbing fact, and images that can lead the audience to think about what's untold future we will face.    Good for audience for care about future generations.  Must watch if you work in energy sector, and want to make money in this new decade in search for energy solution.
B00428CPUY|5.0|What could be better than Eric Clapton performing live? Its a Crossroads concert. It just shows the respect that all these great artists have for Eric and Guitar playing. What a wonderfully diverse range of musicians who have made guitar playing an art. Not a bad track on this program. Recommend to any Clapton fan or just anyone who likes guitar music played very well.
B0030Y11XS|5.0|Consider that the hundreds of fans, celebrities and journalists, who crowded the newly renovated Lincoln Center last night to watch Moore's take down of Wall Street and corporate America, were enjoying the sleek, new theater thanks in large part to the very institutions that Moore lambasts as greedy, sleazy and beyond repent.<br /><br />Before the film, the crowd sipped champagne and cocktails in the \\"Morgan Stanley Lobby\\" and then headed to their seats in the \\"Citi Balcony.\\" Movie tickets were available at the \\"Bank of New York Box Office\\" and there's outdoor seating at the \\"Credit Suisse<br /><br />Moore's overall conclusion: \\"Capitalism is an evil and you can't regulate evil. You have to replace it with something that is good for everyone.\\" And he suggests replacing the current system, not with socialism, but with a true democracy in which the masses vote out government officials who are in the pocket of the powerful and wealthy elite. Moore suggests that the big turnout in the 2008 election indicates that \\"one man, one vote\\" still means something.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Star Wars in Blue ray will make it possible for my new TV to convert the movies to 3D. One of my favorite all time classics. I can't wait to see all of the action in 3D.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book, great series. I found myself feeling a little down when I finished the third and final book. I wish the author had continued the series for another one or two books.
B0021L8V0M|3.0|Go for the \\"theatrical cut\\" instead.  While I loved this film in the theater, this \\"extended\\" version proves the old adage that more is not necessarily better.  There's too much explanation, particularly towards the end.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This was an eye opening  moment it  really made you think about the food chain and where  and how we get out food. After watching this I have made changes  how I purchase food . Every now and then I may back slide but for the most part  I am glad I purchased this. I look for where my food is coming from and I have noticed a  change in my  health. I think this was very well put together
B0021L8V0M|1.0|Ok, I don't write reviews very often but want to save people the money from renting or buying this awful film. Rented it last night on Amazon Video-On-Demand and turned it off after about 40 minutes. This film, too me, is a complete rip-off of the Bourne series, only the Bourne series are some of the best action films ever made. Not going to ruin the plot here for people who will still rent or buy this, but the actual idea is pretty cool. And of course, Angelina looks amazing and kicks *** of course. It is just the execution of the plot and writing that is horrible. Directing isn't so hot either. Boring, linear and just a tad too unrealistic (even for this genre). If you must watch this film, at least rent it or Netflix it so you don't waste too much money. If you are the few people in the world who hasn't seen the Bourne series and you are looking for action, I'd rent them instead.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|A student in my school (I'm a high school Librarian) was looking for this title and after deciding that we needed it in our collection, I ordered it.  Because I'm a Prime member, it arrived in plenty of time for the student to get his project done, the price was great and everyone is pleased.
030745455X|4.0|I had seen the TV series produced by Swedish television before reading the english version of the books. In some ways the TV series is better. Having said this I enjoyed reading the books even though I knew what was coming. Lisabeth must surely become a cult hero - she is with me. Highly recommended!
B003YUC2FE|5.0|Toy Story Trilogy was a great value and a great price! The packaging was colorful and creative! This set included DVD, Blu-ray and Digital copies...crazy value and great collection. Nice to have the whole story all together and adaptable to any media!
B0047WJ12K|3.0|I knew I was avoiding this for a reason, and am glad I only rented it. I was drawn in for the first hour intriged by the ideas presented, but found some of the solutions so badly flawed even a no nothing like me was catching them. The last hour of the movie was just another long, drawn out chase/shoot-em-up. Anyone besides me ready for more creative solutions than another shot to the head?    Special effects seamless, acting great, cinematography beautiful - only gave it a three.
B004CLYKLI|5.0|I can't believe that people are reviewing this book based on their reading the newspaper article rather than reading the actual book. If you read the book, you will see right from the first page that the author is showing the flaws of the Asian stereotypes we all aware of.  The pages are laced with humor throughout as we watch this woman learn and grow from her own misconceptions of child-rearing. And, honestly, who are we to point fingers. There is the common saying: \\"There is no manual for parenting.\\" Who are we to point fingers and accuse. We all have our own flaws which I pray we all honestly admit to and try to grow from.  Try writing a book about yours and let us all critique you.    Most importantly, this is not a parenting guide. It is a mother's memoir.  Read it as such.
B003UESJHO|4.0|Enjoyable because it's NOT just Rocky XV. Its more than a David vs Goliath story. The story-line of the family stress outside the ring carries the movie.
0307454541|3.0|The most tragic aspect of Stieg Larsson's early death is that his books never got a chance to achieve that final polish. Here are a pair of great characters: Mikael Blomkvist, an investigative reporter disgraced by a libel conviction, and the title character, Lisbeth Salander, an autistic computer hacker with authority issues who operates on the very edge of society.<br /><br />The author sets out a juicy puzzle: what happened to the missing heir of the Vanger family? How did the teenage Harriet Vanger vanish from an island on the same day that an accident closed the bridge to the mainland?<br /><br />Her body was never found.<br /><br />It's a great premise with wonderful characters, but the story unfolds in a rambling way and there are absolute issues with the writing and holes in the development, especially as book draws to a close. I can totally understand the enthusiasm which this book excites; I enjoyed reading it, but it was like reading the rough draft of a potentially great novel which misses greatness because of inconsistencies and details that don't ring true.<br /><br />I liked the characters enough that I will certainly read the other books in the series if they come my way; but these books probably would have been better if the author had lived to edit them into tighter form. I'd like to rate this higher: shall I say 3 and a half stars?
B003JSSPSY|5.0|rec'd as listed, comes with nice cover also - UPS guy left delivery on front porch, and the cover got wet - this was a Christmas gift so this was especially disappointing - I tried to dry it out under heavy objects so it would dry evenly and mostly successful - this was not Amazon's fault
B003ZVJFFM|4.0|I had not seen this movie until I rented it. It was great! If you liked the Polar Express, this is made much like it. It is now one of my favorite Christmas movies.
B000TEUSJK|5.0|the only big budget porn flick in history.  what sets this apart from all other porn flicks is the cast, the  acting, the story and the big time production costs.
B002VECM6S|3.0|So I totally love this movie, but when I ordered it there was no movie just an empty case. I called them and they sent a new one right away for free.
B002ZCY7SW|5.0|Loved the whole series.  Really going to miss 24.  I believe it was the best show to come to TV.  Always had me at the edge of my seat.  Glad I always watched it by the season.  I don't think I could of handled having to wait a whole week to see what happens next.  There wasn't a season that ever disappointed us.
B0001ARCFA|5.0|It took me a few weeks to really learn to appreciate these headphones, but now that I can hear the difference between this set of headphones and my old set (a pair of fairly inexpensive Yamaha headphones), the difference is immense.  The detail that they bring out in all types of music breathes new life into even the oldest tune.  These headphones make me wish my car stereo had a headphone jack so that I could listen to all my music through these instead of speakers.<br /><br />I listen to a wide array of genres, as well as record and mix my own music, and I use these for everything.  While they say you shouldn't mix on headphones, I find that these headphones are fairly balanced with only a slight emphasis on middle range frequencies, which gives the music you're listening to more warmth.<br /><br />I shopped around for headphones for a while and finally decided to purchase these because they were reasonably priced compared to much higher end studio headphones and have been happy with my purchase ever since.  (And by the way, given that the headphone's impedance is 55 ohms, you do NOT need a separate amplifier to crank them up.)<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend these headphones.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Purchased as a Christmas present, brand new & worked perfectly. Pink Floyd fans will LOVE this DVD! Great images and recording for non-HD and overall the purchase was definitely worth the money!
B0043ISH6O|4.0|During the interview as part of the bonus materials on the Blu-ray, David Fincher said Trent's main theme reminded him of Ligeti. To me, the simple piano theme is heavily influenced by Arvo Part, epecially his \\"Spiegel im Spiegel.\\" That's a compiment. Also, I prefered Trent's orignial Wendy Carlos-inspired take on Grieg's \\"Hall of the Mountain King.\\" It made the point that with all this rowing and ceremonial crap for rich people going on, back at Harvard, the computers and young people were changing the world.
B001GCUO5W|1.0|It just didn't live up to the book. Which was amazing by the way, and should be read before or instead of watching this movie. I didn't like the filming technique which came off too \\"Hitchcockian\\" and cartoonish. Plus it was horribly over acted (even after Dicaprio's awful Boston accent ). It would have been better as a suspense/mystery film instead of trying to sell it off as a \\"horror\\" flick. At least one Dennis Lehane book turned out good as a movie... Gone baby gone!
B001974DG0|5.0|One of his classics.  This book traveled all over the country to my family.  They grow up so fast, don't they?
B0038M2AZA|5.0|This is a very good movie - gives a great perspective and understanding autism.  Temple has made a difference in her life - in ways impossible for people without autism.  She and all children / people with autism are very valuable just like anybody else.  Once I saw it, I had to watch it again!  Presented very well and lots of funny moments too.
0316666343|4.0|I have read this book before. That is why I wanted it. It is a great story and that is why I gave it four stars but I was a bit surprised with the way the book looked. It was a plain blue cover I felt a bit of bait and switch by the picture advertising it. I think it was in a library prior to my purchasing it. It seemed a bit used and I thought it was supposed to be new. It did arrive on time thou and is a great story.
B001IBIHQ4|1.0|Not as well done as Band of Brothers and this of course is a disservice to the warriors who fought in the Pacific.  The story presented from the point of view of three different marine infantrymen in three different units presents a disjointed view of the war in the Pacific.  Not recommended.
B000JQU1VS|4.0|Overall, a very good collection of the Holmes stories. The Kindle version, however, has difficulty with diacritic marks and symbols such as the pound and shilling. One sees nonsensical symbols instead which are quite distracting.
B00000HYSN|5.0|This album normally gets lumped into the genre of \\"folk\\" or the even more broad \\"indie rock,\\" but a more fitting classification would be \\"collection of songs that haunt you more and more with each listen.\\" The intimacy of this album is its most appealing feature, as listening to it through headphones gives you the feeling that you are actually in the room as Oldham and the guys are recording. The songs, specifically the title track and the closer, \\"Raining in Darling\\" are exceptional stand alone songs, but also work great within the context of the album. It seems to drag a bit during the second half, but sometimes this is advantageous, as it is difficult to listen to the album all the way through in one sitting.
0763650420|4.0|My 18 month old son and I read this book every day. My pediatrician recommended this book to me when my son's father and I split up. It reminds the reader that although Mommy leaves for a little bit, she ALWAYS returns!! My son loves it!! It is a little drawn out in the middle, but overall I would highly recommend this book for any family where Mom might work a lot or has to take small short trips or separated parents!!
B000001DV2|5.0|Def Leppard is the best classic rock band ever. Anyone that says that Def Leppard should no longer be together does not know good music when they hear it. They have many die hard fans that have loved them for years & always will. Hysteria is still there number one album to me but this is also a great album.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|Room is written first of all from a 5 year old's perspective, and while some found this irritating and some found it to be a ploy to gain more interest, I found it interesting and similar to my experience while reading The Help.  There is a small adjustment period while you learn the little boys speech patterns and nuances, but it is worth it.<br /><br />I don't want to spoil the contents of the story, so I will say if you enjoy a story that will make you think \\"What would I do\\" then this is for you.  It is heartfelt, a little disturbing,and something that you may have never considered.<br /><br />All in all I found this book is one I most definitely will make Room for on my permanent bookshelf.  An honor few books receive.<br /><br />On another note, I did purchase it for Kindle, and it is a bit high on the price scale? so what's up with that?
B001IBIHQ4|3.0|Nothing worse than trying to fit love stories in war film. There are much better ways to fill in between combat scenes than flowers and fornicating. This chopped up, disoriented film missed an excellent chance to portray the Pacific war as BoB portrayed the ETO.    The combat scenes however where excellently done and very realistic, minus the computer generated aircraft flying over. They looked like cartoon airplanes. I'm sure they could have rounded up enough Hellcats and Corsairs to make an attempt at reality in the air.    All in all it is worth watching but fails miserably in portraying the Pacific war as BoB did the European war. I think most of the cast would have been better suited in a film about the Vietnam War.    Rick
B000UW8596|4.0|It's a movie based on the work of Marquis de Sade so it's not a Disney movie. It's full of horrific sexual violence and scenes that will absolutely turn your stomach. The only way to demonize fascism is to show it in it's full glory. This is what the movie does. Prepare yourself.
B003Q6D25K|5.0|Well, honestly, I thought the first movie sucked. I went with a couple friends and we laughed our butts off the entire time. Then the 2nd one came out, I was asked to go see it with someone and at first I was like, no, no it's gonna suck, I don't wanna go see it, buuuut eventually I did and I'm glad I did because the 1st paranormal and the 2nd are two completely different movies aside from what the basis is. This one is more suspenseful and MUCH scarier. If you've seen the first movie, but not this one, you're not gonna expect how well this movie was put together. Sure, at some scenes it's really boring and you're sitting there thinking JUST GET TO THE POINT haha. Well, I would say even if you didn't enjoy the first one, like myself, watch this one, it's much better.
B00006674X|5.0|Excellent service and excellent quality--a win/win situation.  I forgot how entertaining and corny those old Elvis movies were.  I was expecting an old washed up copy, but the dvd brings color to a new light.  The acting did not change, however. :) Thanks for restoring memories!
B0041KKYBA|5.0|Viewed from Europe:  I just arrived from a movie theater, where I saw this feature, with either specialists and non-specialists in the economic science (???!!! - I invoque a like-type Miranda rights..., or, if you will, NOT COMMENT, for not say more...) and I'm mind-blogged about this documentary and the blindness created by schools, ergo, scholl of economics, who spread and cultivate the mantras..., the governments and the (de)regulators of the USA and the EU , ..., and, last but not the least, our corporate media, EVERYWHERE, 24/24 - 7 DW, EVERYWHERE,  over the great majority of the american and european people, about this status quo and the crooks who are running it.

0812550706|5.0|Im not normally into books set in the future, or an alternate history/universe. But OSC has written a book here that simply is a must read for so many different reasons. But in the end all I can say to those considering picking up this book is do so! It was and still is the greatest novel I have ever read.
0060872675|4.0|This is an illustrated discworld book and it's very cute/humorous.  I read it when I first received it, but I hadn't read any of the other watch novels -- I will say that I reread it again after completing the watch novels and it now falls into place with the proper background.  I wanted the book to go along with my other discworld books, but I'm not sure it was worth the money I paid for it....again, it's cute, but I'm not sure this is really a kids book either (as one of the tags is 'childrens books').
B003YFIUW8|5.0|This is the first book I've read by this author & I was not disappointed. The writing is intriguing & I, like others, was unable to stop reading until the end. I was very happy it was a holiday that I began reading this, because I just couldn't put it down. Very interesting being told through the eyes of a a child. Haunting because of the realities of the story. I have recommended this book to family & friends & recommend it anyone.
B003XSSR4W|5.0|The sound on these Apple remasters is great! my favorites on this release are: take it all, baby blue,flying, i'd die babe (my favorite on the album, very beatle-esque, in a rubber soul sort of way), name of the game, suitcase (my 2nd favorite on the record, wouldn't have sounded too out of place on the magic christian album),sweet tuesday morning(sounds like it could be on a fleetwood mac album and sung by stevie nicks~seriosly,close your eyes and listen to it...), day after day, perfection (tied for first place as my favorite tune on the album, great hooks and lyrics). the bonus songs are pretty good also. this cd has been growing on me since i got it. maybe on the first listen, you will think it's so-so, but those tasty beatlesque power pop hooks do grow on you.
1600242405|5.0|Keith Richards seems incapable of lying. He's definitely not trying to put a halo over his head as he tells with complete honesty the sometimes ridiculous, and other times admirable, story of his life to this point. One minute he's giving a detailed and loving account of the Open G tuning and how it opened a whole new world for him musically, the next he's giving some great advice on the use of the knife and how to deal with physical altercations. (\\"When you see trouble comeing, don't wait...\\" 'When he sees the glint of your knife kick his balls to kingdome come.'). You will also read of his escapades with drugs and his love affair with heroin. And this same man is the one compassionate enough to make sure a blind girl who regularly went to Rolling Stones concerts was watched after and was given a ride home after each show. These and other seeming incongruities make for a very intriguing person and a great read. Also, the recorded version with Johnny Depp reading is almost like having Keith Richards telling you his story in person.
0698400852|5.0|Although I have seen several movie versions of, \\"A Christmas Carol\\", I have never read the book, until I ordered this one December 2010.  This version is, I think, a great representation of what this book should be.  The illustrations by Robert Ingpen are outstanding and plentiful.  If my children were still young, I would be reading this book to them each Christmas season.  As it is, I will be ordering them this book next Christmas to read to thier children during Christmas seasons to come.
B00428CPUY|4.0|I really think Eric Clapton knows what we like. great preformers and hard driving music. This DVD wasn't the heart stopper that the 2007 DVD was, but it is close. I like it, I like it alot.
B000B589JI|4.0|I know some people have complained about this product, but i have no complaints about it. I was out of town, at a Boffer LARP when i ran out of fuel for my Zippo. This thing came to the rescue. I was in costume and didn't want to have to change clothes and go to a store. I got all fueled up and didn't miss out on anything. I wouldn't put 2 flints in the holder as you might not get one of them back out. I always keep my extra flints in the bottom of my Zippo anyway.    I can say that the canister does in deed hold enough fuel for one fill, and does not leak any at all. I recommend this product to any Zippo user out there. We have all run out of fuel at the worst time possible. Now i don't worry about running out anymore.
B00003CXBK|5.0|I have loved this movie since I was a kid and still enjoy it today, I've lost count of how many times I've seen it. The voice acting, animation, story, and messages throughout this film are simply the best. Miyazaki is an amazing man and I am honored to own several of his films. The DVD is great, I don't remember how the VHS was when my family had rented it.
B002ZG99CC|5.0|The Karate Kid, was about a young boy determined to erase fear in his life by overcoming a group of bullies.  I enjoyed the movie because not only did he earn respect in the end, but the bullies also learned a valuable lesson as well.  It was based on Kung Fu, not karate, but the overall content was good.  I would definitely recommend this movie to others.
1439152780|2.0|I really enjoyed \\"The Forgotten Garden\\" so I was looking forward to this book.  There was so much potential for great characters but the characters spent too much time on daily tasks that anyone can experience.  All through the book the author hints at the terrible things that happened during WWII.  She tries to share insight into her characters past but it is boring with no depth.  You just get glimpses of some pretty amazing things that the characters experienced.  It leaves you wishing you could find out more about them. The ending was an attempt to give you more but I was left feeling disconnected.  I love it when the characters of a excellent book seem like real, breathing people with feelings and depth.      I wish I could give this book more stars but it was a great disappoint for me. I give it 2 stars for effort and the potential of great characters that was not fulfilled.

B003U0AHBO|4.0|The oft-told tale of Robin Hood is brought to the big screen again, this time by Ridley Scott, director of \\"Gladiator.\\" It is not surprising that Russell Crowe, star of the director's 2001 Oscar-winning film, plays the heroic \\"outlaw\\" of the new British/American adventure film. The 2010 \\"Robin Hood\\" is an action adventure film, but the action sequences, thrilling as they are, are not many in number in this 148-minute film, and those who are looking for a romance would be disappointed.    Set in 1199, \\"Robin Hood\\" follows the story of Robin Longstride, a skilled archer and swordsman. Robin Longstride, tired of the long war, flees the Crusading army with Alan A'Dale (Alan Doyle), Will Scarlett (Scott Grimes) and Little John (Kevin Durand) to secretly return to their homeland. On their way, Robin meets Robert Loxley (Douglas Hodge), who was just attacked by plotting Godfrey (Mark Strong), and Robin promises the dying knight to return the sword to his father and its original owner Sir Walter Loxley (Max von Sydow).    Ridley Scott's new tale on the famous legend starts with an intriguing premise, but loses its grip on narrative in the following mid-section. The storyline is too convoluted in the second half of the film, with a back story about Robin's childhood. The relationship between Robin and Marian (Cate Blanchett) is not interesting because of the lack of chemistry, and the low-key performances from the players. Action scenes are very good, but sometimes too many characters clutter the screen. The cast is great including Eileen Atkins, William Hurt and Mark Strong, but their characters tend to be rather flat.     All in all I enjoyed \\"Robin Hood\\" and his adventures though I think a simpler plotline would have allowed the film to showcase its strength more effectively. I also hope some loose ends (who are those children anyway?) will be tied up in the sequel if there will be one.
0061537969|4.0|This book really makes you think.  I'm not really into dogs, don't dislike them but am not crazy about them either.  Have never owned one.  But this book is so touching and really puts you inside the head of a dog.  I don't think dogs process sensory information the way humans do and reason and conceptualize the way humans do.  So that aspect of the book is probably unrealistic.  But I've also heard of dog-owners that swear that their dogs fully understand what's going on with human-like clarity.    The book is also about a race car driver which is interesting.  I never knew anything about race car driving and didn't realize the importance of technique in this sport.  The name of the book comes from Seattle which is where most of the story takes place.  There's a lot of rain in Seattle and so the dog's owner, the race car driver, has a lot of experience and confidence racing his car in the rain.    I would have liked to understand the wife better.  It was hard for me to understand why she handled things the way she did.  Perhaps the author was trying to keep the focus on Enzo the dog and how a dog would think.  I.e. everything just is and he wouldn't have had a reason to understand why or how the wife made the decisions the way she did.      At the end of the book I was boo-hoo'ing big time.  It was so incredibly touching.  I enjoyed this unique book.
0316069884|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone considering crossing over into vegetarianism. While this book is not a how-to, so to speak, it will no doubt encourage your journey to a more compassionate and healthy way of life.<br />  I found Mr. Jonathan's work very thorough and walked away a better informed and determined vegetarian because of it. Loved it!

The language is lush and evocative.<br /><br />The character of Fermin Romero do Torres (not the main character but a supporting one) is so amazingly memorable.  If this book ever gets made into a movie then, if cast well, this character could go down as one of the greatest film characters ever.<br /><br />Can't recommend highly enough.  Fabulous read!!
0061134007|4.0|Bought the book because we liked other mysteries set in Norway (Larsson's \\"Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\" etc.)and we are interested in WW II stories about the Resistance, Nazi occupation, and espionage.  I was encouraged because the Norwegian author was hyped as one of the most popular modern European mystery writers and I did find the book interesting and the mystery story intertwined with historical events on the Eastern Front pretty compelling.  My friend who shares similar interests, didn't enjoy the book quite as much though~~he found the translation into English a little awkward at times, the ending somewhat weak and the storyline a bit contrived. WW II Resistance on the Eastern Front and its modern day fall-out is seldom covered in popular literature though so I found this book worthwhile and I'll probably buy others by the same author.
B004BG0AEA|5.0|I ordered this for my husband for Christmas.  He told me it was on Amazon for less than $20.00.  I thought I was doing that and when the CD came, it was from a \\"private citizen\\" or whatever and it cost me $34.95.  When he found out what I paid, he said something was wrong because it didn't cost that much.  What happened???
1594202842|5.0|I am about the same age as Ms. Chua, am married to a non-Chinese Westerner and I am a first-born daughter of Chinese immigrants who struggled to make sure that I and my siblings had the best chance for the finest college and graduate school educations that we could muster.  I truly appreciate their efforts to give me the life and comforts that I and my family have now, but it was sometimes hard to understand the stress that they must have felt in trying to convey the need for me to try to do my best so as to not limit my opportunities.  They didn't have any extra time to coddle and cajole...and I think I would have described them as strict, only because they really couldn't handle too much chaos or expense due to error. I rarely did the 'play date' (we just played outside) or the overnight (when I did, it was always regrettable), nor did we have the money for music lessons or after school sports (no nanny or babysitter to drive and pick up with younger siblings in the house).  I never felt 'poor' but I knew better than to waste anything, all of my clothes were hand-me-downs and we only got one toy or specific wish list item for Christmas.     Nevertheless, they fully paid for college, grad school, weddings and even the down payments on the first condo for each of their kids.  Their grandchildren all have college funds set up at birth and receive regular deposits on them.        They have celebrated their 50th anniversary this year (they even married the same year that Chua's parents were engaged) and they proudly enjoy their kids, in-law kids and grandkids who live nearby and see them regularly and love them.  I wish their lives as parents could have been as 'fun' as my life is now...enjoying my daughter's lead in the school musical and my son's basketball and baseball games.  We travel and do many of the things that my parents could not have afforded then.  I am considered a very 'involved parent' and while my kids really could have gotten better grades, our priorities were not as driven/focused as Ms. Chua's.     Interestingly, my 14 year-old son started reading this book the moment I put it on my Kindle and he read 20 chapters today (sometimes reading aloud to me.)  He is enjoying hearing about Ms. Chua's background, her family and her funny stories/struggles, but he also appreciates her effort and sees that I am not the only parent who cares about  details and hard work.  I also think that he now realizes that he is capable of working harder (after all, he knew his alphabet at 18 months, too), even if I don't pressure him (he is not a fighter, so pushing him is not as successful a tactic as others)    I appreciate Ms. Chua's willingness to put herself out there for what is clearly a global love-hate debate.  VERY uncharacteristic of a Chinese girl, I must say.  But if there is one thing that is true, hers is actually a rather \\"American\\" idea:  That you can actually affect your outcome (or at least not limit your options) if you try to apply yourself to the best of your ability.  It greatly contrasts with the British system, for example.  In Great Britain, no matter how smart you are, or how hard you try, you will never be the Queen of England.  So, even if this is described as a 'Chinese' parenting model, what it really is is a how any person might try to maximize all that the West (at least here in the US) has to offer.  Brava!
B001IBIHQ4|1.0|Those of you looking for \\"Band of Brothers\\" Pacific Edition will be disappointed.  This is a much more ambiguous story than Band of Brothers, and why?  And why?  Is it because the Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg who swallowed Tom Brokaw's \\"The Greatest Generation\\" before 9/11, Afghanistan, and Iraq, suddenly remembered that they were bleeding heart liberals, and that the Japanese in World War II were just as wonderful people as US Marines?      It's noteworthy that the American soldiers in Europe didn't hate their German enemies nearly as much as the Marines and soldiers in the Pacific hated theirs, but you'd never know it from this series compared to Band of Brothers.  These Marines seem to have a deep sense of guilt and shame about killing their enemies that has seldom been reported in the histories or individual accounts.  Hanks and Spielberg seem to have found a deep vein of American guilt and shame about Guadalcanal, Pelelieu, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa.  I'm glad my father's not alive to see it.

This movie actually caused me to forgive Zac Efron for being that guy from High School Musical. He gave a very mature and convincing performance as Charlie. The kid who played his brother, Charlie Tahan, gave an equally effective and brilliant performance as Sam St. Cloud. Hope to see Tahan in more things soon. The story is very well done and the direction is strange and heart crushing.   I give this a 10 out of 10.

B00164GDA0|5.0|One of the best (if not the best) coming of age movies of all time. This movie has it all. It has murder mystery. It has misunderstood young men. It has hoodlums. It has flashbacks. And it has cussing cause it's cool. Although none of these actors, with the exception of Kiefer Sutherland, went on to make very major careers, maybe in River Phoenix's case because of his suicide, they all gave very convincing performances. The story was phenomenally captivating.From the start you won't want to stop, it is so much fun. It is a very serious movie, but at the same time it has a lot of well placed humor. All the characters have very distinctive and very likable personalities. The only thing I didn't like was the end where they told us what became of the boys as adults, and said the \\"bad boy\\" was going to turn his life around but was stabbed. Stephen King seems to like to kill kids (another example of this is \\"The Mist\\" where the father is forced to shoot his own son). This movie is a timeless classic. I will cherish it forever, and will definitely show this to my children.

B00002SSKI|1.0|Some say this is an inspirational movie for young girls. Just so you know, they are wrong! If you're a parent do not show this to your child. It promotes sexism in the worst ways. The girls a children are all persecuted by boys. This is taken to the absolute extreme. This is not like real life. Every interaction with the boys these girls have they act as if they are being attacked. In response they proceed to become violent physically, verbally, and by their actions. This is a horrible movie and a bad influence. 0/10. Do not watch it, stay away from this disgusting movie.

1416596097|3.0|There are those who believe the end of the Cold War was the worst thing that could have happened to Le Carre, whose most memorable novels all depicted the shadow war between the West and the Soviet Union. The more I read of Le Carre's recent works, the more I sadly have to agree. He was particularly skilful in depicting the clash between two ideologies, the nasty silent intrigues that went on between Moscow and London and Washington, the sometimes deadly games played by the spies of both sides who believed they were in the right because their cause was superior. This murky world is gone and the actors today are motivated by money or crime or the need to commit acts of violence. Although you could argue that terrorists are motivated by their own ideology, it's clear Le Carre has lost his old subtle skills of describing who does what and -- crucially -- why.        So we come to A Most Wanted Man, which tells the story of what happens when a mysterious Russian-speaking refugee turns up one day in Hamburg. Is he an innocent Chechen who has been persecuted in Russia, or is he something more ominous? He hooks up with an idealistic young female human rights lawyer, and then a British banker in his 60s becomes part of the picture. The problem is that we don't care about characters who never come off the page. Le Carre takes us into the heads of the banker and the lawyer and gives us endless paragraphs of their internal monologues, and yet we don't care. We also have to plough through far too much background about how the German secret agencies are being reorganised. A few pastiche nasty Americans appear in due course.        Far too deep into the book we discover that the real story involves a character we haven't met yet and when he appears, it's too late to make him any more believeable than anyone else we've come across so far. The story climaxes with a cartoon scene of violence and an abrupt denunciation of how the American secret agencies do their work. It's all very jarring and not at all convincing.        This really is not one of Le Carre's best works. Blame the end of the Cold War.
0316069485|5.0|The Bosch of old returns anew.  Michael Connelly's The Reversal is simply a good crime story.  Mr. Connelly returns to the laconic Detective Harry Bosch of old along with his penetrating investigative style to lay out a terrific story of a 24 year crime mystery.  Add  Bosch's combative half-brother Mickey Haller (defense attorney turned onetime special state prosecutor), mix in Haller's ex-wife along with Bosch's ex-girl friend, add in a psychopathic killer and a clever defense attorney, and you have the makings of a wonderfully complex yet engaging novel of crime, suspense, deception, and misdirection.  Mr. Connelly does what he does best, he tells a story:  Not a simple story, but a complex noir of the LA crime beat.  The plot centers on the re-trail of the psychopathic killer, Jason Jessup.   After serving 24 years for the kidnapping and killing of a 12 year old girl, Jessup's sentence is overturned when DNA evidence on the victim is determined NOT to be his, but that of the girl's stepfather.  Yet everything points to Jessup's guilt.  A re-trail is called, Haller is made special prosecutor for political reasons, and Harry Bosch is made the lead investigator.  The legal games begin and Bosch does what he does best--Investigates.    The Reversal is a non-stop legal thrill ride with numerous twists, turns, misdirections, legal maneuvers, investigative discoveries and dead ends.  Just what happened on that Sunday morning 24 years ago?  That's for you to find out.  Outstanding character development.  Intricate plot and wonderful character development is what Michael Connelly does best.  Combining investigative realism with the vagaries of the law, along with gritty characters has the stamp of a Connelly thriller.  Don't let the title fool you, it is yet another indicator of Connelly's sly tradecraft.  Nothing appears as it really is and it is up to Bosch's investigative talents and Haller's legal wizardry to sleuth out the truth--whatever that is??    No gratuitous sex, language, or violence.  More trademarks of a good Connelly thriller.    Strong recommend.  I am a Michael Connelly fan.  I like in The Reversal that Mr. Connelly has returned to his early Boschian type literary style that is heavy on investigative action.  Mr. Connelly is at his best when he takes a crime mystery/puzzle and hands it off to Harry Bosch to solve.  Following Bosch on this deductive, logic mystery hunt makes for a story that can't be put down.  The only real problem is turning the last page way too soon.  I enjoyed seeing Rachel Walling again-kudos for keeping the peripheral players alive, it adds to the realism and spice.  Again a strong recommend for the Harry Bosch of old.  Keep up the good work Mr. Connelly and keep Harry on the case--WE need him.
0817439390|5.0|I have recently purchased this book, and although I have read some good reviews of it, I had my reservations. I thought to myself, here is yet another photography book with loads of information that will only overwhelm a potential photography beginner. I am happy to say I was completely wrong.<br /><br />Understanding Exposure is a book written specifically to suit beginner photography level, and to explain the mechanics of photo taking process (exposure), in a simple, non-threatening way. Digital Photography at this day and age is very much technical, and given the amount of books, websites and other tutorials, both in writing and on the web can be very confusing and frustrating for a photography beginner. Therefore it is easy to forget the basics of photography, which are quite simple, and this is where Understanding Exposure book stands out above the rest. It keeps things simple. Many technical aspects such as aperture, shutter speed, and ISO are simplified to the level that anyone can understand. I have especially liked the concept of \\"who cares\\" aperture (f/8.0 and f/11).<br /><br />Bryan also encourages the reader to take control of his/her digital camera by using Manual recording mode, which at first seems to be a little backwards when comparing to what are most of the photography magazines suggesting, but it makes perfect sense. By consciously selecting aperture and shutter speed, and keeping track of camera's suggested settings for these parameters, the reader actively takes part in understanding exposure and how it works, which is the point of the book. Getting more consistent photo results than using automatic or semi-automatic recording modes (such as aperture priority, or shutter priority) is just a cherry on top.<br /><br />The book features many inspiring photos which well illustrate the concepts being explained. Many of the photos are laid out in the format before and after the point being made is taken into account.<br /><br />The appeal of this book is really for the novice to intermediate photographer. I can't think of any one subject about photography that Peterson doesn't present an explanation about. Beautiful photography, nice writing style, detailed but concise explanations makes this one a keeper. If you like the second edition you'll find the third edition invaluable.termediate photographer.

B002SF9YUM|5.0|This movie made me want to learn Spanish so I can read Lorca in the original.  All the performances are extraordinary in this movie.  Robert Pattinson gives his most complicated performance to date.  His portrayal from innocence to caricature with hints of the young artist he once was peaking through is painfully beautiful.  Matthew McNulty is another up and coming actor to watch.  In the end I believe this is really Lorca's story, a man who could never be free to be himself in his time and in his country.  It makes the ending of this movie all the more sad.  Please see this movie.

B001FB55I0|2.0|This movie was sub-par. It was just called Terminator to sell tickets. I didn't enjoy more than half of this movie. It was OK. But the other three where so much better. For those of you who scoffed at T3, I think after you saw this one you where probably more grateful for T3 than you had been. Let's hope, since they did take in a little bit of a profit, if you factor in the worldwide total, let's hope the next one is better. Let's hope they get better writers and a better director and a better soundtrack. I'd hate to see the Terminator franchise meet its own Judgement Day.
B0031OCY2E|2.0|Right from the start this film hits all the wrong notes and never really recovers. Rather mystifyingly, director Steven Soderbergh decides to treat the story of whistle blower Mark Whitacre as a 1960s comedy and as a result he strips out all the tension. Whitacre, who despite his faults must have gone through 17 versions of merry hell, carried an FBI wire for two and a half years to reveal how his employer (massive U.S. corporation ADM) was fixing the prices of substances used in foods around the world. The potential for a gritty industrial espionage story is there -- will he be caught? will he crack under the strain? -- and yet Soderbergh throws it away with wacky 1960s style upbeat music and psychedelic 1960s types fonts for the purple words that appear on the screen to let us know where the scenes are taking place. Here's the first problem -- the film is set in the first half of the 1990s.        Damon puts in an admirable performance when faced with what is a poor script. None of the characters escapes from the realm of cliches and the further we go into the film, the more confusing it becomes. We slowly learn that Whitacre was himself up to no good and at the same time he was carrying an FBI wire, he managed to steal $9 million in the form of backhanders and bribes. But that isn't funny and Soderbergh botches the job of trying to keep us laughing while letting us see that our \\"hero\\" isn't necessarily all that heroic. What is the story about? Are we supposed to be amused by a funny film where the wacky yet loveable main character has a few \\"personal flaws\\" or are we supposed to be sympathising with a man way out of his depth who is clearly deluded and slowly losing his grip on reality? The director wants to have it both ways and of course fails on both scores, so the audience is left bemused. The viewer is not helped by some frankly incoherent script writing. In one scene an FBI official seems to suggest Whitacre had been caught up in an infamous Nigerian style begging letter scam and was stealing the $9 million to cover his losses elsewhere. But we never return to the topic and it becomes one of the many loose strings that devil this movie.        This could have been an interesting film. Instead, it's a bewilderingly bad mess.
B002ZG997C|1.0|Here's the premise...<br /><br />In a post apocolyptic world, Denzel Washington is this mysterious apostle/keeper of the faith who roams around the country heading \\"west\\". When confronted, he's practically a superhero who can take on anybody and any amount of attackers. He's carrying around a Bible which is supposed to represent \\"hope\\" in this lawless, wasteland of a world. Gary Oldman, on the othe hand, is a power hungry villain who recognizes that the Bible would be an excellent tool in suppressing others, creating fear and justifying existing turmoil. He wants Denzel's Bible.<br /><br />There's two ways to evaluate this loathsome movie.<br /><br />1) As pure entertainment, it's terrible. The movie is, for the most part boring, the combat sequences are overstylish and the plot has no resolution, as though they did not where to go with this. The charactors, dialogue, and themes are preposterous.<br /><br />2) In taking this as a serious metaphor for religion, it's even worse. While I'm not a big fan of organized religion, it can be argued that if this movie was supposed to be a proponent of organized religion, it seriously backfires. This movie paints the use of the Bible in mostly evil terms. Gary Oldman practically spews the Marxian view that \\"religion is the opium of the masses\\" in explaining why the Bible would be so powerful in his hands. Even the Denzel Washington charactor, who is supposed to be righteous with his  intentions for his Bible, really does not act as that much of a hero within the film.<br /><br />There's brutality and violence that does not justify a purpose, charactor development on people that end up not being worthy of the development and a ridiculous conclusion.<br /><br />This movie came out around the same time as \\"The Road\\", another overly dark, post apocolyptic film. That film, if the \\"end of the world cinema\\" is your thing, is far superior since it's more bleak, in a realistic manner and, in a horrifying portayal, examines the mass chaos when a society is broken down (although it a well made film, it puzzles me who would get an entertainment value out of such a really sad and depressing film).<br /><br />If this movie did not have the charismatic Denzel Washington in it, it would not even be worth watching on cable.<br /><br />I would think that the only person that could enjoy this would be either an ardent aethiest or religous zealot.t a well made film, it puzzles me who would get an entertainment value out of such a really sad and depressing film).

B00001OH82|4.0|David Bowie's choice to form a band called Tin Machine in 1989 proved to be a good call. With his long solo career sputtering, this self-titled debut gave Bowie the shot in the arm that he needed. As usual, David paid little attention to musical trends as he chose a noisy pop direction over the hair metal sound that was in vogue. The fact that this album has aged quite well proves he made the right decision and it is equipped with a consistent selection of tracks that don't disappoint. \\"Heaven's In Here\\" is a great rollicking opener and this leads into the spirited title song which features a great melodic guitar line by Reeves Gabrels. Bowie's vocals are inspired throughout and the Sales brothers provide a strong foundation whether it's on the harder tracks (\\"Sacrifice Yourself\\", \\"Pretty Thing\\") or the mid-tempo melodic anthems like \\"Crack City\\" or \\"Run\\". The first single, \\"Under the God\\", is actually one of the least effective songs but is still quite good. Other strong tracks here include the moody \\"I Can't Read\\", \\"Prisoner of Love\\", and the power pop that is \\"Bus Stop\\". While no song here is on line with Bowie's best work, Tin Machine is a very good album and one I would recommend to any Bowie fan.

In telling the story of her relationship with the artist Robert Mapplethorpe Patti illuminates for the world what it means to be an artist, a friend, a lover, and a musician. Not what it means in general, but what it means TO HER. In doing so she tells fascinating, magical, poetic, passionate, charming, heartbreaking, ecstatic, romantic, whimsical, and unbelievable stories of New York City and its eclectic inhabitants, its cherished neighborhoods, and its institutions like Max's Kansas City and the Chelsea Hotel. I can't even begin to say how much I loved this book. I never wanted it to end. I want everyone in the world to read it. And I hope Patti Smith goes on to write more books because I know she has more stories to tell.

B002WN35DC|1.0|Esta versi&oacute;n del principito no est&aacute; ilustrada, y eso la vuelve p&eacute;sima. No tiene sentido leer el principito sin sus im&aacute;genes caracter&iacute;sticas. P&eacute;sima compra.
1577314808|1.0|This book takes the art of navel-gazing to incredible heights.  But I have to admit that Tolle's nonsense is coherent and consistent, a rarity among writers of drivel.  Even the Bible lacks coherency and consistency, so Tolle's achievement is notable.  I don't want to demean those who find Tolle's ideas helpful.  You have to go with what works for you, I guess.  But shouldn't we actually try to live in the real world?<br /><br />I wonder what it would be like to hold a conversation with Tolle. I'm not sure there's even a basis for discussion. I saw a Star Trek episode that visited the planet Tolle is from, or one just like it.  Everyone on that planet was \\"connected\\" to a \\"higher reality\\", each with their own \\"God-essence\\".  And they constantly shared platitudes with each other.  Here's a wonderful Tolle gem: \\"Basically all emotions are modifications of one primordial, undifferentiated emotion that has its origin in the loss of awareness of who you are beyond name and form.\\"  WOW!!  That's great!  There's no meaning in it, but it sounds wonderful!<br /><br />I suppose I should be more specific in my criticism, just to prove I actually read the book.  Okay.  Tolle says \\"Be present as the watcher of your mind - blah, blah, blah..\\"  This is a major theme with Tolle.  Again and again, he refers to this \\"animating presence within you\\" as being something distinct from the thinking you.  It's the real you.  This internal observer of consciousness, this idea of the reality underneath consciousness, is commonly referred to as a homunculus.  A little \\"me\\" in my mind that is the real me.  Unfortunately, the \\"Homunculus argument\\" has been completely debunked as logically fallacious.  It leads to an infinite regression: for Tolle to be right, someone or something has to be watching the watcher, otherwise how would you know you were in contact with the real you?<br /><br />This is just one of many problems I have with the book. Read it and enjoy if you're of a mind.  But please,never forget that you live in the real world.
B003ZTQN1I|3.0|I bought this CD and didn't realize that it has songs on it that are NOT even in the movie and does not have many songs that are! One of the songs in the movie Give in to me is not on the soundtrack by Leighton and Garrett who sings it multiple times in the movie.    I absolutely LOVED this movie. Amazing......Just super disappointed in the sountrack. I wanted more of the songs from the movie, and songs by the characters! What were they thinking?    Totally disappointed to that Faith Hill's version made it on the ablum---aggravating!!
B001AVCFK6|5.0|I have been a Star Trek fan most of my life. I can honestly say this movie was probably one of the best (If not the best) Treks I've ever seen! I can't wait for the DVD to come out. What's more I can't wait for the sequel! and it looks very likely that their will be a sequel. And with a movie this good, you can't expect anything other than the huge success it's enjoying!     The things that made it great where: The story was fantastic, people who weren't already fans of Trek could really get into it, it wasn't hard to understand, but it was still very intelligent. The music was superb! it gave it a very grand and exciting feeling! The effects where top of the line, and just plain brilliant! The humor gave it a more personal quality, so it didn't feel as stiff as it could have been. And the acting was top-notch. They really hit the nail on the head by picking the unknown Chris Pine to play James Kirk. Not only does he look like William Shatner did when he first started playing Kirk, but his acting was exceptional. And there was Zachary Quinto, he did the part of Spock so much justice, it's hard to see anyone else play him. And there was the surprise appearance of Leonard Nimoy (the original Spock) playing Older Spock. He really tied the story together. And not to forget, there was also the wonderful performances of Zoe Saldana, Anton Yelchin, John Cho, Karl Urban, and Eric Bana. Also the children that played Kid Kirk (Jimmy Bennett) and Kid Spock (Jacob Kogan) gave masterful performances for the short background story parts they where tasked with.     So that is why I say this movie was a triumph in every way! Not just as a Star Trek film but as any film! I give this movie a 10 out if 10! If they'd let me I'd give it a 20 out of 10!!!
B000JQU4TW|4.0|It felt longer than the actual (approx) 280 paper pages it is. I skipped over some of Dorian's ranting about 60% through. I've never skimmed like that... Even in Anne of Green Gables. Aside from the tangents on his experiences abroad and the scents of different flowers and such, it was a good read. Nice ending, but I feel like it was a bit abrupt.<br /><br />SIDE NOTE ON TECHNICALLY EBOOK ASPECTS:<br />The chapters are not recognized by Kindle. You cannot advance by chapter as in other books.
B003UBTX72|5.0|The short and sweet of this book is it is what you would expect from Keith, but so much more. This guy is the god of rock.
B003R0LBVW|1.0|I couldn't even finish the book. While I enjoy Franzen's style, I cannot find one redeeming quality in any of the characters (a complaint I also had about The Corrections - although, the characters in that novel were so interesting, I couldn't put the book down). More importantly, I really didn't care what happened to them. What is all the hype about this book, seriously?
B001NLKWLW|4.0|I really thought the book started out a little slow and was concerned because it was sooooo big.  However, midway, it really picked up and i found it hard to put down.
B001LF4ARC|2.0|In a nutshell: If you like to know a bit more about Steve Jobs and his business practices, this book is an `ok' read. Don't however expect any tangible `business lessons' like the book suggests in the cover.    This book is for people who don't know where Steve Jobs came from. There shouldn't be many of you out there, since he is the world's most well known CEO and his story is told in blogs, magazines and the news about every 2 hours.    The book was finished in late 2007 when Apple had just launched the iPhone and there was no iPad in sight, which surely was an interesting time in Apple's history. At the time the iPhone was a closed platform, so there was no app store either (launched mid 2008).    Downsides  268 pages for this book is waaaay too much. There is too much repetition and all the information contained in some chapters could have just been said with one or to paragraphs. 150 pages would have been enough.    Then again, some crucial things were barely mentioned.  Although the book talked a about a few mistakes Jobs had made throughout the years, it didn't lay any insight to some of the more crucial mistakes Apple made while Steve was there, such as with Apple's Lisa, the predecessor of the Apple Macintosh; it was only mentioned ONCE! Also, the only thing the book mentioned about Steve's departure from Apple in 1985 was that \\"he quite before Sculley could fire him\\". Hmm.. I would have would like to have read a bit more on than, how about you?    Upsides  On the plus side, the book did offer some information that I didn't know although I've been following Apple closely since 1999.
B001FB563E|5.0|This was a very good movie. It was a frightening look at what could happen in the future, but hopefully won't. I would reccommend this to anyone who likes Stephen King type movies.
0596805888|5.0|I've enjoyed paging through this book and reading a bit at a time.  I keep it in the kitchen and browse through it while waiting.  The recipes are quite good too, and it's gotten me interested in sous vide cooking.    The only thing I find corny is the description of the 'hacker' mentality.  I write software for a living and I always cringe when I read descriptions of how a \\"cool hacker\\" is supposed to think.  The rest of the book is much better than these few introductory pages.
B003P4MTSY|5.0|As far as a movie, I didn't like the first two films at all. Tried to take it too seriously. This one was way over the top in the way that the deaths were actually funny at points. That being said the movie itself was okay. The 3-D was extremely good though. If you want to use more pro glasses that is fine but the included paper glasses work just fine in filtering the images. No ghosting that I could notice and the image assembly was near perfect. This was not New Line's first 3D release and it shows. Extremely good 3D release. A lot of out of screen effects in the first half of the movie which don't really work well with anaglyph but the second half of the movie kinda calmed down on wowing the audience and went more for depth which worked very well. As far as anaglyph, yes the paper glasses mess up the color but if you want better, spend a few grand on a system that'll give you a siezure. This is as good as it gets.

B000PMLFRA|5.0|First:    I heart Star Wars.  I think I've bought every previously-available edition.    Second, and in terms that I think you will grasp:    If this release doesn't include an excellent and pure remaster of unaltered original film footage, I think you're going to find that one of the numerous people who have re-cut the previous releases to make them more accurate and palatable will also rip these BDs and do the same.  Then, as so often happens, they will probably share the results with the world, free of charge.  Then, the people who can't stand what you've unilaterally done to their childhood memories will go and download those results, because it's the only way to get a high-quality transfer of what they *really* want.  In the process, they will put zero nickels in your pocket.    On the other hand, if you release BDs that either contain just the original material, or contain it as an additional disc, I think you'll find that most traditionalists will go against their better judgment and actually give you even more of their hard-earned money, just for the sake of having legitimate hardcopies.  (As an aside: see Bartholomew Boge's review for excellent suggestions regarding the specifics of re-mastering.)    It's your call, George... it's not rocket science... do you want more of my money, or not?
B003YFIUW8|5.0|This is an amazing book told through the eyes and heart of a 5 year old little boy. At first I was skeptical reading this book being a mother myself but I just fell in love with the book. A quick read that will have you thinking about it for days!
B00003CXPD|5.0|What's not to like about this film. It is a masterpiece in every way. It shows that a boy can participate in something that is generally reserved for girls and not be a homosexual. In fact Billy's friend was there to show that Billy was not gay but that he accepted his friend for who he was. It showed that even the most intolerant of parents can be turned to support their child once they see how much it means to them and what talent they have, even in the worst situations. All the performances where great from the adults to the kids. Jamie Bell was a master a \\"Billy\\". I'm glad to see that he has become an A-list British actor and that he is getting so many starring roles. He deserves it, his acting is golden. 10/10 all around for this move, which in my book is a timeless classic with a great message, and a must watch for anyone with an once of tolerance.
B00428CPUY|5.0|So much coolness on these two discs...For me, the stuff I keep repeat listening to is the Susan Tedeshi/Derek Trucks set. All those numbers, including the tunes with Warren Haynes especially are just superb songs. A highpoint of musicality and energy. Derek Trucks playing with his fingers is just wildly talented, both soloing with and without the slide and his great rhythym playing, ditto for Warren Haynes, not to mention his great , bluesy voice. Susan Tedeshi's singing is just perfect and the crack band with backup singers, horns and TWO drummers (wow) was excellent. What a great concert Tedeshi/Trucks must be! I also really dug Bright Lights Big City by Gary Clark Jr. who I'd never heard of before. The climatic ending was great to watch with all the guitarists coming out to jam with BB King, if not quite awe-inspiring playingwise,  you do have to genu-flect on the great ones playing.  As on the on the first Crossroads discs a couple years ago , Jeff Beck was what I was most looking forward to...and he delivers. Loved his fusion tunes and his trademark expressiveness, especially on the 2nd tune. The sound quality is top notch and nicely filmed. You will most surely find something to enjoy here! The only slight letdown was oddly enough, Eric Clapton...his tunes didn't have a lot of energy the way Tedeshi/Trucks did, but still cool nonetheless. Something minor but cool, ..that looping music of a lone, droning dobro guitar at the disc menu and the pics there and on the setup,options etc was really cool.
0553381687|5.0|\\"A Game of Thrones\\" is a deep, broad and compelling work of medieval-style fantasy. I'm not a reader of much fantasy, but after watching a preview of the new HBO series (starting in April 2011), I found myself drawn in by the mystique, texture and composition of the story.<br /><br />The twisting and extensive story is equal parts medieval historical fiction and fantasy. The book is long at over 700 pages, many taken up with well-crafted character development and exposition. The scenery, outfits, and activities are very middle ages European: well-hewn swords, knights in armor that gleams in a multitude of metallic shades, both honor and treachery are driving motivations for characters at all levels of the social stratosphere. There's a wee bit of magic, a zombie or two, and no fantasy-themed story can go too long without dragon lore.<br /><br />The characters and backstories are plentiful and complicated. Martin has written detailed histories on all of the royal houses in an appendix and it will take more than a few references in your reading to get your arms around and feel comfortable with who's who and which houses are allies and which are enemies.<br /><br />The core of the story revolves around the mysterious death of a key advisor to the king. His wife sends a message to her sister suggesting that the death was murder. This plot point is only a small device used as a launching point for the exploration of Martin's incredibly rich universe. Two houses are at odds...House Stark, led by the infinitely honorable, patient and noble Eddard Stark, and House Lannister, led by the irrepressibly conniving Cersei, Queen of the Seven Kingdoms and inheritor of a bloodline of dubious quality.<br /><br />\\"Game of Thrones\\" is heavy...in details, exposition, in character development, and in world-building. It's not light reading, but it's fulfilling. \\"Thrones\\" is the first in a series by Martin and while some stories are built and resolved within \\"Thrones\\", very little is truly concluded. I find my mind drifting back To Martin's world a few days after I finished reading, and I think it won't be long before I return to the land of \\"Thrones\\".fting back To Martin's world a few days after I finished reading, and I think it won't be long before I return to the land of \\"Thrones\\".
B0040T7B2W|5.0|I own all of the B&S albums and have seen them in concert twice.  They are fabulous and I love every album they have released.  They may have different sounds, but for the most part, they are all connected and all fabulous.  I think this album is really great.  The more recent albums have been a little more \\"pop\\" sounding, but that does not bother me.  I like it!  They also have a couple of songs on this album that feature other artists, such as Norah Jones.  How can you not like that!?!

I always look forward to Sunday night..and what's so great about ShowTime is programs are repeated often.

In many parts of the novel where the author mentioned racing techniques, he actually wanted to show us how to live a successful life.  I will definitely keep this novel on my shelf for a long time.

0061537969|5.0|We lost our beloved Golden retriever, Oliver, in November of canine lymphoma at 6 years of age. We were heartbroken. This book was recommened to me and I laughed and cried and couldn't put it down. If only I could find another book narrated by a dog, I would be thrilled. Garth Stein did a phenominal job on writing and researching dogs and their behaviors. The story of Enzo, Denny, Eve and Zoe was happy, sad, full of love and heartbreak and most of all - sacfrice for those you love. I highly receommend this book. We are now the proud owners of a 5 month old Black lab named Marley. He is a true joy in our lives, but I hope Oliver knows that he will always be loved and have a place in our hearts.

B00005JPKE|5.0|Clint Eastwood's Letters from Iwo Jima is an exceptional film. It has a meditative tone that artfully evokes the individual's existential experience of war. It reminded me of Malick's The Thin Red Line; futility, chaos, insanity, honor, all abundantly present, and visually beautiful. Between sepia and black & white coloring, the isolation and spareness of the Japanese fortification of Iwo Jima in anticipation of the U.S. attack is palpable in it's sadness and doom.   What stands out as well, is Eastwood's ability to present a film humanizing all soldiers. even enemies of his/our own country.   The film succeeds as a work of art in uniting it's audience with the story, a tale of a horrible war amidst the soulful need for peace and camaraderie. The following is a poem attributed to the Japanese General Tadamichi Kuribayashi, beautifully played by Ken Watanabe.                 Sadness overcomes me as I am unable to fulfill my duty for my country,      Bullets and arrows are no more      I, falling in the field without revenge,      Will be reborn to take up my sword again.      When ugly weeds run riot over this island,      My heart and soul will be with the fate of the Imperial nation.    There is a significant amount of violence in the film, very realistic, appropriate and visceral. In particular there is a scene, without giving it away, that recasts the Japanese tradition of Seppuku in a modern context. The significant cultural traditions and attitudes that are essential to Japan are relevant to understanding this film, and are a worthwhile reason for presenting this film in an educational circumstance.   A beautifully somber experience, Letters from Iwo Jima is easily one of Eastwood's greatest works.
B0045HCJGC|5.0|This 90's Scifi classic turns the man from the past genre on its head.  featuring the classic pairing of Pratt and Bullock as partners.  and dennis leary in his cleanest live action role as the down and dirty Edgar Friendly.  and of course everbody's favorite high class resturant Taco Bell
B004GNYGTI|3.0|This move starts out great, solid action sequences and a very interesting plot line. This falls apart quickly and turns to a much more campy anti-soviet plot-line that really lost it for me.  Still has some good action sequences and ends up entertaining, but this fails to live up to the excellent ad campaign the preceded it.
B002JWD6AS|3.0|you know i really like this book but it reminds me a lot of twilight werewolves and fighting for love keeping lots of secrets and ignoring the parents it was well written and i almost liked the plot but by the end i was a little disappointed
B000002AH9|5.0|This cd is Lady in Satin indeed-smooth, silky and elegant. I must give credit to Coco Chanel's No. 5 perfume commercial for bringing my attention to this wonderful songtress' voice when I heard one of the songs \\"I'm a fool to want you\\". It aroused my curiousity who the singer was and so I searched on the internet which indicated it was the incomparable Billie Holiday that sang this sultry piece. All the songs on \\"Lady in Satin\\" are beautiful and relaxing to listen to, especially on rainy days. The sound and pitch is excellent.

B003ZTQN1I|2.0|I just saw the movie tonight and was so excited to get the CD.  I'm sure glad I read the reviews & description of the CD because like a previous reviewer, I'm disappointed that many of the songs are not sung by the artists that sang them in the movie.  I'm particularly disappointed to see that Garrett Hedlund has only one song on the CD.  Because of this, I've decided my collection can do without this CD.  If I want to listen to the music, I can watch the DVD when it comes out.

B002ZG997C|4.0|I do not like long reviews.  If I wanted to read a book, I would go buy a book!<br />With that said, 'The book of Eli' was a good movie, nothing more.<br />I always enjoy watching Denzel and don't believe he has done enough work over the<br />years.  He was believable (as was Gary Oldman who I was first introduced to from watching 'The Professional' as a drug crazed cop) in this movie, but I am afraid poor Mila Kunis has sadly been type cast (as has Ashton Kutcher) by the many years of being the stuck up, money grubbing, ditz on the long running 'That 70's show' on TV and was even less believable in 'Max Payne'.  Don't get me wrong, I like Mila, but her style does not change and it seems as though she cannot get into the part. Kudos to her for bagging some nice acting parts though, even if, (in my opinion) she pulled both the stated movies down.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|This thing has really made pc gaming more enjoyable.  I use the thumbstick for movement which frees up my fingers to access more programmable buttons.  The lcd screen is a must have for controlling vent and giving all kinds of great info without alt-tabbing out.  It's comfortable for gaming all day long and through the night.  The backlight can be set to any color.  The software has built in flash tutorials which make programming macros and setting everything up so easy.  Everything about it is fantastic.
0689865384|2.0|When I picked up this book, it was not in the youth section. False advertising!!! I really felt there should have been some warning before I wasted half a day reading this. The writing is completely one-dimensional. This could've been an epic novel, but instead it is a predictable teen love story/clich&eacute;d action adventure.  If you are an adult looking for a really insightful book, keep looking. If you are a teenage girl of low to average intelligence, this may be the book for you.
B004BSEKH6|4.0|I listen to some of the songs... Not all, but the CD does give people a view of some of her singing abilities. Some songs made no sense, but it's Nicki Minaj. I wouldn't expect any different.
B0001I55OC|5.0|I thought this movie was great! I don't think the science behind this movie was accurate, but the movie seemed believable and was full of non-stop action. The movie was fast paced and kept moving from beginning to end. I thought Gerard Butler was wonderful in this movie and the special effects was very good. If you like Gerard Butler or fantasy action movies, then you'll like this movie. Just keep in mind that the science they're using is not accurate and probably made up, but the movie makers and actors make it sound believable and real.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|This item was purchased as a Christmas gift for my dad who is really into War history as am I. He and i watxched a good bit of it together. It is awesome.

B0007PLLQ0|1.0|I enjoyed this movie as a kid and bought it recently to re-live some old memories.  I was beyond disappointed when I realized it was what the director refers to as an \\"enhanced\\" version of the film. The scenes are completely different, some are missing all together, and some are completely new.  The music is also 100 percent different from the original and it completely changes the entire film. They refer to it as the \\"enhanced Jerry Goldsmith Score\\" and it literally ruined the whole experience.  After about an hour, I had to turn off the film and switch to the old VHS version I have had for years.  I was very disappointed.  Make sure you order the original if you want to enjoy this movie
B003A9WLCS|5.0|This CD is a must! It's great for any and everything. I personally listen to \\"The Moon and The Sky.\\" It's rare that you can find a CD that you and your grandmother can both listen to.
0143118420|4.0|I absolutely enjoyed this book. If you wander through my library you will notice that this is not my usually type of book. It is also not easy to classify this work. It is a travel/journey reflection...a reflection not only on the external world of travel but the internal world of the heart and soul. Elizabeth Gilbert does outstanding job in interweaving both journeys through these realms and taking us to a larger meaning that embodies both realms. She creates wonderful metaphors and contrasts in illuminating her own growth and awareness through this exotic global trip. Her writing is very engaging on many levels. I found it be humorous, ironic, inspiring and very touching. I recommend this book to anyone looking for guiding principles to add to their life...anyone wanting to change or evolve their life...and anyone of a romantic heart, wondering soul and an optimistic mind. This is worth your time.

In Absentia is simply incredible.  Every song is great!!!  What else can I say accept just another great CD by PT.  Every CD by this band is awesome. Porcupine Tree are relatively unknown in the US.  They are much bigger in Europe because they are from the UK.  If you like Pink Floyd or Tool or both then run out and buy all of their CD's!!!!  I love Porcupine Tree!!!  Steve Wilson is a musical genious!
B004132HZS|3.0|The BBC builds an impressive track record of movie achievements by taking a known story and contextualising in a different time or place. Examples include Wallander ( Swedish detective series with an English spoken dialogue) the Shakespeare retold series ( 4 key plays are conceived in  today's settings) and now Sherlock stays true to Conan Doyle's formulation inclusive of 221B Baker Street and arch enemy Moriarty but in the setting of contemporary London. This initial series comprises 3 episodes each of 90 minutes. The lead actor Benedict Cumberbatch plays Sherlock but could be mistaken as Dr. Who. The series is jolly good fun and the conclusion leaves the viewer wanting.
B000054OTY|4.0|I have always considered this film one of Marlon Brando's best, possibly because I love a well-written Western, the likes of which are far and few between now; and is the main reason why I revisited this one after all these years.  It is worth the revisit.    The story line, as in many before it, begins with the classic double-cross.  Partners in crime, an older outlaw, (Karl Maldin) and a younger one (Brando) rob what will be their last bank together and in the ensuing chase, are brought down on a hill when one of the horses is shot out from under them.  The posse swarming below, Brando stays to defend himself while Maldin takes the sound horse and makes good his escape, and the double-cross has begun handsomely.      After Brando escapes from prison and aided by another escapee, he plots revenge and sets out to track Maldin down.  He doggedly searches the \\"honkey tonks and bars\\", finds word of Maldin and ultimately locates Maldin himself, resplendent in political security as a powerful figurehead in a magnificent little Coastal town, married to a fading Spanish beauty, Katy Jurado, and very successfully practicing a charade as a family man. He doesn't need to see his old abused partner hover on the horizon after all this time, but there he is and he needs to deal with him.  As they size each other up again, in magnificent hypocritical \\"glad to see you\\" jousting, they both start forming their opposing plans.    Pina Pellicer turned in what I felt was an absolutely superb performance in her part as Karl Malden's untouched, honest and genteel step daughter - in fact, she developed her role far beyond what it actually was designed to do. This girl, while of no great beauty, had the potential to be a character actress extraordinaire, which unfortunately was never fulfilled in her own life. Katy Jurado, in the supporting role, is quiet in \\"carefully cultivated elegance\\" belying her past - as the still-beautiful, world wise and anxious mother of Pina, a mother who recognizes all the signs and symptoms as her daughter begins to fall for the handsome desperado she knows nothing about but suspects the worst - because she herself has been there twenty years before.    The photography alone is worth watching the film. And Karl Maldin is undoubtedly one of the elite character actors of his time; a guy who can make a villain come to life right before your eyes.

0143116738|5.0|Sir Ken Robinson delivers a compact dissertation on what makes people happy: it's when they arrive at the intersection where their natural aptitude and personal passion meet. That's when people do what they love, and in the process, they feel like their most authentic selves; they are in their element. When people are in their element, they connect with something fundamental to their sense of identity, purpose, and well-being.<br /><br />In this surprisingly candid and conversational book, he sets out with a singular focus in describing what the element is, how to recognize it in yourself, and how parents and teachers can help students capitalize on it.<br /><br />With inspirational stories of people who have found and work in their element such as musician Mick Fleetwood, actress Meg Ryan, animator and creator of the Simpsons Matt Groening, choreographer/actress Debbie Allen, renowned photographer Gordon Parks, rapper and business mogul Jay-Z, and my personal favorite, author Susan Jeffers (\\"The Fear And Do It Anyway\\"), illustrate his point, and provide didactic lessons for all.<br /><br />If you are an educator like myself, you probably already have heard of Ken Robinson who delivers a genius presentation on TED Talks about education reform. At the end of this book he briefly touches upon it by stating we don't need education reformation, we need education transformation. I agree. Examples of what works better exist - he points them out.<br /><br />Education reform is a tired conversation, and this book is not about that, per se. Rather, this book is about the role that education can (and often does not) play in helping us discover our element. In fact, the eye-opening passage is in the chapter entitled \\"Elemental Education,\\" where Ken states that many of the aforementioned people went through the whole of their education without really discovering their true talents. That in fact, many of them did not discover their real abilities until after they left school and recovered from their education...<br /><br />This book is EXCELLENT! Take that from a professional, parent, and person who is in his element helping others find their element.n...    This book is EXCELLENT!

0061537969|5.0|I recently lost my husband and soul mate of 41 years- very sudenly-very unexpectedly--totally unprepared for being alone without him.  My dog has been my single source of comfort-- as he also misses his alpha male.  This book was recommended to me by an almost-stranger; someone I had just met yet had empathy for the grief and \\"aloneness\\" I am feeling. Enzo--what an inspiring reflection of how human's behave, think, process, feel.  A dog's perspective of the important, relavant and inspirational events in our lives.  This book brought me comfort, tears, laughter and a deeper understanding of my grief.  Enzo was strong enough and wise enough to know when to die and Denny was kind enough and compassionate enough to give him permission to do so without remorse.  Wonderful. Very easy read- simple yet poignant.  Thank you Garth Stein.
B003IGMJ34|3.0|Taken By Force is one of the best of what most people would call \\"early\\" Scorpions, that is to say Scorpions music before the 1980's commercial successes like Blackout and Love at First Sting.  In the 70's, with guitarist Uli Jon Roth, Scorpions were a somewhat harder-edged, less commercialized sounding band.  Notable tracks here include Steamrock Fever, We'll Burn the Sky, Sails of Charon, He's a Woman, She's a Man.  This disc comes well-packaged, with the original (Mini) album cover deemed offensive by some at the time of its release.      Of interest to many fans of the band is the fact that this CD contains the \\"complete\\" Sails of Charon, a great song, with fantastic guitar work.  On issues subsequent to the original LP and CD, editors chopped off the first 45 seconds of the song.  It is here in its complete version.      Also of interest may be the technical aspects of this \\"Blu-Spec CD\\".  According to my research, what this means is that the same type of laser used to create Blu-ray video discs is used to create these CD's, which supposedly results in more accuracy in the pits on the CD surface that are read by the CD player.  More accurate encoding presumably means more accuracy, less read-error during playback, though some question the validity of this argument, noting that most CD players with typical error correction don't need better encoding.  You may want to consider this against the cost of this CD.  If I had to do this purchase over again...well, I'll save that for the end of the review.      Last, this disc is advertised as having been remastered in 2010 and indeed it appears to have been remastered, but not necessarily in a way that everyone will like.   Those who enjoy constant loudness and little dynamic range in their music (or who listen primarily on an iPod or mobile device) will probably enjoy this remastering.  It is LOUD - looking at the waveform on EAC, one can see that on many tracks most of the song is likely compressed and brickwalled -once the main part of the tune gets going, volume is maxed.  Not all parts of each song are maxed out, but about 80-90% of each track is so.  So while you can hear more detail in some parts of some songs, there is little difference between the soft and loud sections of the music.  I cannot hear audible distortion or clipping, so that has been avoided at least; but there is no depth or soundstage - it is simply all loud.  For me, it is not pleasant to listen to for long periods.  I was hoping that this Blu_Spec disc would be more of a Deluxe Edition type issue, where remastering has been used to bring out more from the master tapes, where the latest technology could be used to give us a much more dynamic, but detailed version of this great album.  Honestly, after listening to the music and assessing the waveforms afterward, I came away very disappointed with this CD.    So if I had to do this over again, I don't think I would buy this disc for the price being asked.  Some may enjoy it, but for me, the minuses outweighed the plusses and the cost was just too high.
0765326353|3.0|Should you read this book? If you like Robert Jordan, you don't need to read another word of this review, just buy the book. If you thought that Robert Jordan's books went on for thousands of unnecessary pages, then you could think twice about reading Sanderson's The Way of Kings. If you liked Sanderson's other novels, this book is weaker, but still decent.       Some reviewer have written that this was Sanderson's best book yet. I disagree. I believe that [[ASIN:0765360039 Warbreaker]], the [[ASIN:076536543X Mistborn novels]], and [[ASIN:0765350378 Elantris]] were all superior books to The Way of Kings. All of those books were more quickly paced and you didn't wonder if Sanderson had lost the thread of the story in a desire to explore the world he had created.     I liked the book, especially the last 200 pages, but the book was just way too long. If the book had just been edited down by about 400 pages, the book would have been really enjoyable as opposed to merely pleasant. But far too often the story languished as Sanderson took unnecessary detours and dawdled with unimportant side stories.      This series could be really good, but Sanderson will need something Robert Jordan never had--an editor serious about telling a story, not exploring a world.
B000LPQ6DE|4.0|I really enjoyed this adaptation of Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre.  However, I think it would score higher on the top lists of period dramas if Masterpiece Theatre hadn't taken the liberties it did with this piece.  There are few scenes that are totally shameless, as in, nude and promiscuous.  The first time I watched this movie, I think I might have thrown something at the T.V., yelling, \\"That was not in the novel!\\"  Jane Eyre is a classic without these scenes and therefore they should never have been added to the movie.  However, the movie is still great, just be aware of these scenes.

0765356139|5.0|I'm really not sure about the complaints on this book.  It picks up about a year after the last book ends and it had me on the edge of my seat the entire time.  I will agree that there is a lot of information in the middle that can be interpreted as unimportant, but I believe the slow progression of the characters is absolutely necessary in order to connect the dots to where Elend and Vin start and end the novel.  Also, what is a book without suspense?  If he got right to the heart of the story, right away, this book would be 150 pages and make absolutely no sense...<br /><br />I loved the second half of The Final Empire, after having almost given up on the book during the first half.  If you don't enjoy suspense and realistic character development, well, then I guess you'll be disappointed by The Well of Ascension, but I thought that this book was even better than the first one.
0756405890|5.0|Do yourself a favor and read this book. This book deserves a place in the pantheon of fantasy novels with Tolkien and a few others. It is that good.    Rothfuss' writing is superb. The characters are fantastic. The pacing is excellent. The story is well constructed. I really can't do the book justice, so just read it.     My only quibble is that Rothfuss is too much of a perfectionist and it taking too long to finish the series. In an interview he said that he added a section of this book during a re-write that he felt really improved that book. The irony was that I thought that the section he referred to was boring and pointless and could have been cut with nothing of value left out of the book.
0679735909|1.0|The book's plot is slow moving, with the conflict not urgent enough to keep the reader's interest.  There are too many poems and other inserted pieces of writing that do not quite fit, and infact, interrupt the reader's train of thought, hoping it will lead to something....but rather it feels like a dead end.  I am sad that I wasted so many hours on this book, only to put it down about 1/5 of the way in.  It was a sincere struggle to even go that far.
B002BSHXJA|1.0|I purchased my Beatles Mono boxed set from a very nice seller in Hawaii.When it got to me in 3 days it was sealed and the whole package was in perfect condition. The individual cd's were in plastic jackets just like the official release. The only problem is that cd's were in stereo. The dead giveaway is on HELP! and RUBBER SOUL there should be 28 tracks if it is an official mono set (each has the mono album + the 1965 stereo mix). On the PLEASE PLEASE ME and WITH THE BEATLES cd's the stereo versions have the vocals on one side and the instrumentals on the other. The mono versions of these 2 albums have everything centered. Also on the MONO MASTERS you will have the four tracks from \\"Yellow Submarine\\" (\\"All Together Now\\", \\"It's All Too Much\\", \\"Hey Bulldog\\", and \\"Only A Northern Song\\") in mono. The stereo \\"Past Masters\\" does not have these four tracks. I believe that a lot of these sellers do not know the difference between the sets and that is why I wanted to list these discrepencies. The only defect I noticed on the actual discs was on THE WHITE ALBUM, disc one. Tracks 9-11 have a clicking sound in the background. I hope this review helps people, although as I said the copy that I got did not have any of the glitches on the box or on the cd's that I have read about. It was of course sealed so no one could have played it and noticed that it was in stereo. I would say any BEATLES MONO BOX that is sealed and in the $100-125 dollar range is probably what I got. I have no idea how much you will need to spend to get a true MONO BOX, probably around $150-200.

B002ZG99A4|3.0|The Expendables definitely didn't live up to all the hype. I will say it is a striaght-up, pure action flick. I expected to see something at least close to the latest Rambo or even Rocky Balboa, seeing that Stallone also wrote this one; but the story was incredibly weak.  Pros:   - decent action flick  - great cast  - explosions galore  Cons:  - storyline  - acting  - unrealistic  The pros are self explanitory; great action, cast and explosions. The cons tho; I mean Stalone can write and has written a number of great screenplays. This one...not so much. The acting was rediculous; Stallone and Statham were good, but you can't really understand Lundgren's lines; Li, Crewes, and Austin can't act in the first place and Rourke, Arnold and Willis were all cameos.  I'm not saying this was a bad movie; which is why it got 3 stars...but I would recommend as a rental since I have no motivation to watch this one again.

Every visual that was described in any detail in the book, for instance, what the cabins at Camp look like, is completely different in the film.  Major and minor characters are left out.

B001BTG3OQ|5.0|I just got my first SB 900; I currently have 3 sb 600's and a su 800 (I have started my own home studio). I was using a pair of 20 x 20 softboxes and I wasn't getting the light I need for a proper photo. I rented a  pair of sb 900s, placed them in the same softboxes. The pictures are now perfect. I plan on replacing all of the sb 600's with sb 900s. The interface is very easy to use. I read the manual, then went to youtube for a few extra tips. The 600 has an interface that is very challening to use when changing to the different modes. The 900 has a switch to go from commander, remote or on camera. I have preprogrammed the commander mode to the same set up as the su 800, with a flick of the switch in the first 10 minutes of ownership. I can remove it from remote mode and it can be come the commander of all of the flashes. I highly recommend anyone thinking about getting a Nikon flash to get the 900, you will be glad you did.

0141439807|4.0|This is only the second Austen novel I have read and while I enjoyed the other to some degree (\\"Persuasion\\" being that other), I found much more to engage with in \\"Mansfield Park\\".  I know enough about Jane Austen to know that Fanny Price, this novel's main character, is quite different from other Austen leading ladies.  Quiet, shy, introspective, a wallflower exhibiting no real drive, Fanny seems to serve merely as the pair of eyes through which we are to observe the ridiculous happenings at Mansfield Park.<br />  Coming from a humbler, living in the seediness of London background, a young Fanny Price is taken under the wing of a well-to-do, better off Aunt, who resides in the country at Mansfield Park.  Fanny never really feels at home with this adopted family, and her only real friendship exists with Edmund, her cousin who is studying to enter the seminary.  Through the lens that Fanny's muted observations grant us, we discover that this wealthy half of her family- by society's then standards, the better half- we discover that this group of cousins, aunts and uncles, parents and children- essentially do nothing but ride horses, take walks, put on plays, flirt, and eat.  In one hilarious conversation, the younger generation is caught putting on a play by the elder statesman when he suddenly returns home from a trip.  Apologizing profusely, Edmund, who seems to represents the more rational side of the family, admits that they would have been better off doing nothing, because that is what they are good at.<br />  Austen paints a breathing and vibrant picture of this family and despite all their obvious flaws, eventually gets Fanny, and in a way the reader, to feel warmth toward them and their selfish eccentrities.  When Fanny eventually gets the chance to return to London and spend time with her own family, who she has not seen in years, their rudeness and roughness turns her off, and makes her long even more for the Mansfield Park to which she never really felt a part.<br />  Romance, seductions, deceit, manipulation- the story is filled with enough plot and intrigue to keep the novel breathing apart from its more satirical elements.  Without revealing too much, Austen keeps a surprise or two in her back pocket and whips them out towards the end of the book, in a way subverting everything you think she may have been trying to accomplish thus far.<br />  Great characters, lots of story, and an ending that illustrates how well thought out every page of this book was.  Well deserving of (from what I have been told) the Austen Brand!art.<br />  Romance, seductions, deceit, manipulation- the story is filled with enough plot and intrigue to keep the novel breathing apart from its more satirical elements.

B000EQ5SRK|4.0|This is quite a good Sexual Thriller. There are some red herrings in the film and some tense moments. Performances by Stone, Baldwin and Berenger are good. I would have liked to have seen as extras the original ending filmed (which test audiences hated so much it had to be changed) on the dvd and the original trailer(which contained scenes that were not in the film). The book  and film did have different endings. With the exception of the end which is rushed and doesn't go into detail for the killers motives it is an enjoyable sexual thriller and a good follow up to Basic Instinct from Sharon Stone.

0316098337|5.0|Skimming through the selections for New York Times best sellers for my Kindle, I probably normally wouldn't have looked at something with such a simple name, but I saw that readers were rating it highly so I took a peek. The reviews made me curious so I bought the book on a whim.     I was a little skeptical in the first couple chapters because it took some time to get used to hearing the world from a 5 year old's perspective. Once I figured things out, it was hard to put down. The author does such an amazing job of giving you a totally different perspective of the world.     Towards the middle, it gets extremely thrilling. It was all I could do to put the book down. I was so excited, that I wes recanting the story to my boyfriend who probably could care less, but I had to tell someone.     If you are looking for a good novel and story to read, this is the book to pick up!

1594202842|5.0|My initial impression based on the NYT article was largely negative.

There is the stricken husband hiring Boone to tail his adulterous wife, and the inopportune appearance of Cruz Inglesias, head of one of the biggest and most vicious drug cartels operating on the border. There are distressingly flat seas and disastrous sinkholes and blond bombshell receptionists and crooked records clerks and even crookeder real estate developers and coitus interruptus and coitus finally efficere. Winslow is just one of the best plotting authors around (see [[ASIN:0307275345 The Death and Life of Bobby Z]] if you don't believe me) and however improbably, all of these plot strands are gathered together and knotted securely in an epic fistfight, on a beach, naturally.<br /><br />But what I really love about this novel is the voice. Here's Boone setting the scene in the first chapter and, not coincidentally, snapshotting the plot as well:<br /><br />  ...Like water, earth is always moving. You can't necessarily see it, you might not feel it, but it's happening anyway. Beneath our feet, tectonic plates are shifting, faults are widening, quakes are tuning up to rock and roll...Face it -- whether we know it or not, we're all always surfing.<br /><br />Here's Boone talking about surfers going all [[ASIN:1568361440 Robert Ardrey]] over their beach:<br /><br />  It's not that they're just taking his water, it's that they're taking his life. Without that Rockpile break, what he is is a drywaller, a roofer, a karate instructor in a strip mall. With that break, he's a surfer, a Rockpile surfer, and it means something.<br /><br />Here's Boone channeling [[ASIN:0446695661 Skink]] on real estate developers:<br /><br />  Generally speaking, Boone would have every real estate developer in Southern California put on a bus and driven over the cliff, if it wouldn't kill the bus driver. If he can find a bus-driving real estate developer, though, it's on.<br /><br />Here's Boone shopping for electronic snoopers for a case:<br /><br />  He already has the camera -- it came with the basic Private Investigator Starter Kit along with the cynicism, a manual of one-liners, and a saxophone soundtrack.<br /><br />Yeah, okay, you've met this detective before, starting with [[ASIN:0848824369 Sam Spade]] right up through [[ASIN:0425174018 Spenser]], smart, tough, outwardly cynical, inwardly romantic, always irresistible to the ladies. Boone is your average, everyday, ordinary knight of the woeful countenance. But nothing says if it's done right you don't want to watch him tilt at another windmill.<br /><br />The day after I finished The Gentlemen's Hour, I picked it up again and reread the ending, just for that epic joust on the beach.

B000SEJHRA|2.0|The series of short stories left me never truly invested in the main character (which i understand is the author). I heard so many great things, and while I found myself laughing out loud on a few occasions, I think it was overhyped before I even read it, so my expectations were most likely unrealistic.  He is a great writer, using interesting examples to illustrate this stories, but because I never felt invested in the character, I struggled to have any reason to keep reading. If any of his other books are not written in short story format i'd like to give that a try.
B00004STUL|3.0|Producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer (Beverly Hills Cop, Days Of Thunder, Top Gun), known for a slick over the top approach to action, are behind Bad Boys (1995), a big and loud extravaganza teaming Martin Lawrence and Will Smith, as Miami police detectives on the trail of millions in stolen cash and drugs.  Michael Bay (The Rock, Armageddon, Pearl Harbor, Transformers) makes his directorial debut, in this action/comedy, that sort of delivers in the action department, but not so much when it comes to laughs.<br /><br />A gang led by a criminal named Fouchet (Tcheky Karyo), engineers the audacious robbery of millions of dollars of confiscated drugs from the police evidence vault.  During the robbery, one of the team takes a bag of drugs for personal use, and arranges to party with a couple of women in a hotel.  Fouchet arrives, and eliminates his greedy collaborator and one of the ladies, but Julie Mott (Tea Leoni) manages to escape a hail of bullets, by jumping from a roof into a swimming pool.<br /><br />Rich playboy Mike Lowery (Smith), and dedicated family man Marcus Burnett (Lawrence) are Miami police detectives assigned to work on this most crucial of cases.  Lowery isn't in the office when Julie calls police headquarters, so Burnett impersonates him, and arranges to meet her.  Fouchet's men are close behind, shooting up Julie's apartment, as she and Burnett barely escape to safety with her two pet dogs.  Mott refuses to enter protective custody, so Burnett stashes her at his partner's apartment.  Burnett's boss Captain Howard (Joe Pantoliano), noisily orders him continue to impersonate Lowery, and get vital information from Julie.  Burnett moves into Lowery's bachelor pad, while Lowery takes up residence in Burnett's home with his wife Theresa (Theresa Randle) and two kids.<br /><br />Much of the remainder of the film is centered on keeping Julie believing that Burnett is actually his free-wheeling partner.  It's a fairly ridiculous situation, as Julie is certainly intelligent enough to handle the truth.  The elaborate charade provides some rather forced and predictable, low level humor.  Lawrence has fairly good chemistry with Smith, who mostly plays the straight man to Lawrence's goofing.  Bad Boys tries hard to be funny, but isn't very successful, despite Lawrence being an accomplished ad libber.  Tea Leoni, as the sharp tongued Julie, seems too bright to be involved in most of the goofiness, and at times seems out of place with her co-stars.<br /><br />The DVD commentary by Michael Bay is highly informative, though sporadic at points.  The director repeatedly states that the studio did not believe in the film, and that he was working under extreme pressure, on a very limited budget, with his directorial future at stake.  Bay says that he even paid the studio out of his own pocket, to shoot a particular scene.  Bay also relates some interesting anecdotes about stars Lawrence and Smith.  Of particular interest is the amount of improvisation that was apparently done, as apparently there were some big problems with the script.  Bay often focuses on the pressure of meeting shooting schedules, and budgetary concerns, but his investment and efforts certainly did pay off.  Bad Boys went on to make over 100 million dollars in profits, and Michael Bay has become one of Hollywood's most in demand directors.<br /><br />A fast paced film with good production values and a cartoonish plot, Bad Boys largely delivers what you might expect from a Simpson/Bruckheimer production.  With Smith and Lawrence trading barbs, this surprise performer at the box office helped launch Will Smith's movie career.  It would be followed by the more explosive and exciting, Bad Boys II in 2003.ligent enough to handle the truth.  The elaborate charade provides some rather forced and predictable, low level humor.

B004B8DH98|1.0|This movie was beautifully shot, and had nice locations. Besides that, nothing. It's so deliberately vague that it has no point.    If you have a huge screen and a HD setup, maybe it's good to play in the background while throwing a party. Don't bother watching it for any sort of entertainment value, though.    If you do watch this movie, be warned that on Amazon's video-on-demand version that the subtitles in the Italian scenes are so small and low-contrast that they're nearly impossible to read.
B001CDLATE|5.0|\\"On one level, the film is a 96-minute travelog. On another level, it is a meditation on the planet. The director, Ron Fricke, has taken his 70-mm camera all over the globe to photograph natural and human sights. Some of them are as ordinary as the traffic in Manhattan. Some are as awesome as a solar eclipse. Some are as desperate as the tribes of scavengers scuttling like crabs over the garbage dumps of Calcutta.\\" - ROGER EBERT / November 12, 1993  A must have ob Blu-ray looks amazing!
0812416236|2.0|Though I had heard of Agatha Christie and her classic Murder on the Orient Express, I didn't know much about it. However, being a fan of the Sir Aurthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes series, I was quite excited to read another classic mystery novel. Unfortunately, by the time I got halfway through the book my disappointment started to set in.    The problem with this book is that there is absolutely nothing driving the plot forward. Even with the old \\"the murderer is still aboard the train\\" plot-line, Christie manages to make this story as boring as possible. We know, for example, that there is no present danger to any of the current passengers because we learn early on that the murder was for the sake of a very specific revenge. We also learn early on that the murdered man was a despicable and infamous character, so none of the passengers were very distraught over his death (in fact, many of them seemed happy about it). Even the detective, Christie's famous Hercule Poirot, seemed like he was only interested in the case because he had nothing better to do at the time.    To add to this, Christie's writing is tedious. The structure of the novel consists of interview after interview (and even several re-interviews) of every passenger on the coach. There are interesting red-herrings, but they obscure the plot too much and they all seem to only be revealed at the very end (rather than slowly throughout the course of the novel).  I didn't enjoy this book, and, frankly, it makes me want to avoid Agatha Christie's books altogether.
B003VIW8DU|4.0|what a wonderful return to form for Bryan Ferry. using a young guitarist and drummer (his son), he adds several ex-Roxy Music mates and many other luminaries to recreate that Roxy sound better than any record since Avalon. that distinctive voice, the slinky, seductive rhythms, and the timeless, never-say-die romanticism make this music worth listening to many times, both as calmer background sounds and with the earbuds turned up to crankin'. definitely a pleasant surprise.
B001E45XT4|4.0|Pros: This pair of headsets work fine, audio is okay and mike works very well.    Cons: At first the headset seems comfortable enough, however if you are a serious gamer and have the headphones on for extended periods of time. the earcups begin to be hard on the ears, actually causing me a lot of discomfert. I have tried stretching these phones over the computer case to make them as large as possiable, however they continue to squeeze my ears, granted I have a large head size. However I will endure and they will stretch like an old pair of shoes.    They aren't that bad when you consider the price vs performance. For folks with a small to medium head size they probably be a very good purchase.
B002GSXKN8|5.0|These four Batman movies are among the best I've seen.I like Batman Forever the best out of the four films,but all four of them are good and worth watching.I like the first movie with the Joker and the second with the penquin.Though the first two movies aren't appropriate for children,the latter two are more family friendly and have traces of humor as well as action.I loved Jim Carrey with his role as the Riddler and Tommy Lee Jones as Two Face in Forever.Val Kilmer played Wayne in the movie.I best remember him as Jim Morrison in The Doors film.I especially loved Arnold Schwarzennager playing Mr.Fries and George Clooney playing Wayne in Batman and Robin.All Batman fans got to get this DVD package.
B000Q6GX8Q|5.0|This isn't a review of the movie, it's a review of the disk.     This review is for the Blu-ray release, ISBN 1-4198-5312-0. It's a single disk release.    First of all... NO JAVA!!!    This means the disk loads quickly and auto-resume works.    I just compared this with the DVD release. [[ASIN:B002C6A6FY Casablanca (Two-Disc Special Edition)]]. The menus are better implemented and you have more choices in subtitles.    The transfer is super sharp and crisp. They took full advantage of Blu-ray's capabilities. I was hesitant to buy this release as I already owned the DVD. I'm glad I did. The difference between the two is immediately obvious. Don't get me wrong, the DVD is a good release, it's just limited by DVD technology.    Sometimes I'll have both the DVD and Blu-ray version of a movie. In some the special features are implemented better in the DVD. The Patriot is one where this is true. Also I'll often want fast loading or auto-resume.     There are times I've regretted buying a Blu-ray version of a movie I own on DVD. In this case I see no reason to keep my DVD disk. This Blu-ray release is flawless.     Kudos to Warner Brothers.
031286504X|4.0|Solid collection, from the titular novella (very different from the movie, of course, and far more interesting) to the various short stories, all with a strong Twilight Zone vibe. Some of the shorts feel a little dated, especially From Shadowed Places' painful stereotypes, but Matheson is undeniably a top-notch storyteller.
0684833395|5.0|I was supposed to go to Atlanta on a business trip and being tired of flying, I decided to drive and listen to this book on CD.  I really enjoyed the book.  Great story, funny, and thought provoking.  I am looking forward to reading it one more time.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|When I first started reading The Name of the Wind I was utterly surprised to discover this book was actually an autobiography of a fantasy character.  What a wonderfully novel approach to telling a fantasy story.  And what story telling it was!  I was captured by Patrick Rothfuss' writing style quickly and found myself completely identifying with the main character through his many adventures.  The fact that the author was telling me a story was so out of my thought that I was sure I was hearing Kvothe telling *his* story throughout the entire book.  I completely bought into this book on so many levels.  Oh please Mr. Rothfuss rush the next installment to the shelves soon.  My recommendation: a full 5-stars.<br /><br />A small comment regarding some of the other reviews that say this story is a bit slow going for the first hundred pages - nonsense!  Don't listen to the nay-sayers folks, this book is golden from the first page.
B0041CGP02|5.0|For starters, it is a Bon Jovi album, so the odds are in favor of a great album, which is the case with this album.<br /><br />On the other hand, all songs in this compilation are great (besides maybe \\"In These Arms\\").  But, definitely there were some snubs that shouldn't have happened, such as: \\"Misunderstood\\", \\"Welcome To Wherever You Are\\", \\"I Wanna Be Loved\\", \\"Raise Your Hands\\", and \\"Any Other Day\\" (just to mention a few).  Also, there were some songs that, even though they're great (because they are Bon Jovi songs) they didn't necessarily need to be in this compilation, such as: \\"In These Arms\\", \\"Bad Medicine\\", and \\"Lay Your Hands on Me\\".<br /><br />As for the new songs, they're all pretty good.  Some are great, such as \\"What Do You Got?\\" and \\"This is Love This is Life\\"; and others no so much.<br /><br />All in all, a must buy (anyway...).
0307266303|5.0|I came across this book by accident but glad I found it.   Since I enjoy running but not a nut about it, I thought it might inspire me to do more of it.   Sure enough, that it did.   Though it explores a long forgotten, hidden tribe that many should know about it.   It was amazing to learn a little about the history of running and how this hidden tribe thrives on a simple life but one that allows them great health and prosperity.   Give it a try ... I don't think you'll be disappointed.   One additional comment, my 18 year son (not a runner but loves other sports such as soccer), read the book on his Kindle and thoroughly enjoyed it.
B002E9HACG|4.0|From start to finish, this album keeps you rockin'!  The best two tracks are \\"Last Look At Eden\\" and \\"New Love in Town\\".<br /><br />Had the chance to see them live on this tour, and obviously the 2 songs from this album that played live (or at least the two I remember) were \\"Last Look At Eden\\" and \\"New Love in Town\\".
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Lucas could take a hint from his friend Coppala.  The Godfather trilogy on blu-ray with its original theatrical release was not cleaned up, but restored.  Lucas, do a restoration to the original trilogy for us.  A good film to watch in the dark in its original glory.  Part of being in this business is giving your fans and the people what they want.  Cameron did it as well with the Alien release.  Your other friend Steven did it with Encounters of the third kind.  ITS NOT HARD.  Include ALL versions, for everyone.  YOu will make a HUGE amount more money.
1556438850|5.0|Mark Stephens' \\"Teaching Yoga\\" is a must-have book for all yoga teachers and practitioners. The book is well written and organized. It is easy to read (compared with some yoga classics) and is very informative. It is not only a good reference for many common poses (asanas) , it also covers many aspects that advanced students and teachers are interested in: history of yoga, pranayama, bandhas, sequencing, etc.<br /><br />Someone mentioned that Mark uses too many Sanskrit in his book. I must say I disagree! I actually appreciate Mark using Sanskrit name for the asanas as I already know the English names. I want to learn the Sanskrit names as well! As yoga originates from India, it is logical to use Sanskrit terms.<br /><br />Last but not least, Mark is a very detail-oriented and insightful teacher. I found myself re-reading sections of his book and picked up insights that would allow me to become a better, safer practitioner and teacher. I also found the Appendices (the list of asanas and the asana elements) extremely useful for planning a yoga class. I highly recommend this book to anyone who does yoga.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|I knew from the end of season 4 that this season would be awesome. In fact I might dare say it was the best one.<br /><br />The majority of the first three seasons focused on one particular demon and different lore/mythological monsters. I enjoyed watching the writers take on wendingos, jinns, gollums, vampires etc. It was good having stories with a plot within the plot; the main plot being the Winchesters family. Last season ended with Lucifier being set free and the whole time I was on pins and needles. I did not watch this season each week because I did that in season 4 and I almost gave myself a coronary from anticipated excitement, lol.<br /><br />This season starts with boys trying to stop the impending apocalypse. There was some great episodes on this season, far too many to name. Usually I have at least one episode a season that I just cannot get into(ghostfacers) but I loved every one. I want to give extra kudos to the writers for incorporating Odin, my favorite of the Gods in the storyline. That is one of the reason supernatural is so great: it opens up your mind to different culture, provides you with knowledge, and is so freaking entertaining.<br /><br />Once again I loved Micha's Castiel and how he interacted with Dean. The only thing that I truly hated was that both Ellen and Jo had to die. I like seeing \\"all business in the front, party in the back\\" Ash coming back in, as well as how the writers dealt with the Winchester's half brother. Another great thing about supernatural and its writers is they get a lot of things right, the writers do their homework. I will not give much away but this was a really great season. Although I love supernatural, I really do not want to see it go, but I think they should just stop here. Let Dean have \\"some\\" happy ending; he deserves it.
B00005YW4H|3.0|Bottom-Line: Despite the fact that I can only listen to half of \\"Come Away With Me\\" at a time, the album remains in my collection.<br /><br />When Norah Jones burst upon the music scene back in 2002 I didn't quite know what to make of the dark-headed beauty with the slightly unorthodox vocal style.  On the one hand she was--and is--amazingly pleasant to look at, but on the other her voice had--has--a tendency to bore me with prolonged listening.  It's not that her voice isn't pleasant--at first--it's that Norah tends to sing in only one octave, which over time grates on the nerves.<br /><br />This has been a pretty consistent theme on all of her albums, starting with 2002's \\"Come Away With Me\\", released by Blue Notes Records.  \\"Come Away With Me\\" is hard to define musically, but I suppose if I had to classify it I would call it a (at times sensual) cross between traditional soul and folk music.  The album sold a phenomenal 20 million copies worldwide and garnered (6) Grammy Awards, including Best New Artist, for Brooklyn born Jones.<br /><br />Lyrically there is nothing earth shattering new to be found within the words of \\"Come Away With Me\\"; there is nothing be said here that has not been said countless time before, though I will admit sometimes Norah says it a bit differently.  Musically, the album is a good mixture mellow tones that leave a pleasant enough after-taste on my musical pallet.  To her credit Jones plays the piano throughout the CD, though she only wrote two songs on the album: track No. 5 Come Away With Me and track No. 12 Nightingale, and collaborated on one: track No. 13 The Long Day Is Over, which she wrote with Jesse Harris.  Harris also played guitar on the CD and wrote (4) songs: track No. 1 Don't Know Why, track No. 6 Shoot The Moon, track No. 9 I've Got To See You Again, and track No. 11 One Fight Down.<br /><br />Jones sings all of the song is the same laid back, relaxed cadence that lends itself to casual listening.  That is perhaps what endears the artist to so many; the message is her music is light-hearted for the most part, non-threatening, and a-political to say the least.  In other words there is nothing heavy here, just the usual banter about hearts and love; even talk of sex sung in muted phrasing.  No doubt Ms. Jones represents an escape from the frenzied shock-to-the-senses way of life we all seem to be leading.  Norah Jones and her music is the calm in the storm, the oasis in the desert, the sweetness in the salt.<br /><br />I too am swept up in Norah's mellow musical web, at least for a short time.  I still enjoy track No. 1 Come Away With Me, despite its prolonged air play when it was first released as a single.  The message in the music was a bit befuddled, but the overall effect was and is soothing and enjoyable.  The next three tracks do nothing for me really, but track No. 5 Come Away With Me has a simple lyrical beauty that speaks to the poet in me.  Jones paints a wonderful picture of love and human togetherness all wrapped in a sensual vocal delivery that makes my soul smile.<br /><br />Track No. 7 Turn Me On brings a little whimsy and sexual banter to the table.  Sung in the same octave as the rest of the songs on \\"Come Away With Me\\" Jones could have injected a little more sensuality into the number, but alas...from this point I start to lose interest in the album; it takes on a been there, done that tone that leave my mind and soul wanting and wandering in search of an emotional connection.<br /><br />Despite the fact that I can only listen to half of \\"Come Away With Me\\" at a time, the album remains in my collection, because I do enjoy it albeit in small doses.; the message is her music is light-hearted for the most part, non-threatening, and a-political to say the least.

1597801585|3.0|The Windup Girl by Paolo Bacigalupi is a science fiction novel set in a dystopian (and near post-apocalyptic) future.  The world is in meltdown from global warning, the calorie-companies (agri-business megacorps) have released bio-engineered blights and tailored bioweapons to destroy rival crops, there is no more petroleum, it is the age of contraction.    The book is set in Bangkok, Thailand being one of the few countries that has remain outside of the calorie companies' grasp.  Several stories are intertwined: that of Anderson Lake, a calorie man working to find new genetic material for his company.  Emiko, the `windup girl' of the title, one of the genetically constructed Japanese New People, abandoned in Bangkok, she is enslaved and surviving by sex work.  Along with Hock Seng, a Chinese refugee from Malaysia, from where he fled after his family was slaughtered by Muslim extremists.  And Jaidee Rojjanasukchai and Kanya Chirathivat, members of the Thai `White Shirts', agents of the Environmental Ministry tasked with protecting the Kingdom from foreign infestations of all forms.    It is an odd world with carbon rationing (imposed by whom?) yet coal and methane are used for power but primarily it is a world run by transferring human or animal power (calories) into power (joules) used directly or stored in kinksprings.  But there is no sign of biofuels, solar, nuclear, wave or wind power though Chinese hydro-power is mentioned.  It is a world where `gene-ripping' and genetic modification of plants on a massive scale is practiced, the Japanese breed New People to make up for their lack of children, yet the major power for Bangkok is provided by megodonts (genetically modified elephants).  The technologies just do not seem to mesh for me (but that if often a problem I have with post-apocalyptic setting).    The story is interesting switching between multiple viewpoints to move through the plot which blends hunting for new genes, politics, and revolution along with simple survival for some of the characters.  It is well written but by the later section of the book, the characters are being carried along by events and the perspective on what is happening is very limited, much of the action taking place off stage, which may be accurate of how such things play out but it is not very satisfying.             Ultimately though, the central background villains of the piece, the calorie companies, are simply unbelievable.  Yes, megacorps tend to get away with what they can, but if one of them started releasing bioweapons, even ones that targeted crops, their leadership would be up against the wall in record time.  Some things are just not tolerated.  While it makes for an interesting world, it does not ring true.      The world of the Windup Girl does provide interesting inspiration for near future gaming, it is an almost post-apocalyptic world with Japan seeming to be a near-cyberpunk haven among the wreckage of the contraction.  Calorie companies playing genetic chess with bioweapons and countermeasures, each side generipping to try and get ahead of the other.  The possibilities for a genepunk (for lack of a better name) games are endless.    One last comment/warning, the scenes of Emiko's degradation at the hands of her fellow sex workers and clients make for brutal reading.
B002ONC9NC|2.0|Bottom-Line:  \\"An Education,\\" is empty, vapid, detached, tedious, and in the end totally pointless.<br /><br />Every once and a while a true talent steps onto the worlds' acting stage, someone who bears watching and indeed is a pleasure to watch no matter what vehicle may showcase their talents. Such is the case with British-born, 24-year old actress Carey Mulligan who took top billing in last years \\"An Education (2010),\\" also starting Peter Sarsgaard.<br /><br />The Story<br /><br />Directed by Lone Scherfig (Wilbur, Red Road, Just Like Home), \\"An Education\\" takes place is London in the early 1960's. Carey Mulligan (Pride & Prejudice, Never Let Me Go, Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps) portrays Jenny a sixteen year old girl from a middle-class family striving to get into Oxford University.  She is helped along in this regard by her father Jack (Alfred Molina ~ Spider-Man 2, Silk, Frida), and mother Marjorie (Cara Seymour ~ American Psycho, Gangs of New York, Adaptation).<br /><br />One rainy day after cello practice as she is standing in a downpour waiting for(?), David, portrayed by Peter Saragaard ~ Jarhead, Boys Don't Cry, Flightplan) happens by with a delightful little car and offers Jenny a ride. At first she is reluctant, after all David is roughly twice her age, but eventually she relents, worn down by his considerable charm.  Afterwards, David, with the consent of Jenny's parents starts to show her that there are other things in life other than school and study.<br /><br />David introduces Jenny to his running mates Danny (Dominic Cooper ~ The Duchess, Mamma Mia, The History Boys) and Helen (Roseamund Pike ~ Pride & Prejudice, Die Another Day, Fracture) and together the four start to live the high life and educating Jenny.<br /><br />My Thoughts<br /><br />\\"An Education\\" is a bore! This reviewer hardly knows where to begin complaining about this movie it is largely emotionless, mundane, sexless, and belonged on Lifetime Television, not on the big screen.  And there were considerable problems with the script.  First, what self-respecting parents would let their 16-year old daughter spend afternoons and evenings, let alone weekends away with a grown man twice her age?  Seriously?  In fact everyone in this deflated little tale is made to look like a clown in order to make Jenny, the protagonist appear worldlier than her 16 years would otherwise suggest.<br /><br />And where was the romance in this little farce?  David is charming, and it's easy to understand how a girl of Jenny's naivet&eacute; could fall under his spell, but he is never overly romantic towards Jenny.  There were no stolen kisses, no long, lingering glances, no hand holding, waist hugging, face stroking, no caresses, no poetry laced words.  There is no attempt made to make Jenny fall in love with David, to see him as anything more than a friend introducing her to Jazz and fine art, but suddenly he's asking to see her breasts, and this is before the first kiss; The Graduate (1967), \\"An Education\\" isn't, the movie lacks the passion, titillation, emotional depth, and drama of that classic coming-of-age story.<br /><br />Yes, David eventually deflowers Jenny, but we are not witness to the event; it happens and the two (alleged) lovers discuss the matter afterward--fully clothed--as if they were discussing what to order from room service!<br /><br />Mulligan, who could be Katie Holmes' younger sister, gives the only (partially) nuanced and emotionally compelling performance in the movie.  And though she is interesting and engaging to watch, even she could not elevation, and or transform, \\"An Education\\" into something I could recommend with a straight face.  Mulligan is just a momentary distraction (albeit a damn adorable one) from the inconsistencies and incongruities so inherent in the other characters.<br /><br />And as the end plays out Jenny finds evidence that David isn't what he holds himself out to be all too conveniently, and as it turns out stupidly, for David is not beginner at this sort of behavior.  But, Jenny's discovery leads us nowhere; there is no dramatic flourish, no emotional or physical explosion; there is nothing and that is the problem with \\"An Education,\\" the movie is empty, vapid, detached, tedious, and in the end totally pointless.behavior.

B00018D44U|3.0|When Norah Jones burst upon the music scene back in 2002 I didn't quite know what to make of the dark-headed beauty with the slightly unorthodox vocal style and the sultry disposition.  Like I stated in my review of her debut album, Come Away With Me: \\"[O]n the one hand she was--and is--amazingly pleasant to look at, but on the other her voice had--has--a tendency to bore me with prolonged listening.  It's not that her voice isn't pleasant--at first--it's that Norah tends to sing in only one octave, which over time grates on the nerves.\\"<br /><br />This has been a pretty consistent theme on all of her albums, starting with 2002's Come Away With Me, released by Blue Notes Records and it continued on her follow up CD \\"Feels Like Home (2004).\\"  Stylistically \\"Feels Like Home\\" does not stray too far afield from the sound that made Ms. Jones' first album such a run-a-way hit.  The music is still hard to musically define, but I suppose if I had to classify it I would call it a (at times sensual) cross between traditional soul and folk music, only this time around I can hear more than a few hints of C&W in the melody and lyrics.  The appearance of Country & Western siren Dolly Parton on track No. 7 Creepin' In only buttresses this aura perception.<br /><br />Like the album that preceded it \\"Feels Like Home\\" was an instant hit; the album went platinum the very first week of its release, but it ultimately under-performed Ms. Jones debut album, with just 4 million copies sold thus far.  And while the album did not win any awards, the single Sunrise (track No. 1) netted Ms. Jones a Grammy Award in 2005 for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance.<br /><br />After listening to \\"Feels Like Home\\" more than a few times through I have to admit that it is a little more interesting than the Brooklyn born artists' first offering.  Lyrically, the album is a little more polished, a little more musically attractive so to speak.<br /><br />Musically, the album is once again a good mixture mellow tones that leave a pleasant enough after-taste on my musical pallet.  To her credit Jones plays the piano throughout the CD, and did write or co-write (6) of the 13 tracks on the album, including track No. 1 Sunrise and one of my favorites Toes (Track No. 8).<br /><br />Special guests include the aforementioned country stable Dolly Parton, jazz drummer Brian Blade, as-well-as Levon Helm and Garth Hudson of the Band. Song writing partners include Lee Alexander (Sunrise, Carnival Town, Toes, and the Prettiest Thing).  Guest lyrists include Tom Waits (The Long Way Home), and Lee Alexander (Creepin' In). and there are surprises as well in the guise of Ms. Jones's retooling of Duke Ellington's Melancholia, re-titled \\"Don't Miss You at All, on Feels Like Home.<br /><br />Not unlike Come Away With Me, Jones sings all of the songs on this CD in the same laid back, relaxed cadence that lends itself to casual listening.  That is perhaps what endears the artist to so many listeners; the message is her music is light-hearted for the most part, non-threatening, and a-political to say the least.  In other words there is nothing heavy here, just the usual banter about hearts and love.  No doubt Ms. Jones represents an escape from the frenzied shock-to-the-senses way of life we all seem to be leading.  Norah Jones and her music is the calm in the storm, the oasis in the desert, the sweetness in the salt.<br /><br />I too can be swept up in Norah's mellow musical web, at least for a short time.  But t I have to admit, it took a little longer for to get bored with the offerings on \\"Feels Like Home.\\"  I enjoyed the opening track Sunshine and tracks in between until just after track No.8 Toes.  The message in most of the music remains a bit befuddled, but the overall effect was and is still soothing and enjoyable.<br /><br />The next three tracks do nothing for me really, but track No. 9 Humble Me has a beautiful musical underpinning in to form of a lone rhythm guitar.  And though Iam a fan of Tom Waits music, I did not take to The Long Way Home.  Perhaps in another's voice box the song would sound markedly different, but Ms. Jones does it little justice.<br /><br />The last track Don't Miss You At All is slightly retooled version of a Duke Ellington classic.  One review I have read of this CD, states that Jones' rendition of this song was \\"soul-stirring,\\" hardy!  Norah Jones' music can be called many things; soul-stirring is not one of them, at least most of the time.  She delivers the song to us in the same monotone in which she delivers all of her songs, my soul was not stirred in the least; there was no emotion there, not soul.<br /><br />Despite the fact that I can only listen to slightly over half of \\"Feels Like Home\\" at a time, the album remains in my collection, because I have to admit, that bit by musical bit Norah Jones is growing on me.ong Way Home.

B003SNJYSK|3.0|In a few rapid-fire opening pages the Norwegian cop with the bad personal habits and the absolute crummiest name in the gumshoe-thriller genre, Harry Hole, screws up and shoots a U. S. Secret Service Agent in the back while working a security detail covering a 1999 U.S. presidential visit to Norway. As a result, Hole gets himself promoted to inspector in the Oslo Security Service. Go figure.<br /><br />That's the prologue. And that's how events and circumstances don't often turn out as expected in a Jo Nesbo crime stopper involving the tall, newly appointed inspector with the close-cropped hair, black jeans and hi-top Doc. Martens.<br /><br />This time around Hole goes against a group of skinheads and aging Norwegian nationals with WWII Nazi connections. The story begins more than half a century earlier at the end of the war on the cold, wintry Eastern Front where a band of Norwegian anti-Russians has enlisted as Hitler's foot soldiers on a fool's errand combating the Bolsheviks.<br /><br />The psychic and physical wounds from 1944 are carried forward into the present and to Oslo where they lead to a May 17 Norwegian Independence Day assassination plot that Hole is wise to and is doggedly trying to derail.<br /><br />The story threads back and forth between the German front in the waning days of the war and present-day Oslo. Norwegian national sympathies, lingering Nazi influences and the country's current culture as well as political issues and prejudices are woven tightly into a densely textured broadcloth of a story, rich in detail and very good in creating a vivid sense of time and place.<br /><br />Harry Hole should meet up with Lee Child's Jack Reacher or Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch. They probably couldn't stand each other's company but they do share the same directness of purpose and sense of resolve that doesn't leave much room for fear or indecision. Hole, unlike Bosch and Reacher, is more of a pushover when it comes to women, when emotion and impulsiveness appear to trump reason and rational action.<br /><br />The novel follows a full truckload of characters, so many that I started a crib sheet on my K3 in a somewhat hapless attempt to keep them straight. Nesbo seems to want to keep the reader off balance and build intrigue by continually entwining his characters and mixing up the cast. As a plot device, he unexpectedly kills off a major player, who is on the good side, and not all the bad guys get their just punishment. He plays with names, family relationships, shifts identities and splits one of the key antagonists into dual personalities.

B002LC8HF0|5.0|Every once in awhile I read a fantasy series that broadens my concept of what a fantasy book can do. Lord of the Rings, A Song of Ice and Fire, Mistborn. Brandon Sanderson's coup de grace on the Mistborn saga is truly a work of art. Pulling together so many threads into a cohesive and well-designed finale took a vision and literary beauty that left me smiling, cheering and shaking my head in wonder at various times.<br /><br />The plot of Mistborn is so far-reaching, and so well-constructed, that at times I felt humbled by the man who could imagine such a world. Sanderson creates a vision of Allomancy and warring gods, then shatters that world into a thousand pieces, then reconstructs the entire thing in a completely new way. And he does it without leaving a single piece unfinished or a single question unanswered.<br /><br />The characters in Mistborn aren't real people and you can't identify with them. I think for many this is a point of criticism, but I see it as Sanderson making a point about good and evil. His characters are frequently internally conflicted about what the moral thing to do is, without being conflicted about whether or not they should be moral. Are people really that simple? No. Can we learn a bit about ourselves from this? Absolutely.<br /><br />If you're looking for visceral and real characters and interactions, look elsewhere. This book is a pure fantasy in every aspect, and it makes no apologies for it. If you suspend your disbelief and let Sanderson's wonderful powers of description and plot construction take you on a journey, you won't be disappointed.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I would absolutely recommend this workout to anyone! I'm in good shape, and even level 1 on the DVD had me breathing heavy, and left my muscles sore. I've been doing level 1 for 5 days so far, and I am already seeing my muscles become more toned. It's also great that Jillian \\"modifies\\" the workout for those who need it.

B0034G4P7G|4.0|The Social Network is not the Godfather of this generation as many critics have suggested, but it's a very well scripted and acted near masterpiece, detailing the roots of the online culture we now live in. I had avoided seeing it in theaters mainly due to the subject matter, which I really couldn't care less about, but the rise and fall of the creators of Facebook was more fascinating than I had originally thought it would be. Plus, finding out that David Fincher was behind the camera also got my attention. It's sure to take home a couple of Oscars and maybe even the biggest one. I think it was a bit too hyped and not the best movie of year, but it did make my top 10 of 2010. So go ahead. Yes, that's it. Log off of Facebook and take the time to check it out.

I have to say though, I would probably still pay 19.99 for the e-copy of it because it was just that good!
B003ES61EE|5.0|I received this lens pen almost 2 days after purchasing a different model on Amazon so if have a direct opinion of both.  I'll stick to the Amazon Pen in this review.  The Amazon Basics lens pen came packaged so heavily in cardboard that you may have expected the tool to be made of glass and not the plastic that it is.  It was way overkill in packaging, when a simple sleeve would have sufficed.<br /><br />It operates like most lens pens with an effective retractable dust brush and a smudge tip.  What made this pen differnt than its competitors was the differnt tips on the smudge side.  You have an option of a pointy or flat tip, by flipping the point.  This was a nice option and a definite value add.<br /><br />It does what it is intended and its in a format that's easy to carry in your pocket or in a bag sleve. When on a zoo trip or walking around photos when you're not interested in carrying a full kit, this is a simple tool to deal with artifacts.

1594202842|1.0|Having read both the Wall Street Journal excerpt under a dubious title and having preordered this book myself, I have had quite a few discussions with my friends and family members regarding this book. Some people support Amy Chua's (actually Cai) parenting methods wholeheartedly while others do not. Having been the product of such parenting and as a \\"failure\\" by these \\"Chinese\\" standards, I have much to say. This book was written in a very jumbled, reminiscent, and jarring manner to get people to discuss how to best raise their children, Chinese or other nationalities. I think the title of the book clearly shows that Amy Cai's method and process should still be considered worth keeping, even in such a interconnected, increasingly tolerant, and disruptive world. This method of parenting is very close to dictatorships in the past or oppressive parties in how they impose their will upon others. This book may have been a last ditch attempt to resurrect the hands on, suffocating, coercive, and never ending demands style of parenting that some Chinese parents (not all) have done at some point in time. Sure the parent pours all their heart and soul in raising a child that will not be a failure; this means Harvard admissions, straight A's, six figure salary, and a professor, doctor, and lawyer. Most children do not share the experiences of their parents (coming from another country, struggling with racism and bamboo ceilings) so they do not understand why their parents drive them so hard. The biggest problem is that most kids need to explore and understand for themselves what is truly important in their lives. Not every child will grow being a happy professor, doctor, and lawyer and then go to their parents and saying, \\"Thanks mom and dad for driving so hard to achieve these goals\\" and this why some people, too depressed from these type of parenting, end up committing suicide or losing motivation to drive him or herself forward because they did not develop their own capability to drive themselves. I think this book also shows the narrow train of thought most Chinese people have in terms of success, happiness, and what's best for their children. Pretty much anything that is hard to attain, mostly driven by numbers such as GMAT, MCAT, GRE, SAT scores and G.P.A's and has a well known title for society in general - doctor, professor, judge - are considered prestigious and the only fields worth going into. The whole craze into both violin and piano is that these instruments show a disciplined, cultured mind. The really sad part is that because everybody else plays violin or piano, this makes playing violin and piano very common and not very distinctive when applying to colleges, music schools, and graduate schools. I would even go as far to say that drums and harp players have a better shot at getting in orchestras and wherever they want in life than piano and violin players. The whole emphasis throughout this book on prestigious piano competitions, violin performances, and other items of prestige does not necessary make a person happier because he/she feels that her free time was robbed for something she does not consider as important as what the parents considered. Not every teenager will appreciate the prestige or consider it important because they have their lives to build up and attend to.    Lost amidst all these discussion about the merits of this book as well as the criticisms is the fact of the matter that there is no easy, one shot way to raise a child to be a successful one, be it the \\"western\\" method or the \\"Chinese\\" method. The problem is, nobody has yet to come up with a even better way that either incorporates the best of both worlds or innovative enough to equip the child to be successful and self motivated on his/her own so the child can decide and live the life he/she wants. If people think the \\"Chinese\\" method can create another Warren Buffett, Bill Gates, Peter Drucker, Albert Einstein, Ludwig van Beethoven or anothervisionary person who all of history will celebrate for ages then they are gravely mistaken. From my experience, the \\"Chinese\\" method of childrearing only worked for the first 18 years or so, then everything fell apart with myself suffering a period of hopelessness and despair. I also went through a period of rebellion and disappointment with regards to what I had been through during my childhood. From my own experience, it was when I realized that there is something I could do that can allow me to move on with life and driving myself much harder (it felt much easier too since nobody could do it except myself) than my parents could ever force upon me was I able to get out from those dark years of life. Although the book does a decent, albeit ruffled job of describing all the events that happened. This book's far reaching impact of promoting or resurrecting a dying way of parenting is what I cannot agree with. This book was written like a blog and has a very sinister and subtle message of saying that a partially unsuccessful method parenting works in such a changing, dynamic world in which we all live in.

B002ZG981E|2.0|I generally like sci-fi.  And I'm usually okay if everything isn't wrapped up in a neat bow (Why does the crew of Serenity wear futuristic cowboy gear? It's not really explained, but I'll go with it).   But I think Nolan intentionally uses artificial constructs to make his movies bizarre and/or difficult to follow.  This is somehow interpreted as \\"creativity.\\"  Nolan's \\"Memento\\" was really just a murder mystery.  If the main character didn't have a weird memory problem so that the story is told backward, there would be nothing particularly interesting about the movie.  Again, other than great visual effects, there really isn't much to \\"Inception.\\" Like \\"Memento,\\" the story is saddled with some bizarre constructs (e.g., if you die in the first level of a dream, you wake up; if you die in the second level of a dream, you go to limbo).  From the viewer's standpoint, the only object of the movie is to try and figure out whether your're watching a dream or watching reality.  And \\"Inception\\" tries its best to make that job very difficult... Of note, the \\"architect\\" of the dream is asked to create a dream world that does NOT accurately reflect reality (maybe just a few street signs) so that the architect doesn't get confused between what is a dream and what is reality.  Well, someone might want to tell Nolan that dreams don't really have to look like video games.  And why do the characters in the dream need to drive in a car?  Why not just fly like a bird?  Or just appear / disappear?  One of the weirdest scenes of the movie is when one of the characters tells another to dream \\"bigger\\" and substitutes a bazooka-type rifle for a smaller gun.  Instead, why couldn't the character just hurl some sort of X-Men explosive device from his mouth?  I'll tell you why.  Because then you (the viewer) would know that you're watching a dream.

B003UYUR0G|5.0|How can a regular person not enjoy this movie? Indeed this is not the kind of movie that you search your heart and soul to find the truth of life. Neither will this movie touch you so deeply that you need a tissue to cry your heart out. Nevertheless, it has a simple yet colorful storyline, a handsome witty prince that portrays family values, a beautiful princess conveys noble causes, eloquent and elegant dialogues that bring you sorrow and laughter, and excellent cinematography that truthfully brings audience to the far exotic land of time. You gradually fall in love with the prince and princess as their mutual admiration develops. There is only one kiss in the movie, and yet that is all required to present love. There is no need to over-analyze the story. Let yourself go and immerse in the movie. Discover the destiny! Jake Gyllenhaal's acting is especially noted and highly recommended; he has come a long way. If you can, get the blu-ray version. It is wonderfully transcribed and all the details can be amazingly seen! This is one of very few movies that are of great entertaining value. Try it!
0767817664|3.0|Horror movies are not really my thing, but this movie kept my attention and was pretty entertaining for the most part. Of course it's an older movie so don't expect a lot of special effects or anything. I like older movies (by older I mean 1980's), but if you don't happen to like older movies then maybe this wouldn't be a good choice for you.  I personally remember being scared out of my mind from some other 1980's movies like Friday the 13th and especially Nightmare on Elm Street, but for some reason this one wasn't like that for me. So, overall it was pretty entertaining, but, not that scary.
B000VMFDW2|4.0|As a narrative piece on the daily life of a marine foot-solider in the Pacific in WWII, this contribution by E.B. Sledge is unparalleled.

One is left with the senselessness and futility of war, with so many lives blown into oblivion fighting for their country.<br /><br />As this account is told from the perspective of an enlisted mortarman, I found that you never fully saw the bigger picture - often times the author would be supporting the advance with mortars from the rear, and would only find out what happened second hand when the fighting was over.  Being a junior rank as well, he was never privvy to the strategy and macro view of the actions the company was taking part in - time and time again, they just did what they were told by their NCOs as they moved from one place to another.<br /><br />That said, you will find details mentioned in the book that are often omitted from other historical accounts that paint broader strokes.  The writing is rich in detail, unassuming presented with no pretense and one can't help but be drawn into world of the author.
B002SJKWZ4|1.0|My wife was not pleased at all with this product. Well, she said it looks good but it does not work with our TV/cable system.  Perhaps if we used only the TV it would work but it is not compatable with our cable box, etc.
1594202842|3.0|As a Chinese Singaporean and a mom, I wonder how Amy can claim to be \\"Chinese\\" in her methods and successful at parenting. In my eyes, she is pretty westernised, having lived most of her life in Philippines and the US and having a western husband. Even in Singapore where the majority are Chinese, we as Chinese wonder often about our own Chineseness. Our grandparents were raised in confucian China but during that period of time, China underwent enormous upheaval and changes. Communist ethos were championed at the expense of confucian values. It's really odd that she claims to be so Chinese. I think her style of parenting is perhaps driven by fear, being a minority in a western country.     Aa a mom, I think she seriously underperformed. Since she claims to be performance driven then I think the word \\"underperform\\" will seriously rile her. Discipline and love for the chosen subject (and the parent) is not mutually exclusive. That her second child had so detested the piano meant that she was lazy and ineffective as a parent. My own child has piano lessons. While we do have a set time for practice, I take great pains to instil a love of the instrument. This is much harder than insulting and forcing the child. It is a lot of work on my part. When my daughter was learning to play a waltz, I went on youtube to learn the waltz with her. We had a blast waltzing across the room and she felt challenged to play the piece at a much faster pace so she could have her mom dance silly. Since my daughter enjoyed the process, it took half the time to master the piece. I am quite surprised that as a Yale professor, she had been so ineffective in parenting and quite misguided about her own hard work. I think she lacked foresight and was really lazy!    Amy's methods are really old-fashion. There has been a great deal of interest on Confucian societies aceing scores but it is a gross generalization to assume it was all due to tiger moms. Children in Asia, like their counterparts in the West, are rebellous too. We do put much emphasis on scores but the methods have changed to engage and challenge the child.
B000PDYVVG|5.0|I absolutely loved this book and highly recommend it if you love eating, travelling, being spiritual and falling in love :)
0525951652|5.0|I throughly enjoyed this book. If you loved Pillars of the Earth, you will love Fall of Giants even more. This book is Classic Follett. You get to know all the characters and befriend them. You learn through the eyes of the characters, life during World War One from different prespectives. From the rich, poor, Allied side, and German Side.   A Must Read!!!
B003VPWXRO|5.0|I first discovered Portia de Rossi as Nelle Porter in Ally McBeal and then, of course, heard of her again as she became the girlfriend and now wife of Ellen DeGeneres. For some reason, I liked her right away and, even though I don't know her on a personal level, thought she was an intriguing person with surely an interesting story. I was right. But what a story ! A victim of anorexia, a victim of perfectionism, a victim of her own homosexuality for the longest time, too, Portia de Rossi reveals herself in the most genuine and sometimes heartbreaking way. She writes beautifully (being an actress doesn't make you a writer) and dares to undress her soul completely to show us the ugly truth of it all : fame, so-called \\"beauty\\" and the supposed happiness it brings you.
B000WGWQG8|4.0|We're only through the 1st two espisodes but are loving it.  Now that we've discovered how to display the historic notation subtitles it's even more interesting.  They don't interfere at all and provide important historical facts.  Our rating is 4 instead of 5 only because this is a used set and one of the  disc holders is broken so the disc isn't secure in its case.   The discs themselves are in perfect condition.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|Everything has already been said about this absolutely amazing book which completely deserves all of the success it has already received and will keep on receiving for the longest time.

B003VS0CWO|2.0|The video portion of this blu-ray edition was gorgeous but the audio made it almost unwatchable.  The music and musical numbers were much louder than the dialogue.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This was the first book I got for my Kindle and I absolutly LOVED it! It was one of those books that you don't want to finish so it never ends. The fact that it is narrated by Death doesn't make it scary at all. If anything the charecter adds just the right amount of humor and things to think about. I will definitely be reading it again!
B002Y074BW|2.0|I love The Vampire Diaries tv show but the Ubox is very annoying. When I bought this offline it said that I would be able to do what ever I wanted with it. But Iv tried and tried to download it onto and ipod and things like that but it will not let me. It makes me very mad!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0037UUZQY|4.0|My granddaughter loved the Rapunzel doll, Tangled, which I got her for Christmas. It is a pretty doll and well made.  She plays with it a lot.  The only problem with it is the hair attachment that comes with it.  It is not enough to attach and doesn't really look like hair.  Needs to be made thicker and able to be attached  better.
B001HN694K|5.0|I had absolutely no idea Alice in Wonderland was so... dark, twisted, highly unusual and hypnotically colorful, haha.    You see I never actually watched the original animated version because I was under the impression this was a Disney film intended exclusively for *girls* so I completely avoided it for years.  A blonde-haired little girl stumbles across a bizarre fantasy land, makes friends with many of the people, and instantly changes into a much bigger giant girl simply by drinking or eating something magical?  Yeah... not exactly what I would have considered a *cool* movie.      Well, that all changed last night.  Hey, anything with Johnny Depp must be at least decent, right?  Well yeah... but it deserves a higher compliment than being tagged as simply \\"decent\\".  It's a really exciting adventure that's honestly a bit darker and more complex than I originally thought...    That is, assuming this movie is exactly how the animated version goes storyline-wise.  I have no idea how different it really is to that (or any other generally accepted *official* version).    The only thing I really know is that the animations and many unusual effects featured in this particular version of the popular childrens story are extremely psychadelically enchantingly... bizarre, haha.  No other possible way for me to describe its many vibrant layers of eye candy.    I know one thing for sure- most of the characters are downright uniquely strange or ugly.  Talking soldier frogs?  A cat with magical disappearing abilities?  A queen that's unbearably unattractive?  A beautiful exceptionally white angel creature?  Two chubby vulnerable twin boys?  An oranged-haired joker... whatever he is (Depp's character).  A bloodhound that talks?  Oh, and who can possibly forget the extremely awesome demonic creature that just appears out of nowhere and attacks the good people of the land?  That is one really dark moment of fairy tale storytelling, and I won't dare spoil his reason for existing orwhat happens.    Hmmm, now I really have to sit and wonder just what kind of person this film was intended for all along.   Children?  Well I suppose it would HAVE to be a childrens movie.  Whatever the case- the delicious smell of fabric softener coming through my living room vents from the dryer and washing machine in the basement below is making me feel really fruity and happy.  Maybe NOW is a good time to give Alice in Wonderland another shot and appreciate it in the way originally intended.  Here we go!
B0000DZ3EN|5.0|This is a very good movie for both adults and kids to enjoy.  I've seen it several times as a child and as an adult and it is one of those movies that never gets tiring.  I'm a big fan of the Judy Garland \\"Wizard of Oz\\" and in my opinion \\"Return to Oz\\" doesn't demean or take anything away from that great movie; so viewers who are reluctant to see it for that reason can lay their fear aside and sit down to enjoy another really great movie.
B002OEBMN4|1.0|this is their worst record.it sounds like contract filler,even the title is cheezie and the production sounds like that overcompression tactic that others are using to hide their lack of talent.i like everything slayer has done but this record is not one of them.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|My family saw this movie in 3-D in the theater and it was much better than I expected.  It was silly, but very sweet, moving and engaging.  Fun for the whole family.
B000FCJZ4K|4.0|I have been through a few networking books now, but got this one from the library ( along with library cd's), and decided I had to own it.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|My daughter asked for this video for Christmas and I was happy to oblige.  It is a fun and entertaining movie that never gets old.  The songs are fun and the message that you need to look with your heart, not just with your eyes is timeless.
1439153663|5.0|I can't express how much I appreciate this author's successful attempt to give voices to the enslaved Africans-African Americans, of our history.  It took bravery, and an extremely open mind to allow them to tell of their horrors, as well as the lives they were able to create for themselves, often risking life and limb to do so.  The one theme that struck me the hardest, was the constant, heart wrenching separation of parent and child, husband and wife, sister and brother.   Any parent knows the fear involved in simply imagining losing a child, and for enslaved people, the fear was constant.   Thanks to the author for allowing them to reach across the centuries and remind us that thousands of Africans paid a high price to help build America, and bring meaning to our belief in  freedom for all.
160094048X|5.0|This book is full of tried and true classics like chocolate chip cookies, chocolate crackles, shortbread, brownies, magic cookie bars, and etc. It also contains some out of the ordinary recipes like spiced sweet potato blondies, sweet wine biscuits with sesame, and green tea walnut biscotti. Overall the recipes are not healthy as they call for lots of sugar and chocolate. This is a cookie book. It is not meant to be healthy, it is meant to be delicious. It's not entirely sinful, there are a few \\"wholesome\\" recipes too. This book is not for the strict vegan trying to eliminate sugar, chocolate and white flour. It is a book for vegans who crave a \\"real\\" sweet treat once in a while.     So far I have tried two recipes, the brownies and the cowboy cookies. Both were excellent, however, the cowboy cookies are my favorite. You honestly cannot tell they are vegan. The combination of toasted pecans, coconut, and chocolate is amazing.There is also an option to make them with cranberries, white chocolate, and walnuts-I bet that would be great.  I have served both of the recipes to non-vegans and they were a big hit.  I look forward to trying more of the recipes in the book, however my husband and I have greatly reduced the amount of sugar in our diet, so I am only baking every once in a while. So it will take me a while to make it through the book. As I try new recipes I will update my review.     Happy Baking. :-)
B00428CPUY|4.0|A great collection of blues tunes. The 2nd DVD really stands out since I am a huge fan of Derek Trucks and Warren Haynes. Got see some other fantastic guitar players I was unfamiliar with such as Sonny Landreth(sp) as well.
B000OPPBEQ|4.0|My husband was so excited when I bought this for him. It has all these extras that I didn't even know about. My only complaint would be that the cover started to come apart after only a few days, I just glued it and now it looks perfect again.
B00009XITQ|5.0|This movie was very funny as well as having a lot of heart. It also shows that we all have to make choises, making them with the heart is not as simple as it seems. I enjoyed the contest betwee the snobs and the just plain folks. love thei movie and recommened it to all ages.
0783225857|5.0|It was very easy to order and I received it in plenty of time before Christmas. The DVD was in excellent condition. This is my second year of ordering from Amazon and can always count on getting what I need, when I need it. They have always been for gifts and everyone is always happy with what they get. I highly recommend using them.Thanks Amazon.
B0040UAYI4|3.0|I never would have purchased this item if not for an injury to my radial nerve which greatly affected the use of my right hand/wrist.  I still have difficulty moving the mouse with accuracy, but am able to manage.    As far as the device itself, it seems to work pretty much as advertised.  It's kind of hard to judge completely as my hand/wrist movements remain somewhat coarse.  Unlike other available devices which from what I can tell have little/no customer support, Penguin United at least has a forum in which they appear to be active in.  I would recommend visiting their site before purchase to fully understand set up as it is somewhat involved in getting the device to work at its best.    I have no regrets in purchasing this item and am looking forward to continued use as my hand function returns.  I did rate this conservatively as I am not able to fully test it.  It works well, especially for the amount invested.  In summary, I recommend this item.
0307591549|5.0|I learned a lot from this book.   I just finished the audio version of it, and I am now purchasing the book so I can underline passages and share them with my daughter.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Came way earlier than it said it would be. So we opened that movie and all of us got together and watched it the same day. Thank you for a great movie and a great family night.
1599218011|5.0|I've been anticipating this book release for awhile now, and as soon as I found it on Amazon I had it overnighted to my doorstep. Kris Carr has put years of research into this book and it shows. I highly recommend it to.... everyone! There isn't anyone who wouldn't benefit from the information in this book.   Whatever you may be tied down to- maybe you want to lose a few pounds, have more energy, better skin, maybe you want to feel more in control of your emotions. Maybe you have more serious issues like digestive problems, allergies, arthritis, or even more serious disease. Whatever you are facing, the best place to start is by treating your body like the temple it is, and only putting good things into it.   Kris will walk you through it step by step, and you will feel like a million dollars!   If you do one thing for YOURSELF in 2011, it should be to BUY THIS BOOK!
0061906220|5.0|I working as a Lead Teacher in a Child Development Center in a Preschool (3 and 4 years old) classroom.  I was doing my weekly lesson plan on having a \\"sense of self\\"...and I saw this book and thought it would be a cute little read for the kids that has a good moral to the story.  I never expected it to be such a huge hit with all my kids.  They ask me to read it every day...and most of them know the entire story by heart because we read it so often...I would highly recommend this book to anyone!!
B001QXCYZY|4.0|For the price, the Behringer C1-U is pretty much a steal for the buck. Its as simple as plugging it in the PC and start using it right away. I love the fact that its software is compatible with both Mac and PC so choices are not limited to this mic. I love the crisp sound as I used it to sing a cover on the PC. If you are a vocalist or just needs a mic that is set to detail this is the mic to go. Though I wish they did come with a case but overall its a good condensor mic for about 50 bucks. Pretty solid body too. I recommend this to the people. Believe you will love it too
030746363X|5.0|This book is amazing! I got it for myself, but one of my daughters started reading it and has started to implement its practices with great success. That's never happened with her before. Kudos!!!!
B0001WTWCO|5.0|Rather than explain why I love this movie, I'll just write that this kind of movie needs to be watched more than once in order to \\"get\\" all of it. It's a complex story that weaves together brilliantly, but can be a little confusing on the first run-through.  If those who hated the movie would just watch it again, I bet many would like it a lot more.
1599218011|5.0|This is so much more than a diet book!   I have never been inspired to change my life like I have by Kris Carr's \\"Crazy Sexy Diet\\" book.    Kris writes as if she's your best friend and loves you most in the world.  Every question is answered....even the ones I didn't think I wanted to know (see Chapter 5)!    This information packed book has everything you need to take control of your health and your life, and does it in a way that gets you excited about your life's potential.  Even if you take just one small part of Kris's advice and put it into practice, you'll have taken a huge step toward a sexier, healthier lifestyle.       Simply put, I am talking about this book to all my friends and family, and I'm buying it for the people that I love.
B004GNYGTI|4.0|I'm not sure what I was expecting, but this was an entertaining spy/action film.  The movie has a plot that comes from an angle that threw me for a bit.  Lots of turns and twists, and action that keeps it moving along at a frantic pace.  I enjoyed it.
B002UXRH10|3.0|I love Rihanna's music and style and think she's super talented. Rated R is the first album of hers I ever brought and I'm happy I did. This is probably one of her most personal albums seeing as how it came out after the whole Chris Brown incident. Some of my favorite songs are: ''Rudeboy'', ''Hard'', ''Rockstar 101'', and ''Wait Your Turn''. But the best songs and ones I most enjoyed are ''Cold Case of Love'' and ''Fire Bomb''. They should of been singles. Those are hands down two of the best songs she ever made and it sucks most people have never heard them.<br /><br />While I did enjoy this album, some songs didn't do it for me. on ''G4L'' she was going for a more gangsta sound and feel but it didn't come off authentic. Also ''Photographs'' and ''The Last Song'' bore me and both should of been left off the album. And the lyrics to ''Stupid in Love'' are cringe worthy. I mean who's idea was '' I may be dumb but, I'm not stupid in love''??? Just terrible. ''Te Amo'' isn't bad but I can take it or leave it.<br /><br />Anyway, if you are just starting to get into Rihanna's music, this is the album to start with. You will enjoy it.
1932100660|5.0|This book is beautifully written and researched. It is clear that for the health of this country we should help virtually all citizens  become whole grain, plant-based eaters. I did and am losing weight and feel great. For those with heart disease, read 'Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease' by Esselstyn - fantastic!!!!!
0811806405|3.0|This is a fine book on guitar building (a little dated).  It has lots of detail and is broken into logical and digestible chapters.  My only complaint is all the pictures are black and white.  While still good I think color photos would have been better.
B000TLMWMY|5.0|I'd only heard about the Johnny Cash TV Show in books so I was eager to find out what it was about and I certainly was not disappointed. What a great cast of artists who stopped by. Sometimes JC was a bit \\"solemn\\" (I was going to say \\"pompous\\") but maybe that was the style on TV at the time and some passages are priceless. Especially the Waylon Jennings segment. I'd heard about Waylon via The Highwaymen but \\"Only Daddy\\" really knocked my socks off and I've been scrambling to find out more about him since and getting deeper into his music. The dialogue with JC is good fun as their \\"When Waylon's out of Town\\" duo too!
B0040JHXTS|5.0|Classic Springsteen!  An excellent addition to a serious Boss collection. Made me miss Danny and appreciate a younger Big Man and the best band in the land. I loved the video especially the Houston concert. Buy it despite the price.
030746363X|5.0|This book is really superb.  As Tim says, it is quite long, and you should dip into the chapters which are relevant to what you want to achieve now.  I did in fact skim read the whole book, then went back the chapters I want to use right now.  Tim has a lot well researched strategies - some of them quite surprising and/or offbeat, but still apparently very valid - for managing fat loss and muscle gain.  He also sets out a system which allows some (extreme and enjoyable!) deviation off the healthy range of foods in the diet plan, so that one is more likely to be able to stick to the plan.  Some great tips on the importance of measuring where you are - the DEXA scan (I took mine last week) tells you how it really is for your body fat - so you can measure your progress.  Without measurements as he says it's like being lost with no map and no GPS, and then you are likely to give up.  The Four Hour Work Week - Expanded Edition - is also great.  I have started clearing ancient junk and clutter out of my house and office directly as a result of reading that, and am working on implementing some of the other lifestyle changes.  Tim many thanks for both books - on your next trip to Thailand you are welcome to stay as my guest at Beach Republic resort!
B0044XV3QY|2.0|The second issue of Avatar, the one with all the great extra goodies that Avatar fans did not get when they bought the first issue.  And no subtitles on the special features?    Why do so many vendors ignore the needs of the hearing-impaired?  Shame on James Cameron and on Twentieth-Century Fox. This thing is going back.
B002ZG993Q|5.0|This is a great movie.  However, it is NOT an action movie.   The feel is more along the lines of [[ASIN:B00009ATIX Solaris]], also a Clooney movie.   There are many slow, long takes, a lot of staring into space, a lot of brooding, etc.   It's nothing like a James Bond movie, nor anything in the Jason Bourne series, etc.   If you liked Solaris, you might like this too.   Just don't rent it if you're looking for an action movie.   Other than Clooney's face, it has nothing in common with Ocean's 11 or anything like that.   There is no witty repartee, no free-running, no rappelling off skyscrapers, and no hacking into mainframes.   It's a great movie with a very classic, even retro, feel to it.
030745455X|5.0|The Girl who Played with Fire / 978-0-307-27230-0<br /><br />In my review of \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\", I stated that the book was a serious slow-starter and the main characters sometimes smelled a little \\"Mary Sue\\"-ish, but that if you stuck with the book, it was definitely worth it - sometime around the 1/3 mark the narrative picks up tremendously and it's a wild ride from there on in. \\"The Girl who Played with Fire\\" is more of the same - both the good points and the bad.<br /><br />I was a little disappointed to see that \\"Played with Fire\\" starts out almost as slowly as its predecessor, and the Mary Sue factor has ramped up as well. We're introduced to Salander on her extended vacation, as she lounges by the beach memorizing math textbooks and solving complicated theorems in weeks (where previously the world's greatest mathematicians required years to do so). Like \\"Dragon Tattoo\\", however, somewhere about the 1/3 mark, the action picks up tremendously, as we find Salander embroiled in a hunt for a murderer that has both the street gangs and the police hunting for her head.<br /><br />The focus is definitely fully on Salander this time around - Blomkvist struggles valiantly to provide much of the same support that Salander provided for him the first time around (research, advocate, and rescuer), but Salander is quite literally the star of the show. Whether this will please or frustrate fans will likely depend on what they liked most about \\"Dragon Tattoo\\" - the \\"cold case\\" research angle has been toned back tremendously in favor of a heated chase for Salander - but I enjoyed the novel immensely even without the intriguing \\"cold case\\" angle that made \\"Dragon Tattoo\\" so memorable.<br /><br />Also like \\"Dragon Tattoo\\", \\"Played with Fire\\" has a strong focus on the oppression of women and lower classes in society. Where \\"Dragon Tattoo\\" embodied these issues in Salander and in the history of Harriet Vanger, \\"Played with Fire\\" raises the stakes to show how systematic prejudice can be - despite the eye witness testimony of all of Salander's closest associates, the police remain steadfastly convinced that Salander is an illiterate prostitute for much of the novel, largely because of a single police report that was never substantiated or validated in any way. Although some members of the police force are sharply outlined as sexist and classist, even the \\"good\\" officers are too unwilling to question the system and look past their own prejudices. The net is expanded, too, this time, with the author also showing homophobia and how it has no place in society in general and police investigations in particular.<br /><br />If you liked \\"Dragon Tattoo\\" and came away wanting more of Salander, then \\"Played with Fire\\" is definitely for you; if you mostly liked the cold case angle, though, then you may enjoy this novel slightly less than the first. Also, do check out the audiobook narration - the reader is the same narrator as was used with \\"Dragon Tattoo\\" and the reading is flat-out superb.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardollye witness testimony of all of Salander's closest associates, the police remain steadfastly convinced that Salander is an illiterate prostitute for much of the novel, largely because of a single police report that was never substantiated or validated in any way.

B003S897U0|4.0|This quickly became my favorite Black Crowes release. That's saying alot considering the first three albums. Twenty Crowes classics, unplugged/acoustic or whatever, at a single cd price. Best of all, they nail nearly every track. Even the songs we've heard 500 times sound fresh again. My personal favorites: Soul Singin' sounds great, Ballad>Wiser Time, Morning Song, and the cover of Gram Parsons' She. Of the songs I didn't know before, which was only 3-4, my favorite discovery by far is Cold Boy Smile. Now one of my top 5 all-time songs of theirs, and so glad they opened with it when I saw them last fall. One other thing, the packaging is pretty cool. If I had to complain about anything, it's the lack of any songs from their last album, Before The Frost. No biggie. This collection is a must whether you've been a fan for twenty years or twenty days.
0316098337|5.0|I purchased Room: A Novel for the Kindle on the recommendation of one of my favorite authors, Leslie Kagan, and I feel a strong need to thank her for this suggestion.  From the moment my download completed, five-year old Jack grabbed my hand and pulled me through page after page of this incredible and thoroughly believable tale.  I breathlessly worked through the book and found myself longing for it when I took a break.  I haven't felt this way about a book in years.<br />Room is written brilliantly from the point of view of five-year old Jack, a boy who knows only his captive mother and the room they have shared since his birth.  Jack spends day after day in Room as his Ma does her best to make a normal life for him.  This amazing story feels as though it is ripped right from the headlines, and its retelling from a child's point of view is compelling and so viscerally real.  The only disappointment I had in this book was when I found myself at its end.
B003L20IFQ|2.0|You know how frustrating it can be when you call the customer service department of various utility companies, retail stores and large corporations, right? Well, someone thought it would be a great idea to make a movie built around that concept but instead of putting the frustrated caller in the comforts of his own living room, they put him inside of a coffin  along with a cell phone and buried him. That pretty much sums up this yawner of a movie.     The number of characters are very limited in this movie and the main character is played by Ryan Reynolds. He is just not a strong enough actor to carry a movie that involves such a small number of characters. I never had the sense that he was actually in any real danger and a better actor could have at least projected this feeling to the viewer.     What makes this movie even worse than the plot is the fact that it is hard to even care about the main character. You can almost imagine many scenarios that would have led him to his predicament and most of them developing from situations he probably created with his own mouth. Oh, you will identify with him only because you will recognize the frustrating telephone scenarios but you will probably identify more with the person on the other end of the line.    Well, at least this film has some good laughs. Too bad that the laughs all have to deal with the coffin obviously growing and shrinking throughout the movie. It appears that the main character can barely move around in the coffin one minute and in the next minute, the coffin looks big enough to play 18 holes of golf inside of it.    This is simply not a good movie. Now, I will place you on hold while you are directed to a movie that is more palatable.

1599218011|5.0|I was so excited to crack open my new copy, it was better than Christmas.  Is it possible to have your heart swell with pride for someone you don't even know?  That is how I feel when I read the book.  I am so proud of Kris!  She has written a beautiful book.  The way it is formatted, her joyous spirit that comes through in each and every word and the gorgeous pictures, the information that she floods you with, it is like having your own crazy sexy cheerleader in your pocket! She is alive, she is vibrant, she is a glowing example and has inspired me to really LIVE in so many ways.  This book is the match to light your bonfire and she keeps it going the whole way through!!  A comprehensive resource, now you can have just one book to turn to for tidbits, inspiration, recipes.  The whole shebang!
B0041VV03A|3.0|The trailers are a bit misleading. Once you get over that, the movie has some good spots but overall its just so/so. If you like the genre its probably worth a rent but only if you are a fan. I watched this in the theater and was disappointed as its totally a made for dvd movie.

0595440096|5.0|My granny was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in 1998 and died in 2001. I have been wanting to buy this book for over a year now, because I still have not healed from watching Alzheimer's take over my granny's life. I am not quite finished this book (only about 10 or 11 chapters in) but so far I am not disappointed. It is a heartbreakingly accurate depiction of the disease and the effects it has on everyone in the family. I have cried at least five times already, having remembered those exact things happening to my granny. If any of your loved ones have this disease, this is the book to read. Part proceeds go to the Alzheimer's Association as well. The only thing I have to say about this book is that it does use a lot of large, scientific words that I tend to skip over because I don't quite understand.....but other than that it is so far a great book. For anyone who hasn't experienced Alzheimer's first hand, it is a scary book. For those who have experienced Alzheimer's first hand, it will be a terrifying book to read. Having said that I fully recommend it.

B001QOOCTE|5.0|This is the CD that introduced the world to the \\"Playing for Change\\" organization, and it is now the first of several Playing for Change CDs.  The producers of the CD traveled the world recording talented singers and musicians performing the songs, and they then spliced the performances together to create a wonderful tapestry of excellent and joyous playing and singing.  I first heard of it on the radio, saw videos online, bought the CD for myself, and then bought more to give as gifts.  The package includes a DVD as well as the CD, so that you can watch the performers rather than just listen to them.  Most of the songs are well known, although the performers are generally unknown (other than an appearance by Bono).  The music is wonderful, and the philosophy behind the Playing for Change Project is \\"Peace Through Music.\\"  It is upliftng and inspiring.  You owe it to yourself to have a copy of this.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|I was intrigued with Claire Danes on site, then watched the trailer online and knew I wanted to see this movie. Love stories based on the true life of someone who has overcome adversity and given the world a lesson in suck it up !  Any parent with an autistic child should watch this and realize their child has potential--perhaps not in doing what Temple did, but in doing something worthwhile. But it takes a parent who is willing to not allow that child to be labeled handicapped--not in the parent's mind, not in the child's, and not in the world's mind.  Bravo to Temple's mom and all the parents out there who won't give up on their special kids!
0156421178|5.0|George Orwell (real name Eric Blair: 1903-50) is the widely known author of such classic novels as \\"Animal Farm\\" and \\"1984\\". In these novels the eloquent Mr. Orwell launches clever satirical attacks on modern totalitarianism and the repression of the human individual through propaganda.<br />  Lesser know is Orwell's work as a journalist. In \\"Homage to Catalonia\\" the English author reports on the 115 days he spent at the front in Spain fighting against the military revolt led by the Fascist soldier and eventual dictator of Spain the infamous Franco. Orwell fought in a Trotskyite miliia group in the Catalonia region near Barcelona. He suffered cold, hunger, the ravages of insect infections and was seriously wounded in the throat. Orwell and his wife had to escape from Barcelona to the safety of France due to his political party being banned by the Republican Communist government ruling Barcelona<br />  Orwell is one of the finest prose stylist in the English language. He always sided with the common man against dictatorship which would limit freedom and do away with justice.<br />  Some of the chapters in this book are somewhat dull; especially the ones dealing with the internecine conflicts and rivalries among the leftist forces in the Spanish Civil War. The reader would do well to read on that spring training war prior to World War II prior to perusing this eyewitness account. The book has been listed as one of the most important nonfiction works of the twentieth century. Orwell is always worth reading as he was a man of firm opinions;he was on the side of the angels in the struggle to be free.
B000244FDW|5.0|This is by far the best adaptation of the novel! it is so well cast, acted, directed, & really gives one a feel for the period. Some of the minor characters (mother, father, Mr. Collins)in other adaptations are treated as silly. In this one, they are real people - more similar to ones you know rather than characatures of people. The emotions of the characters are well displayed. One can understand each. Mr. Darcy begins very cold & aloof. As the story unfolds, he warms & relaxes a little. To my thinking, this version has depth, & insight. It is a great romance - not just for Elizabeth & Mr. Darcy, but also for Jane & Mr. Bingley!
1592402038|5.0|I am a born stickler.  I am passionate about written communication and even more passionate about clarity within that communication.  It is great to know that there are other people in the world who see signs in shop windows that appear to be written by people who failed to pay attention in all the years they went to grade school.  I have actually carried a Sharpie and corrected blatantly poor punctuation and grammar.  This book is fantastic and incredibly humorous.  The author has that fantastic British wit and it makes the book much like reading a script from a Monty Python sketch in places.  I highly recommend this book and the fact that it became a bestseller gives all of us sticklers hope!

0439023521|5.0|Could not put this book down. I am not a huge fan of post-apocalyptic books, but this book rarely focuses on that aspect. It deals more in the realms of society, courage, love, and most brutally: violence. I recommend to anyone who enjoys a gripping book that has you engaged with the charaters and what they do next.
B002QE3CTY|2.0|I have mixed feelings about this book. \\"Wake up with amnesia\\" has been done to death, but this is a fairly decent take on it.  The characters are interesting, the world is intriguing, and you really do want to find out what the heck is going on. However, the violence is extreme, and \\"bleak\\" doesn't even begin to cover the circumstances.  Mad Max looks positively utopian by comparison. Finally, the ending is unsatisfying. That is somewhat forgivable since this is the start of a trilogy, but the third book isn't out yet. I recommend waiting for the third book to be out before you start the series, because you really will want to read them all. Read this only if you're not squeamish, like really deeply layered mystery, and are prepared to commit to reading three full-length novels. I know it seems odd to give a book three stars and then say you won't be able to stop reading, but there you have it.<br /><br />UPDATE: After finishing the series, I say skip the whole thing.  Yes, it's well written, but it never makes any sense.  The whole thing is just to painful.
142311339X|4.0|I bought the book for my son after having looked at the photos posted.  First - the book is fine.  Just a regular, hardcover,copy of Riordan's The Lost Hero.  WARNING: The photos posted are totally misleading and should be removed.  They imply that the book is signed by the author and a \\"first edition\\" - totally false.  The photos seem to have been posted by someone (bookseller?) who had their own agenda - to sell a signed edition for 6 times more $?  Terrible.
B003F3FJQO|3.0|If you've read The Maze Runner, you must read The Scorch Trials. Period. Having said that, you only get a little bit closer to figuring out what the heck is going on.  The third book will define whether the series is great or a waste of time.  In the meantime, if you liked the first one, you'll like this one, and you'll be desperately waiting for the third one. You MUST read Maze Runner first; this book makes no sense without it.  The question is, do you read the first one? I haven't decided yet; I need to see how the series ends. In the meantime, look at the review of Maze Runner and decide if you want to read that. If you do, the review of Scorch Trials are irrelevant; you'll read it no matter what.
0525951652|3.0|The middle ground reviews for Fall of Giants appears to be a place inhabited by very few reviewers.  Based upon the disparity in stars issued it would appear that this is a book you either love or hate.  Personally, it looks like I fall into the category of \\"middle ground reviewer\\"  I found things in the book that were appealing and informative while certain plot line and continuity aspects of the story were not up to Mr. Follett's previously high standards.<br /><br />On the plus side, the historical aspects of the novel, i.e. WW1 and its outcome, the fight for women's rights, the rise of unions, the Russian Revolution, the formation of the League of Nations, and the interaction of historical figures, etc. were enlightening and made me want to delve further into this part of history by doing my own research.  The book also illustrates the absolute absurdity of war, the general incompetence of many of those in charge and graphically makes plain the fact that nothing has really changed in almost 100 years. The entire outcome of any war ultimately ends up being decided by politicians who have never set foot on a battlefield and who, like jockeys in a horserace, try to out-maneuver their opponent, negotiate concessions, and form alliances that will ensure their position in the world picture.  Additionally, the imagery Mr. Follett is able to conjure with his descriptive depiction of Welsh coal mines, English manor houses, and body strewn battlefields actually carries you away to that time and place.......a flair few authors possess.<br /><br />As for the negative aspects, my chief complaints are as follows:  Most of the non-historical characters created by Mr. Follett are rudimentary and as flat as a cardboard cut-out.  They are predictably, bad or good, heroic or pompous, innately intelligent or downright stupid.  Another complaint is that there are so many characters occupying these pages that one almost needs a score card to keep track of the players.  Finally, several of the romantic liaisons and their aftermath were elementary and foreseeable, and the dialog in the love scenes came across as overwrought and laughably trashy rather than wistful and endearing.<br /><br />This is definitely not War and Peace. Think of it more as Herman Wouk meets Margaret Mitchell. If overblown panoramic sagas are your cup of tea then put on the kettle and pick up your copy of The Fall of Giants. 2 1/2 starstic liaisons and their aftermath were elementary and foreseeable, and the dialog in the love scenes came across as overwrought and laughably trashy rather than wistful and endearing.

0439023521|5.0|I was initially hesitant to start this book (and another series) due to the \\"Young Adult\\" reading label. I'm a good bit older than a \\"young adult,\\" but that definitely didn't stop me from enjoying Suzanne Collins' The Hunger Games. In fact, I actually enjoyed the quicker pace and shorter overall length of the story and finished it in a single sitting (which was a necessity since I couldn't put it down). A very simple plot, sixteen-year old Katniss Everdeen lives in a post-apocalyptic society not too far removed from our current one on Earth. The science is a bit more advanced, and a war has resulted in totalitarian government called The Capitol. Societies are divided into 12 different districts, each accounting for a different trade skill. Every year, the government holds the Hunger Games, where two teenagers (male and female) are selected by lottery from each district and forced to compete in a battle to the death, with only one child surviving. The games serve as a form of punishment for a previous rebellion and to show the people that they are always under the complete control of the Capitol. The reference to the title comes from the lack of food that is a driving factor for survival during the games, and also an allusion to Katniss' own life in District 12, which is stricken by poverty and her daily quest to find food for her family.<br /><br />Character development is handled very well in Collins' novel. Immediately Katniss comes off as a liable protagonist. A strong and independent woman, who has spent her life trying to feed and care for her family, ensures that the reader's loyalties remain with her throughout the story. I believe that creating a likable character is critical to any fictional work. Too many times I have read a book from authors who have missed this point and I've spent 500 pages following someone who I did not have an emotional investment in. That's not the case with Katniss. She is strong but fallible. I'm not led to believe that she's a superwoman, so when she is in danger, I am lulled into a sense of fear for her survival, even though I know she is the main character and, with two sequels, don't have to worry about her dying too quickly. Given that there can only be one victor, and Katniss is seemingly charged with having to kill a minimum of one other contestant to win the games and stay alive, Collins still manages to handle this fact with aplomb while maintaining some sensitivity about her. The rest of the characters are well-developed as well. Even with 24 contestants in the Hunger Games, about half of them are given their own identities and perfectly described in a way that ensures that she doesn't take the easy way out, and just throw in 23 \\"villains\\" for Katniss to fight. She actually has a very clever way of handling this that separates her story from the numerous other \\"most dangerous game\\" concepts that have appeared over the last 100 years.<br /><br />While it is targeted as a young adult novel, I think The Hunger Games can be enjoyed by anyone 12 and up. Yes, it is fairly brutal, but I don't feel that the descriptions or subject material is bad enough where parents should keep this book away from children, who have most likely already been desensitized to this level of violence by that age anyway. As I said, it is not a masterpiece, but it did keep me thoroughly entertained and glued to the page. I honestly can't recall a single page I was bored with, and if a book manages to do that, it's hard for me to give it less than five stars. Anyone who enjoyed it and is looking for more, should check out Stephen King's [[ASIN:0451196716 The Long Walk]]n, so when she is in danger, I am lulled into a sense of fear for her survival, even though I know she is the main character and, with two sequels, don't have to worry about her dying too quickly.

B003SWNRU2|4.0|This is probably the best album they put out since RUSSIAN ROULETTE cause after that album, I had written them off for dead. I had no idea they had it in them to make a comeback with something killer. I guess it takes a few years of a hiatus to refresh and regroup into something more monstrous than before.    BEAT THE BASTARDS DOWN will probably beat your head in but the whole album is pretty much filled with fresh, pummeling riffs. Mark Tarnillo is a pretty good shrill vocalist substitute for UDO and I'm sure he'll do a great job filling in his shoes to cover classic ACCEPT tracks in concert.     Most songs on this album are very good and heavy especially toward the end with the remaining tracks from 9 to 13. Kudos to the guys for making an excellent comeback and hope you stick around for awhile. No need to bring back UDO - let him continue to do his solo thing.
1449382673|4.0|Excelente libro para iniciarse en Python. Con un enfoque totalmente diferente a lo que estamos acostumbrados en un libro técnico, te mete muy rápidamente en los temas importantes del lenguaje y en otros, que aún no siendo capitales, son muy interesantes y poco documentados.<br /><br />Está dirigido a gente con conocimientos de otros lenguajes, no es un libro para aprender a programar, es un libro para aprender Python. Da por sabidas muchas cosas y por eso mismo, no sigue la estructura clásica y repetitiva de este tipo de libros. Lo normal suele ser empezar por los tipos de datos, estructuras de control, etc... aquí se empieza directamente por el uso de listas y luego sigue con la distribución de nuestro código a la comunidad python, excepciones, ficheros, etc...<br /><br />Esto tiene su parte buena y su parte mala. Por el lado positivo tenemos la velocidad en el aprendizaje y la agradable noticia de que el aburrimiento ha muerto. La parte negativa es que la información, aún siendo muy rigurosa, no es completa. Por eso, debemos complementar este libro con algún otro, que nos sirva de referencia.<br /><br />A primera vista, la serie Head First de O'Reilly puede parecer poco seria. Está llena de fotografías impactantes y comentarios graciosos. Pero no se dejen engañar, todo esto es parte de un intento de mejorar la metodología del estudio. En el interior del libro tienen una explicación de la misma y una lista con consejos para mejorar el aprovechamiento de ese tiempo de estudio.<br /><br />From Google translator -><br /><br />Excellent book for beginners in Python.

On the positive side we have the speed in learning and pleasant news that boredom is dead. The downside is that the information, although very thorough, is not complete. Therefore, we must supplement this book with another, we serve as a reference.<br /><br />At first sight, the Head First series from O'Reilly may not seem serious.

B003VANOFY|5.0|My last Logitech headset recently conked out on me after about two years of use - I could still hear perfectly, but the microphone wouldn't pick up any sound. My last set was something similar to this, a wireless headset with some sort of noise cancellation that went on-ear instead of over-ear.<br /><br />I decided to take the plunge and buy these for a couple of factors (and I'm really glad I did). I wanted to have a headset with Dolby 7.1 for movie watching and for video games - and this has lived up to those expectations wonderfully. I also wanted to make sure that I got over-ear headphones because after long gaming sessions, or even a reasonably lengthy movie my ears would start to hurt with the ones I previously had. These have abolished that problem - they are extremely comfortable and very well put together. My only comfort gripe is that if you have a very large head, they might feel a little tight just below the temple.<br /><br />Like I said, they are very study and appear to be very well made. The microphone records extremely clearly and everyone I've spoken to says that I sound way better than I did with my previous headset. The range is okay, my house is fairly \\"wally\\" and as such after about 15 feet and two or three walls, it cuts out.<br /><br />I cannot emphasize, though, how comfortable they are to wear, and they make long gaming sessions a breeze.

B00005JLEU|5.0|Many people feel (including myself) that \\"Spirited Away\\" is Miyazaki's best work.  It's easily worth seeing more than once, more than twice, putting it in a very special category of work. This is possibly because Miyazaki does so much of his movies himself, giving a purity of purpose that most movies, made by committee, cannot possibly match if the single creator is so gifted, which Miyazaki absolutely is.<br /><br />The plot is surprisingly complex, with numerous characters who don't fit into stereotyped \\"good or evil\\" roles. Just watching the first 10 minutes reveals Miyazaki's almost unlimited imagination in action. \\"Spirited Away\\" is a bit over 2 hours long, considerably longer than most US animated works. So you get plenty of value, considering you will very likely end up watching multiple times over the years.<br /><br />\\"Spirited Away\\" focuses on a girl who faces all sorts of challenges, and is forced to grow up in order to save her parents, after they all became trapped in a completely different world they are sucked into after they lose their way. One involving aspect of the movie is that people and other beings in this other world are simply going to work, trying to make money, eating etc- their motives aren't different from ours. Magic is part of their lives, instead of facing, say, a corporate framework every day at work in our world. This makes their actions much more believable, enabling us to suspend our disbelief and enjoy the movie.<br /><br />The artwork is gorgeous, a visual feast if there ever was one. Some viewers feel that the movie is too dark, but is this different from old Bugs Bunny cartoons? In these you'll see exaggerated cartoon violence, involving blowing each other up with dynamite, falling off cliffs and so forth. In a nation that can't seem to detach from the the 9/11 terror attacks over 10 years ago, these cartoons actually might inadvertently remind some of the unthinkable. Miyazaki's work can't be any worse than these unintentional cartoon events and no kids should be prevented from seeing the movie. I myself had nightmares for years after seeing a Disney cartoon (Fantasia) many years ago, and since \\"Spirited Away\\" resolves very positively, I don't think children should be prevented from having such a rich experience.<br /><br />I don't know why Miyazaki makes his animes: is it to make an environmental statement? Because his talents must be exercised? Or maybe just because he can? Whatever the reasons, we are lucky to have the chance to see his work. His worlds are so strongly conceived, so complete, that they seem to somehow be \\"more real\\" than our mundane daily lives. For someone able to evoke such powerful imagery, it's not far from a definition of magic.  Something timeless and wonderful exists in \\"Spirited Away\\", something there isn't nearly enough of. If you haven't seen \\"Spirited Away\\", as the introduction says, you are in for a very rare treat.
B001HN694K|4.0|Some of my children are real Tim Burton fans, e.g., [[ASIN:B000C3L27U Tim Burton's Corpse Bride (Widescreen Edition)]], [[ASIN:B00447L4JG Nightmare Before Christmas]], but to be frank I haven't been that interested.<br /><br />This evening my 11-yr old daughter invited me to watch Burton's version of \\"Alice in Wonderland\\", so we sat down and watched it together.  I must admit that I went into the experience with low expectations, but was soon drawn into the story.  Without giving anything away, I saw parallels between the tradtional story and Burton's, even before Alice went down the rabbit hole to \\"Underland.\\"  That made it fun.<br /><br />It wasn't long before I saw that this version is a sequel to the original tale, and that was fun too.<br /><br />The imagery was classic Tim Burton...the shapes of the trees, etc., just oozed Burton through and through, and, of course, everything was mostly dark and dreary...again, Burton-esque.<br /><br />Burton's development of the story on screen was inventive and visionary, combining live action and aminated components to weave the tale.<br /><br />So, in the end I was engaged and interested all the way through...surprising myself with that!<br /><br />All in all I'd say that I liked it very much, though I wouldn't say that I loved it.  Even so, it's highly watchable, mainly for viewers over the age of 10 or so, but not for young children...at least that's where I'd pitch it.  There are a few somewhat gruesome scenes, but nothing I'd call gory.<br /><br />This is a a solid 4-star offering for me...a 50+ dad who likes a wide variety of movies.  This is one that can be enjoyed by viewers of different generations.

Simultaneously disturbing, hypnotic and probably the most beautiful film ever shot in digital black and white, Haneke's movie asks some very troubling questions about the nature of German society in the early years of the 20th century and the prevalence of unquestioned obedience, violence and malevolent forces hiding behind middle-class values and morality.  Haneke uses stock figures--the teacher, the doctor, the pastor, the midwife, the baron, his wife and the foreman on his estate--to analyze the forces at play over the course of a year in an isolated pre-industrial north German village around 1913, and the unexplainable evil that could break out in this microcosm.  The German edition of this movie is subtitled \\"Eine deutsche Kindergeschichte\\"--a German children's tale, because of the immensely important role that children play in this film.  Every time another accident, another crime happens, the children of the village just so happen on the scene shortly thereafter.  Is this coincidence, or are they the perpetrators of evil, a twisted generation reacting to the stifling restrictions of this suffocating society by getting their kicks hurting others, about to play out this evil in the Great War and beyond?    These young actors are amazing and they keep you constantly guessing. Haneke explains in the extras that he had to screen test over 2,000 kids in every major German-speaking city to find the right child actors, and even then had to look for more in Paris to finally cast the children's roles.  I have watched this movie six times, and I still haven't figured out who did what.  I have my suspicions. But it keeps gnawing at me, making me want to see it once more.  Naw, this isn't much 'for entertainment purposes,\\" but it's damned good art.  It deserved the Oscar nomination itgot, just as much as the Golden Globe it won.
B003CFBQBW|4.0|I like the music on this soundtrack.  Some of the songs on it I don't recall hearing in the movie.  Although I like them anyway and I've been introduced to some new groups (new to me) I would'nt have heard of otherwise.  I find the music to be uplifting and fun to listen to.
B0043A0PXU|5.0|Truly Beautiful. My brother has the cd & I heard it several years ago. He burned a copy for me, but its quality wasn't very good. It is no longer in print, but there was a used copy from an Amazon retailer n England for $27 & I ordered it. That should reflect how much I enjoy her beautiful, pure voice & the song selections. Enough said!
B0042816YK|1.0|I have never reviewed a movie.  This movie was so terrible, however, I thought I should warn you before you committed yourself to watch it with others.  Don't make this mistake!    The book has to be better than the movie!  The movie is a waste of time.  I felt no compassion for Julia Robert's character. Her big crises in life?  Not loving a devoted husband.  \\"Losing herself\\" in relationships as evidenced by the remodeling of her kitchen when she is not a cook.  Not being able to clear her mind during meditation.  Jumping from man to man to make herself feel better, and hurting these men in the process.    Her big contributions in life?  Praying for a 17-year old who does not want to be the bride in an arranged marriage.   Asking her friends to use the money they would spend on her birthday presents to help her friend in Bali buy a house.      If you want to see a self-indulgent, rich girl, cope with the \\"crises\\" she has created in life, then you may enjoy this movie.  Most of us, however, have pains much harder than this woman, and we have to pick ourselves up each day, go to work, and care for our loved ones.  It is hard to feel for a woman who has no real problems - save her selfishness - and then has the time and money to travel the world and make herself feel better.
B003WTE886|5.0|With her rather metoric rise thru to the top of the music business, obviously, millions like her previous CD's/music...Well, this certainly won't disappoint, so you can confidently purchase knowing you'll be satisfied! Good lyrics, edgy, it's Taylor! Enuf said.
0307454541|5.0|The title is misleading, the girl with the tattoo is not the leading character in this story. The role of protagonist falls to Mikael Blomkvist (for some reason the translator does not convert proper names to the English version, which makes some of them difficult), a financial journalist and incidentally a real ladies' man. The story begins, however, with two other characters, one a retired police man and the other a man whose name is not revealed and is left for later exposure, along with the reason for the flowers, whose delivery is given in this prologue. Then the story starts.<br />  The beginning starts with the end of the trial of Blomkvist for libel. He is found guilty and is fined and sentenced to jail, although internment is delayed. The plaintiff is an industrialist who felt libelled by Blomkvist in his magaszine, Millenium. The trial is widely publicized and Blomkvist feels betrayed but does not adequately defend himself in order to protect his source. Anyhow he is offered a job to find out what has happened to a young woman some thirty-six years earlier. The trial has brought Blomkvist to the attention of the woman's great-uncle and protector who feels the journalist has the qualifications necessary to pursue the case and add new findings to it. This man is one of the Swedish Vangers, a close knit industrialist family whose fortunes are slowly eroding with time. Henrik Vanger had taken Harriett under his wing and away from her parents. He still feels protective of her and her disappearance so long ago has become a source of discontent to him, he wants to find a solution before he dies. One of the levers he uses to snare Blomkvist as an investigator is possible evidence against Wennerstrom, the plaintiff in the libel case.<br />  This is a story so forget the unlikelihood of the journalist finding something everyone else has not discovered. This unlikelihood is the expression on Harriett's face in one of the photographs taken of her on the day she disappeared. Aha, the game is afoot and we are off to the races.One photograph leads to a search for many others, It is time for the tattooed lady to appear. Blomkvist hires her as a researcher, found for him by Henrik's lawyer. He has been sleeping with two other women, he just automatically adds Solander to his list. Lisbeth has many peculiarities, Blomkvist just as automatically uncovers them and changes Lisbeth's perception of them, not as bad but as prideful, Of course this helps her and improves her feelings for him. It is time for the denouement.<br />Naturally one of the Vangers is running the industrialist empire. Henrik had retired from the CEO position and let Martin run it, he tells Blomkvist Martin is best qualified. Martin seems to be a likable guy and is doing an adequate job running the company. But the photogra[hs lead to another picture of Martin. Blomkvist goews over to Martin's house and is captured. Now Lisbeth comes to his aid, frees him and Martin commits suicide. The reason for the suicide is hushed up and the search for harriett continues. The photographs provide additional clues and the story ends with the Vanger empire getting a new boss and Lisbth uncovering on Wennerstrom's computers evidence that he is an industrial pirate so Mikael gets his revenge on him as well. There are two books still to go and this one is so good I am looking forward to them.ed.

B0029LHW68|5.0|Totally unique, electronic sounds flowing through great guitar riffs. Awesome vocals that tell a story about love, life, and war.
B000NU2CY4|5.0|Be aware of the release date of this item in respect to the reviews. While they were correct that the transfer was an absolute mess, Paramount went back, corrected the issue and re-released the disc. As long as you purchase the one released in September, this should be the corrected version. Notice the negative reviews are from August and prior.
B001QERPDO|5.0|They wrote it, sang it, and perfected it! I loved this cd, like nothing I've really heard. Full of Irish flavor!
B0021L8V0W|2.0|I will not get into the specifics of the movie as many others have. I will say that the example given by one reviewer said it all in that it was almost like they didn't know how to make this movie's plot plausable. It reeked of lack of direction and some sense of realism. A Jolie fan might like it just because SHE is in it but take her away and there is almost no rason to watch this movie. There is a reason this movie went to DVD so quickly.
B0046ECFRM|4.0|the characters were funny and st.claire was sexy but the main character was so annoying.  Reminded me of the movie Mean Girls(not sure if its a bad or good thing.) I wouldnt go as far as saying BEST BOOK of 2010.
B0030BOCKK|5.0|I have been a HIM fan for nearly 10 years now. After the release of \\"Venus Doom\\" I started to drift away from their music but \\"Screamworks\\" has pulled me back in. From catchy song such as \\"In Venere Veritas\\" to beautiful ballads like \\"Acoustic Funeral\\" and \\"Disarm me\\", this has to be one of their best albums yet. Each song is both written, and composed beautifully. HIM fans can't help but love lyrics such as \\"Love is the devil counting teardrops in the rain, to the sound of a chalkboard symphony played with nails.\\", and that's just one of many poetic phrases in \\"Screamworks.\\" I loved HIM when I heard Razorblade Romance 10 years ago, and Screamworks has made me fall in love all over again. If your a fan of the band, or not, I highly recommend this album.
B003UBTX7C|5.0|To rate the book down because of the price seems quite unfair.  I protest:  The bad reviews and the price.  When I purchased my Kindle I was lead to believe, one would never have to pay more than 12.99 for books down loaded.    Enjoyed every page of Hell's Corner.  A fun edge of your seat \\"Who Done It\\"  with the great characters of the Camel Club.  Though reading Mr. Baldacci's previous books featuring Oliver Stone and \\"The Camel Club,\\" would enhance the experience.  Unlike Tom Clancy's works, you don't have to force yourself to get through the first 4 chapters.        More Camel Club adventures PLEASE!!!!!
B001684L0A|5.0|For those of you who enjoy history, albeit colorfully displayed, this series of docu-dramas is outstandingly well acted and directed. I have enjoyed it in blue ray, once you have seen the quality it is hard to go back! Enjoy!
B00338QENI|5.0|Like the majority of people I had never heard of \\"Henrietta Lacks\\" nor even the \\"HeLa\\" cells.  I think everyone should read this.<br /><br />Well written, the story caught my attention immediately with the 'introduction' of Henrietta to the author.  I'm around 75% of the way through the book but wanted to add my opinion to the postings now because I think this book is so important.<br /><br />Thank you, Rebecca Skloot, for taking the extended time and work to bring this book together and enable the world to acknowledge Henrietta's outstanding contribution to the health of the entire population.<br /><br />Deborah and other family members are also due our thanks as well as our apologies for the hardships they endured.  The background of their childhood after their mother died was heartbreaking. No child should be treated that way.  And how sad what poor little Elsie had to endure.  What a shock to find out some \\"treatment\\" wasn't discontinued until 1970!<br /><br />Thank you, Dorothy, for allowing us to read your mother's story.  I know it was a hard, brave thing for you to do.
B001CDZZI6|1.0|I purchased this book because it came highly recommended from a number of friends and professionals.  I was thrilled to see the Kindle edition was over 50% cheaper than the print version and promptly purchased it.  However, the Kindle edition does not come with a code, so you cannot even use the website to take the test and find your strengths.  I have returned the book and informed Amazon of this issue.  If you have a print version and only want the Kindle version for easy reference, this might be for you, but without the code, you can't do anything!
B001BTG3OQ|5.0|Bought this one on top of my SB-600 to start using the Nikon CLS system and I have to say it is a wonderful unit. Don't trust some of the reviews online they are quite deceiving. The unit is big, but not as huge as some are trying to make it sounds, just a couple inches bigger than a SB-600.<br /><br />The controls are amazingly simple to use and well laid out, no cumbersome combination of 2 buttons to set something up, hold the OK for a second and spin the wheel, simple as that. Also no on/off button but a switch, which makes it extremely easy to operate the flash without hunting for the right button. The same switch enables you to put the Flash in Remote or Commander mode (all you have to do is push the little button on the switch) without looking.<br /><br />So far I haven't had a change to work much with it, just some test shots in stand alone and some as part of a 2 speedlite setup, the result are amazing thus far. Both on and off camera.<br /><br />Will definitively look into getting a couple more of these puppies.
0385510454|5.0|The Broker by John Grisham is a great read with a compelling plot, engaging characters, and just the right amount of detail. This is my kind of book, one that combines action and intrigue colored with humor and personal interest.<br /><br />Joel Backman, the main character, would be an easy person to side against. The fat cat, jet-set, mega-rich DC lawyer finally has his shady dealings catch up with him and pays the price. Little does he know that simple justice isn't enough for some of his enemies, and soon enough he finds himself in the fight for his life - literally. The character portrayals are excellent, but the pace and intrigue make this a real page-turner.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book if you are a fan of Grisham's previous books, or if you enjoy an action-drama with a little humor. Well worth the price, and well worth your time.
1595141979|5.0|One word: AMAZING!    This is, so far, my favorite book in the series. It literally kept me up all night- I couldn't put it down. There were so many twists and turns to the plot that made it so interesting to read. Now I can't wait to read Blood Promise.    Richelle Mead is officially my favorite authors now.
030746363X|5.0|4-Hour Body is not just a weight-loss manual, it is an adventure story and catalysis for self-improvement plans. Tim Ferriss's daring experimentation is wild and engages the imagination but, by grounding his findings in science, he offers convincing arguments for intellectual buy in as well. Do I think he has the final answer on weight loss and fitness. No. Do I think it is worthwhile to try out his recommendations - yes. Essentially, he offers concrete advice but more importantly suggests that readers become active experimenters in their own body change. Fun. Weird. Motivating. And possibly life changing.
B0040UAYI4|5.0|This is my first review ever on Amazon, and the reason is because this is the first product I've ever felt so compelled to review. I switched from PC gaming to console about a year ago, but was one of those people who's very frustrated by dual-analog controls. I sort of stumbled upon the EEC, read a ton of reviews and watched YouTube vids, and decided to buy one. I have to say that this product is EXACTLY as advertised, it works perfectly, and is as close to PC gaming as you'll get on a console.     I happen to be using a Razer Death Adder mouse and cheap USB keyboard I bought on Amazon for $10. I will say that the higher-DPI mouse makes a HUGE difference in the feel. Before, I was using a Microsoft Intellimouse and it was jittery, slow, and inaccurate.    Long story short, if you're looking for mouse/keyboard gameplay on the PS3, it's not going to get better than this.    PROS:  - NO lag  - very smooth movement  - great in-game advanced calibration  - key-mapping software is easy to use  - very long USB cable    CONS:  - very long USB cable!  - in order to run the firmware updates, you need a 32-bit OS, so I had to install Windows XP using VMWare in order to update the firmware, as my computer has Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit.  - according to the forums on PenguinUnited's site, there are some incompatibilities with certain mouse/keyboard hardware, so make sure to check the forum for your mouse compatibility.
B003OF3R0S|3.0|Ok first off you see my star rating for this album..  I obviously feel this album has some good points and gasp..  some bad ones too.  If you can't accept someone having their own opinion, please do us both a favor and stop reading now.  I'm not a fanboy and won't just give everything they do top ratings because it's Avenged Sevenfold, or any band for that matter.    I didn't grow up listening to these guys.  I can't say I knew them, \\"way back when they were good,\\" or whatever.  I first heard about them with City of evil, like most people.  I really enjoyed that album, and was happy when I saw they had two more that came before, depressed slightly because I was excited to find an actual good new band, but ah well.  At the time they were still relatively new.  I didn't like either of the first two at the time, except for some songs.  And All Things Will End is still one of my favorite songs of their's.  At the time I haden't gotten into bands like Underoath or Killswitch engage, so I didn't really have an appreciation for the screaming in such large doses.  Eventually waking the Fallen did grow on me, and now I like that one quite a bit, mostly, but I still don't care for much of their first one.  I thought their self titled album was a bit uneven, but mostly I liked that one, couldn't stand the country song.  I grew up in a small Texas town, and had my fill of rednecks, so I can only handle a small country influence in a song.  and also, there was another really weird song I couldn't stand, but can't remember the name..  But, overall I enjoyed that one, which of course now brings me to Nightmare.    Honestly, there weren't enough surprises for me to feel like doing a track by track rating.  I really like Nightmare, Welcome to the family, and God hates us.  Although really?  Another negative God song?  Come on that subject has been done to death, but it's still a good song.  Overall I can listen to all the tracks from 1-7, and I enjoy them all, but after that, is where I start to have problems with the album.  Three straight slow and boring ballads, that are so forgetable I can't even remember enough to really comment on them.   The only thing I remember is the intro to one reminding me of the last song on Bruce Dickinson's \\"Accident of birth,\\" album, and it making me want to hear that instead.  I don't mind slower songs, but they jumbled them all together, which I feel is a mistake, because when I hit that part of the album, I lose interest.  Save me ends the album on an alright note.  The song's kind of long for what it is, but it's better than the previous three songs.  Honestly I don't really know that song as well as I'd like because listening to the previous tracks usually puts me to sleep, or gets me interested more in whatever I'm doing whilst listening to the cd.  The music is still pretty good, and the lyrics, to me, are pretty blah.  they neither inspire me, nor make me want to turn it off.    Overall if you like all their previous albums, then you'll like this one too.  I just wish they'd went straight from God hates us, to Save me, or maybe kept one of those other ballads, but that's it..  It's still a good cd worth adding to your collection.  I'm just frustrated because I feel like these guys have the talent to do so much more than they've done.  Oh well
B000SGGUWS|5.0|this was an awesome book about high school girls getting into high school girl trouble. the real deal. its a bit vile and probably not a book to give to your ten year old, due to suggestiveness and language, but aside from that, its an amazing book. definitely worth reading for ages 14+.
0307236722|4.0|I had never baked anything except box cupcakes which I iced with can icing before I bought this book.  I made cranberry-pistachio biscotti.  The best biscotti I have ever eaten.  Next up was the parmesan-Rosemary crackers.  Both were well worth the effort and looked just like the pictures in the book.  Today I am making the blackberry roulade.  I would highly recommend this book for anyone new to baking.  I cannot speak for those who are experts in baking.
B0034G4OVS|4.0|A starmaking performance by newcomer Emma Bell propels this harrowing, bleak story of survival.  Helmed by HATCHET director Adam Green, the movie benefits from stunning location shooting, a marvelous score from Andy Garfield, and the sheer hopelessness of our heroes.  Shawn Ashmore and Kevin Zegers are quite convincingh but it's Bell's turn that sticks with you long after viewing.  Her concern over her puppy's fate and her humiliation over wetting herself is heartwrenching.<br />Much more than a horror movie, FROZEN is rightfully chilling.
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|The purchase process was easy.  I got my shipment in a timely manor.  I was pleased with the condition of the merchandise when I recieved it.
B000H7JCIW|5.0|This is Liza at her best.   What a fabulous evening of entertainment, and thank goodness it has been recorded and saved for years of enjoyment.
B0000E6XH3|5.0|If you love Daft Punk (and/or their album Discovery) then you will LOVE this movie. I am usually bothered by movies that do not have words, such as this one, but in this case it had no influence on me! In fact, it made it cooler that the music and animation tells the whole story without the need for dialogue.  I suggest it for anyone who love Daft Punk or wants to hear more of their music.
B0036EH3WK|3.0|This is not a review of LOST, but specifically of this collection of Blu-ray discs, the extras, and the packaging.  I have been waiting for the complete series of Lost on Blu-ray since Blu-ray won the great format war.  I was extremely excited when it was released in August, but waited until Black Friday to purchase it and am very happy to own this set.  I love the show and will get hundreds of hours of enjoyment watching it again.  That said, I have a couple complaints about this set.  First off, I do not like the packaging of this set at all.  The presentation of this set is really unique and attractive, but I don't want this huge (13\\" x 11\\") box sitting around in my TV room.  I would have thought that the internal box that holds the actual blu-ray discs would be more appropriately sized, and, while it is significantly smaller than the pyramid, at 10.5\\" tall it is much bigger than a standard DVD box and won't fit on most DVD shelves.  The box that holds the individual sleeves  as well as the sleeves themselves are comparatively cheaply constructed as well (that is what I would prefer to be sturdy...)      My other complaint is with the included Senet \\"game\\".  I was misled into believing that an actual game was included-- i.e. something that I could play with friends.  However, the game is just a prop-- there are no instructions/rules.  Knowing Lost, perhaps the instructions are secretly hidden somewhere \\"out there\\" and left to the user to unearth.  (However, if that is the case, then they could have at least mentioned that somewhere in this set.  Since they did not, I doubt that is the case.).  The other tchotchkes provided in the set are nice if you like those type of things.  The episode guide is well done, but again over-sized.    I do like the extra digital content on the discs themselves.  Lost was a fantastic journey and, as a fan, getting insight into the making of the series is very enjoyable.  I especially enjoyed the mini documentary regarding the finalepisode, and watching Jorge Garcia read the script and seeing his reaction.  The other extras are mostly enjoyable as well, including the \\"never before seen footage\\" which put a nice cherry on the series (although, I can understand why it wasn't aired-- it would have totally changed the emotional ending to the finale).
B003H9MSPG|2.0|this weapon totally is not a good sniper rifle. It can't shoot very far. it would make the sniper really sad if he bought this gun. It just looks good.
0525951652|4.0|If you were never into dull history presented by textbooks for class credit and a grade, but really did want to read about what times were like in England, Germany, Russia and to a smaller extent France, in the early 1900's, than this is a book for you.  Ken Follett tells the story of different families from different classes in life in different nations, all brought together by different series of events of WWI.  A constant theme through the story, aside from what happens to all the characters he creates, is the ability of reason to be buried under emotion which drags nations into the war, resulting in millions of deaths, destruction, poverty, and ultimately the turning on it's head of the aristocratic class structure, from the Tsars in Russia, to the aristocracy in Germany and England; ending in a triumph of democracy in England, the begining of Nazi rule in Germany, and Lenin and Stalin in Russia.  I look forward to following the characters as they go through WWII, which is probably the next book Follett is working on.
B004GNYGTI|4.0|It was a great movie, and I was at the edge of my seat the entire time.  I just wish there was an actual end to the movie.  With that said, I will definitely see the sequel.
0060723513|5.0|Why are so many so quick to shoot the messenger?  If taken in the proper light, this book has a very rare life-changing quality.  It is highly suspect why so many reviewers take the offensive stance.  Do not let the negative reviews sway your opinion whether or not to read this book.  This book can be a journey into yourself and your place in the cosmos as well as that of humanity. If you resonate with the desire to lift your consciousness....then read this book.
B0042816YK|5.0|If you are a Julia Roberts fan, then this movie is a must see.  If not, then the storyline and the performances, especially Julia, will have you loving the movie.  Well worth a watch.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I haven't worked out in almost a year, and after just completing my very first session, I'm glad this is the work out I chose to start with! It is tough and you really want to take a break, but she keeps reminding you that if you are only working out for 20 minutes a day you have to give it your all if you want to see results. There are no breaks during the workout, just easier routines but you are constantly working some part of your body. I am really excited about this workout and plan on purchasing 6 weeks six pack after i complete the 30 day shred.    This seems to be a great program, and Jilian is encouraging and motivational through the workouts! This is a great start if you want to move into working out on a regular basis. I felt so good after my first session!!
0671042858|5.0|The title sounds like some kind of love story.  But no, it's the story of a little girl lost in the woods.  Begins innocently enough, and before you know it, you feel as lost as she is, and just as helpless.  Near the end, the character has captured your heart and you can't pull yourself away because you so want her to survive her ordeal.  Her imaginary friend is Tom Gordon who appears to her and helps her survive her loneliness.  Imagine a nine year old lost in the woods and trying to survive.  Now that is horror.  This is the 17th SK book I've read and it's one of his absolute best.
B002ZG994U|3.0|I never saw the television show so I think that hurt my enjoyment of the film.<br /><br />The A-Team throws a crew of unruly Army Rangers together to play outside the normal parameters of military engagement. This sets them up for betrayal and double crosses.<br /><br />The movie stars, Liam Neeson, Jessica Biel, and Patrick Wilson among other no-namers. It's one thing when you're an actor like Neeson and come out with other excellent work leaving you with the enjoyment of these fun films. It's another thing when you're Biel and Wilson and you have to make these films because no one else will hire you.<br /><br />After one of the secret missions ends with the death of their commanding officer, the A-Team is disbanded and sent to prison. They know they've been framed and it's their job to break out of jail, determine who it was who set them up, and exact revenge.<br /><br />The movie is full of semi-cool eye candy special effects and unbelievable action sequences. Most of the character development would probably make more sense to me if I had seen an episode of the original show.<br /><br />This is just fine for a rental or even better if a friend lets you borrow it. Don't bother with a purchase.
B002RKSZKI|5.0|\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition\\" is a suitable heroine for Jane Austen's lightest, frothiest novel. While \\"Emma\\" is not nearly as dramatic as Austen's other works, it is an enchanting little comedy of manners in which a young woman with the best intentions meddles in others' love lives... with only the faintest idea of how people (including herself) actually feel.<br /><br />After matchmaking her governess Miss Taylor, Emma Woodhouse considers herself a natural at bringing people together. She soon becomes best buddies with Harriet, a sweet (if not very bright) young woman who is the \\"natural daughter of somebody.\\" Emma becomes determined to pair Harriet with someone deserving of her (even derailing a gentleman-farmer's proposal), such as the smarmy, charming Mr. Elton. When Emma's latest attempt falls apart, she finds that getting someone OUT of love is a lot harder than getting them INTO it.<br /><br />At around the same time, two people that Emma has heard about her entire life have arrived -- the charming Frank Churchill, and the reserved, remote Miss Jane Fairfax (along with rumors of a married man's interest in her). Emma begins a flirtatious friendship with Frank, but for some reason is unable to get close to Miss Fairfax. As she navigates the secrets and rumors of other people's romantic lives, she begins to realize who she has been in love with all along.<br /><br />Out of all Jane Austen's books, \\"Emma\\" is the frothiest and lightest -- there aren't any major scandals, lives ruined, reputations destroyed, financial crises or sinister schemes. There's just a little intertwined circle of people living in a country village, and how one young woman tries to rearrange them in the manner that she genuinely thinks is best. Of course, in true comedy style everything goes completely wrong.<br /><br />And despite the formal stuffiness of the time, Austen wrote the book in a languidly sunny style, threading it with a complex web of cleverly orchestrated rumors and romantic tangles. There's some moments of seriousness (such as Emma's rudeness to kind, silly Miss Bates), but it's also laced with some entertaining dialogue (\\"Silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way\\") and barbed humor (the ridiculous and obnoxious Mrs. Elton).<br /><br />Modern readers tend to be unfairly squicked by the idea of Emma falling for a guy who's known her literally all her life, but Austen makes the subtle relationship between Knightley and Emma one of affectionate bickering and beautiful romantic moments (\\"If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more. But you know what I am. You hear nothing but truth from me\\").<br /><br />Emma is a character who is likable despite her flaws -- she's young, bright, well-meaning and assured of her own knowledge of the human heart, but also naive and sometimes snobbish. She flits around like a clumsy butterfly, but is endearing even when she screws up. Mr. Knightley is her ideal counterpoint, being enjoyably blunt and sharp-witted at all times. And there's a fairly colorful supporting cast -- Emma's neurotic but sweet dad, her kindly ex-governess, the charming Frank, the fluttery Miss Bates, and even the smarmy Mr. Elton and his bulldozing wife.<br /><br />\\"Emma\\" is the most lightweight and openly comedic of all Jane Austen's novels, with a likable (if clueless) heroine and a multilayered plot full of half-hidden feelings.

B004132HZS|5.0|Oh no, not another version of Sherlock Holmes. Hasn't everybody done Holmes? Starting in 1905 when the first film about Arthur Conan Doyle's legendary consulting detective was created it seems that the character has been a staple for every studio and many lead actors since. Most of us are familiar with the Basil Rathbone series which began with \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\" in 1939, the Christopher Plummer Holmes of \\"Murder By Decree\\", Nicole Williamson's Holmes from \\"Seven Percent Solution\\" and on and on. And, of course, we mustn't forget the recent Robert Downey Jr. Holmes franchise which will shortly release its second feature in the series.     It seems that everyone has tried to breath a new life, a new twist into the culturally pervasive story of the oddball but fascinating mega-minded character. What is there left to do? We've seen Holmes take on Jack the Ripper (\\"Murder By Decree\\"), interact with Sigmund Freud (\\"Seven Percent Solution\\") and even his first encounter with his estimable companion, Dr. John Watson during their early school days (\\"Young Sherlock Holmes\\").     Amazingly, the BBC has managed to elevate the character to even new heights with its new series simply titled \\"Sherlock\\". A glance at the combined average rating of this product should show how well they have succeeded.    Set in contemporary London this Holmes operates in a world of electronic media, cell phones, texting and the internet, all technologies which should deminish the uniqueness of the character, at least to some extent. After all, nowadays anyone with a laptop can do instant research on practically anything, virtually turning themselves into a source of endless information, like Holmes himself. Yet even folding these technologies into the universe in which this Holmes operates, the series manages to present Holmes as leaving a world of instant information in the dust.    The recent theatrical feature by Guy Ritchie, starring Robert Downey Jr., chose to be more true to the original Conan Doyle character as it was first concieved. It is set in Victorian London of the 1880's, when the stories were first written, and heavily infused with Ritchie's own wry, biting sense of ironic humor. Ritchie's Holmes is very much the action-adventure hero, surrounded by amazing special effects, exciting dangers and intriguing mysteries. He romps around town making understated wisecracks and relying as much on martial arts as his phenomenal mind.    But BBC is television. That means much smaller production budgets, tighter time frames and a strong focus on characters. How could it hope to compete?    Two words: Stephen Moffett, the series creator.    For those who know him, he is the current producer, hear writer and driving force behind the immensely popular \\"Doctor Who\\" series, having taken over that seemingly eternal BBC sci-fi franchise this season from original producter Russell T. Davies, and he seems to be capable of rising to any challenge. On the \\"Doctor Who\\" series he took over in the wake of what many supposed to be the ultimate imagining of the Doctor as played by David Tennant. When it was announced that the seemingly perfect Doctor (Tennant, who literally owned the character for five seasons) was going to leave and be replaced by relatively unknown Matt Smith, there was much concern the quality, the imagination, the wit, charm and brilliance of the show would quickly sag back toward something much more mundane. But it didn't. Knowing he could never copy or even emmulate Tennant's Doctor, he chose to shift the whole thrust of the character sideways and it is working perfectly. He has done the same thing with Holmes.     Coming virtually on the heels of the Robert Downey theatrical release it might at first glance look like an exploitation copycat knock off, so common in media entertainment. In fact it might very will be one of the best versions of the character ever created.    The acting is of stellar quality from the entire cast, the dialogue beautifully subtle yet sharp and witty beyond belief. But it is the intricate, almost intimate structuring of the plot, repleat with layer on top of layer of twists, turns, loop-de-loops and head-turning shocks that elevates this series to new heights.    Many mystery fans savor the opportunity of trying to figure out \\"whodoneit\\", trying to \\"get it\\" even before the characters reach the inevitable revelation that explains everything. Sometimes they are diappointed when elements and \\"clues\\" are kept hidden until the very last moment and then suddenly revealed making the solution blindingly obvious. (Agatha Christie is routinely guilty of this). Other times the plots are so convoluted and presented so subtly that they produce a kind of numbness, turning them into almost a chore to track, absorb and process (John Le Carre's George Smiley is often guilty of this).     Moffett's Holmes has found the perfect balance. Even those times when the audience manages to run a bit ahead of Holmes in understanding how various clues fit together, there is always more to follow and the next step toward the solution remains excitingly shrouded and tantalizing. And those ultimate revelations, when they at last arrive, don't plop down out of left field or simply confirm some speculation we had figured out many scenes ago. This Holmes keeps you rivetted every step of the way and the world in which he operates (contemporary London) is seamlessly logical and fascinating.    I have thus far watched only the first of the two disks and am eager to absorb the rest. Each of the four episodes of the initial series is a full feature film, running 90 minutes, giving ample time and space for the story to be fully developed at a comfortable pace, and allowing enough time for us to get a good view of the quirkiness and undeniable charm of the characters.    Any mystery fan will love this series. So will those who savor great writing, engaging plots and solid acting. It is definitely one to own.One final thing that was a huge breath of fresh air. The \\"officials\\" and police are not idiots, bent on preserving their own egos, careers or authority by constantly obstructing Holmes at every turn. They don't necessarily like Holmes, and might resent needing his help to do their jobs, but they are at least smart enough and \\"real\\" enough to know they must work with him to get the job done. For this alone this version of Holmes ranks at the top of heap of the legendary consulting detective's collected adventures.

Inspired to eat and cook and eat some more.  I purchased her cupcake book because I'm a sucker for desserts and ones that are as simple as cupcakes.  While I haven't actually made anything from the book yet, judging from the recipes, I'm going to be pleasantly surprised with the results.  I do tend to make modifications since I'm not vegan and don't always have the proper materials readily available but all of Isa's recipes I've made have always been awesome!  I have no doubt in my mind that all of these cupcakes will be too.
B0025KVLS8|5.0|Although this CD is in MONO, it is a terrific CD.  The Beatles are intoxicating bringing back great memories of long ago.  Seems like the songs aren't stacked the same way as the United Artists album was, but that may be my rusty memory.
031603438X|5.0|It's difficult to know where to start discussing a book that takes as its subject a life as eventful as Keith Richards'. It's the kind of book where I wish I had read it with a pen or a highlighter at hand so I could mark down particularly amusing or insightful passages (unfortunately, I didn't). LIFE is unsurprisingly fascinating and surprisingly aphoristic; Keith, along with collaborator James Fox, lays down a conversational and witty narrative filled with observations that are as terse and pungent as his guitar riffs. This is seldom more apparent than when Richards is discussing his fellow Rolling Stones (on Mick Jagger and his infamously (ahem) multi-faceted personality: \\"Do you know Mick Jagger? Yeah, which one? He's a nice bunch of guys.\\"; on Charlie Watts and his idiosyncratic technique of \\"pulling back\\" from the hi-hat on the second and fourth beats beats of the bar: \\"It'll give you a heart arrhythmia if you look at it.\\")    Something I wanted to make sure to point out (in case someone has stumbled upon this review by accident and is not familiar with Keith's sordid past): this is not a book for the judgmental, the prudish, or the weak of heart. There's stuff that even a long-time, knowledgeable Stones fans may find a bit shocking; one story that springs to mind is the one about how Keith, high on smack, would drive with his young son Marlon riding along while on tour in Europe in mid-Seventies.    But that which makes the book occasionally hard to take is precisely what makes it so great - Richards pulls absolutely no punches, and it makes for riveting reading. If you're looking for the real Keef, warts and all, you've come to the right place.
0316010669|5.0|Gladwell writes about the \\"24/7 mental valet,\\" which is really nothing more than the \\"superconscious,\\" the corollary to the subscious.  While the subconscious is below our consciousness, the superconscious is above it, although we are no more conscious of it than the subconscious.  It is responsible for the \\"instinctive\\" responses (yes, even humans have instincts), and is the overseer of the sleep/wake cycle.  The conscious is awake during the day, the subscious is awake at night, but the superconscious is the 24/7 mental valet that controls both cycles.  It also controls the 50/50 distribution of male/female children--there can be no other explanation than a force interwoven among the greater human population that controls the even distribution of children across individual women throughout all species.      It is akin to the economic theory of the efficient market hypothesis, which says that all information is incorporated into the market and reflected in a random walk of stock prices.  The superconscious is also akin to the \\"invisible hand\\" of evolution which guides all species to their highest function.

B000AJJNPY|1.0|Tinkle, tinkle, tinkle, tinkle go the sounds of toys and music boxes, and keyboards mimicking both of them... endlessly and with no apparent purpose other than to serve as the backdrop for further tinkling. \\"Yeeeeeeeeeeeeee\\" sings the lead singer \\"YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE SAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY YEEEEEEEEEE\\", and repeat for the entire duration of the album. Meanwhile, more tinkling, and guitars that try and do battle with the singing, \\"yeeeeeeeeeeeee  saaaaAAAAAAAAAYYY\\". Now, both the guitars and the singer are singing in higher and higher registers, the guitars yelping like an asthmatic animal and then, tinkle, tinkle, tinkle. Suddenly, CLOP CLOP CLOP CLOP CLOP go the drums CLOP CLOP CLOP CLOP. Now, all of these elements are going, on and on indefinitely, played by a band that arrogantly says \\"we don't like music\\" in its interviews. See, that's funny, because CLOP CLOP CLOP CLOP CLOP CLOP tinkle tinkle tinkle tinkle tinkle YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE  SAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYYYY is much better than any other music around.

B000001YOW|5.0|This is as uncompromising as Porcupine Tree gets. Before they went more metallic in the millenium decade starting with 'In absentia', Steve Wilson and co,were alternating ,darkly ambient sound scape music along with downbeat, catchy melodic songs on this effort. Signify is dark,and sometimes unsettling in nature. How can tracks such as 'Waiting','Sleep of No dreaming', 'Sever', and 'Dark Matter' be uplifting? Still and all, they are melodic songs displaying Wilson's gift for songwriting.  The darkly ambient material such as 'Intermediate Jesus', 'Light Mass Prayers' are the highlights for me. These are some of the more dark, disturbing instrumentals these ears ever heard. They just leave you with a very uneasy, unsettled feeling. If Steve Wilson chose to, he could conjure an incredible  soundtrack to a movie.  'Signify' is an uptempo, energetic , instrumental rocker, while 'Idiot prayer' actually has a danceable quality.  This album was definitely progressive music, redefining what the genre should have been, instead of most it being a  redundant rehash on the Yes/Genesis sound. If only more people had listened at the time, this album could have been bigger instead of remaining an overlooked gem.  The extra disc of demos from that period are quite interesting and only add to the high quality inherent on the regularly released album.
B003JTHESA|5.0|This album is truly epic and shows that Iron Maiden is still at the top of metal after over 30 years. Every track really is a winner and the feel of the album is more personal.  Also, they have no lack of ideas: the album is the maximum time that fits on a CD, around 76 minutes! A somewhat more progressive structure, slower pace and sound is original but still loyal to the overall feel of Maiden.  Maiden fans should already have this album by now; but if you are just getting into Maiden then even though Final Frontier stands on its own I suggest AT LEAST buying Powerslave, Number of the Beast, and Seventh Son first, to appreciate it but keep this album near top on your list to purchase. I would rate it as high as the other post 2000 releases [[ASIN:B00004TH7Z Brave New World]], [[ASIN:B000H7JD4A Matter of Life & Death (Snys)]], and [[ASIN:B0000BYM3K Dance of Death]], and they are ALL excellent Maiden.    Satellite 15...The Final Frontier -- heavy reverby drums, spacey intro but it still sounds Maiden and you know you're in for a 75 minute treat as the suspense builds. Vocals come in. I can understand people's comments about Bruce's high notes if you compare to their classic albums, but come on: it DOESN'T sound bad at all, it has a unique and experienced timbre.  Right in the middle of this track, it breaks into Final Frontier with that awesome sound characteristic of newer Maiden verses like in Matter of Life and Death.  And as he can do like few others (and certainly no one outside of metal), Bruce turns two word title into rocking chorus! A moderate-paced song to get you into the album.    El Dorado -- more classic sound, one of the best on the album, back-to-back solos    Mother of Mercy -- nice intro melody, beautiful natural development as the song progresses from the intro to first to second verse and finally into the almost painfully emotional chorus, excellent song    Coming Home -- nice slower harmonized riff to open up, the lyrics and vocal melodies are beautiful and relatable, chorus very catchy and has a slightly 80s hair metal sound (but good), nice two-part verse structure that is characteristic of much Maiden, soulful guitar solo; only complaint is the second part of the solo after transition did not quite blow me away like I would expect    Alchemist -- sound of the driving verse vocals remind me of classic maiden like Run to the Hills, the complex song structure that flows so well shows the skill of the writer, kick-[...] solo into metal melody    Isle of Avalon -- epic intro buildup that finally breaks into an excellent melody,     Starblind -- Likely favorite song on the album.  Intro turns an unoriginal melody into something interesting, tense, spacey. The reverb-heavy rhythm guitar was weird but really works for the sound of this song. First 2 minutes of this sound are tense and make you feel like it's really going somewhere, the chorus section 2:10-2:37 is one of my favorite moments of the whole album, I love the tuby-sounding lead guitar on the right side that makes me think of Hendrix and classic rock.  First listen of the chorus I was somewhat unimpressed by the simple direct correspondence between backing and vocal but now I think it really works well, gives me chills every time. The solo(s) are a beautiful mixture/alternation of something more flowy and Satriani-like with killer, hard classic metal.    The Talisman -- intro, Bruce shows his vocal virtuosity at playing a believable character; the first 2:20 is simply beautiful and chilling. Then the storm hits you hard with Maiden fury. This chorus really makes me think of Matter of Life and Death for some reason. When Bruce screams \\"Westward the tide\\" I can imagine the captain standing on the bow pointing. I would love to see this song live.    The Man Who Would Be King -- I have to admit this song sometimes puts me to sleep, but that's not necessarily a bad thing, and it's still very memorable after just a couple listens. The offbeat sound at 4:00is quite interesting with shredding in the back, goes with the spacey theme of this album. The riffs following this before the next verse are also quite good.    When The Wild Wind Blows -- The first time I heard this song I thought the melody was a bit goofy and uncharacteristic, but now this is one of my favorite songs on the album! The lyrics really hit you hard and they are so sad especially the end, and the vocal melody is very catchy throughout the entire song. The repeated 'metal guitar melody' riffs (such as that starting at 5:03) are simple and same notes as a lot of classics Maiden melodies like Fear of the Dark but very excellent and still original and catchy as hell!  This is my 'Dance of Death' of Final Frontier :)if that makes sense. The song is also 11 minutes but feels much shorter, which is a good thing in this case. Couldn't ask for more to the close of such a great album.

0060936223|5.0|This is perhaps the best memoir I have ever read. Certainly the best view of what it is like to be a struggling artist, and living with creative pursuits. It is also a window into a different world, one of long ago. That is New York City of the sixties and seventies. A time before electronic gadgets ruled people's lives, and one could exist without a credit card and scrape by eating with change and paying rent with a store job. Smith's recollections of the Chelsea Hotel and the artists of the time from Janis Joplin to Alan Ginsberg are inciteful and nuanced. They really transport the reader to that place and time.    Of course the core of the book was her magical relationship with Robert Mapplethorpe. Such an intense and valuable bond. The ending of the book left me emotionally raw. Like Smith I came to New York City as a young adult, though the early nineties when gentrification was well into getting into gear. However, everyone needs special people to survive. I met some magical people who helped me as well. So perhaps the book has extra meaning for me in that way.    However having a strong bond with someone else and sharing the struggles and joys of life with them is universal. So I would recommend this book to anyone. You don't have to be familiar with New York City or be a creative type or even a fan of Patti Smith or Robert Mapplethorpe. Though this book has made me a huge fan of both. Thank you Patti Smith for this wonderful gift of a book.

0007256531|5.0|Excellent book on how unconscious factors can shift our decisions.  Good statistical studies and (even humorous) examples of behavioral economics - a fun read (or listen to on audio book)!    Take away: most decisions we make are based on *relative comparisons*.  Altering the basis of comparisons and/or adding ambiguity can dramatically shift decisions.  For example, adding a high priced item (even if it's not expected to sell) will sway comparison prices to a higher value (we may not buy the highest priced item, but the second highest priced item doesn't look so bad).  Adding the word \\"free\\" to an item of the purchase adds an unconsciously strong pull to buy (everyone wants something for free, right?).  Particularly interesting is how our perception of happiness with a wife/husband/girlfriend/boyfriend can vary dramatically based simply on how the question is asked.

0385341008|5.0|For such a short, easy read, I learned a lot about the suffering of the English people during WWII, especially those on the little island of Guernsey, a British Crown Dependency. The book was not at all what I thought it would be. First, there is not one recipe in the whole of it. Second, although the story unfolds in a series of letters written between a young writer, Juliet, her publishers/editor, friends, and the members of the Society, the letters paint a lively and beautiful description of the events. Third, and most ashamedly, I had no idea that Guernsey even existed, let alone had been occupied by the Germans during World War II.<br /><br />The book was first and foremost entertaining. I would not have completed it if it had not been. But it was far more -- it was educational and gave me much food for thought about the extremes of humanity. I highly recommend it to those who haven't already read this wonderful book.

B0040QYROA|5.0|It's been many years since I last saw this film - and that was probably the \\"colorized\\" version with a pop score by Giorgio Moroder back in 1985 (just for curiosity sake, of course). When I heard that Kino was releasing this restored version I was really excited, as they are one of the top \\"classic film\\" reissuing companies. Upon watching this DVD (I don't have a blu-ray player and the contents on both the BD and the standard DVD are the same) I realized it was worth the wait. Pieces of the story that made no sense before were now brought into focus (no pun intended). And the score sounds great,<br /><br />Other reviews posted here will tell you more of the technical details, and I see quite a few comments about how the footage restored from the recently discovered 16mm print, should have been \\"cleaned up\\" before this release was made. My opinion is that such a task will take years and I may not be here to see it. At least now we have the best, and as complete, print one could hope for.<br /><br />The bonus materials are superb too. There is a full-length documentary on the making of and restoration of the film. Of course, I'd loved to have seen the actual lab work that was done. But I can't really gripe. The brief interview with the curator of the archive in Buenos Aires - where the missing footage was located - is like a detective story and certainly adds to understanding how this restoration came to be.<br /><br />On most DVDs, I prefer to watch the bonus features ( the now-requisite \\"Making of....\\" Featurette, deleted scenes, etc) after watching the feature. In the case of this release, I recommend that you watch the Bonuses (which are on a separate second disc) before settling in to watch the film. I think you'll appreciate the restoration even more.<br /><br />We all owe the folks at Kino a great deal of gratitude for making this film available so soon after the footage was located and putting together a class package at a price well below what Criterion would have listed it at.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\"have listed it at.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\"

B000J0UD94|4.0|It's a shame this movie didn't get much attention while it was out in theaters. [[ASIN:B000J0UD94 1492: Conquest of Paradise]] is a pretty good historical drama, especially considering it focuses on such a consequential and controversial event. Gérard Depardieu plays a great Columbus, combining the fervent hope of an explorer and weariness of middle-age. The settings are gorgeous and look very authentic. I love how they use mist in the forests to create an air of mystery. Vangelis' soundtrack also mixes classical Spanish themes with New Age. Overall, the film really gives viewers the sense that the characters are landing in a new world.     Unfortunately, the film hasn't aged all that well. The film and sound quality are fine, but certainly could use some updating. At times, the editing seems in a bit of a rush to move on to the next scene. It's a pretty dark movie so I had to brighten my TV screen just to watch it. The transitions are just a bit too abrupt for the drama of the moment.     [[ASIN:B000J0UD94 1492: Conquest of Paradise]] takes a fairly benign view of both Columbus and the American Indians. There is a bit of the de Montaigne trope about the American Indians being \\"noble savages.\\" savages. Columbus goes out of his way to prevent a confrontation between the Spanish and American Indians. In the film, Depardieu's Columbus exclaims to Queen Isabella that \\"nature is there God\\" and \\"there is no crime,\\" while in his historical journals he takes a more dismissive view. I guess this is better than the alternative of portraying them as primitive. Only the Spanish nobility come off as violent and barbaric. I don't think [[ASIN:B000J0UD94 1492: Conquest of Paradise]] goes so far as to whitewash history - it does portray the Spaniards as aggressors - but viewers should not take it as definitive historical fact.

0061998885|5.0|The initial part of this thriller is genuinely disturbing. A complete stranger accesses the personal information of his victims and then systematically destroys their lives until they take theirs. And whats really unsettling is to gather all this information is not that difficult.<br /><br />This is the situation facing Patrick Kenzie and his investigative partner Angela Gennaro who must locate the manipulator before he destroys their lives as well.<br /><br />This is a great thriller and Lehane is up with the very best writers in this genre ever. The plot is sophisticated and he has excellent characterisation.<br /><br />You are kept guessing until the last page. Lots of humour, very black humour, but it all fits in well with the story. An excellent read.
B000VMIILU|5.0|It's a shame this movie didn't get much attention while it was out in theaters. [[ASIN:B000J0UD94 1492: Conquest of Paradise]] is a pretty good historical drama, especially considering it focuses on such a consequential and controversial event. Gérard Depardieu plays a great Columbus, combining the fervent hope of an explorer and weariness of middle-age. The settings are gorgeous and look very authentic. I love how they use mist in the forests to create an air of mystery. Vangelis' soundtrack also mixes classical Spanish themes with New Age. Overall, the film really gives viewers the sense that the characters are landing in a new world.     Unfortunately, the film hasn't aged all that well. The film and sound quality are fine, but certainly could use some updating. At times, the editing seems in a bit of a rush to move on to the next scene.

With mum and dad seriously addicted to heroin the kids had a rather bizarre start to life, but it appears that have grown into pretty cool adults.<br /><br />This is great considering their old man is one of the most famous people who has ever lived and any upbringing in Keiths world is as about as far from normal life as you can get. But Keith does own a caravan (Winnabago) for family holidays,so hows that for normality, and he uses it.<br /><br />There are explanations regarding the rifts between him and Jagger, which are on going, but this is to be expected considering they have been together for nearly 50 years.<br /><br />To readers who understand the mechanics of playing guitar he relates how he gets his sound,its very simple, he just does it extremely well.<br /><br />We have a book here by a man who has through hard work early on in life, and continued hard work, has been able to live life completely on his terms. Something I am always envious of as there are so very few of us with a talent to be able to do this.<br /><br />Keith is a big reader,very well read, novels and history, all which gladdens my heart.<br /><br />And to top it off he even throws in his recipe for \\"bangers and mash\\".<br /><br />Keith Richards, a man if you have him as a friend, he is one for life, but cross him and hell will freeze over very quickly.which are on going, but this is to be expected considering they have been together for nearly 50 years.

B00122ORBI|5.0|Vangelis' New Age style doesn't seem like a good fit for an epic drama like Columbus' voyage to the New World, but it works. I think the darker themes are better. The tracks from Old World Spain are particularly good, mixing \\"guitar\\" in. A must for Vangelis fans.
0586045449|5.0|Anthony Burgess includes this novel as one of his 99 best English novels written since 1930 and is absolutely correct to do so.<br /><br />It is the story a RAF Bomber Squadron and their German opposition over a 24 hour period. From the planning of a 700 plane attack on Germany until they land again back at their squadrons.<br /><br />It makes for a very harrowing read and it in no way glorifies war. It accentuates the exceptional bravery of those involved but it lays out for all to see the utter waste that war is.<br /><br />I didn't realise how young the pilots in WW2 were, you had 23 year olds captaining Lancaster Bombers with 18 year old crewmen and 21 year old Germans trying to shoot them down. Thousands of these young men died. When they got hit by a canon round, they didn't just fall down dead with a neat little hole in them, they vaporised, suffered horrendous burns, all terrible stuff.<br /><br />It is a great read and as it was first published in 1970, I wondered why it had not had the acclaim that other anti-war novels have garnered. My theory is that Deighton was primarily known for his spy thrillers at the time. It deserves to be a very famous book.<br /><br />It is a wonderful book, without the humour and cynicism of \\"Catch 22\\" but the message is the same.

0307358666|1.0|After the success of \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" and its sequels, you just knew some lazy agent would troll Scandinavia in an attempt to uncover the next Stieg Larsson.<br /><br />Some lazy agent did and some lazy publisher has then punted on Jo Nesbo and his novel \\"The Snowman\\". This is dreadful, I am still giving myself uppercuts because I persevered and finished it.<br /><br />The author is a musician, songwriter and an economist!!!!!!!!!!! and unfortunately he writes cliched poor crime novels. The cop is alcoholic with authority issues (aren't they all?), there is constant referal to songs and lyrics,(Rankin did it much better years ago). He has of course the estranged girlfriend who secretly wants him back and on and on and on and on.<br /><br />The plot has holes the size of third world debt and to make things even worse it goes on for 550 ludicrous pages.<br /><br />It is also translated and the translation just clunks - even though I admire anyone who is multi lingual the translator does this no favours at all, and it needs every bit of assistance that is out there.<br /><br />I am aware Scandinavia is very socialist in its governance so the only conclusion I can draw is that authors are paid by the word, anyway, they obviously don't seem bother with little things like editors.<br /><br />Save your money.

Perhaps if our hero, Doc Sportello, had been a bit straighter he may have sorted this very ordinary plot out quicker than the 366 pages it takes him.<br /><br />Its a strange book set in about 1970. Why its set there I do not know,and there is no clue.<br /><br />The constant references to the pop icons of the era - i.e Ginger and others from Gilligans Island -are just plain annoying. My age group may remember this stuff but to most younger people none of the television, music or movies constantly referred are well enough known to have any meaning.<br /><br />At the end of the book, after many digressions, all we have is a story about heroin and bad guys. with Doc Sportello getting his chick back!<br /><br />I don't know if Mr. Pynchon imbibes but it gives the impression of being written by a stoned person. Things start up all the time but never go anywhere.<br /><br />This purchase wasn't a complete waste of $34 but close, a few laughs saved it from getting packed straight off to the church jumble sale.
B000002LRX|5.0|I bought this album on tape when it first came out, and I was hooked immediately.  It's one of the few I still listen to after all these years.  One of the reasons for it has to be that almost all the songs on it are great.  There is no filler to appease record company execs.  There's no mold that it's supposed to fit.  It's all original and written like they had nothing to lose or gain, but just for the love of making music.  Patten's voice is also perfect for this style.

Smith as a poet and Mapplethorpe as an artist. Then Mapplethorpe contracts AIDS and dies as a 42 year old. Smith carries on and is presently releasing some of her best music as a 63 year old and counting.<br /><br />The book is set between 1968 and 1980 with a introduction and closing chapter set around the death of Mapplethorpe.<br /><br />She tells about the scene in New York in the early 70's and the rise of what would become the punk scene there as it concerned her and running parallel with this is Mapplethorpe's route to fame, which was sped up by his mentor and lover Sam Wagstaff.<br /><br />This is more Smith's story obviously but for a 10 year period their two lives were totally entwined so there justification in her calling the book their story- the story of two 20 year old's forging their way in the world.<br /><br />Its an interesting read, especially concerning the New York music scene. It reads like a monologue,( the third chapter runs 122 pages) it might be me but it has a talked to tape feel about it and then transcribed. This isn't a negative just the feel of the book.<br /><br />There is a very good biography on Mapplethorpe- Mapplethorpe by Patricia Morrisroe- published in 1995 which is an excellent companion to this book
B004G6009K|5.0|All my life I have been a fan of Walt Disney classics and this is by far my favorite movie ever    But I agree with some of the reviewers... I almost didn't watch this movie at the Theaters for lack of good advertisement    I was surprised at all levels, it is now my favorite movie EVER!    But there is a deeper truth in the movie, a painful one that any immature parent will not be able to stand    The truth that well-intention parents sometimes smother the growth and liberty of their children    \\"Mother knows best\\" is one of the greatest lines in the movie, from an evil person who cares more for herself than from her \\"daughter\\"    Parents will usually not understand the damage they inflict to their own children with the kind of behavior is portrayed in the evil-step mother in the movie, but indeed is a common human flaw from most parents    If you have the courage to look within your soul and see your own psychological blind spots, this is the movie that will help you grow as a parent and will help your children have the courage to be a true independent human adult    Best of life to all of you    Nacho Nava  Bay Area   California  USA
0345505387|4.0|Yes, it's a graphic novel, which means more of the story is told with pictures, and less with words.  Be aware that \\"The Exile\\" is not \\"Outlander\\" and does not follow the entire timeline of \\"Outlander.\\"  The graphic novel ends long before \\"Outlander\\" does.      While I enjoyed seeing images of Jamie, Claire, Black Jack and other characters I know from the Outlander series, I could have done without an additional subplot involving new characters.  It just confuses the story.    Bottom line, if you love the Outlander series and like graphic novels, buy it.  If you don't like graphic novels, stick to reading the books.  If you love \\"Outlander\\" and have never read a graphic novel before, this might be a good one for you.
0307408833|2.0|I recently checked this out from the library, and as the library owns the first edition the book was labeled gluten free.  I know this was updated in the second edition to be (mostly) gluten free, but I find this to be unforgivably dangerous as not everyone might be aware of the update.  There is also no discussion of making sure the rice milk you use is gluten free, as many brands are not.  The book itself is fun to look through, and I loved the natural food coloring section.  The book was much too self-congratulatory for my taste (all of the celebrity testimonials and talk of lines around the corner).  Full disclosure, due to my above stated dislikes and all of the negative reviews here I didn't have any desire to try any of the recipes.  I much prefer the Blackbird Bakery Gluten free and Cooking for Isaiah cookbooks.  It sounds like the recipes she uses in the bakery itself are excellent so I'll be sure to make a stop when I'm in New York, but I'm glad I got this from the library prior to buying it.

B0000844I8|5.0|Despite the fact that I'm a Richard Dean Anderson fan, and have watched all the Stargate episodes he was in on tv, when they finally appeared on the Sci Fi channel, I really enjoyed watching this movie with Kurt Russell and James Spader. I have never watched it before, so I checked it out at our library. I really enjoyed watching it. In fact, after watching this movie, the tv show made more sense. The movie filled in the gaps about why Daniel stayed on Abydos, and why Jack went to that planet, and ended up blowing up RA and his ship. After getting this movie for Christmas, I watched it again. I loved the special features and the commentary too. Those were really good. And the movie itself was very good too. Lots of good special effects, and the acting was very good too. Kurt being a \\"veteran actor\\" brought a lot to the Jack O'Neil character. I'm still an RDA fan, and I really loved Richard's interpretation of O'Neill. I have to admit, that I agree with Richard. It was better that O'Neill had a sense of humor. It made the show more humorous, and fun to watch. But I would recommend this movie to anyone. Good production, and good storyline, and good acting too.

0316098337|2.0|\\"Room\\" is a quick read that probably doesn't warrant much textual analysis or introspective discussion.<br /><br />It is evident that the author borrowed heavily from recent sensational discoveries of abducted sex slaves in creating this storyline, but in \\"Old Nick's\\" own words, the situation of the lead character and her son in this fictional account doesn't seem quite as austere and exploitive as its source material, eg. a skylight, central air, sanitation, and a fairly consistent and humane delivery of food and other necessities, including \\"Sundaytreats\\". As narrated by the five year old child who had never known any other existence, and in fact was horrified by the prospect of living \\"Outside\\", it just didn't seem that I was able to feel as anguished for the main character as I should have. Because the narrator was only five year old, he couldn't provide a full account of what his mother's captivity and slavery had stolen from her. I give the author props for attempting this challenging perspective, but I felt that it didn't quite work as well as I had hoped it would.<br /><br />I was hoping we'd get to see \\"Ma\\" face her abductor in court. After the escape, it didn't seem like much else happened that was more than marginally interesting. It was just really sad.<br /><br />A worthy concept for a novel, surely, and perhaps in the hands of a more deft or mature author, it would have been more credible and memorable.

B00428ZRFE|1.0|I'm an experienced woman, but I think the disturbing lyrics of this CD out weigh the musical benefits. Rhianna is a lovely young woman who everybody knows was physically abused by a former boyfriend. Is it wise of her to sing a song about S & M? I realize that's an accepted form of sex for some people, as long as it's mutual. But does Rhianna get that some young people may listen to her song and think it's okay to really hurt someone? I cringe thinking of young girls who will go along with just about anything to get or keep a guy's attention. And I can see how young men may find the lyrics sexually exciting and think that's what girls really want. NOT. I bought the CD because I loved one song, and was shocked when I listened to the whole thing. It's a very poor example of male/female relationships, and shows how confused Rhianna is about it. She consistently dresses up like a cheap whore, and then sings about liking to be hurt during sex. This isn't a good role model for young girls. I've thrown the CD in the trash where it belongs.
0316920045|2.0|I made it to page 800 before I decided I was sick of this book. He's brilliant, yeah, and he never lets you forget it -- but God, he just goes on. I found the tennis academy sections borderline unreadable, and for the last 300 pages or so before stopping I was so tired of how every character needs some grotesque quirk, some ridiculous deformity or absurd method of \\"demapping\\" her/himself. (I like that term, though.) I just wanted him to stop the circus for a while and follow some of the absurdity through, develop a few points. He does that in a few places, especially with Gately in the halfway house, and in those moments he manages to be funny, mind-boggling, and moving all at once. But ultimately it's just not worth the slog. His essays are terrific, and I like what I've read of his short fiction. In those genres he gets the same basic points across that he's dealing with in Infinite Jest, but without the piles and piles of chaff.
B002ZG99CC|5.0|Good movie!
B002ZG981E|2.0|This movie was touted to be a thinking man's movie, that dreams are a perturbation of a higher reality. It's suppose make you question and beg the fabric of the world we live in, that we perceive, and to question if your current life is a dream. Plaster Inception with many special effects and explosions, this flick is bound to win many awards. It has that blockbuster type of production and feel to it.     But these factors failed for the following reasons: 1) The storyline is too confusion, the \\"who, what, where, and when\\" is not obvious; 2) Too many dream sequences and levels down; 3) Suffers from poor character development (reminds me of Italian Job); 4) That portable dream machine device and wiring is a joke; and 5) The unconventional running length of 2 ½ hrs is overwhelmingly a dragging work still in progress of editing.     A movie's storyline should contain all the elements/points needed for a smooth understanding. Only later when I read about the synopsis did I connect the dots. But any movie should not require \\"homework\\" but should appeal to \\"average Joe\\" movie goers. A great movie is one that leaves you still thinking days later. I was lost here after 20 min.     This movie could easily be 5 star by doing the following: 1) Don't hide the concepts, but make the driving force the story itself, and adventurous, for example classics like Star Wars, or Wizard of Oz. 2) Make dreams something we can ALL relate to (more realistic) by dumping the multi-layering aspect.  One level down is good enough.  3) Cut out some useless scenes, make it 1 ½ hrs, but keep the special effects.    As far as the product, 3 discs are encased in a standard sized blu ray case to save space. On the cover slip (a 3D hologram, though this is not a 3D movie) says, \\"digital copy.\\" This product should NOT advertise \\"digital copy\\" (misleading), since it's actually \\"digital download.\\" Like many other reviewers here, I was disappointed to find a digital copy missing from my purchase. Likewise, anyone would be disappointed too, if the blu ray disc were missing inside the case, but instead, a paper containing instructions on how to download the movie itself online. Worse yet, there's an expiration date (May 6, 2011) on the download.     Inception had too much hype and expectations leading to letdown. Concept is nothing new here. Better thinking man's movie in the dream/reality genre I recommend are The Matrix, Truman Show, and Vanilla Sky.        ADDENDUM UPDATE 02/10/11    I watched Inception a second time and, whala!  The pieces of the puzzle fell into place.  I went from totally confused to totally the light bulb duh effect.    If Inception left you with blanks, I STONGLY URGE you to watch Inception once more.  Confusing details will be clarified.  I think the movie was purposely made to mystify you at first, only to let the wow factor discharge with subsequent viewings.  I'm sure writer/director Christopher Nolan craftily planned this, intentionally placing scenes in the beginning left unexplained, knowing that inquisitive diehards will take a revelation the next time around.    PLOT & CONCEPT OF THE MOVIE    The storyline is actually pretty simple.  Don't let that confuse you.  I will not inundate you with the plot details, as you'll read it elsewhere for easy explanation.  Actually, I'll place the plain framework synopsis in the comment entry section.  The what, who, why, when, how will be clarified.  Otherwise, let me go into the meat of this movie.      Depending on how you view it, the concept of the movie as intended by the author C. Nolan is a bit more challenging, which my review here will address.  The premise of the movie is not that obvious, but when understood in the context of psychology, is quite deep.  And the significance of this movie's meaning is philosophical and the psyche blowing implications are staggeringly mind boggling as the concept are a mouthful to take in.  Hopefully I'll bridge some gap here.    ONLY IN HOLLYWOOD, WITH AN INGENIOUS THINKER, WRITER, AND DIRECTOR.    Though unique and original in its own way, Inception does follow suit with the other analogous mind-boggling concept movies that my further review is in allusion to encompass et al., not limiting to Inception.  That is to say my references to these mind twisting ambition are likewise, deduced aspiration similar in genre to movies/TV of such, The Matrix, Vanilla Sky, Truman Show, Tru Calling (TV), and The Adjustment Bureau (TBA, March 4th release).    You can see there's a multitude of mind twisting movies.  They're nothing new.  They are to show what could be beyond, outside the box, which you never notice on your daily life's routine basis.  Like nothing can substitute the thrill of a coaster ride, it does take the creation by means of Hollywood movies and a distinctive writer/director to visually portray that outer (or inner) world beyond your perception, and likewise important, an audience who's equally open to interpret such ideas with the current methodology understanding process of science, philosophy, and existentialism.    The following concepts or conclusion can be ascertained from the information provided by the story line and that the writer Nolan would like to audience to establish.  That dreams are as authentic as reality to the point for you to question, like Cobb & Mal did, if your current awaken reality state is actually a dream state?   And, as I will also describe how Inception is precisely and surprisingly consistent with the way we humans dream.  In addition, the concepts in Inception are shocking consistent w/ physics, philosophy, ideology, and theology.  (Don't assume Nolan didn't do his homework.  He warps all the bases for your mind). By consistent, I mean the following:    METAPHYSICAL IMPLICATIONS     It is readily taken for granted; your thinking process is independent.  But if there's an external controller, how would you ever know it right?    INCEPTOR / INCEPTEE    Hence, the first and principal foremost, insight is that the inceptee (the one being incepted, in this case Robert Fischer, the corporate heir and the target of Leonardo DiCaprio's dreamscape heist, played by Cillian Murphy), never realizes it.  By the same token, like Fischer, we are probably subjected to inception without a clue.  Nolan is showing that in the real world, the inceptee could be anyone, including you.      In Vanilla Sky, David Aames (Tom Cruise) was trapped in a simulation unaware, and evidently tries vehemently to break away.  Matrix ccomputer programmer Thomas A. Anderson (Keanu Reeves) character is encased in the Matrix.  Tru calling TV where we never perceive the outer framework of our normal day to day perception, but Tru Davies (Eliza Dushku) could in that other dimension.  Likewise, Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) never realized he was being watched by thousands.  In addition, Truman Show's architect designed the set and entire city and sky, stars, was framed, and what is believed by Truman, the heavens as well.  The Adjustment Bureau, {taken from the trailer, \\"Life is a series of events.  This man (Matt Damon).  This glance.  The moments all happen according to plan.  This plan, monitored by the bureau who run the world, behind the curtain you never knew existed.\\"}    Now the inception schemes in the movies Inception and Vanilla Sky may not be as quickly revealed compared to as in Matrix or Truman Show, or as obvious as in Tru Calling.  That's what leaves the art, mystery, attention focus span, and suspense more daunting in Inception.  See, you have to figure it out yourself before the answer to the puzzle is revealed, or before you're confused, or have to re-watch it again.    CONTROLLERS / CONTROLEE    -The external controllers are as follows:     -Inception: Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his dream team, including Ariadne (Ellen Page), a young student architect tasked with designing the labyrinth of the dream landscapes.  -Truman Show: the entire cast (except Truman), including Christof (Ed Harris), the creator AKA \\"god.\\"  -Matrix: it's Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and the Matrix itself.  -Vanilla Sky, it's an unnamed man (Noah Taylor), and the court psychologist Dr. Curtis McCabe (Kurt Russell).  -Tru Calling: it's Tru Davies (Eliza Dushku), and an unknown force (who gave Tru her calling ability).  Also, her father Richard Davies (Cotter Smith), and Jack Harper (Jason Priestley) as the counterintuitive force.   -The Adjustment Bureau: the adjustment bureau team.    The controllee are as follows:     -Inception: it's Robert Fischer.    -Truman Show: it's Truman Burbank.    -Matrix: it's Keanu Reeves.    -Vanilla Sky: it's Tom Cruise.   -Tru Calling: it's those saying, \\"Help me!\\"  And in your life, well, you!  -The Adjustment Bureau: David (Matt Damon).      Lets look at some scientific data on how this may be true this moment, how inception and movies like these are in fact very consistent w/ pure science.      Please check back.  I'm finishing / editing the rest of this review to publish soon.
074325144X|5.0|ChiRunning helped me look at my running in a whole new way. It has improved my technique, but probably more importantly it has stimulated my motivation, improved my entire running program, given me tools and techniques to use in other areas of my life. Thank you, Danny Dreyer, for an informative, entertaining book on ChiRunning and ChiLiving!
B000YABIQ6|5.0|After hearing people talk about this show for a long time now, I saw it offered at Costco for $11.99 each (season 1 and season 2), I  decided to purchase. All I can say is WOW, what a show, I could not stop watching. The acting is 1st rate and the stories are riveting.    To me being 50 years old, i always thought the 60's was a much less complicated time, more family oriented, simpler and people generally had better morals. If this show is any indication as to how it really was, then perhaps nothing ever really changes. The  only thing that really pisses me off about that time was the dismissive way men treated women, and perhaps they still do but the  men today have to be much less overt about it.    If you are thinking of buying this, do it!!!!
B00454U1NS|4.0|In my opinion, Pink is, by far, the greatest current American pop star. Buying a Greatest Hits package of an artist you're already a big fan of can be redundant, since you probably have most of the songs already, but since this was given to me as a gift, it's given me the chance to listen to all of Ms. Moore's radio hits, and it makes me have even more respect for how far she's come.<br /><br />I'm glad there's only one song, \\"There You Go\\", from Pink's first album, because when you hear her earlier music now, it's obvious how uncomfortable and limiting the sound was for her. The songs from her second album, the pop-rock-girl-power autobiography \\"Missundaztood,\\" are light years ahead of the first album, and really begin to show Pink's personality, range, emotional vulnerability, and energy. Her third album, the underrated \\"Try This\\" perhaps ventured too far away from radio-friendly sounds, and so unfortunately only \\"Trouble\\" appears on this collection. But her next album, \\"I'm Not Dead\\", has a variety of tracks present, including \\"Dear Mr. President\\" which is possibly the most bold and provocatively political song attempted by a maintream pop star in years. The album includes several tracks from Pink's last album, \\"Funhouse\\", which was the most mature album of her career. Songs like \\"Sober\\" and \\"Please Don't Leave Me\\" show Pink's ability to write pop hooks while still staying true to the rock-blues-folk hybrid that is clearly her true passion. The album ends with two new tracks, including the wonderful \\"Raise Your Glass,\\" an anthem for all the underdogs everywhere, from pop's most fascinating, hardworking, and unstoppable underdog herself.<br /><br />But since I'm a true blood Pink fan, I'd like to offer my own personal list of my favorite Pink songs from over the years (some of which were hits and some not):<br /><br />1. Get The Party Started (Missundaztood)<br />2. 18 Wheeler (Missundaztood)<br />3. Numb (Missundaztood)<br />4. Feel Good Time (From Charlie's Angels II)<br />5. God is a DJ (Try This)<br />6. Oh My God (Try This)<br />7. Long Way to Happy (I'm Not Dead)<br />8. I'm Not Dead (I'm Not Dead)<br />9. 'Cuz I Can (I'm Not Dead)<br />10. U + Ur Hand (I'm Not Dead)<br />11. Heartbreaker (B-side for I'm Not Dead)<br />12. Sober (Funhouse)<br />13. Please Don't Leave Me(Funhouse)<br />14. Bad Influence (Funhouse)<br />15. It's All Your Fault (Funhouse)<br />16. Raise Your Glass6. Oh My God (Try This)  7. Long Way to Happy (I'm Not Dead)  8. I'm Not Dead (I'm Not Dead)  9. 'Cuz I Can (I'm Not Dead)  10. U + Ur Hand (I'm Not Dead)  11. Heartbreaker (B-side for I'm Not Dead)  12. Sober (Funhouse)  13. Please Don't Leave Me(Funhouse)  14. Bad Influence (Funhouse)  15. It's All Your Fault (Funhouse)  16. Raise Your Glass
B0001O3YD0|4.0|So much fun and as a sci fi junky, IMHO, top notch!<br /><br />Like Radja Chadna's review on the main page, I dont know how I missed this. I was living with 6 people in a crazy apt in Manhattan during 2000. We were all film students, but never went to the movies, were too busy I guess forgetting what it was to be alive. I dont remember a trailer for this, no idea who Vin Diesel was randomly picked this up on a friends advice because he said it was (more or less) an extension to Charlie Sheen's 'The Arrival'<br /><br />I wish I had seen this in theaters. Just epic sci fi. Characters that were easily enjoyable, that you cared about, the switching of the boy/girl thing was very well done, the story had me hanging on from jump street. There is so much here, a combo of a little Dune and The Descent, the lighting was really good even in the dark scenes and I was hooked baby, just really stellar stuff. The scene of the ringed Saturn type planet eclipsing the planet as they drove by, was so magical. The dude from Platoon, (interestingly with Charlie Sheen), as the Imam was a good mix of balance. The scene when the flying smaller bat things, went down the long hole and you can peer in to see all the bones from the scientist there that locked themselves in and forget their was an opening 22 years earlier or whatever, man just so well done. There are touches of so many memories from other films that remind me a bit of this, like I said: Dune, The Cave (still thought it was cool), The Descent, Duncan Jones Moon, hahha dunno, all just came to mind.<br /><br />What Vin lacks in his acting ability, he makes up for with a pretty decent ensemble cast, that just takes the film along the way where you never lose interest and really are on the edge of your seat. Dig in.<br /><br />I love how a film can be lost for years from your sight, and then something like this comes along that you overlooked and it can turn your whole world onto a series like Riddick, hoping that Vin will step away from the $$$ that is Fast and Furious for a bit, and concentrate on his favorite character for perhaps another two Riddick fliks with David Twowy.<br /><br />Just so much fun!Furious for a bit, and concentrate on his favorite character for perhaps another two Riddick fliks with David Twowy.    Just so much fun!
B000ATQYT2|5.0|I adore the Muppets and their non politically correct humor.  This is the classic Christmas Carol with a muppets twist.  Out takes are hysterical, and Kermit is quite the smartie if you don't choose something in a timely manner from the menu.
B000LGZHDS|5.0|Bought for my grandson... he loves GARY!!!!!!!! Wish it came in a larger size... but really durable... he carries it everywhere!!
B0044430H8|5.0|The movie held my attention (although the the endless depositions did get somewhat tedious). It is good to have read a bit about the real Zuckerberg before seeing it. The music is something else. It is powerful new music. Among the most exciting pieces of music I have ever heard. Listen intently. It will command your attention and thrill your emotions.
B0015HOFZI|1.0|I tried to get this to work for 2 hours before I called Sony. I was told the Sony PS-LX300usb is not compatible with Windows 7 and there are no plans to make it compatible. I have a friend who has one and he loves it so I figured I would get the same thing. When I told him he better get all his Lp's recorded before he needs a new computer he was very upset. I would not buy this product even if I had Windows XP for that reason. Amazon was very good about the return.
B003H9MSPG|4.0|My 5 year old loves his Nerf guns, and I love them as they don't damage my walls! This gun is the easiest for him to cock, which was surprising because of its size.    Amazon's sale price just before Christmas was unbelievable, close to half off the retail price I had seen everywhere.
0451169514|4.0|I was hesitant to read this book for 2 reasons; 1. The movie sucked and 2. because I dont particularly care for clowns.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not scared of them, they just make me a little uncomfortable; something about those plastered on smiles.  Anyway, this book was a pleasant suprise.  I read it a nights, which wasn't the best idea beacuse then I had a little trouble getting to sleep! ha!  Still, very much a page-turner. Worth the read for sure. Even the ending, which was the most disappointing in the movie and I was kinda worried about because King does tend to have some trouble with endings, was pretty good.
B001E45XT4|5.0|This Gaming headset is my best headset yet. The best price for a headset like this, I received the headset with really fast shipping. I came, i connected it into my audio and microphone jack and it works flawlessly. The microphone quality is flawless. The sound quality is flawless. Nothing else you can ask for. The bass is just great. The only problem is if you wear it for 2-3 hours it will get hot in there. Otherwise its a great headset. If Bose made gaming headsets then it will be comparable to this. HIGHLY recommended to people that dont wanna spend alot for a headset.
B004AKCME8|5.0|Seems like this movie is extremely downplayed compared to some others.  Me and my family found this to be an amazing adventure for all ages.  And now it's inspired us to start the books!!
6304711891|5.0|What an outstanding movie! Awesome action, great storyline and an amazing score make this movie one of the best action movies I have ever seen! Definately reccomended to anyone who likes action movies or movies in general!
0312600844|3.0|Guess Oprah and I have different taste in Books  it was OK but not really worth the time to read when I could have   been reading something I really liked!
B00466H3DG|5.0|My favorite movie of all time. Every element you could want. Great writing. Inspired direction. Stellar cast (Carrey, Winslet, Wilkinson, Wood, Dunst, Ruffalo, and even a cameo by mo-fuggin David Cross!). A believable, richly-constructed love story. Some pot smoking. A lot of spacey mind-bending visual flair (that manages to not be intrusive in that eye-rolling Oliver Stone way as it actually serves the script). Ultimately, life-affirming but equally sad. Great music by Beck and others. Superb in every conceivable way. This is the defining film of the 2000s and an endless source of inspiration and imagination. It looks great on Blu-Ray to boot! Brilliant.
B002ZG97EC|4.0|Great movie with lots of subtle adult humor and references.  I don't have a blu-ray player yet so I was very disappointed that we could not see the 3 mini-movies.
B000UVT3OI|5.0|I looked high and low for this cd at all the record stores. I finally found it here at a great price with a prompt delivery would recommend this cd to anyone that is a garth fan.
B002N1AERI|5.0|-In my opinion, Epica just gets better each year. Vocally, there are very few bands that can boast of the quallities brought to the table by the red-headed front woman Simone. Her stage presents, charisma, and overall style of singing has easilly ranked her the best female vocalist in metal by my book. (besides Tarja of corse.) All that aside, they really did somthing unique, taking the symphonic aspects of nightwish, and combinding them with the Death metal elements installed by mark. Over the years they have improved in song-writing skills, and, despite a few flaws, I consider this to be their best release. Following close behind would be 'Consign to Oblivion.' This album is freakin' HEAVY. Simone and mark have never sounded better! Simone graces this work with pure and versitile vocals, combinding some elements of classical, jazz, and rock/pop in her singing technique.Her range seems to be wider than before, and the high notes come out pure as gold. Absolutly beatifull. As for mark, I feel like he shines out alot on this album. His growling has never been up to par with some of the other growlers such as Mikael Adkerfeldt or paul kuhr, But they really have improved. I here alot of whining about it, and that annoys me. I will agree that his vocals were crappy on the debut, but now the've improved, greatly complimenting the angelic vocals of simone in demonic harmony... like a war in heaven. This ain't a radio-freindly band. Get used to it! The tracks on this album all shine out in their own way. Some better than others. This time around, I can detect a strong Opeth influence, what with the progressive stuff.I can even hear a bit of Dimmu Borgierish elements on certain passages, which I think is pretty cool! I kinda love it actually. This band has produced a peice of art that ranges from lovly balads such as 'Tides of Time', to the headbanger tunes like 'Martyr of the free world.'   Is this album perfect? If it isn't perfect, it's pretty close to it! I used to laugh at their lyrics back when they made 'The Phantom Agony.' On this album, they follow the same approach, and there are a few cheesy passages here and there, but they are doing it in a way so that it seems less like a freakin' sermon, and more like genuine poetry.I can't lie though, there are a few brief occasions when I feel like I'm being educated in the philosophy of quantum physics, but hey! It's better than the braindead slasher stuff. Me, I'm all for deep and thoughtfull lyrics, and I have to give these guys props for putting so much time into their writing. They appear to be written by Simone for the most part, with Mark doing a few as well. I don't know if they can follow this release with a worthy proceder, but I will remain optimistic, in hopes that Epica still has room for more great music. Now go buy it!
0312330537|1.0|A self promotional novel by a drug addict/criminal.  This 920 page novel befits the authors oversized ego.  After some consideration I think the novel was not worth reading.
B0045NXMJE|5.0|Delightful visual treasure with a message, as only Jean-Pierre Jeunet can deliver.  Like a collaboration between Fellini and Chaplin.
B002ZG997C|3.0|It was ok for me I love Denzel but this did not wow me I don't want to give anything away because everybody before me gave brief or long description of the movie when I found out out what the book was  I was saying to myself are you serious this is what they were fighting for for power but I guess it would make sense but don't get me wrong it's still watchable but for me personally it was just ok.
B0021L8V0M|5.0|I HAVE SEEN THIS MOVIE AND IT IS THE BEST YET AND HAS A VERY GOOD BUT STRANGE TWIST TO THE MOVIE ITSELF , I CAN HARDLY WAIT FOR THE SECOND HALF TO COME OUT IN THEATRS. I HOPE SHE GETS A OSCAR FOR BEST ACTRESS FORTHIS MOVIE , IF SHE HASNT ALREADY. BELIVE ME SHE DESERVES IT SHE IS AN AWESOME ACTRESS.

B0046HAKY4|5.0|Got the book in great condition. Both my son and all that read it love the book. Get the hardcover, it's a book you'll want to pass on. Hope there's more grufalo,s around the deep dark wood
030746363X|5.0|As a big fan of The 4-Hour Workweek (cut 10+ hours off my workweek with little effort)I was thrilled to learn that Tim Ferriss had written The 4-Hour Body (4HB). 4HB is a very interesting book that approaches common self help goals (like weight loss) from a perspective you've not seen thus far. As hoped, it is written with the typical Tim Ferriss style which is basically like talking to a friend. You will not regret buying this book (so far I have hardback & e-book) and you will achieve results easier than you ever have before.
B003Q6D2BE|5.0|A totally fun, action-packed 2 hours. The whole cast is fantastic and John Malkovich's special brand of crazy is awesome to watch. Highly recommended!
B000MRAAJM|5.0|We have always loved this series and recently got the BluRay edition.  The detail is stunning, and our two little ones completely immerse themselves when we turn it on.  It's something the entire family can watch, enjoy, and learn together with.
1439107955|5.0|As a practicising oncologist, Siddharta Mukherjee is all a patient could wish for; he's bright, well-trained, and committed to his patients. As an author, he's all a reader could wish for; he writes with precision, clarity, and great insight. He has written this book the way Willie Mays played center field--with such grace and elegance that it's easy to forget what a challenge it must have been.       Over the years, I've read several thousand books. I've given almost all of them to a friend or a library. With some guilt, I've kept about two dozen special books for myself. I'm keeping this one.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|i loved this book. The idea of living through that situation and how you would deal with it is really an eye opener.
B000JLSLZQ|1.0|THE BLUE RAY IS FINE, SPECTACULAR IF YOU ARE A FAN. MY WIFE AND I CAUGHT THE PREMIERE IN DC A FEW YEARS AGO. WANTED THE BLU-RAY FOR HER FOR XMAS AND ORDERED WITH PLENTY OF TIME AND IT STILL SHOWED UP AFTER XMAS.     THAT WAS UNDERSTANDABLE BUT WHEN I NOTIFIED AMAZON ABOUT (THIS WAS A XMAS PRESENT..HINT HINT) THEIR ADVICE WAS \\"SEE IF IT SHOWS UP AND THEN CONTACT US!\\"    PISS POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE, NO TRACKING INFO, NO CORRESPONDENCE! LAST ORDER I MAKE FROM AMAZON!!!
B004B8DH98|3.0|Somewhat entertaining and interesting.  Very European style movie, with European actors other than Clooney.  Simple music when there was music.  The ending was predictable, but I found myself hoping I would be wrong.  Some very attractive women in it and in the nude some too.  It is worth a rent.
B001TH8UUA|5.0|Ordered this HDMI cable before xmas to go with my new Roku player.  Worked just like it was suppose to.  Ended up ordering 3 more as the price was great!
B003Z9Q4WG|5.0|Since acquiring my Symphony Edition box a few weeks ago, I have listened to over half of the 60 CDs. The packaging of the 60 CDs within an LP-style box is peculiar and somewhat clumsy for accessing a specific CD in the box, but the overall excellence of the recordings far offsets this annoyance.    Among the performances which I have listened to more than once, out of sheer enjoyment, include the four Brahms symphonies (better readings than I had remembered), the Haydn \\"Paris\\" symphonies, Prokofiev's symphonies 1 and 5, Mahler's Symphony No. 1...I could go on and on, but I have really spent a lot of quality time listening to these disks. Nothing I've listened to has come across as dull, routine or boring, although there are some individual pieces where I still prefer other recorded interpretations.     I owned a few of these recordings in previous Bernstein Century, Royal Edition or Great Performances CD incarnations. Listening closely on headphones, I found the Mahler Symphonies 4 and 7 seem to have a somewhat fresher, more immediate sound than the Bernstein Century issues.  Curiously, the Nielsen Symphonies 3 & 5 had somewhat different tonal balances than on the Royal Edition - hard to describe, primarily a somewhat smaller soundstage.  The Shostakovich Symphony 5 here sounds more acoustically balanced than the somewhat shrill, treble-focused CBS Great Performances version.     I'd be very interested at how other buyers of this set have assessed the audio mastering compared with prior CD or LP issues. At this very affordable price point, the overall audio quality has exceeded my expectations and the musical performances have been a great source of joy and insight.    Although I am awarding five stars because this set is truly impressive overall, I was annoyed that one of my disks (Beethoven's Symphony No. 9) exhibited a manufacturing defect - the music skips badly during the final movement. Has Sony's CD manufacturing quality control been compromised?
0307454541|2.0|I purchased the books because they were on the bestseller list.  The books weren't for me.  They are depressing, they didn't hold my interest, and as I was reading them I didn't look forward to continuing the read.  I can definitely see why other people liked it, but everyone likes different things and this just isn't for everyone.
0805091742|4.0|This book is NOT a manual on how to create and/or use checklists. Don't read it if you are into the \\"improve your life in 10 easy steps\\" type of reading. It's rather an entertaining, brilliantly written book about complexity, and how to deal with complexity. I didn't learn how to do checklists, but this book did make me think about how I manage complexity in my professional life, and what I could do better - without spoon-feeding me the answers. If I would have one little critique, it would be that I would have enjoyed reading more examples from outside the medical world. Nevertheless, I'd recommend it to anyone who has a complicated job!
B00076NYFK|5.0|Imo status quo had was at their peak during this period. They had been a cool psych rock/pop outfit with their first two discs from 68 and 69 and then in 1970 became a boogie hard rockin machine! This was in that mode but perhaps a little more with a pop edge , still this is not like their weaker period 1986-2000. ( which still had some cool songs but no great discs imo. This one had a few top hits like usual and was as enjoyable as their last release 'rocking all over the world' but it's just not as 100% solid perhaps. Still this hasn't a bad song on it if you are a quo fan or hard rock fan who likes a slight pop edge on  some songs.  Which I am , so that's good. However this isn't quite as good as 'whatever you want' or their previous releases, which are even better than this one. That being said this is still five star quo that rocked alot of people through 1978 and it is in their strongest period of music so grab the remaster , it's a better version for sure. (this one).
0316077054|3.0|This is shaping up to be a trilogy, which makes Beautiful Darkness the middle - with the accompanying \\"middle child syndrome.\\"  There is a fine line between teen angst and whining, and sadly, this installment crosses it.  It's natural that Lena and Ethan would be upset and changed by the events at the conclusion of book one, in particular the death of Macon. I think the authors were trying for her being tempted by the Dark side as a result of her grief.  Instead, Lena just dissolved into moody whining and Ethan followed right down with her.  A rift develops between them, but it felt forced, and made the book depressing and plodding for the entire first half.<br /><br />However, the book also had a lot of exciting and unexpected story twists that made it a must-read.  (But as in book one, nearly all take place in the second half.)  Many questions from book one are answered, such as about Ethan's mother and what exactly happened in the conclusion of book one.  Plus, Ethan and Link go through some unforseen changes.  New characters are also introduced to provide a different perspective on the story.  The authors also continue their world-building - expanding on the Caster mythology, the tunnels, Marian's role and the Ravenwood family.<br /><br />Overall, the first half was weak, and I almost put the book aside, but the answered questions and surprising developments redeemed the book.  I didn't enjoy this as much as [[ASIN:0316077038 Beautiful Creatures]], but it did leave me anticipating the next book.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|I was so excited to see this movie after seeing all the previews. It was a definite, must-get for my 10 year old step son for Christmas! So many laughs for kids and adults alike!
0765322889|5.0|There are most likely two types of readers who are interested in this book--the active reader and the passive reader. The passive reader is looking for a book that they can mindlessly read and have the the important points clearly spelled out for them. The passive reader should avoid this book.    The active reader will appreciate this book. If D+D books are like cheap pop music, Erikson's works are like a symphony. Yes, you will have to work to really appreciate the complexities inherent within. Yes, you should probably be very familiar with fantasy before you begin, but the way that Erikson weaves the plot and the characters is masterful. Genre cliches are entirely subverted here--it's all a refreshingly new way of writing fantasy. This book, like many of the first books, crescendos impressively to an intriguing ending, creating a compelling drama that seems intensely realistic when boiled down to its human elements. Erikson does such a good job of setting the story through detail that you truly feel transported to another destination.    In short, Erikson's writing style may turn off those who went every element in a fantasy book to happen for a specific reason, or those who prefer not to have the wealth of information to sort through. As someone who has read more fantasy than most, this is the best, taking all the qualities of George RR Martin (intricate plot, lush settings, deeply human characters) and expanding them.
B003EYVXXW|5.0|Good movie, but very sad.  Sad to see that early Christian could be so cruel to non believers. Otherwise, I really enjoyed the historical aspects and to know that women, while not equal,were allowed to teach men in the romen empire.

1589795474|5.0|This book was very informative on the way many of the wealthy people in this nation act and think. If people would put these principles into practice the financial mess we are in right now would go away. Live within your means and invest wisely are the two continuos thems in throughout this book. It goes into some detail about things most of us would never think about, such as: how much to spend on shoes, how much to spend on a house (well most think of this), how much to spend on a suit, etc... These policies can help correct what is wrong with America, blaming the rich for our financial woes. If everyone could put these principles in practice everyone could be worth more money than they are right now.   That being said it is very dry and repetitious. But if you stick to it and read the whole thing all the way through once or twice and put the ideas into practice it will help you tremendously.
0312600844|1.0|I searched the reviews and found mostly positive ones.  I thought how could all these people be wrong?   I should have remembered The Emperor's New Clothes. It was so unreal and depressing that I stopped reading this book. Why would anyone want to read a book like this? Why would anyone give it a good review? It is not a piece of literature but rather like a piece of cheap pulp fiction.
B003UESJH4|5.0|You know a film has worked when it defies your best intentions. Not being especially fond of historical dramas, British High Society or (perhaps because he has tended to exemplify both) Colin Firth, but buoyed by exemplary reviews (usually hard-as-nails FT critic Nigel Andrews reported being left in tears) I went along to The King's Speech determined to be analytical about it: weighing up frame composition, lighting, and so on - and intending to frame my review in terms the picture's success at the technical art of film making. I quite like that sort of thing. I got as far as noticing how nicely the frames were composed - the opening scene is an extreme wide shot of the  1925 Empire Exhibition at the Crystal Palace, itself disappearing into the fog, and punctuated dead centre by an antique microphone, suspended on the cross-hairs of its shock-mount. The frame is reversed and the crosshairs are revealed to be trained like a sniper target on poor old stammering Duke of York, at that stage still Albert prior to his character's coronation as George VI in 1936.<br /><br />At that point in the film, three minutes in, wherein the Duke's glottal stops, gag reflexes and not much else ricochet emptily around the blanketed arena like stray crossfire, the assembled multitude looks guiltily at its shoes, my critical aspirations were neutered as the exquisite melodrama swept me away. The best I managed for the remainder of the film was to note the repeated use of extreme wide-angle lens (any wider and it would have been fish eye) to accentuate the magnitude of the buildings and, I suppose the institutions this poor chap was expected to inhabit.<br /><br />Now I said I wasn't especially fond of Colin Firth as an actor, but I am now. Mr Firth utterly brings you in to the enormity of the world his character inhabits: it is a superb piece of acting. I dare say we've all reflected from time to time how awful it would be, in practice, to be royalty, but Firth's delicate yet assured performance makes it all so plain. You feel all of his pain: Unlike anyone else on the planet if pomp and ceremony, or for that matter complete isolation from casual friendship, is not your thing, you've simply no choice. To abdicate (the option favoured by Albert's older brother Edward) is to consign yourself forever into the wilderness of caricatured villainy. It had never happened before in the history of the British monarchy. But - so The King's Speech would have it - Edward was not cut out to be king. He was not of the right stuff. George VI, against his own better judgment, was.<br /><br />So at its heart, in the King's Speech you have an achingly sorry story about a shy man compelled to speak boldly to a whole nation at its darkest time. That would be enough for a good film, but the surrounding performances, and the excellent screenplay, catapult it further.<br /><br />Having tried all manner of cures, the disconsolate Duke's persevering wife is given one last recommendation: a particular Harley Street elocutionist by the name of Logue. Against all convention she pays him a visit. We immediately know something is not right as the elevator lurches downward, not upward, to a sparsely furnished basement with wrecked wallpaper and no receptionist. She is greeted directly by the elocutionist, a shirt-sleeved Australian, and he makes a facile excuse for not having a secretary. Nor does he make concessions for his guest's status. Australians don't have truck with that sort of thing.<br /><br />Geoffrey Rush, playing the Australian, is excellent - suitable not just on account of his native laconic Strine-ness (if anything the Ocker is dialed back from normal) but also in his flawless comic timing. While there is a rustic solemnity to much of his performance, it is the lighter moments that set it off. The central helix here is the relationship between these two men: both outsiders, both unqualified for their tasks, both of whom would rather be doing something else (in Logue's case, amateur dramatics), but both uniquely positioned by their character to carry out their designated roles.<br /><br />I'm pleased to report Helena Bonham Carter managed to slip her Burtonesque Gothic minders for this outing, and while there is just that hint of darkness about her performance - there always is - what you notice is how plausible a young Queen Mother (as most will remember her) she portrays. Timothy Spall's Churchill is, as you expect, played largely (but reverently) for laughs and Derek Jacobi is the closest we get to a villain (the real villain here is circumstance) as a rather judgmental Archbishop of Canterbury.<br /><br />The talent is, needless to say, from the top shelf of British acting corps, and the pacing and staging of the drama is masterfully done. Flickfeast's Chris Knipp made the excellent observation that this is essentially a sports movie - the genre is overcoming insurmountable odds in the nick of time armed only with a motivational speech - in other clothes. And so it is, but it is so expertly done that you'd be hard hearted indeed not to fall for its charms.<br /><br />I have a sneaking suspicion that I've been manipulated by a good formula weepie, but it was done so cleverly and tactfully that I really don't mind. Essential viewing.<br />Olly Buxtont both uniquely positioned by their character to carry out their designated roles.

B0019N8P2W|5.0|Well maybe it's just a glimpse of the past or maybe me just remembering the days of school crushes and watching MTV after skipping classes, but I actually was excited when I found this long awaited series on dvd. It was about time! I give it a thumbs up.It was good to actually watch this show episode to episode instead of catching it randomly on tv. They have changed one thing, the music. As cool as it would be to hear the grunge sounds of yester year they have replaced it with song melodies that sound kinda similar. But hey, who remembers what songs where actually playing back then anyways so not to big of deal. So all in all I do say go buy it. Besides more then likely someone you know will be excited they weren't the only one who watched it!
0802130208|5.0|Set against the tumultuous backdrop of the 1960s, A Confederacy of Dunces is a book unlike any other that I have previously read. I have often heard it referred to as THAT book, a kind of complement coming from those in the know. Having read it, all I can say about it is that THAT book is stupendous on many different levels, from its forceful yet literary bluntness to its all-around observational astuteness, from character development all the way down to the colorful scenes in which New Orleans is \\"lovingly\\" depicted. And above all else, the rude, ribaldry and stand-offish humor is just too good of a reading pleasure to pass up, a book that's all laced together into episodic lunacy and idiocy. A Confederacy of Dunces will make you want to read it and read it and read it all over again till it's just torn and tattered. No hyperbole here. Just honesty.     With impeccable writing prowess that is evocative of modern Southern writing, A Confederacy of Dunces just crackles with societal acumen, raunchiness and absurdity.  At the beginning, the main character-Ignatius J. Reilly-a thirtieth, idiosyncratic intellectual lay-about who's better at preaching his doctrine of the end of the world through its vices then he is about truly combatting the influences they hold over him, is in search of a job. It is a deplorable task set by his beleaguered mother, Irene, a not full-blown lush with a penchant for muscatel, whose frayed nerves cause her to crash slightly into a building, whereby she needs to make financial amends. Hence, he is cast out into the wide world, using his own warped ideological thinking and the philosophical beliefs-as espoused by Boethius-as one would clutch onto the Bible and Jesus Christ in order to combat the known modernism of a sometimes off-kilter pop culture. And never mind the Blessed Virgin Mary, whom many people seek in times of woe and confusion (for he and his mom are both semi practicing Catholics), Ignatius has his own female goddess, Fortuna, akind of feminine Holy Spirit, if you will, who he constantly accuses, till the end, at least, of his misfortune and mea culpa misery.         But once out in the open, to his mother's joy, he becomes a job seeker, and the jobs he falls into, well, it's quite something. He partly wants to pursue this endeavor in order to put Myrna Minkoff, an on and off again friend/girlfriend in her  place; she is a bleeding heart bohemian with a guitar who is always involved in one social cause or another. She cares about Ignatius, even sees brilliance in him. Yet, she sees that he is stunted and repressed, and she wants to unlock that. For her, it is all a matter of sex. Once he lets loose, he will be free, for that normal human inclination cannot simply be locked away and forgotten. And Ignatius, much to his credit, certainly does try.  She exists in the novel through flashbacks, a series of correspondences and then, in the very end, the two teammates are finally reunited.         While the correspondences between Ignatius and Myrna are entertaining, it's not until Ignatius lands a job with Levy Pants and then Paradise Vendors, a hot dog company, that things just start to blow up. And somehow, it all goes back to the Night of Joy, a dive of a strip bar whose proprietress, Lana Lee, is a money hungary, hard-bitten, cut-throat businesswoman. She's involved in a side pornography photo ring and hates Ignatius with every fiber of her being, for he and his mother entered her \\"establishment\\" in the early part of the novel, and she had him pegged as a bizarre freak who was not good for her business. Also in Lee's employ is Darlene and Burman Jones; the former is a ditzy but good-hearted dancer who wants to better herself by doing a classier strip tease involving her pet cockatoo: Harlot O'Hara, the virginal Southern beauty. Quite a show! The latter is the bar's janitor who gets paid below the minimum wage, a sum that he resentfully agrees to, for if he does not, he will get arrested forbeing a vagrant. Lana Lee surely does take advantage of the Jim Crow attitude, but Jones is ever mindful and ever patient. But his actions are seen throughout the novel and culminate with Lana Lee's eventual morals charge arrest alongside those of a couple of mannish and violent lesbians. And Angelo Mancuso's rise, from incompetent police officer who initially tried to arrest Ignatius at the beginning of the novel, to top-notch cop. There are so many interlocking stories that offer equal hilarity, for these are just snippets.         A Confederacy of Dunces is truly a cyclone of inventiveness, word play, colorfulness and sheer storytelling. All the characters who encounter Ignatius either get their just deserts or reap positive benefits from their meeting. The characters Gus Levy, Burma Jones, Angelo Mancuso and Miss Trixie are cases in point who benefit from their encounter with Ignatius. The story first and foremost is about the man Ignatius, a true brother to Don Quixote, a bloated, long-winded fat slob who thinks that the world is screwed up and he's the only normal one in it. It's actually a relatable kind of thinking. Stop the world. I want to get off. I know I've said that more often than not. It is about the interlocking idiots who make up our lives, the confederacy of individuals either for us or against us. But at heart, there is goodness. There is just a short supply of tolerance in dealing with them. And Ignatius is the exemplar in the testing of that tolerance. A great book.
B003RS1V1E|5.0|I cannot wait to see the first episode of Season 4!!! This show is amazing and the finale was quite literally the most interesting, suspensful, envelope-pushing, grade A 45 minutes of television I have ever seen in my life. It definitely did not let me down! Awesome. The BEST. Whoever wrote this finale and the episode before it is a freakin genius!

B00015YVDG|1.0|As a few others have said, Gary Sinise was the only one who shined in this movie and is believable for the part he plays; Mel Gibson's character is a corrupt SOB who you're supposed to feel for, but is really just a terrible person, who let an innocent man suffer in prison for his airline deal to go through...and we're supposed to care about what happens to him or his son?
0553381687|5.0|Just read game of thrones and it has refreshed my interest in Fantasy books.  Very exciting and hard to put down! For mature audiences only!
B003A3K3JW|4.0|Gustavo Dudamel and the Orquesta Sinfónica Simón Bolívar de Venezuela certainly produce music that is both exciting and loud, however more than that is needed to convey the unprecedented imaginary of Stravinky's Rite of Spring.  I was left with the impression that a great deal of energy was expended at the expense of finesse and colour.  There is a sense that everyone involved was having a great deal of fun, but Dudamel's direction lacks a degree of imagination that is found in a number of other recorded performances. The performance succeeds in the more visceral moments than it does in quiet ones.  And I did get the feeling that fast means loud and quiet means slow.  The artistry of of the orchestra is to be greatly admired, but of course, they cannot match the subtle colours produced by great orchestras. This is especially noted in the woodwinds.  I will listen to this Rite for its youthful exuberance, but the gem here is certainly Silvestre Revueltas's  La noche de los mayas.   For an insight into Stravinksy's fabulous fantasy, I rely on Bernstein - NYPO 1972, Haitink - LPO 1973, Abbado - LSO 1978 and best of all, Gergiev - Kirov Orchestra 2001. A performance of passion, precision, colour and detail that captures my imagination on each hearing!

1599218011|5.0|To categorize this as a diet book is misleading - it is not another fad or newfangled idea. No, Kris has written a thoroughly researched, honest, reliable and wickedly funny reference on what the human body needs to thrive; from nourishment to lifestyle to the hygiene of your colon. Every new little human should pop out with this book and hand it to his parents immediately.      I do not have cancer but after stumbling across Kris's Crazy Sexy Cancer DVD in the library, I went on to read her books and began incorporating some of her Crazy Sexy Cancer Tips into my life.  Crazy Sexy Diet pulls it all together.  Kris explains how the digestive system works, what humans are designed to consume and why the SAD isn't working.  You'll venture into your colon and get up close and personal with your crap, in a good way!  Even though I considered myself pretty up on the health-conscious scene before CSD: vegetarian, eating organic and local as much as possible, growing much of my own veggies and greens, runner/ triathlete and regularly hitting the yoga mat or massage table - I was floored to discover all my unhealthy and unnecessary habits....cheese, coffee, irregular sleeping hours, stressed-out days, not enough greens, etc.      Anyone who also grew up in the Bisquick, Jello, Velveeta, Tang and Spam era will appreciate Kris's witty tales of what we were fed (and what we craved) as kids.  When you get to the shopping list in Chapter 8 hoof on down to your best produce section and cozy up with the book in your car, the cafe or on the floor next to the leafy greens.  You'll want to see, touch and identify the tantalizing array of veggies and greens Kris introduces you to. Your new BFF.  Better yet, become a farmer's market or CSA junkie this season. Yes, it takes superhuman effort for me to leave that box of mac and cheese on the grocery shelf knowing it would put a food-like substance in front of my hungry kids in less than 15 mins, but Kris offers alternatives that are a snap to prepare plus they're real food.  The recipes in the book are totally doable, require items you can readily find and include kid-friendly ideas. And there are snacks - like dark chocolate!      Even though there's a lot in this book, it's not radically over the top so if you've NEVER had a green juice or smoothie or don't know kale from collards (as I didn't) you won't feel like there's something wrong with that. Kris tips you off on her fav kitchen supplies and appliances, as well as where to shop around, so swapping your SAD kitchen ware for a CSD life is  accessible and easy.  There's a super Resources section at the back of the book if you get jazzed about something in particular and want to know more.    I want everyone to read this book!
B00004TS0E|5.0|Every Christmas season my family and I sit down to watch this version of Miracle on 34th Street.  We usually watch it 4 to 5 times.  The actors are perfect fits for each part.  It really does go right along with the feeling of Christmas.  This is important family bonding time.  A wonderful movie.
0525951652|5.0|I really enjoyed the book.  I did not know much about the Great War and now I feel like I have a very deep grasp of not only the world at that time but it also changes how I look at the problems today.  I loved the interwoven stories and sexy scenes.  I am a very avid reader and I am super glad to have picked this book up.  I would highly suggest this to people who slept or \\"dreamed\\" through high school history class.  This will put you back on track! Thanks Ken Follett!
B000FCKC4C|4.0|This book helped me to see things in a different perspective. i have definetly re-read this book just for fun.
B002ZG981E|5.0|I don't say that about too many movies!  The first time you watch it, you get the basic plot of the movie.  Watching it again, you understand it a little more.  Honestly, I don't think I will ever understand this movie completely, but the tension leaves me on the edge of my seat every time I watch it.  It deserves all kinds of awards, as far as I'm concerned.
0399536108|1.0|This book at the very best is beginners book.  I have always had a hard time with people who brag about their charitable endeavors to the point of being condescending.  Also, this book has nothing that is new and is basically ripping off concepts that people like Dan Kennedy have been pushing for years.  The part on goals is very shallow.  I don't get the point on this book.  Hooray that he went overseas and got to work on the medical boat.  I applaud that.  What I don't like is his know it all delivery.  There really isn't much of substance in this effort.  Try the 4 hour work week or some of Dan Kennedy's books if you are interested in marketing.  This guy has done a poor effort of ripping them off.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|The premise of the show sounds really hincky, I know, but the show is truly awesome.  It is the best show on television (sorry, Mad Men).  It is so well written, has so many layers, the acting is outstanding, and it shows that there are consequences to your actions.  For me, it's equal to the quality of \\"The Wire.\\"
B0041ZQHHA|5.0|This album is truly like a story.  I find myself desperate to here the next song, lyric. I agree with most of the reviews- the more you listen to the ALBUM the more addicting it becomes.  I cannot stop listening to it ,it's like I am listening to it for the first time everytime.  Only the young is a beautiful song.  It's about hope and how life will come full circle.  When I first heard the clock was ticken I thought it was a cheesy song and did not care for it but then I accidently listened to the lyrcis and it turned out it to be the saddest/funniest song I have ever heard and it made me cry. Great song and story.  I hope everyone is lucky enough to feel what I feel when listening to this album. Hear and feel for yourself..
B001AQT11M|5.0|We have enjoyed this DVD from day one. I believe in the month that we have had it it has been viewed everyday by my toddler.
B001RTSPVY|4.0|We absolutely love Breaking Bad.  It's entertaining and you never know what's going to happen.  It is far from predictable.

B002BB702M|5.0|First: If you haven't seen this movie before, the Extended radically changes a key protagonist into a mail-tampering felon. THIS version is worth buying or renting and I strongly recommend it for at least the first two viewings of the movie before curiosity gets the better of you.    That being said, this is my favorite movie of all time. For lack of better superlatives, let me put it in these terms...if I had my list of Top Ten movies, and I could pick either this one, or the other nine, I would chose Cinema Paradiso. I'm not alone in my passion for this movie either, it is so rich that it draws people in for many various personal reasons.  It isn't a family movie or something to watch in an airplane. It is a movie you watch quietly, particularly if you are in a retrospective mood or having a challenge in your life.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|I have watched Band of Brothers, Saving Private Ryan, ext ext. All of the WWII movies but, they are all set in Europe. Now this on the other hand really shows what the marines went through, it was a totally different enemy, setting, weather, combat missions, objectives and everything else that has to do with war. I think it tops every single war movie or series I have ever seen especially of the quality and smoothness of the series.
B000WD66BM|3.0|Oceanborn's a little dark, but overall, I enjoy listening to Nightwish. \\"Moondance\\", \\"The Riddler\\", \\"The Pharoah Sails to Orion\\", and \\"Stargazers\\" would have to be my favorite songs from this album.
0307266303|4.0|Ach, if the writer could give up that relentless hyperbole, this could be a good book. But first things first. I enjoy running and I admire runners who are more enduring than me. I especially like running as a test of endurance. Therefore a book about running is sure to attract me.   McDougall starts by describing the Tarahumara, a tribe of native Mexicans living in Copper Canyon. They achieve astonishing feats of endurance while foregoing all modern equipment. Then he switches to modern Ultramarathoners and their races, describing them as a special kind of modern tribe, fun - loving but pure. From this he comes to his theory of men being natural runners, hunting in prehistoric times by outrunning their prey, similar to todays wold packs. The book culminates in a final running competition between the Tarahumaras and modern Ultramarathoners.  Why does the author need to spice up an essentially good read so relentlessly. Is every canyon death-defying? Are there women in Ultramarathon who are not breathtaking beauties? And are these ultramarathoners really all so cool? Actually his description of the ultramarathoners reminded me very much of my experiences with freeclimbers, who affect a similar style of coolness. Hyping themselves and their tribes so relentlessly that they do not realize when, after a brief intoxication with all these cool dudes and their tales of death defying deeds, boredome sets in. The second canyon rarely can out 'death-defy' the first one....  Furthermore the author does not in the slightest indulge in the most obvious criticisms of his 'barefoot running is good for you' theory. I must admit that I bought Vibram five fingers and they feel great. But I am a mediocre marathoner. Why do all world-class marathoners wear shoes? And how does the author know how running really affects the health of the Tarahumaras? From his book I gather that reliable statistics on this reclusive tribe are rare indeed.  Thus one should take this book as an inspirational introduction to Ultramarathon. The rest is conjecture.
0307593525|4.0|The books were a wonderful Christmas gift and I have already caught her testing a couple of the recipes and reading through it. Better than getting her a gift I saw when I bought it, saw it when I wrapped it, and will never see it again because she didn't like it.

B004498KPU|5.0|Great collection of all of Michael Jackson's music videos. They're all here... Thriller, Beat It, Billie Jean, Remember the Time, Black or White, Rock With You, and much more!
0061906220|5.0|The greatest part about this book, is that it comes with a website that you can go to and have your kids listen to a recording of someone reading the book because parts of the book are sung and to hear the melody is great. My niece and nephew love this book so much that they now have the book memorized and love to say it along with the guy who reads it on the recording. We love sitting all together and listening - like book on tape! Adorable story too.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Hadn't even seen the previews for this, but so glad we went to see it! Great acting job done by all, great action (my personal favorite is when he steps out of the spinning police car!!) and VERY funny!
0061537969|4.0|My sister recommended this to me, mostly because we were thinking of naming our baby Enzo if it turned out to be a boy.  She said the book was amazing and very cute, so I took it with me on a long flight back East.  About 4 pages into it, I started crying... mind you, I'm on a plane surrounded by people and pregnant... so you can imagine what my neighbors thought!  The book is awesome, tear jerking, emotional and clever humor, all told from a dog's perspective.<br /><br />If you dug Marley and Me, and love dogs... this is a great book for you.  Even if you're not a Marley and Me fan, this book is a good read when you're not looking for something too intellectual.
015204907X|5.0|My 3-year-old son has really been enjoying this book. We got it from the library but will need to add it to our collection soon. It has been part of his bedtime stories for two weeks now. We highly recommend it!  Although the words are simple and few, it is a great pre-reading book as children quickly learn the predictable, yet whimsical story.  My son loves to be able to complete the sentences (Here is the BLUE SHEEP) and can almost retell the whole book by himself now.  It is also a great lesson in opposites and looking at the pictures for clues about the story.

I love \\"If I walk away\\" and \\"Love only knows\\" There might be a couple songs where I\\"m like meh this song is alright but all in all Josh did a fantastic job. All the whiners out there just need to stop complaining and appreciate this awesome music. You jam Josh Groban, you made one of your long time fans happy again. Keep the awesome tunes coming.
B0036G94DY|2.0|Very quiet little fan - quiet because it spins much slower than most of these little fans.  Unfortunately, the slower speed and small size results in very little air movement.  Hard to tell it is even pushing any air. Was going to use for a southbridge cooler but decided to get a fan that pushed more CFM.  2 wire so no tach for speed monitoring. Sorry I bought it.
0756405890|5.0|God there is so much in the book but leaves so much to be told. Circus troop life, poverty,thievery,  university life, and all souronding by a love for music and the knowledge for magic. By the end of the book it's like I find myself with the first act and the first couple lines to the final act and everything else is left for the next book.

B003J27WFW|5.0|Wow! For any of those who might have grown up with this band, this DVD is an absolute must. I was born in 1959 and my early favorites were groups like Yes, ELP and Pink Floyd. The same as another young group (need I mention). A lot of great, great memories came back to me being the \\"Rush Fanatic Fan\\" but the young fans are not forgotten and they will cherish this as well. Produced and Directed with absolute perfection. \\"G\\" rated,..in my opinion,..despite a few \\"F\\" words which go unheard. Drowned out by the intense interest of the viewer. A great DVD for all and everyone.
B000JQUZCI|4.0|Alright, I'll admit it - up until roughly a year ago I was a complete literary ignoramus. Then I started reading books and since then I've found a new addiction, classic literature. I was one of those people that thought Frankenstein was the monster and I figured the original story would be as laughable as the old clips of those classic Frankenstein movie with the mad scientist (\\"IT'S ALIIIIIIVE!\\"). As it turns out, his is a very harrowing tale and it's completely different than I imagined it to be. Thankfully.<br /><br />This is one of those occasions where I really don't want to sum up the plot because you might be like me and I'd hate to spoil anything for you. The plot twists come early and the line between who is the 'good guy' and who is the 'bad guy' are quickly blurred. Until about half way through (maybe a little further) I truly didn't know which way this tale was heading!<br /><br />Here's a tiny bit, just the beginning--<br />Captain Robert Walton is set out to explore the North Pole. His ship is eventually incased in ice when he discovers a man from Geneva named Victor Frankenstein. Victor spills his tale. Victor is a scientist who created and then immediately abandoned a living abomination.<br /><br />That's it. i don't want to give anything significant away.<br /><br />I love this book but I just couldn't give it five stars. The main reason is because it bogs down a bit in areas. The worst example of this is when the monster is telling Victor his tale about a family he was spying on so he could learn more about human nature, how to speak, how to emote, etc. This is all interesting, but then he digs into this family's history and goes into a MASSIVE digression spanning pages upon pages about whom is marrying whom, all their relationships, etc - minutia to the extreme and it's all for naught. This section could have been cut down drastically without risk because when it all boils down, none of these details on this family matter and none of it is all that interesting.<br /><br />Aside from the complaint above I found this novel to be quite good. Much better than I thought it was going to be! Definitely check this one out. Aside from the dreadfully boring section I mentioned above this would have been an easy five, which I rarely give.mplaint above I found this novel to be quite good.

B003R0LBVW|2.0|I liked the first chapter as much as any American fiction I have read lately. The rest of the book was a sagging, overlong disappointment that attempts to fill in all of the context that is absent in that first 30 pages. Franzen seems to have been going for arresting and insightful, a chronicle of the underbelly of American affluence. The broad devices he uses in the opening work to capture and satirize the milieu; but, of course, everyone's story is not Walter's and so the more he fleshes out details, the less resonance I found.
B001HUZYKI|4.0|book took so long in getting here that i ended up ordering another from different seller and I still got that one earlier, this book took over a month to get here and all other books i have ever ordered from Amazon arrived within one week. book was in excellent shape but if your in a hurry look else where. no hurry? fine.
1936594293|5.0|I have read this book three times and just do not seem to tire of it. It's not only a great classic, but it's readable and often amusing with well-rounded characters and a delightful plot.
030726999X|1.0|I was so bored and frustrated by \\"Played With Fire\\"; too many characters, unremarkable plot, and more redundant dialog than a Star Wars movie. Many times I skipped paragraphs, pages, entire plot points crying \\"We KNOW.  Get ON with it!\\"  Judging by the 1-3 star reviews here, \\"Hornet's Nest\\" is the same if not worse.  I just can't bring myself to read it but I was curious enough to want to know what happened.  So, if you feel the same way, don't slog through the book.  Search for \\"Kicked the Hornet's Nest\\" on Wikipedia and read the summary.  If you can - I got bored even reading just that.
0061743526|5.0|Purchased for my 12 yr old grandson.  A wonderful read weaving a rich and realistic backward look at the hypocrisy and prejudice of \\"deep South\\" thinking and culture in the 30's.  \\"Mockingbird\\" provides an opportunity for rich conversation, discussion and learning between generations.
B002SJKWZ4|5.0|I bought this as a gag gift for my wife for Christmas as she and my daughter are huge Harry Potter fans.  Wouldn't you know it, it was her favorite gift.  It came exactly as advertised. There is a bit of work (just a bit) to get the remote up and running but once it's \\"trained\\" you are able to proceed with surfing 'til your heart's content. The wand works very well as a remote and I'm the \\"greatest husband in the world\\" for having been so thoughtful. Win - Win.

1562827693|3.0|The Book by Jon Kabat-Zinn is phenomenal, I'd recommend to everyone!  My complaint is with the bookseller who shipped me a soft cover book.  I specifically searched for a hard back copy and paid the extra amount.  I was extremely dissapointed with this, and hope it isn't indicative of this bookseller.
B003ZTQN1I|1.0|I am not one to call country my music of choice, but I fell in LOVE with the actors and the music on Country Strong.  Had to run out and buy the cd.  Even went to two stores to find it.  Couldn't wait to open and play it.  Boy, was I disappointed when most of the songs are not performed by the actors/singers in the movie.  They should not say it is \\"COUNTRY STRONG:  ORIGINAL MOTION PICTURE\\"  when it really is not!  They are probably performed by the song's original artists - but that is not why I ran all over town and spent good money to buy this cd.  Guess I'll have to go to iTunes as another person recommended.  Next time, I'll investigate before buying.
B002ZG981E|5.0|Such a great deal for a great movie. I bought it as a gift for my brother for christmas and now I get to keep one of the copies! Haven't tried out the digital copy yet, but 3 for the price of 1 is great.

If you like yourself and care about being healthy and happy - zoom to the store and get a copy.  This book will change your life forever. It's an easy read, filled with incredible information,humor and inspiration.  It's about being healthy from inside and out!  PRICELESS!

I was going to use it as a Christmas present but it didn't get here   in time for that so I had to use it as a Birthday present instead.

0316067598|1.0|I am a Marine, and with that said I am also a particle physicists. I have seen my share of the good and ugliness, the smart and the stupid.     In my opinion as a Marine, this book self-bolsters about a certain type personality that is not only ingrained in SEALS but in most patriots of the U.S. Military.  As I feel for the situation and tragedy the author wrote about, I disagree with the tone in which he told it. It is not very honorable to blame anyone for death, not liberals, not the media, not politicians. Death is the inevitable of all beings and should be honored accordingly as such. This book was horrible propagation of the authors agenda and how the freedom of the U.S. is an illusion.      In my opinion as an educated person, who holds two B.S. (Bachelor of Science), M.S. (Masters of Science), and a PhD, I have to say the errors and structure on which this book is organized is horrible. By the time I read to page 60, I had 1/4 of the pages filled with fragmented sentences, misuse of conjunction words, wrong grammar, and misuse of definitions. Basically my copy of the book looks like my first 9th grade attempt at an essay....red pen everywhere.    Please if you read this, save your money. Read a book on the war the has some meaningful attempt at telling our story. I recommend \\"To Kill Bin Laden\\".

0312600844|1.0|I pushed myself to read this extremely long book that utterly failed to deliver. He devotes an excess of time to the development of the main characters and then leaves many unanswered questions about their dynamics and behaviors.  All the characters have exagerated behaviors, which I liked, but there is little effort to really help the reader understand what fuels their behavior. This is particularly true in the case of the wife and son.
B003NFM3JU|5.0|This video should be used by all film students as a lesson in compositon.  Every frame, whether at the beginning of a scene or at the end, shows perfect compositon.  Every camera move is necessary and results in revealing something that was not known at the beginning of the scene.  Not since \\"The Third Man\\" has there been such an excellent teaching tool.  But, beyond the technical aspects, it is just a great movie that all ages can appreciate without analysis.
030746363X|4.0|The Four Hour Body is a book that contains tools for you to try and then incorporate into your life or discard. Easy. It doesn't present itself as anything else. Tim Ferriss has done the research and personal experimentation for you, all you have to do is give it a try. I LOVE the ab workouts and Slow Carb diet he has in here and after just 10 days of doing both am already seeing results. Am also starting on the kettlebell swings and can see they're going to help me reach my goals. Take what works for you and chuck the rest. It's not a comprehensive book about \\"Everything Body\\", but it's a compilation of a variety of sources with Tim's choice of the best from each source included in this book.
B000EBD9TY|5.0|I wanted to see what the hype about Marlon Brandon was all about in this movie. Boy, was I rewarded. He is phenomenal here and greatly overshadows everything else. Vivian Leigh, who plays the crazy Blanche Dubois, was a much bigger star at the time this was made in 1951, but her performance pales next to Brando who is modern, vital, unpredictable and could just as well have been something out of 2011 as almost 60 years ago. Stella is next best, doing very well showing her lust. The young Karl Malden is also good. The extras get a bit tedious, but I was fascinated by the one about censorship and the hurdles this innocent play had to overcome with the Hollywood code and the Catholic \\"Legion of Decency.\\" You will laugh at what was deemed immoral back then, and marvel at the side by side views of what was cut compared with the restored version. We have come far.
B003L20ICE|5.0|Right after watching this movie, I hated it.  The theme seemed to be that a family should be submissive to the will of the domineering, hypercritical partner/parent.  However, after a couple days thought, I realized that I had misunderstood the ending.<br /><br />I made the stupid error of assuming that a lesbian writer/director would automatically love all lesbians and hate all men.<br /><br />The superficially \\"happy ending\\" that so angered me at first was actually intended to be a tragic ending.  That made this a truly great movie.
1599218011|5.0|Kris' latest book, Crazy Sexy Diet, is a must read for anyone who is searching for the truth about health and healing.  Her witty and downright funny approach makes the transition much more palatable.  I began following her after a cancer diagnosis 5 years ago and honestly don't know how I would have come through it without her motivation, humor, knowledge and strength.  I have turned to Kris' books countless times to pull me from the darkness into the light.  This last book is packed with all of her latest research and is basically a manual for surviving in today's world.  If you want to heal an illness or prevent one, this is the book for you....in other words, it's for everyone!!  Enjoy it and prepare to be the healthiest you've ever been!!
B003XQM2YU|3.0|Nothing compared to the Kevin C version.  This is not a movie of a lot of action, it fact, until the final sceen, it had very little.  It was an ok \\"story\\" and a long, drama.  A lot of characters, a lot to try and follow.  I expect more from Crowe, a more intense role but still overall, not the worst movie, just long drama that hopefully ends here.

1936594234|1.0|Knowing I'm a psychology student with a big interest in the world of the subconscious, a friend of mine purchased this book for me as a gift, due to the huge number of positive reviews. It's a shame that when a bad review is given, fans of the book automatically give the negative review an \\"unhelpful\\" rating, in order to bury it where buyers will never see the dissent unless they want to wade through 250+ reviews to find it. Whether or not something is helpful is not automatically equal to whether or not you agree with it.     Fact 1: This book is not psychology, not even pop-psychology. It does not discuss the intricacies of the subconscious mind or how to access it on any real or deep level. It is at best, the same New Age \\"philosophy\\" that has since been rewritten in various forms, the newest and most popular being \\"The Secret\\". The philosophy: whatever you think comes true. If you find this belief as tired and unfounded as I do, skip this book. Murphy takes it farther than most, however, even going so far as to say that using willpower and putting real-world effort into success will DEFEAT your subconscious mind and result in your continued suffering. If you work hard for something, after all, it must mean that you wanted to struggle!    Fact 2: Even if that's what you're looking for, skip this book anyway. Why? Murphy's text just repeats the same thing over and over, with no real technique presented outside of telling you to repeat \\"prayers\\" to yourself over and over again throughout the day. There are many other New Age books out there that will undoubtedly give you a MUCH better overview and \\"how-to\\" if you actually believe in this stuff.    Fact 3: If you're not looking for a scientific book, that's fine, but the problem is that Murphy claims this book IS scientific. The bulk consists of anecdotal stories with no references or background, while conveniently ignoring the countless available examples of people dying due to a reliance on blind faith. There area few mentions of \\"prominent psychologists\\" from the 1800's who were really not psychologists at all, but rather faith healers and so on. Murphy actually seems completely oblivious to science, talking about such unfounded things as how thoughts travel through nerves to your solar plexus, where he claims your subconscious lives... What?    Fact 4: While he says his book is about science, he continually quotes the Bible and references Jesus. He calls successful healings in other cultures \\"grotesque procedures.\\" If I were Christian, I'd still be offended, because he reinterprets the Bible to support his theory at every turn. Meanwhile, his philosophy is a religion itself - blind faith in the \\"divine intelligence\\" of the subconscious mind. Murphy basically presents your subconscious as god, sometimes even calling it so. He even claims your subconscious existed and created you and your body before you were born!    Fact 5: He contradicts himself at every turn. While your subconscious mind is supposed to contain \\"infinite intelligence,\\" your subconscious is also dangerously stupid. Though he says it only works in \\"lifeward\\" (positive, healthy) ways, he also says it will blindly follow any fear or worry that crosses your mind in order to bring you sickness, poverty and destruction. Since most people aren't capable of pure positive thought at all times, Murphy can always find a reason why this \\"universal truth\\" might not work for you. Even if his theory was technically true, it would be functionally useless for most people.
B000KIE11Q|5.0|Well, I'm 18 and before this watch all I had used were digital watches (Casio, mostly). I didn't need the alarm as I use my cell phone for this purpose, so I decided it was time to change to a classic watch.

The feel and the weight are perfect for me and the size is great. So far I'm really happy with it.<br /><br />Plus, if you let it catch some sunlight... the hands will glow in the dark!

0553381687|3.0|Let me preface by stating that the first book in the popular series by George R. R. Martin is well written with nicely drawn characters.  That being said, in my opinion, this work comes no where near other fantasy series (LOTR, Potter, Narnia, Golden Compass, etc.).<br /><br />When a paperback book is over 800+ pages you recognize the commitment as a reader that you are undertaking.  While this was not wasted time, it was definitely too large a commitment to a novel that plays out like a medieval soap opera rather than an exciting fantasy novel.  The battle between warring factions and throne seats has it all - drama, incest, war, brutality and poltical posturing.  It didn't feel like 800 pages (most of the time) as the pages moved quickly by.<br /><br />However, I am going to wait for the success/failure of the upcoming HBO miniseries before I decide to venture further into this 4-part saga.

1433243881|5.0|What an amazing memoir, but not quite a memoir! What I Talk About When I Talk About Running is the memoir of Japanese author Haruki Murakami. But even Murakami admits that it's not a \\"traditional\\" memoir, and in fact his original concept was to publish it as a book of essays. The story has its roots in Murakami's training for the New York City Marathon, but what makes this story so interesting is his veering off the track to share thoughts about his life, career, his childhood, music, and love. He reflects on living in Boston and Hawaii. He shares his views of the world around him, and in doing he innocently gives the reader food for fodder for our own lives. And all cleverly linked together by his training.<br /><br />\\"Once you set the pace, the rest will follow. The problem is getting the flywheel to spin at a set speed - and to get to that point takes as much concentration and effort as you can imagine.\\"<br /><br />What's particularly interesting to me is the insights he gives on writing and the origins of his writing. Not knowing much about Murakami except for his being a brilliantly popular writer, What I Talk About When I Talk About Running really let me get to know the man behind the writing. The bar owner turned writer, who loves to run even though his aging body is slowing down. And even a book \\"about running\\" in the hands of Haruki Murakami is beautifully written. It's inspiring, it's humbling.<br />\\"Sometimes when I think of life, I feel like a piece of driftwood washed up on shore.\\"<br />I listened to the audiobook of What I Talk About When I Talk About Running as part of the Haruki Murakami Reading Challenge, which includes listening to audiobooks. But I enjoyed the story so much I intend to buy a copy of the book! The audiobook itself is a little over 4 hours, and is narrated by Shakespearean actor Ray Porter, who has an extensive audiobook background. Although the voice of the narrator is pleasing, at first I was a little taken aback, because I really expected a different type of voice to represent Murakami, but I slowly got use to Mr. Porter, who did a great job with all the subtleties of sharing the story with us.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend What I Talk About When I Talk About Running by Haruki Murakami to any runner or athlete, because it's a wonderful love story to the hard work of training for any event, but it's also a love story of living. There are so many other reasons to praise this book- it's inspiring, it's beautifully written, it's a great way to get to know the man behind the wildly popular books you can find in any bookstore. I loved it for all those reasons. And, if I could I would put on a pair of running shoes right now and go out running!

0312600844|1.0|This is gonna be short seeing as I haven't really read the whole thing. I received this as a Christmas present and I guess I was pretty excited about it at first (Oprah loved it!!!!!!), but then I actually started reading it. 60 pages in and I still could not care less about any of the characters. I'm pretty sure it's supposed to be a surprise when it's revealed that **** happened to the main character but really? Let's just say I haven't personally seen a Lifetime movie but even so I knew it was coming. Everything just seems so bland and predictable. I don't plan on finishing this book anytime soon if at all. Life's too short to read books you don't enjoy. Expect there to be a sub-par movie version of this book within the decade starring Jennifer Garner.

I liked how it was in a home setting, not a cheezy 80's arobic room, so I didn't feel silly doing the workout. She's a good coach, fun to work out to. Totally recomend this DVD

B003UESJH4|5.0|\\"The King's Speech\\" is a riveting picture.  Colin Firth plays a convincing Prince Albert of England years before he would become King of England, but before he can prove to himself worthy of the throne, which viewers will see or already know that his predecessor and brother David would temporarily bring controversy to the family, he must overcome the stammer that has plagued his life since he was four years-old.  And in order to help him to attempt to succeed is his speech therapist Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush)<br /><br />Director Tom Hooper has produced an enormously moving film that is shown with each scene and the impeccable craftsmanship to take viewers back into a time, period, and place where the importance of presentation appeared to be a all or nothing or all element, especially for those within the hierarchy of society.  But set that element aside and concentrate on the relationship that develops between Albert, also referred to as \\"Bertie\\" which he snickers at during their first meeting at Lionel's office to establish a less formal rapport.  Gradually Bertie comes to respect Lionel's method of attempting to overcome his speech impediment from listening to music while reading a passage from Shakespeare, singing to \\"Camptown Races,\\" and even indulging in bit of vulgarity to make his speech flow.  It is those methods that show progress throughout the film, but it is the moving moment where Bertie has to make those important speeches in front of a crowd that are the most dramatic parts of the film.  Hooper is very effective in showing viewers what Bertie may have encountered while standing in front of an audience or even making that monumental speech to the people of England during the opening chapter of England's engagement during World War II.  The scenes are highly emotional and show a man who looked through a lens that almost appeared claustrophobic, daunting, and exhausting.  However, by the end of the film, much applause and accolades go to Hooper's direction and Firth and Rush's presentation of showing the adversity that King George VI would overcome and achieve to be the leader that he had never realized he would become; the rest is history.<br /><br />After watching \\"The King's Speech,\\" there is no doubt that history indeed never stops being told in its rich and fascinating ways, especially through film.  This is a highly recommended and exceptional made film with an extremely heroic element that focuses on the human spirit.d Firth and Rush's presentation of showing the adversity that King George VI would overcome and achieve to be the leader that he had never realized he would become; the rest is history.

0307474712|5.0|I cannot vouch for the other sex and also, perhaps, for the most culturally snobbish among my girlfriends. That aside, I would confidently buy this book for every other female friend I've got.
B003UESJH4|2.0|I really don't understand the appeal of THE KING'S SPEECH, and I saw it twice just to make sure I came to the correct conclusion.  To me, it was just another BBC or Masterpiece Theater production.  It was OK but nothing special.  What was so great about watching a man trying to overcome his speech impediment because that's basically what this film was all about.  Some critics may have thrown in social class differences, development of a friendship--yadda, yadda, yadda.  BUT IT WAS STILL A FILM ABOUT A MAN TRYING TO OVERCOME HIS SPEECH IMPEDIMENT.  THE KING'S SPEECH would've been a much better film if it developed the characters more--especially King George V.  After seeing the film, I still don't really know who he was.  Most people stutter due to a lack of self-confidence.  That's probably why Bertie didn't stammer when he got upset and started yelling at Lioenl--he was filled with self-confidence in those instances.  So why was he lacking self-confidence?  This was never addressed in the film.  Did something happen to him as a kid?  Didn't he get enough love and attention from his parents?  Is he just an overly sensitive kid?  I would've liked to have known more instead of watching and listening to the repetitive therapist/patient sessions.  I really think THE KING'S SPEECH is overrated.  To me, THE SOCIAL NETWORK is a much better film.  It was based on a real person too but at least it had depth and developed its characters better.

1594202842|3.0|It is easy to get swept up in the hype that this book has generated from the now-viral Wall Street Journal article that highlights some of Chua's more sensational \\"Tiger Mother\\" moments. That my wife and I both gobbled the entire story up on our Nooks a couple of hours after purchasing it is testament to its ability to entertain. Naturally, its legitimacy as a memoir, as a case study on a model minority family, and as a parenting guide are loftier assertions to make.    In terms of the book being a memoir, Chua is hyperbolic and perturbing as a narrator. Occasionally, however, she is also self-deprecating, even relatable. Early on in the book, readers can sympathize with Chua as she goes head-to-head with her youngest in a battle of wits, to come out, for the first of many times, the loser. Chua's desperation at not being able to scare little Lulu into submission the way she always has been able to with her eldest daughter is endearing in its honesty. Few parents, whether following the \\"Chinese\\" style of child-rearing or its \\"Western\\"/\\"White\\" counterpart can claim not to have had such a moment.     This Chinese vs. Western motif is another hindrance to Chua being taken completely seriously. At the beginning of the book, Chua admits that \\"Chinese\\" is not a failsafe way to describe strict/traditional parenting, though she continues to use the term throughout the story. Later, as she describes her own successes and defeats, pre-children, she showcases the obvious failings of an educational background filled with rote memorization and strict obedience as she is unable to react creatively or off-the-cuff, hindering her professional opportunities. Chua talks little about her husband, only asserting that he is White and had a rather polar-opposite upbringing; yet they both managed to be successful ivy league graduates. In defense of her parenting methods, Chua often cites her own upbringing, but never with much depth, nor do any of her transcribed conversations with eitherof her parents - who feel that Chua is too rough with her girls - prove it. In this, the reader is left with a lot of Asian-American stereotypes that Chua only half-heartedly debates, and a narrator whom, even with circumstantial evidence stacked against her methods, stubbornly persists in bullying her children because \\"it's the Chinese way.\\"     As other reviewers have offered, as a parenting guide, Chua's book is wince-worthy, both the sensational moments like the now infamous \\"Little White Donkey\\" fiasco, and more subtle implications: How much time Chua spends touting her daughters back and forth from expensive music lessons and recitals and contests; how often she finds ways to muck up a few days of vacation and downtime at school with more mommy rigmarole; essentially, how much time she spends living their lives for them. In one sense, Chua seems to agree, or at least struggles towards admitting that hovering over her children 24/7 at the expense of her own happiness and theirs is problematic. However, she clings stubbornly to a dual-pronged thesis that a) she is right because the ends justify the means, and b) she is right because she can't afford to be wrong, making the book end on an ambiguous note. Readers will continue to wonder whether her eldest daughter will become an ivy league superstar, and how long Chua can remain on the sidelines of her youngest's burgeoning tennis playing before the need to oppressively micromanage her takes hold anew. In short, the story is hardly over, and it is doubtful that Chua has really learned much of a lesson.     In terms of the ends justifying the means, too, Chua gives herself a lot of credit for what seems to be a glut of glossed over class privilege and the work of a handful of other teachers and adult influences on her girls. In the same vein, I was unimpressed with Chua's categorizing of \\"MJ,\\" the ambiguously-gendered piano teacher as an \\"it,\\" while simultaneously raging at her daughters for giggling at foreign names and accents. In short, after reading about Chua demanding that her daughters remake their birthday cards for her so that they're good enough to go in a keepsake box (which can undoubtedly be pulled out for admirers as smug proof of her child-rearing success), and furiously riding her meekly obedient eldest to put more heart and nuance into a toast for her father's birthday, I was hoping for a bit more nuance out of Chua. Perhaps when she demands that her daughters write a sequel proving her harsh methods weren't a total bust in 5-10 years, they can assure readers that the Tiger Mother is more than a caricature.
B001UV4XHY|3.0|Perhaps this stems from the fact that \\"Deathly Hallows\\" was kind of a bummer climax to a great book series, one that failed to meet my expectations as a fan, and failed to rank as 5-star reading, coming from an author that had astounded me in the past with her exceptionalism in the quality of her literary output. The novel was slow-moving, often dragging itself to a complete halt before starting itself up again on a lame footing, and then tumbling to an unexciting and open-ended finale.        Not that I dislike the movie so much. It is merely that the film suffers solely from the problems of the book: an over-stretched and ridiculous plot (or lack thereof); a slow moving narrative, which took up over 700 pages when it easily could have used up only 300; and a ruthless extermination of nearly half the population of the Wizarding World in a single brutal sweep by Rowling herself. That being said, if you can disregard the seriously lacking storyline and nonexistent plot, \\"Hallows, Part 1\\" comes off as a fairly good film.    I have really come to appreciate why the production team chose to split it into two halves. While the tone of the next film is ostensibly going to be full of more fast-paced, action-packed thrills with lots of heroics and explosions, this first part is slower moving, with a kind of stationary adventure taking place outside of Hogwarts, a first for the books and the films. It is easily the darkest of all the films, with bleak, somber scenery, and as dark a tale to match. The characters are more fully explored, particularly the three young heroes, and their depth adds another, more mature element to the story.     Be prepared to shed a few tears, and to cover your eyes and your ears during some of the more horrific moments. I was especially creeped out by the scenes at Bathilda Bagshot's house, and the sequence of Bellatrix torturing Hermione at Malfoy Manor. The gristle and gore is quickly apparent, with frightening scenes of blood and death almostfrom the get-go (all courtesy of J.K. Rowling's book, I might add).  But considering the film was created by a team made up mostly of men and born from Rowling's imagination, I am thankful it wasn't any worse. While the same bad stuff happens, its been toned down to suit a PG-13 rating, and the gruesome shots never last more than a few seconds.    You do have to give yourself time to get used to being out of your element--like the book, you never get to see Hogwarts castle. Being a \\"road\\" picture, most of the story takes place during what seems like an extended camping trip. The main focus is the three kids and their quest to destroy Voldemort's Horcruxes, though what they do accomplish in the stretch of two and a half hours is precious little. While an improvement from the book, I was surprised afterward how much time it took for so little to happen, even though it seemed like things were in constant motion. The action is spread over numerous campsites across the country, with bits of action, character development, and plot exposition thrown in. Not the most inspiring setting, but it works better in a movie than I thought it would.     Regarding the script, Steven Kloves remained exceedingly faithful to J.K. Rowling's story, with the Deathly Hallows still taking front seat,  and everything else following, for better or worse. He is also equally as ruthless, sparing no one and leaving every death (all 6) in place that she put into what makes up the first installment. Even so, there are several changes which made for a great improvement to the plot. For instance, things move quicker leading up to the recovery of the first Horcrux. The pacing is shored up and sheared considerably from the book, where as I said before it dragged and dragged until it came to a complete halt. The film never stops moving, and often leaves you completely breathless. It is easily ten times more exciting than how it was written. To put it one way, I knew everything that was going to happen,yet I sat on the edge of my seat biting my nails the entire time. Little time is spent at either the Dursley's or the Burrow; Harry's birthday is completely skipped over; and Bill and Fleur's wedding is also condensed considerably. The time within Grimmauld place is robbed of screen-time but loaded with tension; the few moments inside are as nerve-wracking as any taking place in the forest outside.    The strained relationship between Harry, Ron, and Hermione felt monotonous and after a while unbelievable in the book, but because the acting of the three stars is so strong, it works in the movie. Amongst the discord, there is a sense of unity between the three friends. Harry doesn't argue so much with the other two and is less belligerent. The fights between he and Ron have been paired down to one, and he seems to be more understanding of Hermione's feelings in particular, making their special bond even more poignant. I really enjoyed several moments where he finally stands up and acts like a man, particularly the sequence where he comforts a downtrodden Hermione by dancing with her, a nice addition by Kloves that wasn't in the original book.     You can really see Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint coming into their own as actors. Watson is perhaps the best out of the three, carrying so many emotions at one time it's hard to keep up. Grint does an equally commendable job with Ron's conflicting emotions and his wavering faith in Harry, and often provides some well-timed comic relief. Radcliffe seems to be more comfortable in his role than the previous films, and as a consequence, Harry seems to have matured considerably, growing as a person and developing another layer of depth and complexity that adds even more interest to his character. For instance, after the face-off with Nagini at Godric's Hollow, Hermione shows Harry the bits of his broken wand. Instead of blowing up at her and acting like an ungrateful prig as he does in the book, he acts far moreaccepting, actually thanking her for saving their lives instead of bawling her out.     Even though many, many technical advancement have been made since the earlier movies, I found the special effects for this one a bit too cartoonish. Dobby and Kreacher's faces looked far too human to be house-elves, and not quite as magical as in films 2 and 5. The shadow-puppet-like animation for tale of the Three Brothers was very odd, and I felt it detracted from the story too much.    Of all of the alterations made to the plot, my one complaint was that Kloves chose not to spare Dobby, the poor, good-natured house-elf who gets mercilessly killed at Belltrix's hands, an unnecessary moment from the book that really galled me. In the film, it was painful to watch Harry call out to Hermione to help him, and watch as she does nothing. Rowling frequently contradicts herself, and this was one of the worst.  How is it Hermione could stop Ron from bleeding to death after he was splinched, or save Harry from a near-fatal snake bite, yet she can't help a house-elf that was wounded with an ordinary dagger? It would have been such an easy change--I really wish the film had ended better.     As a movie, I can't complain. It had good acting, good cinematography, fairly good music, good visual effects, and a great production crew. It was a marked improvement from the book itself, and while maybe not as marked as I would have liked, it is nonetheless something I would consider re-viewing. If it lacks, it is in no way the fault of the filmmakers. They did the best they could with the material given to them. Let's just hope the next time around (Part 2), will improve upon the source instead of slavishly adhering to it.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book drew me in from the beginning. Very interesting, although sad in many parts. You really sympathize with the main character Katniss. I can't wait to start the next book in this series.
1936594293|5.0|This was my third or fourth reading of P&P--every five or six years I have to go back to it to become reacquainted with Darcy, Lizzie, Lady Catherine and of course Mr. Collins and Mrs. Bennett.  They all hold up beautifully:  gloriously pompous, spectacularly arrogant, continually conniving and of course proud and prejudiced.  There is so much to enjoy:  language, wit, style and plot all converge to create, to my way of thinking, the best novel of the 19th century.<br /><br />Academicians all seem to prefer Emma, some folks like Sense and Sensibility more.  But for me, P&P is a cut above.  Call it what you will--a comic novel, a novel of manners--there is such energy and joy in Austen's humor and wit.  Never censorious, even the most pompous and disagreeable have a reason for being--not really harmful, they just move the plot along to its terrific denouement.<br /><br />If it has been awhile since you have read it, give it another read.  Not only will you not be disappointed--I think you will be continually amazed that two hundred years later, Pride and Prejudice still works its magic.
B001TH16DS|5.0|Great set.  The Picutre Quality is great. It's nice that you can switch from the original effects to the enhanced effects.  I'm not the type of person to watch extras so I can't really comment on them.  If your intrested in that I'm sure there is a 4 page review that someone has written.  One reviewer did comment on the fact that the disc contents are hidden behind a disc.  I never really noticed before, but now that I look at it the contents for the final few discs are hidden (Oh well).
1451539401|4.0|Sense and Sensibility is very good--but as one of Austen's earliest works, it's just not her best.  That's not a criticism, merely an opinion.  And wherever one thinks this falls in the Austen cannon, everyone should read S&S.  Because even when Austen is not at her best, she's is much better than most 19th century authors.  There is the humor and romance one comes to expect in a JA yarn, however here it is not so finely honed.  Also, there are no minor characters of the caliber of Lady Catherine de Bourgh or Mr. Collins. However, most novels don't have minor characters as compelling, so again chalk this up as observation.<br /><br />The one rub I do have with the plot is Elinor's love for Edward Ferrars.  Frankly, Edward is more than a bit of a drip, and it is hard to imagine him inspiring love much less devotion.  A bit more believable but still odd is Marianne's transformation (after recovering from death's door because of a broken heart).  Once truly, madly, deeply in love with Willoughby, after a period of convalescence and introspection she transfers her affections to the not-it-the-least alike Col. Brandon.  It's rather pat, and though plausible, it is just barely so.<br /><br />It is a vast improvement over Northanger Abbey, JA's earliest work; showing the writer to be well on her way to the style and substance of her later masterpieces.
1453757430|5.0|The wealthy Mrs. Emily Inglethorp is the center of her universe.  On her estate, the Styles, there is, of course, her husband Alfred.  Actually he is her second husband; her first husband had passed on, leaving her with his estate and two sons: Lawrence and John.  Both are grown up now, but are still living with her.    Lawrence is the younger son, is somewhat taciturn, remains single, and once was a student of medicine ...    John seems unimaginative, is unhappy about the size of his allowance, and is married to Mary.  Unfortunately, their marriage is showing signs of fracture - Mary has been spending a lot of time with that mysterious doctor Bauerstein who specializes in poisons ...    Emily is quiet fond of Cynthia: her protegee.  Cynthia was a poor orphan, but now she is all grown up and works as a nurse in a dispensary which is well stocked with poisons ...    And then there is Evelyn - Emily took her on to do odd jobs.  Much to Emily's annoyance, Evelyn begins filling her ear with poisonous talk about her husband's trysts ...    And lastly, there is Mr. Hastings.  He is taking advantage of his convalesce from the war to visit his old friend John.  Luckily, he had arrived just in time for Emily's big charity event for the war.  For the affair, Emily had invited a group of Belgian refugees to attend.  As it often happens in life, one of Hastings' dear old friends - whom he hadn't seen in years - M. Poirot, the famous private detective, is among them.    The planned charity affair will go off without a hitch, unfortunately, there is a second planned event about to befall someone in a most convulsive way ...    Overall, this is a wonderfully complex story.  There are clues and red herrings galore.
1594202842|5.0|Like countless others who are reading this book, I first read it through the excerpt on the Wall Street Journal.  I linked it on facebook and received tons of comments from both Asian and non-Asian friends.    I can see why the excerpt was so controversial, because it was not a balanced excerpt!  But I did find it entertaining and it made me want to read the book even more.  Isn't that what a preview should do?    Anyhow, I read the book within a day, and I find Chua's voice to be brutally honest.  She knows that her methods of parenting are not popular and she could have sugar coated everything, but she didn't.  She wrote exactly what she did, how she reacted, and also how she changed.  The book also made me think of my own childhood, and also made me wonder how I will end up parenting my future children.    Chua didn't write this book to be a guide book, but she wrote it as a memoir.  I love how she uses the Chinese zodiac signs to determine her and the children's personality, because my friends, sisters, and I do the exact same thing.      Anyhow, it's a really good read that does give an insight into why many Asian children are so successful academically and musically.  It also shows that the same parenting method may not work for all children.
1599218011|5.0|1st, Kris is hilarious.  You can't be female and NOT connect with her funny little insights or observations about life.  From the first chapter she sweeps you into a wonderful sisterhood.  But don't worry, boys, you'll find it funny and inspirational too.

0307266303|5.0|Wake up call!  In \\"Born To Run\\" the reader is taken on an unforgettable journey, tagging along like a fly on the wall with some unforgettable characters.  McDougall does exactly what I was hoping for in this book--not only inspire me to get running again, but to go into detailed studies and evidence supporting not only barefoot running, but running long distances in general.  Often times we're told that running is not good for us, and this book is the antithesis to that train of thought.  We're simply doing it wrong.    The characters, as I've noted, are a wonderful if not bizarre mix.  From the young party animals to the mysterious Caballo Blanco, each brings about a significant part to the story.  It's funny how at the end of each scenario, it's almost playing out exactly as I personally was hoping they would--and I will not divulge more information than necessary.    When I read a book on ultrarunning, as this is, I'm looking for inspiration, motivation, and to be moved.  This book was majorly successful on each of these fronts.  It's very readable, and McDougall comes off as the type of guy you could strike up a random conversation with at a bar anywhere on the face of the planet--just seems like a cool dude.    All things considered, this was an uplifting and thoroughly likable book that will warrant repeated reading in the years to come.    One gripe:  I believe the author took a few too many stabs at Karnazes--I get it, you think he's in it for the money, and he may very well be.  He's not among the elite ultrarunners in the world like Jurek.  If Jurek wrote a book, I'd read it, too.  Karnazes has inspired a lot of people.

0767827791|3.0|I have always been a big fan of this movie, and, like many others, the dance sequence between the two stars is marvelous.  BUT, when you watch the movie on a flat screen (plasma) TV, it borders on a waste of time.  The aspect ratio of the opening scenes is full scale (2.55), but when the movie gets going, all you get is 1.33.  My VHS version does the whole thing in letterbox, a MUCH better format.  But with this CD, even the opening scenes at 2.55 are 'scrunched down' on BOTH the top and bottom of the screen, making the picture really small.  I pitched my CD out.  Waiting for the wide-screen version that flat screen TVs were made for!

B003VB5E2E|3.0|I accidently placed disc two in the player and Derek Trucks started off with Susan Tedesco.  The first song sounded like a old Allman Brothers song but I just could not place.  It wasn't and was excellent. It was written by one of Derek's back uip singers.  They followed that with \\"Coming Home\\" from Delaney and Bonnie written by Eric Clapton and Bonnie Bartlett.  It continued on with Warren Haynes joining them with \\"Soul shine\\"; David Hildago & Cesar Rojas (Los Lobos) doing the Allman's \\"Please Don't Keep Me Wandering.\\"<br /><br />Buddy Guy came on with Johnnie Lang and Ronnie Wood.  I really thought this would be good but........it dragged on the first song and \\"Miss You\\" was horrible and sounded like teenagers jamming.  It was an instrumental and it went on way too long.<br /><br />Then we get the incredible Jeff Beck doing \\"Hammerhead\\" followed by what makes this whole DVD worth it, \\"Nessum Dorma.\\"  OMG is all I can say!!!!!<br /><br />Clapton comes out and does the usual but I \\"Shot the Sherriff\\" has an incredible solo.<br />Finally Steve Winwood does \\"Had to Cry Today\\"; Voodoo Chile\\" and \\"Dear Mr. Fantasy.\\"<br />The end is BB King and the whole group doing, \\"The Thrill is Gone.\\"  And it ran on too long and was boring<br /><br />Disc One is just so so.<br />Sonny Landreth is incredible but poor song selections.  Followed by Robert Randolph who continually repeats his licks over and over and over, get it?<br />Cray, Vaughn, and Hubert Sumlin do two songs and again boring.<br />ZZ Top did not sound on.<br />Doyle Bramhall II is awesome and I loved his style with Arc Angels but these two songs were let's say, \\"interesting.\\"<br />On and on.  Nothing new and as excellent as Bill Murray was on the other Crossroads he is very distracting and predictable here.<br />Overall enjoyable with some 5 star moments and some zero moments.
B0036EH3XE|1.0|The true mystery of Lost is the mystery of HOW such seemingly great writers became so lost themselves.  How could the same writers who crafted such brilliant stories, characters and myths for five seasons, completely, and I mean COMPLETLEY, screw up the last season so badly?  It's like season's 1-5 were written by geniuses with multiple PhDs and season six was written by kindergarteners.  Season 6 is THAT bad.  No knock on kindergarteners, BUT... Where was the brilliant writing?  Why was virtually everything that was built up in 1-5 completely ABANDONED!!!???  It's like Season 6 had NOTHING to do with 1-5.  And the writers had EVERYTHING in place to create a mind-blowing finish to the series.  Jacob and his MIB brother SHOULD have been God and the Devil, Aliens from another planet, some beings that were powerful, significant and meaningful with clear and definitive purposes, goals, powers and weaknesses.  Jacob SHOULD NOT have been killed off at the end of 5.  And Season 6 should have been simply Jacob, MIB, Linus and Widmore all battling for control of the island with our great heroes, the awesome survivors, in the middle of it all and the fate of the entire world at stake!!!  And the heroes saving the island and the world (or not!).  Now THAT would have been a fantastic final season!  Instead we got meaningless, unexplainable, unsatisfying drivel that makes zero logical sense.  If I said I HATED Season 6 it would be too kind, too much praise.<br /><br />If you have not seen Season 6 yet, DO NOT watch it!  Do yourself a huge favor and consider 1-5 the entire series.  Season 6 will ruin the entire Lost experience for you.  I know it sadly did that to me.

1594202842|5.0|Amy Chua's book is not a \\"How to Parent\\" book. It is the story of one mother and her devotion and love for her children and the trials, troubles, joys and accomplishments they experience together, as well as what they learn about each other. It is a joy to read (her wit is superb) and her criticisms of American parenting are more valid than her critics want to admit. Some parts will make you cringe while others will make you laugh out loud. The entire text should make us think.    There was a time in this country when there were more Tiger Mothers (and Dads, teachers, coaches) and they were not all from China. Back in the days when children were still expected to obey, respect others (especially elders), and do well in school. A time when self-esteem was something you built from doing well at the tasks set for you. And these Tigers pushed and pulled and criticised and shamed and threatened and demanded in order to get more when you thought you had no more to give. It was often not fun and sometimes seemed unfair. However, they understood something that as children we did not, and that is that we really did not know what was best for us. Moreover, we almost always discovered we could go farther, do better, or learn more than we thought we could because someone cared enough to push us beyond our comfort zone.    America's children today could do with a wee bit more Tiger and a little less Barney. The simple fact is that when you grow up and join the world you have to carry your own water and overcome the challenges and obstacles you encounter in order to succeed. And that takes strength and discipline and not the therapeutic coddling of ribbons for 5th place, awards for perfect attendance, and feeling good about yourself when you have scored lower in academics than your peers in most other developed nations. A harsh truth is that in life second place is the first loser.
B0042JTDXK|2.0|I must be missing something - there is nothing illuminating about this compilation. Josh Groban can do so much better than this. I was hugely disappointed as I listened to song after song. It is possible that Imight have to get my courage up to listen to it again and maybe, just maybe, find a reflection of the Josh Groban that I learned to admire. For right now I am fighting a huge disappointment - Maybe I am wrong, but even the cover photo seems a bit dreary, dark, and cold. Next time I will listen to pre-views before I purchase.

Very confusing, the explanation must've come during the 20 minutes that I literally fell asleep during this movie. I rented it from the red box for a buck, I wouldn't give another buck to see it again. Kind of reminded me of The Matrix movies which were by the way excellent, at least they were \\"somewhat of a believable fantasy\\" being physically hard wired to a main computer system.

This is not what a super hero movie is supposed to be! Plus I don't know how many times I was completely lost in the story. It seems like a lot of recent movies are just filled with violence, a jumbled up story, but great special effects, and that gives these films 4 and 5 stars?! Not in my book, just take a look back on the earlier super hero movies.

B003VS0CX8|4.0|This is a beautiful DVD of a great movie. I don't have a Blu-ray player, just a DVD player. However, I bought this Blu-ray/DVD combination set based on the excellent reviews and because I assumed that the Blu-ray and DVD would have the same extra features, like interviews and movie trivia. Well, the DVD does not have everything the Blu-ray does (had I read the fine print on the description, I would have known this beforehand, so it's no fault of Amazon)! I was a bit disappointed that the DVD does not include the Christopher Plummer and Julie Andrews commentaries, nor does it really offer anything in terms of trivia and background about the movie. That said, the movie itself on the DVD, which was apparently re-mastered, looks sharp, crisp, and beautiful. You just should know before you buy this that if you don't own a Blu-ray player that you're not going to get all the little extra features, like interviews, that you might expect.

I encourage anyone who is serious about getting their life and health on the right track to purchase this book, make a green smoothie and read, read, read. Then put it all in practice on a daily basis. Your life will change!! Thank you, Kris.
1594202842|5.0|I am shocked at the number of people who have commented on this book before reading it (I'm also shocked by the poor prose, spelling, and punctuation- but that is another issue).      This book, to me, is one woman's story about instilling hard work and discipline in her daughters. About building up their self esteem by showing them how much they are capable, not by telling them how \\"special\\" and wonderful they are... REAL self esteem.      This book, to me, is not a hit piece on other styles of parenting:  to each their own.  Raise your kids anyway you want to, but don't try to silence another voice just because it doesn't comport with the style you've adopted.    Professor Chua is a fantastic writer, a brilliant woman, and a thoughtful professor.  You'd be an absolute fool to read an excerpt of any book and think you understand the book as a whole-  you'd be an even bigger fool to think that about a book written by a brilliant professor familiar with the art of sarcasm, self deprecation, humor, and nuance.
B0036TGSIK|5.0|Everything about this movie really surprised me, because it was a totally different teen comedy experience in my opinion. The movie is filled with so much random comedy, but it does have purpose and that is what I love about it. I went to school throughout the 90's-early 2000's and I think teens can really relate to this movie because it deals with one of the most major impacts that is now a huge part of society, which is text messaging and facebook. Rumors are spread around the schools like wildfire faster than ever thanks to social networks and texting. Privacy is sacrificed more and more as each day passes and this film definitely gives a \\"it's none of business!\\" vibe to the main character and it is well deserved for her.<br /><br />Whether you liked it or not, although I really do not see how anyone could not like this movie, it will become one of the best movies of this new decade. Films like \\"10 things I hate about you\\" and \\"She's All That\\" were great teen films but they were more fit for the 90's and I think films like this will be more like what we will be seeing in the near future.
B00003JRCQ|4.0|If you are a Jane Austen fan, this movie is a must-have for your collection. Great storyline. The dvd arrived on time and in good condition.
B001GCUER0|5.0|DVD is a great venue for watching Mad Men without commercial interruption and with amazing commentary.  The show is a perfect example of great television.  Characters who have depth and provide a voice to a deeper inner insight into human character.  Great sets that highlight the best of early 60s design and clothes that set off the time period in a interesting manner.  I was put off by the 1st season a bit because of the coldness I saw in the characters and saw them as archetypes rather than more human.  This season the show really seems to get going and becomes more interesting.  I enjoyed every bit of it.
B000ZM1MG4|5.0|The item arrived in good shape and on time. The anniversary edition has a great \\"making of\\" bonus that I have really enjoyed watching.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|i liked this book and thought it was a good sequel to the last....but... WHY DID SHE PICK PEETA?!?! ...i REALLY hoped she would pick gale.. because i thought they were a better match.. faught together, hunted together, ..etc. peeta just was a lunatic at the end.  (which by the way, i did not like how the author made peeta like that and have his love for katniss just dissapear in a confusion act.)
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I am not one to leave verbose reviews and I will keep this short. I have read all of Sanderson's works aside from the WOT. This is simply his best work yet. I would easily rate this book up in the tops of the fantasy epics I have read. Wow just WOW. I CANNOT WAIT for the rest of the series, I almost feel like I exited a door when I came to the last page of this wonderfully crafted world.     Those of you who have read him know he creates worlds that are alive and not full of the same old tired elves, dwarves and wayward men. This book did not disappoint, he manages to craft several dozen groupings of man and creature that a reason for existing. The wanna be epic writers who use the same old formula must tremble when they read Sanderson. He is a genius, I will not lie, I literally read this whole book in a weekend I just couldn't put it down.     Buy it, love it, and have no regrets!!!     Now if you excuse me, I have two days of tardy chores to catch up with.
0393327345|3.0|I love Chuck's books but will admit that although fight club is one of my all time favorite movies, the book is not even in my top 5 books taht Palahniuk has written.  Maybe it was the movie the ruined the book for me and had I read the book first I would have had a different opinion, but I just didn't feel the book to be nearly as interesting or well put together.  All that said, still a very interesting book and worth the read.
B003L20ICE|3.0|The kids are definitely all right. But the story is just a little off as far as lesbian love is being played out. That is why [[ASIN:0790741822 Boys on the Side]] will always be top 5 on my list of lesbian love films. When did they become a regular family with all the inequalities of the male-female rules? I understand nobody has got this life thing figured out but love can be in any form and diffirent for anyone. It does not have to be the same pattern for everyone especially marriage which at the current time is the \\"ultimate\\" expression of LOVE.<br /><br />The film as an art form is very enjoyable in terms of acting and cinematography. I most definitely love the outdoor shots and scenes. I would urge people to see this for Julianne Moore.
1400049628|1.0|I love zombie novels and I realize this is not a novel, but I don't get how this book was so popular.  Let me say that his  book \\"world war Z\\" is one of my favorites and I highly recommend this, but reading this book I felt..... well, I felt like I could have written this.  The material is simply not interesting in the manner in which it is provided.
B003O8MXE6|2.0|The origal book ordered never arrived.<br />The delivery dates given by Amazon were hopelessly wrong.<br />The book finally arrived about 3 months after the original order was placed.<br />Good point - no hassles about replacing the book and the replacement arrived in a short time.
0307388921|4.0|This is another where I saw the movie first (same with fight club) but in this case I felt the book was as good as the movie.  It is a fast read and one that will keep you very entertained.
B003J27WFW|5.0|I am going to be short and to the point. This is a great doc on Rush and just a great doc in the music field of docs. I would say that even if you are not a Rush fan you can enjoy this very well made doc. I gave two of these as presents I liked this so much. If you like Rush you will love this. If you just want to see a great music doc you will like this. Just so very well made.
1405240466|4.0|Love the box set and the plastic sotrage box is reuseable.  Our only issue was the books are SMALL.  They are about half the size of the Little Miss books you'd buy individually.  I'm sure the product info stated this.  I just didn't realize the size difference when I purchased.  Shipping was fast.
B0034G4P7Q|4.0|When I first heard about this movie I did not really care because so what he made a website. In a way though, this movie has nothing to do with Facebook. The main character does a great job and Justin Timberlake adds to the performance of the supporting actors. The soundtrack to the presentation is truly stellar. This is a great movie for the younger generation, it teaches you to go after your dreams and do not give up. Also how to react towards people around you and how keeping the wrong people in your life can backfire and how a person could be so smart but so dumb when it comes to other things. The thing I like most that seems to relate to the real creator of Facebook in real life is that he thinks of something and he stays to it no matter what, its not about the money not about getting girls or becoming famous, he lets people around him worry about that to him its about creating this website and getting people to join and enjoy it. It is crazy to see someone that young make so much money but it is inspiring that someone his age can have a dream and have it translate to that much success and regardless if you use Facebook or not you have to admit that very few things have impacted so many people all across the world whether it be good or bad. It is a type of movie where you watch it and you want to watch it again. If you have any business in you it teaches you how any move can make or break you and once you do reach your goals a lot of people will be there to take them away from you. Overall great movie and a must see, so definitely give it a shot if you haven't already.
0143118420|2.0|Well, it's a book about an author setting off to write a book... and searching for content.  While I won't bash this book, as  a male reader, I was warned that I would probably be turned off by the double-standards and mostly feminine issues, and in all honesty, that didn't really particularly bother me.  The things that I took away from the book that improved me were the ideas that there is more to life than the rat race, and however you choose to find happiness is really fine as long as it works for you.  What works for her will probably not work for me, but I'm not to judge her methods, just her results.  In the end, I thought she accomplished what she wanted... to have some \\"me\\" time and gather enough material to write a book.  Why I wouldn't recommend the book is simple, there wasn't anything unique here.  Even though it's a true story apparently doesn't make it feel more real and in my humble opinion, there are fiction stories that will drive home these lessons and be more poignant at the same time.  In the end, I'm not surprised that you can find happiness by living in the three most luxurious places in the world where some people never even get a chance to visit.  But that worked for her, and I'm glad that it did.  But for me, I would've taken away much more if the circumstances hadn't been ideal, but someone still found enlightenment.
B000AP04OM|5.0|I am still waiting to receive this item, Sound of Music - two disc anniversary DVD.  I tried contacting them that I have not received it yet.  I would appreciate your help.   Evangeline Schaper
B00127RAJY|5.0|A friend of mine recommended this DVD. She has been doing the workouts for about 4 months and has dropped about 30lbs by also watching her caloric intake. I have done the level 1 workout three days in a row and I feel sore in every body part. I'm an athletic girl who hasn't been working out consistently for the past year or so. This really gives you a full body workout and incorporates cardio, too. I don't have any weightloss results to brag about yet because I just started it. From my first impression, this DVD is motivating, effective (based on how sore I am) and it's only about 25 minutes from start to finish. I LOVE that it's not too long. I get bored easily and the routine in this DVD isn't boring. Seems like a great DVD to kick start your fitness goals and get you motivated to increase your endurance and lose weight.
0812550706|5.0|I have always admired Card's work, and Ender's Game is the first of his books I read.  The author has a deftness with language which produces adventure, psychological thriller and a coming of age story rolled into one.  It is a book that has followers both young and old - a book about children, but not written as a children's book. A book about an exceptionally intelligent boy whose talents are developed, challenged and schooled through intensive training.  A book about a world, maybe not so distant from the one we are in now, where the limitless potential of the young is recognised, tested for and cultivated. I would recommend this book to anyone - well written, fast paced, incredibly creative and a great read.
B00192IV9U|4.0|As a longtime fan of MJ since the beginning I have every album ever released i know a lot of people don't like music being released after an artists death but the album has some great songs a good addition to the Michael Jackson library.if there are anymore great michael songs left in the vaults like these i hope they are released one day on a box set.Michael is such an influence on me as a singer i want to hear any singing or songs he ever did.when i heard this album was coming out i was so happy that there were new Mj songs coming out.was it worth the wait mostly yes. this album has some new songs mike was working on and some were leftover demos or outakes from the Thriller Bad era which were remixed.a lot of these songs are better than the last album Invincible which was michael's weakest album and had 2 or three good songs total.there are a few songs which sound like hits on the radio if they are released as singles. the best of these tunes are Best Of Joy what a great vocal and melodie, I Like The Way You Love Me very beautiful singing by Michael ,the Lenny Kravitz duet I Can't Make It Another Day which is a Dirty Diana part II rock song and Behind The Mask which sounds like a Thriller or Bad era song great song.Much To Soon is very sad and haunting also and Hollywood Tonight is very danceable and catchy.the weak songs are Monster ,Breaking News and Hold My Hand.just for the 5 great songs I mentioned that i hear on my ipod everyday it's worth the price of the disc.i give it 4 stars for just these songs reccomended to any lover of MJ.
B00005JKHN|5.0|The DVD case wasn't hardly worn at all!!  The DVD had no scratches.  And it was used!  I received it right on time.  Would definitely recommend this buyer again.
0756405890|5.0|Great new author. He has the talent it takes to create a new world and make you feel like you are part of it. I am looking forward to next book in the trilogy.
B000I2J6K0|1.0|Thankfully, I only borrowed this from the library--would have been highly disappointed had I purchased at ANY price.  I am only 2 months along, in fairly decent shape, but haven't been active for a few months and want to get back into routine.  First of all, she does not let you know what equipment you will need (see other reviews) to do this, and I really hated pausing to get what I needed as the video progressed.  I couldn't do 2 of the exercises because 1.) I do not have a chair that is wide enough to properly do the triceps bends (I'm not a big person, I just apparently have skinny dining room chairs!) and 2.) I do not have a big expanse of bare wall readily available to do the push-ups moves and still be able to see the video.  The so-called \\"warm-up\\" is WAAAAY too intense, especially if you are out of routine like me.  She changes moves too often, very annoying.  It gets a bit better after the crazy warm-up, as she actually explains the moves somewhat.  Like another reviewer mentioned, she doesn't tell you how many counts to do most of the time, then suddenly counts down once in a while.  It is not a fun video, and the challenge of it lies more in trying to keep up with all the switching moves and figure out modifications (if possible) for not having the exact same living room setup as she does than the actual workout routine.  Will be taking this one back right away and hunting for an easier to follow video that doesn't prompt me to 'pause if you need to pee'.
B000002KIK|5.0|Out of all the Sabbath albums with Ozzy, Never Say Die receives the heaviest criticism, generally for the ambitious experimentation and lack of straight-forward heavy metal/heavy rock songs.  Long ago, I had mixed feelings about it because even though I liked the album, it didn't seem to measure up to their first few releases.  Then I'd read about the band's turmoil during the songwriting and recording process, and that fed into the perception that this was a lesser album than the others.  In the last decade or so, I've changed my opinion completely about Never Say Die.<br /><br />I realized over time that the eight Sabbath albums with Ozzy should be split into two groups.  The first four releases fit together comfortably; heavy sludge, early metal, some bluesy rock influences from their Earth days.  Then things changed with Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, most notably the increased prominence of keyboards, piano, and orchestral arrangements.  From this standpoint, the four albums starting with SBS  and ending with Never Say Die fit together stylistically in a similar fashion to the first four.  So where does Never Say Die rank among that second group?<br /><br />In my opinion, at the top.  I know, fans of Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, which seems to be the most popular of the last four records with Ozzy, will dismiss the notion that Never Say Die is a better album, or that it even comes close.  I say judge by the strength of the individual songs and the overall feel of the albums, and they come out pretty close.  Never Say Die features five or six songs that are among my favorites in their catalog; the title track, Johnny Blade, Junior's Eyes, Shock Wave, and Swinging the Chain (with Bill Ward on vocals, sounding to me  a bit like early 70's Ozzy).  The other songs, A Hard Road, Air Dance, Over to You, and the instrumental Breakout, keep me thoroughly interested, if not enthralled, with every second of the album.<br /><br />I love SBS, Sabotage, and Technical Ecstasy, but, to me anyway, all three of those albums have moments that lag, and I very occasionally find myself a little bored (parts of Sabbra Cadabra, Looking for Today, Supertzar, Am I Going Insane, It's Alright).  As I can listen to Never Say Die and not experience any such moments, I feel like that is enough to put it slightly ahead, in terms of an overall album, of the three other Sabbath releases that are similar in style.  It might not have an individual classic as strong as the SBS title track or Symptom of the Universe, but I prefer overall quality to two or three \\"greatest hits\\" (although I do think that Johnny Blade, Junior's Eyes, and Shock Wave should be included in that category).  To be clear, I don't think any of these albums are far apart at all, and I'm only giving a slight advantage to Never Say Die, but that slight advantage gives it far more credit than many other Sabbath fans, and music critics in general, think it deserves.  Hopefully time will see it gain more popularity.those albums have moments that lag, and I very occasionally find myself a little bored (parts of Sabbra Cadabra, Looking for Today, Supertzar, Am I Going Insane, It's Alright).

0316098337|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book, most especially from the perception of Jack.  It was interesting his view of being in Room since it was all he ever knew.  I was disappointed in the ending because it made me want more.  I felt that the book could have easily been another 200 pages or so just to see how Jack's life changed with assimilation into society.
B004AQR29C|5.0|Are you into no stop and majorly over the top action? Who among us isn't?! Best action I've seen in longer than I can remember. Please don't be pompus or confused and try to make this something it is not. The best action stars of yesterday and today cramed into one long fight with plenty of guns knives bad guys and gas and what do you get? An action fans wet dream!
B0034G4P7Q|3.0|When it was released, the story of Facebook was not of a subject that would compel me to go sit in a theater and watch it for two hours. So I decided to wait for the DVD. I'm glad I did. The hype on the cover box alone puts me off this movie. It is not nearly a \\"landmark film.\\" It will be a shame if it wins best picture over True Grit or some of the other truly excellent films of 2010. The Social Network was a fine movie, interesting, spellbinding in places. But it was also pretentious, over-wrought, and full of itself, much like Facebook's founder. I most definitely do not think it was the best picture of the year.

0307595579|5.0|This boxed set of Larsson's Trilogy is a great price and fantastic read.  I read the 3 books in a little over a week.  They are very intriguing and different from what's on the market.  I got a little bogged down with all the Sweedish streets, names, and also the political verbiage, but realized it's merit. . . . just not my cup of tea.  However, the story line the characters and the way the tale was woven was amazing.  Lisbeth, a total misfit without social skills somehow became looked upon affectionately which is strange to say the least.  Mikael was lovable from the start. . . which also was a reoccurring theme!  I found myself enjoying the books in retrospect and really appreciating the characters.  I was pleased with the small book, \\"On Stieg Larsson\\" that put together the information about the author.  A number of my friends read the books, one at a time and had little information about the author.  I felt understanding Stieg's life helped me put it all together.  What a shame that he died so young.  I am curious if anything will be done with his unfinished book 4 and groundwork for book 5.  I could see Natalie Portman of Angelina Jolie playing Lisbeth in the Broadway version.  As I read the books, I often pictured Angelina.  The others already selected for this version look well suited for the roles.  Amazon did a good job with this one!
0446195529|3.0|I'm glad to read reviews that state the book is good, but am also disturbed by those who feel that Kindle readers complaining about cost have no right to express those feelings.  eBooks are definitely part of the future and the the future is now.  Charging exorbitant prices for books that require no printing and than can not be loaned to another is ridiculous.  I love my Kindle and I love Mr. Baldacci's books, but I DO NOT love paying prices higher than printed matter for an electronic version.  I do not blame Amazon for the publishers choice of charging these prices, but I'll tell you that I'll not spend that much money for an eBook.  If that brings down the rating of a book, so be it.  There is no where else Kindle owners can bring this issue to light.  So sorry to bother you paper book readers, but soon, if not already, electronic books will be outselling your paper books and we need some equality of pricing . . .
B0034G4P7Q|4.0|I was very surprised at how good this film came out to be. I bought it based on word of mouth only and have to say that I am very happy I did. I have not checked the bonus features out on disc two, but have to say that I will watch this again. Not a Netflix, certainly a buy.
1416550550|3.0|I agree with many of the reviews that I have read.  The book is a real page turner.  However there is a lot of changing back and forth while everyone is trying to solve the family puzzle.  It was confusing dealing with Eliza in 1975--switching back to Cassandra and the multiple story lines in the past.<br /><br />For a book about fairy tales and love and family the actual story-line was great until about page 400.  I figured out the secret of who Ivory's mother was. If I can do it, I'm sure others have and that is with 150 pages left to go.  However, as far as what happens to her..., I thought it was a terrible ending and after reading 500 plus pages was disappointed.<br /><br />The bottom line for me is that Ms Morton's book house at Riverton was a much better read and I would pass on this one.  The book had too many pages to have such an unsatisfactory ending.  Rarely in a fairy tale does the evil stepmother ultimately win out.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  A good story and some fun \\"facts\\" about mankind's running history.  I'm inspired to chuck my shoes, buy some old tires, and run for bliss.
0525951652|3.0|This seems to be the author's attempt to write his own version of War and Peace, but it falls short.  There does not seem to be a single family to form a central cast of characters.  The story jumps from country to country, from character to character, and fast forwards - at one moment a character is a private caught up in a rout retreating from the enemy, and at his next appearance is a platoon sergeant in a different action on a different front.  There are thin threads connecting characters, but you seem to be jumping back and forth from one plot to another.  It was a time of turmoil, with major changes in politics and society.  For the most part it is accurate, but with a few glitches, e.g., the British never admitted to the fact that the Lusitania was carrying a cargo of munitions.<br /><br />I think that, perhaps, the author tried to cover too much in one novel.  It would have been better to focus on one family and the people they were most closely associated with, and leave out the side digressions about American gangsters, etc.  It is an interesting read, but not great literature, and not up to the level of other novels by the author.

044656740X|1.0|This book is, without a doubt, one of the worst books I've ever read.   For two main reasons:    First of all, it is really badly written - he keeps repeating the same stuff all the time and a 13year old could have a better style.     Secondly, some of the messages are highly problematic.  Kiyosaki suggests that financial literacy means being able to read numbers. I would argue that there's a lot more that goes into financial literacy. For instance how it works that \\"money works for you\\", how interest is generated and how your behavior in the market potentially affects the behavior's of others and generally other stakeholders involved.  Also, he seems to have nothing but contempt for people who do not choose his path, marking them as unintelligent and in the \\"rat race\\". It doesn't even cross his mind that people might not just \\"work for money\\", but work because it fulfills them or because they see a purpose in what they do. For these kind of people their paycheck just allows them to pay their bills and they're perfectly happy with them.     I could go on and on, but it's really not worth dwelling on this book any longer.
B003ES61EE|4.0|I love gadgets, and the simpler and more effective, the better.  As the owner of several cameras, binoculars, cell phone and other devices with small lenses, the idea and design of the Lens Pen Cleaning System caught my fancy immediately.  This simple lens cleaner consists of a pen-like holder containing two implements; on one end, a cap comes off to reveal a small (quarter inch) round rubber lens cleaner, which is completely effective and able to easily access the smallest of lenses, no matter how deep and hard to reach.  The other end contains a brush, which extends from the end of the \\"pen\\" and is sturdy and soft enough to finish the job.<br /><br />The pen easily fits into a shirt pocket, and so is handy enough to bring along with my camera, binoculars or anything else with a small, receding lens.  The only problem was that, for me, I found that the small device is easy to misplace, and I have to keep it in a \\"special\\" place to make sure it doesn't get lost.<br /><br />Definitely a clever little gadget, but don't confuse the small cleaner as a substitute for lens cloths or anything else used to clean larger lenses, like reading glasses or cell phone display screens.  For small lenses, however, I found it a very handy assistant indeed.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|I've had this bag about a week and have found that it is comfortable and fits my equipment (Nikon D5000, 35mm lens, 18-55mm lens, 55-200mm lens, SB-400, mini tripod, a couple of compact P&S cameras and the associated cables. I have a small laptop and I wish the backpack had a dedicated pocket for it. Finally, I haven't seen what type of weather this thing will hold up to. Time will tell.
B003ES61EE|5.0|I have several cameras/camcorders, and through normal use gradually got some smudges on the lenses.  This AmazonBasics Lens Cleaning System is a cheap, simple, and very effective way to get your lenses clean.  There are two things I especially like about it.  One is that it weighs practically nothing, so that you can put it in your camera bag and it adds nothing to the weight.  The other is that its pen design means that it is compact and self-contained.  One end has a brush that allows you to sweep off any dust or pollen you get on the lens.  The other end has a pad that will allow you to remove any smudges.  Simple and effective.<br /><br />As a product line - at least in the range of electronics and cameras - I find myself trusting AmazonBasics.  I've yet to encounter a product that in anyway struck me as inferior or ineffective.  The AmazonBasics products are of as high quality as any of the competitors, but as a better price.  I'm not at the point where I will check to see of Amazon has their own product before looking at other options, especially with regard to adapter plugs and computer and audio cables the like.

B003L20IJM|5.0|Really a great movie for people of all ages.  Such good characters and a great new story line tying her first movie character to this one.
B0029QRA1U|4.0|Overall, very easy to use. My mother was able to figure it out, and is now transferring all her old records to i-tunes. I told her when I was helping her set-up that she would need to get an i-pod to listen to them. She surprised me by saying she had an i-pod touch stored away for over a year! I would reccomend this product, but be ready to need an i-pod.
B000KKPN5C|4.0|I upgraded from a long list of P&S cameras to the D5000 and have been quite pleased. In fact, my only complaint with the camera is the pop-up flash. I purchased this speedlight to help eliminate the harsh shadows and washed-out tones produced by the pop-up flash. I have not been disappointed. My pictures turn out much better when I'm able to use a flash (my house is poorly lit). I have only shot indoors and have mostly taken pictures of my kids (much less motion-blur now). The light is strong so I've pointed it up at 90 degrees almost exclusively. I can see the benefit of being able to rotate the light horizontally to bounce off the ceiling in portrait mode, but I've been bouncing off the wall and like the \\"diversity\\" of light source.
030746363X|4.0|I knew about this book from an email from an email by Mike Geary, an expert in fitness and fat loss. Intrigued by his statements about the book, then I decided to visit Amazon.com. Turned out that the book was in the top positions for both the kindle version (1st position) and printed version (3rd position). So I ordered the hard copy.    When the book was arrived, I started to read the fat loss sections, and started to implement the diet method on Sunday, January 9th, 2011. Usually I got measured at my gym every Saturday for my total body weight, my body fat percentage, and my body fat weight. When I got measured on last Saturday, January 15th, 2011, the numbers were encouraging. My total body weight was decreased from 75.8 kg to 74.1 kg, and my body fat percentage was also decreased from 23.1% (equal to 17.5 kg) to 22.5% (equal to 16.7 kg).     I'm looking forward to my next measurement, since I intend to have 15% of body fat percentage.     And I'm not finished reading the book, and there are still other methods that I want to implement it, like the method using ice packs.    And I also like Tim Ferris' way of writing the book. It is an easy to read and implement book.
B000009HF2|5.0|English guitar maestro Peter Frampton's fifth album Frampton Comes Alive was released in January of 1976 (around the time I was born).<br />I grew up as a toddler/child of the 1970s/1980s digging this album thanks to my mom. Then one day after hearing the making of this classic on In the Studio, I went out in a snowstorm from college to a Strawberries Records and plunked down $12 for this kick*ss album on cassette (now I have the CD). This epic live album, over 35 years on, still rocks and does not only feature Frampton's great guitar solos and vocals and Stanley Sheldon's great bass playing but also showed us what great musicians the late great John Siomos and Bob Mayo were. John was what Peter called \\"the John Bonham of his band\\" and John's passing in January of 2004 was a sad moment and less then a month after John's passing keyboard player/occasional guitarist/backing vocalist Bob Mayo passed away after having a heart attack in Switzerland while touring with Peter. This album is a living testament to Peter's band whom played with him from 1975 to 1979.<br />This live album (unlike many live albums of its era like KISS Alive for instance) was completely live except for part of the vocal of \\"Something's Happening\\" (the killer opener), the rhythm electric guitar on the classic Top 10 hit \\"Show Me the Way\\" (the voice box guitar came out but the engineer failed to switch the microphones back to main amp) and the piano on \\"I Wanna Go to the Sun\\" (also a classic) but the rest of the album is all live (all guitar and keyboard solos, drums, bass and backing vocals, rest of vocals and rest of rhythm guitars).<br />This classic album features the Frampton standards \\"Show Me The Way\\" (which hit #6 on the singles charts), the Top 20 hit \\"Baby I Love Your Way\\" and the Top 20 epic \\"Do You Feel Like We Do\\" in all of its 14 minute plus glory with its famous talk-box section and he and Joe Walsh would have a great talk-box duel.<br />The other tracks \\"Doobie Wah\\", \\"It's a Plain Shame\\", \\"All I Wanna Be (Is By Your Side)\\", \\"Wind of Change\\", \\"I Wanna Go To The Sun\\", \\"Penny For Your Thoughts\\", \\"I'll Give You Money\\", his rendition of Humble Pie's \\"Shine On\\", his killer cover of \\"Jumping Jack Flash\\" and \\"Lines On My Face\\" are all superb classics!<br />In fact, much of the album was recorded at Winterland in 1975 and was to be a single disc until A&M co-founder Jerry Moss said \\"let's make a double album\\". Then with Chris Kimsey recorded the tunes that appeared on 1975's Frampton with Eddie Kramer and Chris Kimsey to the fabled Winterland gig.<br />This classic live album showed Peter Frampton and his band in all their glory. Besides being a excellent songwriter and singer, Frampton ranks as one of the greatest guitarists in all of rock and roll history.<br />This live album for the longest time was the biggest selling live album ever and was #1 for a total of 17 unconsecutive weeks making it the best selling album of 1976 hands down and sold 8 million copies Stateside to date.<br />It's unfortunate that critics panned Frampton after this album for his good looks rather than his musical talent showing critics are more about pazazz and glitter than music integrity.<br />In July of 1998, A&M re-released the album to fit the 78 or so minute live album onto one CD superbly remastered by Doug Sax (who has done much of the Pink Floyd back catalog from The Wall forward) and trumps the original sterile 1980s 2-CD issue.<br />Highly recommended!nna Be (Is By Your Side)\\", \\"Wind of Change\\", \\"I Wanna Go To The Sun\\", \\"Penny For Your Thoughts\\", \\"I'll Give You Money\\", his rendition of Humble Pie's \\"Shine On\\", his killer cover of \\"Jumping Jack Flash\\" and \\"Lines On My Face\\" are all superb classics!

It's unfortunate that critics panned Frampton after this album for his good looks rather than his musical talent showing critics are more about pazazz and glitter than music integrity.  In July of 1998, A&M re-released the album to fit the 78 or so minute live album onto one CD superbly remastered by Doug Sax (who has done much of the Pink Floyd back catalog from The Wall forward) and trumps the original sterile 1980s 2-CD issue.  Highly recommended!
B003FSTN5C|5.0|When NCIS spun off form JAG I was sure it could never be as good as JAG, but I was wrong, I liked this from the word go, nice characters fun interaction, great action, diverse plots and the occasional interplay with the east coast version
B000A7Q2DM|3.0|This is a good album. Do yourself a favor and get it. I liked half of the songs on the cd.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|They did it again! The Big Bang Theory's second season is as hilarious as it's first season. If anything, I'd say it's twice as funny.  This show is my husband's favorite and I definitely see why.  Smart-alec phrases and catchy come backs meets knock your socks off entertainment.  This show will have you glued to the television and will keep you laughing.
B001HNE3NO|3.0|When I first decided to read this I was hoping for a historical fiction as it is advertised as.  It is really more of \\"who am I\\" book for the main character.  I found the historical references to be more in support of the lead character finding her way to who she was - not so much about the past.  I was hoping it focused more on Sara and her journey, but nope more about Julia and who she wants to be as she evaluates her life.  Was ok for a boring day to read, but not what I had hoped for.  Should be more about coming of middle age - and evaluating your life.
0684847817|5.0|I have experienced faeries, devas and others all of my life. I experience them as light formations, emitting deeply emotional presence and awareness. I had never come across any sort of description or illustration of these beings that jived with my own until Brian's works. So for me, this is the real thing. Perhaps he wanders here and there in fun at times, but so much the better. Who else can you count on to reveal to you the Yellow Blurker, or the Foot Fungus Faery?<br /><br />Brian's work bears evidence to the infinite realm of faery, with gorgeous and rich illustrations and text. Or, as I mentioned before, the delightfully silly. I adore the world of fae, and wander at will throughout the pages of this wonderous book. Magic, inspiration, heart and the thrill of other worlds close at hand are all on tap for you here.
B0015DROBO|1.0|Do not understand the hype. This will make me think twice before buying a book that so many people claim is great.
0061733199|5.0|I have family that loves to go wilderness hiking and a niece in Afghanistan. I gave this book as gift(s) and everyone present found something of interest in the book. Could be a lifesaver.  Lots of pictures; easy to read. Highly recommend.

B000002ADT|5.0|Everyone will tell you if you only ever buy one jazz album in your life, it should be \\"Kind of Blue.\\" There is a reason why this seminal collection of musical improvisations from 1959 still sounds fresh through the decades whilst most popular music from the 1960s, 70s and 80s has become dated and forgotten. When you hear KOB you'll probably recognise most of it because these numbers have been played endlessly in a thousand places all over the world for 50 years and in countless movie soundtracks, and they never age.<br /><br />The musicians Miles assembled around him for these sessions were all at the top of their game: Bill Evans and Wynton Kelly on piano, \\"Cannonball\\" Adderley and John Coltrane on saxes, Paul Chambers on bass and Jimmy Cobb on drums. Davis used simple modal scales to define to the musicians the limits within which they could improvise, instead of more standard harmonic structure with chord progressions. This gives the album a loose, relaxed and super-cool feel, yet the music is complex enough to hold the listener's interest even after hearing it hundreds of times. It's one of those rare triumphs of musical genius where everything came together to produce something sublime and special. Listen and you will immediately \\"get it.\\"<br /><br />So, yet another five-star review for \\"Kind of Blue.\\" If you don't have it, then buy it. It's the essence of cool. It's great. It's timeless. It won't sit in your CD rack: it will be played, often and forever.

B001MYIXAC|5.0|I purchased this simply to allow my friend a break from my repeated requests to borrow his copy.  Outstanding cast, outstanding story, on and on and on.  I love seeing a horror movie, especially one dealing with vampires, that neither dwells on blood nor acts like it's some magic foreign fairy liquid (read: Twilight movies), yet still gets its point across.  I know the American remake was well received by both audience and critic, but I have yet to see that version -- not going to rush out, either.  A good remake is still a remake -- stick with this original.  And, as was said in one of the \\"making of...\\" shorts, this movie has one of the saddest happy endings ever.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|Supernatural!! What more needs said. The guys are hot and the show is always A+++  There are episodes that stand out, but I love the series and Season 5 was GREAT with Lucifer being released from Hell and the guys having to make the ultimate sacrifice!!  Jensen Ackles, Jared Padalecki and Misha Collins are superb!! I highly recommend this series.

B0009A21R6|5.0|This has been sitting in my wish list for over a year. Was initially put in the wish list when I was looking for SACDs to add to my collection. After reading all of the positive reviews I decide to get it. All I can say is WOW....should have purchased this a long time ago. I don't know much about Dire Straits but I do remember watching the music video \\"Money is for Nothing\\" on the MTV channel....back in the '80s. I have just finished listening to this today and the music sounds fantastic....especially with the Super Audio (5.1) format. While my favorites, Walk of Life, So Far Away and Money is for Nothing are the songs I remember and love I also really like the track \\"Your Latest Trick\\". Sounds a little like smooth jazz. If you been looking at this Cd...get it!!!!! You won't be sorry. If you have the equipment and speakers to play and listen to the Super Audio format you will experience a higher level of listening enjoyment.

0395905079|3.0|I was a little disappointed when I saw this book.  It is so large and heavy that it is difficult and heavy to hold while reading.  If I were to do it again I would either purchase a paperback or a collection of individual books.  Of course Paddington stories are delightful and we are still able to enjoy the book.
B0029LHX1W|5.0|Leo has always believed in Russia and in Stalin.  He is a former war hero who now works for the State Security Force.  He is an obedient and upright citizen, with all of the right ideas and phrases about his homeland and his leader.  As a result, he reaps all of the benefits--a lovely wife, safety and security, a nice apartment in Moscow, and an easier life for his parents.  He is confident that all of the people he arrests and dooms to torture and death are really guilty.    Then one day Leo arrests a vet who, after seeing he was being watched, goes on the run.  Leo starts to think while interrogating him that perhaps this man is really no more than a vet who got scared when he noticed he'd attracted police attention.  This foreign and dangerous thought, coupled with a brewing cold, causes Leo to become sick and incapacitated for several days.  When he returns to work, he finds that he and his family are being targeted.    With his confidence in the fairness and infallibility of the state shattered, Leo is able to allow more dangerous ideas to form.  Before long, he is investigating a series of murders of children, crimes that Russia has said absolutely do not exist.  Simply by searching for the truth, Leo is putting himself and his entire family in mortal jeopardy.    This novel is absolutely terrifying; I found myself tense just reading about what life was like in Russia, and how carefully thoughts and feelings needed to be guarded in order to remain safe.  There were some nice plot twists along the way, including the status of Raisa and Leo's marriage and the identity and motive of the serial killer.  This book was almost impossile to put down once I started reading it.    I didn't love the ending, how everything seemed to be wrapped up so neatly and happily.  It was a bit too sunny to cap off such a dark and intense novel, but everything else about the book was fantastic.
B0033AGSYG|5.0|I really enjoyed this book but I am partial to Alison Weir and all of her history writng.  When you read one of them you know that she has done her research and what you are reading is factual and well-written.  This is a great book if you want to learn about King Henry, his wives, and the people in his life.  After reading this I was finally able to understand all six of the wives, who got executed, who got divorced, etc... and why.  It's also a great book to understand the reasons behind these decisions.  I recommand any of the Alison Weir books to anyone interested in British history/royality.  [[ASIN:0345453220 The Lady in the Tower: The Fall of Anne Boleyn (Random House Reader's Circle)]][[ASIN:0345453204 Queen Isabella]]
B002ZG97EC|5.0|What a great movie! I first saw Despicable Me in the theaters, and I laughed louder than most of the children around me. I bought the DVD on amazon for my nieces, and we probably watched the dvd ten more times over the holidays. Great fun for all ages.
1400079144|1.0|I think Dan Brown's editor may have been asleep.  He should have smacked his author around (editorially speaking, of course), and reminded him he was writing a novel.    This book has some interesting stuff in it, and some hair raising stuff, too.  But any time the narrative starts to take off, Brown yanks us out of it with one of his many interminable flashbacks, discussions of Freemason lore, descriptions of memories of past discussions of Freemason lore, or philosophical ramblings, all of which bring the book to a complete halt.  By the time we get to the book's biggest revelation, I was skipping whole paragraphs and almost missed it.    To be fair, Brown's didactic style was evident in The Da Vinci Code, but he didn't sacrifice pace for information.  Emboldened by the success that book, he seems to have pulled out all the stops and INUNDATES us with arcane information, effectively keeping us constantly at arm's length to the story.  Unfortunately, this only exposes how thin and rather ridiculous the plot is.    And once the book's crisis is finally averted, everyone affected by the horrendous doings seems to brush themselves off, smile, and start lecturing again.    If you still want to read it, pace yourself; it's a looong book.

0812979656|1.0|I feel as if I've lost a battle when I can't finish a book but this one I put down after 2/3rds of the way through.  I had little empathy for any of the characters and felt removed from scenes as if I was watching from a dark hallway...one filled with filth and obnoxious smells.  A number of reviewers commented on Roy's magical style of writing...so what if it doesn't get to the point.    Read Lahiri instead.
B003NHRIVQ|1.0|I always knew Miley Cyrus was cold-hearted, but this movie lets us know she contains no emotion. Or a heart. Or a soul.<br /><br />Miley plays \\"Ronnie\\", a teenage girl who goes to live with her father, and everything becomes nauseating along the way. Miley can't even act her way out of a paper bag more than she can sing, and don't get me started on \\"When I Look At You\\". That had to be Auto-tuned in order to manage her scattered vocals and long notes.<br /><br />The movie takes the romance from the Nicholas Sparks novel and pairs her up with Liam Hemsworth. Every girl who might have been head over heels with him might have lost their interest now thanks to this movie. The way she and Liam kiss each other caused me to lose my lunch.<br /><br />And then, spoiler alert, the father is dying. So is Greg Kinnear's career.
B003UESJ9M|5.0|I love music, and country music. I also love a lot of the actors and actresses in the movie so I went expecting a \\"Pure Country\\" or even a \\"Coal Miner's Daughter\\" kind of movie.     Instead I got a movie with some exceptional acting, great music, and an amazing story.     I will first make a comparrison:  Love and Other Drugs was similiar in that it deals with a lot of human element and complexities. However, that movie was so OVERLY sexual that it watered down the emotion. And while I love Anne Hathaway and thought she did some great acting I didn't like her character. In the end I didn't think he character developed and still felt like her character was very selfish and that they both were. It was a very co-dependent relationship.     Country Strong was so much more. It was what I wanted Love and Other drugs to be. (Spoiler Alert) You wont' find a happy ending here but the complex story of Kelly Canter won't leave my mind. Paltrow was a perfect pic for this character as she almost has a sadness in her eyes, a certain quality.     Kelly Canter is a famous celebrity who's lost her way in life. After losing a baby when she fell of stage during a concert (she tripped over a mic cord, but she was intoxicated) she goes to rehab where she stays for about a year. James Canter, her husband checks her out early from rehab to help her get her career back. Kelly'd not ready to leave rehab and a friend who works at the rehab and sings at local bars and dance halls comes on tour with her- Beau.     Kelly Canter is now KELLY CANTER. Her entire being is her \\"celebrity\\" and she's no longer herself anymore. All she really wants is for James to love her. She longs to escape the life she's living but when she tries to talk to James about this he refuses to see the real Kelly anymore.     There's so much pain between them, and you watch Kelly's life jump off the tracks and spiral out of control. It's very painful at times. James and Kelly have a complex relationship that's become moreabout business and more about KELLY CANTER the headliner than Kelly Canter the woman. Kelly continues to make bad choices and it's clear she's had a mental breakdown. Only Beau can see this and while he's in love with her all of her demons push him away.     Meanwhile Chiles Stanton (Leighton Meester who does a great job) is the pageant queen girl trying to break in to stardom. She turns out to be more complex than she seems on the surface and in the end Beau falls for her. She wants the limelight though and wants to be the next Kelly Canter. Beau gets a taste of it and decides it's not for him. He can see what fame has done to Kelly. How it steals every piece of you. He just loves music and wants to go back to singing in dance halls.     James Canter will push Kelly at any cost. His love for Kelly has become so entagled in his desire for her to suceed and be KELLY CANTER that he can't see how broken she is. \\"She use to be strong. I don't know when she became so fragile.\\" he says to Beau.     There is such a struggle in this movie between two people who love each other and hurt each other in so many ways. It shows how complex a marriage can be. How complex the \\"celebrity\\" personality can be and how even those close to you can blur the lines between real and pretend.     You'll find hope at the end of the movie when two characters decide to leave that life behind. Unfortunately you'll also find pain and sadness, when sometimes it's just too late.     There is not a character in this movie that is not deeply complex. You're heart will break and bleed for them even as you watch them hurt each other and make avoidable mistakes. These characters too do selfish things to one another but what will stay with you is the pain that love can cause when it won't let go.   You'll see the intensity that is so hard to show between two people as you peel back the layers on James and Kelly's marriage.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Everyone should watch this documentary to understand how our food source system is basically controlled by a few big corporations - with the same goal - how to produce large volume with less expense and consequently, squeezing out small farmers who refuse to follow.  Amazing to know that the top officials of these companies used to work in government agencies that are also responsible for monitoring the industry. This is an eye opener - I'm now very conscious of what I buy - buying organic (and/or local) whenever possible.
0807014273|5.0|Man's Search for Meaning was first recommended to me as an undergraduate majoring in psychology but I have read it several times over the years and with each reading I come away with added perspective, personally and professionally. I tend to only rate books as five-star when I come away feeling the experience has changed my life in a significant and positive way. Dr. Frankl's book is an inspiration, thought provoking, and life changing reminder that we always have choice and kindness and compassion always matter.     As a communicator, Dr. Frankl was extremely eloquent and I found that as I was being led through his life experiences, thoughts, and perception, I was able to process his message for myself. Within the pages of this thought-provoking book, about a psychologist who was a prisoner in concentration camps during WWII, Frankl proposes spiritual liberation is possible within any experience, \\"everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms...to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way.\\"     This is one of those books that you keep on your shelf and reread from time to time. A very inspirational read, this short book is especially for those in search of life's meaning. The concepts flow logically and in a straightforward language. I recommend this book for everyone.
B004856SQ8|5.0|I grew up watching episodes of The A-Team with Mr. T and George Pepard.  This movie brings that all back with a much-needed update.  The plot is, basically, the same.  A group of commandoes gets framed and needs to clear their name.  Liam Neeson and Bradley Cooper shine as Hannibal and Face, respectively.  Murdock, in this movie, adds some comedy to it and is a good addition to the cast.  My only gripe is the fact that the red and black iconic van is not in it that much.  As I remember, that was something which was in each episode.  Jessica Biel was a good bad/good guy which one couldn't quite figure out whose side she was on.  Overall, it was a good movie and worthy of being added to any DVD or Blu-ray collection.  I, in fact, got the Blu-Ray for Christmas and it was my first Blu-Ray I ever purchased.  It's a fun ride and there are many plot twists.  The ending sequence leads one to believe there will be sequels.  I hope the same cast returns and the plot is just as good.
B0034G4P7G|4.0|This movie is very fast paced and fast moving. Not a lot of action, but lots of talking and transacting. Definitely an interesting film, and shot in an interesting way with changes between past and present. Jesse Eisenberg plays a great Mark Zuckerberg.<br /><br />I wasn't super enthusiastic about Timberlake's performance. I think he brings the same qualities to every character he plays, and is overly arrogant. He overacts his parts. But, it's not super distracting from the film so this shouldn't disaude you. Just my opinion on him as an actor.<br /><br />It's an interesting story. Not sure how factual it is in regards to some parts, but interesting none the less. The film portrays Zuckerberg as arrogant, but each of the main characters has some deep complexities.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I got this album in 2004, on the day it was released. I had been looking forward to it for a while and it greatly surpassed my expectations. To put it simply, I was blown away by the emotion behind the songs; I felt like Avril was speaking directly to me. Even at the tender age of 12, I could see what a special album this is.<br /><br />Personally, I prefer Let Go for its sentimental value, but as others have said, Under My Skin has a more mature feel to it. You can tell that Avril did a lot of growing up in just two years.<br /><br />The album hooks you right from the first song, \\"Take Me Away,\\" an awesome track with a captivating intro and heavy guitars. As you continue on your musical journey, you'll come across the girl-power anthems \\"Don't Tell Me\\" and \\"He Wasn't,\\" the catchy hit single \\"My Happy Ending,\\" the loud, emotional \\"Forgotten,\\" the surprisingly positive \\"Who Knows,\\" and the beautiful closing track, \\"Slipped Away,\\" dedicated to Avril's late grandfather. Although I love all these songs, my favorite would have to be \\"Nobody's Home.\\" A touching ode to a girl who feels lost and alone, this track has gorgeous music and vocals and might just bring you to tears.<br /><br />In short, I was extremely impressed with Avril's sophomore CD. I still listen to it today, and it means even more to me than it used to because I am almost 19, the same age Avril was when she released it. There is not one song on here that I would consider filler - I wholeheartedly recommend all of them. Also, I'm a person who likes to listen to CDs all the way through, and I feel this one isn't too long or too short (12 songs, about 40 minutes).<br /><br />Well done, Avril!!

B002BSHXJA|5.0|I bought this item for a Christmas gift and it had so much more than I originally thought.  Each disc has the original LP artwork.  Gorgeous.  The mono recordings give an incredible feel of nostalgia that can't be captured with words.  It is definitely the ultimate Beatles experience (besides seeing them live, of course, if you were so lucky).  I love the artwork with these discs and love how they have record sleeves like the old LPs.  It is definitely a great collector's item.

B0031S4K5E|5.0|Like all Miyazaki films, Ponyo is an adorable story - one you and your children are likely to remember for a lifetime. It's the story about a young goldfish who lives in the sea with many sisters, and her father, the alchemist, Fujimoto. Ponyo's mother is a beautiful sea goddess, Gran Mamare who seems to belong more to the sea than to her family, although she's there when they need her.<br />Ponyo is a very curious goldfish, and one day, while out exploring, she gets stuck in a jar. The jar floats up along the shore, where a little boy, Sosuke, finds the jar, and tries to get Ponyo out. Fujimoto goes out in search of Ponyo when he realizes she's missing, and as Sosuke is running up the hill to his house - where his mother has been calling him, Fujimoto notices that Sosuke is carrying her. He panics because he's not very fond of people, and fears what will be done to his daughter. Oh...did I mention Fujimoto is a man?  LOL  I think they explained that a bit in the movie, but not in any great detail.<br />After Sosuke finds Ponyo, she falls in love with her, and she wants to become a human girl. So that I don't ruin it all, I'll just tell you that the Sea Goddess has the power to make it happen, but it depends on whether Sosuke can love Ponya enough to make it happen.<br />Ponyo is a wonderful movie - esp if you have children. We have kids ages 20 - 8, and they all will sit and watch a Miyazaki movie. Our first Miyazaki movie was \\"Our Neighbor Totoro\\" [[ASIN:B002ZTQV8Y My Neighbor Totoro (Two-Disc Special Edition)]] We first bought it in the VHS tape version, and later bought it in the DVD version - which we usually watch several times a year, and often take with us on vacation. Delightful is a perfect word to describe these movies.  Our kids like all of the movies, but my favorites are Totoro, Kiki's Delivery Service [[ASIN:B002ZTQVLG Kiki's Delivery Service: Special Edition - 2-Disc DVD]], and now Ponyo! [[ASIN:B0031S4K5E Ponyo (Two-Disc Special Edition + Plush Toy)]]<br />We bought the 2 disk special edition with the Ponyo soft toy.<br />Highly recommended!ught the 2 disk special edition with the Ponyo soft toy.  Highly recommended!
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Ever since Q.A.F. I've admired Showtime for its originality. Except I didn't watch this show in its first run, but as each season is released, I'm finding myself compelled to buy it one season at a time. I haven't read the books, so I'll base my critique on what I know from the show, so far-I'll also review the seasons as I complete them.  Michael C. Hall plays Dexter Morgan, Jennifer Carpenter plays his adopted sister Debra Morgan. Yes, Dexter is a serial Killer, but does it by a code-never kill an innocent person and never get caught. Interested, yet?  After some research on my computer-I found it very cliched that this show has received some criticism when brought to CBS. First off the violence isn't that graphic, the language and sexual content is more constant, sometimes.  I'm so sick and tired of right-wing activists blaming the media for real-life violence, without doing their homework first.  To me, Dexter is a vigilante, in other words, he catches the criminals the police can't, so yeah, I do root for his work continuing. When I first started this show-3 years ago) I was very impressed with the scripts and storylines. The finale episode made my mouth drop. As Dexter's past becomes clear, it's obvious he was traumitized as a child, among other factors, typical of a serial killer, however, you can't de-humanize him based on being a s. killer because every killer case is different, different factors fall into play every time. After starting Criminal Minds-I've learned a few things about criminals-no two are exactly alike.  I'm not giving much of a description here, because so many others already have, and I agree, within reason, however, obviously I can't recommend this for kids, duhhh!

044656740X|5.0|Anyone who wants to improve their financial status and understanding of why they are having financial problems should read this book. I believe every parents should discuss these principle with their children.
B000V86OKG|5.0|This season took some turns I didn't expect. In this one, you see a somewhat more human-side to \\"him\\" Rita, played by Julie Benz, forces Dexter into rehab after figuring out one of his secrets-where he meets Lila, an addict of a different form. She's willing and able to accept him when she finds out his true nature. The plot continues to thicken as the Feds come to Miami to track down the Harbor Bay Butcher-led by Keith Carridine, and Det. Doaks is closer to discovering Dexter's secret. I won't give anything else away just in case. Suffice to say, this season was better than the first one, the acting is still top notch, along with the scripts. If you liked the first season, this one is more than worth your time.
B0006B2A42|5.0|I consider Ice Station Zebra one of Rock Hudson's best performances.  This is a tense depiction of the Cold War years.  I love this movie and there's not one woman in it -- no nudity, romance, etc. to distract from the intrigue!
B002ZNJW0O|2.0|I have loved every sparks book I have read so far (till this one) I usually in some way feel I can relate to the characters. In this book none of the characters were likable, they were not even unlikable.. they were just flat, I could of cared less what happened to any of them.
0439023491|5.0|I have to be honest, when I started reading this book, and found out that Katniss and Peeta were going back to the Hunger Games, I groaned and thought, \\"not again.\\" I thought that it was a cop-out idea on the author's part. There were so many more interesting places to take this follow up novel, that it seemed like a waste and a let down to just repeat what happened in the first book.<br /><br />I WAS WRONG.<br /><br />Completely, dead wrong. Don't misunderstand me. Like most series, the second book is almost never as good as the first, and this case is no different. There is a soft spot in my heart for the first Hunger Games, but as a sequel, Catching Fire definitely delivers. Yes, Katniss and Peeta are back in the arena, and there are some definite similaries: Katniss has an amazing ability to remember important survivial methods learned from her father at just the right moment. Peeta again is the weakest link. But, beyond all that this is another amazing page-gripping story. This arena is much, much different.<br /><br />I found myself hating the Capital, hating Mr Snow, and really rooting for Katniss, Peeta and their friends.<br />I'm glad I stuck it out and read this book. Believe the hype, Catching fire was amazing!<br />I was floored by the twist at the end and am anxiously awaiting the third book.

0316044938|4.0|I had expected this book to be about the search for her murder. The story is in fact about her family dealing with her loss, there are times in the beginning of the book where it is a bit slow and boring. Watching how each family member deals with the loss in their own way was the most interesting part of the story.

0452295548|5.0|Why is a book about a brain scientist's experience of having a stroke gracing the pages of my religion blog?<br /><br />Because it was a religious experience. Jill's massive stroke caused the left half of her brain to shut down. The side responsible for linear, logical thinking. So what remains?<br /><br />It's not so much that the two hemispheres process different information; a person can survive with only half a brain. The difference is in the way the two sides think. To the right side, no time exists but the present moment, and each moment is vitally alive, the moment of now being timeless and abundant. Our right mind is the big-picture side, spontaneous and carefree, imaginative and artistic, uninhibited and empathic. We walk in the shoes of another and feel their feelings from the right side of our brain.<br /><br />By contrast, the left side of our brain is detail-oriented. It is organized and deductive, logical and analytical, able to divide past from present from future. Our left brain conquers the world we live in. Our left brain is also the part of us most responsible for identifying the I. It carefully draws the boundaries between us and the rest of the world, protects us from hurt, preserves our precious identity. It revels in our individuality and strives for our independence.<br /><br />So, what happens when you find all sense of I gone, and you're left swimming in a universal and eternal sea of brotherhood, suddenly at one with the universe? And, more important: Can we tap the right side of our brains?<br /><br />Drive fast to your bookstore and pick up this book. Go now.
B0025KVLUG|2.0|While the 2009 remasters are as close as we aged original Beatle fans will get to our beloved vinyls, I recall being disappointed with the muddiness of \\"Baby Your a Rich Man\\" (on the \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" LP), \\"All You Need is Love\\", \\"Only A Northern Song\\", \\"All Too Much\\" and a few other LP tracks way back in the 60's. While the 2009 remasters are great, the muddiness evident in these select tracks has carried over to the 2009 remasters. If you want to hear the lads singing in your living room instead of through a sock, may I suggest you pick up \\"Songtrack\\" instead of the remastered compilation offered here. All six of the lad's contributions appearing on this CD are remixed and enhanced with much greater clarity on the \\"Yellow Submarine Songtrack\\" CD, including many other remixed tracks from other albums whereby the vocal tracks have finally been properly centered (eg, Nowhere Man and Think For Yourself). Just listen to Baby Your A Rich man and Only A Northern Song on Songtrack and I doubt you'll ever go back.<br /><br />Compare for yourself. I know many pundits for authenticity don't like to mess with the original recordings but nothing is added or taken away from the lad's performances in \\"Songtrack\\". If anything, you can hear them better. As for George Martin's instrumentals, they're great in the context of the movie, but since they are mostly reactive to what's going on on the screen and we can't see the screen on an audio CD, it just doesn't stand alone as a listening experience here. It's like watching a Road Runner cartoon with a burned out projector lamp. Those opposed to remixing perhaps should take note; the same engineers and project coordinator who gave us the 2009 remasters (Allan Rouse, Paul Hicks and Steve Rooke) also gave us Songtrack. Evidently they too knew what needed to be done.

B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|I was riveted by this series. It was fantastic and the quality of every aspect about it made it quite cinematic. It never felt like a television show.<br /><br />Every zombie movie touches upon the difficulties of adjusting to life once society breaks down. However, in those zombie movies, they are only able to devote a few moments, out of the 90-120 minutes, to that enthralling subject.<br /><br />In this series they go through a painstaking detail about what it's like to lose your family, dealing with \\"dangerous\\" survivors, the logic of racism when there is no longer a real race left, sacrificing survivors for the betterment of the others, how to maintain a family and raise children in an apocolypse, figuring out the vulnerabilities and behavior of the zombies, and whether life is really even worth living in such a bleak world.<br /><br />The zombies are pretty much secondary since they just exist to create this stunning landscape to establish a top notch drama. This is as good as anything that could be out there. Even my wife, who would never willfully watch a \\"zombie\\" movie, was totally engrossed by this captivating drama.<br /><br />This is a \\"perfect ten\\" of a piece of entertainment!

You see a friend gave it to me and I took it more to be polite then out of true interest in the book. I was pleasantly surprised when I started reading the book.  I really got into it and loved that the story was from the dog's point of view.  If only he had thumbs and a voice he could have saved everyone in the story a lot of heartache.  I thoroughly enjoyed the book and would recommend it for cat & dog lovers alike.

It has worked well with my Phillips docking station.  Thankfully my Phillips has a adjustment for helping with stability.  One draw back has been an occasional error message that says not all features are enabled.

But for what I was looking for which was a way to dock my phone with the otterbox case not haveing to be removed it is great.

B002ZG99N6|5.0|This movie has a great storyline and is very realistic. It is not based on a true story, but it does take place in Charlestown which is known for armed robberies as a major issue there.<br /> Ben Afflecks character is a robber with a crew who work for a known criminal in charlestown. The FBI are trying to catch them,but have no proof. There is also some romance in it between Ben Afflecks character and a girl starred by Rebecca Hall. Great ACTION, Great DRAMA, Great ROMANCE- All together an excellent movie!her where she then tells him to come to her house. Knowing that the FBI is there he sadly says alright and tells her he loves and is getting ready to come knowing he will be arrested, but then unwilling to let that happen because of her feelings she still has for him she tips him off so he doesn't come. Ben leaves town, but leaves the money behind for rebecca and a clue as to where he went. They do not end up together when it ends, but Ben has plans of seeing her sooner or later!    Great ACTION, Great DRAMA, Great ROMANCE- All together an excellent movie!
B0026P40NU|5.0|Absolutely fascinating.  The story is riveting and the acting is superb.  You want to watch all six hours without stopping because you can't wait to see what happens next.

1594202842|2.0|I've rarely seen such a split between what's being hyped by the author as per WSJ and what's actually in the book itself.  Had this book been hyped solely on the basis of what it's actually about, I would argue that sales would be nowhere what they are.  A combination of overgeneralizations about cultural differences, self-indulgent stories, and a fair amount of filler and not much more.  We all worry about our kids, we all try to push them (by one means or another) and we all sooner or later figure out that kids pick up what they will and ignore what they will.  Nothing new there, and nothing much new in this book.

So many of the pages have little envelopes, packages, etc. that you can open, and they have things inside like a Maurauder's map or a Yule Ball ticket. Great for Potter fans, old and young! Very happy with my purchase. It is prominantly displayed in my bedroom!

0545123275|2.0|With all the buzz created around this book, and the fact that it was a refreshing breath of fresh air from vampires, I was excited.  Within the first couple chapters, I knew I was going to be disappointed.  The writing has horrendous.  While the plot seemed to have an interesting premise, werewolves that change because of the temperature, the way it was written negated what could have been an interesting plot, although not without faults either.  (IE:  It seemed a little too convenient that the parents were gone all of the time.) The book could have still been saved by the characters, but the characters were actually the worst part of this novel.  The story alternates between being told by the two main characters, Sam and Grace, which should offer different bits of insight, making the book more interesting.  In my opinion however, this was actually the weakest part of the entire book.  The chapter titles is the name of however is telling that chapter.  I had to keep referring back, because I could not tell who was saying what apart.  The characters' individual voices were not developed at all.  Finally, beyond that, the characters were just plain unlikeable.  They both seemed whiny and selfish, and hard to relate to, which made me care less and less about their plight.

B002G1YPH0|5.0|I purchased this cooler for my new build (Asus Crosshair IV Formula, AMD Phenom II X6 1090T, Antec Three Hundred case with back and top fans on low speed).  The CPU idles at 29 C.  No matter what I do, I can't get the processor above 40 C - even with HD video encoding!  If you're looking for an air-based cooler for a rig that does all but the most extreme overclocks, I'd give this a serious look.    I did knock off some stars for noise (it's not quiet enough for my wife, but it is for me!), installation (a bit difficult if you don't look around for how to do it - the instructions are not too clear), and dimensions (you're gonna need a BIG case for this one).    EDIT 1/25/11:  I went into my BIOS and changed the CPU fan profile...this definitely quieted my computer WAY down.  Still idles at 29 C, but temps are up to a sweltering 42 C while doing HD video encoding.  Fan speed was originally at 1950 rpm; now around 700 rpm at idle, up to 975 when under full load.  The two degree tradeoff for quiet operation is well worth it.
0375847227|4.0|I had just finished reading Chronicles of Narnia, and had just watched the Golden Compass on TV to realize that there was a series of these books.  Knowing that I would not see a 2nd or 3rd movie made in this series, I had to read the book.  It's quite good.  Interesting source of fantasy and thought that has not been explored in this fashion.  While I did find some holes towards the end of the Golden Compass book that left me wanting, I look forward to continued reading and finding those gaps filled by the next two books. Great book for teenagers and young adults (of all ages), but a little harsh for young children.

B000UFAURI|4.0|Hi, hope you all are having a good time here on Amazon. Recently picked up and listened to the latest Foo Fighters CD, Echoes, Silence, Patience and Grace, and it is one of their best.    This album is more mature than their earlier releases. Their is still a bit of angst, but this album shows the Foo Fighters writing has become more complex and more diverse. The world has changed a bit since the days when alternative/grunge were all the rage, and, accordingly, so have the Foo Fighters. This album opens with 'The Pretender', a song I don't really like, very much a typical modern rock song, almost indistinguishable from a lot of other bands. that said, this is followed by more energetic rockers, and well written ones, that break away from repetitive riffing and verse/chorus ztructure, well, enough to be interesting and, as usual for the Foo Fighters, are very melodic.     The second half of the album is devoted to various styles, from acoustic and folky songs to piano ballads such as 'Statues' and 'Home'. There is also the bluegrass instrumental 'Ballad of the Beaconsfield Miners', and it seems touching that one of America's biggest rock bands had the time to think about those guys. There is also some great rockers in there, such as the bluesy-rock 'Summer's End' and 'But Honestly', which begins as soft and acoustic but gradually builds up to a blistering rocker.     Dave's vocals are good throughout, plenty of emotion, and the band plays well. The songwriting is good and their is plenty of variety. Worth ****. Recommended.

B0031SU2Y2|5.0|Simply put, a wonderful indie film that shows doing what's right, gaining compassion, sometimes means breaking the law.  A heart wrenching end.
0440241901|2.0|Well, my first Chick Lit book was \\"The Undomestic Goddess,\\" (also by Kinsella) which I really enjoyed. So I was really looking forward to reading more of her work. As much as I had to suspend my disbelief for TUG, THIS one was almost impossible. I'd give it 2-1/2 stars if I could. I found myself skimming skimming skimming, and had a difficult time with all the, \\"And there was Jack\\" moments toward the end. Brother. I didn't hate it, but I kindof wish I could get those hours back so I could invest them in something else.
081297381X|4.0|I mostly enjoyed this work of philosophy and found Taleb a largely entertaining and witty writer (this is the only book of his I have read).  I'm glad I purchased the second edition as I think the new section - \\"On Robustness and Fragility\\" - included some of the most interesting observations. Particularly his comments regarding some of the criticisms that have been levelled at him (his reflection on the improbable prospect of a certain economist bursting into his bedroom in the middle of the night actually made me laugh out loud).    Despite these positives I feel that this is no more than a 4 star book (3.5 if that was an option) because it meandered so frustratingly at times.  This is obviously Talebs prerogative and he enjoys it.  And perhaps, had I been reading the book while lazing on a tropical beach somewhere, I would have enjoyed reading it as much as he appears to have enjoyed writing it.  Instead I felt myself itching with frustration and wanting to shout out \\"Get on with it\\" on more than one occasion.    That should not detract from what really is a very good book with some amazing insights. I think my expectations had been set by comparisons with the writing of people like Malcolm Gladwell and as a result I was expecting something altogether more \\"easy\\" and \\"popular\\".  Had I been forewarned to expect something a little more thorough I would have allowed more time and space to read the book.
B000FA5MUI|5.0|This book was pure comic genius using dark ironic humor. One of the greatest books ever. I love it so much all of you should read it!
0316044938|2.0|Once again, I fell for the hype.  I assumed this book would be excellent because of all of the attention surrounding it, the movie etc.  I thought that the book was going to be the story of a murdered girl who haunts her family through dreams to help them find her killer...and it was sort of, but not really.  The book mostly is just Susie watching her family from her \\"heaven\\" after she dies, which is actually really boring. I was very disappointed with the ending of this book & was expecting more suspense and drama with \\"Mr. Harvey\\" (the murderer).  Alice Sebold is a beautiful writer, but I wouldn't recommend this book.
0312600844|5.0|I read The Corrections years ago and thought it was okay and mostly over-hyped. Jonathan Frazen is an unappealing personality to me so I did not want to read this book and avoided it for a long time. Finally I gave in, downloaded it, and read it non-stop to the end. It was a really compelling read. The characters are very interesting, unique and well-developed. You can imagine knowing someone like the main characters, or they will remind you of someone's life that you know. Though I still don't like JF and wish he weren't getting the royalties, I have to recommend this book as an enjoyable read.
B0046B8GEQ|3.0|I'm reviewing two seperate things here: one, the movie, and two, the Amazon video on demand delivery of the movie.    The movie itself is pretty good.  Not a Pixar quality movie with great character development and so on, but a good renter.    The VOD:  I have a recent Panasonic Blu Ray player with integrated Amazon interaction.  It's hardwired to a router, and the router is wired to a cable modem.  Since everything is wired for HD, I spent the extra dollar and went with the HD Amazon movie.  Poor choice, as it turns out.  The picture was certainly watchable, but it had a fair amount of compression loss and pixilization - big square blotches in random spots of similar color and the like.  The actual definition was also not \\"high definition\\".  Had I seen the same thing on the standard definition movie, I don't think I would have thought much of it.  Stay away from the high definition.  It's more money for the same movie.
0823095223|5.0|This was a gift for my husband and it has been so handy and wonderful for information. He loves it and uses it all the time. Amazon was great at getting it sent to me asap and had it box up perfectly to make sure it was sent safe. All the way around a great gift and dealing with Amazon.
B001P9EQH8|3.0|It made a difference, but not what I had expected. I had to use the bass boost, and it helped make the sound acceptable, but this is not very powerful at all and I expected more. If you need a small boost, this is nice and tiny, but I need a larger unit for my large studio headphones. It probably works better on more efficient earbuds.
B003YNFYD8|5.0|I was given this as a Christmas gift.  It took me back to when life was a little simpler.  Of course my three sons don't have quite the reminiscence of that time: \\"That is so boring,\\" \\"They all sound alike\\", \\"Can we listen to something else?\\"  What do they know.  No one has moved the music scene since the Beatles.
1594202842|2.0|The book is very well written, however while the author claims that it is a memoir the subject is always the same - piano or violin drilling sessions, and confrontations with the children.  Characters are not very well developed beyond their stereotypical role assigned to them: mother - harsh and unfriendly, daughter 1 - somewhat compliant, daughter 2- confrontational.   I think there is more to this style of parenting than being strict with the children that was not explored in the book.  It is not really a memoir, in the sense that it offers deep reflections on certain situations, actions taken, or even actions not taken.  It is just a string of events on the same repetitive theme - strict parenting.

B001S86J0I|5.0|Well, I had to order another copy of \\"Galaxy Quest\\" since my original disk was \\"borrowed\\" by my best friend's husband after a discussion of its parallels to \\"Star Trek.\\" Actually, I always expect these types of movies to be more ridiculing the original, rather than a homage or clever satirical presentation.  The good news:  \\"Galaxy Quest\\" is really both.  As a trekker, TOS by the way, I got many of the inside jokes and scenarios.  Guy in his red (expendable crewman shirt) and Rickman, as Dr. Lazarus, to Tim Allen, the Commander:  \\"I see you managed to get your shirt off!\\"  Anyone familiar with Star Trek would recall that Kirk lost, tore, ripped, or otherwise mangled his uniform shirt in just about every episode.  I stand in agreement with other reviewers that this film bears repeated watching since the are so many sight gags, clever lines and dialogues, and great stars, Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver, Alan \\"Hans Gruber\\" Rickman, Tony Shaloub, who are not hesitant to take on quirky roles.  The film is masterful in its casting, its script, and creating the Thermians.  Live Long and Prosper...
B002ZG9774|5.0|Winner of the 2011 Golden Globe for Best Original Song for \\"You Haven't Seen The Last Of Me,\\" is a recognition that is just the tip of the iceberg.  This movie doesn't pretend to be about the story- it's about the glitter, the imagery, the sounds, and the one and only voice coming out of Grammy-award winning Christina Aguilera.    You would be a fool not to indulge in this high-energy musical.  It's all fun with great music to boot; its the first musical to win the Golden Globe for Best Original song since 1996!  Can't wait to see the special features!
B000QFW7UA|5.0|This has to be one of the finniest movies ever. It has some of the best characters a movie could have. The plot is simple, they find a treasure map in the attic and decide to go on a treasure hunt to save their homes from being torn down to make way for a new developement. I also want to say that this Blu Ray has a bunch of special features and even comes with a Goonies game. Definately worth while.
030746363X|2.0|The book has some useful information but the author spends too much time telling personal stories and reciting other people. If you are looking for entertainment you may enjoy his musings. I wanted a more instructional book and not so much superfluous writing to sift through
B0006419J6|4.0|\\"I, Robot is very well done science fiction entertainment.  The story is roughly based upon the great Isaac Asimov's robot stories, particularly \\"Robot Dreams\\" which was one of his last robot stories.  This one is set in the 2030s.  Robots are well-accepted components of society, and humans are growing increasingly dependent upon them.  \\"US Robots\\" is a huge and powerful company that manufactures the robots.<br /><br />US Robots is about to release a much more intelligent and powerful robot model.  Detective Del Spooner (Wil Smith, from Independence Day) has reason to doubt the safety of the new robots, and it turns out he has a point.  More would be telling.<br /><br />This one is faithful to Isaac Asimov's vision of robots integrated into human society, and the effects that this might have.  The special effects are terrific, and the robots are believable and realistic.  The story, while somewhat over the top, is nonetheless engaging and fast-paced.  Next, I would like to see a movie made of Asimov's Elijah Bailey series of novels, which is also part of the \\"Robot\\" series.  This movie proves that this would be practical.<br /><br />Recommended.  RJB.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|To you people who claim that what Dan Brown writes is evil, calm down. Dan Brown is not the first person to use conpiracy theories and alternative possibilities in history in his writing and he won't be the last. I am a devout Christian and I love his books. Do I agree with everything he uses in his plots? No. But I know he just uses them to create thrilling adventures for his characters, not to poison people's minds with heretical ideas. So people, please don't be so sensitive!
B000AGTPUK|4.0|We bought this DVD just in time for Christmas.  The first time, we watched this movie with our 4 and 6 year olds and then included the 2 year old the next day during a second viewing.  All 3 boys LOVED it and wanted to watch it multiple times over Christmas vacation.  There were a few \\"scary\\" and tense parts of the movie, but everything turns out ok, and the boys were not worried about those parts after seeing them one time.  Great movie for the family!  Wonderful animation!  Beautiful music!  A thrill for everyone!

It's about that time again.....to get sad,  as i don't have a new season to look forward to.....but there's plenty to relive.  Story:  I heard of a clerk at a video store warning a customer, saying, \\"You have to be careful with that one (24) - it's like a drug.\\" A friend recently 'discovered' it.  He and his mother spent much of their free time watching and watching.  They just HAS to see what came next.  It tooks weeks and weeks, but they made it from beginning to end - their '24' marathon. So beware - this show is SO good that you you will get 'hooked' on it.....in a very good way.

B0034G4P7Q|2.0|.....if your 40 and up. I mean, I'm in my mid 40s and I had a hell of a time with the quick banter. Remember the old 30s and 40s movies when the dialogue was unnaturally fast. This is pretty close. I was interested only in the historical aspect of the movie; who was this facebook founder? I suppose I found the answer but was bored to tears getting to it. Easily directed at the 18 to 30 age group, it left other generations behind. Of course the founders roots were in this generation but the film was too hyper smart. One too many longwinded lines.                       At the start of the movie I almost shut it off. I entered a laboringly dull conversation, and its reaching attempt for the viewer to be clued into a nuanced dilema of nerd vs. pretty girl. The film lacked any and all real humor. Think of all the great ways that the beginnings of Facebook could have been a laugh fest. The Zuckerberg charactor was for the most part unappealing. The zealous desire to reach realism overplayed itself. Too deep for its own good.                                The last seven to ten minutes were the best, and opened the key to what the film should have been. The conversation with the female law intern was natural and less contrived. Sending a friend request to his old girlfriend was great stuff. The camera pulling back, the notes to the Beatles' Rich Man slowly building. Then, a pondering look covers his face. This  gave the charactor of Zuckerberg charisma. That was the snapshot that endeared itself to what Facebook has become. Unfortunately, ten minutes of grandeur can't save a film.

B001QOGYBI|1.0|I have waited so long to get this from the library so I could enjoy a highly rated animation.  My husband was asleep in no time and I picked up a book to read after about 45 mins.  I did not like that the colors of the clothes and setting were all about the same shade.  I did not think the characters were interesting.  I kept waiting for a reason to care about a restless fox that wants to hunt chickens.  We gave up and shut it off.  I am so glad I did not buy this one.

0810979772|5.0|I know a 3rd grader who loves the Diary of a Wimpy Kid Book series. I wanted to surprise him with a new book but didn't know which books he'd read from the library. I looked online and found the Diary of a Wimpy Kid Do-It-Yourself Book. I really liked the book because not only did it encourage him to read but to also write! I ordered the book and gave it to his mother to give to him. The next time I saw him he thanked me for book, told me how cool it was, and said, \\"Now, I have my own Wimpy Kid Diary!\\"

0385340540|5.0|I am glad I did not let the negative reviews deter me from trying this one out. Now, I understand what exactly has led to so many negative reviews. Readers expect it to gather breakneck speed from no later than chapter 2! It is the artistic depiction of Italy's romantic and rich heritage, with attention to the details of food, architecture and history that must have made people wonder - why am I being made to read a travel guide instead of a high octane spy thriller? Well, Grisham has hidden the answer to that question extremely skilfully in the book itself. Fransesca's words about American tourists describe it all - they have a long list of things to see, and they are so ever ready to scratch this one off their list and move to the next one. They are so worried about tomorrow - where are they going? what is the itinerary? Instead of absorbing the vibes of the present, instead of living in the awe-inspiring history of this building for a moment, they are always so anxious to get a move on. The speed of this story languishes at times within the by-roads of Italian cities, but that has a purpose. It makes us see as Joel Backman is seeing it, and then it serves as the perfect ambush for the next twist in the gripping spy novel that it actually is. The perfect juxtaposition of day to day struggles of an alien trying to master Italian, and a high octane race for life makes this book so very enjoyable, in my opinion. The slow pickup speed does demand a certain degree of faith on John Grisham, and then that faith is repaid back with interest. The intricacies of political power mongering, keeping secrets, government approved killings, negotiating and espionage come beautifully to life in this story, and may I add that Grisham, for once, scores by sticking to the tried and true formula for success by giving us a happy ending. I still remember the frustration of reading \\"The Appeal\\" - I could not believe that Carl Trudeau had the last laugh! I felt cheated of my entire night!But with this story, no such anomalies, you get what you want.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|We love the extended collector's edition of Avatar.

Kris Carr has created a witty, funny, heartwarming, and informative book. I'm so thankful to have all of the wisdom she has complied over the years in one book. So many get-healthy books are stuffy reads, but this one is incredibly entertaining! A must-have!
B004CLYKLI|5.0|I read all of Chua's books after seeing the controversial WSJ excerpt \\"Why Chinese Mothers Are Superior.\\" I think one of her main ideas is stated in that piece: western parents view love as accepting and supporting their children for whoever they are and whatever they want to be, whereas Chinese parents view love as pushing their children to be the best that they can be and refusing to give up on them no matter what. Chua had put it more bluntly, something like: white people think love means telling their kid it's ok to be a loser; Chinese parents think love means telling their kids they're not losers, or at least have the ability to rise out of loser-dom if they work hard.<br />Chua's voice is hilarious, intelligent, human, aggressive, and insanely blunt. This combination makes her offensive to many people but the way she mocks herself endears her to me. She's self aware enough to know that she can be wrong and that she can be overly obsessive. I liked the book mainly because it was an entertaining, touching, well written memoir. It also contains insights into Asian culture and values, and into human nature in general. I don't think it's intended to be instructional or preachy- she's not trying to use her memoir as an \\"Autobiography of Malcolm X\\"-like call to action.  Although I do think Chua thinks she's right about almost everything and her daughters are amazing, I don't think she thinks everyone else should strive to be like her, nor do I think her \\"we must be the best / we are the best\\" attitude is the message of the book- it's just her personality. The sheer amount of time and energy she put into the upbringing of her kids and into every project she approaches is staggering (even for an Asian person!), and I think she acknowledges that she's atypically obsessive and anal, for example when she relates funny anecdotes about how she tried applying her Chinese parenting methods to her fluffy, clueless dog.<br /><br />As a memoir, Chua's book is great. Because of her writing, she makes me interested in her life even though she's not an important historical figure or anything. Her use of language really pushes the humor into the LOL zone for me (for instance she describes the discovery that her dog ranks low in intelligence as \\"nauseating\\"). In addition, I relate to a lot of what she's saying as a Chinese person. For example she proudly asserts for the record that she is the only Asian her husband has ever dated, and she has funny anecdotes about how first generation asians are so frugal they worry about using too much dish detergent. I think her bluntness will offend a lot of people because they take it to mean she is cruel or rude- she'll use words like \\"fatty,\\" \\"lazy,\\" and \\"loser,\\" words that white people do not use casually in the presence of their children. In contrast many Asians are very ready to use those words and it isn't meant to just insult for the sake of hurting someone's feelings. It's a cultural difference that Chinese people are less tactful and more blunt in their language, particularly when they are talking to family.<br /><br />The book describes some Asian ideas that dominate how Chinese people approach life and raise their children. I am Chinese, I went to MIT, and I was/am an over-achiever in many ways. However I was not raised in the way Chua described- my parents had no time to harass me to do anything (I was a latchkey child and they never even saw any of my report cards or knew which colleges I'd applied to till after I got in), so I was driven not due to force but simply because I absorbed my parents' values into my psyche. The Chinese philosophy is this:<br />1) The future is everything. The present is about suffering so that the glorious future will one day be achieved, and the past is to be repressed except when you want to compare its horrors to the awesomeness that will be the future.<br />2) Chinese people accept sacrifice and suffering as everyday experiences. Childhood is not idyllic- it's about preparing, suffering within the confines of institutional learning so that they're well positioned when the real world hits. Chinese people would never underestimate their children's ability to suffer or work because many Chinese people suffered atrocities throughout their lives. My dad's whole family starved to death during the cultural revolution and I'd often wake in the night to find him eating all the leftovers in the fridge, so I would never allow myself to be waylaid by some stupid exam. An idea that is implicit here is that achievement is related to hard work/practice. This sounds like an obvious idea but I think it is made more explicit in Chinese culture than in other cultures- while most people will view something like tennis as a skill obviously related to practice, many people might not make that association as readily with something like math ability.<br />3) Chinese parents view children's judgment as vastly inferior to their own judgment. Up to a point this is valid, because children's brains are growing and for at least a decade they are not capable of making decisions that are rational or long term optimal. But Chinese parents sometimes take this to an extreme and will ignore a kid's decisions even when the kid's brain is well developed. This idea may seem to contrast with the high expectations parents have for kids but it really just means that the kids are supposed to perform towards the goals the adults have decided. Any parent of those prodigy kids who are professional golfers/tennis players by age 13 have already figured out that kids will put in a lot of work and energy into a goal that has been decided by the parent. The big problem with this view is that the kids eventually need to have good judgment of their own, to have the confidence to pursue their own goals. Furthermore it's human nature to be unhappy if you feel you have no control. Unless the kid also incorporates the idea of long term happiness as a goal, the kid is just doing the work to please the parent and this is not healthy or sustainable.<br /><br />I'd recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a hilarious, smart, moving account of a Chinese American mother's life and learn something about Chinese culture. If you were offended by the WSJ piece, I'd recommend taking a look at the end of this book. I'd been very curious what her daughters thought of her piece and it turns out her family helped her edit every page. Their reactions were very funny and real, too. And, amazingly, both daughters tell her they were glad she forced them to practice their instruments 6 hours a day. But they're still &lt;18 years old- they still have time to start hating her more in the future, a fact of which she seems well aware.  The story is still happening, so the writing at the end is not as tight as the beginning but she comes to some conclusions that are very different from what the sensationalist WSJ piece might imply.ng within the confines of institutional learning so that they're well positioned when the real world hits.

B000EWBNMS|5.0|The series Medium is one of the best that television production has ever offered. Almost every one of the shows in intricate to make a full length movie, and if they had done so, they would be better than most of the full length movies out there. The writing and production is excellent. One can never know what's going to happen next, defying all predictable formulas.<br /><br />Do you like police/crime shows? Do you like eerie shows about the paranormal? Do you like heart warming family shows? Somehow, the writers and producers manage to artfully blend all three genres together in the series Medium. Most incredibly, the series is based on a real-life Allison Dubois, who not only serves as a consultant to the series, but is also featured in interviews at the very end of the last disc in this package. That is something the casual fan would not get on TV. Also, as in regular DVD movies, there is included deleted scenes and a commentary track for the die-hard fan.<br /><br />I would recommend this package to anyone.
B00498YZH8|5.0|I've seen many \\"backwoods\\" films but this one is by far the most real depiction of life as it is. Without a tinge of anything Hollywood phony, preconceptions of known actors in previous roles, or flashy promotion, this film should be nominated for the year's best. Ms. Lawrence does a superb job of playing a simple teen caught in a web of complex adult treachery, revealed perfectly as the movie unfolds. The background settings an scenery is 100% untouched - natural reality at it's best. This film is not as dark and foreboding as many have described it, rather presents the opportunity to see many good things about one's self, family, and other people as well as lending a current of appreciation for what many of us have and take for granted, given their lives. A powerful raw platter of human emotion served up, done right, and a poignant illustration of HOW it's done right.
0061914177|5.0|OK so I just finished this book and came here to write my review. In the process, I started reading some of the reviews and controversy about this book. So let me say this for those people actually looking for an intelligent review of this book.<br /><br />The negative reviews of this book almost all centered around 3 things: The reviewer expecting a 50 great tips/How to book, their disagreement with the concepts of online business as a main way of doing business, and their own excuses of why it won't work.<br /><br />I have to address these to help you get an accurate review of this book. First this is a concept book not a how to. Most negative reviews said there was no substance. They must have been thinking it was going to be full of the \\"how to tips\\" and were disappointed when they didn't get that. This is more like a Rich Dad, Poor Dad book that changes the way you think of making money and spending your time. If you like Four Hour Workweek by Timothy Ferriss, you will like this.<br /><br />2. They don't think it will work. They are traditional thinkers that you should work a job you don't like until you die. This book helps you find a passion and build a business around it that will also grow with the growth of the internet. This is a paradigm shifting book for those ready to think differently. You will have to find your own details of how to use the concepts but Gary shows you how he put them into use.<br /><br />3. They attack Gary saying he had this advantage or the principles don't apply to everyone. Gary gives his examples so you can see how it can work, but he tells you that you have to make the principles work for your passion and business model. He gives great resources, but they are the ones he has found. They may not be the exact ones you will use.<br /><br />Conclusion of the negative reviews: First this is a concept book not a \\"how to copy Gary\\" book. This book is great for people who are looking for fresh ideas on how to change the way they think of work, the internet, and social groups. If you have had thoughts about getting involved with an online business part time or full time, this is a great book.<br /><br />Now for my thoughts. I love Gary's passion. His story from youth shows how he thought differently about social groups, and efficiency. When the internet came along he saw it for the powerful tool that combines both of those worlds. He shows you in a rough model how he applied principles to grow online businesses and make money. This book will ignite your mind to the possibilities of online business. You can alter your current business to catch the wave of internet marketing or start fresh with a passion of yours that has been on the shelf. It may just lead to full time income and beyond. Great Book Gary! I gave this book 9 out of 10 stars on my own scale and highly recommend it. It is in my top 20 books. I don't need the author to tell me how exactly to apply it, I get the great concepts and then apply them. You will have to plug your own brain in after reading this. I read books at a feverish pace and review them. I suggest this book as a companion to the Four Hour Workweek by Timothy Ferriss.ps.

0525951652|4.0|I would definitely recommend this book, especially as a holiday read. It is easy to read, it's interesting, it is informative and it is entertaining. It is not, however, the kind of book that you will remember for the rest of your life and will dream about it, as you might, for instance War and Peace. And the reason for that is that the characters are not so profoundly developed and the plot is rather weak. However, it is easy to understand why it is so. I believe Mr. Follet tried to adapt the characters (and the plot) to the events in history, so that he could describe the most important events leading up to or during WWI with characters who could be placed in the middle of them. I believe he compromised the plot and characters in order to narrate the events of history he thought were important to reach his conclusions and analysis. For that reason, the characters aren't as believeble as you would like and the stand alone plot is common place, very \\"soap opera\\" like. But if you are not worried about that and are interested in reading about the political backstages of WWI, the social unrest, the every day life of a Europe in war, refreshing your memory about interesting historical facts (i.e. the political discussions leading up to the war, the arrival of Lenin in Russia to lead the revolution; the League of Nations, the Versaille Treaty etc), from a perspective of the people at the time, the emotions they must have felt during the course of these events, it is definitely a good and interesting read. I am not a historian, but from a layperson's point of view, the research is superb and the most important facts are there. The analysis and overview of the facts and events are also very intelligently done, very objective and unbiased. You are not left empty at the end of this book, as you are with many holiday reads. Quite the contrary, you are left thinking about history, politics and human nature. If you're interested in that, don't even think twice and buy this book.
0201633612|5.0|A design pattern is a verified and correct solution to a well known problem or situation.<br /><br />This book should be mandatory for all software engineer students. Design patterns are, at least in Spain, sadly not very common, and of those times that are actually used, a few are incorrectly used (for having read about them in a small tutorial but not properly understood the specific pattern).<br /><br />The patterns explained are divided in three groups:<br /><br />Creational: As the name implies, groups patterns related to object construction and instancing.<br />Structural: How to structure, organize, architecture, join and access objects.<br />Behavioral: The more varied one. From ways of communication between objects, to command systems, hiearchies, state management...<br />The nice thing of design patterns is that not only they provide you solutions to problems you might encounter in the future, usually you find solutions to problems you've had too (and how knows, maybe you used the same approach without knowing it was a design pattern!).<br /><br />Some of this design patterns are so useful you'll end up using them very frecuently, like the Factory, Singleton, probably a Facade, and Iterator (, just to mention a few) are already present in a lot of languages in core modules/components.<br /><br />While the examples of the book are in C and Java, the patterns explained are so important that we have ports of them to other languages like .NET. There are even books that talk about them again (along with other newer patterns) in languages like PHP.<br /><br />As I mentioned, a must-read to avoid reinventing the wheel and losing precious time.
B002VZC9CY|5.0|This two CD package, plus the fabulous booklet that goes along with them, make for a fine listening and reading experience. Each song has its own clever personality, as did the children's poems or writings she worked from. I liked reading the history of each song and appreciated the wide group of authors and countries represented. Loved the orchestral accompaniments!
0446677450|4.0|I bought this book on the recommendation of a friend at work.  The books premise, that we need to accumulate assets and avoid accumulating liabilities sounds a bit obvious at first, but if the idea is so simple why do so many of us do the opposite.  The book goes into why we do this and how some of us can choose to avoid the pitfalls of debt.  It does so through Kiyosaki telling us of childhood conversations he had with his \\"Rich Dad\\" and contrasting them with conversations with his \\"Poor Dad\\" or \\"Educated Dad\\".  No one can argue with the points he drives home, like we all need to be financially intelligent, above and beyond our academic and professional intelligence.  Another great point he drives home is how emotional decisions drive us towards debt instead of financial independence.  I LOVED THIS BOOK.  Maybe I'm just a simpleton who needed it spelled out for me, but it has made me start getting my act together and making plans for the future.  I am so grateful to Robert Kiyosaki for sharing his knowledge with me through this book.  THANK YOU Robert Kiyosaki.<br /><br />4 out of 5 stars for helping me pay more attention to my own financial decisions.

0393061310|5.0|I am a social studies teacher and haven't referenced any book more than this book in the 4 different subject areas that I teach.  It is a comprehensive study of the social progression of humanity.  It ultimately explains (not justifies) why certain ethnic and social group have become more powerful in recent and modern history.  I learned more from this book about people and why the world works the way it does than I did in the entirety my Social Studies Education undergrad program.

1599218011|5.0|I loved this book and I love Kris Carr.  She comes across as warm, inviting, hiliarious, intelligent, and caring.  Reading the book was like talking to a well-informed and passionate best girlfriend.  Kris recruited a large number of very reputable experts in the field of nutrition, wellness, medicine, etc.  I loved the format of the book, the beautiful pictures, and Kris's honesty.  Following Kris's recommendations, I've already lost 13 lbs, my skin is glowing, I feel much lighter, and my daily headaches are gone.  I've been able to break a 20 year diet soda/caffeine addiction, and I actually look forward to/crave a large green salad and avocados.  PLEASE do yourself and the world a favor and buy this book.  It could definitely add years to your life, if not save you from an early, unneccesary death.  My mother is a breast cancer survivor and I live in fear everyday of contracting the disease myself.  But, I know by following Kris's advice, I'm doing the most pro-active things that are in my control to stop this from happening.  Thank you Kris for this wonderful gift.

B000C20VPA|5.0|Just some thoughts...<br /><br />Throughout the years, while discussing Las Vegas with people who are knowledgeable about Las Vegas, I usually ask them this question:  \\"Which Las Vegas do you like better - the massive family-friendly Vegas of today with huge hotels, or the Vegas of the '70s when it was smaller, was more for adults, and run by the Mob?\\"  The answers I get are mixed.  When they ask me which Vegas I like better, my answer is the Vegas of the '70s when it was smaller.  Their next comment is usually, \\"Huh?  You're too young to know the Vegas of the '70s.\\"  My answer is, \\"No I'm not.  I was there a few times in the mid to late '70s and I remember it very well.  The city was 1/3 the size it is now, the hotels were smaller, people dressed up when going to the casinos, and it was more for adults than it is now.\\"  Even though I was a little kid the first time I visited Las Vegas, I remember these things very well.  There wasn't a whole lot for me to do there as a kid, except maybe go swimming in the hotel pool and go to Circus Circus.  But I remember being fascinated with the city.  The 100+ degree heat in August.  The Strip.  Fremont Street.  All the lights.  The nightlife.  Seeing people standing on the street corner dressed in glitzy outfits waiting to cross the street.  The casinos.  The slot machines.  The card games.  The live entertainment.  I of course wasn't allowed in casinos for extended periods of time, but I walked through a lot of them and liked what I saw.  The next time I visited Vegas was in August 1984.  It was basically the same city, but a little bigger.  Then the next time I visited Vegas was Labor Day Weekend 1995.<br /><br />What, I mean WHAT happened?  The city was now humongous, probably three times the size as it was in the mid '70s.  Giant hotels with 5,000 rooms.  Massive casinos.  Hardly anybody was dressed up.  It seemed like a family-friendly city instead of mostly for adults.  The new giant hotels dwarfed the older ones.  The Sands, Dunes, Sahara, Stardust, Aladdin, Frontier, Circus Circus, Riviera, Caesar's Palace, Hacienda...seemed so small now.  One year I got into a conversation with a limo driver and he told me that entertainers who performed in Vegas back in the '60s and '70s took a lot of pride in their performances.  He used B.B. King as an example.  He said that B.B. King would practice for hours before the show because he wanted to give a great performance and stay sharp.  He said that nowadays, an entertainer just gets out of a limo and goes right on stage.  Who knows if they even practiced.<br /><br />Now about this movie...<br /><br />I had never seen Casino (1995) until tonight.  I was hooked on this three-hour movie from the moment it started because right at the beginning there is a voiceover by Robert De Niro where he says (referring to the Vegas of today), \\"The town will never be the same.  Today it looks like Disneyland.\\"  He goes on to say, \\"In the old days, dealers knew your name, what you drank, and what you played.  Now, it's like checking in at the airport.  And if you want room service, you're lucky if you get it by Thursday.\\"  He also says that after the Mob was rooted out, big corporations took over, mommy and daddy play the poker slots, and the old casinos are being torn down.  Hearing all this really drew me into the movie because this is EXACTLY how I personally think when it comes to Vegas, as I described earlier.<br /><br />This movie stars Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and Sharon Stone.  Basically, without going into a lot of specifics, the movie shows Vegas in the days when it was run by the Mob.  It shows the dark side of Vegas - Mafia crime, drugs, alcohol, the consequences of cheating while gambling, brutality, murders, greed, how every crook is looking out for each other, and the lengths that Mob bosses will go to in order to gain more and retain what they have.  The period of time this movie covers is 1973-1980.  Ultimately, the movie shows how the Mobmade some bad mistakes that resulted in the Feds getting the Mob out of Vegas and how corporations took over and made it family-friendly.<br /><br />The acting in this movie is superb.  I thought Joe Pesci's acting was especially good.  Sharon Stone and Robert De Niro were excellent in their roles.  The movie has tons of filthy language.  This really adds a sense of realism.  It also has quite a bit of violence and blood and gore.<br /><br />I noticed that the up-close shots of the casinos were done in a way so the viewer would have a hard time telling what casino was being shown and/or what casino was next door.  This movie takes place in the '70s but was made in 1995, so the goal was to hide some of the newer hotel/casinos that were around in 1995 but weren't around in the '70s, such as The Mirage, Treasure Island, MGM Grand, Luxor, Excalibur, etc.  In the far-away shots, older hotel/casinos that existed in the '70s that were still around in 1995 (the year this movie was made) were shown, such as Stardust, Frontier, Circus Circus, Sahara, Dunes, Riviera, The Sands, etc.  The filming of downtown Vegas wasn't a problem, as just about all the hotel/casinos that existed in 1995 also existed in the '70s, such as The Golden Nugget, The Horseshoe, The Plaza, Four Queens, etc.<br /><br />This DVD's extras are very good.  It has a digitally remastered picture, a feature called Casino: The Story which talks about the script and the book the movie is based on, deleted scenes, and some moments with director Martin Scorsese, Sharon Stone, screenwriter Nicholas Pileggi, and more.<br /><br />I like Las Vegas, even the family-friendly Vegas of today.  I wish it was still the size it was in the '70s, but generally speaking, it's still one of the best vacation destinations in the world, and one of my favorite places.  Though it's violent and somewhat disturbing, this movie will provide a nostalgic look back to the smaller, adult-themed Vegas of yesteryear.  I highly recommend this movie.in the Feds getting the Mob out of Vegas and how corporations took over and made it family-friendly.    The acting in this movie is superb.

Einaudi, though, is a delightful surprise in this category for anyone outside of Europe who hasn't heard of him.
0679731725|5.0|A poignant, melancholy remembrance of a bygone period.  Part travelogue, mostly fictional memoir -- Remains of the Day illustrates in bittersweet brushstrokes the passing of an era and one man's inability to accept the decline of the British aristocracy after the second World War and his own lack of purpose in the new post-war (American-ascendant) world.  Through the first person narration of the classic butler Mr. Stevens, Ishiguro gradually reveals the extent of the protagonist's denial of his emotions and his betrayal at the hands of the person he trusted the most.  He sketches beautifully a relic who, nearing the evening of his life, can't bring himself to let go of both his past and the old society order to simply partake in the serenity and hospitality of the British countryside that surrounds him.  Wonderful prose and thoughtful commentary on the closure of the time when the world's great events were conceived and negotiated in the smoking rooms of British manors.

1439152780|5.0|From page one I knew that I would love this book, and upon finishing it (at 1:30 in the morning, while I was sick, after reading it for three nights) I promptly went out and bought all of Morton's other books.    The story begins when Edie Burchill's mother, Meredith, who has always been emotionally inaccessible to Edie, receives a letter in 1992 that had been buried in a closet since 1941, that reduces her to tears. Edie is shocked by her mother's reaction and wonders what it is from her mother's past that has cast such a long and enduring shadow over her life.    It's not long after that Edie finds Milderhurst Castle, the ancient castle that has cast the shadow.  It is the former residence of Raymond Blythe, the famed, reclusive author of Edie's favorite childhood tale, The True History of the Mud Man, and current residence of his strange, elderly spinster daughters: twins, Persephone and Seraphina, and their younger half-sister, Juniper.    When Edie is commissioned to write a new introduction to the old book, she's given access to the castle, the sisters, and the secrets of their past.  What she finds out about her mother, the Blythe family, and the terrible, stormy night that started Juniper's descent into madness so many years ago changes all of their lives forever.    With its layered story lines, book and letter excerpts, multiple time periods, spooky castles, and unusual characters, The Distant Hours is the perfect Gothic novel.  I enjoyed trying to piece together the mysteries, and devoured the book in just four days.  If you love books like Jane Eyre, Wuthering Heights, Rebecca, or The Thirteenth Tale you'll love The Distant Hours. I give it my highest recommendation.

0571240151|4.0|[Comments refer to the stage play \\"War Horse\\" by Nick Stafford, which is based on the novel of the same name by Michael Morpurgo]<br /><br />\\"War Horse\\" is pure story-telling, a classic tale for children but, hey, it's going to cause any adult to choke up with emotion. Think \\"Old Yeller,\\" by Fred Gipson, or Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings' \\"The Yearling.\\"<br /><br />The stage play by Nick Stafford tells the story of Joey, a horse -- half thoroughbred, half hunter -- born shortly before the outbreak of WWI, separated from his mother while still a foal, raised in the Devon countryside in England by young Albert Narracott and sold to the English cavalry to fight alongside the doughboys in France.<br /><br />Saying good-bye to his beloved horse, Albert vows: \\"I want you to do yourself proud. You go and drive those Germans back home, and then you come home. I promise you, Joey, that we shall be together again . . . I, Albert Narracott, do solemnly swear that we shall be together again.\\"<br /><br />Although too young to enlist, Albert, 16, lies about his age and sets out to find Joey and bring the horse home to the fields of Devon.<br /><br />A caveat: This paperback by Nick Stafford is the stage adaptation of the novel of the same name by Michael Morpurgo. The National Theatre in London gave the play its premier in 2007. The same production, in association with the Handspring Puppet Company, is scheduled to open at Lincoln Center in New York in the spring of 2011. Steven Spielberg is directing a movie of the book which is scheduled to premier December 2011.<br /><br />With that caveat in mind, for me the question then becomes does it make sense to read the play before seeing the \\"War Horse\\" stage production or before sitting down in a dark movie theater with a box of popcorn and watching the action unfold on the big screen.<br /><br />By reading the play beforehand, you'll know the story and how it ends. But it's a fantastically compelling story that has traction enough to be retold and retold without diminishing its emotional wallop.<br /><br />The value of reading the play before seeing the production is that you create Joey and his world in your imagination. Seeing what you've conjured in your mind's eye and how that compares to what happens on stage or in the movie theater is, for me at least, a pleasure all in its own right. Think of reading \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and then seeing the trilogy on screen. Reading \\"Gone With the Wind\\" before watching the classic movie.<br /><br />For me, reading the play or book first; seeing the movie after, enriches the entire experience. My advice, get to know Joey and his story as soon as you can; then make plans to see the play and go to the movie.<br /><br />[4.5 stars]op.

B004EC5IUW|5.0|I fell in love with the original Evangelion series and as a result i was skeptical of the rebuild movies, and i was right to be. For after viewing this amazing retake on the series I wanted nothing more than to drop my current life, learn japanese and go to Japan for the release of the next movie due to impatience. I found the movie to be just as gripping as it's predecessor and the animation to be even more so. A movie that I believe even non-fans will enjoy.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|Despite being a fan of \\"The X-Files\\", I completely blew off this series when it premiered.  I assumed that it was silly teenager entertainment with handsome, but vapid leads, and I most certainly was not in the target demographic.  Then when it moved from the WB to the CW, I congratulated myself on my good judgment and ignored the subsequent seasons.    Then a bunch of my internet buddies, some of whom were also X-Files fans, started praising the show and urging me to try it, and I just shook my head.  \\"Not my thing\\", I said.  But the recommendations continued through Seasons 2 and 3, and then suddenly, my LJ flist went into raptures over the introduction of a new character in the 4th season.  \\"Hmmmm\\", I thought.  \\"I suppose I could give the first season a try.\\"    So I bought the first season on DVD, and it sat in my To Be Viewed pile for months.  Then, one boring winter Saturday, I popped the first disc in the DVD play and watched the first season straight through.  \\"Well, hell\\", I thought. \\"This is *exactly* my kind of thing.\\"  And I proceeded to, within two months, watch the next three seasons on DVD.      It's a great little show.  Clever, scary, full of archetypes and folklore and interesting twists on classic urban legends.  The leads, Jared and Jensen, are darling, and the dynamic between the brothers is charming and funny and totally believable.  Both actors develop and hone their acting chops over the subsequent seasons, but Jensen, in particular, becomes a particularly compelling performer to watch.  He reminds me a lot of Ben Browder.  I am convenced that, had he not been on a Sci Fi Network genre television show, Ben would have been nominated and possibly won an Emmy for his work in the second and third seasons of \\"Farscape\\".      I feel the same way about Jensen's work in Season 2 of SPN.  But I'm getting ahead of myself.    This first season of SPN has the usual fits and starts of a premiere season, but the seeds of so much of what unfolds in later seasons are sowed in these first episodes that I can almost guarantee that after you make your way through the remaining seasons on DVD--and you will--it won't be long before you pop the first season DVDs into the player, just so you can go back and retrace the origins of the later arcs.    Highly recommended.

I bought this book, read about half of it, and then threw it away.  Here's why:    1) The author uses the word \\"goddamn.\\"   I don't knowingly pay for books or movies that demean the holy Name of my God.  2) The author's ambition is worldly, not Godly.  I am reminded of Solomon's warning in Ecclesiastes:  \\"All is vanity.\\"    Chua's language is engaging, and her anecdotes are clever and fun.  However, her thinking is twisted in many subtle ways.  I don't want to open my heart and my mind to her distorted ideas.

0811870413|5.0|I've read all of the reviews of this book and though I'm not a super experienced baker. I was able to do a reasonable job on my first pass. You have to be patient, but if you follow along you'll make it work.<br /><br />I've been a customer of Tartine the bakery for years... my wife and I generally reserve loaves of bread a couple of days ahead when we are having a dinner party, and a number of friends insist we bring a loaf or two when we come to visit - all affectionately call it \\"crack bread\\" cause you can't just have one piece.<br /><br />Anyway, when I saw the book come out I had to get a copy and give it a shot.<br /><br />The first thing you'll notice when you read the book is that it is a narrative. When you immerse yourself into the words and the tips, it really helps. I have limited experience baking bread, but by reading and re-reading the chapters about making a starter, the leaven, etc. I was able to follow along.<br /><br />If you are rushed, or want to rush through the process, then don't attempt the recipe. You have to be patient. I also recommend that you read and reread the sections. I did and it made me very comfortable during the baking process.<br /><br />I also recommend you purchase the Lodge cast iron combo cooker (available here on Amazon)[[ASIN:B0009JKG9M Lodge LCC3 Logic Pre-Seasoned Combo Cooker]]. If you are going spend the time to make the bread, then a 34.99 investment to replicate the most perfect crust in the world is well worth your time.<br /><br />The bottom line is you don't have to be an experienced baker. You just have to be methodical, patient, and take your time. The results are well worth the effort.
B000006SGT|5.0|I was a big fan in the 60s.  These are my favorite Animals recordings.  Their albums had many cuts at least equal to the hits in quality.  I've never seen the US albums released on cd.  Previous to this collection all I could find of the Alan Price period were single-disc greatest hits collections which missed so much.  Sound quality is excellent to my ears.    That leaves the American albums Animalization and Animalism to be found.  After that it became Eric Burdon and the Animals, who also had some decent stuff.  If you work at it you can find all the Animalism/Animalization material on a couple cds, which I have done.  I like that stuff too but the sound changed a lot.  Hilton fuzzed up his guitar, Alan is gone and replaced, still a lot of great stuff from that band and worth going deeper than the greatest hits collections of that period.    Espeically with the nutso low price for these discs, this is the way to go, I think.
1439181780|5.0|The Power by Rhonda Bryne is by far the best teaching of the law of attraction by far.  I've listened too and read dozens of material on the secret law of attraction.  nothing comes close to this.  it is an absolute must have.  it will forever change you in a positive way.
0316069906|2.0|I agree with that but why did he have to go on and on about his grandmother? I skipped many paragraphs because of this. I like the facts and only the facts, he went on and on about things that didn't seem relevant. If I would have read the highlights of the book I would have been satisfied but I feel I've lost a week of my life reading this book.  Yes I will make wise food choices but that's about it.
B00110K62U|5.0|EXCELLENT! I had viewed it several times on PBS and just had to have it. I only wish it provided a libretto so I could sing along.
B000ATQYT2|2.0|The movie was the same as the original, however it was cut to edit out a lot of the musicals that really make the movie. Very Disappointing...
B002ZG97EC|5.0|This movie will have you laughing the whole time. The three little girls steal the show. I could watch over and over again.
B002ZG99A4|5.0|The first time I heard about this movie I literally felt the hair on my testicles grow in length and girth. When I went to the theaters opening night I made sure that I not only get my ticket ahead of time, but I bought out the entire theater for my self so I can watch in the nude to completely absorb this films greatest.       At the conclusion of the film I knew that I had witnessed something more beautiful than Da Vinci's Mona Lisa combined with the second coming of Christ. I knew from that day that I needed to purchase the film for myself.      Between the time the film was released in theaters and its release on DVD I swear I slept with probably half the women of Montgomery county. Before watching this film finding any woman to sleep with me outside of the Wal-mart parking lot was an impossibility. I only have this work of art to thank for my new found sex appeal.     At the time the film came out in home digital form I spent the night in front of best buy just to be the first person to get it. I bought one copy of the film on Blu Ray (for obvious reasons). and proceeded too empty the inventory of the dvd copies. These DVD's are essential for me to bathe (literally) daily in this film's excellence.
B001M5UDGS|4.0|Almost three years ago, brothers Zack and Joss Whedon decided to make a musical web series during the writers' strike. What they produced was this phenomenal cult sensation in which Neil Patrick Harris plays a good-hearted bad guy who desperately wants to become a super villain in order to get his crush's attention. His efforts are thwarted when Captain Hammer makes an appearance.    What I found most brilliant is that this grassroots web series it superior in almost every way to hundreds of fully funded network shows. The songs are too catchy for the viewer's own good, the singing is great, and the acting is nearly flawless. Additionally, the Whedon's have perfected the formula for tragicomedies.    It is also astounding that in less than 6 months the web series made back its costs of production. Now that the whole series is on DVD, it is certain to make an even bigger bang! The DVD even has a musical commentary (the songs from the original series and the commentary are available on iTunes). So if you're behind the times, like me, pick up this DVD because you have no idea what you're missing.
B002ZCY7SW|5.0|As a 24 fan I enjoyed every minute of the 8 seasons. Let's hope Jack and the gang are coming back with a movie
B00005JKTF|4.0|Charlotte Gray (Cate Blanchett) is a young Scottish woman who falls in love with a British pilot in WWII, and volunteers to work undercover in Vichy France when she learns he was shot down there.  She doesn't tell anyone her true motivation, however, putting others in the underground at deadly risk as she tries to get more information about him.<br /><br />There are times she is called on to be strong and brave.  The training she received prior to leaving on her first mission makes this part believable.  However, the director chose to allow all the actors (except the Germans) to speak in their normal accents... Scottish, English, French, and American.  This was noticeably jarring at times, because you'd be thinking, \\"Gee, the German soldiers or Vichy police should recognize THAT accent as a foreigner!\\"  Instead, they'd say good day and go on with their business.<br /><br />The general plot and the ending was a bit predictable.  Brave woman makes mistakes, takes a deep breath of reflection, then charges ahead.<br /><br />But I enjoyed the film, nevertheless.
B001P9EQH8|5.0|Have had the amp for about 2 weeks because I needed a volume controller for the headphone jack I made for my TV and it works great! I haven't had any problems with it and it keeps a charge for a good amoun of time. The only downfall is the lower quality male/male cords that come with it. They're cheap enough though so it's not a big deal.
B001GCUO5M|3.0|When does society place you when you've committed a terrible crime, are still violent, and suffer from mental instability as well?<br /><br />Shutter Island, an old Civil War prison.<br /><br />Federal Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) is sent to Shutter Island to investigate the escape of a murderer.  But he learns that the prison facility is as escape-proof as can be.  The investigation gets deeper and darker as the hours progress, and the flashbacks of WWII soldier Daniels liberating a concentration camp adds to the forbidding sense that something is going to happen (by the way, the title sounds too much like \\"Shudder Island\\").  Staff psychiatrists played by Ben Kingsley and Max von Sydow add to the gloomy nature of the film.  Kingsley is a great Gandhi, but he can be spooky.  Max von Sydow is usually spooky.<br /><br /> Then the tale takes a turn.<br /><br />Without giving anything away, I just have to admit that  any potential \\"staging\\" in the plot was probably impossible, as were the conditions in Cell Block C.<br /><br />I was hoping for more.
B003AWRMCE|1.0|My impression of this movie was that it had no plot.  I watched the entire 131 minutes in hopes that something would develop to match the acting talents of Eastwood, Hackman and Freeman, the last of whom in my opinion was mis-cast into a roll expressing no strength of character.  Although, we were warned by the R-rating, I thought it went somewhat beyond that point by illustrating that real bravery and good shooting is gained by drinking excessively, and portraying prostitutes as perhaps having the best depth of character of anyone in the movie.  One good thing about it was that it ultimately ended.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|Just another classic Disney movie!   I was pleased with the condition the item came in and my niece loved the dvd as a Christmas present.  It also came at the exact time Amazon said it would.  Tracking it was easy and we had no problems at all!
1433503808|5.0|I love this Bible. I did a lot of research before I plucked down just under $50. for this Bible. Since I have many study Bibles I wanted to make sure I wasn't getting something that just repeated what I already had.   I was a little concerned about quality control after reading some of the reviews here. Since Amazon has a great track record of standing behind what they sell I decided to take the chance. I am glad I did. I looked through every single page and didn't find one problem.  I am so happy with the ESV version, with the notes, maps and articles in this Bible that I don't want to put it down. As mentioned by other reviewers it is a big Bible, not one you would likely carrying to Church.  I love everything about it. It lays open nicely. The cover has a nice feel to it. If you have problems with small print you might want to get the large print version. The notes are smaller print than the Bible text but my reading glasses took care of that. This is a Bible I would recommend to anyone who wants to seriously study the Bible. It is like a whole Bible study library in one volume. I highly recommend it.
B00005A8GY|5.0|I have a hard time agreeing with other reviewers on this CD.  It is one of the best reflections of what a SACD format CD should sound like.  When I play this for guests, that are Santana fans, they are blown away with the clarity of the music.  Perhaps it's the audio equipment the other reviewer have that didn't bring out the sound?  I have both the LP and the regular CD. The tubular bells on track one stand out, immediately having my guests turn to look at one another.  Black Magic Woman/Gypsy Queen kick butt.  My favorite track is Toussaint L' Overture.  I saw Santana in San Jose, at the Center for Performing arts, many years ago......sounds like I am there again, hearing this live.
B002ZG993Q|1.0|Waste of time to watch this movie.    No redeeming values whatsoever and lots of points against it.    Rather surprised that George took this role.
B000002J1Y|1.0|Music by YES is always great, but no one in my family wanted to listen to this CD. The disk is of incredibly poor quality. The vocals are hard to hear, drowned out by the overpowering tin sound of the accompaniment. It's impossible to enjoy the music when you can't hear the words and the little you can hear is mush. Very very dissapointed. We're returning ours asap.
B000MAK648|5.0|THE movie GRAND PRIX was the best auto racing movie I have ever watched.I originally watched  it at a cinerma theatre and the racing sequences were as amazing then as they are now.ALTHOUGH the movie was quite long it was the beginning of my lifelong love affair with auto racing.THE cars and drivers appear somewhat dated now it was the golden age of auto racing and there is much actual racing footage and the stars of the 1960s.THE movie also had a all star cast which was an added bonus.
0307454541|3.0|Yes, after seeing this book on the best seller list for a long time, I had to see what the excitement was all about.  I'll start by saying this was a hard read for me.  It took a long time to get motivated to continue on.  I had a difficult time keeping the characters straight and found myself flipping back again and again.  I also struggled with the Swedish names and references.  The story itself did pick up and it became interesting as time went on. There were a few good moments and surprises.  However, there was too much going on.  I wasn't crazy about the violence against women or about the lead character being desired by every woman he came in contact with - really!.  Some of the content I found quite revolting if not sickening.  Overall, it ended up being an interesting read but I'm still undecided if I'll read the next two books.
1615238948|5.0|The Kitchen House is a definite cut above the rest...one of the best books I've ever read.  It's a work of writing art with a compelling story inside where people and happenings becomes real with every word.
0439023521|4.0|I purchased The Hunger Games Trilogy as a gift for my 13 yr old.  I had no idea what it was about and became curious.  I decided to read The Hunger Games before handing it over to my child.  After only a few pages, I can honestly say I was shocked by the subject matter.  Why would a book about violence, death and child abuse be well suited for our young adults?  As an adult I can separate fact from fiction but can all young adults? I'm still not sure how I feel about this book.  I can say that it was a fast read and had many good points to the story.  I was however very disturbed by one scene and still can't get it out of my head (it comes near the end of the story). Overall, I liked the book and loved Katniss and Peeta. The book was hard to put down however I'm not dying to read the next two books of the series.  Personally I feel this is a book better suited for adults and most will enjoy it. I do not feel most children can handle the subject matter nor should be exposed to it.  I can only imagine they will have nightmares.  Just my opinion.
B004498KPU|3.0|I like the collection but I hoped the quality was better, and they didn't include the whole short film GOSTS that is amazing. I don't think Michael would be OK with it.  The cover is great but the most important thing is what it is inside.... Sony just wanted to get money out of it without thinkg about the fans, we want quality!
B001I9O9L8|1.0|Nothing irrates me more than having a concert interrupted.  I know this is a documentary of sorts, but there should be a way to watch the ENTIRE concert from beginning to end without cutting back to the 'documentary' sections.  Its bad enough that the interruptions happen in between songs, but it is inexcusable to cut to an interview IN THE MIDDLE OF A SONG.  I've owned the CDs of the concert since they came out and have enjoyed listening to them ever since.  I was very excited to get this on BluRay, thinking I'd be able to enjoy the concert.  However, this is a waste of time and a waste of money.  I want my $20 back.
B0036OS3Q0|5.0|I purchased 2 pair of these before Christmas on sale for gifts for my teenagers. I rarely buy name brand snow boots because the kids are pretty hard on them, but these were on sale so I have it a shot.  They are so awesome that I am going to purchase another pair for myself. These boots are great for snow play, keep your feet warm and dry, are made really well and look really cute to \\"boot\\"...sorry couldn't resist. Seriously, they are a great value and worth the $.
B004B8DH98|1.0|Has the look and feel of a foreign film and is just so extremely slow and boring I am amazed it even got published. I wouldn't even want to own it for free.
B0049D1TCM|4.0|In 2009 an underground MC, well known on the mixtape circuit for her cuttingly clever, caustic, and thought-provoking lyrics, began to make some noise in the mainstream by out-shining such well-established acts as Mariah Carey, Ludacris, Sean Kingston, and Kanye West on their own singles.  After a pair of scorching featured performances with her Young Money labelmates on a couple of posse cuts, the masses began clamoring for her solo debut.  What they received was not precisely what they expected.  Their idol, Nicki Minaj, one of the most talented MCs of any gender to emerge from the post-Jay-Z generation, had decided to take things in another direction.  Like her mentor, the eccentric and ubiquitous Lil' Wayne, she was no longer content with being the reigning queen of hip hop...she wanted to conquer the world of pop, and make a ton of money doing so.<br /><br />The problem is, despite her unimpeachable mixtape credentials, Minaj didn't yet have a decade in the game like Wayne did and as such hadn't yet established herself with the hardcore massive in quite the way that he had.  That being the case, the fact that she decided to go pop right from the jump had some serious consequences.  Many began to dismiss her as yet another radio friendly pop act, light on actual content, but heavy on catchy hooks, trendy fashions, and other such fluff as would gain her the ear and the disposable income of the average suburban teenager.  They were wrong, of course, but you couldn't tell them that.  Others deemed her a \\"sellout\\" who had abandoned the streets.  In a way, they were closer to the mark, but in this day and age, who isn't?  What \\"hardcore\\" rapper isn't interested in mainstream pop success and the monster payday that comes with it?<br /><br />Did Nicki go pop right from the jump on her first album?  Yes.  But is her lyricism in any way diminished on this release?  No.  With this album, Nicki, like her mentor Weezy, establishes herself as an MC who combines the most desirable aspects of the underground rapper and the pop star such a way as to leave little doubt concerning both her transcendent capabilities on the microphone and her unquestionable gift for exploiting the spirit of the times for her own financial gain.<br /><br />Those who decry this album as being \\"too pop\\" or \\"not hood/street enough\\" are unfairly endeavoring to place the artist in a box, ignoring the full gamut of her talents, and are missing the point.  Why does this album *have to be* \\"hood\\" or \\"street\\"?  Why can a pop acts crossover and make a \\"hardcore\\" record featuring Redman or some other rapper to establish their street cred but the door to success doesn't swing the other way?  Why can't a sista from the hood be a pop star?<br /><br />That aside, those who contend that the raw, cutthroat Nick her fans have come to know and love is totally absent from this disc must not be listening very closely.  Pink Friday may not showcase as much of her as her mixtapes and the Young Money records (Minaj herself laments the relative absence of this persona on the track \\"Dear Old Nicki\\"), but rest assured, she does make an appearance here or there, most noticeably on the diss track \\"Roman's Revenge\\" on which Nicki and Eminem rip Lil' Kim a new one, without naming names. If one considers this cut and Kim's attempted comeback \\"Black Friday\\" as the first round of a pay-per-view title fight, so far, Nicki Minaj is up 10-8 after dropping Kim early on with a flurry of devastating body blows. Whether the old vet has more in store for the later rounds, or even rises to answer the bell, remains to be seen.<br /><br />Nicki the monster is also showcased on several other tracks on the album including \\"Did It On'Em\\" and \\"Blazin'\\".<br /><br />But should the fact that not every cut is a gritty, grimy, battle rap detract from an appreciation of Minaj's clever, acrobatic flow and witty lyrics, both of which are more than evident on even the most radio friendly tracks on the album (such asthe heavy-rotation singles \\"Right Thru Me\\", \\"Your Love\\", and \\"Check It Out\\")? Who doesn't enjoy seeing a talented artist flex their muscles and grow and evolve over time? Nicki Minaj has transcendent skills on the mic, and incredible pop sensibilities, and I'd rather see her employ them both to claim her rightful place as a supernova burning brightly in the cosmos of popular music than to see her languish, pigeon-holed in the ultra-limiting category of \\"girl rapper\\", as so many before her have done. Nicki is the first female MC with the potential to shatter such constraints since the late, great Left Eye, and I for one am going to enjoy watching her spread her wings, be they hood regulation camo or Barbie pink, for many years to come.  Taken on its on merits, and not arbitrarily held in contempt for not being the \\"hardcore\\" bombshell so many wanted it to be, this disc is actually a decent debut.<br /><br />(As a side note, the extra tracks make purchasing the Deluxe Edition a worthwhile investment, especially the bouncy, dancehall-influenced \\"Muny\\", a new millennium successor to Madonna's legendary pop masterpiece \\"Material Girl\\".  Now all we need is a compilation disc of all of Nicki's 2009-2010 guest appearances on other people's tracks, and our collections will be complete.)the heavy-rotation singles \\"Right Thru Me\\", \\"Your Love\\", and \\"Check It Out\\")?

B003Q6D25K|1.0|if you thought this was scarie, or it made you jump out of your seat, then if someone farts you would jump. this movie and the 1st one are movies based around the whole \\"did you hear that\\" kinda thing. so if you watch it with the sound off, it will put you to sleep.
0061733199|5.0|While the sheer number of very positive reviews for this book speaks for itself, I generally enjoy reading negative reviews, since they often contain a grain of truth.  But the chief criticisms here seem to be the lack of detail.  To address these, I would probably have some devilish fun in pointing out that anyone who needs a mindless \\"paint-by-numbers\\" survival guide should probably just go ahead and lie down to die.  Survival will require creativity and imagination, so the enjoyable and concise vignettes provided in this book should indeed be a starting point of exploration -- for the person who wants to SURVIVE.  For example, the section on traps and snares got me thinking about all the possibilities ...  Aside from some editing mistakes which might make your average dressed-in-tuxedo english autocrat/aristocrat cringe, this book is more than worth the cost of a single double-scotch drink at the bar ... and might just save your life (if not your liver).  I can speak authoritatively that the \\"pedestrian soldier\\" learns how to operate some neat weapons, but doesn't get a whole lot of survival training -- that seems to be reserved for special forces.  So even a few experienced rifle-toters might benefit from this book (I did) ...  Sophisticated computer skills are important in the concrete wilderness, but let's not forget which jungle we came from (and how to last the night there) ...
B002ZG981E|2.0|I will be labeled a bad guy for this review as almost everyone I know say they love Inception. I did not and I will try to explain why.  Inception is a joyless movie that is far more interested in the complexity of its plot than the boundless imagination it could have with its subject matter. Dreams are where anything is possible, where people can fly do things they could not do in real life. It's an experience that frees us or traps us in a new world created and only restrained by our imaginations. Inception does it's best to keep all that at bay, as it needs to to fulfill the requirements of its plot. But in being so subservient to its plot Inception also drastically under develops it's characters to the point that I really didn't care a whole lot about any of them.     There is a small segment in Inception in which it glosses over its main character's backstory. That brief five minute synopsis should have been the movie.  It was a love story and a heartbreaking one at that. It would have been all emotion and all character driven. It could have played with the backdrop of dreams and been a great visual treat while staying true to the characters. Heck, it seems like a perfect Jim Cameron movie really.    But that is not the kind of movie Nolan makes. Even the Dark Knight would have been bogged down by it's own complexities without the marvelous performance by Heath Ledger. The Joker  brought a character that was profoundly having fun creating as much mayhem as he could. It injected fun and intrigue to a group of rather dry characters. Inception didn't have a character like the Joker. Not one character looked like they were interested in being there. In fact early in the scheme, one snag, and all of them wanted out, but none of them seemed too upset or concerned about going forward either. The characters just obeyed what was necessary for the plot to continue on and virtually ignored most natural human reaction or emotion. This also undercut to a large degree the danger these characters were in. They seemed rather unaffected by it for the most part.    So while I will give Nolan credit for creating a very complex and interesting concept, he needs to populate those type of stories with characters too. I think for a movie to really work for me I need to be invested in the Characters of a movie and Inception made a feeble attempt at that so I just couldn't get too excited about the movie as a whole.     Now let the sniping commence as I know that this is a minority opinion to say the least!
B001B1UO6W|5.0|This is one of my girlfriend's favorite horror movies. She said that she always wanted the 20th birthday edition of the movie. She absolutely loved it.

B003YUC9JI|4.0|After all, Jackie Chan do his best acting for this movie, I'm very enjoy and two tumbs up for this family movie
B000GTLQXU|5.0|A must have for the ship wreck fans and disaster fans. Another on the edge of your seat, action, dramatic, suspense, gut clencher, thrill seeker movie. I wanted to watch the special features to see how it was made and even that is cool.
1599218011|5.0|Many books tell us about the necessity of change. This book gives you the tools to change. Get it for yourself, and give it to those you love, and learn to truly be healed.
B00005JMXX|5.0|On the edge of your seat film, Heart pumper excitement and a film for those into action and suspense and apocalyptic futuristic type films. A real gut clincher.
B003X2O6KW|3.0|The album, as albums is pretty good, and it does contain many songs that have and will continue to become radio and club hits, having said that,I found two mayor, mayor problems. Number one, for a rap album there is a total lack of humor, no sense of whimsey, both musically and lyrically, even the Chris Rock participation feels too dark to produce any sense of joy. It made me miss big time The Love Below and many Beasty Boys albums, not that rap shouldn't be socially or politically engage and engaging, but music should be fun too, and when the subjects are too serious parody and satire can be as effective as a straight face comment.     The other mayor problem is that almost every song was recorder to destroy eardrums and speakers, many of the voices sound as if filtered through a bullhorn, the drums and base as distorted as psychedelic guitars. It wouldn't be bad if it was kept for moments in songs but some go all the way making the speakers sound broken, even worse with headphones. The only solution for me was to turn up the drum and the base low, which make music sound hallow, but I least I get what is going on with the voice, instruments and samples, or one can just play it on a big home or car stereo. So forget mp3/pocket CD player good experience.
0003303187|5.0|I first read this book more than forty years ago, and have re-read it periodically since then a half dozen times. I have given copies to my children, and to nieces and nephews. If you love children, or nature, or Greece...this is the book for you. If you do not fit in that category, get a life!<br /><br />Gerald Durrell may have written his books to fund his Zoo, but he is a born story teller, and the stories he tells are the best. I spent three summers in Greece as a child, and he has captured the langorous, limpid azure of the Greek skies in his prose, and the fascination of the abundant Nature of the Mediterranean. It does not hurt that his family, including Lawrence Durrell, are obviously all characters, and that their life was peppered with nutty occurences that may or may not be embellished a tad.<br /><br />To give this luminous classic anything less than five stars is niggardly and down right mean. Buy it. Treasure it. Reread it and give it to all the kids you know (and a few worthy adults as well)...
B004DK5CW4|3.0|The movie was good, but not great.  For non-horse people; they'll think it's wonderful.  For the horse person, who knows the story of Secretariat; they'll see all the flaws. For one, Penny Chenery was not present at the birth of Secretariat.  For another, the movie makes you think she was thrown into the world of horses with Secretariat.  Not the case, she was into it before that.  Does anyone remember Riva Ridge, the horse she had the year before Secretariat?  He won the Kentucky Derby and The Belmont in 1972.  She loved Riva Ridge. Sham's owner was not the jerk that Disney made him out to be, and Lucien Laurin was not the colorful, outlandish person they made him out to be, either.  And filming Secretariat's Triple Crown - Belmont win at Keeneland had no comparison to Belmont Park which is huge.  And what was with the gospel song when he won it.  I wanted to be swept away with emotion when he won that race. It was such a monumental victory that one needed to cry tears of joy. Instead I got a gospel song.  Don't get me wrong; Keeneland is a beautiful racetrack, but it's not Belmont or even close.  All in all, it was just good, unlike Seabiscuit that brought all the emotion and greatness of this horse to the screen so you could feel it.

B003KZZ4TO|5.0|Great Vinyl. Eminem is dirty. Great album. Highly recommend buying if you are into rap and Eminem and vinyl collector.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I've read this book a few times since it first came out. And while I seen to have more issues with style and characters as the years go by, I cannot forget the impact the book had on me when I first read it. Like Neuromancer much that was unique to this book has been incorporated into subsequent art and culture. The only thing I can say to those who don't like the book is that you kinda had to be there.    It's in my top five SciFi books.
0061733199|3.0|Never Know when you're gonna need this. Great for the avid camper that likes to live off the land, or is worried about getting lost.
B001U6YI92|5.0|Truly a classic movie. All the better in Blu-ray and the director's comments and extra minutes make it all the more enjoyable.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I absolutely loved Breaking Dawn, I couldn't put this one down. I was a little worried about the second part being told from Jacob's perspective, but suprisingly it was very good.  I know in life you don't always get what you want, but that's why this is fantasy/fiction.  Bella got everything she wanted.  One of my favorite characters is Alice, and when she took off I was upset, but it became clear to me she was up to something, so I guessed she would come back.  The entire Jacob/imprinting part is creepy.  It's the only part of the book I didn't really like at all.  I loved all of the different Vampires that came around to help, they were very interesting and I can't wait to see them all in the movie.  I thought The part with the Volturi was fantastic, I was glad that Bella's shield was able to be pushed and help everyone.  I'm a sucker for happy endings.  They aren't common in real life, so it was nice to read a happy ending.

B000QRIGLC|5.0|I have been in the U.S. Navy for 7 years.  Although I am not in the SPEC OPS community, I am part of a community in a combat enviroment. I have a great deal of respect for the training they go through and the missions they are assigned.  As for every service member there are several days that seem to never end, almost unbearable stress with sometimes no way to vent.  The long hours, the months away from home and civilization, the lack of time to eat a meal or even have one as well as the lack of time to even power nap and the arduos terrain amongst many other factors makes the job the most difficult and most compromising.  I find myself, along with so many others, battling these day in and day out.  When I recieved the book to my Kindle I immediately started reading it, not being able to put it down...captivating.  I read it again as soon as I was done with it.   Lone Survivor is now a tool in my tool box.  When I am under stress, hungry exhausted mentally and physically, deployed or on training missions, at times wishing I could walk away but knowing that giving up is not an option...I think of SEAL Team 10, Operation Redwing.  I think of LT. Murphy's heroism and Marcuss Luttrell's will to stay alive, evade the enemy and his dedication to bring back his fallen teammates home.  Lone Survivor, the story of Operation Redwing motivates me to not give up, stay in a combat mindset and be supportive to my teammates in whatever situation.  Whether you are a service member or not this book is an eye opener to the harsh realities or war, the split decisions that that make a difference and that being mentally and physically prepared to do whatever is key.  I am gratful for the job these gentlemen do in the SEAL community as well as everyone in any branch and I am also grateful for Marcuss sharing this event.
