B0014Z4OQG|3.0|i saw it in the theater and i don't think the story warrants for multiple viewings, the effects of the monster in the camera was good and the parasites were a riot, but you never get a good look at the monster , let alone a full view of it.. all i can say is it has the same anatomy as the monster in \\"the host\\",,walks on 2 front legs, long tail, breathing lungs on side of face, , too many similarities,,,this movie is not about the monster it is about some guy willing to risk all of his friends to look for some girl he forgot to tell he loved....you saw the box office receipts fall very quickly, the movie is worth renting...

B00133KFGW|2.0|It is difficult to say what this movie is really about.  We observe one night stand between rock star and classic musician and the product of that union is musical child prodigy.  Due to set of circumstances kid speands 11 years of his life in orphanage.  In his pathological desire to find his biological parents, kid runs away form the orphanage and changes his name from Evan Taylor to August Rush.  Before you know it, this kid can play every instrument in the universe, he is accepted at Juliard and composes a symphony for the Cetral Park public performance.  And of course, it all ends up happy.  There is no focus to this movie since it wants to cover too much.  Story may be good for a book but it is too unbelievable for the movie.  Acting is forced and feels fake at the time.  Body doubles with guitar playing, etc. are too obvious.  This movie is not for everyone.  Do not expect too much.
B00005MP58|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite repeat viewing movies. ( and have loaned it to SO many friends ) All the characters are richly delved, and once I started watching each movie, I was hooked. ( got miffed that I had to shut of the darn movie to go to work! lol ) Set in Regency England, Colin Firth was born to play Mr. Darcy, with all his character's arrogance and smoldering good looks. Jennifer Ehle is Elizabeth Bennet, whom Mr. Darcy dismisses at his friend's ball as a woman beneath his state.  There are secrets, silly family members ( Have to confess to wanting to use a tranquilizer dart on Mrs. Bennet ), and unexpected surprises and intrigues.  Darcy and Elizabeth's road to happiness is not easy, but well worth the wait.
B000YABYLA|4.0|Usually when the entire notion of teenage pregnancy is discussed the immediate reaction typically tends not to be humor. However, thanks largely in part to the release of a sensationally well done film, the trials and tribulations of teenage pregnancy and the decisions and implications associated with the ordeal have an interestingly humorous twist woven into the topic.<br /><br />While certainly the film is not meant to sensationalize or endorse teenage pregnancy as an issue, what writer Diablo Cote has done is taken a snapshot of one individuals plight of finding herself pregnant at age 16 to if nothing else simply cause a few chuckles within the mainstream culture. In the film Juno, Cote has written a unique and sarcastic-filled yet comedic plot that had even this skeptic laughing quite a bit throughout the film.<br /><br />Directed by Jason Reitman, Juno tells the story of a young high school lass who fills her day with a much more mature and cynical humor that is hard not to like. Juno McGuff (Ellen Page) is your typical high school student in just about every way: she gets picked on by the cooler kids, she hangs with her own group of friends and she finds herself falling love for a dork that she considered always to be a friend but perhaps never anything more. Paulie Bleaker (Michael Cera) is that nerdy track star friend who himself finds himself torn between whether he and Juno are truly an item.<br /><br />But thanks to an arm chair and some orange Tic-Tac candies, one thing led to another one crazy summer night and the next thing we know is that Juno finds herself pregnant. Though initially confronted with the realities of needing to make a wise and informed decision about what to do with the baby one way or another, a classmate helps Juno decide that giving the baby up for adoption was probably the best solution.<br /><br />Thanks to the local newspapers, Juno finds the picturesque couple looking to adopt a baby just as Juno was planning on having hers. Vanessa (Jennifer Garner) and Mark Loring (Jason Bateman) seem to be the idyllic adoptive parents to save the baby from the cruel realities of having a sixteen year old raise the baby yet their perfection is perhaps simply mired in false realities about what their relationship truly is. Interestingly, Juno and each one of the Loring's forge a relationship together in equally separate and interesting ways.<br /><br />What Juno brings to the viewer is a film that is simply ripe with decent comedy and one liners that are certainly well worth expensing a few calories to muster up a laugh for. Having been somewhat removed from the entire high school scene for some time now, thankfully some pretty awesome slang terms are also thrown into the film from time to time assisting the viewer in ensuring a proper jargon is always used when encountering high school students across the globe. Though parts of the comedy certainly are a bit off base, there is nothing overly gratuitous or profane about the comedy. Thankfully this is the case because the humor is simply good enough as is and does not need the tasteless humor often too rampant in movies today.<br /><br />The viewer need not become ultra conservative and completely shun this film based upon the general topic at hand, either. While certainly the film is centered around a sixteen year old that became pregnant, there is not a dramatic over representation of teenage sex and the film is more a comedic drama about the post romp life of Juno.<br /><br />Juno is a very well written, directed and acted film that brings together all the right elements of a good film. Although even this critic went into the film a bit skeptical that it would be nothing more than a teeny bopper chick flick, in actuality the movie was pulled together quite nicely and was a more than enjoyable watch. The only question that the film really left me with is why didn't orange Tic-Tacs work like that back in my day?Loring (Jason Bateman) seem to be the idyllic adoptive parents to save the baby from the cruel realities of having a sixteen year old raise the baby yet their perfection is perhaps simply mired in false realities about what their relationship truly is.

B0013D8LCW|5.0|I recently found this film, and can not wait until May 27th when it is released so that i can buy it. I have never written a review online before, but this film deserves to be seen. The main characters Zach and Sean are so sweet to one another and encouraging for each other that it makes this far better than most films. They trust one another and want each other to do well. i do not care for the sister character, but the little boy and Zach's best friend and Sean's brother are very good characters. The acting is stronger than most films, the story is very good. I almost felt like crying when the leads's sister keeps forcing him to take care of her and her son, while not having a life of his own. Thank god he meets and falls in love with Sean and that they end up taking care of her son, he will have a great life with two people who love him and love each other. A totally inspiring story.
B000WC3864|4.0|Well, they've got a lot of DVD extras.  LOTS!  But no \\"Within The Woods\\", and I guess that's because some fools want big money for their limited participation if it's ever distributed.  AND...no new Sam Raimi retrospectives...nor any old, dug-up interviews.  It's Raimi-free.  At least you can find old interviews on YouTube!  They got 2 younger, up & coming directors to cream all over Evil Dead, but they can't get Raimi to talk about his own damn movie!?  WTF!?  And Campbell's \\"new\\" footage is limited to his rants recorded in a group discussion at Flashback Weekend 2005.  Ho-well, another slightly-imperfect DVD release for a slightly-imperfect movie...but it's still good.  Almost all of the special features you saw in the Book of the Dead edition (sans Bruce Campbell's documentary \\"Fanalysis\\") plus many more new extras!  No one knows how to milk a movie for all its worth like Anchor Bay!  They will beat a dead horse until there's no more horse left to beat.

B0013FXWU6|5.0|Since hitting it big with 1997's critically-lauded \\"Boogie Nights,\\" Paul Thomas Anderson has stood in the front ranks of American filmmakers.  Actually, Anderson has crouched in the front ranks, dreaming about what would make a great shot and how he could do this scene or that scene, while all the other filmmakers stand around and chat.  For his fifth film, \\"There Will Be Blood,\\" Anderson has set aside his trademark Altman-esque lushness for a style which recalls Francis Ford Coppola in his prime.  Finally, Anderson stands in the front ranks - and it comes as no surprise that he has perfect posture.    The spine of \\"There Will Be Blood\\" is Daniel Day-Lewis, who stars as oil-drilling entrepeneur Daniel Plainview.  It is the single greatest performance of Day-Lewis' distinguished career as an actor.  To go further, it is one of the greatest performances in cinematic history.  Daniel Plainview is one of the most fascinating and complex protagonists ever seen on the big screen.  I use the term \\"protagonist\\" loosely.  Plainview is as slimey as the oil he has devoted his life to drilling, and as dangerous as the tools he uses to do so.  He may look human, he may sound human, and at times he may even act like a genuine human being, but if there is any humanity in this man, it is buried deeper than the oil he drills.    Plainview swindles people out of their homes, their property, their fortunes, without a care.  But what makes the character so interesting is the sneaking suspicion that he's not completely cold, that there is humanity in the depths of his soul, or was, at one point.  It seems like he may love his adopted son, H. W. (Dillon Freasier) - but just when we're sure he does, Anderson pulls the rug out from under our feet.  Plainview's memories of \\"back home,\\" recounted to his brother Henry (Kevin J. O'Connor), are worth noting.  Plainview talks about a house he saw when he was a boy.    \\"I thought as a boy that was the most beautiful house I'd ever seen, and I wanted it,\\" Plainview remembers.  \\"I wanted to live in it, and eat in it, and clean it.  And even as a boy, I wanted to have children to run around in it.\\"    Henry points out that Plainview can have anything he wants now.  He can make his own house, one that looks just like the house from his childhood.    Plainview grimaces.  \\"I'm sure if I saw that house now,\\" he spits, \\"it would make me sick.\\"    It's one of two scenes in the film which offer glimpses into Plainview's soul, or what remains of it.  The second also involves Henry: this time, Plainview admits, \\"I see the worst in people.  I don't need to look past seeing them to get all I need.  I've built my hatreds up over the years, little by little ... I can't keep doing this on my own, with all these ... people.\\"  He spits out the last part as though he'd swallowed an insect, and then he laughs.  The world is his own private joke.    But there can be no joking about Day-Lewis' performance.  Daniel Plainview is in his eyes.  He's in the way he talks, the way he moves, the way he breathes.  He is Daniel Plainview.  And though the film rests upon his broad and sturdy shoulders, he is supported by a similarly talented cast.      Highlighting the supporting cast is young Paul Dano, last seen as the irritating emo kid from \\"Little Miss Sunshine.\\"  Dano, as the media has noted, plays two different roles: brothers Paul and Eli Sunday.  Paul Sunday appears in only one scene, informing Daniel Plainview of the wealth of oil ready to be drilled on the Sunday farm.  Eli Sunday is, essentially, the head of the Sunday family, and even the head of the town.  He leads the local church, and delivers passionate sermons that are, frankly, godawful.  He is also the thorn in Daniel Plainview's side.  It's the perfect role for Dano to showcase a depth not even hinted at in his previous roles.  He may be one to watch out for in the future.    Dillon Freasier is also noteworthy.  There is something absolutely fascinating about his distant and confused portrayal of H. W. Plainview.  He seems like the embodiment of all the good devoid from his adoptive father.  This is Freasier's first film role, but he's already make his mark.    Paul Thomas Anderson, on the other hand, made his mark a decade ago, but only with \\"There Will Be Blood\\" has he truly had an impact on cinematic history.  Though elements of the film may recall the work of Stanley Kubrick, or the work of Robert Altman (who was one of the biggest influences on Anderson's previous films), this is the first film Anderson has made which has felt wholly original.  It's the work of a true visionary.  Finally, Anderson feels like the god behind-the-scenes who ties together all the threads of existence, rather than the gifted puppetmaster with a vision as he may have seemed before.  Each shot, stunningly photographed by Robert Elswit, has a beautiful directness which recalls the glory days of Hollywood studio epics.    Thematically, \\"There Will Be Blood\\" recalls one classic in particular: John Huston's \\"Treasure of the Sierra Madre.\\"  Huston's dark masterpiece, which revolved around two beggars who wind up a trip to Mexico and discover a wealth of gold in the hills, has a lot in common with Anderson's own bleak masterpiece.  Both portray the corruption of the human soul as inevitable, although \\"Blood\\" is a little less harsh in its delivery of the statement.  At the start of each film, audiences are allowed the tiniest bit of hope, which is gradually squeezed until there is nothing left to do but submit to this frightening vision of humanity.  Lastly, both films end on a comic note, albeit a blood-stained note for Anderson's film.  He's said that he watched \\"Treasure of the Sierra Madre\\" every night during production before going to bed.  Suffice to say it shows.    As far as editing goes, \\"There Will Be Blood\\" owes a lot to the taut, scene-into-scene style of Stanley Kubrick, particularly \\"The Shining.\\"  \\"Blood\\" is edited by Dylan Tichenor, who also edited \\"Boogie Nights\\" and \\"Magnolia.\\"  \\"Boogie Nights\\"' pacing recalled the work of Martin Scorsese, while \\"Magnolia\\" moved with the frenetic pacing of an Altman movie on crack.  Anderson's last picture, 2002's \\"Punch-Drunk Love,\\" is among the most lush, dreamy movies in recent memory; that film's editing was smooth and breezy.  Even the most astute moviegoer would have a hard time believing that the same man who brought you the film where Adam Sandler acts or the movie where the sky rains frogs has now brought us this hulking, somber reflection on the human spirit.    One final note: the score is composed by Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood.  As one might expect, it's a bit of an oddity, which makes it all the more fitting for a movie like this.  It is certainly among the most sparse film scores in history, but its unusual instrumentation renders it one of the more interesting and potent soundtracks of the new millennium.    Just how good is \\"There Will Be Blood\\"?  It's good enough to drink the milkshake of any other movie released this decade.  It is the finest film of 2007, surpassing even the Coens' extraodinary \\"No Country for Old Men\\" - but better still, it's one of the best movies ever made.  Very, very few films this century have come near this level of greatness - in fact, only Peter Jackson's \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy comes to mind.  \\"There Will Be Blood\\" is a film which makes a powerful statement through powerful filmmaking.  Its performances are peerless, its photography is beautiful and direct, its editing is classically tight, and its direction - well, P. T. Anderson may not be Scorsese or Coppola yet, but by god, he's on his way.

B000O77SRC|5.0|Arguably, `Die Hard' is just an action movie.  Inarguably, `Die Hard' is `the' action movie; as in the action movie that all other action movies can only aspire to become.  `Die Hard' is intense, absorbing, entertaining and completely `edge of your seat' worthy from start to finish.  Director John McTiernan did a masterful job of getting the action just right, of editing the film in such a way that each scene brilliantly leads right into the next, never losing its intensity or losing its audience.  Add to that one of the greatest action performances ever and you have one thrilling movie that is prime for repeat viewing after repeat viewing.<br /><br />`Die Hard' introduces us to John McClane, NYPD.  You'll want to remember that name, for next to Ripley it's the only `action star' name you'll ever need to know.  Forget Ethan Hunt or even James Bond (well, you can remember James Bond I guess) because John McClane is the definition of action star.  Well, I guess I should say that Bruce Willis is the definition of action star, but you get my drift.  When the LA building his wife happens to be in is taken hostage by a group of terrorists planning a robbery, McClane takes matters into his own hands and wages a war against the terrorists from inside the building.  The LAPD isn't making things any easier, but John has the help of one particular officer.<br /><br />The plot is fine but it's the action that really makes `Die Hard' an instant classic.  It breathes new life into the genre and pushes the envelope in ways that no other action film has done.  `Die Hard' is a movie that will never get old or become outdated.  It holds up even today, twenty years after its release, proving to be just as good if not better than most of the so called `action' films that get released today.<br /><br />The acting is also a highlight, especially that of Bruce.  It saddens me that the Academy can often be so dense and blind.  In my personal opinion Bruce gave one of the best performances of the year.  He was natural and witty, charming and brooding all at the same time.  He created an iconic character, and that is hard to do.  John McClane is a household name.  Alan Rickman is also a pleasure to watch here.  As Hans Gruber he creates a prime bad guy, someone cunning, masterful and of course evil.  Reginald VelJohnson feels like he playing a lengthened version of his character on `Family Matters' and comes off a bit mechanical, but it's forgivable.  Bonnie Bedelia nails her performance as McClane's wife.  She filters through her characters emotions well.<br /><br />In the end `Die Hard' is a classic film that I'm sure many of you have already seen.  If you haven't seen it then I urge you to go out and see it ASAP.  `Die Hard', like I've already mentioned, is a film that stands the test of time.  It is just as up-to-date as the films being released today.  There is no other film like it, and there most likely will never be an `action' film that can top it.ural and witty, charming and brooding all at the same time.

B00003CXFV|5.0|I don't understand how anyone couldn't love Julia Roberts.  I mean I guess I can see how maybe she just isn't your brand of actress, but truly, she is extraordinary.  She has turned out classic performance after classic performance and is a standup person to boot.  Her portrayal of Erin Brockovich may actually be one of her most challenging roles and she delivers it with such precise determination and dedication that she becomes so real and engaging and truly memorable.  The best thing about `Erin Brockovich' though is that Roberts is not the only reason to stay and watch.  Sure, she has everything a movie star needs to keep her audience at her beck-and-call, but Soderbergh (who had such a marvelous year in 2000) doesn't rely solely on Roberts to carry his film.<br /><br />`Erin Brockovich' sports a brilliant script penned by Susannah Grant that utilizes fact with Hollywood drama and peppers in enough humor and charm to make the film stand out apart from your everyday biopic.<br /><br />The film tells to story of Erin Brockovich, a brash young single mother who winds up working for attorney Ed Masry.  Erin doesn't always rub people the right way, but her blunt self-confidence carries her a long way in the legal world, especially when she takes it upon herself to investigate further a case involving a power company and their blatant disregard for the health of the citizens of Hinkley, California.  As Erin becomes absorbed in the case her personal life starts to take a turn as she meets her kind-hearted yet gruff-exteriored neighbor George.  `Erin Brockovich' does a masterful job of melding this woman's personal and professional life together in a way that makes both sides of her interesting and entertaining, never once waning.<br /><br />One of the main reasons to watch this film is to witness the rapport between the actors on the screen.  Julia Roberts is a standout, obviously, but everyone involved pulls their weight and works wonderfully together.  Albert Finney is flawless as Ed Masry and should have won that Oscar.  His chemistry with Roberts is beautiful to witness, just beautiful.  In infuses this sense of paternal concern into his performance that makes Masry a likable and relatable character.  Another standout is Aaron Eckhart who marvelously captures the heart of George.  He plays to Roberts strengths and helps keep the personal side of this story lively and tender.<br /><br />In the end, `Erin Brockovich' is a film that stands on its own, a film that deserves to be seen and lauded.  Roberts received countless amounts of praise for her performance (and a much deserved Oscar to boot) but I think the Academy Award nominations for Supporting Actor, Screenplay, Director and Best Picture speak for themselves in declaring just how impressive this film really is.and should have won that Oscar.

B000OCXMAE|1.0|I am a huge Linkin Park fan, I nearly cried when I first heard this release.  It was terrible!  Worse than terrible.  After I hand listened it I turned to my boyfriend and said \\"The alternative music market must be too easy for them because this is soft rock - they sound like fricken U2!\\".  I got the making of with the CD and thats pretty much what they said, they were branching out to reach a wider audience.  Well I hope they realize they are alienating their existing fans.  If you are into pop and soft (soft, soft, soft) rock... this is for you, if you are a fan of the Linkin Park sound... this is a waste of money because its simply not there.

B000YABYLA|4.0|I saw the preview for the movie \\"Juno\\" long before it was released, and I made note of it.  I saw it a couple weeks after it came out, and it was entertaining - AS FILMS ARE MEANT TO BE.  If you want something educational and inspiring, watch \\"An Inconvenient Truth\\" or a documentary.      Sheesh, people, so many of you one-star raters are taking this SO seriously!  If this movie inspires a pregnant teen girl to keep her child, so be it!  I'm sure pro-life people love that aspect of the film.  I think that the choice to keep or terminate a pregnancy is and always should be up to the mother/parents, but if you honestly think this film is going to inspire teen girls to treat pregnancy in a flippant way, you must be joking.  And those of you that think teen girls aren't getting knocked up should do your research.    But back to the film.  I found the idea of a teen taking responsibility for her actions and being supported by her parents to be refreshing.  I like the portrayal of Jennifer Garner's character as a woman determined to be a good mother even in a tough situation as a good message as well.  I especially liked the tongue-lashing Allison Janney (Juno's mom) gives to the judgmental OBGYN nurse.    Yes, I do think that the dialogue Juno engages in is a bit too hip and adult for a 16-year old.  Yes, I do think she and Bleeker (her boyfriend) are a weird match, given his teenage realism and her budding hipster-ness.  Yes, I think the music in the film was a bit odd, but have any of you listened to college radio lately?  This is pretty accurate with this indie music that is being played.  Yes, I think it is sad that some adoptees face difficult, heart-rending situations in some instances, but DON'T take it out on this movie!  I give it four stars, like it or not.
B0009KA7BS|4.0|Constantine was a very pleasant surprise. All the warning flags were up: a much-changed Alan Moore comic book premise (shifted from the UK to LA), a music video director and Keanu Reeves reunited with his dire Chain Reaction co-star Rachel Weisz. Luckily the changes take, the director actually knows how to tell a story and play a scene and Rachel Weisz has learned to act a little in the intervening years. It's damned hero (even Tilda Swinton's rather wonderful Archangel Gabriel tells him \\"You're f****d.\\") trying to buy his way into heaven by `deporting' demons is worthy of a franchise of his own, and the film is far more imaginative and entertaining than you'd expect. It's just surprising that, with lines like \\"God's just a kid with an ant farm,\\" the fundies didn't firebomb the theatres that played it.

I can see the barns, the trees, and even the rocks when he jumps to save himself from a 'Draccus.'<br /><br />After I get the chance to finish the trilogy, I will probably take a flashlight and read these books under the covers. I will feel the same way that I felt as a fifteen - sixteen year old girl as I read the Lord of the Rings and  Andre' Norton's Witch World.
B000ASATYO|3.0|The director's cut of The Frighteners doesn't help the film's awkward shifts of tone much, but then this always seemed like two or three good ideas that never really gelled into the same movie. The idea of Michael J. Fox's paranormal investigator running a scam with a trio of real ghosts who haunt the houses he charges to exorcise is never given enough of a comic workout, just as the inspired idea of an undead serial killer trying to beat the competition in the body count stakes because \\"the title should be held by an American\\" never becomes a genuinely chilling figure. There are a few neat twists, but the film still feels more like it had a pitch and a treatment rather than a solid script, offering only a third as much fun as it really should. Still, no complaints about the lavish extras on this flipper disc (theEuropean release spreads the same extras over a 3-disc set) - aside from the usual deleted scenes and trailer there's even a four hour documentary produced by Jackson!
0307237702|4.0|Overall, it was a good read. Obama is quite articulate and not too long-winded. The title \\"The Audacity of Hope\\" just about sums up the whole book.    He promotes what he calls \\"a new kind of politics\\". I applaud this aspiration, but I cannot help but question its plausibility. Throughout the book, you will come across Obama as the nice guy who tries to please everyone, who never disagrees with anything completely and who always seems desperate to be politically correct regardless of the issue in discussion. Now, it is always good to try to be sympathetic to all points of view, but ultimately a politician has to make decisions. A politician considers all the available facts, weighs all the opinions being offered from all sides, pays close attention to his own thoughts and chooses. Maybe it's because he's trying to please everyone too much, but I sometimes got the feeling that I do not clearly understand his standings on certain issues.    I give him credit for providing his opinions, but I do not think the solutions he suggests are very original. I'm sure we've all heard those countless times before. He's a very charismatic and thoughtful young man and he'd definitely make a better president than John McCain. But as of now, Hillary still has my vote.

B00005V1B2|4.0|Luis Mejia (son) - Based on Paul Gallico's novel, The Snow Goose seems to be Camel's piece which moved into an important place in progressive rock, and a hughe vantage point for the band. The album is fully instrumental, in this aspect, the vocal problem Latimer had always presented is covered into a mainstream of sounds and atmospheres, in which the tltle itself says \\"music inspired by the snow goose\\", the music covers each important passage of the novel through their own music, the plot and characters, as for me, I've never read the novel, but readers could be surprised, I'm not saying they'll be pleased, because even Paul Gallico was about to take legal action because the name of the band had always been confused with a branch of cigarettes called camel, and he didn't want that kind of publicity!<br /><br /> All in all, the music has had some of the most famous riffs even in rock music, the flute in \\"Rhayader\\", the arrangements in \\"Rhayeder Goes To Town\\", the guitar potential and charisma of \\"The Snow Goose\\", and the reprising \\"La Princess Perdue\\" are some of the most recognizeable examples. The special thing of the album is that Camel finally got their musical sense into interpreting novel pieces, and that finally gave sense to their direction, and as many fans may say it is overprized, what it is so special is that it is one of their most accessible pieces of their original era, but yet there is the problem of the music itself, the style is outreaching, but the music is simplistic prog, no gem, no archaic effort, but I think that was the purpose itself Camel always expected from their music, plus, the album reached silver status in sells, and had become somewhat of a legend in prog history.
B00009L1OB|3.0|I'm commenting on the remastered sound here, not on the music. However, I will say that Duran Duran are one my favorite groups, and this is a great album overall. Unfortunately, this remaster is dull. The sound level is louder, but that doesn't really mean anything. You control the volume knob. The soundstage is two-dimensional; the dynamic range is squashed; the bass is weak, and the high frequencies are a little distorted. Is the original CD perfect? Of course not. But it didn't sound too bad either. Rio is a different story--the original CD mastering was poor, and the reissue sounds significantly better. Seven and the Ragged Tiger was remastered by a different engineer at a different studio and sounds worse in basically every way. This is one of those cases where you're better off staying with or finding the original issue CD.
0307394549|5.0|I just got this book a few days ago and I'm excited to test them all out. So excited, that I as soon as I flipped thought the book (with full color photos of every cookie) I decided that I would make each and every one of them. I even started a blog to document my journey through this process [...] I've only baked the Chewy Molasses Crinkles on page 83 so far and hope to bake another cookie soon.    I understand the reviews about Martha repackaging a product, but that is what she is good at. I've never found the need to purchase one of her cookbooks before because I could find things in the magazines, shows and online. However, the full-color photo index and categories of cookies make this well worth the buy. Plus, whether you're a seasoned baker, or a bit afraid of the entire baking process, there are recipes at all levels - not to mention the tips and general info found in the back. This is a great book for yourself or to give as a gift. I can't wait to make all 175 cookies and take my cookie baking and tasting to a new level!
B000002AGM|5.0|Groundbreaking stuff!<br />Somehow, when people speak of the demise of big bands they tend to overlook the modern(ist) versions of the form - either Gillespie's various big bands or the glorious collaboration of Miles Davis and the arranger Gil Evans...<br /><br />Cool jazz has rarely sounded so subtle and intelligent, flugelhorn has rarely sounded so lyrical, big band has rarely sounded so smooth, with the occasional brass stings, sometimes even shrieks (very typical for otherwise very calm Evans' orchestral work), complementary to the leader's sensitive playing (Miles is the only soloist of the album).<br /><br />Originally, on the vynil record, the songs were connected into a continuous suite, at the same time marking the modern approach and suggesting how connected this new movement was to the father of jazz orchestration- Duke Ellington (for whom one of the songs is named \\"The Duke\\"). In the original liner notes the great French jazz critic Andre Hodier discusses shortly that link as well as pointing out how fresh, unique and original this Miles' and Gil's collaboration actually is.<br /><br />Personally, I actually prefer \\"Sketches of Spain\\" ( [[ASIN:B00003XAQ6 Sketches of Spain]] ) and \\"Porgy and Bess\\" ( [[ASIN:B000VDD23I Porgy and Bess]] )  to this album, but that's just a matter of nuances in the listener's taste. You should compare these Davis-Evans collaborations for yourselves and make your own lists...<br /><br />Basically, quite different than Miles' small group work (see for instance  [[ASIN:B0000026C5 Milestones]] and  [[ASIN:B00000I41J Somethin' Else]] ), this orchestral opus equally highlights the Davis unique importance to modern jazz, at the same time serving as the best possible credit for his magnificent arranger Gil Evans.<br />p.s.<br />As a purchase option, check out this amazon link [[ASIN:B000UZD4D0 Original Album Classics]]

One thing I loved especially was the way the director used several frames he filmed to create a comic book like look.

0143113100|5.0|This book is not a 'self help' book in the classic sense - its a series of case studies of \\"neuroplasticity' - In short, scientists used to think the brain was 'hard wired' and little if anything could be done to change the brain after a certain age. While the brain does become less 'mailable' as time goes on, the ground-breaking cases in this book show the brain's remarkable ability to change itself - even previously 'incurable' cases of dyslexia and other conditions.    Often the changes are greater than those tried with drugs and surgery yet simply require mental exercises - for example ADD children are taught the now forgotten disciplines that were once common in schools - aural memorization and penmanship.    These stories are inspiring not only to people with these conditions, but  to anyone who wishes to improve their minds who previously thought they were 'stuck'

B000H0MKGK|5.0|This is John Mayer's strongest album to date. Going to a blues roots type of album and away from a pop sound was a very smart move. Subsequently, this album crossed over into the 'pop' charts. I think this albums is what John Mayer does best as his previous two albums don't even come close to Continuum.<br /><br />This is one of the few albums I actually paid full price for and don't regret doing so. Smart, catchy personal songs that we all can relate to. I'm a lyric person in that I won't like a song if the lyrics don't resonate with me even if the song is the catchiest song ever. Continuum absolutely does not disappoint there.

B0014Z4OQG|4.0|One time, a movie is announced to be in development which sends fans and moviegoers into a frenzy and hype and constant discussion keep going to the point of its release date. But then, in a sudden realization of \\"oh yeah, this was a movie, right?\\", people realize a good premise and a neat idea might not make a good film. That film was \\"Snakes on a Plane\\" where just the story sounded more fun than what the film did with it and in a way, Cloverfield suffered the same fate. First appearing as an enigmatic teaser trailer before \\"Transformers\\", many people were abuzz about this new film, shot in a unique style with a very familiar genre. But is this a good film, or just a good idea stretched too long?    Rob Hawkins is going away to take on a very impressive job in Japan and his brother, Jason along with girlfriend Lily plan a surprise going-away party for him one night. Documenting the night is \\"Hud\\", who's kind of a goofball and who also has eyes for Marlena, who doesn't even know Rob but came along anyway. But the celebration's cut short when earthquakes happen, explosions occur in the distance and a roaring sound is heard from down the street.    I always like watching these bigger-than-life movies but there was always something \\"filmy\\" about it and the great directors like Spielberg and Cameron know how to let the direction tell the story while still maintaining that sense of tension and excitement. Yet, with a movie, entirely shot to make it look like it was on a handheld will have some issues with people. Why does everything look so staged, as if certain glimpses of the monster are just fleeting enough and most people wouldn't shoot the way he does. But it's also fun to see a monster movie in a very compacted style and it helps bring out the reality even when you know they had to break out the computers for most of this stuff. While I personally never got sick of all the handheld moving every which way, some are going to find it distracting the camera never seemsto wanna sit still.    Despite that, the film is actually quite exciting and when things get loud and frantic, there's actually quite a lot of suspense and pulse-pounding stuff that goes on and even though it's not completely showing you all you'd like to say, it's quite a blast to watch actually. And forgive the fact that a store-bought video camera will produce a theatre-ready sound experience too since it's nitpicking; although to be fair, there's a lot of weird plot things you can balk at. With quite a few memorable images and sequences, it probably won't make sense all the way through but at least it's fun anyway.    However as a film, it doesn't entertain quite so much since the good rule of thumb for a horror movie is have likable, relatable characters first and then throw them in the fire and even after some scenes at a party, we still don't get a full sense of the characters. While we're not going to exactly have characters all of a sudden monologue after being attacked by a 350-foot creature and there's even some moments for the actors to get a bit emotional, it doesn't really feel enough either.     Let's face it: the big release this week is this movie so I bet most people are going to watch this anyway. Whether or not you like it is something else but I enjoyed it.

B0010YSD7M|5.0|I started watching the original Stargate movie, and while I thought it was good (maybe 3.5 out of 5 stars) I really wasn't interested in seeing an entire series devoted to the concept.  I still remember recording a couple eposodes of Stargate SG1 off of the SciFI channel a few years after it first aired, and being absolutely mesmerized.      Since then, I've seen every eposode, some a few times.  Yes, I'm an addict.  Still, I didn't weep when the series ended.  I thought it had done a great job of exploring its reality.    But there were a lot of loose ends.  The Ark of Truth ties many of these off, and in doing so, creates much of the excitement that permeated the first season of the series.  Good writing, great cinematography, a tight plot, and a cast we all love.    OK, can we have another?
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a very challenging DVD and I use it only about 3 times a week, I was working out much more before this, and I am seeing and feeling results. I wish I had time to use it more frequently, but I work 12 hour shifts. This is great for someone who doesn't have much time but wants a challenge. It is not easy, but it works! I believe anybody who uses this dvd will see a change fast, if they do it correctly. I had reached a plateau and was becoming very discouraged, now I realize I was spending more time working out, but without enough intensity. Jillian makes it clear you don't have to spend all this time working out if you work out with enough intensity and actually push yourself and sweat. This dvd is awesome! There is no excuse not to do it either because the workouts are only 20-30 minutes.
B00005JPUN|1.0|With Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig, The Invasion should be good. But it isn't. The people responsible for this film managed to make it just another zombie movie. In fact, it's worse than most zombie movies. Give me even a new Romero film over this one. At least the new zombie movies--even the bad ones--usually feature some critique of our culture. But The Invasion has nothing. Nothing.     Well, there is that one thing. The movie's main premise is that the world would be better if we were all zombies. No more wars, no more pain. The people who become zombies are actually happier once they turn. But this doesn't really make sense. Let's draw out the conclusion, shall we? The zombies still need to eat, which means that they still need to have resources like food and, therefore, money. Hence, there will still be a power struggle. Will there still be homeless people? Will there be presidents?     So is the movie suggesting that the kind of communism or even socialism so desired by liberals won't work? Is that the main point? It's not brought up in the film at all, but I think it's lying dormant underneath. The problem is that the movie isn't good enough to make it a primary concern. If it were a primary concern, it would probably be a better movie.
1400049628|5.0|Max Brooks' Zombie Survival Guide is a fantastic and fun read, a total blast from beginning to end, but its not for everyone.  In fact, its important to understand what this book really is before you buy it.  So, lets clear up a few misunderstandings.<br /><br />1. It is not a laugh out loud comedy.  In fact, placing this book under the \\"comedy\\" heading is some what of a misnomer.  I don't know where else it could possibly go, but I think that categorization is what gives people the wrong impression most often.  I mean, honestly, I don't know what some of the numb nuts out there were expecting or why ANYONE would want to buy a book of one note, stupid \\"zombie\\" jokes in the first place, but whatever... Bottom line: this isn't a joke book.  There's no knock-knock zombie jokes, there's no lame zombies-slipping-on-a-banana-peel sight gags and there are no rehashings of those age old, tired clich&eacute;s of the \\"zombies as consumers\\" type (oh no, I'm sorry, suburban rebel, you really are the first to use that metaphor, really, I mean it and its not obvious and worn out in any way, really, I promise, its very fresh.)  The \\"joke\\" of the book, if there is one, is to skewer all those asinine home preparedness survival manuals that swept the market in the wake of 9-11.  The idea of Joe Average Nobody buying a book that upon reading would fully ready him for a radiological/biological type terrorist attack is as laughably stupid as the average real world person buying a book to prepare for a zombie apocalypse.  Get it?  Its not a laugh out loud joke, its not even a slight chuckle joke, it's a middle finger to a market built on instilling and perpetuating people's fear and exposes it all for the sham that it is.  For some reason though, this confuses the hell out of certain slope fore-headed mouth breathers, like they expect the book to be Jim Carrey versus zombies or something and for some reason, seem to think that this would be a good idea.  Let me assure you, this is NOT the case and if this is what you are looking for... GO AWAY!<br /><br />2. Make no mistake, though, this is NOT a novel either.  There is no story, with the possible exception of occasional linking threads running through the \\"History of Outbreaks\\" section towards the end.  There are no characters, there is no climax or resolution.  It is a survival guide.  That is it and yes, the book does take itself seriously.  No, it does not break character and wink at you knowingly, it plays it straight all the way through.  The delivery is part of the joke, understand?  Deal with it, okay?  Now, get ready for the hard part.  Okay ready?  Here goes:  The joke is not the main and only point.  Do not expect it to sustain the book for its entirety, that duty belongs to the fact that...<br /><br />3. Its made for fans of the genre.  If you are not a fan of zombies, then don't bother, man.  This book is NOT accessible to non-fans, that's just the way it goes and if you expect otherwise then you are a fool.  Look, I don't watch Sex & the City and you know what else I also don't do?  I don't buy crap related to the show and then go on-line and complain about how much I don't like it.  If you don't like zombies and the stuff that goes with it, then this book isn't for you.  If you don't have a favorite version of the original Dawn of the Dead, then this book isn't for you.  If you have never made a mental plan in your head one long boring day at work as to what you would do if the Zombie Apocalypse caught you out at the job, then this book isn't for you.  If you've never found yourself considering how to defend your regular person home from a horde of zombies and how to turn it into an impromptu fortress, then this book IS NOT for you.  If you do NOT relate to those type of things, then do NOT buy this book.  But on the other hand, if you do relate... well then, my friend, you MUST buy this book and you must do so right now.<br /><br />The reason a fan needs to have this book is becauseit is made for you.  It is a total analysis of our much loved culture based on our silly zombie apocalypse speculation.  It is full of all the things you've thought of and some things that you have not.  It is full of all the things you like and all the things you disagree with.  It is endless fodder for excited discussion with your fellow zombie heads and it is a fertile field ripe with inspiration for your own projects.<br /><br />My Recommendation: This is a complete and total good time and as necessary on your shelf as your Romero films.  No zombie fan is complete without it.analysis of our much loved culture based on our silly zombie apocalypse speculation.

B000ZINGIK|5.0|The Scarecrow was my first foray into Avantasia. I had never even heard of Tobias Sammet before in my life. So it was all the more shocking when I discovered that I really like this CD. From start to finish, every song is memorable and catchy. All of the additional players in this game certainly add considerable greatness to the fold. Jorn Lande, in particular, is magnificent here, possibly trumping anything else he has ever done in his career. I personally do not care for Sammet's voice. It's just a little too screechy and uncontrolled. But when he blends it in with everyone elses' voices, it sounds wonderful. Michael Kiske is also good here, as well as that other dude (can't remember his name...). As others have stated here, the title track is the resident \\"epic\\", though it really is too long. They could have easily cut out the three minutes of noise in the middle of it. But when Lande starts belting it out, oh my God. It will knock your socks off. And I mean that literally. You will have to buy new socks. But anyway, I think the only dud on this whole CD is \\"I Don't Believe in Your Love\\". Other than that, every single song is outrageously good. Get this CD as soon as possible. And don't forget the socks...
B000BGR0OM|4.0|Nice collection of Eurthmics with most of their big hits.  Great for keeping you calm in traffic
B000YABYLA|4.0|I'll be honest here. This movie surprised me by being better than I thought it was going to be. By all the buzz garnered by the Oscars, I knew Ellen Paige would turn in a good performance (the only other role I had seen her in was X-Men). What surprised me most was the amazing performances given by Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman. Bateman's character especially was fun as a character study. You could tell he was trying to live through Juno and regain some of his lost youth. And their relationship got to a point where I almost cringed (it was creepy how close they were...). But all of this came together to form a cohesive and funny tale. The language was a bit silly in some parts, full of hipster slang and whatnot (and that's coming from me - a teenager!), but for the most part it seemed pretty real to life. A good film overall that is worth a rental at least.
B000N6TYLW|5.0|The entire collection of this show, one of the best written ever on TV, will be so great to have for future generations. Timeless and compelling relationships, intelligently written.
B000UX6TRK|1.0|I really enjoy listening to Lionel Richie and was looking forward to purchasing this DVD.  That is until I read the reviews here on Amazon. After doing some checking online I've come to the conclusion that almost everyone who has purchased this has ended up with a defective copy and the producers ignore the fans who contact them.  So sadly this is one fine concert that I won't be adding to my collection. My advice is you want to find out for yourself put away your wallet and get it from the library if you still want to hear it.
B0013FBS20|3.0|Good movie but I expected more from the Blu-Ray version in terms of more scenes explaining how they made such a mess with the cancer vaccine.

B00154GEFU|5.0|\\"Phoenix\\" is, I think, what Asia should have been from the outset. This is, in my opinion, the band's most varied album musically. I hear more of Steve Howe's contributions here than I did on either the debut album or its follow-up, and that's a definite plus. Howe reportedly left the band because he had been relegated to a bit player behind John Wetton and Geoff Downes, but the new album really makes up for that.    Wetton's voice is as rich as ever. I would never have guessed at his health problems based on his performance here, which so far surpasses anything John Payne (with his overly forced, throaty vocals) ever contributed to Asia-light. Not only does Wetton put Payne to shame as a singer, he runs rings around him as a songwriter, producing melodic pieces infused with heart and soul. This is not to say that Payne's work is altogether without merit, but more rather a tribute to Wetton's ability, creativity and musical instincts.    Some reviewers have commented that some of the material on the new CD seems closely related to the two Icon releases. But why shouldn't it? These two CDs are the most recent collaboration between Wetton and Downes and a natural precursor to \\"Phoenix.\\" What's more, they're both killer albums in their own right. In fact, I'd venture to say that, despite its overall excellence, no single track on this album can equal the soaring grandeur of \\"To Catch a Thief\\" off the \\"Rubicon\\" release.    Here some hightlights from the album (you'll notice that most of the songs are covered here, which indicates just how good it is). In no particular order:    \\"Never Again\\" is a great title for the first song on the CD, reminiscent of the Eagles' reunion under the title \\"Hell Freezes Over.\\" The original Asia's albums almost always start out with a hard-driving rock anthem, and this is definitely in that vein. I'm not sure it quite lives up to \\"Heat of the Moment,\\" \\"Don't Cry\\" and \\"Go,\\" but it's definitely a worthy follow-up to those classics.    \\"Overand Over\\" features the sort of guitar work prominent on Yes albums, circa \\"Going for the One\\" and Howe's solo album \\"Beginnings.\\"     \\"Wish I'd Known All Along\\" is another great showcase for Howe, sounding alternatively jazzy and almost like Renaissance music. The musicianship is the kind of stellar display one expects from Howe, and he's unleashed here as he is on no other song in Asia's catalogue.    \\"Shadow of a Doubt\\" sounds like it would have been at home on Alpha - it's very catchy and melodic, and I can see myself listening to it time and time again (pun intended). I know a lot of people knock Alpha as too disjointed and not proggy enough, but it has always been among my favorites.    \\"Alibis\\" is an enjoyable enough tune, but listen to the instrumental outro. It's Howe again, providing what sounds very much like a Renaissance-era sequel to \\"Wurm\\" off \\"Starship Trooper.\\" Like \\"Over and Over,\\" it has elements of late-'70s Yes music to it, mingled with a lightness and airiness that would have fit in well on Alpha.    \\"Heroine\\" is a phenomenal ballad by Wetton very much along the lines of his solo tune \\"Arkangel\\" from the album of the same title. I loved that one, and this is a suitable follow-up. \\"I Will Remember You\\" is another stellar ballad that sounds like something from the recent Icon era.    I think Wetton's voice shines most on \\"Orchard of Mines,\\" a brooding, almost melancholy cut that's among the most engaging on the album.    The album also includes two intriguing triplets that are more progressive than most of what Asia has produced before. My favorite of the two is anchored by \\"Parallel Worlds,\\" a haunting tune that leads into two instrumental passages that provide the kind of textural variety that I haven't seen on any other Asia album.    The closer, \\"An Extraordinary Life,\\" is melodic and anthemic at the same time, another highlight. It reminds me of the upbeat final track on \\"Alpha\\" - \\"Open Your Eyes\\" (one of my favorite Asia tracks of all time).Though not quite in the same class, it's definitely close.

0380973642|3.0|This was what most anthologies are. A mixture of hit and miss. The short stories were generally quite good (with a few exceptions) and the poems were universally bland and uninteresting to me.     If you are a professional writer, and you are going to write poems, at least have them conform to some stylistic convention. They can't be the kind of thing that you find in the diary of every emo kid from SoCal to Michigan.    Buy it if you like his work, avoid it if you don't. The only exceptional story in this collection is Murder Mysteries, which is worthwhile to everyone. But reading the whole thing for thirty pages of value is...short-sighted. There are a lot of books in the world.    Harkius
055357342X|5.0|What do I mean by mainstream? I suppose you could also define it \\"literary fantasy.\\" What drives all of George R.R. Martin's magnificent segments in his epic are the characters and how they develop across this colorful tapestry of war, greed, lust -- all the standard themes of truly great literature. He handles it oh-so-well and without a doubt Books 1-3 of A Song of Ice and Fire are among my favorites, at least the equal of The Lord of the Rings (Tolkien) and my new favorite Derek Armstrong's Song of Montségur trilogy (although so far I've only read/reviewed the first book The Last Troubdour.)[[ASIN:B000GT49A2 The Last of the Troubadours, Carl Michael Bellman (1740-1795)]], although I'm about to order book 2, The Last Quest.[[ASIN:1601640110 The Last Quest: Song of Montsegur]] A fantastic journey, and I would recommend this to anyone over the age of 14 (after all it is a lusty, violent tale). This is one book you almost want to read on your Kindle or E-Ink reader simply due to the sheer weight of paper, even in the mass paperback, but I'd take it anyway I can get it. Just for the record, the first book in the series (separately reviewed) is actually my top favorite in this series. [[ASIN:0553381687 A Game of Thrones (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 1)]]
B00006RCOB|5.0|I've always wanted to buy this dvd, ever since I read the novel and saw the movie on t.v., I've search for this dvd and I found it on amazon.com. It's a good movie, with flawed characters, but despite this he made it, and the amazing dogfight with the other firefox, it just blew my mind away, eastwood is great!
0553381687|5.0|A Game of Thrones remains my standard ruler against which I measure modern fantasy, because Martin did everything just right for me. I love complex characters, and Martin delivers a dizzying cast of characters, each complex and changing and interesting. I love the world, premise and story, but really what A Game of Thrones comes down to is a classic battle for power between grasping, greedy characters (no, not all of them, but it's a driving theme). The female characters are strong, which is important to me, although not as well defined as some of the male leads, at least in the first book. The first book in the series remains my favorite thought for a lot of reasons. I recommend this to anyone who loves epic fiction of any genre. The characters are well enough developed to appeal to any reader of popular fiction in any genre. This reads like a well-developed historical epic, set against a fantasy world, and that's how I really like it. The only books in a quasi-fantasy mode that I think compare are James Michener epics (they're historical fantasy, albeit well-researched), especially Hawaii, [[ASIN:0375760377 Hawaii: A Novel]]and my latest favorite (because I love history, medieval knights and chivalry and Tarot cards), The Last Troubadour from Armstrong.[[ASIN:1601640102 The Last Troubadour: Song of Montsegur]] This is not Terry Brooks style fantasy (which I also enjoy). George R.R. Martin takes great delight in killing off main characters and is gritty and real, where a lot of fantasists can't seem to bear to hurt their main characters. Maybe this is what gives it the gritty human quality that makes the entire series of A Song of Ice and Fire so classic.

055358202X|4.0|I never thought I'd write a four-star review of my favorite fantasist George R.R. Martin. I know he was compelled to split his fourth book in two, and I think that might be why this didn't sing for me the way the rest of A Song of Ice and Fire did for me. (See my reviews of A Game of Thrones and A Storm of Swords)[[ASIN:0553381687 A Game of Thrones (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 1)]][[ASIN:B000QV1MAU STORM OF SWORDS (SONG OF ICE AND FIRE, NO 3)]]. Still, I enjoyed it. The characters driving this story were not the ones we've come to love and hate, at least not the main ones, and I think that makes this only a little weaker. On its own merits, I'd still recommend it, but compared to the first three books, it just isn't quite there for me. A lot to like, not much to love. The characters are still rich and deep, but they're just not as interesting as the bigger characters that seemed to be \\"squeezed out\\" in this fourth installment. A lot of interesting side-stories, but the bigger picture isn't quite as vivid. I still recommend it to anyone over the age of fourteen, assuming you've read books 1 through 3.
B000I2J2X6|4.0|This may well be the best of the Harry Potter series and it looks and sounds great in HD-DVD. Alfonso Cuaron has brought his own visual flair and style to J.K. Rowling's tale and it is the better for it. Even the performances of Radcliffe and Watson are better.  Plus we have the great Gary Oldman as the prisoner of the title with Michael Gambon replacing the late Richard Harris as the wily Professor. If you want to really to show off the benefits of this great format (HD), put this on and show it to your friends.

B000NVL9KG|2.0|This review focuses purely on whether or not this remastered version is worth buying.  I rate the sound quality a 2.  In short because thats what it was.  This remaster was less than I expected but it beat the previously issued gold disk hands down.  The problem is that when you juxtipose it against a fresh vinly with Hirsh boost recorded on a CD it's not even in the same category.  Start pressing the albums again for all ELP productions.  Dont waste time re-reissuing cause the original master tapes are juiced out.  Stop exposing them to air and reel to reel machines.  It's over. Press more vinyl and burn it to disk.  You can't get better dynamics, definition and crispness.

It taught me so much about life and how different perspectives can turn one situation into a totally new and different situation. I loved reading this book and I am actually reading it for the second time right now!
0312330537|5.0|Author of How to Mediate Like a Pro: 42 Rules for Mediating Disputes and  How to Negotiate Like a Pro: 41 Rules for Resolving Disputes<br /><br />I just got back from a trip to India. Before going, a friend suggested that I read Shantaram. She said it was a little long but well worth it. I read the whole book in a few days and found it a fascinating introduction to Bombay and India. I definitely wanted to find out more. Because it is basically a true story, the characters and places stood out. As I ate lunch in Leopold's, a restaurant featured as the hangout four many of the main characters and probably full of Shantaram readers, I was looking around for signs of anything I had read in the novel. Because the author lived in the shanties of Bombay, he had good insight into the suffering and needs of the local people. He knew how the mafia worked and what was really happening with the politicians. The book also showed how a man can be transformed and can do good in the world.<br /><br />I was sad when I finally finished the book, but I was happy that I was going to India to see it for myself in the near future. Shantaram helped prepare me for my first visit to India. I knew a little what to expect and I was totally fascinated during the whole trip. I can't wait until the movie comes out with Johnny Depp and other great actors.
0375423966|5.0|What a fantastic graphic novel!  If you normally don't read graphic novels (or comic books), don't be afraid, the pictures won't hurt you and the stories are only enhanced by this format.  Buy the box set because the first book will only leave you wanting more.<br /><br />The books are composed of short stories of events in the author's life.  Some of them seem really simple, but they all have an underlying message.  It may be simply pointing out the joy of moment's of rebellion (getting an Iron Maiden poster was a huge deal to this girl!), or much more serious commentary on the imprisonment and execution of family or friends.  Each story is short but each provides a picture into life in Iran in the late 1970s and 1980s.<br /><br />I confess to know nothing about Iran or its history. These books have introduced me to a culture that is both old and new.  A lot of the extreme conservative movement is really quite young as you learn in this book and the stories show you that the people of Iran are like any other.  Marjane wants what any young girl wants these days - freedom to pursue her dreams and self-expression.  It is surprising to find that many Iranians felt this way in the 1970s.  You also start to understand the patriotism that people in Iran have - not necessarily for the tyrants in charge but for the culture that has existed for so long.  It is similar to how many feel today in the U.S. - you can be a patriot despite disagreeing with the policy of the country's leaders.<br /><br />The illustrations are very simple in form but have a great impact. For example, you feel the oppression that beards have when drawn as almost a wall of black bearded chins.  The emotion is conveyed very well in these simple drawings.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anybody, even if new to the idea of graphic novels.  By the way, some of the best literature comes out in this format.

0684803356|5.0|I do not like to give too high merit to anything, be it book, movie, CD, simply because I think the imagination can conjure up things reality cannot deliver on. But I feel a responsibilty to share my thoughts - my true impressions of the book, unbridled by any fear of corruption by doing so.     Maybe it was the John Donne quote, maybe it was the writing style, or maybe it was the incredible, moving story that made me, directly after finishing the book, put it down and think it was one of the greatest things I had ever read. Trying to say WHY would take too long and probably not make much sense to anyone else. But I suppose I owe it to readers to try.    Here is what you need to know. This is a love story, a war story, in a sense, a God story (but not what you probably are thinking). It powerfully, deeply, honestly portrays the human experience, in all its doubting, hating, loving, sorrowing fullness.    Read this book. And give it time, because it starts somewhat slow and may turn current readers, who want all action and want to be told plainly everything (they don't like to think or discover meaning for themselves!) Even if you don't like it, you won't be the worse, and at least you can say you've read one of America's best novels (that I have read).

It had plenty of clarity to me and just plain looked better and was an improvement over my plain DVD version.      The problem is that all the great bonus features are all gone!  I really enjoyed all the bonus materials and it really upset me that they couldn't make this version truly BETTER.
B00005R5G9|5.0|Oh the 80's. I would have to say that my DVD collection is about 75% of the 80's. Mannequin is no different. Comedy, romance, silliness, and a great song performed by Starship; Nothing is going to stop us now.<br /><br />The movie is about Jonathan (Andrew McCarthy) who struggles to find a steady job. Everywhere he goes, he can't seem to keep it. When he saves Mrs. Timpkin (Estelle Getty from the Golden Girls) from certain death, she repays him by giving him a job and a department store she owns called Prince and Company. He goes from stock boy to head of window displays thanks to a Mannequin that comes to life only to him and creates a masterful window display. Prince and Company is about to be taken over by Illustra; the more popular department store run by B.J. Wert. B.J. is trying ot buy out Prince and COmpany but Mrs. Timpkin sees a bright light at the end of the tunnel for her store after people begin to notice the window displays.<br /><br />This mannequin played by the very beautiful Kim Cattrall. She is an Egyptian princess who was reincarnated into the Mannequin that just happened to be put together by Jonathan at a former job of his. The trouble is that only Jonathan can see her. She quickly goes back to a mannequin if anyone comes near. Many of the employees begin to wonder about Jonathan's sanity. Hollywood (Mesach Taylor) could care less but it on Jonathan's side as Mr. Richards (a nerdy James Spader in this one) keeps a close eye on him. Mr. Richard's is upset at Jonathan because he might wreck the sale of Prince and Company and loose his opportunity to get a much higher job from B.J. Richards also enlists the help of the goofy night watchman Felix (Lt. Harris from Police Academy) and his dog Rambo. Enter Jonathan's girlfriend Roxy who takes pictures of Jonathan playing with his dummy as B.J will use them to his advantage.<br /><br />All and all this is a really good movie. Throughout the movie there are laughs at every corner, but spread out. When Jonathan goes to Illustra to save Emmy (Catrall), there's a good number of laughs as Felix and his fellow security guards at Illustra (he gets fired from Prince and Company) try to arrest Jonathan but fumble each time. Hollywood gets the last laugh. The ending is capped with: \\" and they lived happily forever,\\" with a great song to end it: Nothings gonna stop us now by Starship. I wish the music video was inlcuded on the DVD as the DVD is as bare as it can get. It has the widescreen and standard screen format (you know the deal of, this movie was formatted to fit your screen). If you have any worries, I've played it on my LCD and the picture is great.<br /><br />Anyone who loves the 80's movies, music and loves a romantic comedy will not want to miss this one. Kim Cattrall is very beautiful but if you want to see an even younger Kim Cattrall, check out Porky's (another great 80's flick).to save Emmy (Catrall), there's a good number of laughs as Felix and his fellow security guards at Illustra (he gets fired from Prince and Company) try to arrest Jonathan but fumble each time.

B0010YSD7M|4.0|This review will be short and sweet. I really enjoyed Stargate SG-1, \\"Ark of Truth\\". It was really nice to revisit with the Stargate crew and it was also worth the wait for the completion of the Ori Story Arc. There are only two downsides for me to come out of this made for DVD movie. First, I have to wait for the next one. And second, I missed seeing Richard Dean Anderson in the movie. To me, he will always be the rock that Stargate SG-1 was built on. After saying that, it was well worth the money I spent of the DVD.
B000O77SRC|5.0|Forget this being the best Die Hard film of the current four-film series, this is arguably the number one action film ever created.  It is hard to believe this is over 20 years old, but honestly as the saying goes...they just don't make them like they used to.  While the recent \\"Live Free or Die Hard\\" was more than I expected and quite an action blast, it still could not surpass the level of the original, which is a very easy watch even by today's standards.<br /><br />The story and plot are simple, about terrorists taking over the \\"Nakatomi Plaza\\" building, yet amusingly, many films have borrowed this idea dozens of times over (especially B-movies) for an excuse to present some comparable action.  The end results generally have been laughable in comparison to the level of quality that Die Hard has pulled this off with.  This is definelty about tremendous action, but its also about Bruce Willis as \\"John McClane\\" - the hero who can most likely can be found on any list of top movie heroes of all time.  Plus you have Alan Rickman as the movie's main villain \\"Hans Grubber\\" who without a doubt, goes down as one of the best movie villains as well.  On the sidelines is the sympathetic cop played by Reginald Veljohnson (who ironically went on to play a cop on the tv series Family Matters) who grabs your attention along the way with his loyal support of John (and the two never even meet face to face till film's end).  Even the boss' gang of men seemed quite intelligent for the most part, and are not the typical goons you might usually expect from similar movies.  Each man gave McClane a good fight at some point, whether it was guns a'blazing or fist pounding, wall-smashing one on one's.<br /><br />As exceptional as some of the characters are, and the incredible details director John McTiernan makes out of a rather simple plot, its really the action this film offers that keeps us on our toes.  The excitement actually begins sooner than I thought in the film, and I wondered how the remaining almost two hours was going to keep me engaged, but McTiernan pulls it off with action scene after action scene nearly every step of the way.  More than anything else, there is a \\"ton\\" of gunfire throughout the film, and if you have a decent audio system, it actually sounds better than most shootouts in films.  If you are like me and you prefer the more manly approch of raw fist pounding fights, there are not a whole lot, but several that should satisfy with decent intensity (let's just say bodies smash into things often in the fights).  Like explosions?  Oh yes, Die Hard is well known for them.  I can't count how many explosions are shown on a tv commercial for this film.<br /><br />It took me over 20 years to finally watch this film.  I highly doubted Die Hard was gonna live up to today's standards of action, but boy does it by actually making some of today's films feel like they are missing something that this classic has offered.

B000001ELR|3.0|There is no doubt that this album produced some Classic KISS songs. Ones like \\"I LOVE IT LOUD\\" are a good example. However, the way they got there is interesting. Eric \\"Carr\\" is definitely a good Drummer, but they had to fiddle with the Drums in such a way as to Record the Bass drum Down an Elevator Shaft to get the sound they wanted... or so it has come to be known. Gene's penchant for not crediting who played what is a key part of this dilema, since much of the mouthing about Who was great is pure speculation. Wether or not this is heavier is pure opinion, personally I don't think it is KISS, not by any means. The band defined themselves  in the late 70s from the Album ROCK AND ROLL OVER; this was pre-eminently confirmed with the unplugged Floor being decorated with the Iconic ROCK AND ROLL OVER album cover. What KISS in that era  did was unequaled and unique, it was not pop, it was not hard rock, and it was not metal, yet it encompassed all of these things. CREATURES is a key album in many ways since the presence or absence of Ace Frehley is so heavily significant to so many people, and I think he helped define the core of KISS. CREATURES has some KISS components, but it is connected to some material that is not KISS by any means, and I don't pretend to opine that material, since it is non-KISS, just that KISS went on a hiatus with material like this.
0765357151|5.0|It's funny that our hero is blond and blue eyed while the movie has a black man.  Really good story though.  I hesitated to read it because I'm not into zombies or vampires but this was surprisingly good and not what I expected.  A good story of survival.<br /><br />8-1-10:  After actually seeing the newest version of this movie with Will Smith a couple of months ago, I was blown away.  I have gained respect for Will Smith as an actor!  I have now seen all three versions of this movie and I believe this one is better than Charleton Heston's Omega Man.  Of course, they always change the endings.  I expect they'll do another version in 20 years.  Thank goodness, the book remains the same.  Without ruining the ending I can only say it has to do with evolution and human DNA.

I would like to add I had problem getting this order - NO it was not Amazons fault, at least I don't believe so; but Amazon took responsibility and sent me a whole other order, without cost to me, and even paid for an upgrade in the shipping for the whole order which included the classic Wizard Of Oz.

B0012OQZWA|5.0|This is just a terrific album.  I would be surprised if a better death metal album is released this year.  While fast & technical, the songs have nuances which make them interesting.  It needs to be listened to closely as there is a lot going on (I think the vocals & bass get lost sometimes),  but it's worth it.  A real accomplishment & a real treat!
B0014BECF8|3.0|This is a decent-enough collection, and the sound quality is good, but purchasers should know that the version of \\"Heal The Pain\\" included here is not the original studio track but an ill-advised duet with Paul McCartney. The liner notes also are non-existent. So, I would have given this 4 stars, but I've docked it an extra notch for lousy -- and deceptive -- packaging. Buyer beware!
0307387178|5.0|As I read this book I had a lot of mixed feelings. As a parent I could not have imagined the pain his parents felt for having lost him. Both through his disappearance and death. As a man I was envious of his sense of adventure and his fortitude. As a person who lives on the edge of wilderness in rural Utah I was angered that he would take such risks (although remebering my own misadventures that could have been as fatal).    I wished that he would have properly prepared the moose meat which would have bought him plenty of time, I wished he had done a proper recon of the area so that he new what his rescources were and what his way out could have been. I wished he would have spent some time in Healy and talked to the locals and HEEDED their advice. I wished he would have lived and made peace with his family!!! An excellant book. I hung on every word.
0312330537|4.0|Well, I'm only about a third of the way through this book, but, so far, I am finding it equally fascinating, and annoying.  Fascinating, because of the author's meticulous attention to detail, in his every description of life in Bombay, and its people; and annoying, because the author uses way, way, WAY too many commas, and it's an irritating distraction, that his editors are to blame for not having corrected.  Don't you agree?  I admit that this quasi-review is a bit flip, but for those grammarians out there, please be warned that the extreme overuse of punctuation nearly outweighs one's enjoyment of the story itself and the pleasure of learning about India.  Enough said!

Then I gave 5 or 6 spins, and it gets better. It is much slower, as someone sad, but it's expected from guys at their age and I don't have a problem with that. It has some weak and cliche moments that bother me a little bit. The opening \\"Never Again\\" is recorded in that \\"bigger than life\\" style and it's just the same old riff that sounds a bit to dull, and \\"Heroin\\" suffers from same problem, big ballad that just sounds to cliche and dull. \\"Sleeping Giant\\", \\"Vortex\\" and \\"Deya\\" are in my opinion a bit to pompus and just failing to recreate the sound and feeling of 70's Yes (which is what they were triving for, I guess). It's just that the production is different now, and the times changed also, and to me those parts somehow just don't fit the album right. The rest of the album is actually good. \\"Wish I'd Known All Along\\" is best tune on the album and I wish Steve Howe got more space as writter. Wetton was always a good singer and writer, and \\"An Extraordinary Life\\" and \\"I Will Remember You\\" are real fine pop tunes. I think that Asia is in the place now where they feel comfortable writing just good pop songs, and there's nothing wrong with it. Generally to me it's a 3 1/2 star record, but since Wetton found his Muse in my country and just 100 miles from my town (in Trogir, Croatia, as stated in his notes), I have to give it 4 stars.
B000F7CMRM|3.0|I won't rehash the points already made here. I just want to make the following points:    - Wahhabist fundamentalism (the ideology followed by Al Quida) was created around 1750, long, long before there were any U.S. oil companies.    - The Muslim Brotherhood was created in the 1920s and also pre-dates oil exploitation in Saudi Arabia. The core of the Muslim Brotherhood's ideology is cultural, and anti-western, not economic. The founder of the brotherhood rejected almost all western norms. It was not about oil or economics.     - The 9/11 hijackers and most Islamic terrorists were not inpoverished young men, but rather, rich, well-off students who had every advantage and then some in life. The movie depicts them as exploited, which is very, very far from the truth.     - The real reason why the Arab economies are so backward (the Finnish company Nokia creates more wealth every year than the ENTIRE Arab world, if you exclude oil production !) is not because the U.S. oil companies want it that way, but rather, because the Arab followed the SOVIET model for so many years. By the way, that is the same reason why India remained so economically backward until about 1990 too, and you can't blame oil on that. The movie suggests that the reason why the Arab world is backward economically is due to U.S. exploitation, but the real reason is due to the Soviet model that was followed, of national ownership of assets, and state socialism.     - The movie shows the CIA blowing up a reform Arab politician. This is more than ridiculous and makes the movie ridiculous and almost unwatchable in my view. The CIA might be many things, but they don't blow up moderate Arab reformers, just because a big oil company wants them to.
B00132D808|5.0|My introduction to the group was \\"Nine in the Afternoon\\" which I really identified with, so I bought the CD and it is still fresh and uplifting!
B0010X73ZG|3.0|The Good: Awesome (and I do no use that term lightly) special effects. The monsters in this film were designed by the great Bernie Wrightson, and they are terrifying, diverse and original. The effects were created with a combination of CGI AND models using stop-action animation, and they are really jaw-dropping. This combo of techniques raises the effects above the weightless CGI clutter seen in most films. This is one of the few films about which I can honestly say is worth watching for the special effects and the monsters.<br /><br />The Bad: All the bad that is inherent in Stephen King's novels - meaning cardboard characters and glaringly writerly dialogue; all which serve as a platform Mr. King's childish politics. The characters always feel like \\"types\\" and the dialogue he gives them always feels like sudden speeches out of the blue. Nothing ever, ever feels real or natural. With King, folks are very bad (meaning conservative or religious) or very good (meaning liberal and vaguely undeclared religiously). His heroes are always full of jibes and speeches contemptuous of politics, the \\"govment,\\" and any remotely organized religion. His villains are always quoting the Bible (usually from the Book of Revelations), work for the United States Government/Military, or are intolerant rural (always rural) racists. He also likes to throw in a \\"strong, independent woman\\", usually middle aged, completely non-sexual, with a heavy, Maine/northeastern accent, in every novel for good measure.<br /><br />The Ugly: Without giving up the end, suffice to say it is an ending done by a filmmaker determined at any cost to have a shocking ending. I dislike a tacked-on happy ending as much as the next person, and so much of king is soaked in sugar, but this film's conclusion is ugly just for the sake of ugliness.So ugly, in fact, it left me wondering if perhaps the filmmaker was telling us the \\"crazy\\" zealot was right all along: perhaps the mist really is a God wrought punishment, and God really is the vengeful Old Testament God, pointing his bloody finger at, well, who exactly? The brave and the liberal? A confused, cheap-shot ending, to say the least.<br /><br />Recommended for the monsters (who seem better scripted than the humans) and nothing else. --Mykal Banta<br /><br />Post-script: It seems the near fatal auto accident that Mr. King suffered seems to have completely upset him in some troublesome ways. The author now finds it perfectly acceptable to have his \\"good guys\\" shoot those characters he doesn't like in the face, at close range, in cold blood. There is, of course, the obligitory explainations of \\"having no choice,\\" but this is nonsense. None of Stephen King's heros seems to understand the concept of a warning or wounding shot, which in the situation depicted in the film would have had devastating effect. Perhaps this was a filmmaker's addition, but none the less, post-accident King seems to revel in ugly brutality in ways pre-accident King would not have.

B000002HRE|3.0|Well since the kind of music I like basically died in the 80's I am really starved for good music and got desperate enough to buy some songs off reload.  Now Load sucks except for king nothing and maybe another song.  ReLoad does not suck as much.  Fuel, and 2 other songs are o.k. everything else is FILLER.  It is not good at all.  And Fixxxer is just slow and boring for 8 mins.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|Great great great independent film! This award-winning movie inspired me in a way that no movie has in a very long time. I highly recommend this film (and it's amazing soundtrack!!)
B000W9DSVW|1.0|This is, without a doubt, the WORST quality blu-ray movie I have seen!! what were they thinking when they did this transfer?  It is hard to see a big difference in this regular DVD and the Blu-ray.     The movies are great. the quality is a real let down. This review is based on the HD quality, not the review of the movie, as it should be on the Blue ray box set listing. Don't waste your money until they do a better job with the quality of the conversion
0312360266|5.0|\\"Zoey Montgomery! Night has chosen thee; thy death will be thy birth. Night calls to thee; hearken to Her sweet voice. Your destiny awaits you at the House of Night!\\"    Zoey lives in a world where vampires have always been known about and now she herself has been marked as a fledgling vampire. To survive the initial change she must move into the House of Night, if not she will die. But she may die anyway sometime in the next four years, some of the students don't survive the change at all.    To make things even stranger, her mark is different from the others, a crescent moon all filled in, not just the outline like normal. That is the mark of an adult vampire not a fledgling. It also appears that the vampire Goddess Nyx has chosen her and gifted her with special abilities beyond that of normal vampires.     But all is not right at the House of Night and it needs to be addressed and taken care of as soon as possible.    This book I liked very much, ended up reading about half of it one night in the store before I bought it. The author's writing flows very nicely off the page and pulled me into the story and left me wanting to get the sequel to it, Betrayed. I will admit that there were a couple of times that Zoey came across as a tiny bit Mary-Sueish but not too badly and not enough to make me want to put the book down. For a mother/daughter pair of writers and this being their first book together it's not too bad.
1585673927|5.0|I am a big P.G. Wodehouse fan.  This series of books is especially fun as each book is easily read and enjoyed. The print size is perfect. Great nighttime reading to relieve the stresses of the modern world.
B0012K1ILW|3.0|I've always admired the fact that Erykah Badu had been a trailblazer creatively.  She did it on Baduizm, again on Mama's Gun, and even broke some new ground Worldwide Underground, but this one is a little over my head.  I think its great that she's experimenting with new sounds and song structures but I buy music to be inspired, enlightened and entertained.  I got a little of the first two but not much of the third. \\"Telephone\\" is gorgeous, deep, moody and evocative. \\"Me\\" is introspective and shows a glimpse of her former pre-Worldwide Underground self (though the ending ruins a totally good vibe). \\"Honey\\" is a good little ditty, but, this time, its the intro she butchers. Even \\"Amerykahn Promise\\", with its early 70s blaxploitation theme is cool, new and inventive in a retrospective futurefunk type of way.  The rest, I hope will grow on me.  I adore Erykah Badu and will continue to be a fan of hers, and hey, as long as she's happy with the album, who the hell am I to judge?  But, if this keeps up, I'll just have to be a fan of hers personally and not musically. I wish I'd bought my favorite songs individually instead of wasting thirteen bucks on the whole cd. My cousin told me I wouldn't like it. So much for not listening to kinfolks!!!
B0014Z4OQG|3.0|Watching this movie on DVD helped a bit with the shaking camera syndrome.  I also had to put the English subtitled on so there is something fixed that I can focus on.    The plot, I get it.  Something attacked New York City, and someone caught it on the camera.  Take the event like a volcano eruption, not much warning (sometimes) then BOOM!  You are later lucky to catch a glimpse of the eruption and a little of the ending.  The camera work is the biggest problem in the movie.  I understand they wanted to make it look like a documentary, but you also have to make it watchable.  If you are trying to make it an \\"art\\" like many of these reviewers are saying, then make the \\"art\\" watchable.  So, we the viewing public can appreciate your \\"art\\".  The Monster worked, and I think the design was pretty good.  The special effects team and the CGI team did a great job (Lucas could use some lessons from these guys) on the destruction of a city.  All the explosions, the army fights, the smokes, the monsters looked great.  The movie got 3 stars from me because of the special effects.  The acting was almost bad.  WOW, was that camera guy annoying, \\"jesus dude, did you see that?\\"  \\"God, what was that?\\"  \\"There's some scary s**t up there\\"... over and over again.  Again, I know... it was shot like a documentary, but still, we have to watch this.  Just a little better thoughts into the script would have been nice.  Overall, I liked the movie.  Just wish they would have made it a documentary by a guy with a steadier hand.
1577314808|4.0|Eckhart Tolle is an amazing spiritual writer, at first hard to understand, but once the book is finished it will change your life forever.  It is well worth the time and effort.  This book is in the format of question and answer and not as detailed as his more recent book A New Earth.  If you want to better your life and impact the future of the world read this book or A New Earth.  This format is easier to read and understand but if you really want the tools to be able to make a change in your life and stop the insanity in this world - make the effort to read A New Earth!  If we do not change our ways and the way we view our lives and the life of this Earth we will all suffer.  Take the time for yourself and for the Earth.
B00005JM02|5.0|The 1st time I saw this movie I was sick with the flu & I ordered it for my son on PPV & he watched it over & over all day long and I really didn't think I'd like it but I did watch it and it was So Cute,and it made me feel  better even with the FLU. I love salt water fish and this just is such a good movie from the young & young at heart...
0452289963|5.0|If you are wondering what life is all about and your purpose in this Universe, read this book.  If you are suffering like most of the people on this planet, worrying and feeling like there has to be more to life, read this book.  If you think mankind has made a mess of the Earth and you want to do something to change that and at the same time make your life more fulfilling, read this book.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I was very impressed with the acting, writing and overall production.  They did a fantastic job of bringing these figures to life and putting many individual historical events into context.  We waited anxiously for each new episode to air on HBO, and I can't wait to watch them again on DVD.
1400064287|3.0|This book has tried hard to emulate \\"The Tipping Point\\" - the authors admit that too - but it falls short of being or bringing the very essence of 'unexpected' that the authors preach. Reading the contents of the book leave very little to chance what you might expect in subsequent chapters.    The book is divided into chapters like simple, credible, unexpected, stories etc. which can sometimes slow you down if the next chapter, say 'credible' does not particularly interest you.      Books like the \\"The Tipping Point\\" or \\"The Blink\\" or \\"Freakonomics\\" do a better job of sticking to the principles described in \\"Made to Stick\\" than the book itself.
B000001GQB|5.0|On these DVDs are the finest performances of Mozart symphonies I have ever seen or heard.  I once lived in Vienna and saw Bohm conduct.  I was impressed with him then, but not as much as I am now.  Karl Bohm is, without question, my favorite conductor of the 20th Century.  I used to be a Toscanini fan, but now, I cannot listen to his work at all, after hearing Bohm.  I also own the Schubert, Brahms and Beethoven symphonies, all of which are equally good.  A very great musician, Karl Bohm, and a superb conductor.
B000Y179KO|3.0|I tried to like this album.  I really, really wanted to like this album.  I'd waited years for it, and got it as soon as I could after it was released.    I have listened to it all the way through at least a dozen times, trying to give it a fair chance.  I think it *sounds* a lot like the Eagles.  The music, the harmonies... it recaptures a lot of their old sound, but I just don't think the lyrics stand up to their older work.    If you compare the best songs on this album to even the least of their earlier hits, I just don't think there's any comparison. I just think that they were trying too hard to sound like the Eagles, and, honestly, I think that they take themselves *way* too seriously on this album.    Some of the songs are just plain silly to me.  On \\"Last Good Time in Town,\\" when they're whispering lyrics like \\"staying at home\\" and \\"turn off the phone,\\" or when Glenn Frey is trying to sound menacing, I guess, when he's singing \\"Somebody's following youuuuuuu,\\" it just sounds silly to me.    The album is decent, and it's reminiscent of the Eagles.  If you're looking for something that's easy to listen to in the background, this will fit the bill.  If you're looking for music that's comparable to classic Eagles music, then this album isn't it.    In fairness... I think any group that breaks up, reunites and puts out a new album nearly 30 years later is not going to put out the same quality of music as their earlier hits.  If the Beatles had survived and reunited years later, it wouldn't have been as good as their old music, because they're not the same people that they were when they were younger.    In the end, I think that if they had cut the album down to one disc, and honed the music on that disc, they would have been better served.  I think quality would have been preferable to quantity in this case.    So it's not bad... but it's much less than what I had hoped for.
B0014DCT06|5.0|OK -- I wasn't a huge JT fan... until I saw him on HBO. (This is the DVD of that HBO telecast.) He is amazing. I have seen this about 25 times, and I expect to watch it another 25.
B00005JPTK|2.0|Way below expectations. Go ahead and rent the movie but do not buy it!Waste of money!
B000WZAE1I|4.0|Neil Gaiman's writing is the main reason why Stardust works as a movie. This movie should of been much more popular than it was in the theatres, but the gay pirate stuff probably scared off most of the US audience. Gaiman's ability to create fascinating and intricate fantasy worlds was put to good use in Stardust. Anybody familiar with his earlier work (the Sandman Graphic Novels, Mirrormask) will love this film. People who have never heard of Neil Gaiman before will be pleasently surprised.
B000002UA5|4.0|This is great early Pink Floyd including  Astronome Dominie and Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun. The set includes both a studio and live discs including Syd Barrett compositions. After listening to these works I understand why Stanley Kubrick originally wanted Pink Floyd to score 2001: A space Odyssey.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|WOW! I cannot even start to capture in words the brilliance that is North and South. It's wonderful and breathtaking and 100% romantic and swoon-worthy! Incredible acting, music, story, setting, costumes, everything. 5 STARS and then some..
B00005JPTK|5.0|I loved the alternate ending; it should have been the theatrical one. The Bob Marley music and references (daughter's name) links the movie to the \\"Legend\\" collection of Marley's reggae hits and enhances the movie's title.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This show has a life of it's own, and if you haven't heard the story - enjoy it, because it's a great one.  I'm new to the browncoat revolution, but that doesn't make me any less ardent.  This show has everything you're looking for:  characters, humor, emotional depth, a great new world to explore and yes, fun new words to say: like \\"shiny\\" and \\"gorram reevers\\".  But alas, this show was mishandled by the network, leaving it adrift and homeless.  That's where the fans came in.  Taking matters into their own hands, the Firefly fans wrote and promoted and spent and worked to get this show back on the air.  Although no network has yet to pick up the show - the fans won one battle that no one even thought was on the table:  a feature film.  Yes, Firefly was the first canceled television show to get it's own wide-released feature film (Serenity) on the big screen.  It's a great story, and I recommend it to everyone!  So join the Browncoats and fight for Serenity!  Or... just enjoy it over the weekend with some popcorn.
1577314808|5.0|I liked this book, I am more a fan of Mr Instability because it helped me by making me laugh hysterically and teach me in the same. I think Mr Tolle trys to empower us spiritualy and look deep within us. Good books!
080701429X|5.0|MAN'S SEARCH FOR MEANING is an incredibly deep and optimistic exploration of the best that man has to offer in the worst of times.  This should especially be read by anyone under the age of 30.  We live in a different world today, but today's generation can benefit from the philosophical gold of yesterday's generation.  Some books transcend their time.  This is one.

0143038419|4.0|A friend gave me this book and I am most of the way through India (and personnally have a long great marriage as well as experience with meditation). Any way, like my friend, I really like this book! I don't think one must be politically correct all the time. Her marriage sucked - she wanted out and left. Her business - no children were involved. She wanted time to evaluate her life. I can relate to that. She was just fortunate to write well enough to get it paid for. But it was a time of pain and growth. This is a personal memoir so of course it is about her and her thoughts! If you don't like memoirs read a novel!
B00004Y6O9|5.0|Van Halen (1978) rocks! It's a hard rock classic, and the best album the band has ever released. It sold over 10 million copies, and introduced the world to Eddie Van Halen's wild guitar pyrotechnics including an unusual guitar playing technique, (fretboard) tapping. Eddie's brother Alex plays the drums and Michael Anthony plays the bass on this album. Last but not least, the charismatic frontman David Lee Roth provides the over-the-top vocals and wild screams.<br /><br />Runnin' With The Devil sets the tone for Van Halen with a killer guitar riff and a demonic scream-sing. The first lines of the first song on Van Halen's first album tell the tale.<br /><br />I live my life like there's no tomorrow<br />And all I got I had to steal<br />Least I don't need to beg or borrow<br />Yes, I'm livin' at a pace that kills<br />Runnin' with the devil<br /><br />The electric and blistering guitar solo Eruption follows and pretty much just blew everybody's mind in 1978. And if that wasn't enough of an entrance, they perfectly nail The Kinks' You Really Got Me with a heavy rocking version that makes the song their own. Classic! Ain't Talkin' Bout Love is another smoking guitar classic that rocks hard and adds more desperation and menace to the works. Right out of the gates with four hard rock classics! Yeah! Jamie's Cryin', Feel Your Love Tonight and Little Dreamer are all rock classics, too, and keep pace with the others here. Atomic Punk and On Fire are solid rockers, and the blues parody Ice Cream Man starts out acoustic before morphing into a wild electric blues free-for-all.<br /><br />If you get any of Van Halen's albums, get this one. A must-have for party rockers, rock guitar fans or anybody who likes to listen to hard rock music while they're runnin' with the devil.
B000BT97AO|5.0|Just received the dvd which came so quickly!   Anyway, I saw this movie when it came out and have seen it again several times, but had to buy it. The movie itself is truly remarkable. Just the visual scenery itself is amazing. I agree, the story could have been better, but I think it's a glorious work of art. I would recommend it to anyone. Personally, it makes me feel like a child again and thats something that puts a smile on my face.
0385338724|4.0|I had this book finished in three nights and thought it was a fun read. I didn't give it 5 stars because it didn't \\"wow\\" me, but still think it is worth reading! Have fun!
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|I can't believe I wasted money purchasing this DVD. The best thing about this movie is that it mercifully ended after 87 painful minutes. (Well, there wasn't \\"really\\" an ending but at least it stopped.) Normally you'd question why a movie was so short at only 87 minutes, but with this movie, that was 88 minutes too long. Now I know why the tv trailers were so secretive and didn't really show anything about this movie.<br /><br />The whole movie is filmed as if shot through a home-handheld videocamera. I can't properly express how ANNOYING that was. The non stop \\"massive\\" camera shake and out of focus shots only make me wish I could get my money back on this piece of garbage. Not only did it ruin the movie, but it just makes you want to launch your refrigerator through your tv. Here's a tip for the producers of this movie - In life and death situations where you're climbing buildings and fighting monsters, the last thing you would do is think to grab the camera and continue filming. What an insult!<br /><br />The only good part in the movie was when the guy that kept filming with the handheld camera and was screaming \\"Rob\\", \\"Rob\\", \\"Rob\\", \\"Rob\\", \\"Rob\\", \\"Rob\\", \\"Rob\\", \\"Rob\\", \\"Rob\\", \\"Rob\\", \\"Rob\\", \\"Rob\\", \\"Rob\\", \\"Rob\\", \\"Rob\\", \\"Rob\\", \\"Rob\\", \\"Rob\\", \\"Rob\\", \\"Rob\\", \\"Rob\\", \\"Rob\\", \\"Rob\\", \\"Rob\\", \\"Rob\\", \\"Rob\\", \\"Rob\\", \\"Rob\\", \\"Rob\\", \\"Rob\\", \\"Rob\\", \\"Rob\\", \\"Rob\\", \\"Rob\\", \\"Rob\\" finally got killed. (Basically the above dialog sums up this entire movie.)<br /><br />I would have given this movie a negative number for the review, but that's not possible. The plot 'could' have been ok, but the movie didn't follow through on the plot. There's an unknown monster that attacks the city, and oh, by the way, the movie ISN'T EVEN ABOUT THAT! None of your questions were answered, everybody apparently (?) dies, you don't know what happened to the monster or the dozens of 'spawned offspring' it created and the filming just stops leaving you feeling completely cheated. Gee, how original.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and avoid this movie like the plague.movie like the plague.
B000002H6C|5.0|Thrash metal legends Metallica created an album that quite nearly captured the essence of 'metal' with the recording of \\"...And Justice for All\\". The sound is heavy, aggressive, and unforgiving. The lyrics are angry, purposeful, comes to right through the medium of James Hetfield, who spews anger and frustration at the listener. The songs are quite long (the shortest being \\"Dyers Eve\\" at 5:14) which is, in my opinion at least, one of the hallmarks of 'proper' metal. The length of the tracks doesn't stick to conventions and is obviously not made for radio or TV, it's made for the listener, the one who buys the records and wants to get into it. Who wants to immerse himself (or indeed herself) into the music, the aggression, the experience.    And the things to immerse oneself in are plentyful. A couple of the best Metallica songs ever are on this recording, and maybe even one of the best metal songs period. I'm of course refering to the magnificent hymn \\"One\\". Wonderful. The riffs throughout the album are solid and have provided all metal guitarists with something to copy and rip off for the past 20 years.    The album is well produced bar a single thing. I think the drums of Lars Ulrich have never sounded better. The guitar sound is just right, both as rythm and as lead. Yet the vocals are just a hint too much in the background. Not much, but a bit.    I may be tainted by experience, seeing that I've been a Metallica fan for almost twenty years now, but I do honestly think that this is one of the best metal albums ever released. Should be on your shelf.

B00005JKNF|5.0|As has been stated by so many reviewers before me, \\"Gosford Park\\" is a wonderfully written, acted, produced, and most importantly directed piece of cinema history. It comprises a truly stellar cast all delivering solid performances in astonishing surroundings. Especially is the effulgence of the great Maggie Smith hard to ignore.    Other reviewers have described the plot in fine detail, so I shant bother you with that. I'll get straight to the important bits: the directing. Robert Altman was, in my opinion, one of only a couple of directors who could have made \\"Gosford Park\\" in a proper way. The character driven story is made believable through his unique style. Especially the dialogue, which bears his trademark clatter, chatter, and ambient noise, really gives the impression that we are in a real, busy household with lots of things to take care of and all the rest of it. You really have to concentrate to hear what they are all saying, and still you're probably going to miss some things. Yet this is what makes the film work so well. It plays on the gossip that drives both the upper and the lower classes. On the rumours, the hearsay, the beliefs.     The writing of course is equally good. Great characters and witty dialogue. I am laughing out loud every time I see this film. It is funny but not ridiculous, it is dramatic, but not shakespearean. It is, in a word, great.
0307394549|5.0|I'm often intimidated the long, difficult recipes that appear in Martha's magazine -- and there ARE a few of those in this book -- but most of these recipes can be made with a reasonable amount of effort.  The focus is on excellent ingredients, thoughtful flavor combinations, and precise instructions.  I've made three of the recipes so far and found them to be simply brilliant!  For example, in the Fruit and Nut Cookies, Martha calls for coarse salt instead of ordinary table salt.  It sounded crazy to me to put coarse salt into cookies, but I gave Martha the benefit of the doubt and used fleur de sel.  WOW.  The little unexpected hits of salt with those lush chunks of dried apricot took those cookies to a new level of Delicious.  Another recipe I made was a chocolate shortbread thumbprint cookie filled with sweetened cream cheese and minced fresh strawberries.  Those were positively mind-blowing and disappeared almost immediately.  This book is well worth its price.
B000WCBPOG|5.0|Excellent musical...my 16 year old daughter and I (65 year old dad) love it. She has really joined the ranks of people who are fans of the Beatles. Also a great value...saved money over the basic edition available elsewhere.
0452289963|5.0|I found Eckhart Tolle's newest book  \\"A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life's Purpose\\" an enlightening read. I really liked chapter 5 \\"The Pain Body\\"  It had never occurred to me that thinking is involuntary, that it is no different then other bodily functions such as circulation or digestion. How true it is that many people are totally lost in their thoughts never present or listening to a word anyone says. In chapter 6 \\"Breaking Free\\" Eckhart Tolle tells us how to break free. I kept thinking to myself (what I have thought so many times before) the only thing that gets in my way is me!    Another book I really enjoyed reading is [[ASIN:1888043180 Being Here: Modern Day Tales of Enlightenment]] by Ariel & Shya Kane. It is a light and delightful book of short stories about 'being' that will keep you entertained and put a smile on your face.
B0009FU0ZQ|5.0|Stone Cold episode and Tom Selleck both excellent.  Three other episodes of Jesse Stone also excellent.  Hope series continues with additional episodes.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I watched this on discovery and fell in love with it. I don't care that this version has the original narrator in it. I read many reviews of people saying they couldn't understand him, but that's not true. He's very easy to understand and an excellent narrator. The blu-ray picture looks amazing on my HDTV. I highly recommend this series, especially if you have kids! It's something the whole family can watch together.
B00160TH66|4.0|I'm enjoying Mike's music for about last 15 years and I think he is one of the best musicians/composers ever existed. The album's music and sound are superb. The only disappointed is that I'd love to hear more new works and half of the album is really \\"Orchestral Tubular Bells 2\\". No doubt Tubular Bells is musical masterpiece, but how many flavors of it can be produced?
B00180R06I|5.0|Director Carl Th. Dreyer's ( [[ASIN:0780022343 The Passion of Joan of Arc (Criterion Collection Spine #62)]]) 1932 film Vampyr is as relevant a silent film (even though there is some talking) as the recent movie [[ASIN:B000X1Z0BU Once]] is a musical. Meaning, in Once when they bust out into song, they're actually musicians so it makes sense and when there are words on the screen in Vampyr it's because a book about vampires is being read.  It works.  The film plays like a black and white photograph come to life.  It is filled with eerie dreamlike atmosphere and scares that hold up even now.  This possibly could be the scariest vampire film rivaling Nosferatu, notably the part when one of the daughters goes from terrified about losing her sole to an evil smile.  Even though it is made a decade after F.W. Murnau's classic [[ASIN:B000VUQ4HW Nosferatu (The Ultimate Two-Disc Edition)]] and one year after Browning's [[ASIN:B000GPIPSS Dracula (75th Anniversary Edition) (Universal Legacy Series)]] this could still be the first movie about vampires.  In Nosferatu and Dracula the story tells of a specific vampire and in Vampyr it is about vampires in general.  Vampires here are shadows we see not a guy without a shadow (very effective and eerie).  They are people who have done wrong while living and are not at rest.  They are companions of Satan and have minions working for them that could look like anyone.  You can see how many countless vampire movies this has influenced, none of which come close to this masterpiece.  I found the concept of the ending reminded me of Guillermo Del Toro's great [[ASIN:B000WSLAUO Pan's Labyrinth [Blu-ray]]] but I won't go into detail.    If your familiar with Criterion or any of their horror releases this should be great and the original dvd could use improving.  I've listed the Criterion features below from their website.

B00003CXDV|5.0|this movie is great. I'm a big tim Allen fan and he doesnt disappoint in this movie. He is his same goofy self. This is not an epic movie that will go down in history but a very fun and entertaining movie to watch from time to time
B000QFCD2W|4.0|Giving you a brief rundown of where I stand, I think the best ones are \\"Abigail,\\" \\"Them,\\" and \\"Conspiracy.\\" I consider \\"Spider's Lullaby,\\" \\"Graveyard,\\" and \\"Abigail II\\" the healthy runner ups.  I have some respect for \\"Fatal Portrait.\\" I didn't much care for \\"The Eye,\\" \\"Voodoo,\\" or \\"Puppet Master.\\" Where Mercyful Fate is concerned, my 2 favorites are \\"In the Shadows\\" and \\"Dead Again.\\" I did like \\"Time.\\" \\"Into the Unknown\\" had its moments. I have respect for \\"Melissa.\\" I thought \\"9\\" was weak with a few good moments. I did not like \\"Don't Break the Oath.\\"<br /><br />Onto the subject at hand, I thought \\"Puppet Master\\" was a sad end to his legacy. I listened to the 2 \\"Force of Evil\\" records. I found them respectable, but I did miss Mr. Diamond's vocals. I was happy when I heard Mr. Diamond had come out of retirement.<br /><br />The first thing you will notice here is that Mr. Diamond's voice no longer has the range it used to. (Sadly, we do age.) But he does the best with what he has, and Ms. Zita does a good job of filling in the notes that Mr. Diamond can no longer reach.<br /><br />Instead of the normal formula, Mr. Diamond gives us something different. A man moves into a house and starts seeing some spooky things. He then meets a ghost, and she tells Mr. Diamond her tragic story. I don't want to give away the ending, but there is an interesting deviation from the \\"Abigail,\\" \\"Conspiracy,\\" \\"Graveyard\\" formula. The strongest point of this record is GREAT SUSPENSE. The ending is gentler. Perhaps Mr. Diamond has mellowed at this point in his life.<br /><br />While I was sad that Mr. Diamond's voice no longer had the range he once had, he did the best with what he had. And Ms. Zita did a GREAT job of helping him. The music of course is still in top shape. (Especially the organ intro!) While Mr. Diamond has made better records, this one is still really great. And if it is his last one, it is a MUCH BETTER end than \\"Puppet Master.\\"
B00006AW2J|5.0|\\"Beggars Banquet\\" was released in 1968 after the largely unloved (and underrated) \\"Her Satanic Majesties Request,\\" and began an unprecedented series of classic albums that helpe define them as The Greatest Rock And Roll Band In The World.<br /><br />\\"Beggars Banquet\\" begins with \\"Sympthy For The Devil,\\" an immortal piece rock music that remains among their most exciting recordings, from its sizzling samba opening to Mick's scintilating vocal performance to a fiery guitar solo provided by Keef.<br /><br />Next up is the beautiful \\"No Expectations,\\" which features Brian Jones playing amazing bottle neck guitar. This is quite possibly the most beautiful song in The Rolling Stones' catalogue, a touching ballad with lovely, amtmospheric lyrics and one of Mick's most genuinely passionate and sincere vocal performances.<br /><br />\\"Dear Doctor\\" is a lyrical tour de force, featuring the sardonic lyrical wit and verbal intercourse that help define the band musically.<br /><br />\\"Jigsaw Puzzle\\" is a lengthly piece in which Mick goes into an indepth analysis of his bandmates as well as Londonites in general. A very rich and atmospheric number that goes down smoothly.<br /><br />\\"Steeet Fighting Man\\" is of course an anthem for disillusioned youths whose only way to rail out against the repressive society is \\"to sing for a rock and roll band.\\" An anthem if there ever was one.<br /><br />\\"Prodigal Son\\" is down and dirty acoustic blues that The Rolling Stones are of course accustomed to. This one is done in a stripped down acoustic manner that marks a change of pace for the group but is nonetheless excellent.<br /><br />\\"Stray Cat Blues\\" is the band at their raunchy best. A tale of underage sex, it's among their most rsique numbers, with a thrilling instrumental climax that underscores the excessively sexual nature of the song perfectly.<br /><br />\\"Factory Girl\\" boaasts Indian influences mixed with traditional folk and country. It's a very nice and mellow acoustic rocker with a classic Mick vocal and atmospheric lyrics.<br /><br />Closing the album is the Mick & Keith collab, \\"Salt Of The Earth,\\" a tribute to the working class. A beautiful song, and one they appropiately revived on October 11, 2001 at The Concert For New York, in honor of the thousands of men and women who lost their lives a month before.<br /><br />\\"Beggars Banquet\\" is a fantastic album that ranks among The Rolling Stones' finest achievements.is the Mick & Keith collab, \\"Salt Of The Earth,\\" a tribute to the working class.

0440237688|5.0|This is, quite possibly, one of the most amazing books I have ever read.  It's a world that could be completely real someday, which alone is frightening enough.  I found it almost impossible to put this book down and would have loved it to be even longer.  But it's tight and emotional and I can't wait to read anything Lois Lowry has written.
B000NDIAWO|5.0|I received the cd very fast; haven't listen to it yet but it appears to be in excellent condition as promised.
B000SNUMFC|5.0|The young and inordinately talented and beautiful Elisabeth ('Lisa') Batiashvili has conquered Europe and is making strong impressions here in the USA. She is an artist to watch and follow as her intelligence and musicality make her an important member of the echelon of important young violinist of the time. In this very beautifully balanced recording the listener is treated to a live performance of the Sibelius Violin Concerto in D Minor, recorded in 2007 in Finlandia Hall, Helsinki, Finland with Sakari Oramo conducting the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra as well as the World premiere recording of Magnus Lindberg's Violin Concerto.<br /><br />Batiashvili's approach to the Sibelius is one of moody atmosphere and she early establishes the plangent themes of the first movement and allows those themes to grow to the point of explosive energy without ever pushing the sound to the point of stridency.  The second movement Adagio glows with a stillness and simplicity rarely heard from other interpreters of this concerto and the final movement Allegro is an incisive interaction with the orchestra.  The performance is a live recording so the balance between the violin and the orchestra favors the soloist.  Batiashvili's phrasing is impeccable and the overall performance contains the drama too often missing from studio recordings.  This is a very fine Sibelius recording.<br /><br />The second work on this solid CD is the Violin Concerto by Magnus Lindberg and is an excellent pairing - two Finnish concerti played by a violinist clearly associated with both Sibelius and Lindberg.  The work is in three unmarked movements and displays all of the lush orchestration and creative idea developments that mark this important composer's works.  Batiashvili brings sumptuous, rich sound to the extended lines and compelling dexterity to the fiendish, rapid sections. Hers is a very dramatic approach that suits Lindberg well. This concerto, in its world premiere recording, is immediately accessible to the listener, but it is also obvious that repeated listenings will uncover many of the fleeting, beautiful lines he has written for both the soloist and orchestra.  For now, the concerto belongs to Batiashvili.  Oramo offers strong collaboration form a lushly recorded studio setting of this mighty score. For those who love the Sibelius concerto this is a recording to cherish - enhanced by the introduction to yet another great violin concerto by Lindberg. Grady Harp, April 08listener, but it is also obvious that repeated listenings will uncover many of the fleeting, beautiful lines he has written for both the soloist and orchestra.

B0001WTVUW|4.0|I saw this movie again on the Sci-fi channel last night. It depicts a time that seems so unreal in retrospect. If you would have told me in 1983 that the world we lived in would be free of the spector of mass nuclear war, I would not have believed it. At the time, myself and I am sure, most everyone assumed that the Soviet Union would always be here and that some day events would spiral out of control to doom us all. I am thankfull that history has evolved in a way that removed the threat from our lives. But at the time, the subject matter of this movie was very plausable and very frightening.    In 1982, I was in the Air Force stationed at Whiteman Airforce Base. It was then the headquarters of the 1st Missle Wing, 150 Minutemen missles controlled by 15 buried launch control facilities. It was my mission to maintain single channel satellite emergency action message links in  those  buried launch control facilities. These \\"EAM\\" channels were constantly tested but never used since thier sole purpose was to transmit launch commands from the President or surviving \\"Looking Glass\\" airborne command post. I spent much time in those buried \\"vaults\\" with the 8' thick steel walls. So, the sceens depicting the Oscar facility, really hit close to home. I remembered being 4 stories undergound during exercises many times. These execises could not be distinguished from a real launch sequence, even by the Capsule Jocks. They would close the vault door and instruct us to stop our work and sit quietly on the floor. Sometime the exercise would go on for a couple of minutes, other times it would go on for 10 to 15 minutes. A couple of times, I was sure that it was the real thing and that we were all goners. Thank god it never turned out that way.
0399226907|5.0|My kids have loved this book for years!  The board book is sturdy, even with the short pages in the middle.  The colorful illustrations entice babies & preschoolers alike. It teaches them how to count as well as learning a great story about the development of a caterpillar to a butterfly!  A classic MUST-HAVE book!
B00133KHCO|3.0|I watched this movie with my family a few weeks ago, and as a music lover I found it to be entertaining in that respect. Overall I found it hard to suspend disbelief enough to really enjoy this movie. The story is WAY out there, so I took solace in the amazing soundtrack that Kaki King contributed to (the guitarist behind August's unique style).<br /><br />This movie was made ridiculous in my mind (after all the previous cheese) when visually the piano keys went up in 3rds, and the notes played went down in steps. It was only a second, but it was up close and as a pianist I definitely took notice and it was hard to overlook. \\"C'MON, SERIOUSLY?!\\"<br /><br />Despite everything, it's a movie I haven't been able to get out of my head since, and I'd love for my kids to watch it someday.  (Hopefully the fact that it's on HD DVD won't deter them!)
0316067598|5.0|First off, I am not a reader. I would much rather go see a movie than read a book. This book is amazing and I cannot put it down. It was recommended to me by a friend and I am sure glad he told me about it. GREAT STORY!

B0014Z4OQG|2.0|First of all this movie was made in 34 days (Watch 'The Making of Cloverfield' on DVD and you will see what I'm talking about, but I can slide that thru, since most of it was special effects. Second of all people didn't really like it for several reasons:  1) TOO SHORT  2) NOT BLODDY ENOUGH  3) HANDHELD CAME VIEW    The only reason that I somewhat like this movie is because:  1) VERY NICE SPECIAL EFFECTS  2) LIKE THE MONSTER  3) LIKE THE LOCATION    This is to the people who made 'Cloverfield'  If you're going to make a sequel, please concider these several things:  1) MAKE IT AT LEAST 1hr50min  2) WE WANT TO SEE MORE BLODDY SCENES  3) PLEASE NO HANDHELD CAMERA VIEW  4) MAKE THE MOVIE LOCATION IN A POPULAR LOCATION like (Los Angeles, London, ect.)
0805079831|5.0|An outstanding piece of analysis. Well researched. If one want to really understand why \\"there were no mistakes\\" once the US illegally invaded and occupied Iraq, then read this book.  The destruction of the Iraqi state, the  trauma  and destruction served on the the Iraq society was the plan not a mistake.  Klein provides the theoretical, political, and practical  underpinning for what happened in Iraq, the Palestinian territories, Chile and many other places.     A real milestone work
B0013FBS20|2.0|Can't vouch for the quality of the blu-ray but this movie was really underwhelming. The only good parts of the movie were done before and MUCH better in 28 Days Later and Castaway. I Am Legend is merely a shallow Will Smith vehicle that reaches for something but never reaches anything more than an unsatisfying and bad way to spend a couple hours.
B000MCIBE8|2.0|Maybe I'm missing something, but in comparing the new mixes with the '99 masters, I'm really disappointed.  The first thing is that the volume, and thus the signal-to-noise ratio, is considerably lower than the older ones. That is just plain bizarre. Usually, a new mastering allows for a higher bitrate and a \\"larger\\" sound without any increase in distortion. That's the way it SHOULD be, anyway. So what happened here ? Further, all of the flourishes and oddities may just take some getting use to, but generally with great bands like The Doors, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.    I'm not writing these new mixes off, just pointing out some unusual and, to me, problematic issues upon initial listening. I can say that when these records were originally released back in the day, I had no such problem. They jumped right off my turntable and blew my mind instantly. But, hey, that's just me.
B0010358CQ|2.0|this movie sucks bad enough to be laughable. some one else reviewed it and said it it's like watching a video game cut scene. and there right.it's like... actualy it's like a crappy john woo movie (thats not to say the all suck i actually like hardboiled.)
B000ULQV0W|3.0|I enjoyed the soundtrack a lot.  However, after listening to it through a bit I found the short length to be an issue for me.  Not only the overall length of the cd, but the short songs as well.  Its still very good to listen to, but now I wish I just bought the few individual songs which are longer than 2 minutes instead of the whole thing.  I really do enjoy the music though.
B000EGEVZK|3.0|THE TITLE HERE SAYS IT ALL. I HAD TO SIT THROUGH LOTS OF GRAINY, FUZZY FOOTAGE AND WORSE - SONGS WHERE I COULDN'T EVEN HEAR JOEY'S VOCALS. YES THERE IS SOME DECENT FOOTAGE BUT OVERALL A LOT OF THE SAME STUFF/POOR QUALITY.
B000YABYLA|2.0|This movie depressed me, for the most unexpected reason:  The critic-intelligensia and their corresponding tweeds gushed unanimous praise onto this movie, and I expect so much better from the mass of them.  The only negative reviews I could find of this film (and I was desperate to find them, to validate my dismay) were of the sadly jocular kind found here that might anyway discount the whole range of serious cinema that aspires past instant gratification.  The great irony of Juno is that it actually comes from that place, of pathological self-absorption and intoxication, when it is so easily mistaken for a drama with insightful truths.  There is no truth in Juno, starting with the billboard-sized dialogue penned by its hyped-up screenwriter Diablo Cody.  Who could have imagined that the very critical mass who would properly picket \\"adult entertainment\\" clubs, became so enamored of Mistress Cody's prior career as a stripper?  She has publicly boasted of the experience, and her career is unrepentantly built on it.  (Her \\"big break\\" was her creation of a sex blog called The Pussy Ranch.)  This purports to add chic quirk to her universe, when the truth behind the pole is that nothing but tackiness and creep go along with it.  Certainly, what it does not bespeak is an understanding of reality.<br /><br />And that's the whole problem with Juno, from its ridiculous dialogue to its defiant gloss over teenage pregnancy -- an event that, in real life, imposes epic emotions and consequences without exception, excepting this one big-Hollywood financed faux-independent film.  Juno is as sophisticated as a strip club wafting the scents of Budweiser and Marlboro, or in another sense, as accessibly fake as a visit to Urban Outfitters.  It is once again terribly revealing that another year went by, and the Oscar went to Juno in such a vital category as Original Screenplay.  Naturally.
B001437DMA|5.0|This is another incredible release from Joe. The feel of his music is mostly not the same as it was 20 years ago, but it still has the magic that raises your spirit and engages you. I have zero musical ability, so the technical aspects of his playing are beyond me; what I love about his music is that there's so much there if you just pay attention. Subtle details of sounds that make it real. It's possibly easier for me to enjoy the magic because I have no musical knowledge to analyze it with - I'm free to just enjoy it. He brings life and energy to his music.
B0014Z4OQG|2.0|I purchased this dvd not really having researched the story. I just found the commercials interesting, especially when the Statue of Liberty's head came rolling down the street. What a disappointment! There is almost no story, there is no explanation about how the monster got to New York or what it is, there is no closure. One of the previous reviewers made mention of this film's similarity to \\"The Blair Witch Project\\" and I agree. It is an interesting idea to have the film made from the point of view of the protagonists but I find it hard to believe that anyone would hold on to a camera when faced with some of the dangers shown here. That, paired with the frustrating lack of picture quality and pure lack of information in the \\"video\\" makes this dvd a study in patience to watch. I was shocked to find that the film only runs 88 minutes... it seemed much longer. I can see some people enjoying the \\"novel\\" quality of this film (even though this idea has been done before) but rent before you buy. I didn't and I'm sorry. I have a watched-once copy of this film if anyone wants to buy it.
0060899220|4.0|i picked this up after becoming addicted to bourdain's travel channel show -- no reservations. this book is what jettisoned the previously unknown NYC chef into the spotlight.  as with his show, the appeal here extends way beyond cooking. i for one have little to no interest in cooking (though bourdaine's take on it is fascinating). to me, bourdain is a great writer and countercultural commentator who happens to be a chef. imagine a mix of hunter thompson & keith richards with a chef's background and you have bourdaine. it's all here -- drugs, sex, horrible bosses, new york city sleaze.  intelligent, insightful, hilariously funny, well-written, scathingly honest, this is a wonderful book.

Without missing a step, \\"Lirael\\" follows in \\"Sabriel\\"'s footsteps, with the same dark blend of humor and horror.<br /><br />Lirael is a daughter of the Clayr, but she won't be a full Clayr until she gains the Sight. On her fourteenth birthday, she is the oldest girl to not yet have gained the Sight.<br /><br />After contemplating suicide, Lirael is assigned to work in the library, and inadvertently sets loose a hideous Free Magic creature. Desperate to deal with her mistake, Lirael calls up the Disreputable Dog (somehow made both of Free and Charter Magic), and soon finds ancient birthrights and buried secrets in the Clayr's citadel. And before she knows it, she's being sent off to deal with a rising evil in the Old Kingdom...<br /><br />Elsewhere, Sabriel's teenage son Sameth has his final day of school disrupted by a swarm of Dead, and a mysterious necromancer who is attempting to enslave him (but nabs his best friend Nick instead). After months of ever-growing fear and confusion, Sameth sets out in secret to accompany Nick to the Old Kingdom -- but he finds that he's in far more danger outside the castle walls...<br /><br />\\"Lirael\\" is somewhat different from Garth Nix's first Abhorsen book, in that it takes a long time to wind up to the action. Instead, he takes the time to explore the rich world of modern/high fantasy that he's conjured, and spins up an increasingly complex plot with everything from endangered immigrants to a masked necromancer of mysterious origins.<br /><br />And Nix spins a truly exquisite little world in here -- we have glacial citadels, medieval castles and British boarding schools, full of ice, shadows, malignant creatures and dark forests. And there's plenty of gruesome content -- rotting bodies, the Book of the Dead, or the secret plot of the evil necromancer. Yet he never forgets to include little moments of humor, such as the magic-animals' frequent snippy remarks, Nick's flaky missives, or Sameth's schoolmates singing their school song during an attack from the military and Dead.<br /><br />And old favorites return -- we have thirtysomething Touchstone and Sabriel, as well as a cameo by the dangerous kitty Mogget. And while they often seem rather overburdened with angst, Nix handles Lirael and Sameth well -- one of them is a perpetual outsider who is only just finding her place in the world, and the other is a prince who is literally terrified of what is expected of him. The scenes where he gets panic attacks at the Book of the Dead is well done, and makes the dissatisfied boy seem like more than a bored prince.<br /><br />The Disreputable Dog is a lot like Mogget, in that she's more than she seems and a handy source of info, but not as quietly menacing as Mogget was and is.

B000H0MKO2|4.0|Can a movie be morally reprehensible and wickedly wonderful at the same time? Apparently, yes. \\"Thank You For Smoking'' is hilarious fun. Aaron Eckhart, his star power running full blast, is perfect as tobacco industry lobbyist Nick Naylor. (\\"You know the guy who can pick up any girl? I'm him. On crack.'') And he gets great support from gun lobbyist David Koechner and alcohol lobbyist Maria Bello - as fellow members of the MOD (Merchants of Death) Squad; from the underrated Rob Lowe as a weird Hollywood power broker; and from J.K. Simmons as Eckhart's bug-eyed boss. But something started bothering me about this movie. I probably wouldn't have thought much of it if I hadn't watched a special features interview with director Jason Reitman. Reitman clearly views the anti-smoking movement with contempt. He seems to think that Eckhart's character - who makes big bucks deliberately misleading the public about a product that kills nearly half a million people every year - is no worse and perhaps more admirable than sanctimonious blowhards who want to tell others what to do. The message of the movie seems to be: Don't let anyone tell you what to believe or what to do. Decide for yourself. But is it really so simple when an industry uses bogus research and cutting-edge media manipulation to get people to use a deadly, addictive product? Shouldn't a responsible government do something to counter industry propaganda - even if it doesn't impose the ridiculous skull-and-crossbones label that senator William H. Macy wants to see on every pack of cigarettes? Reitman seems to believe that nothing really matters. You should use whatever skills you have to make as much money as you can and to take care of your family. As Margaret Thatcher put it: \\"Who is society? There is no such thing. There are individual men and women and there are families.'' \\"Thank You For Smoking'' occupies a different moral universe from \\"Michael Clayton,'' a more thoughtful movie (which I happened to see about the same time) that asks us to think about what we do with our lives.
0618918248|5.0|My title really says it all, but a few specifics.<br />This book touches on many things that have been left out of other books about the lack of belief.<br />One is how it is immoral to label Children before they have the chance to think and decide for themselves.<br />The second is the true historical background of religion and, finally, a cross-referencing of many scientific fields in regards to unsubstantiated belief and how it affects us as a thinking animal.
0307237699|5.0|Anyone planning to vote (as everyone eligible to do should), should read this book.  Of the three candidates, Senator Obama comes the closest to helping our country fulfill the many dreams some of us had during the 60's...without the drugs! A thoroughly enlightening book that helped me cut through the political \\"crap\\" and spin put out by politicians...and I am so glad that Senator Obama is not in that mold.    I have voted Republican for the last 15 years and will now vote Democrat, if Obama is their candidate....
B00132D808|4.0|This is an excellent CD. It has great melodies, clever lyrics, and a feel of total integration. Yes, you can hear the influence of giants from the past - this is a GOOD thing. Upon the shoulders of giants comes original musical adventures like this. The negative remarks remind me of those who booed Dylan for having the nerve to plug in his guitar back in the 60's. Great groups move on, and don't collect moss from standing still.
B00005LC1H|5.0|While it is unfortunate that these are all the episodes, they are all hilarious. If you like John Cleese and/or british humor, you'll love this. This also has a good amount of extras, including interviews with Cleese. Highly recommended.
B000W8OM5Y|5.0|Yes, I finally saw Braveheart.  And yes, it is the best darn movie I have ever seen.  The violence is outrageous and the storyline is incredible.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|A FILM THAT MAKES YOU SMILE, CRY AND CHEER. STORY DRIVEN MUSIC AND A BOOK THAT STANDS ON ITS OWN MERIT. A COMBO OF OUTSTANDING TALENT AND MUSIC MAKES FOR A DELIGHTFUL VIEWING. DON'T MISS IT!!!!!
B000N6TYLW|5.0|My sister and I have been waiting for the release of this season FOR AGES! We were not disappointed.  The series is neatly wrapped up in true gilmore girls style!
B00005JPTK|5.0|I am Legend! is an Awesome DVD! The alternate theatrical verson is very unexpected and very thrilling! Its a much see! Enjoy!
B00005N6KG|5.0|Ok, so for $10 you're never going to do better than these. You won't ever feel this set on your head they're so lightweight, and the bass and clear tones coming out of it are amazing. The only issue here: I've gone through 3 of these sony models, and they only last a little over a year with moderate use with the left speaker cutting out permanently. Still, for $10 a year and a half, it's a great buy.
B0012GVKW8|1.0|Let me start off by saying Predator is one of my all time favorite movies. Like other reviewers, the one star is for the Blu-Ray release, not the movie itself. The standard DVD looks better than this! The picture quality on this Blu-Ray is garbage and there are no extras other than a trailer. Don't waste your money on this!
B000VLE3IS|5.0|Arguably one of the best compilations of Led Zeppelin music one could hope for...the DVD is quite good too.  A genuine value for the savvy consumer and a must have for the true Zep fan
B0000DZ3EN|5.0|This is by far the best \\"Return to Oz\\" movie... I actually like this flick better then the origional =D
0385338082|3.0|With the reading of this novel I have at last depleted my supply of Sophie Kinsella books. Make no mistake, this is a tragedy because any novel by this marvelously talented author is just the thing to cheer you up when you're down, or to pass a rainy day with, or read on a plane ride-they're just almost perfect books.    \\"Can you keep a Secret?\\" while it is not, in my opinion in the best of her books (that would be her newest \\"Remember me?\\" and then the Shopaholic series) is still ok, but it will always remain my least favorite of her novels-the plot was just too out there. Based on the idea that a woman spills all her little secrets, just little things really, to a stranger on a plane during a rough flight and then discovers the stranger is her uber boss.  Awkward right?    It is, and funny-though I can imagine the stalker potential written in. But I'll never really believe the ending is plausible.  I'd definitely recommend this book if you're in need of a chick lit fix or a cheerer up. My only complaint about this author is that her books fly by too quickly. A few hours and they're gone.    Three stars.
B00003CXSM|5.0|Awwww, I love this movie. You will definitely laugh through out the movie. J-Lo really does a great job in this movie. Oh and can't forget the handsome Matthew McConaughey! I would recommend this movie to everyone. Even your kids can watch this one!
B000UBMWG4|5.0|I really love this set.  For a blu-ray, 5 disc set, under $30 is a fantastic price.  The set has three movies; the director's cut, the theatrical movie, and a working print.  It also has two extra discs; the making of the movie and a resource disc.  I have seen all the discs except the working print and expect to watch that in the next few days.  The movie speaks for itself.  It is the last great special effects SF movie made without Computer Generated Images.  It is incredible what they were able to do with models (some two dimensional) and lighting.  There is a great deal here on how to make a movie.  The professionals' comments helped me appreciate just how many great innovations it took to take me into that future world.  Also, the resource disc is a valuable treat for Sci-Fi fans.  There is quite a bit on Philip K. Dick including interviews with him, his family, and other SF writers.  Brian Aldiss is one of the interviewees.  Dick's interviews are very interesting with him pulling no punches to save Hollywood's feelings.  For the record though, he was apparently enraptured by the way Ridley Scott captured the world he had visualized in \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep\\".  This is a great presentation and I expect to view it again, and again.
B000001IQH|5.0|I am tired of these reviewers saying that rancid is not punk.  So what?  They never said they were.  They play what they want, and that happens to be music that is punk influenced, ska influenced, hardcore influenced, with many other influences.  Just because someone has a mohawk and has punk influences does not mean that they are screaming to you \\"PLEASE BRAND ME AS A PUNK\\".   With that out of the way, Rancid is one of my top 5 favorite bands and this is one of my top 10 cds that I own (I own over 800 cds on the last count a year ago).  This album has no filler tracks and is awesome in every aspect desired:  lyrically, musically, and energy-wise.  If you have not heard Rancid, this is the album to start with and the other ones are almost as good, too.
1401322336|5.0|I am really enjoying this book. Jamie uses a nice, easy to understand conversational style to describe his recipes and techniques. He makes cooking sound easy (which it is!) and uses mostly easily accessible ingredients. His passion for food shines through every page.  This is a great book for beginners, as well as more experienced home cooks. The recipes work well and definitely inspire to change things up every once in a while.
B00003CXDD|5.0|Great movie, I loved it as a child and I still do as an adult.
B0008ENICU|3.0|The Women is considered a classic and although some parts are funny, this film isn't a winner. Joan Crawford is great as the \\"other woman\\" and Norma Shearer is such a sweet and sensitive actress but othewise than The Women is a letdown. I guess you can call this dramedy anti-feminist but I think this is how real women really act. Love it or hate it, this chick flick deserves a viewing.
B000YIGNKE|5.0|I haven't read the book yet, but this version of Persuasion was amazing. The style of filming and the story was done well: the distance between them is palpable. Masterpiece Theater has done wonders with the revision of the Jane Austen classics. I can't wait to see Sense and Sensibility.
B000ICL3KG|1.0|It's hard for me to believe Al Gore actually believes this stuff and isn't just using this movie to earn a buck. If so, he needs to live by example.     His home uses 12-20 times more energy than the average household (while only 4x the size) - Search snopes.com or truthorfiction.com for \\"al gore energy\\" to find out for yourself. He also uses his private jet (search youtube for al gore jet) which is the most inefficient means of travel. Don't believe the movie when he tries to portray himself using a commercial airline. He only did that for the movie.     I'm sick of lies and hypocritical politicians.    Don't be fooled
B000XTLUW0|5.0|Any Muse fan...or even any fan of great live music will appreciate this live CD/DVD!! They play all the fan favorites, and they even go back and play one of their old songs(Unintended)from their first album! They hardly play any songs from their first album, because Matt's voice has changed, so it's a rare treat that you get to see it played. Go and buy this album, because it's totally worth it...I think it's even better than the other live CD's, but that's just me.
B000WCBPOG|5.0|My Dad really loved the film \\"Across the Universe\\" it seemed a pretty easy and obvious gift to buy him the soundtrack. He loved it +1 me!
1851774394|2.0|This big glossy picture book is a big let down because all it shows is parts and pieces of garments. The details are useless without getting to see the effect on the whole garment. Who needs a book filled with collar and cuff close-ups? If you are looking for great pictures of 19th century dress- This is NOT the book for you!
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|Cloverfield is no doubt the worst movie I've seen in years.  It may appeal to teenagers, but it was total garbage...a total waste of time.  Anyone who can enjoy someone running all over the place with a video camera on his head without getting a splitting headache...well, kudos to you.  Just envision someone shaking a video camera the whole duration of the movie...that's Cloverfield.  I wouldn't even give it one star.
B000000HHE|5.0|\\"3 Feet High and Rising\\", the debut album by underground legends De La Soul, is a monument of creativity and brilliance in old school hip-hop. First off, Prince Paul produced the whole album with a style that's friendly to the ears of those who prefer alternative and/or jazz. It was really refreshing and set up a conscious mood to fit along with the lyrics.<br /><br />The lyrics are another reason why this album is a landmark. De La Soul don't care for stereotypes, and the lyrics deliver a positive message about certain things in life, whether it would be based on love (\\"Eye Know\\") or appearance (\\"Can U Keep A Secret\\" and \\"Take It Off\\"). Even in their conscious message, De La Soul aren't afraid to lighten things up with a bit of humor. \\"Ghetto Thang\\" is the only track that's no so uplifting, being based on poverty and social issues, but it is still given in a way that only De La would give it (they even use limericks). There is even a game show that is \\"played\\" throughout this album, which is played by Posdnous, Trugoy, Maseo, and Prince Paul (the first three being members of the group) and while it may sound a bit dated, it's something that represents the group's style. Let me also tell you that in the song \\"Buddy\\", you get a guest appearance with some other Native Tongues style rap members, the Jungle Brothers and A Tribe Called Quest's Q-Tip, so you get another taste of the first group mentioned and an insight of what ATCQ would be the year following this CD.<br /><br />This CD is fun, it lays off the vulgarity in the majority of the songs, and it was something else back in 1989. Make sure to give this a good listen, because there is nothing like it.
0446607274|4.0|This book took me a long time to get into, but once I did, it seemed to hum right along. The only problem I found was with the personal problems the main character was having. They seemed to be a bleed over from another book, perhaps? You weren't really getting enough of the story for it to be part of this story, so it was annoying and distracting (I understand that the main character has to be somewhat distracted by personal problems, but for goodness sakes, explain them well enough that we understand!). Also, at the end, there was a line that, to me, indicated that the story was not so \\"wrapped up\\" as the author would have you believe. I think there was more to it.... Not in a sequel sort of way, but in a \\"well, there could be more but we're leaving it to your imagination\\" sort of way.

0307265730|5.0|Lahiri's Unaccustomed Earth is spellbounding. Eight short stories woven so tightly together, it would take a great deal of stretching, bending or breaking to get them to unravel.  Lahiri's strength - among many of them as a story teller - lies is the character development of the protagonists, their realities, anxities, dream and behaviour. I first read one of the stories 'Year's End' in the new Yorker a couple of months ago.  It was about a young man's fathers second marriage. I loved it. And, imagine the bonanza with seven more of these wondereful tales.<br /><br />As an Indian, I lived in North America in the 70s and 80s, watching a first generation of immigrants.  Now, I watch their children, the people Lahiri writes about. I see them in the US, in India and in other parts of the world. In them are all the things Lahiri writes about - strength, confusion, conflicts - and torn between the culture they came from and the one they are part of.  She is right on target about them.<br /><br />Reading Lahiri is pure pleasure.  Don't miss the book!
0143038419|3.0|THis book is like going on a three-day weekend with a very chatty girlfriend.  The first two days are fun and interesting; sometimes funny, sometimes insightful.  But, by the third day, you've really heard enough of her talking and start to wonder how much of what she says is really true.
0743496736|5.0|very good book on how everyday life as we know it can change in short amount of time
0312323867|1.0|Partway through I realized this is actually a sequel, and the first book was written from her best friend's perspective.  I think, had I read it first, I may have enjoyed it more.  But I doubt I will now. On the surface, this is another 'Shopaholic'-esque piece of chick-lit.  But the more I thought about it, the more it bothered me.  Of course, you're supposed to dislike the main character at the outset - she's shallow and vain and not at all considerate.  The problem is, I never started liking her, as I think you are supposed to.<br /><br />Part of my problem with this book stems from the 'motherhood miraculously turns people into responsible adults' message. Nothing could be further from the truth.  As much as we'd love to believe that bonding with a child (even while still pregnant) could miraculously turn you into a better person, the reality is that most (and I emphasize the most here) unwanted pregnancies result in unwanted children.  And there's nothing glamorous or romantic about that.  So using that as the basis for a story... well, I didn't like it.  It came across as wholly unbelievable and cheesy.<br /><br />So I disliked the main character (and many of the side characters) and hated the plot... I think you can tell how I'd rate this.  I certainly wouldn't recommend this book to anyone.  There's plenty of great chick-lit out there, I'd suggest giving some of it a try.
160024131X|5.0|This is not a literary masterpiece; it's just a great book.  It was easy for me to imagine I was there and I felt like I lost my friends in this operation.  I will listen to this audio book again.  It would be a privilege to meet Marcus Luttrell.  He, the men lost in this operation, and the other soldiers of this country truly need to be commended.  The book will inspire any true patriot.  Thanks Marcus!
0375701427|5.0|American Pastoral is Philip Roth's meditation on the rise and fall of a certain American dream. The \\"Swede,\\" (Roth's main character)is an athlete, a scholar, and a fine, hard working man who builds a business into a small empire. Finally achieving a sort of American country squire existence, the Swede discovers that his only daughter secretly despises his values. With the help of violent radicals, she blows up the quaint local post office, and succeeds in killing a doctor. The rest of the novel charts the Swede's agony as he attempts to understand this shocking event and its meaning for a man who always believed in the post war promise of a healthy, thriving, American paradise.<br /><br />Donald Gallinger is the author of [[ASIN:1601641591 The Master Planets]]
B0013FBS20|4.0|I was entertained, at the least.. not the greatest movie ever, but makes you wonder if something like that could ever happen.. maybe not turning real people into something like that, but still.. i'd recommend for a viewing.. the Blu-ray transfer is excellent, as is the sound..
1591841984|4.0|1. I like the fact that this is a hardback of a smaller size... saving paper. Its a cool format, and I don't mind the smaller typesetting within.<br /><br />2. This book offers some things here and there for those who already know a great deal about Steve. If you are new to all things Steve, then I think this book glosses over many important background details. It walks a strange line... written sort of for those who already follow, and sort of for new comers. This is why I only offered 4 stars. It tries to be all things to all readers, and that doesn't seem to work here.<br /><br />3. Overall its a very good read, the chapters are succinct and offer some never before revealed tidbits of design decisions, etc.<br /><br />I recommend this book even though its not quite sure who it is trying to cater to.
B00110K62U|5.0|This is a great video you can learn alot about Le Miz by watching the special feature's. If you love this musical I recremend that you buy this video.
B000021YQV|5.0|Seriously, this is an incredible album and System of a Down are a truly unique band that have become the success that they are through creating music like nothing heard before. \\"Nu-Metal\\" is simply a genre label that was created in order to allow other bands with a \\"unique\\" sound to belong to. This is something that System of a Down created, they were a band that stripped away that label of being a rock band and essentially created a genre of their own. Serj Tankian the lead vocalist of the band is an incredible talent of massive proportion, he's not only a songwriter but he's a poet, a visionary and a political critic. He picks out parts of the System that are corrupt and downright criminal and gives us his no holds barred approach to the system. Along with being an utter genius at what he does, I think we can all agree that listening to how some of SOAD's songs are constructed Serj Tankian is possibly a little bit insane (The good kind, not the OJ Simpson kind.)<br /><br />This album is considered by many to be the Systems best album to date and from turning on track 1. Prison Song you come to realise how inventive, talented and intelligent this band really is. This first song simply points out the hypocrisy of the legal system when it comes to drugs, it points out the convenience of drugs being on our streets and less money being spent on treatment and more on prisons when research does show that treatment should receive the most money from the government. It's a brilliant song that shows quite clearly the intelligence and political mind of the band. This is something that should be brought to the mainstream more often and it's a shame that even now bands like this are looked down upon simply because of their sound.<br /><br />Honestly this is an amazing album and for those fans of music in general, who keep an open mind and are quite experimental in their tastes, then I promise you will be pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />My Top 5 Are<br /><br />Prison Song<br />Chop Suey<br />X<br />Deer Dance<br />Needles
B000YABYLA|4.0|I thought this movie was just hilarious. I didn't find it to be this awe inspiring thought provoking flick. I just liked it and found the dialogue and characters to be really hilarious. Ellen Page is great.
006112429X|5.0|In the early part of the text I mentioned to my friend \\"I think Eva's husband is dead--or something--since the entire novel is of letters, no responses.\\" I said this breezingly, not having yet become attached to the characters. Of course, I was right, but when I made the literary discovery, I was attached to Franklin despite his Shakespearean tragic blinders. Celia by then had crept into the corners of my heart and planted and fastened herself in a spot I couldn't pluck her so easily. Reading the ending only made me want to reread the beginning when I was making predictions, characterization charts, and voicing themes, and not reading from the heart. The powerful read has me moping about. I'm sure those reading this could cite hormones (I'm in the prime age), conflicted motherhood (I have three teenagers), just two days ago one of our students committed suicide, so I have a lot of emotions running high, but I want you to ignore those when I say this has been the most powerful but difficult read this year yet. I didn't race through it as I have other texts I've marked as five-star reads. This book took me just about three weeks to complete. Maybe subconsciously I knew the outcome, the same way Franklin might have felt when he saw Kevin pinning his sister or feel the \\"shu-thunk\\" of the piercing lances.
B0014CQNTK|4.0|Parts of this movie are either too real, or completely unreal:  Juno's glib sarcasm firing off with machine gun rapidity (no one is that \\"on\\" all the time), the over-the-top adoptive-mother-to-be (made my skin crawl), the scene where Juno and the adoptive father-to-be started stepping close to some dangerous boundaries, and the too-perfect-to-be-believed-for-an-instant parents.<br /><br />Despite these quibbles, the movie was constantly witty and enjoyable.  The actors sold the stylized parts effortlessly.  The parts that needed to be real succeeded by not having to be sold.<br /><br />Much of this movie's charm lies in the details.  The goofy music that serves as another character in the movie.  The cross country team serving multiple roles (the four seasons, the Greek chorus reminding us of what \\"good kids\\" are supposed to be doing, . . . ). The quirky supporting cast all glue things together.<br /><br />Juno could easily become THE new classic teen tale:  tons of one-liners to memorize, unique characters that bring a story to life, and moments that refuse to be forgotten.  Sure, it's kind of self-assured and too good to be true (not unlike Juno's parents), but it's a fun ride and it's hard not to feel good about how it works out.
0525950079|5.0|After reading Pillars of the Earth by Mr. Follett, I couldn't wait to read this one which continues with the same theme and linked characters...  my friends and family thanked me for sending them copies and said how much they enjoyed both novels.
B00104QSOM|5.0|I am not reviewing the actual DVD. I have heard bad things about packaging and other things. I am reviewing the movie and it was GREAT and the best movie of the year. No Country For Old Men was good and I really liked it but after seeing There Will Be Blood there is no comparison. Daniel Day Lewis is the finest actor of our time.
B000YABYLA|4.0|after all the hype that has been behind this indie film<br />it had no choice but to either knock it out of the park AKA Little Miss Sunshine or completely suck. it didnt really do either for me<br />it had an amazing cast ellen page , michael cera , etc... and the plot was good<br />it just wasnt great<br />def not as great as everyone seems this movie to be.
B000000OXH|3.0|I like Asia, I really do. I'm not so sure I am satisfied with this album from some of the \\"giants\\" playing on this CD. I loved their first recording and I heard a lot of positive talk about this their second album \\"Alpha\\". I ordered a used copy on Amazon for less than a dollar and I am still wandering if I got a deal. I coulsdn't tell if that is Carl Palmer or my cousin on drums and where in the world was Steve Howe (on the telephone?)Most of the songs, while ok, sound as if they were stamped from the same mold and don't offer up much variety. I would rather reccomend their first album \\"Asia\\" or the latest release \\"Phoenix\\". Back to you Paula. - Ciao
B00003CXA6|4.0|The four hour battle of Gettysburg was on the whole very entertaining, well shot with good action.  The story focuses on two viewpoints, that of James Longstreet and Joshua Chamberland and we view the story through their eyes.    Unfortunately, as an historian I saw the vast amount of visual errors in fact which are constantly taking place.  The worst being scenes that are placed in the wrong time sequence for the first day's fighting.  Second was the charge at Little Round Top.  If you have ever been there you know its not that long a slope.  It takes only a couple seconds from the battle line to the saddle between the two Round Tops.  The movie shows this as a long long sloping ground which it is not. And finally did anyone notice the credits?  There are cast members listed who are not shown in the film...cutting room floor I guess.  (I now understand from reading further posts that there was at one time a Collector's Edition Video Tape which has more footage so I guess this is where the missing cast went.)    The storyline is however is essentially correct as there are no errors in fact contained in the spoken dialogue.  Many of the spoken lines are taken directly from first hand accounts of the battle.    But as a Civil War (Gettysburg) story I enjoyed the movie for it places you in the lives of those men who fought there and on the whole is worth seeing despite the technical errors.    Update 28 Aug 2010    If the reader has Internet access the deleted material from the movie can be found on YouTube.  Just search under Gettysburg for deleted scenes.
0740748475|5.0|One of my favorite complete edition. The comics are so well printed and some gems like the postface interview are really valuable.  Must buy.
B000Y7ZHCU|3.0|I have been to the concert twice. It's Great! Maybe that is why I was so disappointed in the DVD. The music is great, the editing is amateurish at best. The video cuts from one angle to another every one to two seconds. Except when it focuses on Celine, then maybe 5 or 6 seconds. All of the majesty of her dancers is lost in the rapid fire scene cuts. You cannot focus on anything. There is a lot going on on-stage. It is definitely not captured well on the DVD. Great singing, fantastic Celine. Poor editing and video production. Too bad.
B0010X73ZG|5.0|When I first read \\"The Mist\\" 20+ years ago, I was struck by how visual the story was.  Unlike many of King's stories, which unfold primarily in the characters' heads, \\"The Mist\\" was just a straight-forward monster story, which would make an excellent movie.<br /><br />\\"The Mist\\" is an excellent movie, with some sequences (ex.  the loading dock, the trip to the pharmacy, etc) being just as I imagined them.  My only complaint is the tacked-on ending.  I highly recommend to stop watching the film where the original story ends.  Those who've read the story will know when this moment comes.<br /><br />I couldn't decide if the subsequent events of the tacked-on ending were meant to be Biblical (essential to the story dramatic tension), \\"O.Henry\\"-style twists or just a reluctance on the filmmaker's part to trust the original ending.  It dragged on so long, I became fearful that it was going to be an \\"It was all a bad dream\\" cop-out ending.  I hope that any \\"special editions\\" of the movie in the future will exise this wholly unnecessary section and give \\"The Mist\\" the original ambivalent ending it deserves.
B0017XD3OY|4.0|not great, not bad, just good. worth the rental fee.  Will Smith is a good actor and carries this movie.
B000000OTY|5.0|I typically find it hard to enjoy a live album if I know the studio versions really well (and vice-versa if I knew the live versions first). But this one is an amazing exception (along with Wilco's 'Kicking Television')!  \\"Secret World\\" and \\"Shaking The Tree\\" are OUTSTANDING! The energy is insane. Paula Cole sang on the Eurpean leg of this tour (damn, I wish she had been with him in Orlando '93). She's just brilliant!  I know some may find this blasphemous, but I prefer her vocals on \\"Don't Give Up\\" over Kate Bush. And that's my .02. Buy this CD!!!!
B0013K6WLM|4.0|This album is much more polished than the Black Keys older stuff. I love their old raw sound. This album is better produced and sounds like it would have wider appeal. They could only take that old formula so far. It's good to hear them trying something new and doing it well.
B000FSME1A|5.0|Whenever filmbuffs compile a list of the best films of the Vietnam era, Apocalypse Now usually ends up between the 1 and 5 placing. Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece, based on the book Heart Of Darkness (even though the book actually doesn't take place in Vietnam, but West Africa), is a startling story of an Army Captain (Martin Sheen) on a secret mission to \\"relieve\\" an AWOL Colonel (Marlon Brando) who has gone powerhungry and mad deep within the jungle of Cambodia, all awhile traveling up the Mekong River with four crewmen, encountering shellshocked soliders and the horrors of the War all around.<br /><br />However, behind the scenes of making this film was a horror all of it's own. Budget problems, cast becoming as insane as their characters, and Coppola, well, trying to \\"cope\\" with it all. Still, for it's time of 1979, the film turned out to be an amazing visual as well as audio expierence (it's actually the first film to be premiered in the then new 5.1 audio sound). But in 2001, Coppola decided to re-edit his film to include more than 49 minutes originally edited out due to time & plot pacing reasons. Thus \\"Apocalypse Now Redux\\" was born.<br /><br />This was the first time I've seen Redux, having seen the original 153 minute numerous times, but at a now whopping 202 minutes the film didn't seem to drag or be filled with unneccesary filler. The new scenes, most notably the encounter with the French family and their rubber plantation still standing tall within the war-torn area, was a plot point understandably cutable, but now gives more insight to the views of the American involvement there. All the newly added footage blended perfectly with the original, and makes Redux worthy of any upgrade.<br /><br />On to the \\"Dossier\\" release itself, it's mighty impressive. Packaged in an classified envelope with a beautifully decorated Digipak inside that holds the two disc set firmly, Dossier also gives you fully remastered versions of both films, but be warned, they have spread the presentation on two discs meaning halfway through either version you are going to have to change discs. Special features are plentiful with hours of footage showing behind the scenes of the making of the film as well as interviews with most of it's stars (minus strangely Martin Sheen & predictably Brando). However, to give this release the title \\"Complete Dossier\\" is somewhat misleading because the 1991 documentary \\"Heart Of Darkness\\" which truly showed the complete process of the film from start to finish was not included in this set. This is a major ommision, somewhat making the hours of doc's given on it sort of lackluster compared to what it would be with a third disc included with \\"Heart\\" on it. Coppola does give an excellent insightful commentary here (for both versions), so it's not a total loss.<br /><br />But does the movie stand the test of time? In my opinion, mostly. After fifteen or so years of Hollywood cheating special effects with CGI, the once amazingly impressive scenes of the beach attack ending with the Napalm bombing, while still visually stunning, now seems commonplace in action film. But younger generations should understand that that scene is actually happening, those are real helicopters in the air and those explosions are really burning, not something most of today's CGI-fests can boast. Another somewhat dated aspect of the film is it's soundtrack score. While the percussion tracks are fitting, the keyboard/Moog based ones seem out-of-place and extremely dated. And an odd choice due to not being a part of the late 60's (it was the mid-70's where it rose in popularity), and today just sounds, well, cheesy. However, it's title track \\"The End\\" by The Doors is a monumental addition, truly showing the landscape culture of the times (also bonus points for the original vulgar lyrics version that at the time hadn't been heard by most of the public). But these aside, the film is a great, yet strangely different view on the Vietnam warthat movies like say Platoon, Full Metal Jacket, and even Forrest Gump don't show. It's really in a league of it's own in that sense.<br /><br />Overall, there's really no Vietnam-era movie quite like it. Though at times it reaches levels of almost black-humor (a surfer-obsessed Lt. Colonel, a decorated solider suddenly becomes a God, and Dennis Hopper as an over-the-top photographer), it still remains as one of most pivotal cinematic points of the 1970's. Even if your not a fan of wartime films, everyone should see this to know just how hard it used to be to show the genre as realistic as possible.ull Metal Jacket, and even Forrest Gump don't show.

0307346617|4.0|Generally I am not a big fan of zombie stories, but I bought this one because I needed something for a long airplane ride and WWZ got good reviews here on Amazon. It starts off slowly, but builds momentum, and the technique of cutting back and forth between various interviews and vignettes is a good one.  Brooks demonstrates his versatility as a writer by creating so many different \\"voices\\" and many of the scenes he creates are vivid and memorable.<br /><br />The book's greatest weakness, IMHO, is that the zombies are never really explained. How do they eat and digest food when half their bodies are blown away? Why don't they decay? How do they survive underwater?  The notion of a zombie pandemic that lasts for years is basically implausible, but if you are willing to ignore that, this is a good disaster novel.<br /><br />Also, you have to wonder about Brooks' political agenda, as other reviewers have noted. In his post-apocalyptic world, the leading economic power is ... CUBA.  Huh? That makes no sense, given that the zombies function best in warmer climates, and can't take cold.<br /><br />Such quibbles aside, WWZ is an entertaining book and worth reading if you like well-written disaster novels with vivid descriptions. My plane ride passed quickly, thanks to the zombies.
B000Q6GUW0|1.0|The best words to describe the show . . . sick, twisted, perverse, and sadistic.  As America's fascination with sadism and death grows, so does our hunger to watch executions and gawk at grizzly car crash victims.  Then, people who flock to \\"art shows\\" full of mutilated corpses and take sadistic pleasure in growing more sympathetic with a serial killer watch their evening news and wonder what's wrong with everyone else and how this world got so sick and twisted.  If you aren't fascinated at the prospect of watching Internet videos of beheadings or snuff films for family entertainment, then you won't like this show either.  Its as though the people who brought this show are conducting an experiment on how desensitized they can make people and how little regard for human life they can instill in the mind numbed TV watching drones of America.  I won't even watch anything on ABC any more.

B001152OW0|5.0|What can I say. McCall Smith is an extraordinarily good writer. Even if you don't go for detective stories, this will captivate you with the descriptions of Botswana and its people. Every one of his books, no matter where they are set, whether in Botswana, Edinburgh or Germany, are absolute gems. It is a pleasure to read a well-written, interesting, funny and informative book, and McCall Smith manages to write them!
B000002UC5|5.0|So much talent in this recording. Coming shortly after the Beatles breakup, this recording showcases what Paul had written for himself. The album crescendos to \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\", which is......amazing!
B00132D808|2.0|I was afraid of this album. After the big success of \\"A Fever You can't Sweat Out\\" I read in an interview with the band that they didn't think the album was that good. As such as they were going to change their formula. As they say, \\"If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\\" Unfortunately, they tried, and they broke it.<br /><br />\\"Nine in the afternoon\\" is catchy albeit odd, though that fits with the album name. The rest is mediocre and bland and nothing you can't live without. Unfortunately, this sounds nothing like the stuff that fans love them for.

B00005JPXY|4.0|First of all, I totally disagree with reviewers who complain that the set-up at the beginning is too long.  In fact, I felt that one of the film's strengths was an excellent sense of timing throughout.  There was just enough footage of the party to give you a basic idea of the relationships between the main characters, and then the action began, driving all of them to the rooftop and from there to the streets.  I put the DVD in just to watch a few minutes before grabbing dinner, and ended up watching it all the way through, and I felt it was tight, edited well, and the pacing was just right.      I also reject the notion that the hand-held camera was too obtrusive or too shaky.  I thought it leant a sense of realism to the movie and I didn't find it to be distracting or even all that noticeable after you watch for a few minutes.      I loved the big action sequences and didn't feel they were overly violent or bloody. The smaller monsters who drop off the big guy were creepy and in a lot ways more scary than the main one.      The unknown or little-known actors did a very good job and unlike some other reviewers, I didn't find them annoying or unlikeable.  I thought the film was remarkably successful for what it was trying to do, which was not to be a great classic, but a good, solid, scary monster movie.

B000002UAF|5.0|Usually when some one asks me about the British Invasion, the first thing that comes to mind is this album as well as the movie of the same name.  Being the Beatles first album in which all tracks were written by them,  this is the album that best represents everything the Beatles early work as well as the early British invasion was about.      The title track is pure pop rock with it's simple and playful lyrics set to a hard rockin' but catchy melody.  After having seen the movie, one cannot hear this song without seeing, in their mind, the fab four racing down the street chased by tons of wild fans.  It was obvious from the success of both this album and the movie that the British Invasion had completely blown open the doors as the biggest movement in rock history.  No longer just a skiffle group from Liverpool, the Beatles had made it in America and were beginning to broaden their skills as songwritingers.    \\"If I Fell\\" is one of their first and best ballads.  \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\" was their most advanced song to date as far as it's simple but universal message goes.  While the youthful \\"I Should Have Known Better\\" reminds one of \\"Love Me Do\\", \\"I'll Be Back Again\\" is unlike anything they had done at that time.  An acoustic number , it's lyrics seem almost unfinished and it's melody is notably haunting.  It's songs like that that make, \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" really stand out.  Clearly, this album, while not on the level of \\"Rubber Soul\\" or \\"Revolver\\", saw the group advancing with their musical ambitions.    In a way, this is the group's best early album.  While, \\"Help\\" saw the band increasing even more in popularity and skill, nothing else best represents the peak of their \\"pop\\" days as much as this one.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I fell in love with Kristin Chenoweth from her strange and funny performance in Candide.  I then forgot her (I'm fickle that way) until I heard a wonderful voice on the XM radio Broadway station singing a selection from Wicked.  I didn't know the voice was Ms Chenoweth.  It was months later that I happened to remember that song and that voice.   I only heard it once, and yet it stuck in my head and popped up out of the blue - very wicked indeed.   I googled Wicked to find that the voice and Chenoweth, are the same.   I think I already knew it her before I googed.    I had never heard of Wicked.   The story sounded fun, and the one song I heard was enough to get me to buy the CD.  The entire collection of music is wonderful.   Although I've not seen the performance,  I did  extensive research into Oz when I was a child, and I once slept at a motel 6.     The story is in the music.  I always felt that Tinker Bell vacationed in OZ, but Hook's lawyers prevented that part of the story from going public.      Idina Menzel has given a beautiful voice to the wicked witch.  I understand she is green?  Black & White TV didn't show that part.   How can anyone who sings like that be so green?   Thanks to Menzel's performance,  I'm feeling a bit torn between East & West.   Should I feel guilty?    Along with witches, you get JOEL GREY (we love him!), and more talent than sticks can be shaken at.   A $10 ticket to this entertainment should be illegal!  Get it before the Feds close down this racket.
B0013XS8A2|5.0|It's not fair for me to say that I'm no fan of Mike Oldfield's music since, before now, I had never heard anything by him - not even Tubular Bells.  I had seen his name tossed around, especially in conjunction with Tubular Bells, but I never felt intrigued enough to seek out anything by him.  I more or less disregarded him as a New Ager with zero musical sensibilities.<br /><br />How wrong I was!<br /><br />I came about this piece of music by sheer chance, it seems.  In fact, I probably wouldn't have purchased the album if Amazon hadn't included it among its recommendations for things I \\"might also like.\\"  I checked out a couple of reviews both here and on iTunes, and it seemed that everybody who had listened to it couldn't say hardly a negative thing about it.  Wondering \\"what gives,\\" I decided to drop a little cash and see precisely what everyone was chattering about.<br /><br />It turns out, what everyone is chattering about happens to be one of the most spectacular, luscious musical landscapes I've heard in quite a long time - and given that I'm almost constantly purchasing new music ranging from composed music (such as this) to hip-hop/rap, I feel this is quite a compliment.<br /><br />This music defies physics:  time altogether seems to pass by slowly, but not dull.  No, far from it: every second is enjoyable!  From the warm, celestial textures of the opening \\"Harbinger\\" to the soothing, blissful vocal of Hayley Westenra featured on \\"On My Heart,\\" as I listen to this music I truly feel as if I'm swimming through atmospheres, dancing among the stars, and watching a divine interplay among the heavens.  I'm not exaggerating.  These metaphors are completely valid!  The music vaguely reminds me of some of Aaron Copland's classic works (\\"Appalachian Spring\\"), and the way the vocals are utilized reminds me of Howard Shore (\\"Lord of the Rings\\") which may or may not prove to be an unfair comparison.  There are hints of Oldfield's foray in to New Age as I'm reminded of Adiemus during certain sections, but I definitely don't think this is a bad thing.  In all actuality, Oldfield's approach to classically composed music is refreshing given the rather stagnant nature such music has been in: either contemporary composers are selling us watered-down music in the traditional vein, or we're being exposed to unnecessary avant-garde hybrids.  It's nice to hear a piece of music by a gentleman who hasn't got his head stuck in the clouds of Julliard.<br /><br />Even if I never hear another work by Mike Oldfield as long as I live, this one will reign supreme among my other treasured works by the likes of P&auml;rt, Copland, Glass, and even Sibelius.but I definitely don't think this is a bad thing.

0143039431|5.0|Steinbeck's novel of social injustice was from the beginning considered a Great American Novel selling over 300,000 copies in its first year, \\"a phenomenon on the scale of a national event. It was publicly banned and burned by citizens, it was debated on national radio hook-ups; but above all, it was read.\\" Steinbeck scholar John Timmerman sums up the book's impact: \\"The Grapes of Wrath may well be the most thoroughly discussed novel - in criticism, reviews, and college classrooms - of twentieth century American literature.\\" Within a year John Ford made a major movie starring Henry Fonda and in 1962 the Nobel committee cited The Grapes of Wrath as a \\"great work\\" and as one of the committee's main reasons for granting Steinbeck the Nobel Prize for Literature.<br /><br />Perhaps it's most fundamental message is the equality of life, there is no difference between the poor and rich, other than a bank account, all life is sacred. Treat a poor person with dignity and respect and they will and can do as well as anyone else. It is a timeless message and one that bears constant repeating, although Steinbeck's treatment is a bit folksy and sentimental.<br /><br />Contemporary critic Carl Van Doren said \\"This novel did more than any other Depression novel to revise the picture of America as Americans imagined it.\\" The American image of the frontier pioneer moving westward had shifted to the Joad family. The Joads encapsulated the American character and spirit of independence, scrappy can-do hard-working virtuous, an American hero archetype. Martin Seymour-Smith says the work is fundamentally flawed because Steinbeck can not show why the California businessmen's behavior is wrong - after all, they are just trying to make a living, would the Joad's in their shoes have acted any different? \\"There is a conflict in him [Steinbeck] between the philosophical unanimist and the humane socialist,\\" in other word how the Joad's treat animals (as objects) but demand equality in humans. Thus the books message of all life being sacred, no matter its circumstance, is fundamentally contradicted.<br /><br />In the end Grapes of Wrath is of epic proportions and a gripping story. It's often seen as the quintessential American novel of the 1930s and certainly one of Steinbeck's best (along with Of Mice and Men).sage of all life being sacred, no matter its circumstance, is fundamentally contradicted.

B0000DI7UR|3.0|This is the only Stratovarius album that I own.  Apparently it is a sequel to an earlier release.  This is bombastic power / progressive metal.  The music is all big loud guitars, soaring vocals and the occasional keyboard solo.  I like this album ok although there are other bands of this ilk that I like better.  It is a bit difficult to judge from just one album.  I like it ok, but it does not blow me away.

B000002I99|5.0|This CD was purchased for my fiance.  I am not a big fan of Alice Cooper but he is.
B00012BD0S|5.0|There isn't a weak song on this album. The two ballads, The Accolade and Candelight Fantasia are classics of beautiful melodies. I play those two tracks, the title track 'The Divine Wings of Tragedy', and Eyes of the Medusa the most. 'The Divine Wings of Tragedy' changes pace artfully with driving beats and serene vocal movements. Eyes of the Medusa uses key changes maybe a little more unusual to the band. That said, of great importance is the fact THIS BAND CHANGES KEY. Both have been concert favorites, but so are the first three tracks on the album. They are consistently voted among the most favorite by fans. So that leaves the Pharoah and the Witching hour. They complete an album that is consistant in high quality with the most 'dance worthy' choruses. Of course, what makes some of the concepts I have written about here is an idea changing with the individual. This album is a great place for a new fan to start.
B0007LXPBI|5.0|I was a huge fan of the 1961 original film version of \\"The Parent Trap\\" during my formative years. Hayley Mills gave a lively and spry performance in her dual role as the twin sisters raised on opposite sides of the U.S. who meet at a girl's camp, discover the truth about their relationship amid some antagonism, and scheme to reunite their divorced parents.   Some 37 years later, audiences had the pleasure of viewing an innocent red-haired  freckle-faced Lindsay Lohan inhabit the same role with a squirrel-like, beady-eyed impishness.  Free-spirited  Hallie Parker arrives at Camp Walden from the vineyard where she lives with her father, Nick (Dennis Quaid) in Napa Valley, California. She makes friends, but soon has an initially unfortunate run-in with a more conservatively raised look-alike camp mate from England named Annie James, the daughter of London-based fashion designer Elizabeth James (Natasha Richardson). The two begin a series of malicious pranks against each other and their tentmates, which ultimately result in the camp leader (Polly Holiday) sending them to the Isolation Tent. Gradually, the girls address their grievances, and in talking, discover they're twins, and form a plan of action that will enable them to get to know the parent they had missed, and ultimately bring their parents back together.   Their isolation from other camp mates gives them more time to focus on each other and their plan. Annie undergoes a few physical alterations(Haircut, ear-piercing) to make her look more like her twin.    When Hallie travels to London, all goes smoothly, and she is brought  home by her family's posh but hip butler, Martin (Simon Kuntz). She meets her grandfather(Ronnie Stevens) as he is in his study. But her reunion with her mother is a particularly emotional one.   Soon the two pass the famous Abbey Road as they cover the brief distance between home and  Elizabeth's fashion studio. Hallie is deeply impressed and excited seeing her mother at work, but dropssubtle hints about Annie's desire to know her father.   Annie arrives in California as Hallie, greeted by her father and her strong and warm-hearted nanny, Chessy(Lisa Ann Walter). But there is a hitch in the sisters' plan to reunite their parents when publicist Meredith Blake (Elaine Hendrix), whom Nick began dating while Hallie was at camp, sets her sights on becoming the next Mrs. Parker, and Annie and Chessy know she is only in it for Nick's money.   Accompanied by Martin, Elizabeth and Hallie travel to California so that the twins can be switched back.   As the parties involved arrive at the Stafford Hotel in San Francisco, we are treated to a cameo by the original \\"Parent Trap\\" cast member, Joanna Barnes--once the vixen to be eliminated--now playing the mother of one.The major parties pass each other by , but eventually converge, and the meeting of the two servants provides an interesting subplot.The reunion of the two ex-spouses here is less volatile than in the 1961 version and Natasha Richardson has a chance to be less dignified, and in fact, goofier than Maureen O'Hara.   The parents dine together amicably when the girls recreate their first date, but the next day, it appears the two halves of the family will remain apart, and Nick Parker take the treacherous Meredith as his bride.   What will the girls do? All they have in their favor are the remaining days of summer, a significant outing, and the power of identicallness. Will it be enough?

I am a veterinarian and frequently hear pet owners say that they won't feed X brand of food to their dogs because the first ingredient is corn.  After reading this book, I think: at least the dog food is honest.  I just grabbed a random product from my pantry shelf to read the ingredient list.  Enchilada sauce: just tomatoes and spices, right?  Wrong.  It contains modified corn starch, monosodium glutamate, citric acid and hydrolyzed vegetable protein: all corn by-products.    Mr. Pollan has definitely made me more aware of what my family is eating.

B0014Z4OQG|4.0|SPOILERS!      I was expecting a rampaging-monster flick where the creature eventually dies from something really simple, like water, or the bad taste of humans in its mouth.    However, Cloverfield (where did that name originate, by the way?) has much more than a rampage going on.  There's a run for dear life, the willingness to go back for a beloved woman even though she might have been dead already, the grief for a fallen brother and a friend, and a relationship that endures to the bitter end.    I was quite impressed by the way the special effects team made it look as if all of Manhattan was being destroyed; so much destruction on such a massive scale could not have been easy to simulate, even with green screen tech.   And that monster---it was much worse than the one in the far less superior movie The Mist.   Kudos to the monster designer as well.   The image of the camera operator being eaten was quite stunning.    I have no problems with the handheld camera; it really didn't bother me on the small screen, though it might have on a larger one.  The movie does leave one with several unresolved issues to ponder, though:  Where did this monster come from?  Did someone create it in a lab or send it here from another planet?  Why didn't the military nuke the city to make sure it was gone for good?   Why did the bombs they dropped on it have no discernible effect?  What were those smaller creatures that emanated from its body?  Were the filmmakers making an allegory about terrorist attacks or random violence and evil that strikes the most innocent and unsuspecting people?      Good for an hour or so of action and terror.

The white man/black man buddy/partner genre has been done to death. Here it is again. Throw in some S. Africa and Western guilt over what Westerners imagine must be going on in Africa and you have the usual formula. This has to be DiCaprio's worst movie, five Academy Award nominations or not. Still, it can hold up to a viewing if you get it out of the library for free, as I did. Avoid if you don't like an endless hail of bullets as your entertainment.

B0015KO52S|4.0|As good as the 1st Raconteurs album was, this is probably better. The songs are stronger and less Beatles-derivative, and Jack White is in top form.  The style varies from folk-country to hard rock, all masterfully done.  White and Benson share the vocal chores with passion.

It definitely should be moving people in the right direction toward improving our society.  I really think a collective effort can create 'a new earth'.

The camera type recording was ridicilous and dizzy and the whole story was DUMB.  This is NOT even worth renting and the ending is bulls%^t.  I could not believe it was even made.  Wasted my 80 mins.

B000H7JD4A|4.0|I've been a fan of Iron Maiden since the early 80's-- what has surprised me about them:  they they have managed to produce 14 studio albums (a dated word I realize) in almost 30 years of existence, selling (from the reports I've read) about 70 million units (cds, cassettes, albums) during that span.  This is a remarkable feat.<br /><br />Added to this that after each new cd, in most cases they toured for months and months to promote it.  That's a lot of touring.<br /><br />The other surprising aspect is that, for the most part, the quality of all their work has maintained a high standard for all these years.  I've always considered Maiden a 'thinking man's' metal band- their lyrics are intelligent, and sophisticated, exploring history, politics, warfare, culture, religion, literature, the paranormal.  And the awesome music speaks for itself.<br /><br />Buy this cd, and the other 13 studio cds in their catalog to fully appreciate their music.
0375842209|1.0|this book was so confusing, and hard to understand. i do not recommend this book to anyone!!!  unless you want to spend forever trying to figure out what certain phrases mean.

1400063515|5.0|I'm giving this book five stars to apply what I learned about the dangers of staying in the middle.  I think this book was written with the financial investment community in mind - and I learned some important lessons about mitigating investment risks - but that's not why I started reading it.  I started reading it because I fully connected with the prologue - especially with NNT's commentary about how those who successfully avoid \\"Black Swans\\" are never rewarded for their success.  We tend to glorify those who come to the rescue only after something catastrophic occurs, whereas there is no way to reward the real heroes - those who avoid the catastrophe, because we have no way to identify who they are.  In fact, we tend to scorn them for making us do uncomfortable things that save lives by avoiding Black Swans.  NNT's compelling argument made about a gutsy politician who may have taken a pro-active stand against the 9/11 attacks is what hooked me (on page xix). But unfortunately there was no further discussion on this, which I believe would be an interesting topic for any engineer, sociologist, or philosopher to continue with.    Other than that one disappointment, I am happy to have finished the book.  I now see the bell curve and standard deviations differently and something potentially dangerous, whereas before I had not given it any thought.  The parts written about good, desirable Black Swans are right-on and a fine argument against complacency.  It puts you in control of your destiny rather than being made the victim while watching others around you steal the glory. NNT hits a home run in the final chapter by wrapping-up some of the details I had problems with earlier, which for me made the tough read worth while.  Yes, we are all Black Swans.
0486282112|5.0|i read this book right after dracula and well, it's definitely a good read and an edge of your seat thriller.  it has stood the test of time in terms of it's theme and lesson.
0143038419|1.0|I too would not give it any stars.  I couldn't finish it and have passed it to several friends, all of whom either couldn't get in to it or just plain didn't like it.  I'm still trying to figure out who likes it and why it is such a big deal.  The only person I have come across who actually liked it was a woman in the book store who thought it was the greatest book she ever read.  My comment is, she must not read much.
B00154GEFU|5.0|This CD gets better the more it is played.  Musical, it has much to offer.  Unfortunately I am not a fan of the Payne error, but I appreciare Geoff keeping the band going with the hopes of reunion arising as it does here with Phoenix.  In this day when the record companies have pretty much vanished, we are seeing more bands producing themselves and marketing their own material. I think this deserves recognition.  It is extreemly nice that Steve Howe participated fully and contributed material here.
1577314808|5.0|An exceedingly well-written book, synthesizing much of what are available in Hindu Vedanta and Buddha's Dhammapada as well as much of what J.Krishnamurti wrote and spoke about in his expositions regarding the philosophy of healthy living. It is a pity that Eckhart does not have the syntonic ego (inner space that he advocates everyone to discover) structure to acknowledge the ancient contributions of both Hindu and Buddhist thoughts in developing his un-original but very useful exposition of the \\"Power of Now\\". The book is indeed worth reading by those who are unfamiliar with or \\"afraid\\" of being exposed to non-Christian philosophical constructs.
B0014Z4OQG|4.0|When purchased this movie is was with some reservations as alot of people said thet=y were dizzy and got sick or were mad about the production and the way it was done.  If you liked 1408 then you will like this movie and if you like edge of your seat thrillers..this is very well done. From the very begining you are drawn into a young bunch of friends just saying goodbye to one of the group who is going to japan for an extended stay as part of his job. the characters were filled out and used to make you wonder what was next and the reactions to what was happening were what you would expect from the situations they are put in.  The movies flows along with suspense at evey corner and except for a ending that kinda leaves you hanging i love this movie...with a better ending this would have been a perfect 10
0452289963|5.0|This is an excellent addition as a work-book to apply the concepts elucidated by the author in his earlier \\"The Power of Now\\". The book combined with the monday night discussion on oprah.com ought to be very helpful to those who want to understand and apply the power of discovering non-duality as a powerful aid in conferring to oneself the \\"peace that passeth all understanding\\".    However, it is both sad and disconcerting to observe the reluctance of the author to credit the sources of his ideas to Hindu Vedanta, Buddhist tenets and J. Krishnamurti's excellent commentaries on living.    It has long been known and wisely acknowledged by many western philosophers of the stellar contributions of Eastern philosophers such as Sankara, Buddha, Lao Tzu, J. Krishnamurti, Aurobindo et al. And, yet Eckhart Tolle does not seem to find it either appropriate or necessary to acknowledge the sources of his \\"ideas\\" which are actually borrowed from eastern thoughts on life and sane living!    If a non-European new-ager had done anything similar to what Eckhart had done, say for example, used Hegel's or Kant's expositions in developing his or her own \\"copyrighted\\" new \\"ways\\" of seeking enlightenment, there would be howls of plagiarism. But, in the instance of Eckhart and Oprah using this material widely on the internet, there has been no complaints, except from fundamentalist Christians who claim much of Eckhart's writings to be anti-Christian without understanding that the seminal ideas in the pre-Christian Vedic literature of Hindus and or Buddha's Dhammapada, are also found in the teachings of Jesus of Nazareth as well!
B000ICL3KG|1.0|Oh my gosh folks... please believe me when I say I am the sort who firmly believes in being environmentally conscious but this piece of propaganda has near zero technical merit.  Ok, yes, CO2 has a higher absorptivity than Nitrogen, but just like the color black, it has a higher emissivity.  I.e. additional CO2 in the atmosphere provides no net gain.  Mr. Gore neglects to mention that CO2 will emit more heat to space at night, approximately equal to the additional heat absorbed during the day.  His analogy of evil \\"heat men\\" coming to the earth and stopping is, I am sorry, stupid.  This film does little more than give ammunition to those who seek to prove the environmental movement is without any merit.  Oh, and it likely made Mr. Gore millions.

B0013K6WLM|3.0|As a fan of TBK and owner of everything they have ever produced I bought this album even knowing the potential pitfalls.  Yes, it is better than what a lot of bands are putting out, which makes it good.  However it is not to the standards we expect from TBK.  This doesn't even come close to the dirt and grit of Thickfreakness or Rubber Factory.   The chunky riffs are apparent on maybe half the songs on this album.  Bottom line? Too slick.  That being said, I just saw the boys live here in Seattle and it was all raw!!!!  In this day and age with so many side projects from bands they should have grabbed a vocalist and released this under a different name.  Consider this Danger Mouse thing a failed experiment.  I will be anxiously awaiting your next album.
B00154GEFU|4.0|My first listen to Phoenix did kind of underwhelm me because I was listening for those power pop tunes that they reeled off seemingly non-stop in the early 80's.  There are a few songs on here that would fit comfortably in with their recordings from that time, 'Never Again' starts off reminding us slightly of 'Heat Of The Moment' with Steve Howe crunching off a short guitar riff before the rest of the band joins in. It's a contagious song with a great chorus.  'Alibis' is the only song that gives writing credits to the entire band.  It's has a light feel to it, but moves along at a crisp pace.  'An Extraordinary Life' closes out the disc with an anthem about seizing the day no matter what goes on around you and that life is a gift with each day filled with wonderful possibilities. After Wetton's health issues last year which required him having triple heart bypass surgery, its pretty poignant stuff.  Those are the 3 songs that jumped out at me on first listen as being 'classic' Asia.    Then I listened to it several more times more closely and found much more to like.  Instrumental passages leading into and out of songs giving it more of a prog-rock then pop feel and some well crafted melodies are found throughout.  Listening to it again, I find that the only song that tends to drag for me is 'Orchard Of Mines'.  Other then one song, the rest of the disc grows on you.  It's not a radical departure from what they did initially all those years ago, instead there's a maturation that comes through, both in the lyrics and in the music.     I'd give it a solid 4 stars only because it took a few listens to really appreciate it.  I dont think its perfect, but in this age of American Idol where so many 'artists' sound exactly alike and are almost interchangeable, it's a wonderful change of pace and like catching up with an old friend.
B0006GAO5Y|1.0|I bought this because of the fact that the DVD cover said \\" Nominated for 10 acadamy awards!\\"  This movie is aweful! 1 star is giving it too much credit.  I love Sly Stallone but his acting was too painful to watch.  I went to bed after suffering through the first hour.  My wife informed me that it didn't get any better.  If this movie were to be released in this day and age, it wouldn't have a chance!
0452289963|1.0|from all indications, mr tolle makes money with his vacuous pronouncements: far be it from me to put him down.  however... as with infomercials promising the secret of effortless millions, there's no way around the paradox of first premises, eg, if you really know the secret of effortless money, why are you working so hard to convince me to send $19.95 right now?  or, in tolles's case, if you've achieved selflessness, why are you so discordantly singing this song of yourself?<br /><br />historically, spiritual masters don't say much.  christ, if you believe the gospels, said very little.  alternatively, people most exquisitely burdened by self tend to publish prolifically.  after all, you can't spell 'creativity' without 'e,' 'g,' and 'o.'  (although, really,  'g' and 'o' are superfluous; still, of what use is it to remark here that you cannot spell 'boogie' without 'e,' 'g,' and 'o?')

0684857219|5.0|I am not a bodybuilder but this book is not just for bodybuilders.  This book is for anyone who works out and wants more information on weight lifting, strength training, or body building.  It is for anyone that works out with weights. It is the best book I have on the subject, and I have several shelves devoted to exercise, fitness, training, etc.<br /><br />This 800 page book is divided into 5 smaller books.  Book 1 is an Introduction to Bodybuilding and includes everything from the evolution and history of bodybuilding to equipment you might need to get started.  Book 2 is called Training Programs, and includes basic training principles, stretching, basic and advanced programs, and using your mind to really focus and work your muscles to their fullest.  Book 3 is called Body Part Exercises and teaches a lot about anatomy as well as including full descriptions (with pics) of almost every exercise under the sun that will work each body part.  Book 4 includes everything you might want to know or need to know about competitions, and Book 5 covers Health, Nutrition, and Diet.<br /><br />This book has helped me immensely! Although I haven't followed Arnold's recommended specific routines, I have learned so much from this book I have been able to bring to my own workouts.  It is surprisingly interesting, well-written, and completely informative.  I have learned so much more about proper form, specifics regarding nutrition, and new exercises I had not tried before.  And, although it is called an \\"encyclopedia\\", the truth is, it's a book that is fun to read-- there is such an abundance of information here that make the book very difficult to put down.<br /><br />The book is paperback, but it's very well made.  The binding has withstood a lot of reading and bending-- the spine and pages are still intact.  The book is illustrated with many helpful black and white photos and the pages are high quality with only a little gloss-- very easy to read.
B0000DIXDR|4.0|The dancing and the music overshadow the well-worn storyline in the classic Patrick Dempsey flick.  A movie to be enjoyed over and over again for the dancing and the music.
B00007JMCX|4.0|Like many others, I picked this up because I'm a Bowie fan.  And, wow, he is incredible in the role of the alien to falls to earth.  Having seen him in this role, I can't imagine any one else who could portray this character.  His alien isn't cute or adorable, like E.T. or Mork; his is a true alien in every sense of the word.    I knew nothing of the novel by Walter Tevis from which the film is adapted.  But I was intrigued by the liner notes that told a bit about his life, his own sense of alienation when he moved as a child to Kentucky, how his frail size and accent made him a target for many beatings, and of his own 17 year struggle with alcholism.  Undoubtably it's the depth of his personal experience that imbues the story with such resonance.  Indeed, he says that the Man is not necessarily from another planet, but that it is his mindset that creates his feeling of alienation.     I went over to the Book section of Amazon to read the reviews of the book and it seems that there are some superficial differences between it and the film, but the main pain of the theme is still as poignant in each.     I would like to read the book, perhaps just to fill in some of the gaps that many reviewers notice in this film, that make it a little hard to fathom in parts.  However, the fact that this film was so gorgeously made does seem to enhance the orginal story a lot.  Nicholas Roeg, first a visual artist and then a cinematographer, adds a whole other layer to the story, with his splendid photography.  I am no fan of science fiction at all; just the sight of folks in shiny sleek silver outfits with wierd eyes and ears makes me want to run away (I never could watch Star Wars for just that reason.)  But I found the few scenes of the Man, falling, in his silver wrapper, and especially the shots of the family he left behind on the troubled planet very lovely and moving.     And, then, there is the phenomenon of the strangely beautiful David Bowie.  His presence, alone, is worththe price of admission!  He is a true original and gives credibility to the notion that he might just be from another planet(!)  He is a reason enough to turn the book into a film.    The story, as others have told here, is relatively simple.  A man, named Newton, from the planet Anthea, leaves home to come to Earth.  The book gives different reasons; the film states that Anthea has had an extended drought and he hopes to send water back.  He possesses advanced technological knowledge which he uses to take over a large corporation in hopes that they will build a space craft for him.     At first all goes well, due to the extraordinary skill of Newton.  He hides his secret and keeps distant from any social contact.  However, in a hotel in Artesia, New Mexico, he collapses in the elevator and is rescued by the hotel maid, Mary Lou (Candy Clark.)  She is the perfect person to bring some warmth, if not color, to his pale cheeks:  warm, cute, irrepressably friendly, and not too bright. At first I found her efforts to \\"humanize\\" the poor alien quite touching.  The scene where he shows her the lake where he plans to build a house and he actually holds her hand for a few seconds is amazing.  It takes them a while but they eventually have a sexual relationship, (which Roeg is not shy about showing.)      Things look good for a while--she helps him decorate the house which he has done in Japanese decor, for some reason---I guess it matches his ascetic taste.  However, poor Mary Ann, shares not only her love of life, church and sex with Newton, but her taste for gin.  He prefers water at first but then gives in and soon the two of them manage to consume lots and lots of it. It's really scary to see all of the empty bottles sitting around---you can see how alcoholism was truly a demon for Tavis.  The film could be convincingly used as an anti-drinking document.      In time, Newton is corrupted by the pleasures of Earth and the duplicity of the Earthlings. It's a simple fableand certainly worth thinking about.  I would have preferred a happier ending--something about the triumph of the human spirit or the Anthean spirit or some kind of spirit, but it's the alcoholic spirits that win, and that is truly sad.      In addition to Bowie, the  rest of the cast is wonderful.  Rip Torn plays a sleazy, smart guy who leaves his job teaching college, where he enjoyed the company of numerous co-eds, eager to earn a good grade (again Roeg is graphic in showing the details) to go to greener pastures to work for the company that is employing Newton.  Torn's performance is easy to overlook in the brilliant company of Bowie, but he is just right in showing the affable but morally compromised man that he is.  He's funny, too and the sex scenes are hilarious, especially the first one where his girlfriend's bra ends up on the photo of the professor's estranged wife and daughter.  It tells us all we need to know about him.    Candy Clark is perfect as the wonderfully warm, terribly sad woman who loves her \\"Tommy.\\" (Newton) Time passes and her drinking turns her from a fresh faced young girl into a puffy faced middle aged woman.  She still loves life in her own way, decorates her home with Christmas ornaments and has taken up with the professor, who, for some reason wears a Santa suit, as they visit the local liquor shop.  It's quite perfect. Buck Henry is here as the head of the world corp that employs Newton and he is always good, although it's a pretty lack luster role that doesn't give him a chance to really shine.     As mentioned, there are a lot of sex scenes which should please some and dismay others.  It's the 70's and the vogue in film making was to show it all.  I don't like a lot of gratuitious sex-for-shock-value scenes but I thought these were well done.  I can't say \\"tasteful\\" because they are purposely not \\"tasteful\\" but for me, they worked.      I have the AnchorBay edition and, from what I've read here, I wish I had the Criterion edition.For one thing, there are no English subtitles on this (don't know what Criterion has) and I missed a lot of what Bowie said.  So I was a little confused during the second half, although others said that certain key scenes were cut which would have better explained the scenario.  I would have liked to hear the comments that Criterion offers.    This is a film that sticks with you,  because of its story, its gorgeous style and especially the performances.  I am tempted to give it five stars--just the terribly sad ending spoiled it for me.
0634022296|5.0|I just have to start out by saying that the one for \\"blackbird\\" in this book is astonish. It's amazing, the exact chords on the recording and i reckon you can even use it to fingerpick! :-)!     Ok now to the main point, this book might be a bit big and you can't put it standing up perfectly on your music stand, i know i know. With that in mind, I would suggest you be careful with it... because i kinda made a little tear on a few pages already. But this shouldn't downplay the book's intellectual and \\"inside of the cover\\" qualities, after it's a book...    So on to the next pro. I know you can go on the net and get lots of tabs, but i guarantee you mate, this is the best! It's really in the exact keys as on the recordings!    Be aware that if you want to play the songs on PLEASE PLEASE ME, you won't find \\"Baby it's you\\" \\"Chains\\" and a few others on there. That's for the reason that those songs were covers. The Beatles didn't write them. Hence if they didn't write them, they really can't have it on your sheet music catalouge...    OVERALL, this book is great mate, get it if you're a beatles fanatic like me and many others out there. GOODLUCK WITH THE FAB FOUR!

B000E9910W|2.0|Beware if you choose to purchase this set.  I did without realizing that some of the songs are completely chopped up, namely 'Jesus Is Just Alright.'  It sounds nothing like the album version.  If the individual albums are remastered, I will burn my own version of the cd with unedited album cuts replacing the butchered songs here.  Pretty pathetic and unforgivable when two discs are used to compile the set.  The remastering is ok, but there is still not enough low end on the older songs.  The Doobie Brothers are like Chicago.  You get a recycled greatest hits package every year.  Again, beware.

I was so motivated from my workout that I decided to eat \\"clean\\" for dinner. PLUS, I didn't raid the fridge at 3am like I usually do. I am hopeful and thankful. Thank you Jillian.
0743277708|4.0|Watership Down encompasses a journey of rabbits in search for a new warren to live in safety. While this objective may seem simple to accomplish, the rabbits run into many obstacles along the way and such a goal becomes distant but not impossible to these fervent animals. Of course, the rabbits portray human qualities such as emotion, language, and complex cognitive thought. Needless to say then, it is obvious that each rabbit on this journey is an individual who carries their own personality. So while the novel concentrates on the journey  of the rabbits itself, it effectively incorporates each of the rabbits journey also. Such a novel about brave rabbits in search for a new home, surpassing barriers, and finally reaching a content end seems to be a typical \\"hero's journey.\\" Indeed, this plot resembles the stereotypical journey, but the author does so in such a creative and interesting way. I found that reading from an animals point of view is rather interesting, even though the complexities of their thoughts are probably unlike our own. Normally, heroes are associated with people. This novel, however, defeats that archetype extending it to our fellow creatures. Next, their journey was quite suspenseful. At first, reading about rabbits finding a new home may seem anything but engrossing. Yet here again, the author tactfully renders the journey as interesting as our own would be. Reading more into the novel, the characters grow on you and the danger they face becomes important to the reader. True, nature can be so fascinating. The book itself was rather ideal in that I began to think I was reading a child's book. Not in a derogatory sense at all. It was an easy read that was enjoyable to the point where it was as if I was a kid again enjoying a heroic story. It was not as if I as a busy college student reading the book without interest just to quickly memorize the comprehension for an upcoming test. In my opinion therefore, the author creatively takes a classictale and generates it into an unorthodox novel.
B0015HS5TA|4.0|This is a delight film with none of the killing and blood that movie makers seem to think makes for a hit. So what if you do see the young guy's buns, but the movie is a romance, not a sex film. Big difference. My wife and I both enjoyed this and laughed through several scenes.  The theater viewers' reactions almost made a second delight.  A truly fun movie filled with comedy, romance, period costumes and scenery (England) as well as such wonderful music.<br /><br />The music alone is worth the purchase. Perhaps the book as well, since it is based on a book by the same name. I can't recommend the book (YET) but go to the movie, or buy the DVD when available, or perhaps the CD. I'm sure you'll enjoy those.  One scene we'd seen in the trailer was deleted in the movie. That's just one more reason we'll be buying the DVD--to see the deleted scenes.<br /><br />I give it only 4 1/2 stars because the story has a bit of a predictable ending. But even the predictability of girls getting the boys was a fun day with Miss Pettigrew. Yes! The entire movie takes place in a single day. If you have a day with as much fun packed into 24 hours as Miss Pettigrew, you'd remember it, and it would make just as good of a movie as this one. Bottom line...try it in some media form.<br /><br />You too, can live for a day, like Miss P.
032147404X|5.0|[[ASIN:032147404X The Digital Photography Book, Volume 1]]    I sell my work to magazines and I have found that this book is one of the best for the working photographer that I have in my library.  It doesn't tell you how your camera works, or about f/stops or shutter speeds.  What it does is to help you when you are on a shoot.  As Scott Kelby explains this book, he says that it is like your on a shoot with someone who is a real big time pro.  You turn to him/her and ask, \\"how is your camera set up to take this shot?\\"  And then explains how you should set your camera.  Each page is a lesson, with a picture at the top of the page, and the lesson below as to how the results were arrived at.  I love this book.  I have taken pictures since 1958 and never had a good flower picture until I read this.  I sell my work to magazines, and I have found that this is a good book to own.  In fact I have purchased a second copy for my son, and have advised others about the value of owning this book.    Strong statement?  Not if it helps you the way it helped me.

0307237702|4.0|The Audacity of Hope by Barack Obama    The right to vote is to be taken seriously and the election process of 2008 is and remains difficult for most of us. For me, basic questions are:    1. What qualities do I look for in a person to lead the United States?  2. Where do the people running for office come from?  3. When did these candidates do something memorable that would inspire my vote?  4. Why would I vote for any of the candidates running for office?  5. Who are the candidates?  6. How do these candidates plan to lead during the next four or eight years?    Hillary Clinton is a known quantity. We have seen her in action for eight years while she was in the White House. John McCain is another person that we are familiar with, but to answer these basic questions about Barack Obama, I decided to read two of his books: \\"Dreams from my father, a story of race and inheritance\\" and \\"The Audacity of Hope.\\"    Through Dreams of my father we are introduced to a man raised by his mother, a white woman from Kansas who married a young African man from Kenya. The marriage takes place while they lived in Hawaii.     Barack Obama surfaces as a person who struggles to understand the separate worlds that shaped his personality and in a search for identity he travels to Chicago and gets a job working as a community organizer. His full journey to discovery is completed when he travels to Kenya where he meets his African relatives, including his brothers and sisters, and becomes aware of the truth about his father's life.    Now, The Audacity of Hope presents the mature man, graduated from Harvard, accomplished, a best selling author, who through this work shares his views of the political arena and criticizes partisanship divisiveness, in particular Republicans.    What are his values? He is concerned about big government, but works as a Senator, therefore, he is part of our big government. His religious values are rather contradictory for he is in favor of a woman's right to anabortion and yet, he respects those who are in favor of protecting life at all costs. Throughout the readings I get the impression that he is agnostic or at least questions why \\"he has never seen angels coming down from heaven.\\"    Did I read a clear map to what he calls a time for \\"change?\\" NO, am I confused? Yes, why does he say that we live in the best country in the world and yet we need to change? I completely agree with Obama when he says that an education is the key to improving future generations.    Does the book reveal qualities befitting the next leader of the USA? Has he done something memorable and worthy? Does his past provide the courage to lead those that are different and have not lived his experiences? Will Obama be able to lead our nation through these troubled times? In all fairness, read the books and make your own assessment, let's hope that we do vote for the right person to lead us through these troubled times.
0307394549|5.0|This book is just like everything that Martha Stewart puts her name on- gorgeous, thorough, and beautifully designed. There is a visual chart of cookies in the first few pages so you can select your recipe by sight, and they are divided up by types of cookie: chewy, crunchy, etc. so you can choose by texture as well. There are pictures of every recipe, I've only made one so far (pecan logs) but they were a huge hit. The only downside is that a lot of recipes call for a big Kitchen-Aid type mixer with a paddle attachment, which I don't have, but elbow grease works just fine :)
0307383415|3.0|Dreams of my father by Barack Obama    The right to vote is to be taken seriously and the election process of 2008 is and remains difficult for most of us. For me, basic questions are:    1. What qualities do I look for in a person to lead the United States?  2. Where do the people running for office come from?  3. When did these candidates do something memorable that would inspire my vote?  4. Why would I vote for any of the candidates running for office?  5. Who are the candidates?  6. How do these candidates plan to lead during the next four or eight years?    Hillary Clinton is a known quantity. We have seen her in action for eight years while she was in the White House. John McCain is another person that we are familiar with, but to answer these basic questions about Barack Obama, I decided to read two of his books: \\"Dreams from my father, a story of race and inheritance\\" and \\"The Audacity of Hope.\\"    Through Dreams of my father we are introduced to a man raised by his mother, a white woman from Kansas who married a young African man from Kenya. The marriage takes place while they lived in Hawaii.     Barack Obama surfaces as a person who struggles to understand the separate worlds that shaped his personality and in a search for identity he travels to Chicago and gets a job working as a community organizer. His full journey to discovery is completed when he travels to Kenya where he meets his African relatives, including his brothers and sisters, and becomes aware of the truth about his father's life.    Chapter 14 was interesting because it shares the inspiration for the title of his book `The Audacity of Hope.' The phrase comes from a \\"sermon given by Reverend Wright who read a passage from the Book of Samuel, the story of Hannah, who, barren and taunted by her rivals had wept and shaken in prayer before her God and how the story inspires a memory of a painting titled Hope, depicting a harpist who has undergone much and yet still has the desire to share notes with the one string left intact on her instrument... she dares to hope, she has the audacity to make music and praise God.\\"    Does the book reveal qualities befitting the next leader of the USA? Has he done something memorable and worthy? Does his past provide the courage to lead those that are different and have not lived his experiences? Will Obama be able to lead our nation through these troubled times? In all fairness, read the books and make your own judgment, let's hope we do what is right for our future as a democratic nation.    The book was rather tedious to read and frankly, you can speed read through many of the passages, but it revealed where Barack Obama comes from and how his character is shaped.
B00154GEFU|4.0|With a very successful reunion tour with a live cd and dvd, the original and TRUE Asia is back. John Wetton, who is the signature musician of the band ;sounds as good as ever with his trademark awesome voice. Then we have the awesome keyboards of Geoffrey Downes. Let's face it. Without these two, THERE IS NO ASIA!! I do not know what that Payneful sound was the last few so called albums were but now the sound is complete again with Carl Parmer and Steve Howe on guitar. This is the real deal here.The songs are not lame and the vocals do not sound like someone is having a tough time on the toilet.there is also No artificial perservitives and colors on this cd.     Now that I have educated The John Payne gang, let's get to the review of the new cd, won't we?    The album in a whole is very, very, good. It took a few listens to grasp the music and the lyrics. Even though there is not a true hard edge song on the album, the musicianship is abundent. All the members had something to do with most of the songs on the album. If you have some of the solo works of the band you can definitly tell who influenced each part of every song. Even though the band does nothing too fancy ,there is some complexity to most of the songs; like Nothing's Forever and Sleeping Giant/No way Back/ Reprise.There are unexpected mood changes in each of the songs that show some of the influences of each band member.    As far as the singing goes, I don't think there can be a replacemnt for John wetton. Even though some of the songs sound like some of his solo work, his singing is top noch. I would have to say his vocal highlights are the songs Heroine, I Will Remember You and the Extraordinary Life. Speaking of that song, the lyrics are uplifting and inspirational.   As far as Steve Howe, the guitar work is not in your face jam session type of playing but complex and layered very nicely. There are some great slide guitar moments and some great[sometimes too short] guitar solos.   Geoffrey Downes isalways awesome. The arrangements as well as his playing is very good. Carl Palmer playing could of been a little better. So all you drum fans, he is more of a beat keeper on this album.   All in all, this is a very solid album where four great musicians work together and got to put their trademarks in. They worked as a team this time with great results. Remember, this is not the Asia album of yester year. This not the Payneful sound of previous albums. This is a more calmer mellodic supergroup that still makes great music 26 years later.
B000P0J074|3.0|This is an old school DVD. The only extras are \\"Read only\\" no making of or anything. Still, it is a nice picture that we love about DVDs.
072325804X|5.0|Being an avid reader myself as a child, I thought it was so important to begin a collection of fantastic books for my baby. This was one of the first on my list, and I'm thrilled with the quality. The illustrations are stunning, as well as the weighty feel of each page and the nice, thick hardcover.  Not highlighted in the description was the nifty hardback protective sheath that comes with the book--what a fabulous extra!  I know it will be a book my daughter will treasure for many years to come and she will enjoy many bedtimes with this book.  I especially liked that it was the complete tales, not just a few Beatrix Potter favorites--it was important to me that I get the \\"whole collection\\" of stories when buying a book like this.  I'd recommend this book to anyone who values high-quality, heirloom books! You won't be disappointed.
B000WTBMBK|2.0|This appears to be one of those albums which would appeal more to critics than to the general, album-buying public.  I think it's a unique work, very evocative and moody, meticulously crafted and produced, nicely blending dubstep and R & B, simultaneously dirty and crystaline in structure.  Yet each track sounds, to my ears, very much like the previous one.  Of course there are differences and shifts, but their subtlety relegates this work as one for studied, rather than for casual, listening.  It struck me very similar in temperament and tone to Plasticman's \\"[[ASIN:B000006P30 Consumed]]\\" from 10 yrs back.  Ultimately, after repeated listens, I found too little movement between or within the songs on this album for me to recommend it or place it in heavy rotation, and though I do appreciate the artist's contribution in forwarding/expanding the genre, I think Burial's \\"Untrue\\" is overrated by critics.
1400095204|5.0|The book begins with a beautiful capture of a Nigeria at peace facing a post colonial future. Adichie attends to her characters as they slowly enter the drama of the war for Biafra. The reader feels the dread ahead of the characters--and is with them as the horrors of war accumulate in weighty but  unpredictable detail.  Character development, clarity of language and overall pace are outstanding.  Half of a Yellow Sun can be painful to read but this is a superior Novel  --based on this book alone, Adichie is one of our finest writers.
B000002KON|5.0|Called an opera, a concept album, a TV score, the reality is that 'Arthur' is a daringly ambitious album that proved that the Ray Davies and his band were able to remain at the level of the three previous masterpieces starting with 1966's 'Face to Face'. Even more focused on \\"concept\\" than the 'Village Green Preservation Society' album, they pull it off by producing a tremendous range of material, from guitar-based riff rock like \\"Brainwashed\\" unheard on their previous several records to elaborate sonic suites on \\"Australia\\" and the unforgettable \\"Shangri-la\\". Indeed, though more of Dave's stinging lead guitar is evident throughout than on the trinity of previous songwriting epics, there are many songs that show effective use of horn arrangements, chorales, and strong production. The songs are uniformly catchy and the subject matter of past British Empire glory, World War II, and middle class concerns are brought home with some of the Kinks' all-time classics, including \\"Victoria\\", \\"Shangri-La\\" and lesser known but excellent songs, \\"Drivin\\", \\"Nothing to Say\\", and two beautiful ballads, \\"Young and Innocent Days\\" and \\"Some Mother's Son\\".  The former sounds like a song from an LP 15 years later than this one; the latter, about a battlefield loss, is a great example of Ray's ability to paint a picture with lyrics. This LP was a critical success, and has stood the test of time as a musical work. It is an uncompromising triumph of British rock music from 1969 that has been and will remain among the best of the Kinks' albums and vibrant for decades to come.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|I'd like to clear up a few facts for you as a Canadian. While our system is not perfect here, it benefits the poor and middle class in several ways which your for-profit system in the US does not.  The main gist of Moore's work isthat hospitals have staff that actively work to deny patient health care in order to pad the bottom line. In Canada, we refer to this as ultra-capitalism-run-amok or in layman's terms \\"greed.\\" No one will ever have to go through their life's savings in order to receive care in Canada.  In your country, it happens regularly.  In term's of wait times here, medical conditions are prioritized in terms of urgency.  My neighbor who was diagnosed with stage 3 colon cancer received immediate care including access to a wide variety of chemo-drugs and regular CT scans.  I do not know of anyone here who complains of \\"wait\\" times being excessive (perhaps it is because we are thankful that it is free!). Second, our doctors here earn around $200k per year (that is a lot).  All of our doctors live affluent lives. If there is a \\"shortage\\" it is because your system lures them away with even higher salaries!  The British doctor spoke about this in Sicko, where he admitted that he could earn a higher wage in your country, but refuses to out of conscience. My doctor thinks similarly as she is opposed to a system which denies its patients care.<br /><br />We Canadians are very proud of our system, as are the French and British.  We do not allow our governments to keep our people poor, frightened and immobilized in the name of greed and class struggle. The rhetoric is always the same: ie: \\"the greatest country in the world,\\" but as a society, in honesty you do not come close to France or many European countries, or even your neighbor to the north.  You would do well to heed Moore's advice by educating yourselves, and adopting those ways which have proven to be superior to your own.  Perhaps then you will be able to identify Britain on the map, perhaps then you will stop murdering your own citizens under the guise of \\"freedom,\\" \\"democracy,\\" and \\"the American dream\\"--which is code for \\"survival of the fittest.\\"op murdering your own citizens under the guise of \\"freedom,\\" \\"democracy,\\" and \\"the American dream\\"--which is code for \\"survival of the fittest.\\"
B000OZ28IS|5.0|This book was phenomenal. I started it at 3 o' clock one afternoon and just read it straight through, skipping dinner until I finished it.<br /><br />Ruth Gilmartin is a graduate student in history at Oxford, 28-year old single mother of a three-year old son. One hot Saturday in the summer of 1976 her world is turned upside down when her mother reveals that her identity as Sally Gilmartin (nee Fairchild) is an elaborately constructed fabrication. Turns out that Sally is actually Eva Delectorskaya, a Russian emigre recruited to the British Secret Service in 1939, after the murder of her brother, also a spy.<br /><br />Ruth's and Eva's stories unfold in alternating chapters until they finally converge in a climax that will keep you riveted. One slight problem is that Eva's story is way more interesting, so that the chapters devoted to Ruth feel padded: there are some fairly obvious red herrings and a subplot that ends up going nowhere. But these are very minor flaws.<br /><br />Terrific story, great characters, good writing - \\"Restless\\" delivers on all three levels. As other reviewers have pointed out, this book is a bit of a departure for Boyd - it's not quite his typical 'literary' novel. It's part historical novel, part spy thriller, executed with exceptional flair. Boyd is an extremely talented writer and this book surpasses even his previous excellent work.<br /><br />I highly recommend \\"Restless\\".
0671799320|5.0|I just finished the Prize after 4 months and it was a great read. The chapters on WWII were outstanding. What America wouldn't give to be back in the days of $40 barrel of oil again! I now have a greater understanding of the Middle East and the history of politics there. Highly recommend this well deserving Pulitzer winner.
B0015KO52S|5.0|In my opinion, this band is about as good as it gets.  This album starts with two rocken tunes and then simply continues down a well written and very enjoyable musical path.  While I like some songs better than others, as a whole I belive the album is more enjoyable than their first.  I don't understand why more people are not simply fanatical about these guys.    My favorite songs =   These stones will shout  Carolina Drama  Old Enough  Top Yourself
B0014Z4OQG|5.0|All of the kaiju movies we have ever seen, you never got to see the monster attacks fully from the persons point of view...until now. I loved this movie when it was out in theaters and I loved this movie on DVD. It is a Blair Witch with Godzilla thrown in, but what is wrong with that? The movie is supposed to be a monster attack that is seen through the eyes of people who are there, and that is what you get. It is nothing more or nothing less, but it is still fun. When is the last time you have seen Godzilla up close and personal? Never.<br /><br />That is not to attack the Godzilla series, because they are awesome movies, but this breathes life into a genre that has pretty much been by the book every film. This offers something different. If you love monster movies, then this is for you because you go through the experience. If you hate kaiju monster movies, don't watch this. That is all this movie is, which is why so many are disappointed. What were you expecting?
B0011KQSZ4|1.0|Maybe if you are young enough and shallow enough you may find this entertaining. However, if you have ever had to attend the funeral of a loved one you will probably find this very tasteless.

B001453LSI|5.0|What an amazing voice!  Melody Gardot is one of the best singer/songwriters to come around in a LONG time.  Her voice and tone are incredibly sultry and completely engaging.  She deserves to have a long successful career in music!
B000P6YNSE|5.0|Fantastic series, the only problem that I had with the 3rd season of Lost was that it was so compelling to watch, I now have withdrawals and can't wait to get Season 4.
B000WAEK0E|5.0|Still on Top:Greatest Hits was originally released back in 2007 as a single disc 21 track set.  For the more casual fan, it is still IMO the best option to get.<br /><br />Now in 2008, Van Morrison has seen fit to re-release this set as an expanded 3 disc set with the same title. All of the 21 tracks from the single disc version are here but with the addition of 30 more tremendous tracks.  While most die hard Van Morrison fans scoff at the idea of trying to distill his artistry to a compliation of sorts, this new 3 disc set represents the best option for people wanting to dig a lot deeper than the single disc version without having to buy individual albums.<br /><br />The good part here is that all of the tracks are brilliantly remastered and each CD is almost maxed out close to 80 minutes. Disc One is just shy of 78 minutes, disc two is about 78 1/2 minutes and Disc Three is just shy of 79 minutes.  One of my huge gripes when buying greatest hits CD's or anthologies is when they fail to max out the CD (or CD's) as much as they can to 80 minutes. Thankfully they didn't do that here and gave the buyer the absolute most music possible on 3 CD's.<br /><br />The one thing I thought I would have a problem with is that the CD's aren't sequenced in chronological order. But upon listening to the set it's clear that Van Morrison sequenced each CD with a particular feel/mood in mind. This is most evident on Disc 3 which is very laid back and chilled out in a most relaxing and enjoyable way.<br /><br />While there have been way too many compilation sets of Van Morrison's stuff over the years, I feel that this is the best one to get for people wanting a really thorough anthology of this legendary artist's long, long career.<br /><br />For the more casual fan, the 2007 single disc set is still the best option for those seeking more of a lighter sampling of his work.
B0000041DF|4.0|When it comes to playing at breakneck speed, no one runs the show better than Argerich. Even when the public's taste for technical showmanship is more voracious than ever, Argerich is able to satiate even the most greedy and lustful. Combine this with the Rachmaninov's 3rd, considered the most difficult concerto in the standard repertory and you have blinding fireworks. But never for a second think this is purely about show. Argerich captures the volcanic flow and painfully passionate arc crystallised by Rachmaninov's pen; she just does it at an exhilarating pace. Whilst most purists and academics will turn their noses up at this performance, they miss the point because they are too concerned with the 'standard' way of performance. They should put their bookish smarts away and bask in the pure caprice and romanticism that flows from Argerich's soul, whose musical instincts and phenomenal technique allows her to do whatever she pleases with the music. And what a result!
0452289963|5.0|I've had the opportunity to review several of the chapters of book.  His words are powerful and the book is an excellent page turner.  It helps address some of life's most important and troubling questions and concerns.  In essence, the book mirror's \\"the here and now\\" and provides a reality check for those who got lost in the translation of life.  One of his most important statements points out that we must live in the present and let go of the past because it can't be changed.  Out of the number of self-improvement and inspirational books I've read, I highly recommend buying this book and use it as a daily life reference guide.
B000N6TYLW|5.0|This season is just wonderful! I was a little disappointed in the ending, just because it was the end of the series, and I was expecting a little more. But it is still a must see!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is an outstanding serices that I have found useful as a supplemental resource recommended for environmental science and geography courses.
B000F8O35U|5.0|This movie is a lot of fun, and definitely ranks right up there with older Disney \\"classic\\" films such as Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, and Cinderella.  The folks at Disney did take some creative license with the tale (in the original the mermaid does NOT end up with the prince!), but you can forgive them for that.  :)  Ursula is a delightful villian; the music is terrific; the story is charming.  Buy this one!
B00000DCHI|5.0|One of the best of our time, just a great library of music and one heck of a good man.  So many songs and his writing, words and music tell so many stories and in this collection has it all and can listen to it often from cover to cover. Another unique talent that we have yet to see anyone upcoming of similar talent.

0671449028|5.0|Cute bedtime book!  My child liked it, but we lost it while traveling already :(  I'll have to pick up another copy sometime.
0805079831|5.0|This book is an eye-opener and provides a treasure of information about modern social-economic history since the 1950's. The book is extremely well researched and the author explains her vision on the tensions between  social democracy and free market capitalism; the role of American imperialism during the past 50th years and disastrous  consequences that it had for millions of people around the world. Although I perceived the book as consistent and well formulated, I also heard comments that some of the arguments are flawed. With almost 600 pages, it is a real challenge to read the book cover-to-cover : nevertheless, I found every chapter very rich in information and satisfying to read.  Definitely recommended.
B0010X73ZG|4.0|Even my husband liked this one, and he's not a fan of horror movies. We both enjoyed/were disturbed by the movie.<br /><br />Horror is my favorite genre, and my husband's least favorite. I like horror because it's a short getaway from reality, but this movie isn't strictly horror. There are many psychological aspects in this movie, and those are close enough to reality to make it a little disturbing.<br /><br />Yes, there are \\"monsters in the mist\\" in the movie. The monsters are the fun part. The disturbing, and very thought-provoking, part was normal society completely breaking down in the wake of a catastrophe. Perhaps Mr. King was trying to make a point there. Even if he wasn't, it gave me and my husband a lively topic of conversation.<br /><br />I'd highly recommend this movie to any fans of horror or psychological thrillers.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|If you like the sg1 team, you will love this movie. In the special features, there is an interview with the cast that is both humerous and indearing.
B0013FDM7E|3.0|Will Smith is a very good actor. The special effects and acting in this movie are first-rate. The CGI ruined it for me. Compare this movie with \\"28 Days\\", which had human actors, and which is far scarier. All I kept thinking of was the CGI and that is not good. Someone compared it to the mummies in \\"The Mummy\\". Exactly. And for the same reason, I can't really recommend it.

B00005QZWJ|5.0|This disc is a wonderful selection of pieces from the original score to the film, arranged very nicely so that one piece flows into the next smoothly.    I highly recommend listening whilst working; you sort of drift along with the music, vivid images of Middle Earth popping into your head now and then. It is a very nice soundtrack all in all; atmospheric at times, symphonic at others.
B000FIMHJ4|5.0|I only wanted two songs on this album Love on the Rocks and Livin for the Minute, but what a fantastic surprise the other tracks were. And for those of you that love interviews with bands, there is a fantastic surprise in store with a ten minute interview with all four members of the band; Bret, CC, Bobby and Rikki.<br />Every track on this album will have you singing and yes even playing the air guitar.<br />I play this CD in the car and just open the sun roof and let the windows down and sing a duet with Bret, and it makes my day!! Hail to the KINGS OF ROCK N ROLL
B000ZOXDFA|5.0|This is very well done there are some great reviews on here but I do have one complaint and there is something Historically In-accurant and that is Elizabeth was a Protestant and did not seek Oricals and seek the stars for direction, she prayed to God, other than that the movie was very well done.<br /><br />Enjoy the first one and this second one WONDEFUL!!

So anyway i invite you to see this movie is GREAT.
B00005LC1H|5.0|John Cleese has got to be one of the funniest men alive. His creation, \\"Fawlty Towers\\", was the perfect outlet for his unique humor. The only problem is he only made 12 episodes. The bonus extras do an adequate job of background on both the series and the characters. I wish they had done more. If you are a John Cleese fan this is a must for your video library.
B000EHRVP6|5.0|As you can see by my title, I ran across quite a lot of complaints about this movie before I watched it. \\"It had a bad plot,\\" people said. \\"It was porn for the first 40 minutes, and its transition into gore was really sudden.\\" \\"The acting was bad,\\" \\"the directing was terrible\\", \\"the story sucked\\", etc., etc.    When I watched it I was very pleasantly surprised to find that all these complaints were wrong. Sure, some of them were based on truths, but I think people distorted them simply because they didn't like the premise. Yes, the first 20-30 (NOT 40) minutes of the film had quite a lot of nudity in it, but it was by no means porn! And though I'm not a great fan of mindless sex, at least it wasn't pointless. The sex is what lured the main characters into the hostel in the first place. And the transition into the gore was not sudden, but quite easily handled--in fact, I'm surprised at the wonderful job that Eli Roth did at transforming the mood from light and flippant into dark and unfathomably disturbing.    The acting was by no means bad. Jay Hernandez, I believe, did a spectacular job as Paxton. It is fascinating to watch Paxton's character change from a carefree college student obsessed with sex and girls to a troubled man that delights in vengeance against his torturers. The other actors did their job well (though Derek Richardson as Josh, while mostly skillful, needed to work on his whimpering).    Now for the story. As you all should know, it's about three college-age men that backpack across Europe looking for sex, and they're recommended to a hostel, which turns out to be a place that people get tortured (seriously, the plot is better than I made it sound). Eli Roth didn't add many fancy or unexpected twists into his screenplay; you won't see the kind of surprise endings that the Saw franchise is famous for. But everything Eli Roth does have in here he made sense of. He uses very little unnecessary material, and he does a great job at subtle foreshadowing so that, in the end, everything makes sense. Please pay attention to the scene where Paxton tells Josh about a childhood memory of watching a girl die, because it foreshadows what would have otherwise been a really dumb (er, I mean Gryffindorish) moment in the script.    I also loved the fact that Eli Roth and the sound editors didn't splurge on the screams. In fact, when the screams get particularly loud, the editors actually turned them down and instead increased the other noises (such as the chainsaws or, most memorably, the snapping of sharp scissors). You can't know just how pleased I was that they didn't blast me from my seat with 100,000 decibels of pure sound.    I also loved the score, which moved away from the overly-creepy style of horror films and more towards the dramatic form. It suited the film better, because this film was really not scary. However, it was truly disturbing and horrific (hence the term \\"horror film\\"). It is dumbfounding to witness this appalling display of human brutality and its marked effect on the characters (namely Paxton--he has an absolutely haunting terror in his eyes during the last half-hour of the movie). This brutality is made all the more effective by Roth's refusal to use the safer, less inciting \\"cut-to-black\\" techniques found in cheap horror films. No, he shows us everything. In great, bloody detail. And it is gross.    The trailer said the movie was based off true events. I'm guessing it probably meant the premise as opposed to the actual characters, but either way it's entirely believable. Humans are cruel creatures, and they go to insane lengths to continue in their destructive depravity. It was Roth's effectiveness in conveying this theme that made me give this movie a 5-star instead of a 4.    This movie is a must-see for horror fans, or for MATURE viewers. If you cannot see past the gore, you should probably not watch this movie. If you can, however, you need to watch this at least once (more, if you can stomach it), despite the side effects of a churned stomach and a severe jolting of the emotions and senses.
B000WBZ5M0|5.0|The previous Oceans (11 & 12) were good, but I liked this one....it's really much fun than the others.
1559408855|5.0|I watched this film late one night (after my parents were in bed), and for a while it was merely uncomfortable to sit through. The actors weren't particularly emotional, the sets weren't hugely exciting, and the storyline consisted of four libertines and their accomplices listening to dirty stories and doing dirty things to their child victims.<br /><br />And yet, halfway through this blas&eacute; piece, I began crying. It was, I believe, at a part where the whore was telling one her sick stories while dancing with the libertine, and she begins laughing as if it is the funniest thing in the world. And yet the laugh sounds false--not just false, but hopeless. I cried off and on (though more on than off) the rest of the film, and from now on I cannot think about \\"Salo\\" without tearing up; I am trying not to cry even as I write this.<br /><br />What makes \\"Salo\\" the most disturbing film I have ever watched, no competition? It is not the acts depicted--the coprophilia, the torture, the murder, the betrayal. It is that supreme and utter hopelessness behind the whore's laugh. It is the insatiable desires of the libertines, constantly fed and yet never quenched. It is the victims who are willing to sell each other out in order to escape just a little bit more torture before their inevitable death.<br /><br />The novel described the four libertines as being people who not only did as much evil as they possibly could, but also as people who went out of their way to avoid doing anything virtuous. Pier Paolo Pasolini has extended this bleak outlook to the entire human race. The entire film is soaked with his utter hatred and disgust for humanity--nobody in this film has a redeeming side, not even the victims. Everyone in this film is going to die--even the libertines, sometime after the film comes to its conclusion, are going to be tried for war crimes as part of the Fascist regime. Pasolini paints a portrait of the human race as a race that is wallowing in the lowest depths of misery as it drags itself towards its own demise.<br /><br />There is no moral to this story. Pasolini figures that the human race will merely ignore the moral if he tries to give one. Neither does he try to spruce up this film with interesting acting or camera-work. The direction is bland and the cinematography is largely static--and therein lies its greatest (or is it its worst?) talent. It is as if Pasolini is looking up at the human race from behind the camera, his face gaunt and hopeless, considering the various ways to spice up the scene before saying: \\"Why bother? You are worthless; this film will not satisfy your desires, whatever they may be.\\"<br /><br />Which leads me to one last question: how the heck did I give this 10 stars? And how the heck can I possibly recommend it to any of you? It was upsetting, disturbing, and appalling. And yet it has changed my life--for the better? For the worse? Does is crush my hopes for humanity, or does it give me an understanding of its darkest facets and how best to avoid them? Look, people, I don't rightly know! I'm still figuring it out!<br /><br />To most of you: stay the heck away from this film. But to a few of you--a very, very few--those few that want to see this movie for more than its shock value, those few that are willing to explore humanity's darkest recesses, those few that are not mainstream moviegoers and are actually willing to think--I recommend, no I BEG you to watch \\"Salo, or the 120 Days of Sodom.\\" You will never forget it.wards its own demise.

0307265730|5.0|Finishing this collection of carefully wrought and longish short stories was bittersweet. Lahari is a master of character study, and it's difficult to believe she's still a young woman. Her descriptions of her multigenerational, mostly Bengali immigrant, characters felt intimate and usually sympathetic. The details may be Indian, but the emotions are universal. I can't think of any writer today who can so closely render the complicated interactions of adults and their offspring.    Two things are remarkable about these stories. One is the way she moves around from one point of view to another quite easily so that we see a situation from the standpoints of several characters. Lahiri switches smoothly in and out of various perspectives until she has rendered a little gem of a tale.     The second remarkable characteristic is the way she ends a story. It's not the classic O Henry ending where there's a twist that catches you by surprise and may not make sense entirely but what I think of now as a Lahiri ending, a devastating insight that takes your breath away. There's not an unsatisfying conclusion in any of the eight stories that make up this collection.
B000N6TYLW|5.0|I love the Gilmore Girls.  Each season is filled with humor and fun.  This was a fitting end to 7 years with the mother and daughter duo.  I also enjoyed the special interest chapters at the end, talked about the ever changing and evolving wardrobe or Loralei and Rory and several other fun blurbs.
0143038419|5.0|I still have a few pages left of the book, and wish it didn't have to end.  Each section I read; Italy, India and now Bali - seemed better than the last.  If you are on a soul search of any level, you will greatly enjoy this book.  It is not preachy or far-out, it IS written with an open heart and mind.  May you enjoy it as much as I have!
0451208706|5.0|This is what I want in a novel! I learned quite a bit about a \\"slice\\" of history that I knew very little about before: primarily London just before WW1 and, to a lesser extent, a sample of heinous cruelty delegated by many of the Russian 'nobility' (1895). For readers who prefer to sort of whet their appetites before diving into extensive historical studies, this presents the best of both worlds-a history primer entwined with one of the most suspenseful & captivating novels!
0786890754|5.0|So happy I had not seen the movie before reading the book.  Immediately I was drawn into the story.  I loved every minute of the book and finished it in 2 days.  Cecelia writes great stories about strong women I couldn't wait to pass it onto someone else to read.  Keep writing Cecelia.
B0002Y4TOM|5.0|I WAS EXCIDED TO WATCH A TV PROGRAM THAT IS FAMILY ORIENTED. I CAN RELATE TO THE MOTHER, DAUGHTER RELATIONSHIP. AND, MY SON AND I ARE VERY CLOSE. I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO SEASON 3, NEXT. I HAVE VERY LITTLE TIME TO WATCH TV. SO I LOOK FORWARD TO WATCHING THE GILMORE GIRLS.<br /><br />THANKS<br />GLORIA BLADES
0786890762|5.0|I just finished PS I Love You and someone recommended this book.  I was immediately drawn to read the book and stayed up way too late to finish the next day.  It is uniquely written as correspondence between the characters, very easy to follow.  Rosie and Alex are wonderful characters you can't stop reading.  I laughed and cried, just loved the whole story.  Thank you Cecelia.
B000O77SOK|5.0|THE PRACTICE:<br /><br />This is ensemble acting at it's best ! Each character has the opportunity to 'shine'. Every mamber of the cast falls smack into the 'heavy hitter' category. There is no hint of 'I'M THE STAR' and the supporting cast are merely there to decorate the room whilst I say my lines !!<br /><br />It is PLOT DRIVEN - no car chases here, just superlative dialogue perfectly delivered by highly talented actors, at the top of their profession.<br /><br />The plot lines are sharp, edgy, atmosphereic,(sometimes truly chilling, even dark - not for the faint hearted). In short 'The Practice' is what television drama SHOULD be, and COULD be, but seldom is.<br /><br />ABSOLUTELY COMPELLING !!<br /><br />With thanks to all who created it...<br />Michelle Williams<br />(wife of Jeff !! who has also become a fan of The Practice )
B000PC6Z48|5.0|This is a magnificent example of the spaghetti western genre. Dark, moody and mystical, as are the better films of this type. The Leone/Eastwood films remain the standard, but DJANGO is one heck of a cool film. Sergio Corbucci's direction and Franco Nero's performance combine to make this a true Euro-Western classic. Blue Underground's presentation is beautifully done, and they have included the option of viewing the film with the original Italian soundtrack, which is definitely the way to go for this one. They have also included a nice little \\"Uovo di Pasqua\\" on the Special Features menu page (hint: Django's coffin). If you like the \\"Dollars\\" trilogy ([[ASIN:B000OPOAMU The Sergio Leone Anthology (A Fistful Of Dollars / For A Few Dollars More / The Good, The Bad And The Ugly / Duck, You Sucker)]]) then DJANGO is a must-have!
B000AYEL1A|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie.  The love story is very touching and the music is awesome.  It is a wonderful remake of a classic movie.
0790734850|1.0|I cannot stress enough to avoid this movie like the plague.  I used to think it was a masterful piece of cinema.  Then I read the book and everything changed.  My problems with this movie are the same as any other Ellroy book to movie adaptations - stories and characters are rewritten without any consideration for how it affects the overall piece, casting is done without reading the characters descriptions, and the angst and misery of the main characters is never properly conveyed.  Hopefully White Jazz can break the cycle, though I have very little hope.
B00007L4OM|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie, and have been looking for the soundtrack for years!  Will say this though--it's better to watch with the subtitles, with the original actors' voices.  Jean Reno does his voice in the dubbed version though so if all you can find is the dubbed version, it's still a great movie.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This DVD quickly became my favorite workout!! i love the different levels or difficulty, and the moves were new and different! i was even sore the first few times! highly recommend this dvd!
B000AOEMXM|5.0|Item was well priced, and shipping was done quickly and at a reasonable cost...I HIGHLY recommend this seller!!!
B000FA57US|5.0|I would have to say the Halloween 5 and The curse of Michael Myers are the worst of the bunch. and as a lot of Halloween fans will say \\"halloween 3 does not count\\". That being said, I would say I enjoyed the directors commentary of Halloween 5 because it gave the director a chance to defend his choices of why he did what he did. I think it's much better than sitting through the whole movie wondering \\"why did they do something stupid like that\\". I dont agree with most of his choices but at least I understand his mind set a little better. Besides, hardcore halloween fans have to buy every Michael Myers related offering anyway so why should this one be any different than the twelve copies of the original Halloween we buy just because it comes in a different style case?
1582701709|2.0|THE SECRET by Rhonda Byrne was recommended to me by a friend. It is one of those books I've browsed, but have found lacking in substance. Each person who picks up a book offering a new way of seeing and enhancing their life is hoping for something.<br />I'm going to quote this sentence: \\"You want to become aware of how you're feeling, and get in tune with how you're feeling, because it is the fastest way for you to know what you're thinking.\\" I've yet to figure out what is being convey.<br />Feelings are barometer's, which convey to us whether a situation is good or bad for us, nothing more. They are not tools of cognition, the ability to use it can be damaged by allowing emotions to cloud the issue at hand.<br />This is the lowest mark I've ever given in a review, but I found the text filled with more double talk than a presidential campaign leading to a famous line, \\"full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.\\"<br />I'm also glad my friend doesn't own a computer, I would not want to hurt her feelings by letting her know what I think of the volume.<br />Nash Black, author of WRITING AS A SMALL BUSINESS and SINS OF THE FATHERS.
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|I just watched Cloverfield. I'm not saying it's the worst movie I have ever seen, but I can't remember when I hated one more.  Why the film makers thought it was a innovation to film it with a hand held camcorder(BLAIR WITCH PROJECT) is beyond me.  But, I guess my main objection is one of us isn't \\"getting it\\".   In the \\"monster\\" movies of the past, there was a reason. Atomic bomb, bad experiments, etc. etc.. In this movie, there are no why's, from where(?) and how come.  Also, is it a law that only stupid people can be in the modern horror movies. You know, the ones who go back for cat, or piece of jewelery or something insignificent worth risking your life for.  One other final note. The movie is 83 mins.( way to long), but 11 mins are the credits.  I wonder if people would flocked to the theaters or rent the movie if they're told the truth. \\"This movie was shot on a camcorder, you hardly ever see the monster, you get to watch a bunch of stupid people run around NY for 72 mins.\\"
0517548232|4.0|This book is useful for teaching lower division undergraduate students the principles of microeconomics.It can be used as a supplementary book.Hazlitt emphasizes the important concept of opportunity cost,but neglects to incorporate any discussion of spillover effects and externalities(positive and negative,depletable and undepletable),market failure,public goods,the theory of second best,adverse selection,moral hazard, the principal-agent problem,etc.It is interesting that all these missing  topics were originally covered by Adam Smith in The Wealth of Nations(1776),especially in Part V.
0060775858|5.0|Initially, I would have rated this book a one star but after reading reviews of others who had children before, I decided to give the book a chance.  I learned that the repetition of this book is a teaching tool and realized that as I began to read the book to my infant a couple months ago.  As time goes by, she is beginning to recognize the common objects in the pictures that she sees in our home.  I love the way the room darkens as it is getting closer to bed time.  The illustrations are beautiful and the other objects drawn in the \\"great green room\\" were carefully thought out by the illustrator. The simplicity of the home environment gives the reader a feeling of warmth and security.  Yes, the simple words will eventually get boring to an adult, but to a baby/child with limited vocabulary, it is perfect.
0143038419|5.0|I didn't want to read this book considering it was one of Oprah's books of the month.  After a few pages I was hooked.  I found her self depricating humor to be light hearted.  This is not a slef-help book, and if it is seen as so, that one would be mistaken.  She found what worked for her, what was best for her, and cannot be faulted for that.
B000P12LWY|5.0|Basicly, this is a soap opera set in the 1500's! Addictive and intrueging!   I have to say I was transfixed by this box set! Not just because of the beautiful people (though there are LOTS of them!) but because the storyline is just so addictive! Also, knowing that it is based on true historical events, it sparked my imagination, making me want to learn more about the people, places and events, to find out what was fact and what was fiction! I loved it and I'll definatly be buying any seasons that follow!    A small word of caution though, if you are offended by scenes of a sexual nature, don't buy this! There is A LOT of sex in it but it's all pertinant and integral to the storyline. I personaly was not offended and felt that the story would have suffered if those scenes were eliminmated.
B00005N6KG|4.0|This is an old model from Sony, though they still compete well enough with newer models that cost up to four times as much. My previous pair of the MDR-W08L lasted nearly five years before the wires became worn in the casing.     The price is a bargain for the quality of sound these headphones consistently deliver. Furthermore, they allow for a slight amount of natural sound to enter the ears, thus allowing for safety while running, biking, subway travel, etc.
B000NVIXFK|4.0|I am a relatively new Rush fan.  I always liked them but developed a new appreciation for them in the past few years.  I bought this CD at a show after hearing the new stuff live.  The song that got me live was \\"Armor and Sword.\\"  I really liked the lyrics a lot and they have significant meaning to me in my life right now.  I very much enjoyed this album, more than I expected.  But I kept hoping to hear some fantastic piece of drum work or a guitar riff that just made me say \\"Whoa!\\"  I think it might be the mixing--everything is kind of kept at the same level so that there's not as much dynamics as I would hope.  However, in no way is the musicianship lacking. I will say that the more you listen to it, the more you like it.  I find the lyrics, though not as profound as yesteryear's, are so appropriate for the troubled times we live in now.  Overall, the album was very listenable and I would highly recommend it.
B0013FXWU6|3.0|I'll start off by saying that I found this film more engrossing than it's Best Picture rival No Country For Old Men, and that Daniel Day-Lewis is one of the greatest actors of our generation.  When he plays a role, HE IS the role.  I just love the way he pulls off that early 20th century look with the hairstyle, the mustache, and the trousers.  Truly amazing, he pulls it off to perfection.  The characters, the setting, and the scenery were quite exceptional and enjoyable.  The only reason TWBB is better for me than NCFOM is simply because there is much better acting and dialogue in this film hands down.  The film is also a period piece and helps the viewer relate a bit better to the characters and what type of environment they have around them.  For example, the scene where the supposed brother of Daniel Plainview is waiting by his house.  I think we all know who it is and why he's there even before he properly introduces himself to Daniel.  The man is dirt poor, and Daniel has just struck it rich.  Whether it was his brother, a relative, or an old friend, you know exactly that the both of them shared a past and that they are both meeting not by chance, but for opportunity.<br /><br />However in my honest opinion, both these afformentioned films don't seem to have a clear and decisive plot and above all else, a satisfactory conclusion to the story.  As excited as I was to see the great Daniel Day-Lewis on screen again, I cannot say the same for the film which is quite slow at times in delivering a particular scene and leaves you with an empty feeling afterwards.  The only true satisfaction I got (regarding the story) was finally seeing H.W. Plainview release himself from his father's control on his life.  It is a painful scene, but it's brilliant and was long overdue in the film.  The dialouge between characters was great, especially the lack of actual spoken dialogue between Daniel and his son towards the end of the film.  The grimaces, the smiles, the sarcasm, and the stares between Daniel and Eli Sunday were striking.<br /><br />Aside from all that, it pains me to say this, but again, I think the book and the film take another stab at God and at organized religion.  Now I may be reading too much into that, but when you think about it, most of the movie deals with God, religion, salvation, and conscience.  As a semi-religous person myself, I did not find a problem with the stab, I just found a problem with who in the end was right and who in the end was wrong.  Both characters when you look at it were villains.  Despicable people truly void of God or a conscience.  Eli was a self-righteous preacher who was in it for the money.  Daniel was an egotistical maniac who was in it for the money, the power, and the glory.  Not to mention he plays a horrible father figure to H.W.  So at the end of the film, are we to take away that a bigger ego defeated a smaller one, or that capitalism, greed, and self-righteousness conquers over God?  The ending leaves too much to be desired and doesn't present a strong enough conclusion to both protagonists.<br /><br />While I think it was merely a coincidence that NCFOM and TWBB were filmed in the same fashion, my only hope is that future films with such great capacity can successfully have a proper conclusion to the story and can no longer void itself of complete justice towards sociopathic villians like Daniel Plainview and Anton Chigurh.res between Daniel and Eli Sunday were striking.

B0014CDKVY|1.0|I love Will Smith and I went into this movie BIAS, expecting this movie to be good like a majority of the movies he has been in.    I was so disappointed!!!!!!! The storyline sucked, the graphics were horrible, and it was so predictable!
6305736650|5.0|As usual, Bogey is at his top performance in this one! Worth every cent it cost.
B0013TO3HS|5.0|I loved this movie! Beautiful graphics! Fun storyline!    I think people just analyze too much into a fantasy. We (me and three other people who went) expected nothing more than a fairy tale going into it. Which was what we got.      The only setback was that it kind of left you hanging for the sequel, but it's still worth it to watch despite the cliff hanger.    I think some of the content was more adult aimed, like the steam based engineering and analogies behind the government. But I'm sure kids would enjoy it anyway because of the animation.    But, a story is a story and I'd buy this one to keep just because it's exactly that.. a cool story.
B00007BH5C|2.0|Orchestral music enthusiasts who enjoy cinematic scores will, predictably, enjoy Howard Shore's composition for The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers and the other scores in this series as well. Of the three CDs, The Two Towers does I think show us the greatest range of Shore's thematic elements used in the eponymous movies. This CD is comprised of music incidental to scenes set in Rohan, Fangorn's Forest, and the approaches to Mordor, but it is the Meduseld/Theoden themes that \\"stay with you\\" well after the soundtrack ends.    The CD does, however, have a major presentation flaw. When played in a computer, there is an autostart web-link that impedes listening. You have to work around the web link in order to merely play the music. The link is nothing other than a garden variety in your face advertisement, and a solicitiation to join their website and otherwise provide them with information that will presumedly be used as an excuse to annoy you with MORE advertising.
B0000DBJDM|1.0|Hey, Pink   I hope I am not being presumptuous by using your first name, but familiarity seems appropriate in this case. I have a question for you. Exactly what were you trying to prove in Pink Floyd: Live at Pompeii? I have been to Pompeii. I have been to the mountaintop of Vesuvius. The souls of those who died in the volcanic eruption one millennium, nine centuries, one score and five years ago heard your performance and they are groaning.   You were given four pieces of electronic equipment and told to do something with them. The implication was that you were going to do something musical with them. What you concocted was a piece of work that only someone savoring the effects of an ecstasy-marijuana-crack cocktail could begin to understand.   Pink, that was not music. Count Basie was music. Frank Sinatra was music.  The Beatles were music. Pavorotti looks like music. The Miracles and the Temptations were real music. Aretha Franklin defines music. What you presented will probably cause Vesuvius to come to life again.   You are beginning to make me think that Camille Paglia was correct when she said rock musicians should be forced to have classical training before they are allowed to create their own art. I will take it one step further. I say artists such as Pink Floyd should be forced to sit at the feet of the classical artists to learn a thing or two. Since the classical artists are all dead, that will solve the problem.   Pink, I suggest you relinquish your rights to the name. You are an insult to all that is pink. Even the panther is having second thoughts about being associated with the color.    Sincerely      Loup
B0010YSD7M|4.0|Finally, the Ori saga is complete.  Taking place where the series ended and completing the 2 year fight with the Ori, The Ark of Truth is a grand conclusion to one of the best series ever made. It is a fast, thrilling feature length film that complements what has come before without making to too complex. Without giving away too many details, this finishes what season 9 -10 was building to and gives it a grand finale.  A wonderful bonus for new comers ... or those that have wandered away from the series in earlier seasons, it comes complete with a featurette, SG-1: The Road Taken, which catches anyone up for the orginal movie. I recommend everyone watch it before seeing Ark of Truth.  This movie is the best of SG-1, condensed into movie form, with loads of special effects the series couldn't afford.  Any scifi fan will love this. Enjoy!!

B000EWBKKI|5.0|Terminator 2 is arguably Schwarzenegger's most famous role, and the plot by now is fairly well known.  In the original Terminator, Schwarzenegger had been sent back to kill Sarah Connor before she could give birth to her son, John Connor, who would destory SkyNet in the future.  The plan goes awry when Kyle Reese not only sucessfully protects Sarah, but fathers John.  In Terminator 2, SkyNet tries again, this time with Schwarzenegger's Terminator character playing the role of protector.<br /><br />Considering that this film was made in the early 90's, I was astounded by the quality of the transfer.  Do note that this does not have any of the deleted scenes or such from the (many) DVD versions -- but nevertheless, the image and audio quality was superb, and an excellent polish to a great film.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I used to be one of those skinny girls who could eat whatever and not exercise and never gain weight...well that ended in my 30's and all the bad habits I developed caused me to gain 40 lbs. over five years.  I struggled to lose it because I didn't work hard enough, always looked for the easy way out, the magic pill if you will.  Well, I'm here to tell you there is no easy way out and no magic pill, if you want to lose the weight you need to work for it.  This DVD is so great, all the exercises are easy enough that you don't have to keep your eye on the tv to see how to do it, but, it will kick your butt!  I'm on my second week and I still get sore becasue I push myself as Jillian tells you to.  I have lost the weight and now I'm toning and getting stronger everyday!  I see my body changing rapidly now and I'm actually looking forward to putting on a bikini!  If you are serious about getting in shape and losing the weight get this DVD!!!
B00177Y9ZM|4.0|I went to see Jumper  with some of my family when it was released, and I have to say I enjoyed it very much. I've liked Hayden Christensen since I saw \\"Life as a House,\\" and Samuel L. just rips up a villain role like nobody's business. The special effects were very well done and I was delighted to find that the main storyline they implied in the commercials is NOT what happened! Sure, the main character can teleport, but the rest.... The movie is billed as scifi/thriller type, but that's a bit misleading. This is more like the Highlander films, a fantasy element in the real world.<br /><br />The movie was pretty fast paced with only a couple slower moments, and the character's self-exploration once he discovers the ability was almost as good as Peter Parker's in the first Spider-Man movie. Actually, in one way it was better. Peter uses his power to win a wrestling match and then jumps right into the hero role. Our similarly-aged jumper, however, jumps right into a bank vault, and a store, and...! *grin* He really is an ordinary person with an extraordinary ability.  He used his ability for theft, but also for taking his surfboard to Fiji for the best waves.  I liked the movie enough that I quickly ordered the book.  They are COMPLETELY different, but both good for different reasons.  The movie added a opposing force for jumpers (i.e. a \\"villain\\") whereas in the book, David mostly battles his own inner demons (with a lot of introspection).  Plus, the very cool character of Griffin was completely made-up for the film.  His character adds great action while giving viewers another jumper to identify with besides David.  Though the movie had closure, they left it wide open for a sequel that I really hope gets made.<br /><br />I think some viewers were overly critical of this film.  It's not going to win any oscars, but I was entertained and that's the most important criteria.<br /><br />As to the DVD itself, I have to say, do NOT buy the 2-disc edition.  The second disk contains only a digital copy.  All the extras are on disc one, which the regular edition has!  I really wish the product description had been more clear on this.  I wouldn't have paid the additional $6 for a digital copy which you have to use a keycode to transfer.  The code is located on a card in the case, but it clearly states to be careful not to lose it.  Also, the outer sleeve has a holographic image of the cover art that is glued to the front of the sleeve.  I don't see it lasting long.  Finally, once again the studio includes ads in the case, but no insert with chapter index and extra features.<br /><br />The extra features were pretty standard.  There's commentary, making of, interviews with the authors/producer etc, book to film featurette, and some deleted scenes (all of which I felt were rightly cut from the film).  The interviews were interesting sinc ethey touched on how the producer obviously changed the book, and how the author felt.  Nothing spectacular here, but for a single disc edition these were perfectly fine - and far more than they offered with \\"the Bourne Ultimatium\\".copy.

0307387178|3.0|The story drew me in, as it probably does to many. In the end, the unanswered questions are what kept me from giving this book a better rating. I understand that there are a lot of conjectures about McCandless, and that they can't be answered because he is dead, but that doesn't make me any less disappointed.<br /><br />I think that Krakauer did a decent job of telling McCandless's story, and I agree with many of the conclusions he came to. The only real issue I had with this book was that it seemed to have a lot of \\"filler pages\\". Krakauer would spend pages and pages talking about one theory, only to turn around and refute it with what he actually believed happened. To me, when he did this it felt as if he was just trying to make the book longer and not actually presenting any worthwhile information.
B0000009RX|5.0|Still my favorite Mothers of Invention album, this \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" send up is full of satire and good tunes at the same time.  Their third album and with a fleshed out group of musicians, this is Zappa at his finest.  Recommended for all Zappa fans!
B0011ZNAIC|3.0|This was a great movie for the kids, which is exactly why we got it.  The connection between bees and pollen and the collapse of the economy is greatly oversimplified, but the animation is great and the jokes are funny.  As long as you are prepared to explain how pollenation really works, you should be O.K.
B0000009RT|4.0|This first from Frank Zappa's Mothers of Invention is a slick yet primative piece of work.  I first heard this when I was about 14; the new digital recording does the piece well.  It's all a done in a satirical way but it holds up well.  Recommended for Zappa fans as a period piece.
B000IOM1YQ|3.0|I've never owned a version of this album until now, so I don't have a clue if this is an improvement regarding the audio. I have been a fan of the Alan Parsons Project since I Robot & owned everything through Eye in the Sky. It was about that time, for various reasons, that I quit purchasing albums. Stereotomy managed to get to #43 on the charts. The song \\"Sterotomy\\" made it to #82 on the singles chart.    The Project has always used a rotating group of vocalists but at the core of this were Lenny Zakatek, Chris Rainbow & Eric Woolfson. For the first time on any Project album up to this point there isn't a Zakatek lead vocal. Eric Woolfson doesn't do a lead vocal either for the first time since The Turn of a Friendly Card. This is further evidence that the Project was taking a different tack.    The first thing I noticed with this album is there a definite eighties influence in the music, dance rhythms have been incorporated into the music of APP. Stereotomy isn't a bad album; I know it's not considered to be the best in his catalog, no, not even close, yet there isn't a weak moment in it. Unlike most of the Project's albums this one didn't open with an instrumental. It definitely makes one feel as if the Project was making  a conscious effort to go into another direction. Also, unlike most of the Project's earlier efforts, there isn't a standout song here. The songs that immediately struck me as good were \\"Stereotomy\\", \\"Urbania\\" & \\"Where's the Walrus?\\", the latter two being instrumentals. Instrumentals have been one of the greatest strengths of the Project.    There are four bonus tracks here which show the evolution of some of the songs that are here. One of the bonus cuts is a song that wasn't included on the original album. Let me add one more thing: Ian Bairnson is an excellent guitarist who hasn't received all the credit he's due. He's one of the most tasteful of lead players always giving exactly what the songs required. He's well known in the circle of musicians but the public, in general, doesn't give this man the proper credit. My hats off to you, Ian Bairnson!
0805211063|5.0|I offer the startling proposal that Franz Kafka's The Castle is, after all, about life as it is lived by all of us.<br /><br />The novel is difficult for us \\"post post moderns\\" for several reasons.<br /><br />The first is that the action is set in a time and place which no longer exist:  Prague in the Austro-Hungarian Empire before and possibly during World War I.<br /><br />Kafka's readers were familiar with the social structure and physical description of the village and Castle of his story.  But it is not easy for us to understand the relative rank and relationships between the Count Westwest, the Count's authorities, the villagers, peasants, officials, stewards, substewards, lawyers,  domestics, gentlemen, chairmen, chamber maids, coachmen, school teachers, innkeepers, land surveyors, gentleman's servants, fire chiefs, shoe makers, and so forth.  But we have to form an imaginative relationship with and between all of them so that we can enter into the complex of social and psychological relationships presented in the book.<br /><br />The geography of the village and especially of the Inn, with its corridors, tap room, etc. is presented in vivid detail but is unlike anything we are likely to encounter in modern life, and therefore it seems almost dreamlike even though it was obviously part of Kafka's daily experience and is in no way \\"Kafkaesque.\\"<br /><br />A third difficulty is the extraordinarily dense nature of the story.  The plot of The Castle has been described as simple, and in fact it is simple.  But the story has layers and layers of detailed information that interweave, are clarified and sometimes contradicted by the skein of events, and detailed reactions to the events, that run through 25 chapters.  We need a map of characters and their relationships with each other to separate the planned ambiguities from the unplanned.  Otherwise we quickly become lost in maze of detail, which was not Kafka's intention.<br /><br />A fourth difficulty is the humor.  Humor does not usually travel well, either in time or space.  But whether we get all the jokes or not, it is obvious that The Castle is full of humor, from slapstick and pranks all the way to paradox, the absurd, high irony and self-mockery.  We need to be on the lookout for humor, everywhere.<br /><br />Kafka loved Charlie Chaplin and we should not forget that fact while reading The Castle.  Chaplin's film, The Tramp, opens with tramp walking down a dusty road with a walking stick and a small -- do we dare say \\"rucksack?\\"  I would bet that Kafka was inspired to open The Castle with the same image.  Chaplin's film, A Dog's life, opens with a tramp gazing up at what looks like a castle with a flag flowing over its crest, and I would wager that Kafka's The Castle was influenced by that film and its opening image as well.  To get into the right mood for reading The Castle, I recommend watching both of these silent movies.<br /><br />Ludwig Wittgenstein once said that \\"a serious philosophical work could be written that would consist entirely of jokes.\\"  The Mathematician John Allen Paulos points out a relationship between the humor of Groucho Marx and the philosophical work of Bertrand Russell and George Pitcher in \\"Wittgenstein, Nonsense, and Lewis Carroll\\" shows the same relationship between the humor of Carroll and the philosophy of Wittgenstein.  I propose, for someone else to show with quotations, that Kafka does the same with the thought of the Danish thinker Soren Kierkegaard.  In fact, the entire novel, The Castle, seems to me to be an absurd and often humorous meditation on the famous saying of Kierkegaard \\"Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards.\\"<br /><br />As an example of high irony and self-mockery, one of the characters, Amalia asks K, in response to his professed interest in the Castle,<br /><br />\\"The influence of the castle? ... do you really care about such stories? ... there are people who feed on such stories ... but you do not strike me as one of them.\\"  \\"Yes I am,\\" said K, \\"I am indeed one of them, whereas I am not greatly taken by those who do not concern themselves with such stories and simply make others concern themselves with them.\\"  \\"Well yes,\\" said Amalia, \\"but people are interested in different ways, I once heard of a young man whose mind was taken up day and night with thoughts of the Castle, he neglected everything else, people feared for his ordinary faculty of reason since all his faculties were always up at the  Castle, but in the end it turned out that it wasn't actually the Castle he was thinking of but only the daughter of a scullery maid at the offices, he got her, and then all was fine again.\\"  \\"I would like that man, I think,\\" said K, \\"As for your liking that man,\\" said Amalia, \\"I'm not so sure about that, but you might like his wife.  Now don't let me disturb you, but I am going to bed  ...\\"  p. 205  (All quotes are from the Harman translation published by Shocken Books.)<br /><br />There are many examples of prankish, almost slapstick humor such as the following,<br /><br />\\"Erlanger .. he's known for his memory and for his ability to judge people, he simply knits his brow, that's all it takes for him to recognize anyone, often even people whom he's never seen before, whom he has only heard or read about, and in my case, for instance, he could hardly have seen me before.  But though he recognizes everyone right away, he asks first (who you are) as though he were unsure.\\"<br />p. 238<br /><br />\\"[Brunswick] is actually quite quick.  It's one form his stupidity takes.\\"  p.68<br /><br />\\"So you are merely acquainted with the office furnishings at the Castle?\\" K asked [the chairman] rudely.  \\"Yes,\\" said the chairman, with an ironic and yet grateful smile, \\"they're the most important things about it.\\" p.67<br /><br />\\"... and since the chair stood by the bed they stumbled over it and fell down ...  She sought something and he sought something, in a fury, grimacing, they sought  with their heads boring into each other's [...]; their embraces and arched bodies, far from making them forget, reminded them of their duty to keep searching, like dogs desperately pawing at the earth they pawed at each other's bodies, and then, helpless and disappointed, in an effort to catch one last bit of happiness, their tongues occasionally ran all over each other's faces.  Only weariness made them lie still, and be grateful to each other.  Then the maids came up,  \\"Look at the way they're lying there,\\" one of them said, and out of pity she threw a sheet over them. p. 46<br /><br />Another difficulty that must be overcome is that there are many long speeches where it isn't certain which character is talking.  Sometimes it seems as if an omnipotent narrator is telling the story but then it becomes clear, or we recall, that it is one of the characters presenting his unique point of view of events and people.  Also, it is important never to forget that K (the main character) and the narrator are not the same person (and, of course, that neither is Kafka!)<br /><br />Then there is the planned ambiguity.  For example K has been called to the village by the Castle to be a land surveyor.  But in the first chapter, this is cast into doubt by a telephone call from the Bridge Inn to the Castle, which fails to corroborate this important \\"fact.\\"  A few minutes later, a call comes from the Castle to the Bridge Inn to report that an error has been made and that K was, in fact, called by the Castle to be a land surveyor.<br /><br />It is crucial for understanding the story that we separate the planned confusion from our own confusion that results from not understanding what we are reading.  A typical reader simply concludes that his own confusion and Kafka's planned confusions are the same.<br /><br />The Castle is very complex.  The complexity is impossible to clarify here, obviously, but most of the complexity is not in actions and events, such as Amalia tearing up a piece of paper and throwing it at a messenger, but in the emotions and reactions produced in a family, in the entire village and even the officials of the Castle by seemingly trivial actions.  Unraveling these complex emotions and relationships is the most challenging task presented to us by The Castle.<br /><br />The last difficulty that I would like to point out, and perhaps the hardest one for many readers, is the problem of thinking that Kafka is not describing the world as it is but only a surrealistic, crazy world where nothing makes sense.  But, in fact, Kafka is describing the world as it still exists today.  He is describing the psychology of real people who are still alive and functioning in corporations, schools, churches, universities and governments in America and the rest of the world.<br /><br />We must enter into the world of The Castle expecting to find ourselves and the people we've encountered in our own lives if we want to make sense of it, to appreciate it for the great work of art that it is and to appropriate it for our own needs which are immense.g, they sought  with their heads boring into each other's [...]; their embraces and arched bodies, far from making them forget, reminded them of their duty to keep searching, like dogs desperately pawing at the earth they pawed at each other's bodies, and then, helpless and disappointed, in an effort to catch one last bit of happiness, their tongues occasionally ran all over each other's faces.

B00133MKVK|5.0|I've been a fan of Dame Shirley Bassey for some time and I find her just simply unbelievable. She is amazing in that she has been able to sustain her talent and ability for over 50 yrs. I hope that she can \\"Keep the Party\\" going for a long time yet. I can't imagine the world without her.

B00004WKII|3.0|I bought this boxed set after my old Hendrix CD's mysteriously disappeared.  I thought the set would replace the classic albums, but every track is an alternate version.  With the exception of a \\"Star Spangled Banner\\" (which bears NO resemblence to the awesome Woodstock version) the cuts make acceptable -- and occasionally superior -- substitutes for the classic Hendrix hits.
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|I can't believe this movie has got even one good review. The filming of the movie was terrible. The movie was dark the special effects were terrible. I couldn't wait for this movie to end. The acting was terrible and I found myself cheering for the monster. It would be niced if the movie had a plot and was based on some sound principles. This movie wouldn't have even made a good \\"B\\" movie. Hollywood needs to produce a lot better product. Thank goodness for RedBox because I only wasted a dollar. I would have been upset if I would have spend $20 for this pathetic movie.
0894803123|4.0|I've recently started making homemade ice cream, and trust me, using this book your culinary experiments will turn out way better tasting (and possibly better for you) than the commercial kind you can get down the street.     When you buy ice cream from the supermarket, a lot of the time you're buying plenty of air that whips into the final batch and bolsters the volume of that pint that looks yummy from the picture on the carton but ends up tasting like cold lint from your dryer vent. When you make it yourself you control the ingredients down to your favorite chocolate or the freshest peaches. And who better to take recipe advise from than the kings of ice cream making?    Most of Ben & Jerry's most famous flavors have their secrets deliciously divulged in this book along with anecdotes from the duo and explanations as to why you shouldn't skip ingredients. The newer flavors, like my favorites Phish Food and Americone Dreams, are sadly missing since they've only been created since this was published. But there are still loads of recipes and plenty of variations.     This book had everything from how to make your own hot fudge sauce, to the possibilities of beer sorbet, to the intricacies of blending your own  New York Super Fudge Chunk. However, if you want that mint chocolate chip to LOOK like theirs...don't forget to add a few drops of food coloring. That little detail is overlooked in all the recipes and lets face it, if we're going to the effort of churning our own ice cream we want it to not only taste like the pints we idolize we want it to look authentic as well.
B0013BNY2Q|4.0|it was over...NOT!!!!! This album blew me away...Loved it...Upbeat and strong effort form Georgia's own...Man-Sized Wreath,Supernatural Superserious,Hollow Man,Until The Day Is Done,Horse To Water(my fave )and I'm Gonna DJ,highlight this fun rocking album. Only making me look forward to the next one a lot more.But,in the meantime,I will enjoy this album to the end!!!! It rocks and don't hesitate on buying it.I loved it and am sure if you are one who was sceptical..don't be...A solid 4.8,if I could do it that way....Borderline GREAT..If not \\"Classic\\"!!!!!
B00004RFFI|5.0|I know that some people would go on a tangent about how this truly does not occur.. the waves of tornadoes and such. It is a movie, not a documentary. And as such, I think it is one of my favorites (Jaws and Godfather also rank the top billings iwth me). I enjoyed it, the story, the special effects, the whole thing. I have witnessed 2 tornadoes in my life, and both are truly the work of mother nature. This movie brings that and so much more. Get it, and if you have the chance to get to Universal Studios, go, and ride \\"twister\\"... you will love it!
B00154GEFU|4.0|Loved it!!!!.When I heard the original lineup was getting back together, I was thrilled.The album wasn't disappointing at all.Never Again,Heroine,Alibis(my fave on album),Shadow of A Doubt & Over & Over were my faves.It is a real solid effort form beg. to end.Reminding me very much of the old Asia from the 80's. Poppy \\"rock\\"...A good formula for me. So,if you were a fan of the first two albums,go get this one now.It is real good.A solid 4.5 for solid rock!!!!!
B00133KDM8|5.0|I just became aquainted with Nightwish - Tarja since the Once album.  Nightwish's new album with Anette is good, but I have to give credit to Tarja for this album.  Where I was left with wanting something a bit more on the new NW album, Tarja delivers.  With a couple of listen-throughs, this album gets even better.
B00005JMAH|5.0|I like the speed and promptness of the delivery. I also really love the movie.
B0014Z4OQG|4.0|From producer J.J. Abrams, Matt Reeves' Cloverfield came out of nowhere (literally) to make itself known as a modern day monster movie smash.  Revolving around a group of young people in Manhattan caught in the middle of an attack by an otherworldly beast, Cloverfield is a success thanks to the ingenuity of everyone involved, and even more so because the film was so kept under wrap during production.  The filming technique may make you a little nauseous (though not nearly as bad on the small screen), but it is a decidedly effective way to present an otherwise tried and tired story, and puts some inventive and new spins on the monster movie genre.  It isn't anything spectacular in the least, and the lack of any sort of backstory is a bit of a disappointment, but Cloverfield is incredibly effective for what it is, and in that respect alone, the film is a treat.  There are a nice selection of extras on the DVD for a single disc release, including an insightful documentary on the making of the film, alternate endings, and an entertaining commentary from director Matt Reeves among other extras.
B0010X745K|5.0|This movie absolutely blew me away.<br /><br /> I've been a horror movie fan for years, and movies like It and Sleepwalkers scared the bejesus out of me. But it seems that over time, the horror movie genre has either gotten more stale by the second, or I've just seen so many that I'm jaded as hell.<br /><br /> The Mist REALLY lived up to my expectations of good horror. The first thing that made me like it was there was NO SEX ANYWHERE in this movie! Hollywood has gotten it in it's head that sex sells a movie, but everytime I've ever watched a movie with copius amounts of grunge in it (take the newer dawn of the dead movie, for example) with friends, we all just cringe. This movie had NONE of that. It also spared us the obligatory big boobed blonde chick running up a set of stairs or hiding in the closet. That was my first yay.<br /><br /> After that, it only continued to get better. The entire movie enthralls you as you watch the disintegrating social structure when so many people ar eput together. I felt this was highly true to human nature. The monsters were the glam of the movie, sure, but the real horror was in watching the people. With the zealot going off, and what happened to several of the characters ( namely the soldier later on) was absolutely terrifying for me to watch. I haven't been this enthralled with a movie since I was young. I didn't want to get up to pee it was that good. The whole movie, the mist, coupled with Dead Can Dance's song \\" Host of Serephim\\" just made for a haunting, frightening world in which these characters had to live through.<br /><br /> The ending goes without saying. I prayed for \\" not another it's a dream\\" ending, and this movie delivered. My husband and I were SO HORRIFIED by the ending we could hardly beleive they allowed it to be produced-but the ending was the biggest horror of all, and threw me for such a loop there was no way I could call it conventional, or even expected. I was blindsided by this leap from normal Hollywood endings, and that thrilled me.<br /><br /> Five stars. This movie kicked major tail.ed me.      Five stars. This movie kicked major tail.
B0014Z4OQG|5.0|I do understand the negative reviews guys, but I have to say, this was a very pleasant surprise!  Very clever plot and script that never overstays its welcome, I think it clocks in at a little over 70 minutes, which feels right for this. I love the lack of back story too, if this really happened, no one would know where it came from as it was unfolding!  And the unknown cast worked well for this movie as well.  The computer generated effects are absolutely stunning, I've never seen better.  And unlike the creatures in The Mist, the monsters here are well thought out and rendered.  Very cool that the monster is rarely shown, but not bogus as you do get several good shots of it.  I did have some problems with it, if I was to get picky.  I'm pretty sure the scale of the monster changes by several hundred feet, depending on what shot it is in. And although the Statue of Liberty head bouncing down the street is neat, I'm pretty sure it is way too small to scale.  Of course, I might be wrong, these guys seem to have gotten everything else right!  A very entertaining film, right up there with the other classics of the genre.
6300214435|1.0|Expect nothing, lower your expectations, brace yourself and you might not be disappointed.  I could be wrong, but I believe that when they opened the Ark in the first movie, everyone who watched got a glimpse of this one.  Probably one of the 10 worst movies I have ever seen.
1419551795|4.0|I used this book the day before I took the GMAT just to gain some extra insight on the areas that I had the most errors on the practice tests. I was scoring about 600 - 650 on the practice tests but got a 710 on the actual exam. I found the explanations to be more helpful in this book than the official GMAT book and I believe that if I had spent more with this book I would have scored higher on the exam.
006112429X|4.0|This book looked like a serious downer.  I had jokingly called the \\"feel-bad book of the year\\".  But after the first 100 pages or so, I was really interested in what was going to hapen.  And the end was a suprise although I might have seen it coming if I have thought about it.  After I finished it - it really made me think about the characters.  I pondered what it might be like to have a son like Kevin.  He is not what he seems.  Niether is she.
B000F8O2PG|5.0|I have really come to appreciate the 'Thinpak' packaging for TV series seasons.  Stargate SG-1 ran for 10 seasons and would take a tremendous amount of shelf space were it not for Thinpak.  I can't say that any single episode is that much better than the others or that one season is better than another.  Stargate is just consistently good entertainment and better than the movie on which it is based, in my opinion.

0743277708|5.0|Watership Down was probably the best story I have ever had the pleasure to get lost in. The imagery in this books is absolutely incredable; out of this world: Adams takes the reader deep into the story so that you are experiencing all the emotion, sounds, smells, fears, excitement, and all else that the characters experience. I got so attached to the characters that I cried at the ending. I have never ever cried over a book...a movie...but not a book. I'll never forget this story- loved it so much that I'm on amazon right now checking out some of Richard Adams' other books to purchase. Highly recommend this book to readers who enjoy having their imagination stimulated...not the right book for those who get lost in too much discription
B000JJRIP2|5.0|this is a great cd especially the 2000 cd its the oringal 4 doing the other material from lick it up to revenge. if your a kiss fan it's a must.
B000I2J0W4|4.0|Still a fantastic movie even after seeing it 10+ times. Picture quality is great, not as clear as \\"newer\\" HD-DVD movies but still very good. The extra detail could be a minus because some things look very fake. Remember the scene near the end with the person in that bear suit? Remember thinking WTF is with all this? In the HD-DVD version, the costume looks like a $5 buck cheapo rental taking away some of the insanity of that scene    A lot of bonus features like a \\"Making Of\\" and cast interviews. If you liked this movie at all it's a great addition to your HD-DVD collection
B00168ML4I|5.0|Murder. Cannibalism. Death. Obsession. Revenge. Blood. Goth makeup. And lots of razors -- \\"at last, my arm is complete again!\\" Sweeney Todd exults.<br /><br />Somehow it doesn't come as a shock to me that Tim Burton adapted Stephen Sondheim's musical \\"Sweeney Todd - The Demon Barber of Fleet Street\\" -- or that he somehow spun it into something so delicious. That dark, grotesque, hilariously melodramatic story is perfectly suited to Burton's style, and Johnny Depp is absolutely stunning as the titular bloody barber.<br /><br />The malignant Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) lusts after the wife of Benjamin Barker (Depp), so he convicts Barker of a crime he didn't commit, and enfolds his family into his evil hands.<br /><br />But fifteen years later, the Barker returns to London and sets up a barber shop over Mrs. Lovett's ghastly meat pie store. Of course, he's enraged when he learns that his wife was raped and since poisoned herself, and that his daughter is the ward of the lecherous Judge. Enraged and maddened, Barker renames himself \\"Sweeney Todd\\" and vows revenge.<br /><br />And he finds that he LOVES using his razors for a far bloodier task than shaving. With the help of Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter) -- who finds a thrifty use for those bodies -- Todd cuts a bloody swathe through all who have wronged him. And when his daughter is punished for refusing to marry the cruel Judge, Sweeney closes in to get his revenge at last.<br /><br />There's always been a gothic look to Burton's movies, and he's always dabbled in very twisted, macabre storylines. And he really tops himself with \\"Sweeney Todd - The Demon Barber of Fleet Street\\" -- London is painted in black, white and grey, right down to the ghoulish faces of the characters, and their bleak little dens of horror. And songs -- lots of magnificently horrible songs.<br /><br />But Burton pretty obviously adores the combination of gory grotesquerie and very, very sick humour (\\"They don't commit sins of the flesh, so it's pretty fresh\\"). And he doesn't try to make Sweeney or Mrs. Lovett palatable, thankfully. While we sympathize with Sweeney's losses, and the horrors that have changed him into the Demon Barber, you just can't pass over scenes where they sing, \\"It's man devouring man, my dear!\\" \\"Then who are we to deny it in here?\\"<br /><br />There are some moments that relieve this gory gothic parade -- there's a sweet love story between Sweeney's daughter and a young sailor. And the plot becomes progressively darker toward the end (yes, it CAN get worse), when the plot throws us some shocking new twists, resulting in a Grecian-tragedy finale soaked in even more gore.<br /><br />Oh yes, there's blood. Tons of it. It spurts like Monty Python's bloodier sketches, which ends up being more hilarious than yucky -- as is the casual introduction of cannibal meat pies. And there are some spectacularly gross moments, like a finger found in one of the pies.<br /><br />Burton uses some of his favorite actors in this one, particularly Depp and Bonham-Carter. Depp is THE perfect ideal Sweeney Todd -- his creepy eyes, pallid face and still, almost seductive manner are perfect for the maddened murderous barber. He goes through the movie slashing his razors at the world, and injects a real creepiness into scenes like Sweeney cooing at his \\"friends.\\"<br /><br />While she's only a passable singer, Bonham-Carter is eerily wholehearted as Todd's equally amoral partner-in-crime, who is quite happy to assist him.... and make tastier pies in the process. Rickman is wonderfully loathsome as the Judge, and Sacha Baron Cohen has a small but priceless role as Pirello, a huckster acquaintance of Todd's who starts causing trouble. He really steals his scenes.<br /><br />Most directors would have prettified, sanitized and defanged the grotesque \\"Sweeney Todd - The Demon Barber of Fleet Street,\\" but Tim Burton and Johnny Depp revel in the gore and madness.

B0014Z4OQG|4.0|I missed this in the theatres (dang - I think that's where it worked best) and found the DVD presentation entertaining but not overwhelming.  The film is short, so you think, \\"wait - was that everything?\\" as it abruptly ends about 75 minutes in.<br /><br />But, of course, DVD viewers get what the theater-goers missed out on, all the obligatory making-of DVD extras that help us understand what we're actually looking at.  Most of the extras weren't that great, but the featurette on the special effects was pretty illuminating -- after watching it I did gain a lot of respect for the technical end of the filmmaking -- how they matched up the CGI to the jerky, mile-a-minute camcorder footage.  Pretty impressive.<br /><br />This is an okay monster movie: having turned a profit, hopefully JJ Abrams & Co will be able to crank out a sequel where the big bad makes it out of Manhattan and we can see (and learn) more about what makes this bug tick. I'd definitely watch that one, too! (Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)
0375701427|1.0|I enjoyed the first few chapters of this book.  I get it.  It explains the transition from the purpose driven America of the 40's and 50's to the unraveling in the 60's as the next generation came of age.  Eventually however, the writing and the narrative got very bogged down for me.  It's a little bit like moving to a new neighborhood and finding yourself living across the street from a self appointed expert on the 60's.  At first it is interesting and you think, \\"Hey, this guy is deep\\".  Eventually, however, as this guy runs across the street and starts explaining the 60's every day as you pull into your driveway, it gets to be like an unwelcome beating.  This book was like that for me.  I think I got the message in the first few chapters and the middle was like a long beating.  I can't say what the end is like because I'm not going to read it.  I found a Michael Chabon book the bookshop that I have not read and since I took it home, I cannot bring myself to continue reading American Pastoral.  Chabon has won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and I love Chabon.  I cannot explain how Roth won the same prize for American Pastoral.
B00132D808|5.0|This cd is awesome. I loved their first cd, but this one I like alot more. It's different but it still has that kooky PATD sound and I love the lyrics. It's got more of a romantic tone to it. but more of a strange (in a good way) romance. I think if you liked their other cd you'll like this one too.

Now if I can keep it up for 29 more days!
B0010X745K|5.0|As a general rule, I've liked the film adaptations of King's short stories (Silver Bullet, Maximum Overdrive) better than the adaptations of his novels (Cujo, Shining).<br /><br />A lot of reviewers seem to think that the controversial ending of this particular adaptation was contrary to King's vision -- but at the end of the short story the protagonist clearly states that he has several bullets left and is willing to do what he needs to do if necessary -- then it concludes with the vision of the giant creature from another dimension lumbering overhead.  The film follows this train of thought to its logical conclusion -- and, according to the commentary -- King himself approved the script, stating that he wished he'd ended the story that way instead.  Ending was powerful and brilliant . . . but then there was the surprise twist immediately thereafter which made it so much more horrible.  THAT -- those last couple of minutes -- really should've been snipped off and reserved as an \\"alternate\\" ending, in my opinion.  If the mist NEVER cleared it would've been much better, and the sacrifice more noble.  But no -- gotta make the hero look like a fool for transgressing a societal taboo toward the greater good.<br /><br />Acting was brilliant, casting was perfect, script was amazing, effects were good (but it's more what we DON'T see than what we do).  Powerful societal commentary regarding such diverse subjects as: the disolution of civilized behavior during an extended crisis, the attraction of religious zealotry during a time of helplessness, and the responsible use of firearms by private citizens (as opposed to 99% of the televised portayals of such).  The fact that such care was put into making even minor characters fully developed and likeable makes it that much jarring when bad things happen to them . . . very unlike the typical \\"horror\\" or \\"suspense\\" flick where the audience neither likes nor cares about the characters -- and in many cases is actually glad to see them gone.  These characters are like our neighbors, our co-workers, our friends . . . and to see them being subjected to this is truly scary.<br /><br />THE MIST is probably the most REALISTIC horror film I've ever seen (if you can overlook the whole extradimensional monster thing).  OUTSTANDING film in every way -- the best thing to come out of a major studio in the past decade.

B00003W8NM|5.0|Great movie.  I like the packaging for this DVD.  The extras are good and gives the viewer a little more knowledge of behind the scenes filming and special effects production.  Great acting by Pitt, Norton, and Carter.  I have seen this movie over and over again.  If you like stories with a biting sense of humor with a pinch of violence, this is the movie for you.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I purchased this video because all the previous reviews. I have to say it is not a lie. I have only done the video twice and I'm not sure I can do it the 3rd day in a row due to soreness. Hopefully I can pick back up tomorrow. Both days it was hard to finish a couple of the exercises but I pushed through hoping it will be easier soon. Every muscle in my body is sore at this point. Definitely recommend this DVD.
0452289963|5.0|Thank you to Mr. Tolle, for putting the ego into perspective and recognizing that WE ARE NOT OUR ego. He also identified the \\"pain body\\" as something that makes us react a certain way to situations in our lives. Simply the most important book in decades!
B000NDIAWY|5.0|This CD immediately became my new favorite after just a couple of listens. Her voice is incredible. She combines the best vocal qualities of Patsy Cline's, Gwen Stefani's, and Jewel's voices with her own gutsy, emotionally powerful style. On the title track, The Story, she lets loose with her voice and it \\"shreds\\" at one point(I don't know how else to describe it). It is amazing. Her music is essentially rock with a flair for vocals, which at times give it a more folk rock, or alternative country appeal, depending on the song. There are no songs that are \\"duds\\" on the album, so you can play it straight through with no skipping. There are some songs that are mellow or sad, and some that are very energetic and upbeat. I love them all.
B000UGG39Q|2.0|I am a huge fan of the first two Down releases, and am disappointed in this CD.  I can get into most of the songs, but I am let down that the overall style is less aggressive and, well, pissed-off and evil.  And \\"Nothing in Return\\" sounds way too close to Zepplin's \\"No Quarter.\\"<br /><br />Also, I hate the mix of this CD; the low frequencies dominate so much that the CRUNCH of the guitars is lost.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|This CD is amazing! I loved the Broadway show and was amazed by the fact that i could buy this CD, for the price that it was. I recommend this to anyone who loved all the freakiness of Wicked!

B000UZNRS2|3.0|Let me begin by saying that I did not read the other Camel Club books, so I concede that I may have missed some character development in the prior books of the series. However, I found Stone Cold to be filled with one-dimensional characters and I found the plot lines to be entirely predictable and stale.<br /><br />The book wasn't entirely unenjoyable, but for intellectual stimulation, I'd go with something else.
B001CC7PP8|5.0|I purchased the Psycho Collectors Edition right before it went out of print. When I heard that it went out of print, it felt like I caught a wiff of fresh air. I was glad I had my copy of Psycho, especially considering that it is my favorite movie of all time.    After I heard that they were re-releasing Psycho, I was somewhat dissapointed. I had already spent $15 on the movie, and I didn't want to spend another $20 for another edition. I avoided the special edition for several months, but after reading over the features, I couldn't help myself.    The features include all that was on the Collectors edition (A making of documentary, a newsreel clip, photos, and trailers) along with a new documentary on Alfred Hitchcock's directing career, an episode from Hitchcock's tv show, and an in depth interview. The transfer is also an improvment over the prvious edition.
B0010V4TZU|3.0|I've had a strange, irregular series of reactions to this band.<br /><br />I heard that Vampire Weekend was the Hot New Thing, but didn't get around to investigating the music for awhile.<br /><br />Then I heard they would appear on \\"Saturday Night Live\\" in another week or two, so I looked up their MySpace profile. I don't remember if I streamed more than one track, but \\"Oxford Comma\\" instantly knocked me out. Loved it. Still love it. The nifty inverted chords, &agrave; la Brian Wilson...the delightful hook of those goofy, sixth-interval jumps (\\"I've seen those English dramas to-OOH/They're cru-OOL\\").... I probably listened to that song a dozen times within a day or two.<br /><br />But then I saw the group perform on SNL and...kerplunk. They were one of the \\"greenest\\" acts I've ever seen on the show. Came off like they'd been playing together for six months, tops. Just seemed like college dorks playing a local house party for beer, laughs and maybe a cute girl's phone number. They couldn't have been more \\"white boy,\\" which is odd since their songs have such strong ska/calypso/African elements. And I didn't like how they even emphasized their nerdiness in such a contrived way, with the preppy sweaters, the repressed body language and all that. And...the little creeps didn't even play \\"Oxford Comma\\"! They were lucky to have a professional string section onstage with them, because I really don't think they could have handled this large-scale venue on their own.<br /><br />Still, I bought the album anyway. I put off grinding all the way through it for a couple of months, but I listened in bits and pieces.<br /><br />I finally gave it a full, intense listen about a week ago. And it's simply not a keeper. The lyrics can be clever and the music is an interesting mix of styles, but that's not enough. \\"Oxford Comma\\" is still magical, but I don't enjoy any other song nearly as much. The sequencing is also a problem -- the first three tracks are the strongest, so the rest of the disc feels like a downhill slide.<br /><br />Hearing this album, I'm immediately thrown back to my college days -- yes, I'm dating myself here -- when everybody around me \\"partied\\" with [[ASIN:B00008BRDV Zenyatta Mondatta]] and [[ASIN:B000021XS8 I Just Can't Stop It]] (two albums which I never bought myself). It's particularly hard not to think of the English Beat while hearing \\"A-Punk.\\" Except the Beat and Police had some genuine rhythmic muscle and groove, whereas Vampire Weekend just daintily flits about. For beer, laughs and maybe a cute girl's phone number.<br /><br />I'll be very surprised if this band sustains its buzz with future releases. They're probably nice guys, but they're a hype all the same.<br /><br />This year's freshman-dorm album. A year or two ago, maybe it was the Shins, Death Cab for Cutie or Rilo Kiley. Now it's Vampire Weekend. Next year...who knows.g this album, I'm immediately thrown back to my college days -- yes, I'm dating myself here -- when everybody around me \\"partied\\" with [[ASIN:B00008BRDV Zenyatta Mondatta]] and [[ASIN:B000021XS8 I Just Can't Stop It]] (two albums which I never bought myself).

B000U0F7RG|5.0|I'm loving my boxset and all I can say is thank God I got bronchitis at just the right time. I've spent the last week watching episode after episode and there must be something said about a show that can keep you entertained for a week on end. I haven't seen this show since it aired on television and the current viewing of season six on Aussie TV is erratic at best so when I saw this on Amazon I just had to snap it up. I'm so glad I waited till the complete set came out before I bought the boxsets individually. Gorgeously presented to suit the whole Gilmore Girls theme and so easy to transport or share with friends. Highly recommended!
B000WCBPOG|2.0|I've heard a lot of Beatles covers throughout my life, dear friends. For the record, I am not among those who claim the only good Beatles songs are the one performed by the Beatles themselves.  Many artists have delivered the goods when covering the mighty Beatles.  It is a daunting task, to say the least.    This soundtrack has some real poopy versions, no doubt because some of them are sung by the original cast.  Evan Rachel Wood is the unholiest of offenders.  I liked hearing a cover of \\"Hold Me Tight\\", an early Beatles song that is rarely performed by others.  But I think she positively made mince meat of the others she sang - especially \\"If I Fell\\".     In fact, dear followers, the presence of the titan Joe Cocker (himself responsible for arguably the only Beatles cover to actually out-do the original: \\"With a Little Help From My Friends\\") on a moody, atmospheric \\"Come Together\\" save this from the lowliest of all ratings.  Hey, I call 'em like I see 'em, like it or lump it.    That phoney crusader Bono manages to strangle two Beatles' classics.  Go back to U2, I say!  And I'm sure most of you (well, those with a modicum of intelligence) will agree.

0790734850|5.0|Damn you Titanic! Had it not been for that sinking ship, Oscar would have gone to bed with L.A. Confidential!     I'm no noir aficionado, let alone a lover of cop flicks, but this one, THIS one, I absolutely adore. I bought it on VHS when it came out and would watch every now and then. Though it was senior year in high school, seven years ago, that I was constantly watching \\"L.A. Confidential\\" over and over again. I was wearing out my VHS copy! I just couldn't get enough. I was so impressed with it (I still am). The writing, the directing, the acting, the production design, cinemaphotography, the music, the finale; everything was so flawless! Who doesn't love these characters: \\"Shotgun\\" Ed, Officer Bud White, Jack Vincennes, Lynn Bracken, and Captain Dudley?  This is definitely director, Curtis Hanson's masterpiece (forget \\"Lucky You\\" already!).     \\"L.A. Confidential\\" ranks with the best of the best. It's one of my favorite films of all time. It's simply fantastic!
B000OY8NII|4.0|Granted it can get a little cliched at times, but it's still an entertaining show.  I like the variety of geniuses in Eureka, and I may enjoy Nathan Stark just a little too much.  It's a great purchase of sci-fi fans.
B00003CY6M|5.0|Not normally a movie I'd chose to watch but I'm glad I did. As a guy, I prefer more action. But my wife loved it. A great movie to watch alone at night. Very romantic. Definitely, a \\"chick flick\\" (my wife's words!). Well done. Leaves you feeling good at the end.    Kate Beckinsale is an absolute sweetheart (and beautiful!). She makes this movie. Wish I could see her in more movies!    I also bought the sound track and love it. Very relaxing and upbeat songs.    If you want to make your wife/girlfriend happy, buy this movie and let the romance blossom.
B000P2A24W|5.0|I must say I was introduced to Bon Jovi's music in 1992. I think it was the best time period to get to know the band. At the time the band and the whole music scene was changing and I immediately fell in love with the band's new sound. Of course I was aware of the existing of the band before 1992 as well, but when Keep the Faith came out I think the band gained a wider audience. I consider that album a watershed in their career. At the time the album was the most listened one among my albums. As I was getting older and wiser of course my taste changed and after These days I lost my interest in the band. Now I've got all their albums but this latest release is considered the most powerful and artistically the most mature album they have ever written. They proved they have grown up and can gain themselves a brand new audience in another music genre as well. I take this change for a very good step after \\"Have a nice day\\".   I just simply can't get enough of this album. I keep listening to it every day. It deserved number one status all around the world.  BRAVO BOYS KEEP ON ROCKING!
B0011HF6GE|5.0|I listen for tone that elicits a core emotional response and, for me, this is one of those rare popular recordings that has it in spades.  The falsetto layered vocals often obscure the lyrics which, strangely, I frequently prefer.  The full experience of this music is thrilling with an authentic yearning that doesn't require the often shabby symbols of well enunciated lyrics.  Do you find that the human voice can often musically convey more when only bordering on intelligibility?<br /><br />This is a unique album with a wonderful sound that just might set off some mental fireworks for you as it did for me.
0740748475|4.0|Product was delivered well on time, however unfortunately the case was slightly damaged. As this is a collector's item I would have appreciated if the book was wrapped in bubble plastic, instead of that it was just put in the box without any protection.    This is the only reason I rated it 4 stars instead of 5, because the book itself is great. I always enjoyed the comics and I was delighted to see that a collection was available in the original language (something not easy to get in my country). Certainly an excellent gift or treat for someone who is a fan of Calvin & Hobbes!

B000069HZP|4.0|In the Game director David Fincher would introduce many of the same themes he would expand upon in his next film Fight Club. Both films tell the tale of wealthy but bored men who feel dead inside, they don't feel like they belong or have any connection with anyone. Both men decide that they need a life changing experience to shake them out of their apathy and get them to start living again. In the case of the Game that lost man is Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas) a multimillionaire who oversees a publishing company. On his forty eight birthday he gets a mysterious gift from his younger and irresponsible brother Conrad (Sean Penn). The gift is actually a gift card to a shadowy company called CRS and Nicholas has his reservations. He happens upon their headquarters by chance and is subjected to a barrage of mental and physical tests before he is even accepted. One of my favorite character actors James Rebhorn plays the man behind CRS Dr. Feingold. All Feingold will tell an inquisitive Nicholas is \\" Admit to yourself that it sounds interesting. We provide what is lacking in your life.\\" Soon Nicholas's game begins and he finds his life in danger almost immediately. This film which could also be a sort of precursor to the Saw films as well has no graphic violence the torture is all psychological. Nicholas is haunted by the memory of his father who killed himself on Nicholas's birthday over thirty years ago and the fact that he was Nicholas's age when he did it weighs heavy on his mind. He wonders how much of his father is in him. Conrad who has battled drug addiction will only tell Nicholas that he too has played the Game and that he has never felt better. \\" They make your life fun again.\\" is what he tells his younger brother. Nicholas does get some help in the form of Kathleen (Deborah Kara Unger) a waitress he meets along the way and who may know more about the Game than she lets on to Nicholas. The film has a fantastic ominous mood enhanced by the cinematography of Harris Savides and especially a jangling piano score from Howard Shore. To reveal too much of what happens to Nicholas during his Game would take away from several scenes that play like a nightmare. I loved the acting and the feel of the film but had a problem with the ending. I didn't find it completely believable and a little too convenient. Still the film is very good and Douglas in the lead does an amazing job as he slowly begins to unravel. His whole world is turned upside down in the course of this film and his realization at the ending while not entirely believable is still well acted throughout. The DVD features two trailers and notes on the cast and crew.
B000Y8GFY8|5.0|HELLO I've been wanting to review this album since I got it.I can only echo what most of the other reviewers have already said.I thought I could hear influences of sgt. pepper, pet sounds, even pink floyd but what emerges is totally new and unique sound.This album has changed GOLDFRAPP from music I always thought was really good to one of my top favorites I just can't stop listening.There have been a lot of \\"highly anticipated\\" new releases(MOBY,REM,etc.)that I wish I could get my money back,but this is the best record I've heard in along time.Also GOLDFRAPP have just not gotten the attention and exposure they deserve.Maybe this album will do it for them.THANKS DENNISC9

B00004SA86|5.0|Some years ago, I gave high praise to this complete cycle, recorded between 1967 and 1971, in its original CD reissue from 1990. At the time, I noted its naturalness, expressiveness and authenticity even as Kubelik brought out the music's Bohemian lineage more strongly than its grounding in the Austro-Germanic symphonic tradition. Time has only deepened my appreciation of what this series, now in a slimline box, delivers. Kubelik's unvarnished approach to this composer goes lighter on the bombast and may strike some as a little too plain-spoken, yet it always refreshes. Now and again Kubelik's fast tempi result in some scrambled ensemble by the idiomatic-sounding Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, but I'll take that over polished blandness any day of the week. I still rank the Gary Bertini box (which, unlike this set, also includes \\"Das Lied von der Erde\\" as well as texts and translations) as perhaps the best \\"total package\\" of interpretation, playing and sound quality in a complete Mahler cycle, yet even that does not bring Mahler to life as palpably as this does for me.

In addition, her writing style is smooth and readers will find the plot line easy enough to read, yet not to easy as to \\"walk through.\\"  Her ability to bring forth the characters--and their plights--is also striking.  In short, this is a book that is refreshing to read; let's home Ms Morton has some follow ups!
0553573411|1.0|I really had very high hopes for this book.  After reading the first book and watching helplessly as Fitz gets beat down and broken to the point of near-suicidal depression, I was certain that all the talents and abilities he has would be put to good use in this book.  In fact, the only reason I didn't put the book down after the first few chapters was because I was CERTAIN that if I just kept reading I would get to the glorious payoff where Fitz FINALLY lashes out at those who keep trying to kill him and those he loves, making it all worthwhile.  Spoiler alert...it doesn't come...EVER...    As other reviewers have said, the actions of the protagonists of the book are literally stupid beyond belief.  I'm sorry, but you can't convince me that Fitz would simply wait around to be killed, especially after attempts on his life had already been made.  They all have the power to save both the king and the kingdom, but they refuse to do so for the most idiotic reasons.  The most common excuse for inaction is that they're sworn to their king and as such they must be willing to forfiet their lives for him.  They seem to be ignorant of the fact that the whole point of dying for king and country is to keep both safe.  But throughout the whole book they watch helplessly as the king is constantly drugged and the kingdom is dragged into ruin.  They even know who's doing it, yet they refuse to do anything about it...because the drugged king hasn't said they could!  IT'S LUNACY!!!  I'm certain that Fitz could have stood and watched as Regal convinced King Shrewd to scribble his worthless signature on an execution order, and Fitz would have walked himself to the gallows and put the noose around his own neck, all the while complaining about how terrible his life is and wishing there was something he could do to save himself.      I would disagree with the other reviewers about the title.  The book is filled with royal assassins...all of them trying to kill Fitz.  Other than mindlesslyslaughtering red-ship raiders, the only two people Fitz manages to \\"assassinate\\" he does so...when he's high on carris seed!  If you like your protagonists to be whimpering, cowardly, idoits who mindlessly follow orders, this book is for you.  Personally, I prefer my fantasy/adventure heroes to act heroically.

0060987464|3.0|It's actually a pretty good read which was surprising to me.  My son could identify with the childhood that M.M. had and realized that the adversity and difficulties that he himself has faced and faces makes him who he is and makes him stronger and that he could use this strength to become something great.  I personally don't care for a lot of M.M.'s shocking ways but I do admire his intelligence because he knows what it takes to stand out in the crowded music industry and sell sell sell... smart business man.  Good book - My son is 17 and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone younger than that because of the material.

B0014Z4OQG|5.0|The moment I found this was a handheld camera movie, I didn't want to see it.  Blair Witch was hyped up as an awesome movie, and it was dumb.    This movie was probably the best action movie of the year.  I thought that this is a realistic approach to how the military would react and people with panic, September 11th came to mind, but also, how cool it is that this monster is doing all the carnage, Godzilla style.  September 11th meets Godzilla, terror meets bad A action.  This movie makes you feel uncomfortable, unsettled and hopefully, makes you realize that living in a big city is a bad idea!!!!

Man-sized wreath is my new favorite song.  While the album is only about 38 minutes long, it's definitely worth it, as they spent time focusing on the music rather than trying to load as many songs as possible onto a cd, and we finally get that great sound we originally associated with Michael Stipe and REM
0763619612|5.0|This is one of the greatest kids books ever!  Especially for my son, who always thinks he has to be perfect.  This book shows kids that everyone has their own talents; it might not be what you thought was perfect, but it can still be beautiful and amazing, unique and yours.  I hope this book gives more children the courage to do their own thing and express themselves.

B0014Z4OQG|3.0|Okay, now that you've read all of the reviews about the \\"shaky\\" camera-work, put all of that aside. Most of the negative reviews posted refer to the cinematic release of \\"Cloverfield\\" which some folks suffered from motion sickness. Odds are, that is not going to happen to you with this DVD release (unless you own that 100\\" Sony plasma TV recently rolled out). I saw \\"Cloverfield\\" in the theater and had no problem, and watching the DVD last night posed no problem at all for my wife who is prone to motion sickness.<br /><br />That aside, I have to say, \\"Cloverfield\\" is a fun, and very clever movie. I'm not going to run down the basic storyline as I'm not into spoiling any aspect of the film (feel free to browse through the mulitude of reviews that spell out exactly how the film unfolds if you wish). Besides, by now you most likely know the basics of the movie.<br />Sure it's a monster movie, a very cool monster movie, told in a unique way. You actually get to root for some of the characters which is odd, considering most of the time in horror films is spent rooting for the monster.<br /><br />The one aspect I loved about \\"Cloverfield\\" is that the creature is not \\"misunderstood\\", or \\"a harmless animal who is frightened and doing what it would naturally\\". NO the Big-McLarge-Huge monster in \\"Cloverfield\\" is mean, and sinister. This beast is out to hurt, maim, destroy and eat anything in it's path without mercy. It's big and it's ticked off at us for some reason. Sure there may be little to no backstory on the beast.....GREAT. I don't want to know how, why, or from where this thing decided to attack. It adds a nice element of mystery, and adds to the horror.<br /><br />This is a great fun B-movie, with impressive special effects, a fun cast, and is overall one of the more original monster movies to come out in years.

B000KB6D0A|3.0|Was there ever a better band at creating rock anthems than Saxon? One of the greatest things about this underrated band was their ability to write tunes about how great rock n' roll is. \\"Denim and Leather\\" is probably their best remembered tune, but \\"Strong Arm of the Law\\" features some great rock anthems as well. \\"Heavy Metal Thunder\\" was made to be played in a large arena, and I would love to have seen this tune played live. \\"Sixth Form Girls\\" has a great intro, and a great guitar hook. The song most familiar to fans off of this disk is \\"20,000 Ft.\\". Another great rocker, and the guitar work once again screams on this track. If you are a fan of the band, this is a great disk. If you are interested in giving them a try, this album isn't bad, but for new listeners I highly recommend either \\"Wheels of Steel\\" or \\"Denim and Leather\\" first.
0099993805|4.0|If you are thinking about going to law school, this wouldn't be a bad novel to read to get a sense of what the profession is all about before you commit yourself to three expensive (and potentially boring) years of education. I don't recall a book that displays so many of the corrupt sides of legal practice and education in a single fictional tale. If that weren't enough, the book also delves deeply into the international assassination genre and creates a modern-day fictional version of investigating a government cover-up at the highest levels, a la Watergate.<br /><br />But a pure heart among all the jaded ones can make a difference . . . that's the morale of this story as beautiful, dedicated, and brilliant law student Darby Shaw speculates on what motive might tie the assassination of two Supreme Court justices back to a pending legal case. Improbably (the weakest part of the story), she sniffs out the potential that no one else does -- that this is an attempt to fix an appeal.<br /><br />The Pelican Brief as a title is a misnomer. Darby writes her thoughts (a crude essay, not a brief) about what might be going on and shares them with her professor lover who passes them along to a counsel for the FBI. Pretty soon someone is taking her ideas seriously, and the pages will fly through your fingers as fast as you can read until you get to the end.<br /><br />John Grisham doesn't quite have his genres down in this book, and apparently the success of The Firm meant that his editors were more interested in getting The Pelican Brief published than making it better. You could fix this novel into a five-star effort with about two hours of editing to reduce the improbabilities and speed up the slow parts.<br /><br />But if you don't mind having unlikely events pull a riveting story together, you'll have a lot of fun with The Pelican Brief. I listened to the reading by Alexander Adams and felt that the story worked better listened to than it would be if read silently.<br /><br />I admire John Grisham for the imagination to conceive of such a wild story. He kept surprising me with his plot developments, and the trip was almost all fun.agination to conceive of such a wild story.

B000002VCU|5.0|The Turn of a Friendly Card, by The Alan Parsons Project, is an album with no weak spots. It's made of six unique compositions, the last of which is a five-part suite that takes the name of the album. This album's style is very well chosen, mixing elements from progressive rock, pop, slow ballads and symphonic rock, all with the great arrangements from Mr Parsons. It deals with the concept of gambling and taking risks, and how a man can lose all he has.  The album starts with \\"May Be a Price to Pay\\", a nice track, sung in a sort of hard tone. It's followed by \\"Games People Play\\", one of the Project's most known songs and well sung by Lenny Zakatek. Listening to this song's catchy tune is one of the most memorable moments from all the Parson's discography. Following this one, the piano in \\"Time\\" begins playing. What a delicious ballad, beautifully sung by Eric Woolfson... You'll feel like you're in heaven. It then segues into \\"I Don't Wanna Go Home\\", in my opinion the weakest song in the album (not that it's bad, but it's not at the level of the other compositions). Perhaps the best part of this one is the instrumental section halfway through the song. The next song is called \\"The Gold Bug\\". It's an instrumental only, and it reprises the beginning of \\"May Be a Price to Pay\\", with the difference that this time it's made by whistles. This track isn't either very good or bad, it starts fine but then it goes down a little when the backing vocals start. The final composition, divided in five parts, is the spectacular \\"Turn of a Friendly Card\\" suite. It's both started and ended with a version of \\"The Turn of a Friendly Card\\", the first one being more melodic. Chris Rainbow shows that he's a great singer. He also sings the following song, \\"Snake Eyes\\". This two songs summarise very well the whole concept of the album, and fit very well together. After a short silence, the instrumental \\"The Ace of Swords\\" begins, one of the Project's best instrumentals. It segues into \\"Nothing Left to Lose\\", with Eric Woolfson in vocals. This song, along with his other contribution to the album, is a very nice melodic song, and it features a reprise of \\"Snake Eyes\\" near the end of the song, in an instrumental way. When it's over, the final track, \\"The Turn of a Friendly Card, Part 2\\", will begin, with slightly different lyrics than the ones from \\"Part 1\\". This version is more instrumental, and provides a great ending to the album.  All of the songs here are worth the money, and this album is a must-have if you're a fan of the Project - or if you like progressive rock!
B00005JKL8|4.0|Is it realistic? Very little of course resembles how a downed pilot would be rescued in this scenario. Based on a true story that has the typical Hollywood wash and rinse cycle making it \\"Last Action Hero\\" bullet proof. Still forsaking the hero being shot to pieces, I still like it. Most of it seems real, and our hero isn't perfect by any means. The support cast is great and you love and hate them accordingly. The scenes are so well photographed that they actually add some reality to what otherwise would be to over the top. That and Hackman's and Wilson's performances are great. Good action and music make it at least worth a rental. Hey are you going to tell me all those old John Wayne WWII movies were realistic? Hardly, but we love them nonetheless. If you enjoyed this be sure to catch \\"Blackhawk Down\\" and \\"Bat 21\\". I personally snapped up this good quality DVD with great replayability.

0571225381|3.0|In 1956, an aged traditional English butler near the end of his career goes on a five day road trip at the suggestion of his new American employer. As Mr. Stevens drives across the country to visit an old female college, he reflects back on his thirty years of service at Darlington Hall, taking comfort in the fact that he has conducted himself with dignity and served, in Lord Darlington, a great gentleman--but lurking within his reflections are growing doubts about Lord Darlington's true nature. The Remains of the Day lacks all sense of subtlety, and so its various aspects--the reflections on how Stevens has lived and should have lived his life, the nature of Lord Darlington--fall flat. However well intended, the protagonist is unlikable and the style is heavy handed, and so this book is disappointing and unsuccessful. I do not recommend it.<br /><br />The character of Stevens is a relic from an older time, and his old fashion manners and beliefs are out of keeping with the current era. More than this, however, Stevens willfully blinds himself to anything outside of what he believes is proper to the role of a butler. He actively and intentionally limits himself to the confines of his social role until he becomes socially awkward, unable to express or even to feel emotion, unable to carry on personal relationships, unable to judge his previous employer, Lord Darlington. And though the character does, in the very last pages of the book, get an inkling clue about the harm caused by his life long self-fettering, this character growth is too little and too late. The book's protagonist and narrator is a character too unlikable for the reader to embrace. Granted, many of the book's more lively characters are pitiful or humorous, but Stevens is no better. He is awkward to read about, and left this reader feeling unpleasantly discomforted.<br /><br />The various tropes by which Ishiguro reveals Stevens's intentional self-limitations and the true nature of Lord Darlington are intended to be skillful and sly, but are instead unrealistic. Stevens will start into a recollection to make one point, only to have the reader--through an access of dramatic irony--take away a completely different point; the coherent series of events emerges too easily from Stevens's supposedly unrelated recollections. Even the writing style, in the form of a diary written in the various cities were Stevens's stops on his driving tour, is contrived: the entries are overlong, the dialog is too precisely worded.<br /><br />In a way, Ishiguro has noble goals: by creating a character that refuses to engage in independent personal thought and feeling, he in fact emphasizes the importance of each. But, despite all attempts, The Remains of the Day lacks subtlety, and so fails to impact the reader. Stevens's limitations are exaggerated, he is not a sympathetic character but rather an unlikable one, and the \\"revelations\\" of Stevens's personal life and Lord Darlington's nature are both heavy handed and predictable from a long ways off. I do not dislike this book as much as it may sound--I think the premise is promising and the message is true, and the very readable narrative voice has a convincing old world sound to it. However, I cannot recommend the novel. It does not live up to its potential, it is heavy-handed where it needs to be subtle, and ultimately reading it felt like a waste of time. Stevens remains too self-limited to see the error of these limitations, and the reader is provided with no other admirable characters.

B0007PALZ2|5.0|As many have already noted, `12 Monkeys' is one of the best (if not the best) time travel movies ever filmed.  What makes `12 Monkeys' so extraordinary is its marvelously crafted script (inspired by Chris Marker's short film `La Jetee') coupled with some stellar performances wrapped up in director Terry Gilliam's glossy packaging.  In short, `12 Monkeys' is a complete package.  There is nothing lacking in this film.  The intensity is high, the personal connection is strong, the emotional resonance is there and the overall engrossing subject matter is at an all time high.  `12 Monkeys' is a film that grabs you and sucks you into its whirlwind of science fiction intrigue.<br /><br />The film opens in the year 2035.  The world as we know it is gone, substituted by a dark and barren wasteland; a world crippled by a devastating virus that wiped out most of the human population and forced the survivors to retreat to the desolate underground.  The government comes to convict James Cole with a proposition he can't refuse; a chance to have his criminal record expunged if he `volunteers' to travel back in time and obtain a sample of this virus the government can then work with to develop a cure.  This trip sends Cole on a strange journey not only physically but mentally as well, causing Cole to challenge his thoughts and views on what is truly real.<br /><br />`12 Monkeys' brilliantly crafts a physiological thriller that stays with the viewer and challenges the way they think as well.  It's one of those films that is mentally exhausting, but in a truly rewarding way.  It's a film that leaves the audience feeling as if they just witnessed something meaningful and worthwhile; a film that ultimately becomes so much more than just a film.<br /><br />Like I mentioned, `12 Monkeys' sports some brilliant performances by the entire cast; most notably though the two male leads.  Brad Pitt (who had a phenomenal year in '95) justifiably received an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Jeffrey Goines; the mental patient who befriends Cole and just may have something to do with the unleashing of that diabolical virus.  Bruce Willis though is also flawless here and deserved an Oscar nomination as well in my humble opinion.  While Willis is undoubtedly comfortable when jumping out of the way of explosions and shooting wildly at terrorists, in `12 Monkeys' (as well as other films like `The Sixth Sense') Bruce proves that he has the acting chops to tackle the dramatic with the save fervor and comfort in which he tackles the high-octane action film.  His composure and complete understanding of his characters emotional makeup is outstanding here.  He dominates in the supreme definition of the word.  Also notable is Madeleine Stowe's performance as Kathryn Railly, the psychiatrist who Cole encounters during his travels.<br /><br />`12 Monkeys' is pure brilliance in my eyes, a film that defies odds and breaks boundaries in order to deliver something fresh and enthralling from start to finish.  This is a film unlike any other; one that mixes ample helpings of mystery and science, drama and fear creating a masterful concoction that will open your eyes and your mind in ways you never imagined.  This is a tragically underrated film that may very well be one of the best films ever made.

B0001GOH6Q|4.0|There is something extremely entertaining about Tim Burton's `Big Fish'; a mature fairy tale about a young man trying to understand the man his father truly is.  Burton has a way of taking what could easily become syrupy or saccharine and turning it into something sweet yet honest; never overplaying his hand so-to-speak.  `Big Fish' follows that formula, delivering to the audience an overload of mystical creatures and faraway lands and beautiful imagery wrapped up in a tender story about a father and son yet it never once comes across immature or childish.<br /><br />This is a plus and a minus in this case, but I'll get to that in a minute.<br /><br />The film revolves around Will and Ed Bloom.  Will has never really understood his father; in fact he appears to have a deep seeded contempt for him and the fact that he feels he was never allowed to get to know him.  This is because of all the `tall tales' Ed proceeded to tell Will his whole life.  When Will hears that his father is on his deathbed he travels home, hoping to finally hear some truth regarding his fathers life.<br /><br />What he gets is...<br /><br />Like I mentioned, `Big Fish' is visually beautiful to witness.  The sets and the costumes and the vivid use of colors are classic Burton all the way and manage to draw the audience into the fanciful world.  The stories told are all cohesive and fun to entertain.  This has a lot to do (or should I say everything to do) with the script, adapted from Daniel Wallace's novel.  Watching the stories unfold we can see clearly their truths amidst all the colorful exaggerations and this adds to the beauty of the story `outside' the stories that is unfolding between Ed and his son.<br /><br />The performances by the entire cast are wonderful as well, especially that of the two Ed's, Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor.  Albert Finney is truly one of our finest actors that ever has graced the big screen (his relentless Oscar losses are crimes against humanity) and he brings so much of his natural charm to this performance you can't help but adore it.  Ewan McGregor likewise captures the fire still burning in Finney's eyes and exemplifies it as the younger, fantasy version of Ed Bloom.  I adore McGregor as an actor and feel he has a wealth of talent under his belt.  In `Big Fish' he is as magnetic as usual and delivers a top notch performance.

078322799X|3.0|I caught this movie on TV, and it was entertaining enough for me to sit through the whole film.  I would have liked to give it a 3.6 stars if I could.  I think it has a spark of something which makes it a little better than average, but I hesitate to call it excellent (4 stars).  Since I knew nothing about this film, I was quite amazed to find people categorize it as a horror-comedy when I later looked it up here on Amazon.      I am an easily terrified person, so I generally stayed away from horror or gory movies.  I remember when I finally gathered enough courage to watch \\"The Shining\\" because it is said to be such a classic, I had to turn my head away every time I sensed something potentially scary coming up.  In the end, my total viewing time of that movie was less than 5 minutes.        I suppose this explains how much I can stomach a horror movie.  When I watched this movie, the word \\"scary\\" never came into my mind.  I though it was fun, the special effect nice, and it was nice to see Michael J Fox again after a long while (although I wished his character wasn't so headstrong, as usual). The plot could have been a little more unpredictable.  But it was fun, entertaining, but no horror movie.
B00003CXFG|4.0|Before Vin Diesel, Radha Mitchell and Cole Hauser became household names (well, maybe Diesel is the only `household' name, but the others are at least bigger stars now) they all starred together in `Pitch Black', another title in the vast sea of science fiction action horror films.  What sets `Pitch Black' apart from the rest of the pack though is the way director David Twohy is able to create a true sense of dread and misery, a feat much like Scott created with `Alien'.  Instead of just randomly giving the audience high amounts of gore Twohy instead builds a slow yet steady dissention into genuine fear.<br /><br />`Pitch Black' finds a group of space traveler's crash landing on a deserted planet that is scorching hot thanks to the presence of three suns.  Amongst these travelers is a very dangerous criminal known as Riddick who is being transported by drug addict cop William J. Johns.  When Riddick escapes custody shortly after their crash landing, the crew believes they are in grave danger.  They are right; danger lurks right around the corner, but that danger is far graver than Riddick alone.  The crew soon realizes that this lifeless planet is on the verge of a total eclipse, and the creatures that are waiting to come out upon nightfall are ravenous and looking to feast.<br /><br />I remember when I first saw `Pitch Black' is was put off.  I was expecting a high octane action film with large amounts of gore and special effects.  `Pitch Black' is not like that though.  The film is more along the lines of `Alien' than `Jurassic Park'.  This is a film about fear and suspense as apposed to bloodshed and over stylized creatures.  Don't get me wrong, there is a high body count and there are some very interesting and effective looking aliens but they are not the focus.  In fact, you don't even get a good look at the aliens until halfway through the movie, and the actual `action' sequences of the film don't hit until the film is about the end, but the constant feeling of dread follows you from the opening of the film until the credits begin to roll; and then some.<br /><br />There is a scene when the group is traveling across the barren planet in the dense darkness with just a dim light guiding them and keeping them safe from the imposing creatures.  In that scene we can see the aliens crowding at the outskirts of that light, keeping just far enough away for not be bothered yet close enough to make their presence known.  That scene defines well the overall feel of this film.  As the audience we know that death is right around the corner, just beyond our line of vision.<br /><br />The acting is actually very well done here.  Vin Diesel is obviously built for action films, but he demonstrates a decent understanding of character development, allowing his rough exterior to give way to a nicely crafted criminal who is understandable and believable.  I think that Cole Hauser has a decent chance at becoming a great movie star.  I see that potential in him, although I am let down by his consistently mediocre selection of film projects.  Here he is outstanding as the drug-riddled cop Johns and delivers my favorite performance in the film.  Radha Mitchell has turned into the best actor of the bunch.  Her performance here as ship captain Carolyn Fry is strong and respectable, but what she's done with her career since is even more commendable.  Her strong performances in `Finding Neverland', `Man on Fire' and most notably Woody Allen's `Melinda and Melinda' have proven her to be a very reliable actress who is moments from `household name' status.<br /><br />In the end I have to say that I am pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoy `Pitch Black'.  While I was turned off upon my initial viewing (I was young and naïve and expecting something different) upon subsequent viewings `Pitch Black' surpasses what one could hope for and becomes a above average sci-fi film that is effectively horrifying and memorably satisfying.you from the opening of the film until the credits begin to roll; and then some.

B000ICL3KG|2.0|A very well-made and convincing documentary. However, do your homework and you'll find that the global warming scare is ridiculous. Those behind the scare are politicians, celebrities, et cetera. Consult real scientists and researchers, and you'll find that A) Global warming is not man-made, B) Trying to stop climate change is an absurd proposition, and C) Global warming would actually have positive effects.
0452289963|5.0|Eckhart Tolle says in his life-changing book \\"A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life's Purpose\\" that all suffering is caused by our \\"ego.\\" The ego is the identification with our thoughts, emotions, memories, interpretations and opinions. It is our involuntary stream of thinking, reactions, stories, resentments and comparisons. Our ego identity can also be our work, possessions, appearance and accomplishments.<br />Tolle says the ego is the identification with a role to protect and enhance ourselves. The ego cannot distinguish between the situation and our interpretation or reaction. The ego is never at peace with the present as satisfaction is always in the future. The ego's negativity and suffering are motivated by self interest and short sightedness.<br />Armed with Tolle's teachings I began observing my ego in action. To my dismay I saw how my ego always wanted the next thing to react against, to feel annoyed, disturbed or outraged. I realized I was addicted to anger and upset. I had no idea my constant reacting against everything strengthened my ego and sense of self importance. Each time I complained it made me right and the other person wrong.<br />As I became more aware I saw there was something in me that took pleasure in negativity. My ego was a master of selective perception and distorted interpretations. The moment I noticed this there was a shift from ego to awareness. I became more aware of the difference between the event and my reaction to the event. In time I discovered the best way to differentiate between fact and opinion was not through my thinking but my awareness.<br />Tolle says I'm not unique. The collective ego of countries keep grievances to fuel their endless cycle of violence. Throughout history many religions believed they were in sole possession of the Truth and killed those that did not believe their story. Their truth was considered more important than human life.<br />When I stopped feeding my ego's illusions I felt a profound joy and connectedness with all of creation. As my victim identity diminished I stopped seeking people's attention and sympathy. I became more accepting of what happens.<br />Instead of waiting for some change in the future I now enjoy the present. The joy does not come from what I do but flows into what I do. My new awareness allowed the world to become a mirror. The more I loved without conditions the more loving the world appeared. The spiritual realization I am not my thoughts, feelings, body or story but pure consciousness set me free.<br />The other Tolle teachings I found helpful include the awareness of how the ego patterns we react to in others are usually the same patterns in ourselves. How the ego constantly tries to protect and enlarge itself by looking at the world as \\"us\\" versus \\"them.\\" How the ego needs enemies to feel right and superior. What we react to in others we strengthen in ourselves. How the ego sees each person as separate and views them as inferior or superior.<br />How all suffering is ego centered. Ego uses our mind to resist life as it is. The more we make our thoughts, beliefs, story and identity the Truth the more we cut ourselves off from the spiritual dimension within. Spirituality has nothing to do with what we believe and everything to do with our state of consciousness. Since consciousness transcends thought it is the dimension within ourselves that is infinitely more vast than thought.<br />The Holy Spirit is the Truth and it is within all of us. This is what Jesus really meant when he said, \\"I am the way and the truth and the life.\\" Our essence, the Holy Spirit, is the TRUE identity of all humankind and all of creation. When we touch the Christ Within all our actions and relationships reflect the oneness of all life.<br />Our REAL identity is not the voice in our head but our awareness prior to the thoughts, the space in which our thoughts, emotions and sense perceptions happen.<br />Awakening is the realization that who we are is the oneness of life, we are the manifestation of all things, experiences and personalities. It requires a shift of perception from seeing ourselves as an isolated individual to being in everything, everyone and everywhere. It is the realization that we are universal spirit or consciousness. There is no separation anywhere in the the universe. It is a glimpse beyond the veil of duality. When we have no ego we become a conscious Presence, we are not concerned about how others see us, and become one with Life itself.<br />The way to break the ego's negative spell is is to become aware of the ego. Our identity will then shift from ego to awareness. Awareness grows as the ego shrinks. Alertness allows us to detect subtle negativity such as impatience, irritation and nervousness. True self esteem comes when we realize we create our own suffering and rise above the ego's conditioning. Not reacting to our ego is the best way to dissolve our ego. To not react we must see the other person's behavior as coming from their ego. It is not personal. When we look passed the ego to their spiritual essence they too have an opportunity to become more conscious.<br />Non-reaction is forgiveness. It is not a weakness but a strength. Non-reaction does not mean we accept hurtful behavior. There is no ego in informing someone of a mistake so it can be put right. The key is to make a neutral statement, stick to the facts and not complain. Complaining serves the ego not change.<br />Reading a \\"A New Earth\\" helped me stop waiting for some change in the future and enjoy the present.

B00005JNS0|5.0|Had not Lexus thought of it first, Pixar could've adopted the motto \\"the relentless quest for perfection\\" -- especially on this movie. From the story line to the voiceovers to the exquisitely fine details (including the in-jokes) of the animation, CARS is a flat-out winner, and only NASCAR fanatics (of which I am not one) could possibly care that some racing rules are conveniently ignored here and there.<br /><br />I am SO glad that the animators didn't stop at the stiffer, more photo-realistic level of animation we saw in an early trailer; \\"humanizing\\" the cars by giving them the facial and body expressions required comprise just the touch that was needed. Most stunning to me was the near-photo-realistic animation of the mountains, trees and waterfalls in a high pass (which actually made Pixar's rendering farm crash at first) -- it's so breathtaking that it really needs widescreen formatting to do it justice.<br /><br />After I saw it in the theater, I exclaimed, \\"I may never look at a car in the same way again!\\" I'm betting that your whole family will feel the same way.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Well, I have to say, when I heard about this show.....I detested the idea, thought it was gloryfiying serial killers....SWORE I would never watch......happened to be trapped working out and watching TV when a episode came on....I thought Meh....just get it over with....well I was hooked from the first scene....I couldn't hardly wait for the next weeks episode, so I decided to give in to my \\"dark side\\"....lol...and buy the first and second season.  I REALLY like this show, it is slick, entertaining, innovative, well written and acted.....over all as stated in the title this is just a BRILLIANT show and I am really glad I was forced to give it a chance and not miss out on this stellar show!
B000RZGFYS|5.0|I'm in my 30's now, but I still remember the day, back in 1987, when I bought \\"Reign in Blood\\". When I first put the LP on the turntable, I didn't really know what to expect. My previous steps into metal had been Metalica, Megadeth and even Iron Maiden before that (none of which raise my interest nowadays). Slayers previous efforts (other than \\"Hell Awaits\\") were rather low-key affairs, so they just didn't register on my radar enough to want to buy them (until later of course). But after \\"Reign in Blood\\" and it's succeeding \\"South of Heaven\\", there really was no stopping me from descending the steps all the way down to the likes of Napalm Death, Carcass, Burzum and a whole host of other extremes.    But back in 86 / 87 \\"Reign in Blood\\" was a different kettle of fish altogether. It seemed, not much to latch onto an existing vein, as to open up a new one completely. It's hard to remember now, but there really was little out there quite like Slayer or \\"Reign in Blood\\" for that matter, except maybe Bathory and a handful of others. But for many kids Slayer represented the next logical step in the metal genre. More aggressive, faster and darker than what had come before. Of course, there had been the likes of Venom which Slayer had undoubtedly drawn from, but Tom Araya and the boys saw where the path was leading and simply took it, which a lot of bands at the time refused to take.    From the demented Album cover, to the opening attack, right through to the classic rain filled ending, \\"Reign in Blood\\" offered something new and left this listener wanting more. So much so, that I used to flip over the record and play again several times. This CD really is a 5 star opus and I rarely hand out 5 stars on anything.    There is no need to list the tracks in order of approval because every song here is a classic. There really is not a single dud on the whole album and even if some people may find one or two tracks less to their taste than others, but there is nothing here that warrants a skip.    The Def Jam production on the album is a little muddy at times, but it was far superior than most metal bands at the time, such as Bathory's \\"Under the sign of the black mark\\", which in fairness was probably produced at a fraction of the price. But overall it doesn't interfere was the quality on offer and everyone's contribution from Araya's shouting vocals and bass, to King and Hanneman's insanely fast guitars to lombardo's stunning drumming is clear enough to be fully appreciated.     Slayer, of course won't appeal to everyone, but \\"Reign in Blood\\", like The Smiths \\"The Queen is Dead\\", The Pixies \\"Surfer Rosa\\" or Carcass's \\"Synphonies of Sickness\\" should be in every serious music collection for many different reasons. This is a 5 Stars, 10 out of 10, A+, (whatever guage you want) record.

B0007MVXQG|5.0|After releasing two mediocre albums with Tim Owens, Judas Priest has managed to prove there are no wrinkles in a band that has been around for decades.  Angel of Retribution is one of those albums worth buying not just because it is Judas Priest, but because the songs are too good to be marred by the cyber-monster called piracy.

B0010X8NF0|5.0|About three immature brothers who plan a spiritual journey with the aid of the Indian backdrop, opiate cough syrup, and pain killers.  Inevitably, things start to go wrong because they have their hearts in the wrong place with the wrong intentions and a lot of old mental baggage they have been carrying around starts to become apparent.  They discover, more or less, that a real spiritual journey begins without any plans, intentions, aides, etc. The catalyst for the true spiritual journey is an incident where the brothers witness and become involved in a child drowning. The film is not without it's humor though. One part that I found hilarious was the train they were riding got lost and one brother asks the obvious, \\"How does a train get lost?!\\". Some old school camera techniques from the 70's are once again revived and quite effective and add some strange humor to the movie.  I purchased this film and find it enjoyable to watch.  A sort of bitter-sweet tale where you can just sit back and relax and let happen.
B000G759LW|5.0|\\"Makes Me Wanna Pray\\" it just makes you wanna get out of your chair and dance.<br /><br />\\"Ain't No Other Man\\" I was excited when I heard this song, Christina had been saying that this CD was gonna be a throwback to the early jazz days. It's a great song that fuses pop/jazz.<br /><br />\\"Understand\\" This is my favorite song on the entire CD Why was this never released as a single?!?!?!<br /><br />\\"FUSS\\" It stands fro F*** You Scott Storch, the man who co-wrote several songs on the \\"Stripped\\" CD I guess they had a falling out. Christina, you're better than this.<br /><br />\\"Candyman\\" Such a fun dance pop number, it kinda reminds me of \\"Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy\\" mixed with Lou Bega's \\"Mambo #5\\" The video is fun to watch-like a candystore come to life. I'm still confused why radio didn't accept this song. Maye cuz there's no rapper on it?<br /><br />\\"Nasty Naughty Boy\\" is seductive, I imagine strippers dancing to this one on the pole! \\"I'll be the first to blow... your mind\\"<br /><br />\\"Hurt\\" Again beautiful ballad. Strong vocals, lots of emotion.<br /><br />RCA only released 3 songs from this CD. WHY??? Two CDs full of songs and only 3 songs?! So many pop stars rush out albums but Christina takes her time and releases good quality music. I can't wait to see what she does next!
B000F8DB4O|5.0|bottom line - not one bad song on the disc.  what's more, tracks 1-3 are great.  track 4 is out of this world, a spiritual experience.  it moved me nearly to tears as i listened to it while driving through some incredibly beautiful scenery on my way to work this morning up here in north central washington state.  what a treat!

B00013RC8O|5.0|The original Vanishing Point (not 'updated' 1997 version) lives up to its name of being one of the classic cinematic car chase movies. Through subtle poignant tones is the story of a man known simply as Kowalski racing against the clock and himself on mission that becomes all too clear as the movie unfolds.     Super Soul (Cleavon Little, Blazing Saddles) is a blind black disc-jockey who appoints himself Kowalski's spiritual co-pilot much to despise of law enforcement promotes Kowalski to an ever increasing audience who listen in and follow him on his journey with destiny. 30+ years later this is still a movie that will leave more than an impression of watch and forget as this is an example of a car chase film that has a story line you will not easily forget.    Note previous comment re 'updated' 1997 version of Vanishing Point that re-edits the original 1971 movie footage to replace Cleavon Little (R.I.P 1939-1992) with Brett Priestly (Beverly Hills 90210) as Super Soul inserts into the story line a pregnant wife, mobile phones and a heavy metal soundtrack, enough said.
B0000028RR|5.0|Combining political punk attitude with heavy metal riffs and intelligent rap lyrics, Rage Against The Machine broke the mold. Not since bands like [[ASIN:B000002PAW Steppenwolf]], the [[ASIN:B000005IS1 MC5]], [[ASIN:B00004BZ04 The Clash]] and the [[ASIN:B000002KIE Sex Pistols]] has there been a more politically conscious band. And talk about a great debut album.  The lyrics are fiery with passion and conviction and clearly state the band's left-wing, socialist beliefs. But there's more to this music than advertising their political beliefs. They cheer on the every man, condemn bigotry and willful ignorance, support feminism and strongly encourage people to speak their minds (regardless of your political stance). Some have criticized the band, saying that they are hypocritical. And even as a die-hard fan, I admit that there is some credence in these claims. After all, for a band that supposedly despises capitalism their merchandise costs a fortune. But all of that aside, I completely agree with most of what they're saying and I hope that they'll put out another album in the near future, especially considering the current state of our nation. We need more bands that are willing to put it all on the line and not only express their personal beliefs and feelings but share with us their insight into a society whose people are becoming more and more apathetic.  Now to get to the actual details concerning this disc. It contains 10 incendiary tracks that burn into your social awareness. Among them are the modern classics: Bombtrack, Killing in the Name, Know Your Enemy, Wake Up & Freedom. This album was their first major label release and probably their best. It has all that you could want in a band. No boundaries, no borders, no limitations; just a healthy dose of rage, rock and revolution.    Songs include:  1. Bombtrack  2. Killing in the Name  3. Take the Power Back  4. Settle for Nothing  5. Bullet in the Head  6. Know Your Enemy  7. Wake Up  8. Fistful of Steel  9. Township Rebellion  10. Freedom    So turn up the bass and prepare yourself for a fusion of political punk, funk, rock, rap, and metal!

1582701709|5.0|I am simply astounded at the negative responses to The Secret. Astounded. As a pretty intellectual person, someone most would call successful and astute, I see a lot of projection occuring with the negative remarks. People who hate themselves and want company.<br /><br />I'm incredulous that this DVD or book has not been read and then given to your friends, family members, and colleagues. But obviously that IS what has been done because this book and DVD has set records upon records of sales. This book promotes optimism and appreciation, two of the three characteristics of successful people. The other is action.<br /><br />The fellow who went through and applied Cialdini's six principles of influence to The Secret's contents speaks about them as if they were negatives! The truth is that Byrne just used smart marketing. I suggest this person implement the principle of reciprocity by ordering a copy for a friend. The relationship will be better off because of it.<br /><br />And oh my gosh, you mean they want to speak about The Secret and then have coaching as a follow-up? Blasphemy! Or is it what the public wants and needs right now?<br /><br />To the lady who says that Byrne says to turn her back on \\"fat\\" people, I'd ask her to prove that it says that specifically in the DVD or book. What it DOES say is that 'birds of a feather flock together'. If you want to quit smoking, quit hanging out with smokers. If you want to quit doing stupid stuff, quit hanging out with people who do stupid stuff. If you want to be positive, hang out and socialize with positive people. If you would like to read a great book on how the most important facet of change is the social environment, please see Change or Die by Alan Deutschman.<br /><br />Please don't let the negative comments seen in other reviews here impair your interest in this fantastic piece of literary art. Why do you think so many have been to the Web site, Oprah and Larry King have interviewed the authors, so many books and DVDs have been sold, and the buzz continues? It's because people are craving optimism in this increasingly negative world.<br /><br />And for those of you who go to church where they are saying \\"burn this book\\", you need to educate your pastor or preacher. This isn't anti-Christianity. It's pro-Christianity. If you pray, you are implementing The Secret.

It reinforces what He parabalized in the Bible.<br /><br />Can you be successful by just wishing it to be so? No. Will positive things happen in your life if you lock yourself in a room and start praying? No. The bottom line is that you need to take action.

B000068IEU|5.0|If you are into Asian revenge movies you will probably love this movie as I did.  You have to take into consideration this movie is an old one and the quality of the film reflects that.  However, as a whole, it is very good.      Two attractive young girls are on their way to attend a rock concert.  They make a detour to try to score some pot.  They unwittingly approach the son of an escaped convict to see if he has any drugs.  The son leads them back to a hotel room where his father, a male friend (another escapee) and a woman are hiding from authorities.  Both girls eventually are raped and murdered with one of the girls getting gutted with a knife in one nauseating scene.  The film has a relevant message and that is, \\"don't do drugs!\\"  One of the victims is an innocent young girl who makes a wrong choice and ends up at the wrong place at the wrong time which costs her her innocense and her life.      I don't classify this as a horror film because it doesn't really fit that genre as much as it does the revenge genre.   The movie starts out rather slow and meandering but then the pieces of the plot start falling together like a string of dominos and is rather riveting.     If you like revenge movies, this is a good one.  Don't hesitate to add it to your collection.

I found this movie had a cute sense of humor and an interesting way of bringing a family together. the color was all about India and it had some bald spots on the theme and carry through.

B000NA1OXY|4.0|OK, it's not like her 2 previous albums, it's not a 'milestone' in music history, no doubts about it.  But in its genre it's a good album indeed !  It's a party album, to dance, to jump, to sing along, to express all one's energy.. the pop side surely takes over the punk one.  Apart from a couple of tracks there's no serious or deep lyrics at all.  The only track I actually don't like is 'When you're gone', too sugary and corny; in the same mood it would have been better to put 'I will be' instead.    I really don't understand the people not liking this album only because is a 'light' one.  And come on, Avril Lavigne has never been a Bob Dylan or a Leonard Cohen..    As someone once said: it's just rock and roll but I like it !
B000INAXGU|5.0|Man, I've been a fan of Jamiroquai since the first album, technically because I heard the first single from the second album first.  Then, while at The Fugees concert waiting for Goodie Mob to start the show back in 1995 in Boulder, the theater was playing, \\"Emergency...\\" over the sound system.  I was like who the hell is this singing?!  It reminded me of some stuff old heads used to play when I was younger.  Cool vibe to it, but couldn't pronounce the name.  Well, the classics didn't stop there, evidentially, because High Times is one of the BEST best of collections made!  I bought it because of the more edgy single version of \\"Space Cowboy\\" and it's the unedited version!  After my first listen, I went back and pick one CD I didn't like very much and realized I didn't give \\"Funk Oddessy\\" hardly a chance.  I can't get \\"Love Foolosophy\\" outta my head and it was on that album.  I'm givin' another chance.  The last two songs on here are the new joints and maybe a glimpse of what's to come from Jason and the band.  This is an excellent collection of singles and I hope to hear more from them soon.<br /><br />BTW, if you've ever heard of Vaughn Mason (mostly known for a cut called \\"Bounce, Rock, Skate, Roll,\\") try listening back at that cut from back in the day and tell me Jay Kay don't sound a lot more like Vaughn than Stevie Wonder.  It would make more sense, too, because that was a funky disco jam.  It's okay to compare Jay with the legendary Stevie, that makes him great, also.  Just listen to the song and leave me a comment or two.<br /><br />A quick recommendation for you to listen to if you haven't heard 'em yet.  Check out a '70's band called Real Thing, also from London.  These guys, I believe, may be one of Jamiroquai's biggest influences.  I listened to the best of album yesterday and was impressed.  Didn't know much about them until now, but the second CD in this anthology is really good!  Pick it up, you won't be upset.  [[ASIN:B0000516VI Children of the Ghetto: The Pye Anthology]]logy]]

0743298039|5.0|This is a fascinating and rich Gothic mystery about a young Englishwoman who is hired to write the biography of a famous, dying author. The author has always kept her past a secret from her millions of fans, and the biographer is about to find out why. The young woman moves into the old author's home in the remote English countryside, and spends the ensuing weeks compiling details of the author's bizarre and disturbing early years. As the dying author tells that one final tale, her biographer finds herself working through some of her own demons. Interestingly, the biographer's demons at times bear an uncomfortable resemblance to the ones she is writing about for her employer.<br /><br />THE THIRTEENTH TALE is a modern-day story, but it is written in an old-fashioned, Gothic style that takes its time to reveal its many secrets. It includes all the elements of a classic Gothic novel: a crumbling haunted house, English moors, dense fog, and a young heroine who finds herself in a potentially dangerous situation. It is gripping, at times frightening, and always interesting. I was kept guessing about how the story would eventually be resolved, and was pleased by how skillfully the author pulled all of the pieces together.<br /><br />My biggest complaint about THE THIRTEENTH TALE is that the main character felt somewhat one-dimensional. It is possible, however, that the characterization might have been intentional. The main character has been damaged by her own past, so maybe this was demonstrated by making her seem less-than-complete. In any case, that is a minor complaint for the book because many of the other characters are so well drawn.<br /><br />This is an excellent book for readers who like a good, unusual mystery. There was even a happy ending for those characters who were capable of enjoying happy endings. Be warned, though, that this novel is written for adults. Its dreaded \\"adult themes\\" include (vague, not graphic) references to incest, sex, and children born out of wedlock, as well as (explicit) mental illness. But if you're willing to overlook those issues, this is a great story and a fascinating mystery for older readers.<br /><br />Reviewed by:  K. Osborn Sullivanas (explicit) mental illness.

B000YGP6YU|4.0|In October, 2007, \\"Live at Fingerprints Warts & All\\" was released, an 8 track live in-store performance, recorded in late 2006, and focusing equally on his \\"O\\" and \\"9\\" albums. Only a month later this release came out of the blue, another short live album.<br /><br />\\"Live at Union Chapel\\" (8 tracks; 36 min.) was recorded in 2003 on the \\"O\\" tour, and hence focuses on that album, with 5 tracks: \\"Delicate\\", \\"The Blower's Daughter\\", a ferocious \\"Volcano\\", \\"Amie\\", and the traditional \\"Silent Night\\", an astounding a-capella version by vocalist Lisa Hannigan. The remainder songs on here are non-album tracks \\"Then Go\\" and \\"Baby Sister\\" and \\"Be My Husband\\". Let me be upfront and state unequivocally that this is a superb collection of songs: Damien Rice and his band are in peak form throughout. (It's regretful that Lisa Hannigan's role on the \\"9\\" was severely dimished, in my opinion).<br /><br />For my money, if the choice is between \\"Live at Fingerprints\\" or this, there is no contest: \\"Live at Union Chapel\\" wins hands down. But why this release only has 8 tracks, I haven't a clue, and it's a shame. This could have been a 5 star release, but I can't rate it more than 4 stars because of the startling lack of additional material (only 36 min. long?). And why this is released now (as opposed to, say, 2004), again no clue. That said, if you have a chance to see Damien Rice in concert, do not miss the opportunity! I saw Damien and the band (including Lisa) here in Cincinnati in Spring 2004 on the \\"O\\" tour and it was a most memorable evening. For that reason alone \\"Live at Union Chapel\\" is an excellent memento of that for me.
0679731369|3.0|Julian Barnes is a fine writer and talented translator (from French to English). In Flaubert's Parrot, a slim volume that is nonetheless quite richly seeded, Barnes employs a number of narrative devices including running commentaries, as it were, by Flaubert himself and various cronies, and an actual narrator in the form of Dr. Geoffrey Braithwaite. Unfortunately, the good doctor is a royal pain in the arse, and it is difficult to see what really useful purpose he serves by continually forcing himself upon the reader, as is his wont. In fact, this is a case, at times, of severe narratorial (sic) intrusion, and at its worst, it is most tedious, most tedious indeed.    This, then, is a work which often aspires to something like the greatness of the writer whose life is central to its literary plan, but continually runs out of puff since Dr. Braithwaite, one of the most boring characters you could ever hope to meet, insists on getting his prattle in every now again. I enjoyed large sections of this book; however, in spite of its slimness, in the end, I was unable to finish it.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|I've got to admit, I wasn't much of a fan of John Mayer's first album.. When he came out, unfortunately I didn't give him a chance because all I kept thinking was \\"Oh, it's Dave Matthews Redux\\"..  ...Then \\"Heavier Things\\" came out.. a few songs really got to me and my attitude started changing.. ..THEN came 'TRY!\\".. I was blown away.. completely..<br /><br />Because of this, I ran out and bought \\"Continuum\\" the first week it was out.. WOW..! I was so impressed right from the git-go..<br /><br />Continuum is an album full of mid-to-slow tempo songs that never come off as ballady, cheesy, or over blown.. This album isn't blues, it isn't soul, it isn't soft-rock, it isn't pop rock..  this album IS John Mayer. It's him.. it's his heart, his soul.. It's one of those rare albums where we get to see the artists for what they truly are, and \\"Continuum\\" brings it all to the forefront.<br /><br />Lyrically, the songs talk of his 'beliefs' surrounding politics, love, loss, growing old, happiness... Though all of that has been done before, here he conveys those emotions all with a sense of whit and humor sorely missing in most music.<br /><br />Musically, we see that John is a natural. He has the uncanny ability that most guitarst can't do to make his guitar sing to you, make a statement.. Almost as if it's an extention of himself. But vocally, he has just as an important impact with his intimate tone which never sounds forced. The songs themselves are mid-tempo that border on the blues (just based on his gutiar style), but adding the funky laid back drumming of Steve Jordan and the solid melodic bass playing of Pino Paladino takes the songs to a groving commercially acceptable plain that all other blues artists don't realize they can go to. Add on top his pop vocal abilities, and you've got a very unique album..<br /><br />In summation, it's great. The songwriting is great, lyrics, music, but above all, vocal and musical performances are what makes this album so important. I'm so thankful that this album exists in a time where musicians aren't actually musicians at all.. it's to show them that, well, they really don't know what they are doing.. so start learning! ;o)<br /><br />Thank you, John.. for this album. Keep it up, you deserve everything that comes your way..

B000058T5J|5.0|I was just surfing through some of the miles davis albums and am beyond surprised to see \\"Live-Evil\\" scoring a measly two stars!    This album is where its at! Just as Gary Bartz says in the liner notes, this is the time during Mile's career where he had never played harder. These tracks are rockin, funky, and some of the most layered and interesting fusion music that I have ever heard!    Tell me that you listened to \\"What I Say\\" and couldn't almost taste that energy and chemistry coming from the musicians. And \\"Funky Tonk\\" is just plain funk. What with Kieth's awesome piano solo at the end... I mean one must remember that these tracks were basically composed on the spot at the Cellar Door on night on Dec. 19th, 1970.    Lets not forget that guitar work by mclaughlin... or that spacy yet interesting, yet funky drumming of Jack Dejohnette, with Airto filling in all the gaps with a chiefly African syncopation..    Certainly the tunes \\"little church\\", \\"nem um talvez\\", and \\"selim\\" are not at all your typical miles. But I believe that they represent an entirely different direction for mile's music focusing on the power of transcendence.    For those of you who gave this a bad review, I can assume that you are purists, or felt that it didn't live up to \\"Bitches Brew\\", but lets be realistic here, I haven't heard a song as rockin' as \\"What I Say\\" since Jimi Hendrix released \\"Voodoo Chile (SLight Return)\\" in 1968........
B000WGWQG8|5.0|The timing couldn't be better to tell the story of the American Revolution through the eyes of John Adams than in an election year!  I spent the first 34 years of my life in Philadelphia. Being raised and immersed in the city's rich history is second nature to most natives, and the HBO series was not something new to be learned, but a reminder of something always known, just relegated to the background of consciousness.  The angst and indecision of the Founding Fathers whether to break from England, the hardships and diseases they endured because of that decision; even (perhaps especially) their repugnance at holding the Congressional Congress in Philadelphia, gave new dimension to a story that's been told over and over again. Times may change but people don't, and that is a reason not to despair, but to take heart and create our own timeless story.

B00011F5DK|5.0|This game is a real hit in our family.  I bought this game for my daughter's 7th birthday and she just loves it - she says is \\"addictive\\".       It is one of the very few games I have played that is challenging and fun for all ages. My kids play it with my husband and I and their grandparents and we are all challenged.   Being older does not mean you have an advantage in this game! Right now my 10 year old and 7 year old are the ones to beat.     The rules are fairly simple and yet it is a great thinking game.  There are also several variations depending on the number of players you have - you can even play this game by yourself.    Makes a terrific game to have in your household and to give as a gift.

Perhaps I'm in too bad a place to listen to songs that are slower.  In any event, they remain one of my favorite bands and even if they do resemble Nickelback, why would I care?

B000GCFO0I|1.0|I'm paraphrasing here but Kurosawa once said that if you have a great director, great editor, great cinematographer and a great cast but have a bad script then you will have a bad movie. This film is a great example to back up this statement. This film has some of the best visual effects out there, good editing, good cinematography, occasionally good soundtrack but an absolutely horrible screenplay. What happened? I wish I knew but could only guess that what we saw was the end result of a rough draft. Somewhere hidden in there might have been a good idea and it seems that unless you played the games it might be difficult to pin point exactly what that good idea was.    In order for a movie to be good it should not require an outside source (video game, comic book, novel or TV show) to hold it up. Some of the best films out there were based off of another medium, Spiderman 1 and 2, X-MEN 1 and 2, Batman Begins, Lord of the Rings (this list could actually go on forever), I even enjoyed the first Mortal Kombat. Obviously you don't have to agree with the titles I just mentioned, they're just opinions but the point is that these films don't require you to be familiar with the source material. The films actually stand on their own without that familiarity. There's nothing wrong with the director tipping his hat to memorable scenes that originate within the game as a wink towards the fan. What is wrong is when the director is not able to translate the games narrative into film for the non-fans. If he were successful in translating the game into film the non-fans would want to play the game! In this case Gans failed to do just that.    Is the movie hard to understand? No, because the main point of the plot, that is, the motivating factor for the characters in the plot is spelled out for you in the last 10 or so minutes of the film in the form of a flash back with running commentary. I can't help but think that the logic behind this plot structure is to make you feel like you've painstakingly played a video game and now you will be rewarded with a reason as to why you have played the game in the first place or why you sat for almost two hours wondering why Rose (the mother character for those who have not seen it yet) didn't take the kid to a doctor instead of taking her to an allegedly haunted town that is to this day burning underneath. The point is that this type of exposition is just plain lazy writing. That kind of information is typically (not always but in this way it is more challenging for the writer and allows for interactivity from the audience) leaked throughout the film with the use of action, dialogue, metaphors so when the payoff happens there is no need for an explanation.    Tension is caused by expectation, you expect something terrible to happen based off the clues that have been given to you throughout the course of the film. Sometimes the audience knows more than the main character raising the bar for tension. In other words you know what's coming before the character does causing the audience to scream the typical, \\"don't go into that room\\" or \\"Don't open that door\\" or just simply scream. Alfred Hitchcock has a better explanation as to how it works but the point is that tension is caused by expectation. Now putting aside the information that the fans are familiar with from the game, the movie itself does not clearly place any clues for the audience to create that tension. The clues that are presented are a mystery in of themselves. Although we eventually learn of the witch hunters origin and eventually, after the infamous flashback, we learn the story of Alessa, without some form of previous information placed earlier in the film it's difficult for most to see any of that coming. Therefore, the director literally has to hold our hands throughout the film for us to understand why anything is happening. But yes, by the end of the film you are TOLD everything and technically you should be able to walk out of the film\\"getting it\\". However, in this case, to \\"get it\\" was not fun.    I'm not going to argue about this being one of the best VG adaptations out there because it probably is. But unfortunately that's not saying much.    What I'm saying is I love video games and I really wanted to enjoy this film. Besides, I'm a huge fan of Brotherhood of the Wolf and based on that alone I thought this film was going to be great. I thought it was going to do for video games what X-MEN and Spiderman was doing for comics, people were finally going to look at it as a serious form of entertainment and not a mindless activity that most critics have labeled it as such. Unfortunately, in this case it did not do any of those things. Even worse, it seems, based on the number of the games fan responses in this forum, the film has isolated itself to the entertainment of only them, thereby alienating itself from the rest of the public and some are okay with this! That's not a good thing and you fans of the game should know that money ultimately rules this industry. If this film does not profit it will scare off the studios from not only making sequels of this movie but ultimately making future adaptations of other games. And there are a lot of games out there that deserve to be made into films.

The remastering is superb.

Everything about it is perfect:  the actors, the dialogue, the cinematography, the production design, the costumes . . . It is true to the novel in respect to plot, characters, and dialogue but there is a sweetness that touches the heart and uplifts the spirit that is somewhat missing in the book.

I simply can't identify with people who live such shallow, self-centered lives.<br /><br />I'm sure the author of 'Shifting Fog' will be delighted to be compared to Jane Austin -- and good for her.  Nevertheless, this book affects me the same way Austin's did -- a consummate bore.<br /><br />That said, I know very well that there are tens of millions of people who will love this book, glory in its romance, delight in the (modest) fates of each and every character, revel in the restraint and serenity.

B000YABYLA|3.0|Who would spend $150 on Tic-Tacs for their nerd boyfriend? No one.<br /><br />Juno was a simple film. In a more perfect world there would be dozens of such films made every year. Since so much schlock gets made then this film stands out to many as some sort of minor masterpiece. It was not. It was just a simple film. Because of all the praise I came to it expecting a bit more.<br /><br />Juno is a 16 year old girl going on 46. She was way too worldly. There was nothing she did not know. She never seemed upset about her situation except once. She also used the word \\"cavalier\\". I could not help but wonder how many 16 year old girls know Iggy and the Stooges, Thundercats, and use the word cavalier. I am betting zero. Of course now they all know, because they have seen this film.<br /><br />The film also made light of a rather serious problem. The only reason I could discern for this was to make young pregnant girls who are afraid and insecure feel a bit more empowered.<br /><br />Ultimately the film was overwritten and could not make up it's mind if it wanted to be Napolean Dynamite or Kramer VS Kramer. It needed more focus and less silliness. Or more silliness and less reality. Either way it was middle of the road and did nothing too shocking, hence it's mass appeal. When the protagonist is in a bind and is cocky and sure, well that is not reality. If her attitude was meant to be defensive, then no other side was ever shown, except when she found out she might not have someone to give the baby too. That was too late in the film for a breakdown as far as I am concerned.<br /><br />Thank God nothing happened with her and the adoptive father. For a bit it was leaning that way and that would have been a disaster.<br /><br />This film is not going to ruffle many feathers because it does not go to all the places it could or should have.<br /><br />3 stars for effort, good acting, and witty remarks. Soundtrack and photography were decent and above par for a small film like this.
B000ASDFJU|5.0|So glad I finally purchased this.  Comes in a beautiful pink velvet case with all of the discs as well as a brief summary of each episode.  Great show to pop in whenever; love it!!
0141439688|5.0|This book answered a lot of questions that came up after I saw the movie i.e. what's with Mrs. Clay and the young Mr. Elliot?  A must read if you really want to understand the movie.

B000784WMW|5.0|Timothy Dalton, although too tall for Rochester, was outstanding! What a hunk, but more than that, his acting was tremendous!  Zelah grows on you.  She also did an outstanding job. My husband and I watch this, our favorite movie, over and over again!
0743529030|2.0|If you have never read or heard any of this type of material in the past, then this book may be worthwhile. I felt that this book really lacked content in terms of managing our thinking and applying thinking principles to acheive success; the book mearly illustrates that thinking big is a pre-cursor to acting big, then it goes into a repackaged presentation of Dale Carnegie material - dealing with people.
B00102F5WK|4.0|Extraordinary Rendition: the clandestine government practice of transferring suspected terrorists to countries to have them torrured for information.<br /><br />It has been well-established that the United States allows the practices shown in this film that it was very difficult to sit through the film.<br />The film documents how we as a nation have allowed our government to disregard due process rights and the rule of law.  Because of practices like this, our country has forfeited the moral high ground.  Politics are seamlessly woven into the story, without making it feel like a piece of propaganda, making it an effective political thriller.  The movie operates at a good clip.  It depicts things that have happened and probably still happen.  There is no politically correct white-washing of just how scary radical Islam is.  The scenes of the young Muslim men being indoctrinated into hate and violence actually made me say \\"whoa\\" outloud.  The movie also showed how when we torture (maybe sometimes innocent people) to get barely useful information out of them, we only end up making more enemies for ourselves.<br /><br />Reese Witherspoon gives a great performance.  Gone is her quirky, cutesy Legally Blonde persona. Meryl Streep, is well, Meryl Streep!  She's amazing.  While I am not usually a fan of Jake Gyllenhaal, he's pretty good too.  The performances by Omar Metwally and Yigal Naor are also outstanding.
B000JLSM00|5.0|Of course the movie, The Searchers, that is one of the best of all time is a 5-star rating.  While the history of this John Wayne and John Ford movie is well documented, it cannot be understated how powerful of a performance John Wayne leaves in this movie.  With the well documented history of this great movie, I shall turn to this Blu-Ray edition.<br /><br />I am impressed with the quality of the picture for a movie of this age.  The colors are radiant and vibrant.  I find the image to be sharp, and I am impressed with picture quality.  Let me be clear though, this is not a perfect reproduction.  For a film of it's age, should perfection of picture be expected?  Upon close examination, some of the grainy/fuzziness can be discerned.  It does not take away from this edition.<br /><br />The audio is just ok.  Not bad, not good.  As noted, it is 1.0.  While the audio does not stand out, I did not find the audio to detract from the movie either.<br /><br />Overall, I find this Blu-Ray to be an excellent edition.  I am glad that it is a part of my movie collection.
006097625X|3.0|Understanding Comics is a very, very deep dive into the history, meaning and creative processes involved in creating comics. The author, Scott McCloud, has clearly studied his topic. You will not walk away from reading this book without a deeper appreciation for the medium.<br /><br />Yet, I found I lost interest pretty quickly in what the book was teaching. There are four reasons for this. First, I was thrown by the fact that the book, itself, is a comic. I can count on, well, one finger how many comics I've read that attempt to convey scholarly information. While Mr. McCloud's illustrations are very well drawn, the medium itself caused me to expect a lighter approach to the subject matter. Second, the author occasionally goes beyond teaching to preaching. Third, many of the book's concepts are confusingly conveyed. For example, Mr. McCloud uses a pyramid to show the range of different comic authors' styles. Unfortunately, this explanatory vehicle is hard to follow to start with, let alone when it's abbreviated and repeated quite often in subsequent pages. Fourth, Mr. McCloud goes on too long with some of his arguments. I often felt the urge to skim or skip past particularly long discourses where little new information was being added to earlier information provided.<br /><br />If you're looking for a deep, scholarly analysis of comics, this book is for you. If you're looking for an easy to read, interesting new perspective on comics, you will probably not enjoy this book.
B0000AM6JI|4.0|Here's another great example of Pacino and DePalma working together after the infamous \\"Scarface\\". It took me a few viewings (as it does with any movie)to grab a hold of the guts of this film and the great directing work and the great acting as well. The film starts out with a bang and really grabs your interest, but it slacks off after that for a while until the first plot point which is about 35 minutes in. Then it grabs hold of you and sucks you in. Leading to a great climax and resolution. The climax is one of the best chase scenes ever done. The choreography of the action, unique and witty uses of the steadicam, and the awesome camera angles with clean, quick, editing, entice me to make a statement like that. You think you know the ending when the film starts but a clever twist leaves you thinking.<br />  As with all of my reviews, I am a movie maker, not a movie goer. An average individual watching this for the first time might turn it off halfway through. Bad decision. The preformance by Pacino may seem sub-par by most people, but it's my belief, he plays the role well and has a great vision of Carlito's lifetime after prison and how easily one can get caught right back up in things. He progressesw through it well.<br />This is Brian DePalma, Martin Bregman, and Al Pacino together again, for what would be, one of the last films they would all take part of. Not as intense as Scarface, but if you liked that film this one might prove interesting. The screenplay was adapted from a couple of novels, (which I never like) so at times it's trying to cover to much in a small space of time. It's a rather lengthy film and definitely has it's slow moments. If you've read the books, \\"Carlito's Way\\" and \\"After Hours\\"\\" written by Edwin Torres you probably might not care much for this film. But if you're a fan of Al Pacino, and watch it through a few times, I guarentee you'll love it.
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|Set on an estate in England, this hilarious movie about the  funeral of a family member will bring tears to your eyes,  (i.e. tears from laughing)!

B000000OMP|4.0|This album forms the transition between the early, bluesy, Bad Co./Paul Rogers sounding Whitesnake that came before, and the flashy-guitar, Led Zeppish hair metal we all heard on the radio in America in the late 80's.  The overall effect is a solid, somewhat bluesy mid 80's British hard rock.  I've found this CD grew on me over time - it's a little more solid rockin' than the early days (which I now prefer, though) and a little more feeling and bluesy than the flashy later albums.    I have found out recently that there was a different version released in Britain first, with original guitarist Micky Moody and more organ (by the best organist in rock, Jon Lord - who, however, kind of sits back in his days w/ Whitesnake), which might be preferred by the fans of the earlier era of the band.    A note on the lyrics - whereas some bands (e.g. Aerosmith) are known for a bit of sexual-innuendo, Whitesnake really goes over the top, such as song titles like \\"Slide It In\\" and \\"Spit It Out\\" should indicate.  But then, we're talking about a band whose name is a euphemism for \\"wang\\", so what should we expect :)  That being said, Coverdale has a rich, bluesy voice with a lot of feeling and there is a fair amount of emotion in these songs (as well as horniness), and this is the last we hear of him before he goes for that screaming Robert Plant metal style.
B00005KAQP|5.0|I first saw this movie back when my grandmother bought it on VHS in '92. For the first few minutes, I knew I was going to love this movie. It has become one of my favorites since then. Whoopi plays Deloris Van Cartier, who is a Las Vegas lounge singer whose boyfriend is in the local mob. She walks in and sees him killing a previous employer who went to report him to the police. Deloris gets scared immediately, runs away from Vince's (Harvey Keitel) buddies who are told to \\"take care of it\\", meaning kill Deloris. She reports the incident to the police, and the lieutenant gets her into hiding for a short time until Vince goes to trial. Deloris is reluctant, but agrees to go. She is put in a place where Vince wouldn't even think she's at: a convent. She meets with the strict Reverend Mother (played by Maggie Smith), and has to adapt to the simple life of being a nun. She quickly befriends the rest of the sisters, and even manages to help get the convent out of alienation, as well as making the choir sing more beautifully (and even getting a very special visit from the Pope himself several days later). But shortly later on, Vince finds out of where Deloris is, because of some nosy detective, and the terror picks up where it left off. The lieutenant who put her in hiding now has to tell her that she has to leave because Vince knows of where she's at. She gets picked up by Vince's buddies and gets taken to a lounge and Vince is telling the boys to kill her. Deloris manages to get away from the men for a few minutes, and after a while, Vince and his boys are arrested and on their way to prison. Then, Mary Clarence and the rest of the sisters have their special concert at the church, with the Pope in attendance. After the concert, they all get a standing ovation, and the movie ends on a happy note. Filled with interesting scenes as well as great 60s soul music, this movie deserves to be in your personal library. Be sure to get the soundtrack album as well.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Doesn't follow the books word for word, but the interpretation for the at-large audience is very good.  My husband and I very much enjoyed this 1st season and we can hardly wait for the next season to come out.      Some of the characters are drastically different from the book (i.e. Deborah),but all in all very good interpretation.
0920668372|5.0|This book is so sweet!  Every time I have to buy a baby gift for someone having a boy, this is part of it!  I recommend it to anyone looking for a heart-warming gift.
B000002JPA|5.0|Have had this album since it came out, but wasn't quite ready for it yet. Don't know why but I waited a few years before really giving it a listen. And I haven't been the same since. Dream Theater was my first taste of progressive rock/metal, so it took a while for it to all sink in; up to then I'd been accustomed to thrash and Motley Crue type music...not complex at all.<br /><br />This has to be one of their better albums to date (`08), and many agree. So complex and tight, you can tell they've been working on it for a while to try and surpass their first album, `When Dream & Day Unite.' I'd make a safe guess that this album has more snare hits than any of their other albums. Maybe someone will figure it out some day.<br /><br />My favorites are:<br /><br />Pull Me Under - what started it all for me. From the opening notes to the sudden cut-off at the end, this song kicks a$$ in a big way. Very complex, rhythmic, and great vocals too (this is when I could tolerate James LaBrie's style of singing; not so much anymore).<br /><br />Metropolis- Part 1 'The Miracle and the Sleeper' - one of their best songs, ever. Great intro, great lyrics, great drumming, great guitarwork, great everything!!<br /><br />Under A Glass Moon - the more I listen to this song, the more I love it! Great drumming (with one of the easiest and coolest rhythms to play), and I especially love the break that builds up to possibly the BEST guitar solo of anyone, EVER!!<br /><br />Learning To Live - their second best song of all time (the first being `Honor Thy Father'), with the greatest lyrics and vocals of any of their songs (next to `A Change of Seasons'). Love Kevin Moore's keyboard work in this song (the same as `Wait For Sleep'), and great solo's all around!!<br /><br />I really don't see the point of writing a review for this album. Doubt I'll convince anyone who hasn't gotten this one yet to quit farting around and get it. Could over 250 people be wrong about this album? Maybe. But it's a risk everyone should at least try.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This has to be one the most amazing workouts, I have ever done. In 20 minutes you will sweat your butt-off, I used to consider myself to be pretty in shape ( 6 days a week ) I workout, rain or shine. But Jillian puts you through the ringer ( in a good way ) She's extreamly motivating and frankly, I like her. I've needed someone to kick my butt, and she's just the person to do it. I have her whole \\"Biggest Winner\\" ( 5 in a pack ) series too, those aren't disapointing video's either. I trade off days, there's more than enough in there to get in shape. I'm just wondering if I will ever get to levels 2 and 3. LOL
B00006L83N|5.0|Like many others I got this CD on a whim, based on the positive reviews. I've never heard of Symphony X. Had been a longtime Dream Theater fan and didn't want to get sick of them by playing only their music. Needed variety, but wasn't sure where to turn.<br /><br />So I snagged this album and am so glad I did! Haven't listened to an album this good since DT's Images & Words. Every song on here kicks major b-lls! You can definitely hear the influence of other prog. bands, like Dream Theater, Yes, Kansas (they're considered progressive), Queensryche, but also hear a bit of Diamond Darrell influence. What great musicians these guys are!<br /><br />I'll admit that I wasn't too crazy about the vocals at first. Reminded me of Manowar. But I really couldn't picture any other voice to go with this music. Michael Romero's guitarwork is definitely influenced by DT's John Petrucci, though he isn't a rip-off by any means! The drummer, Jason Rullo, is a close second to master-drummer Mike Portnoy; great fills and great rhythms. The keyboardist, Michael Pinnella, reminds me of a cross between Jordan Rudess and Kevin Moore (ex-Dream Theater). I'd dare say that these guys are BETTER than DT, but in reality they're not. Different, but not better.<br /><br />I don't regret getting this CD for a second and if you're a fan of prog. metal then you won't either.
B000WGWQG8|1.0|I won't bore you with a detailed description of this farcical treatment of McCullough's all together excellent book.  But Paul Giammati was NOT the actor to pick for this role -- his performance was pretty much like a hole in the middle of the series.  The camera work went from distracting to downright annoying with all of the crazy angles (either the camera man has one leg shorter than the other, or the director was striving, unsuccessfully, for a dramatic effect).  After watching the second installment, we gave it up.
B00000272N|5.0|I'll never forget listening to these guys on Mtv's Headbangers Ball, while Bruce Dickinson introduced the next video from an unknown band with a puzzled look on his face: \\"Alice In Chains, `We Die Young?'\\" And from then on I was hooked. AIC took me from a thrashing metalhead to a dirty, I-don't-give-a-f-ck attitude sort of kid, much different than the metalheads. Hard to explain.<br /><br />But this album is raw and powerful, lyrically and musically. Yeah, you can hear a few songs on the radio over and over again (Man In A Box, Sea Of Sorrow), but they'll never play the real good ones. They never do! With lyrics like \\"I wanna peel the skin from your face. Before the real you lays to waste,\\" do you blame them?<br /><br />Every song on here (with the exception of Man In A Box, which the radio ruined by playing it over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again!!) is a piece of time and history, from an angry youth; picture it like hippies with attitudes. That's what it was all about.<br /><br />Alice In Chains set the stage for music for years to come, and snuck out the back door before the end of the show. Honored to have \\"known\\" them from the beginning.
B000V1Y43W|5.0|I can't believe the technology of Pixar these days!  The movie's attention to detail and high resolution is absolutely awesome and in HD its worth the upgrade from DVD to Bluray.  Storyline is great as always.
0920668372|1.0|The first time I read this book I thought it was sweet... for the first few pages.  By the time there's a picture of the mom driving with a ladder tied to the roof of her car to climb in her grown son's room my husband looked at me and asked what the heck I was reading.  I could barely finish we were laughing so hard!  I'm so glad to see that there are other people who find this book creepy and ridiculous!  Ours is leaving the house!
B0010V4TZU|2.0|This seems like the kind of thing that a small group of coeds in an average pewter colored euro trash convertible would listen to on a weekend drive up highway 1 while they complained about other people's clothing taste.......
B000022TSY|5.0|I saw this when it first came out, and was blown away.    But hey, that was the 60s, so maybe I was just reacting to the times.    But no.    Twenty years later I was asked to teach a course called \\"The Journey of Life\\" and use it as one of the pieces.    I was afraid it would not hold up.    I am glad to say I was wrong.    It held up splendidly.    It is one of those films that transcends itself.  Despite the shoestring budget and no-name actors (Hopper and Fonda and Nicholson were practically unknown), it pole-vaults into the category of National Myth.    It instantly harks back to one of the elemental themes in America: Seeking Freedom by Hitting the Open Road.    This goes way back--past Kerouac, past Whitman, past Huck and Jim lighting out for the territories, past Ishmael and Queequeg, past Leatherstocking and Chingachkook, past even Hester Prynne and Pearl.    Amazing how this archetype resonates.    The simplicity, the scenery, the topical references (like the parade in the small town; the hippie commune), the strange drug-spirituality in New Orleans, the violence.    Great stuff.

B000WS4PCY|5.0|After seeing the guys do \\"Hallelujah\\" on tv, I was desparate to find the song on CD.  I so disappointed when I heard it wasn't going to be released, and then when I saw it as the \\"B\\" track, I had to get skip a bill and get it!!  I love the way Jon's voice sounds on this song!!!  He would make me sing Hallelujah and AMEN all day!
0060589469|1.0|I didn't read this book when it first came out to rave reviews. Something about all that enthusiasm with no substance behind it made me wary, and rightly so, it seems.    The narrator is a condescending, pompous egotist and I pity his son and his long-suffering friends who got dragged along into this anti-climactic non-dark non-heart of non-darkness.
0452289963|1.0|Is this book a joke? How can so many people like this? Joel Osteen is so much better. This book basically states \\"become a robot with no feelings or identity, and you will be happy too!\\"
B00132D808|4.0|Panic! has completely blown my mind with this album.  Gone is the pop-filled punk sound that brought this group onto the scene.  Pretty.Odd. lives up to its name as the guys went with a much more mellow sound that is less Fall Out Boy and more Guster.  Since I'm also a huge Guster fan, this change is a welcome one, but not at all what I expected when I pre-ordered this one.  Delightful new sound.
B0014Z4OQG|2.0|i bought 'Cloverfield' on dvd today- i'm glad i bought it with points, i'd have been TICKED if i'd paid for it. it didn't completely suck, but if you thought it looked like a really good monster movie you were wrong. i thought so, and was wrong. it was shot in the 'blair witch' style, nauseating shaky camera that never sits still and takes the bold move (for an action flick) of virtually NEVER showing the action. i guess it's supposed to look 'real' but it was just too gimmicky. i garantee there is as much total darkness and/or shots of the sidewalk as anything else. i'd say 40% off centered bad acting, 5% scary monster (just his legs & back, tho... lord knows i HATE seeing the monster in a monster flick, gosh) and the remaining 55% is black sky, black streets, dust, debris... you get the idea. i'd have walked out on it in the theater long before it got to the cool parts.
B00127RAJY|4.0|Some people may find this workout video tedious, with its emphasis on jumping jacks, push ups, and sit ups, but it works.  I've never had any other excercise get my heart rate up as much and there are definately quick results.  There are three different twenty minute workouts that are increasingly difficult.  I would recomend it, especially to those who are having trouble getting results from other workouts.
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|An UNBELIEVABLE terrible movie. The \\"Blair Witch Project\\" directed by Ed Wood!  Save your money...poor acting, lousy plot. The primary \\"monster\\" was the best actor in the whole movie.  I'll never let the pre-movie hype sell me on a movie again.

B00005JMX6|1.0|THE GIRL NEXT DOOR is also another bizarre film that is all the wrong mixture of \\"American\\" sexy - it looks down on porn while trying to be a porn movie ... and ends up mocking itself.     Elisha Cuthbert is a gorgeous woman of course but clearly is out of her league trying to protray sexy. Clearly, she knows she's beautiful and has an effect on men but is incapable of protraying that on screen ... take a look at European actresses like Eva Green or Emmanuelle Beart - they can be vulnerable and sexy dressed in a knight's armor or fierce and fully armoured even if standing around naked. For a porn actress part, she is totally scared to even be nude - no idea why she took this role? But then the producer-director-writer had no clue either - they want to tell us to embrace porn/nudity/sex as natural part of social intercourse but then when it actually comes time to do that, they revert back to sneering and acting childish at nudity.     The bottom line in what the producer-director-writer is really trying to say is that women porn actresses need to be \\"rescued\\" so they can lead normal suburban lives ...  really? Is it still 1962?
B0006GVJEE|3.0|I saw this for the first time On Demand last summer, and it was pretty good, but I was hooked on Oldman's character Stansfield.  Lately we have been casting around for movies to watch, and my husband had never seen this, so I ordered it and we watched it last night.  This version has scenes I don't remember from the summer, so I assume it's somewhat of a director's cut.    The thing is, while Reno is good (and his character is good), it's not enough to carry the movie.  Now, everyone talks about how fabulous Portman was in this movie.  And when I saw it on TV, I did think she was good, although I felt the character of Mathilda was too one-dimensional.  I wasn't emotionally invested in her character, so I didn't really care much about her part of the story. She was just a whiny manipulative kid.     And in this particular version there's even more to dislike.  The extra footage is all Leon and Mathilda.  There's just too much screen time involving only them.  These two characters aren't enough to carry that much screen time.  I found myself embarrassed for having recommended it.    Luckily, that last shootout scene is so amusingly done (and the conflict ends so satisfyingly) that it was worth it in the end, but without Oldman's quirky performance I would never have recommended it for rewatching.
0553573403|5.0|When I began reading A Game of Thrones I was thoroughly excited.  I had read a great deal of the reviews here and knew mostly what I was getting into.  I was prepared for the multiple points of view setup of the books, and I was prepared for the adult content, both sexual and violent (in fact, the fact that these books were written for an adult audience is one of the main reasons I started reading them).<br /><br />However, about 50 or so pages into AGOT, I was feeling let down.  I had just finished reading a majority of the Sword of Truth series and Feist's Riftwar Saga and was expecting a fairly fantastical fantasy book.  Well, that isn't really what AGOT is.  It focuses more upon the character development, familial relations, and political positioning, and almost ignores any sort of fantastical elements; with Wizards, fantastical creatures, and Magic being merely mentioned in the background.<br /><br />This bothered me for a while because I had it in my head that what I wanted to read about would be at least 50% fantasy and magic.  I stayed the course, however, because of the great reviews and am now thoroughly in love with these books.<br /><br />I actually like it better how GRRM makes magic and fantastical creatures a rare and unusual thing in his world.  Because you rarely read anything to do with magic, when it does come into play, it is more mysterious and entertaining than it would be if it were the main focus of the book.  For anyone that has read the Sword of Truth series, magic is the absolute focus of the book.  In fact, everything else takes a back seat.  However, this makes magic fairly mundane, which I don't think it should be.<br /><br />Furthermore, Martin's writing is absolutely superb.  Not only is every character distinct emotionally, but they are also distant in a familial way.  They all have their own ancestors with their own particular and unique histories.  These histories and family traits play a large part in the characters actions and feelings with which you spend so much time.<br /><br />I've never read a fantasy novel with so much political intrigue, deception, and manipulation, and now I wouldn't want it any other way.  The only flaw I see in the series, not including how long it is taking for the \\"fifth\\" book to be released, is that Martin's world seems almost too untrustworthy.  Anyone can be killed at any time, however it is usually the good guys that seem to have the worst things happen to them.  Rarely does anything bad happen to the \\"villains\\" in the story.  With the \\"fifth\\" book being still a ways off, I don't see any way to wrap this series up without having the bad guys on top in some way.  Now I'm not against realism (having the bad guys win), but I also realize that the bad guys don't always win in reality (probably because there are no \\"bad\\" guys, only different situations).  This is not really a flaw, just a depressing fact about the books and my lack of imagination with which to see a way out of the pit of despair Martin has dug for his more noble characters.elings with which you spend so much time.<br /><br />I've never read a fantasy novel with so much political intrigue, deception, and manipulation, and now I wouldn't want it any other way.

0061122416|4.0|Great book for anyone, but especially those trying to find and follow their dreams (read: college students). Combine it with Iain Holligshead's \\"Twentysomething\\" and you couldn't ask for better required reading in the second half of college!
B000E1ZBGS|3.0|This version is okay but not great; too short to do it justice. Great romance movie if you aren't familiar with the book.
B00000255F|5.0|This is simply one of the best 30 years after its release.  I rarely like or listen to every song on an album/CD but this one I can play over and over again.  The writing (words and music) the arrangements and the sound are simply not matched.  A mix of words and music and sound not to be equalled.  As another review stated this is a landmark in music and put the Springsteen name in lights forever.
B000002MFE|5.0|eric clapton is and always will be considered as a guitar legend. and this shows it.     a soothing and uncomplicated production in a very intimate atmosphere, \\"unplugged\\" has a serene sound that will captivate anyone who has ears for good music. i highly recommend listening to it in a good set of stereo system
0156027321|4.0|The Life of Pi - surely an adventure of the mind as much as of the body - is a good book with some great anecdotes. Overhwelmingly sad in parts, it is a page-turner in the closest sense of the word. What it lacks in depth, it more than makes up for in fantastical mystery and heart.
B00000JNO2|4.0|\\"Bullets\\", Lynyrd Skynyrd's fourth album, wasn't a great succes back in 1976. And many reviewers, professional and amateur, apparently consider it the original Skynyrd ensemble's \\"least great\\" album. Generic. Uninspired. Mediocre.  Not me, though. I think it's a wonderful, varied collection of songs, hard rockers, melodic slow and mid-tempo grooves, and effective ballads...better than \\"Street Survivors\\" and better, certainly, than \\"Nuthin' Fancy\\" as well.     I love the clanging pianos and the crunchy riffs, and with the exception of \\"Searching\\", which I've never really learned to love, I don't see a single clunker here. \\"Double Trouble\\" is a bit too predictable, but everything else is top-notch. \\"Trust\\" and the title track in particulat provide some tough, riff-driven hard rock, and songs like \\"Cry For The Bad Man\\" and J.J. Cale's \\"The Same Old Blues\\" groove along on a great combination of effective riffs and a supple rhythm section. Slower tunes like \\"Every Mother's Son\\" and the semi-acoustic country ballad \\"All I Can Do Is Write About It\\" are equally excellent, and \\"Every Mother's Son\\" in particular provide a terrific showcase for the talents of singer Ronnie van Zant.    You may well argue that a few of these songs seem more powerful and vibrant on the live \\"On More From The Road\\", which was recorded during the tour that Skynyrd undertook in support of \\"Bullets\\". And some live versions of \\"The Same Old Blues\\" do indeed outshine this one as well. But the songs certainly don't suck here either, and the two bonus tracks, previously unreleased live recordings of \\"Gimme Back My Bullets\\" and \\"Cry For The Bad Man\\", are a welcome addition, even if the live version of title track can't match the version found on \\"One More From The Road\\". The live \\"Bad Man\\" makes up for it.    Don't let negative or mediocre reviews scare you away from this album (and don't pay any attention to the otherwise excellent Allmusic guide either). Give it a try. There is a lot to love here.
0446677450|1.0|This poorly written book is more about personal improvement than investing, but the exhortations to save more and spend less are common sense. The inconsistencies in the few examples and the lack of specifics makes one wonder about the veracity of many of the claims. The two dads story itself is hard to believe.     I find myself wondering if the authors make all their money by selling books to gullible people like myself. I do not recommend this book.
B00005RIKI|5.0|Okay, so this isn't Dylan or the Beatles, but it sure is fun.  Lynyrd Skynyrd's debut album isn't just \\"the one with 'Free Bird' on it\\", it's much more than that, one of the original group's best efforts, and quite possibly the best one of the lot. It mixes heartfelt ballads, country, swaggering riff-rockers, and the delightfully silly down-home boogie-rock of \\"Gimme Three Steps\\" and \\"I Ain't The One\\".    I do prefer the slightly tougher (and string-less) live rendition of \\"Tuesday's Gone\\" from the \\"One More From The Road\\" album, but this one is no throwayay either. And you can't help but love the aforementioned \\"Gimme Three Steps\\" and \\"I Ain't The One\\", a wonderful blend of self-deprecating lyrics and gritty guitar riffs.  The stately slow rock number \\"Simple Man\\" is not one of Skynyrd's best-known songs, but it's certainly one of their best, and it showcases what a talented vocalist the late Ronnie van Zant really was. And the rollicking country-rock bounce of \\"Things Goin' On\\" makes you want to jerk your shoulders up and down while pushing out your lower lip. (Seriously.)    Skynyrd also try their hand at an acoustic country blues pastiche, \\"Mississippi Kid\\", and with plenty of succes at that.   \\"Poison Whiskey\\" is probably the most sincere hard rocker on the album, a rough but juicy slice of prime Southern rock. Oh, and then there's a looong number called \\"Free Bird\\" tacked on to the end of the original album.    ...This expanded 2001 edition features five excellent bonus tracks, demo versions of \\"Tuesday's Gone\\" (a tougher version with no strings, which I consider a plus), \\"Gimme Three Steps\\", \\"Free Bird\\", and the non-album tracks \\"Mr Banker\\" and \\"Down South Jukin'\\". Three of them are previously unreleased; the low-key \\"Mr Banker\\" and the melodic rock n' roll of \\"Down South Jukin'\\" have seen the light of day earlier, but they are certainly great to have if you don't own them already.     Great bonus tracks on a great, great album, one of the classics of Southern rock. 70s rock n' roll. Or just American rock n' roll in general. Don't let the(partly tongue-in-cheek) redneck image of Lynyrd Skynyrd scare you off; this is really good stuff. Great melodies, big hooks and big riffs, a tight band and some really excellent musicianship. Four and three-quarter stars!
B000002J1S|5.0|I believe this album to be Genesis at their peak.  It sounds nothing like anything they had produced before or after.  It was Pete's swan song.  I still listen to it and sometimes find it hard to believe that this was the same band that put out \\"Selling England...\\", etc.  It's very different and it stands alone.  For a lot of people, this seems to be the last Genesis album they pick up.  The story IS very strange but I think it still holds up.  Why a concert of it wasn't filmed, in it's entirety is a damn shame!  They performed it 102 times - the WHOLE thing from \\"The Lamb\\" to \\"It\\".
B0007OY2P8|1.0|A horrible movie of this great Austen novel. Bad performances, awful music and clich&eacute; acting. Don't buy it.
B0001CNRBG|5.0|We went to Mendocino for our honeymoon and everyone told us to watch this movie. While a movie about cheating on your spouse doesn't seem like a great idea and there really wasn't that much of the town shown in the movie it was still a really good movie.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|Bob Dylan-Modern Times *****<br /><br />Despite what the title of the album may sugest, Modern Times is not Bob Dylan taking a stab at the new trends in music, and a more modern sound. Could you imagine Bob Dylan going electronica, no I don't mean like when he plugged in his guitar for Bringing It All Back Home, like what if Dylan tried to record his version of Radioheads Kid A. Wouldn't that be something? Modern Times is really the equivalent of the master Ray Charles' Modern Sounds In Country... It is basically a twist (slightly) on the blues with a small country twang. Which is really when you think about it nothing new for Dylan because he had been doing variations of this for years.<br /><br />Songs like the albums lead single, the rumbling 'Thunder On The Mountain' are token Dylan. 'Spirit On The Water' recalls some of his best spiritual recordings, like that of Slow Train Coming for example. 'The Levee's Gonna Break' could bring a tear to the eye of the burrliest of man, while 'Nettie Moore' is Dylans best song since the early 1970's, and maybe of his entire career.<br /><br />Modern Times is no joke. This album is (to quote a favotire cliche) all killer and no filler. In the trilogy that is Dylans last three albums of this, \\"Love And Theft,\\" and the brilliant Time Out Of Mind. Man it's a great album!
0143038583|5.0|The book came on time and in great condition. I am still reading it now (on meal three) and finding out a lot of things that I did not know and other things that I have just turned a blind eye to. If you want to really get your intelligence started in finding out what you are eating and how it has changed from the good ole days...start here.
B0013D8LOU|5.0|This movie though it might look cheesy or since its a musical, doesn't mean its bad.  Johnny Depp and Alan Rickman do an awesome job for never singing before.  Its an amazing movie and I went out and bought the soundtrack the day after seeing it in theatres.  There aren't any words to describe its beauty.  Don't knock not it cuz its a musical, you might find you'll enjoy it.  Its morbidly hilarious.
B00005JMJG|5.0|When I first heard this was a story of someone having their memory erased of someone they once loved, I thought...how are they going to pull this off! Well they did. Everyone from Charlie Kaufman to Michael Gondry, Jim Carrey actually playing someone real with depth for a change to Kate Winslet's brillant quirky multi hair color changing ex (or maybe not) girlfriend. Even the supporting cast...Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, Tom Wilkinson and Elijan Wood. All were great. Mostly due to fine writing & direction.    There were at least three messages I got from this mind twisting masterpiece.    First...  You can't erase things from your life. You have to learn to sift out the good & bad & even learn from mistakes.     Second....  Two people that were attracted to one another might become attracted once again (Ex. Not only the obvious leads, but even Kirsten Dunst was falling in love with the Doctor a second time around).    Third.....  Elijah Wood's idea of charming Clementine by using her previous boyfriend's gifts wasn't working.    Then, towards the end when Jim & Kate realize what's happening & he says \\"Can we try again?\\" & she says \\"Yeah well at first it'll be great & then in a while we'll be fighting again\\"    This is so true!    People forget that opposites attract & often the differences that we once were charmed by can drive us crazy later.    If people only sat back & thought through this common irritation, maybe there would be less divorce or break ups.      What a great movie with imagination!
B0006GAOBI|4.0|This is one of those /headtilt movies.  I think the concept of it was cool, acting was amazing, but the concept did throw me for a loopty loop.  I just couldn't put it all together, I think if I watch it again then maybe I'll understand a bit better.  But even if you don't get the deep down meaning behind it all, its still very well acted and a mindpuzzle.(didn't want to add profanity there ^.^)  So, I say watch it no matter what you hear, cuz there are a lot of different opinions on it.  Jake does a marvolous job and he deserves kudos.
B000YRY8BG|5.0|This mini-series is a taut thriller that I recommend to anyone. It's no surprise that an American version is in the works. It is well written, the charcters are real, the choice of actors is perfect, and none of the dialogue is gratuitous. Very compelling TV.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Perhaps I'm predisposed to agree with Gore's message; like him, I studied biology at UCSD long ago, and heard similar explanations about alarming long-term statistical implications regarding the atmosphere and oceans.  Those who claim that this is \\"junk science\\" or \\"liberal propaganda\\" are mistaken; it is scholarly and measured in its tone and content.  Given the truth of its implications, what do we do about it?  The saddest effect of this film is that many businesses have sprung up, selling \\"green\\" products.  It's the entire culture of insatiable consumerism, combined with growing industrialization and overpopulation, which has brought us to this point.  Humanity's manner of living is ultimately unsustainable in the long term.  So how do we adapt? It is so much easier to simply claim that nothing has been proved, or that \\"feel good\\" measures like carbon credits actually bring relief.  It will take much more than that; and we are running out of time...
B0013BNY2Q|5.0|I'm actually amazed with this release.  No over-thought tracks, just one song after another where the band sounds like they are having fun again.  I'd actually like to see them perform this material live, the album has a live \\"feel\\" to it.    Of note.....if you have a turntable BUY THE LP RECORD VERSION OF ACCELERATE!!!  Several reviewers have had issues with the CD quality, and it's interesting to hear this on a turntable with vinyl.  When I got it, it comes with 2 LP albums, both are 180-gram vinyl, and they spin at 45 RPM.  Audio wise, the albums are stunning when listened to in vinyl.  Now when you buy the LP record, you also get a copy of the CD with it.  Interesting to listen to them both on the same stereo--the CD is atrocious when compared to the vinyl.  The mastering on the CD just doesn't cut it.    But the album rocks.  Highly recommended.
B000003S5H|5.0|This band is simply great. It's got lot of interesting sounds that will take you on to different feelings as you listen to them. I could listen to the track \\"All I Need\\" all day long. The whole CD is soothing in a happy kind of way, kinda makes you feel \\"well, life is pretty darn good after all\\"
B000001FQQ|5.0|This is what great KISS music sounds like. I purchased this album on cassett tape in 1989 when it first came out. My fiance recently heard the song Forever, track #7, and wanted to use it for our wedding dance. I knew exactly which album it was on and I wanted to get it on CD. So, here I am.     This is also the last entire album with Eric Carr on the drums and lead vocals on the song Little Caesar, track #14.     Fun music! Brings back lot's of memories.
B0013BNY2Q|5.0|Love it. I think this album can be held up to any of their classics. It's the best album since 'Out Of Time'. Michael is pissed off thank god. It's about time someone was. Anyway I just want to say I think 'I'm gonna DJ' is one of the best songs they have ever written. Those who don't like it can go jump in a lake. This is good rockin, thoughful R.E.M. folks nothing more nothing less.
B00020HEG6|5.0|This is a great Soundtrack! I think it's the most interesting from the whole Harry Potter series up to now.    The Great John Williams has done a really good work.    Starting from the main Hedwige's Theme, the listener can live an hour of full amazing entertainment. From Middle Age stiled music, to modern clustered chilling choir harmonies, to exciting rythms and romance... This is CD, trust me, is the real Magic! ;-)
B000MGUZM0|3.0|Funeral sounds like a dance party compared to Neon Bible.  All the elements that made Arcade Fire such a blast of fresh air are still firmly in place.  What other group does the interplay between vocals and everything-into-the-mix instrumentation nearly as well? It's hard for me to think of one.  But I've been hearing white guys sing about how awful things are and the coming apocalypse for pretty much four decades now and it is getting very old.  Lyrics like \\"Mirror, mirror on the wall/Show me where the bombs will fall\\" (Black Mirror); \\"A vial of hope, a vial of pain\\" (Neon Bible), \\"Every spark of friendship and love/will die without a home\\" (Intervention) and others like them (and almost every song on Neon Bible offers a new example) have been stale for decades.  Trying to be clever by dressing them in allusions to John Kennedy O'Toole does nothing to freshen them.  It just shows off, as the one guy who made and makes such sentiments fresh once said, \\"useless and pointless knowledge.\\"
B000SZQNLC|5.0|I was surprised at how fast it came, and when I got it, it was in better condition then had been posted. The vinyl itself was in perfect condition. The sleeve was also in very good condition. The description had said that one of the corners had been bumped, but it was barely noticable. It's awesome.
0143143492|4.0|I have the CD version. I have found this to be very interesting and thought provoking. At times his depth is difficult to follow but then again after rewinding and relistening I \\"get it\\". I found it enlightening andrewinding or replaying a good thing.
B00011F5DK|5.0|My husband and I love this game.  It is lots more fun than you might think just by looking at it.  We each use two colors.  The designer of this game put a lot of thought into the shape and allocation of the pieces.  It is really a great product.
1401216676|2.0|I just received my copy of this book from Amazon and I feel like I'm seeing Greedo shooting Han first all over again.<br />I was thrilled about seeing this story re-colored but I wasn't ready for such a radical, I repeat RADICAL color change.<br /><br />You could say what you want about the [original colorist] John Higgins work Who also did the color chores for [[ASIN:0930289234 Watchmen]] but you can not deny it was way better than Mr. Bolland's, who is one of my all-time favorite artist but also one of the worst colorist ever from now on.<br /><br />I wish I could rate it lower but it takes more than crappy coloring to ruin such a great masterpiece as this is. I think that if you have never seen the original edition since 1988 as I did this will not matter so much. I just loved it the way it was.<br /><br />Brian Bolland (and George Lucas too for that matter) should know by now that works of art are just like daughters. Once they are over 18 they have a life of their own and you could force your way on them on account of being the \\"father\\" and all...but it will be so wrong.<br />I hate it when I have to say `Just because you CAN do something doesn't mean you SHOULD' because it always involves something that is -or at least was- very dear to me.
B000NIVJHM|5.0|If you collect DVDs you probably already know that the picture/audio quality of older films that are transferred to DVD is hit or miss.  The 20th Anniversay edition of \\"Diry Dancing\\" is definitely a hit. The picture and sound quality are simply outstanding! On my 46-inch high definition TV with my Toshiba 1080p HD DVD--the picture and sound are stunning! The picture is crystal clear and sharp and the colors are rich and vibrant. This movie did not look this good in theaters in 1987, when it was first released. The picture has been enhanced for large, wide screen TVs--so there are no annoying black zones (bars) on the top or the sides of the screen. It fills the whole screen. I still cannot believe that this is a regular DVD, not a high definition edition. It looks and sounds as good as my HD DVDs.
B0014Z4OQG|2.0|...maybe we'd be well over the need for jerky amaturish videos passing themselves off as a movie. I spent the entire time wishing it'd switch over to THE WORK OF AN ACTUAL MOVIE STUDIO instead of high school kids on Spring Break.<br /><br />I gave it two stars: One for the really good seldom seen monster (very original) and the other for the video camera battery from hell. There are cars that don't have a battery that lasts that long under constant use. If only they'd shown the brand so we could all buy one!<br /><br />The video begins with Rob and Beth having a romantic fling and switches to a boring party that lasts at least 5 or 6 hours, showing people we don't want to know, discussing relationships we don't care about, until AT LAST we get to the apparent point of it all -- the invasion. It would have been wonderful if then we could have switched to something we could watch without getting a headache, but no. We stick with the freakin' amature video (which is explained as being viewed by the government in an effort to figure out what happened in New York).  So. What happened in New York?  Well, \\"something nasty\\" showed up, wreaked the city, spawned off a lot of little vicious buggers, the humans are losing, the lovers are running.........<br /><br />And then it stops. We never find out what the monster is or where it came from. We don't know who wins, if anyone. IT JUST FREAKIN' STOPS.<br /><br />Here's a thought for the makers of this loser vid: Sell the monster to a real studio and turn 'em lose. Give them the battery to your video camera while you're at it since you obviously have no use for it.<br /><br />Pass this one by.
0679642609|1.0|Here is what Gregory Hays, this translator, wrote:  1. MY GRANDFATHER VERSUS. Character and self-control.  This is choppy.  These are sentence fragments.  Here is how Maxwell Staniforth translated the same passage in the [[ASIN:0141018828 Meditations]]:  1. Courtesy and serenity of temper I first learnt to know from my grandfather Versus.    Heres another verse from Hays:  2. MY FATHER (FROM MY OWN MEMORIES AND HIS REPUTATION). Integrity and manliness.  From Staniforth:  2. Manliness without ostentation I learnt from what I have heard and remember of my father.    Heaven forbid you let a young person read the sentence fragments from Hays.

B000E1MTY0|4.0|I erroneously thought that this version was already in Blu-ray but that is not the case since I've yet to see it at either of the 2 leading stores, Circuit City or Best Buy(you have to pre-order at Amazon).  Anyway I have it it in HD and it's simply reference quality Hi-Def. Enough has been said about the excellence that Christopher Nolan (Memento, Insomnia) brought to this film and of course the fine cast (Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Rutger Hauer, Gary Oldman, etc).  The only weak member of the cast would be Katie Holmes (Sorry, Tom!!), she is just too wan and detached for us to root for her as Bruce's love interest but thankfully Maggie Glyenhaal will be better in the sequel!! This disc along with \\"King Kong\\" and the recent final cut of \\"Blade Runner\\" will definitely show off the benefits of HD. Plus you could probably get this much cheaper than the Blu-ray edition when it comes out perhaps as low as $10 or $12 used and $14.95 new!!  Am looking forward to the follow-up, \\"The Dark Knight\\", in the summer or fall, I suppose.
1591841984|5.0|This book is an absolute pleasure to read. I especially loved Leander Kahney's approach to Steve Job's character, as well as reading some more about the behind-the-scenes stuff, particularly when it involves other members of the Mac/NeXT team.

B0002XMF5S|3.0|For years, I outright dismissed this album after hearing a few cuts mainly just because I didn't like Tony Iommi continuing to use the name Black Sabbath after Geezer Butler and Bill Ward left. Tony Iommi and other studio musicians is NOT Black Sabbath. A few weeks ago, however, I bought this on cassette for a buck or two and listened to it again and decided that it's really not that bad. Sure, it's not as memorable as any of the Black Sabbath albums before it, and as a collection of songs, it was easily the weakest album Iommi did up to that point.<br /><br />BUT...it's nowhere near as silly as Born Again (even though Born Again had much better songs), and the mix is certainly an improvement over Born Again. Glenn Hughes singing is much easier to take than it was with Deep Purple. I could tolerate his singing much more than I could Tony Martin's. And, while much of the songs here function more as background music, it is certainly not an embarassment to the Black Sabbath name. And it sounds like a masterpiece when compared to some of the Tony Iommi and Martin albums, like Headless Cross (where they got too much into the scary, devil image!) and Tyr...and Dehumanizer and Cross Purposes, for that anti-matter!<br /><br />Seventh Star is still a very heavy album, though there are more synthesizers than usual, maybe due to the fact that keyboardist Geoff Nichols (who is credited for writing some lyrics and who claims he helped write some of the music, as well) was now listed as a full time band member. The opening song, 'In For The Kill' is a fast, heavy number done in 7/4 time (!) and features some outstanding drumming from Eric Singer. ' No Stranger To Love ' is a power ballad, similar in title, at least, to Whitesnake's 'Love Aint No Stranger'. The video, featuring Tony Iommi sulking around, was kind of lame, but the song itself is one of the album's highlights. But who ever thought a power ballad would be the highlight of an album bearing the Black Sabbath name? 'Turn To Stone' is another fast song, with a likable guitar riff. 'Sphinx (The Guardian)' is a short keyboard and synthesizer instrumental, along the lines of E5150 and Stonehenge (though not as good) .The title track is like 'Kashmir, Part 3', due to it's drum beat and Egyptian or middle eastern like riff. It even has strings on it! Still, I like the guitar riff, though Glenn's vocals don't add much to the song.<br /><br />The second half isn't as strong as the first half, though Iommi gets plenty of room to solo on 'Heart Like A Wheel'. His guitar solos on here sometimes bring to my mind his playing on Technical Ecstacy. I do like the last song, the repetitive and dirge like 'In Memory', which...like The Mob Rules' 'Over and Over', ends the album on a sad note and is dedicated to Iommi's father.<br /><br />So, it's not Black Sabbath. But it certainly is Iommi and is worth listening to. Don't be silly like I was and let the name Black Sabbath scare you off from listening to it. Just don't go into it with high expectations.s another fast song, with a likable guitar riff.

Surprisingly, he managed to write and direct a respectable, worthwhile film.  The characters are deep, interesting, and have lots of great thought-provoking dialogue.  The story is well-told; if made by anybody else, I think it could have come across as shallow, contrived, or hoaky.  Instead, this film surpasses most other thrillers (like \\"Along Came a Spider\\") by generating strong emotions and churning out some interesting questions about the story and characters.<br /><br />The DVD has good quality image and sound, and contains a number of featurettes and deleted scenes.

0061122416|5.0|This book was absolutely delightful.  It's a fast, easy read that still has substance. It left me feeling uplifted, with its simple message told elegantly and well.  Coelho seems to have a talent for squeezing big ideas into a simple story, a boy searching for treasure.  The mystical elements are handled deftly, and the reader never trips over complex or cumbersome mythology, but instead glides happily along to the end with the hero.  The alchemist of the title could be the character of the same name or it could be the boy, but I think it is the author, with his lovely, eloquent prose that speaks volumes.

B00005JPTK|4.0|I loved this movie, even though I am not a big Will Smith fan, I think he plays the brooding hero very well.  I'm a true sci fi nut and love anything hinting at supernatural, so this movie was right up my alley.  I purchased the expensive version with the alternate ending and found it to be lack luster in its finish.  The original version is definately better.  I enjoyed it and have seen it at least four times now and enjoy it more each time, its very entertaining which is what true sci fi is all about.
B000XGDO04|5.0|Adele's voice is fantastic and emotive. She blends British acoustic with blues and soul like Lauryn Hill(unplugged) meets Tracy Thorn and Etta James.    This is the only album I have listened to for the past month. My favorites are (soulful) Melt My Heart to Stone, (folk/country) Crazy for You, (blues vocal) First Love and (motown-ish) Right as Rain.    Her style is NOT the Amy Winehouse raspy attitude type of voice. Adele's niche is with her guitar and her voice.    I can't get enough.

0385338724|4.0|In Remember Me? Alex Smart finds herself in the hospital with a concussion and begins trying to piece together how she got there. All she can remember from the night before is that she had been out drinking with the girls on a rainy night and she slipped and fell on the wet pavement. But when she goes to look in the mirror, she sees that she's somehow lost a good amount of weight and her teeth are amazingly straight and shiny. And why does she have a Louis Vuitton bag next to her nightstand? She can't afford that!<br /><br />When people begin to visit her, she doesn't recognize them and they look older than she expects. Finally someone tells her that it's 2007 not 2004. The slip and fall incident happened three years ago. But she doesn't remember the last three years, which includes her meeting her now-husband. The tale that ensues is hilarious as always and not nearly as cliche as I had previously thought.<br /><br />Sophie Kinsella has a way of telling stories that makes me fall in love with her characters and manages to put me in their shoes (even though I know I'll never be able to afford the lifestyle of many of her characters). However, having read all of Kinsella's books, I'm beginning to see a pattern. She spends the first 2/3 of the book making us fall in love with the main character and all of her witty mishaps. We also watch as they nearly destroy their lives, then in the last few chapters the main character thinks of something brilliant that saves her crumbling career, or that of her husband or friends. As I was reading this book I realized it had become formulaic and it made me sad because I do so love Sophie Kinsella. I still recommend this book because it's a fun and easy read, but if you've read all of Kinsella's other work be aware that you'll be reading it saying to yourself, \\"OK, now what's she going to think of to save everyone's job? Because I know that's coming next.\\"<br /><br />If you've never read Kinsella, I highly suggest Can you keep a secret? and Confessions of a shopaholic.a shopaholic.
0618918248|5.0|I have enjoyed this book, as well as Dawkin's similar work, very much. I find him enlightened and a great communicator of valuable life-affirming ideas. He longs for people to think for themsleves and as such, he argues succsessfully, make the world a more harmonious and tolerant place.    On a personal level i'd like to say that after digesting Mr Dawkin's comments, i generally feel inspired to adpot a more outwards and vocal approach to my own entirely atheistic views. Not to necessarily enforce my views on people face to face (this kind of thing is annoying when unsolicited), but to do more in the way of joining organizations and becoming invloved in internet communities and so forth actively promoting scientific facts and the challenging of ignorance.     The problem, however, is that i love my wife.    She is a serious-mided Catholic who was brought up in an almost exclusively Catholic community in Poland - a predominantly Catholic country.     Now, i have always been an atheist and if pushed will maintain with, i think, solid reasoning that religion is merely a human concept (not a divine one) that does us more harm than good and is at best quaint in it's more minor traditions and at worst the epitome of stupidity and danger.     What to do?    I love my wife dearly and i say this in all honesty, she is a very honest and lovely person. She is kind, considerate and liked by everyone she meets. As much as i disagree with religious convictions, she says the church for her is very important and for me... that really is that. I respect her for her loving personality and as decent a person. We naturally have some differences of opinion, for instance, will our children be brought up Catholic? This is not a prospect i look forward to, but relationships (human relationships) are all about compromise and respect. And so, i think constructively how our children may be very fortunate in having two parents who dissagree on major issues in life, but still get on very well and love each other.     This has been a lesson to me.    I thank Richard Dawkins immensely for his valuable work and i do think it's important to redress certain problems of ignorance and coercion in our societies, BUT... i implore everyone to see the human being there first, before the religion of the person.    I have to dissagree with Mr Dawkins on just one point. When he says \\"it is time to stop being so damn respectful\\", i contest that it is NOT time to stop being respectful, but it's time to promote the overwhelming benefits of scientific enquiry whilst being very careful that we don't forget that there are many decent people in this world who happen to believe in God and also in love.
B000K4WLXA|1.0|If you want a beautifully animated movie with no sensical plot whatsoever, then this is for you. Don't get me wrong: I'm a huge Final Fantasy fan, and have been awaiting this with bated breath. However, it was a sorry disappointment. The plot was awful. I don't want to go into detail for fear of ruining it for those who haven't seen it, but they rarely discussed the plot with any detail and barely brushed the surface of it, which caused a lot of confusion for me and the others who watched it with me. By the end of the movie, I still didn't quite understand what had happened.    All in all, I don't think it was very well thought out. It just seemed like an excuse for cheesy battle scenes and to grab a bit of cash from Final Fantasy VII fans. If you're still interested, I suggest renting it first, because I feel like I totally wasted my money.

B0010YSD7M|3.0|For what it was this movie was good.  A few questions are answered and the Ori are dealt with permanently but, and its a big but, it just wasn't very satisfying.  I kept getting the feeling that this was just a slightly stretched out epsiode, maybe what should have been the final episode of the series instead of the one where they are stuck on the ship.  If it had been the end of the series I might have raved about it, as it is though it just didn't have the punch that I wanted.  There wasn't enough drama and the action seemed very forced.  The action mostly revolved around a completely out of left field plot point that just left me scratching my head.  Its like they tried to make up more action so that all of the characters could have screen time, it was completely unnecessary and other more interesting action could have been thought up.  I apologise for being purposefully obtuse but I don't want to give away anything for people who haven't seen the movie yet.      The Ori were never very interesting bad guys to me, the whole destroy the heretics thing just left me yawning, because of that the last two seasons of Stargate SG1 were not as fullfilling as they could have been for me personally.  This movie was a last chance for the Ori to be an interesting baddie, and in that the movie failed.  At least this isn't truely the end.  Continuum sounds much more interesting, but then again I always though Baal was a very good bad guy.  The Ark of Truth was a good wrap up to the Ori saga but lets get some down and dirty SG1 action to send off the series properly.
B000Y179KO|5.0|I am an old Dane of 62. So please excuse my English. I just want to tell you, that I find this double-CD one of the best the last many years. I listen to it every day and can't find a really bad song. My favourites are How Long and I Don't Want To Hear Any More.
B000E6ESL2|1.0|I saw this movie a while back, actually, just when it hit the theater, so I'll comment on MY recollection of that event (even though I swore to myself that I'd erase those memories). For me, I think it started from a good, valid premise of a spiritual theme and overlapped by an out-of-body experience, mixed with a near-death-experience and the eternal question of \\"what happens after life?\\" (or death, as you wish to ask).    So it delivers you to the no-space, no-time realm, which we all deeply know  it exists, but which our conscience refuses to embrace as the REAL reality, and insists -often by habit- to \\"live\\" or get immersed in the illusion of this three dimensional plane and accept it as reality.    So... from the starting premise, for the entire length of the movie it never takes you anywhere else, it never expands to the endless possibilities it could have gone, and since it couldn't make its point clear with all the elements film has to offer, it has to blurt out the whole meaning of the movie in the one-liner that never got imprinted in any other part of the movie. Really sad to see that much talent wasted, and the time of all the spectators. The one liner could have much more easily been delivered to a whole lot more people, in the way we all love (NOT!), a chain letter with an attached powerpoint presentation, and saved us all a lot of time if we add it up.
0525950079|5.0|This story was over too soon.  That's the main problem that I have had with Pillars & World.  I enjoyed them so much, that I could read about these people & times forever.  I enjoyed Pillars of the Earth more than World without End, but World was just as captivating.  I felt that some of the characters were not as charming as their predecssors.  Priors Godwyn & Anthony were such polar opposites from Prior Phillip, you almost want to go back in time to bring him back.  Your heart breaks when the recent priors battle so fiercely with the town & prioresses.  As good as Phillip was & as self centered, he still put the monestary's needs before his own ego.  How wonderful that the next installation would be so different!      If you are thinking this will be a similar tale to Pillar of the Earth, you'll be disappointed.  While the area is the same, the characters & qualities are compeltely different.  This makes it that much more engrossing!
B0014Z4OQG|3.0|I remeber seeing previews of this movie at the theater. I am really glad I waited for the DVD instead of paying the price of a ticket. I had great hopes, but the hand-held documentery style filming was awful. The camera was all over the place and in fact made me quite dizzy at times. The documentary angle is way over done. The acting is horrible with a bunch of yuppies wandering through Manhattan amid its total destruction by an unidentified monster. A worn out plot, relatively unknown actors and ludicrous situations make it difficult to watch with enjoyment. I gave it three stars just for the brief but very good special effects.
B0013D8LOK|5.0|\\"Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street,\\" (2007) is the latest collaboration of that imaginative young director Tim Burton, and one of his favorite stars, the versatile Johnny Depp.  It costars the beauteous Helena Bonham Carter, currently the director's main squeeze.  It won two Golden Globes, one for Depp as Best Actor, one as Best Picture, Musical or Comedy.  It also won two Oscars, to Dante Ferretti for art direction, another to Francesca Lo Schiavo, for set decoration. It is based on the 1979 Broadway musical of the same name, which was written by Hugh Wheeler, with music by the celebrated Stephen Sondheim, and was directed by Hal Prince.  That entertainment starred Len Cariou as Todd, and Angela Lansbury, as Mrs. Lovett.  I clearly remember having seen it, and loved it, but I must say, although theater has the advantage of intimacy, what Prince could do on that stage can't hold a candle to what Burton achieves in the filmed version.  Of course, many viewers, and reviewers, have complained about the buckets of blood in which Burton has bathed the story, but he has also filmed it with great sweep and visual flair; he has created a believable 19th century London, England, in which the action takes place; and he has gotten superb performances from his actors.<br /><br />Depp plays Sweeney Todd, who once was naïve; he was the simple barber Benjamin Barker, had a beautiful wife and a lovely infant daughter, and was unlucky enough that they should catch the eye of the unscrupulous Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman, and is there a rule that 1/3 of movies made in England must star him, or is he just that valuable an actor?)  Turpin has the barber transported to Australia, a place from which convicts are forbidden to return, but return Barker does, as Todd, determined to find his wife and child, and/or to have his revenge. Bonham Carter plays his former/future landlady, Mrs. Lovett, whose shop sells the worst meat pies in London. Barber and landlady will get caught up in a mad, murderous scheme that will ultimately prove disastrous for them.<br /><br />Timothy Spall turns in a strong performance as the oily, corrupt Beadle Bamford, Turpin's henchman.  Sacha Baron Cohen (\\"Borat\\") does very well as Davey Collins, AKA Adolfo Pirelli, rival barber.  Jamie Campbell Bower plays Todd's young shipmate Anthony Hope.  And 15-year old Edward Sanders gives a remarkable performance as the boy Toby, Pirelli's helper.<br /><br />Toby and Mrs. Lovett duet on \\"Nothing's Going to Harm You, Not While I'm Around,\\" and produce a song of unearthly beauty.  Todd and the judge also duet, on \\"Pretty Women,\\" a taste in the first act and the full number in the third, and it's just gorgeous.  There may be too much recitative for some viewers, but the score has Sondheim's typical wit and edginess, and is never less than enjoyable.  And who knew all these actors could sing so well?<br /><br />Burton's filmed tragedy has great intensity and impact; surely, to some degree, because Depp and Bonham Carter are both such beautiful, magnetic, sensual performers.  Cariou is an excellent stage actor/singer, and was about Depp's current age when he created the part of Todd; however, let's just say he is no Johnny Depp.  When Angela Lansbury created Mrs. Lovett, she was more than a decade older than Bonham Carter is now, and Lansbury has always photographed older.  She's a highly competent actress/singer, perhaps best known today for her long television run as Jessica Fletcher, in\\"Murder, She Wrote.\\"  And she began her film career, in 1944 and-5, with two Oscar-nominated turns as saucy, sexy servant girls in \\"Gaslight,\\" and \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray.\\" But she'd been playing mothers for decades.<br /><br />Both play and movie are based on the 19th century legend of Sweeney Todd, with which parents scared their disobedient children.  Some records appear to show that he really existed, but their authenticity is disputed.  Fleet Street is an old and famous street.  It first appears on maps in the 14th century, connecting the City of London with the City of Westminster, running alongside the river Fleet.  The river became heavily contaminated with sewage, girdled in and bridged by wooden structures, so contaminated it actually exploded(as, more recently, did an Ohio river), and burnt its wooden surroundings.  A character in play and movie keeps complaining about the terrible smell from Mrs. Lovett's Fleet Street chimneys at night, but I rather suspect the street smelled day and night in the 19th century. Even more so, as we are given several glimpses of the sewer beneath the street and the water can only be running in the old river bed.<br /><br />Nevertheless, printers and publishers located on the street from the 15th Century; more recently, for more than a century, England's most famous newspapers were headquartered there, and \\"Fleet Street\\" still serves as a synonym for the English newspaper industry, and the kind of hectic, celebrity-mad journalism it practices.  The last major paper left Fleet Street in the 1980's; Reuters left in 2005.  The street's much quieter these days, mainly the site of numerous respectable law offices.  You'd never know it once was called home, at least in legend, by Sweeney Todd, the demon barber.

Anyway, check this one out .It will amaze!!!!<br />A solid 4.7 for strong rock record!!!!!
B00005J9M3|2.0|The lead track, \\"Being Boring,\\" has engendered affection over the years, but it is unmistakably ironic that a song with that title leads off an album of mostly plodding, sleepy, electro-elevator music.  Most of the songs are boring.  You'd have to be a hardcore PSB fan to find this a good album.  For everyone else, this is the single for \\"Being Boring\\" and \\"How Can You,\\" and all the rest are B-sides.
B0009SQMIW|2.0|If you like Kansas enough to want a collection of their radio ready singles, then you should invest in the 7 studio records this collection is drawn from. There's more than enough to engage even a casual fan of Kansas. The reason for buying all the CD's represented here is not simply that they are really good, but it is also because this collection is technically botched. It was released on vinyl in 1982 and contained one new song,\\"Perfect Lover\\", which had no particular appeal to it. For some strange reason, the band's engineer, Dave Moire, and two of it's members decided to re-mix these songs and encase some of them in plate reverb, so that Steve Walsh sounds like he is singing in an empty oil drum. One would think that these songs, all being hits, would sell themselves. But not so. To compound the error, this disc was an example of what happens when you simply transfer old analog masters to digital. It emerged as the first Kansas CD release of the digital age, with all it's faults uncorrected.     In 1998, this collection with a replicated and color corrected cover was released for CD. \\"Perfect Lover\\" was gone, but the disc had some new \\"hits\\" added to take advantage of the longer CD format. Fortunately,  the songs had been properly mastered and restored to their original mixes.    So, when you shop for CD's you may see almost identical covers, with similar, but different track listings. The one with \\"Perfect Lover\\" is the one you don't want. I have them both and the difference is astonishing. Don't make the mistake of buying THIS version.
B000TUXL2A|2.0|This is a huge anticlimax after All The Roadrunning. Undistinguished and dull songs for the most part. But what is unforgivable is that Knopfler has literally, passage-by-passage, copied from the Italian songwriter and performer, Paolo Conti. Did Knopfler really believe that noone would notice?
B001437DMA|5.0|This guy is above and beyond my favorite artist.  Every album has yet to disappoint.  Only one song I don't particularly like on this release:  Professor Satchafunkilus.

B000JLQSWE|3.0|Vulture Culture marked a change in direction for the Alan Parsons Project. No longer would the album open with an instrumental track. In fact, this album has only one instrumental, \\"Hawkeye\\", which is not one of their best. It's a shame because one of the Project's greatest strengths were instrumentals. Vulture Culture peaked at #46 on the album chart. There were two singles from the album that charted: \\"Days Are Numbers (The Traveler)\\" went to #71 & \\"Let's Talk About Me\\" which went to #56.<br /><br />Those of who are musicians and/or those who have ventured into the music business are there because we love music, it's a passion. That's the main reason, making money is just a bonus. Those of us that write music, we love to create something that is our own. Even those that aren't songwriters, those who cover songs, love to arrange a song & put our own twist to it in order to make it 'our own'. Unfortunately, music is a business, it's there to make money. When a profit isn't being realized then the industry cuts its losses. Another unfortunate aspect of the business is , through the years, everyone wants to sell records. There are very few who can do exactly the kind of music they wish to & still stay in the recording business. I say all this wondering if the Project made this decision on their own or was it something they were forced to do. This album made a definite shift from prog/pop into mostly pop & dance/pop.<br /><br />The most unusual aspect of Vulture Culture is it averageness; there isn't a bad song nor a good song. It's a very consistent album, unfortunately, it's consistently average. Five bonus tracks have been added to the album. Only \\"The Naked Vulture\\" & \\"No Answers Only Questions (The First Attempt)\\" stand out, in fact, they're almost the best things on here, including the tracks on the original release. \\"Days Are Numbers (The Traveler)\\" & \\"No Answers Only Questions\\" are the only tracks that standout from the others. I refrain from using the word mediocre, anyone who spends the time to create music, even this type, shouldn't have that charged to them. I have way too much respect for Parsons & Woolfson to call any of their efforts mediocre; it's simply not a creative highpoint.o spends the time to create music, even this type, shouldn't have that charged to them.

157912626X|5.0|What \\"improvements\\" have been made for the Black Dog & Leventhal edition?  There are already major differences in punctuation, word choices, and scene breaks between the original Collins and Dodd Mead editions of this novel. There are further differences between the Dodd Mead editions republished by Random House/Avenel and the Dodd Mead editions republished by Simon & Shuster/Pocket.  There are further additions still in the Signet, Bantam, and Berkley editions.  For every publishing house putting out her works, there seem to be a new batch of editors altering Agatha Christie's words and the sound of her voice.  What's the matter with these publishers? Whose voice do they think we want to hear when we sit down to a novel by Agatha Christie? And what will she sound like twenty years from now? It's frightening that her estate has failed to see the importance of guarding her words as she wrote them.  Please tell me I'm not the only one here who senses that a crime has been committed.
0670018651|5.0|I love this book unequivocally.  Turin and Sanchez are a fantastic writing team and comparisons with Nabokov and other masters of verbal pyrotechnics are not off the mark.  This book is a perfect antidote to the anodyne 21st century refusal to discern between grades of excellence.<br /><br />Let me start with an example not related to perfume:  have you ever met produces  \\"just as good\\" music as that of Beethoven?  Have you ever tried to argue the case that Shakespeare is not better than any teenaged poetaster?  Yes, we are all equally of one genius! Not!<br /><br /> Turin and Sanchez combine their penetrating noses with pungent prose and almost supernaturally divine lyricism to examine the world of perfume.  If you read this book with some care (and I've spent many hours on it already) it can be an education for your own nose.  Get your perfume collection and try two or three a day.  If you don't have a perfume collection, go to the department store and try two or three.  If you want a perfume collection, slowly procure some of the ones that they recommend.<br /><br />I learned a couple of things already:  not to avoid \\"Lovely\\" because it's associated with a fairly main-stream celebrity and to give \\"Tommy Girl\\" a try.  I don't think I've ever given TG a sniff because the names seems so--well, Charlie's Angels or something.  I need to get over that.  I also have a long list of things I want to try.<br /><br />Each perfume reviewed gets a two word snappy description, such as \\"fruity barbershop\\", \\"cheap shampoo\\", and  \\"carnation booze\\".  Of course there are many superlatives as well.  Then a lengthier review follows.<br /><br /> I especially enjoyed the discussions of perfumes that are rated \\"recommended\\" or \\"masterpiece\\".  Many reviews are really educations in themselves such as the reviews for \\"Bandit,\\" \\"Derby,\\" \\"No. 5,\\" \\"Pleasures,\\" \\"White Linen\\" and many others.  These are comprised of beautifully crafted sentences that manage to pull off a hat-trick of being lyrically poetical, scientifically informative, and intensely beautiful and witty.<br /><br />Some of the shorter reviews are more sardonic, even cruel, but accurate.  Just because J. Lo. signs off on a perfume does not make it pantheonistic and her reps should learn that.  I think that the darker reviews seem correct, insofar as my familiarity goes, which (to be honest) is about as far as Muncie, Indiana, but we don't all get to Paris as much as we'd like.<br /><br />I love the writing; I love the information; I think that the list is fairly well-inclusive but here's where I part ways a bit:  too much time is spent on celebrities:  why not mention the ones that are outstanding.  Don't even give Paris Hilton a line.  Why include Britney Spears if you omit Alan Cumming?<br /><br />Some newer, smaller houses get short shrift--if this book is revised, I'd suggest looking at only a couple of Bond No. 9's and adding some more of the smaller houses.  Better still why not a history of great houses or almost great houses?  Perhaps an idea for a new books?  Houses ranging from the old and venerable to the new.

Some of the shorter reviews are more sardonic, even cruel, but accurate.  Just because J. Lo. signs off on a perfume does not make it pantheonistic and her reps should learn that.  I think that the darker reviews seem correct, insofar as my familiarity goes, which (to be honest) is about as far as Muncie, Indiana, but we don't all get to Paris as much as we'd like.    I love the writing; I love the information; I think that the list is fairly well-inclusive but here's where I part ways a bit:  too much time is spent on celebrities:  why not mention the ones that are outstanding.  Don't even give Paris Hilton a line.  Why include Britney Spears if you omit Alan Cumming?      Some newer, smaller houses get short shrift--if this book is revised, I'd suggest looking at only a couple of Bond No. 9's and adding some more of the smaller houses.  Better still why not a history of great houses or almost great houses?  Perhaps an idea for a new books?  Houses ranging from the old and venerable to the new.

0452289963|4.0|This is a book where you might find yourself reading over and over just to allow the content to 'soak in.'  I really liked the option of downloading the Podcast through Oprah.com as an accompaniment to the book.  You can down load all of the chapters or one at a time.
B00133KFGW|5.0|Wow! This movies suprised a lot of my friends and family.  It was a wonderful story about a young man who came through insurmountable odds, based on the simple belief that he would prevail.  His acting was very natural and fluent. The way the movie catapolted you into it felt a lot like Mr. Hollands Opus. Know one could not be cheering for the character at the movie's end. His love of music was insperational and driven. We have recommened it to several family friends and have borrowed ours out as well.  Why it did not do better at the box office is beyond me.  No guns and violence doesn't mean it lacked in the drama department. It was beautiful.
B000002L9J|5.0|I thought there would not be a difference in the sound quality between the \\"regular\\" CD version currently available and this Japanese \\"super high\\" material version, - just hype to sell the same album again -but there is! When compared in a computer (iTunes, straight WAV import - no compression or conversion to MP3) this version sounded only a tad louder, but clearer and sharper than the US Sire pressing. I don;t know if it's Japanese remastering or the CD material they use, but there is definitely a difference. If you can afford it and you love this album, get it before it's gone.
B00005JPOO|5.0|I loved this movie! I knew it was going to be good, but it turned out a lot better then i expected! It taught a good lesson, to like yourself the way you are and was just wonderful! The acting was also really good, i haven't seen Christina Ricci in a movie in a while.
0307394549|4.0|I bought this book as I was looking for some interesting cookies to make and share for our wedding.  This book didn't dissapoint, and of the 5-6 recipies I've made, all have turned out well and been tasty.  Good directions, and I especially like that there are pictures of the \\"finished product\\" so that you know what it's supposed to look like.    All in all, a solid book for someone who loves cookies.
B000WCBPOG|5.0|I've been a Beatles fan for over 35 years.  Though it seems almost sacrilegious to say so, some of these re-recordings are better than the originals.
B0014Z4OQG|3.0|Don't follow the idiot who follows his emotions and gets everyone killed.  This movie can make anyone feel like a genius.  Two complaints, it was to short, and there seems to be a lot of fools in these types of movies.  Then again, it is probably a fair representation of how most people would react.
1591396190|5.0|This book is excellent for people who are specialized on Marketing, easy to apply on real life because it has a lot of real life examples.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|In Rainbows represents almost everything good there is about Radiohead past Pablo Honey, maybe with the exception of harder rock side displayed on The Bends and the brilliant first half of OK Computer. Experimentations similar to Kid A, Amnesiac and Hail To The Thief are now subdued. This time, rhythms abound, mesmerizing textures weave their spell successfully. After the guitar-laden first two tracks, the mood changes for a more reflective one, making for strings and synths playing  in various sonic landscapes, sometimes in even warmer colors than ever before (All I Need, Reckoner). Fans should embrace In Rainbows quickly, the unconverted may have just been waiting for this. With Plant/Krauss collaboration Raising Sand, In Rainbows is easily among the best albums of 2007 and among the cream of the decade as well.
B0002VEPRQ|4.0|Mary Poppins is a Walt Disney classic. Julie Andrews plays the title role and she won an Oscar for her flawless performance. Andrews is pure delight, wish I had a nanny like her as a youngster. Dick Van Dyke is a gem as well, great songs and dance numbers. Mary Poppins is a family treasure to be enjoyed over and over again. I highly recommend it.
B00005KB9W|5.0|I bought this on vinyl (still have it) when it first came out.  Listen to these songs and picture them in today's context of Darfur, Iraq, Global Hunger! No one has before, then, or now described the plight of the underclass better or with a spirit of hope as Bob M.
0141027592|1.0|The Bible says in 2 Peter 2:1, Acts 20:30, Matt 24:11 and 1 Tim 4:1 that many false teachers and doctrines will arise upon the scene, deceiving many and drawing them away from God's Truth.

0316113506|5.0|Modern America is in love with fitness. It seems that the quest for the body beautiful has reached epidemic proportions. However, most people only think about the physical benefits of exercise. It should come as no surprise that exercise is a good idea - for the body and the mind. Although marketing gurus would have us believe that everyone in America owns a Bowflex or an Ab-Roller, it seems that the result of our overly sedentary lifestyle has largely caught up with us.    Mind you, this is not a novel idea. Even Plato conceded, \\"Lack of activity destroys the good condition of every human being, while movement and methodical exercise save it and preserve it.\\" This tome came to us from one of the very people who helped lay the philosophical foundation of Western culture.    Building upon this platonic idea that humans are genetically built to move, Dr. John Ratey provides an excellent development of the \\"why\\" behind exercise's importance. His book, Spark: the Revolutionary New Science of Exercise and the Brain provides enough scientific evidence to spark an interest in all readers.    Dr. Ratey includes a landmark case where a school in Illinois actually reversed a negative educational trend by incorporating an intense athletic regimen. His delving into the realities there demonstrates the connection between exercise and increased intellectual acumen. Many school districts, who are currently opining for the next \\"magical bullet\\" to fix their systems, might find their money better spent on heart rate monitors that prove their students are exercising in the right zone. This methodology worked wonders in Naperville, Illinois.    It seems that Dr. Ratey wants to destroy stereotypes of unintelligent athletes. Nothing could be further from the truth: more movement actually increases the brain's ability to learn. This book provides sufficient scientific detail to prove it - to a physician, teacher, or layman. Dr. Ratey, himself a clinical associate professor of psychiatry,has no intention to aim this work exclusively at the scientifically minded, however. Even the intermittent athlete can benefit from decreased tendencies toward stress, depression, or anxiety.    Armchair Interviews says: Who needs this book? Anyone who wants to be smarter - and understand \\"why\\" exercise can provide a kick start for the brain.
B000WZAE1I|5.0|I saw Stardust in the theaters and then ordered the DVD in advance of its release. I went to see it by myself on a whim one afternoon, and it took me totally by surprise. I wasn't expecting much, but this charming story took me down an unexpectedly delightful journey full of adventure, comedy and romance.<br /><br />The host of characters in this movie and the actors playing them are simply enchanting. The fallen star, played by Claire Danes, will break your heart and make you fall in love with her. Robert De Niro plays a secretly \\"gay\\" captain of a flying pirate ship, who is desperate to keep up appearances and maintain his reputation as a tough guy. Michelle Pfeiffer begins as an ugly old witch, who is instantly transformed into a stunningly beautiful yet deadly figure. She is fantastic in this role, as ravishing ever...looking not a day over 30. She hunts for the fallen star so she can kill it and cut out its heart for eternal youth. But each time she is forced to use her magic along the journey, it results in another step in a visible deterioration back to the old hag again. I especially enjoyed how the sons of the dead King, competing for the right to the throne, meet their demise one by one, and then reappear as a ghost. They are forced to hang out together with their other ghost brothers, watching the exploits and ultimate demise of their still living brothers, and providing additional comedy relief serving as a kind of peanut gallery, making comment on things going on. All the actors in this movie are wonderful.<br /><br />The first time I tried to describe the movie to someone, I said it reminded me of \\"The Princess Bride.\\" I have now heard that comparison made by many people. However, this movie is certainly more mature than Princess Bride, and more... magical. The characters and the acting is much more sincere, less tongue and cheek. The humor is more situational than slapstick. And it really is more than a comedy. It is a very sincere adventure/fantasy film, and certainly a romance.<br /><br />This is one of those rare movies that the whole family can enjoy!<br />One of those rare movies I don't mind seeing over and over again.<br />I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars!<br /><br />You can see other reviews of mine on my blog at: [...]ly a romance.

B00008972S|3.0|West Side Story is beloved musical but I could never get in to this classic. The Romeo & Juliet angle doesn't work in a musical style setting, it comes off corny and superficial. Natalie Wood is the bright point in this film, even though she didn't actually sing the songs, her performance is riveting, she was a special actress back then. Rita Moreno over acts, what's so great about her? West Side Story is good but not spectacular, decide for yourself on this one.
0525950079|5.0|After reading \\"Pillars of the Earth\\"  I did not think it was possible to top it, apparently I was wrong.  This is one of the best books I have ever read.  Follett's use of his characters in an tightly woven web is highly superior.  Good people becoming corrupt, formidable foes, and the righteous prevailing are all instances that make this novel attractive.  His use of frankness with his character descriptions really capture the picture of 14th century Europe.  Well Done!
B000066744|5.0|My favourite movie ever made....    At first it might seem a bit slow, but the film script is a well planned poem that stretches over two hours of pure artistic magic.    It is warm, funny , intellegent and so much more.....    You may think this is a one sided point of view but i'm in fact a massive science fiction and adventure movie fan so this review can be trusted.    The piano duel scene is one of the best scenes of cinema i have ever seen and Tim Roth is brilliant.    Enjoy!!!    Greetings from South Africa!!    Jaco
B0007ORU66|5.0|This is a great cd of non album songs.I do not know why this album is not released? It has a differnt version of revolution that is different than the white album version this one is more of a rock version. If you want a good beatles cd this is the one to get.The song rain is a hard to find song that is one of the best on this album.So i would get this album before it gets harder to find.
B000SFJWLU|5.0|From the second I heard the growling at the beginning of \\"Ashes\\" to the Final notes of \\"Meet the Monster\\" I was completely enthralled.  For their first outing, this album is very impressive.  Not only do they give you the metal view of life, \\"everything I touch becomes ashes,\\" and their outlook on orginized religion \\"Salvation,\\" but you also hear the brutal soft side in \\"The Bleeding\\"  I'm expecting to hear great things from these guys come the sophomore album.  I can't wait to see them kick aspirin on stage at this summers Mayhem Festival!  [....]Keep up the good work guys!!  See you in Seattle!
0843108169|5.0|I thought this book was cute and so do all the children--about 40 of them total--that I've read it to in classes.  Mr. Nosey has a problem with wanting to know everyone's business...and the town is tired of it! What happens is cute---I know of some people that need this lesson in a HUGE way!  Cute book.
B000EBD9TY|5.0|A Streetcar Named Desire is a rare film, no don't make movies like this anymore. It's based on a Tennessee Williams play of the same name, I have always enjoyed the screen adapations to his intense plays. Marlon Brando, Kim Hunter, Vivien Leigh, and Karl Malden are smoldering together. All four actors are extremely talented and Leigh's performance as aging southern belle, Blanche Du Bois is so heartbreaking and real. I highly recommend this timeless black & white classic!
B000641Z90|5.0|This is what I want to have from every musician:  To present a DVD that's worth the price and a must have in a collection.<br /><br />Phil Collins and his band is more that amazing on stage.  Having the lots of features that includes almost all songs original video is the best of this production.<br /><br />If you really like to add something of great value to your collection do not hesitate to buy this.
B0012HEB32|5.0|First, I was a Linda Hamilton fan.  I thought her role in the first two Terminator movies was the cement that held everything together.  However, Linda is 51 years old now and she really shows her age and not anywhere nearly as buff as she was in T2.  Lena Headey is about the same age Linda was, in her early thirties when Linda was in T2 which fits in the right time line. Lena's doing okay for a British actor portraying an American and I find her convincing as a hardened and calloused Sarah Connor.  As for the writing that one critic wannabe scorned, is not Gone with the Wind nor pretends to be.  William Wisher and James Cameron collaborated on T2 and the writing was not all that great either, but the story itself was.  I have four versions of T2 and will acquire my Blu Ray version shortly making five and on my short list of my all time favorite movies. T:SSC is an honorable endeavor for a television series. I am surprised that it is as good as it is given that budgets for a television series are lean to start with in comparison to their predecesors on the big screen. It perpetuates the Terminator franchise much to the delight of Terminator fans. The series opens limitless possibilities in  story lines and I like the soap opera aspect much the same way I did with the shadow government story line of X-Files. Both Lena Headey and Summer Glau are established actors in their own right, Heady appeared in Brothers Grimm and Glau in Serenity, and are premium talent for a television series. Summer Glau, 27 yoa, is very convincing as the second female terminator and she looks young enough to portray a high school junior or senior.    Twenty one year old Thomas Dekker has a more difficult time trying to be someone five years younger than he is.  In high def, he has the noticable five o'clock shadow of a mature adult male, but still, John Connor grew up fast.  One can nit pick at all the little shortcomings and all that does is prevent one can from enjoying a hour's escapism.My only fear is that the series will end long before all the story ideas have been done because of burnout by the cast.
B0000042MY|5.0|The DVD was received in a timely manner in the original case.  The movie is as good as I remember it!  Very clear picture and soundtrack.
0307277887|2.0|The writing is very good.  Jeff Lindsay has an unmatched knack for alliteration and the words seemed to flow with a smoothness unmatched by most author.  At times it is almost like reading poetry.  But the subject matter is very disturbing.  Dexter is described as a serial killer with a conscience because he only kill other serial killers.  And in this book he is after a killer who is murdering local prostitutes.    I hate reading about innocent people getting hurt especially women and this book has plenty of it.  And the killer leaves the bodies of his victims cut up and posed for Dexter to find which in and of itself is very disturbing.  But even worse Dexter begins to view the savage murder displays as some sort of art.  And begins to feel a very strong empathy for the killer.  It was sickening to hear him describe savage murder scenes as beautiful and right.  And the killings were horrible.  You meet a few of the victims before they are killed and get to see their terror.  And later see their dismembered bodies posed in childish displays for Dex.      Plus the ending was very confusing.  I was unsure if Brian got away.  Or if Dex had gone completely insane and killed Deb.    I saw the TV show once and liked it so I picked up the book but it was much darker than I expected.  This is the sort of book that puts bad thoughts in your head.  The only positive I can say about this book is that Jeff Lindsay's writing is superb if very dark.
B0001ZX0OW|3.0|Mystic River directed by Clint Eastwood is very unsettling and difficult film to watch. The beginning is tragic and the rest of the movie is a bit slow and one-dimensional. This is not Eastwood's best film, but the acting is superb thanks to Sean Penn. The performance that surprised me the most was Tim Robbins, he never stood out in his movies but this one he does and it's amazing. This film is a mixed bag, decide for yourself.
B000V8I2QU|1.0|The only \\"MAGIC\\" was them fooling fans into buying this waste of plastic. This is the Last time I buy springsteen without reading lotsa real reviews first. In fact I will never buy one of his albums again until Bruce gives me a good sounding copy to replace this. I have to think that many of the 5 star reviews are written by marketing people. With the very sad state of music today one would think it would be easy for a great writer like Springsteen to be a hit once again. Sad to say this is his very worst album ever, and yes i own almost all. The writing is very poor with maybe 2 slightly decent songs. The sound quality is terrible, I'm thinking maybe they are making this music to sound good on ear buds because on my very nice stereo it sounds like crud. Bruce was once one of my very favorite artists but now like that old favorite sports star you just wish he would retire with some dignity. Instead get a Darius Rucker album, he always has top notch sound Quality or go buy a Wilco album, you won't be dissapointed. Do not buy this album!
0790729377|1.0|This is a very good, touching and terrifying at times film about how people use, intimidate and ill-treat each other even among families.  A poor, long-suffering lady is close to a mental breakdown and comes to seek out her sister for help but in the end this only leads to a totally opposite outcome.  Both Leigh and Brando put in excellent performances here and so does Karl Malden who together with Brando would go on to even better things with \\"On the Waterfront.\\"<br /><br />The problem is with the DVD which hasn't been restored at all making for very, very poor picture and sound quality.  With the advent of Blu-Ray, here's hoping they would take this opportunity to totally remaster this film and to add good bonus features which are totally missing here.  Dolby Digital 5.1 surround or DTS THX sound options would be a real treat.<br /><br />This is a good film but I recommend you wait for a much better restored version to surface and not to waste your hard earned money on this very, very poor DVD version.

B00003CXCW|4.0|This movie came not too long after another great film noir offering by Wilder: \\"Double Indemnity\\" and as much as I liked that movie, I find myself preferring this his other film noir masterpiece.  The casting on this film was inspired and there are so many layers of brilliance on this film that it's like peeling an onion and discovering more and more potent layers each time you watch this film.<br /><br />Gloria Swanson was brilliant and would have won the best actress award had this film been released either a year earlier or later instead of having to contend with another brilliant film that year:\\"All About Eve\\".  There are so many brilliant moments in this film that some of the dialogue has been immortalized over the years e.g. \\"I'm ready for my close up now Mr. DeMille\\" and \\"I AM big, it's the pictures that got small\\" etc  There are many special scenes that you have to see to enjoy for yourself which show the striking differences between the old and the new, the twisted and the sane etc that makes this not just any film but as close as it comes to film fine art as they come.  A scathing attack on Hollywood and how people use each other at any price which must be close to the truth to have generated such anger from the movie moguls at the time.<br /><br />This DVD version is also a treat as it has very good bonus features such as \\"The Music of Sunset Boulevard\\", \\"The Making of Sunset Boulevard\\" and my favourite \\"Edith Head - The Paramount Years\\"  Edith was parodied so well by the way in that Disney cartoon \\"The Invincibles\\" as the costume lady.  The picture quality is also very good with only a few frames of imperfection but not enough to get too upset about.  The only thing that should have been done was for Dolby 5.1 or DTS THX surround options to be provided in addition to the Dolby Mono version here.  Hopefully a Blu-Ray release is imminent which will offer these improvements in sound quality for the film.<br /><br />This is one movie that I'm actually proud to have in my library and I can see myself viewing this over and over again over the years just to peel yet another brilliant layer from this glorious onion each time I watch.<br /><br />This is movie-making at it's best and comes highly recommended.d I can see myself viewing this over and over again over the years just to peel yet another brilliant layer from this glorious onion each time I watch.    This is movie-making at it's best and comes highly recommended.
0810994739|4.0|This second book is,as the title, states, less of more. The first book was great and I found myself indentifying with the main character.  The second book I was less sure.  Stil.it's a wonderful tale of woe, book 1 and 2. I love them both.
B00132D808|5.0|I thought this album was really good. It had a real Beatles feel to many of the songs but still kept the individuality of Panic. I really recommend this.
B000YABYLA|1.0|An overrated movie about a smart mouthed, unlikable, disenchanting little girl, who just happens to get pregnant who also has idiot parents. Obnoxious dialogue, poorly directed.    Insignificant rubbish that only SHEEP of its nature could enjoy.    Oh, and there isn't one neither likeable nor real character in this farce of a movie.
B000005J08|5.0|Naked City are primarily an avant-jazz thrash-metal band, however, their radical music fuses stylistic boundaries. This legendary debut album from Naked City includes beautiful renditions of \\"The Sicilian Clan\\" (Ennio Morricone), \\"Lonely Woman\\" (Ornette Coleman), \\"I Want To Live!\\" (Johnny Mandell), \\"The James Bond Theme\\" (John Barry), \\"Contempt\\" (Georges Delerue). Naked City were also known for performing an extensive array of cover songs throughout their live performances worldwide.
B000J0NIIW|2.0|My mother-in-law saw this sweeper on TV and asked for it for her birthday.   I bought two, since my Shark sweeper is no longer holding its charge.  I think I should have bought another Shark.  The Ontel Sweeper is very light and the swivel head certainly swivels - almost to the point of not being able to control it.  But I think the thing I dislike most about it, is the tray.  It is so small and awkward to empty.  I have three large dogs and I use the portable sweeper on my kitchen floor.  The Ontel just isn't up to the job around here.  Hopefully my dogless mother-in-law will enjoy hers when I give it to her next month.
B000MRAAJM|4.0|If you want to really showcase your Hi-Def setup, this compilation will be sure to please.    PROS: Great transfer & 1080p quality bring everything to life and you will never look at our world the same. Be prepared to be stunned when you first glimpse the Great White attacking the seals. I was in awe not in the brutality but in the cinematic scope and incredible camera shots/angles used. Sir David Attenborough brings a great voice to the entire narrative.    CONS: Unfortunate that the Blu-Ray version contains nary a whiff of extra material that are jam-packed on the standard DVD version. It would have been nice to get some behind-the-scenes docs (in HD) plus insights by the  people behind the lens and Mr. Attenborough himself. Not only is the Blu-Ray version missing this bonus content it also costs more than the standard DVD version!    All in all, despite the shortcomings, this package is nearly perfect. Great sound, great picture plus educational for the entire family to enjoy over and over again.
B0015I2P0Y|3.0|You have to give Guy and the band respect for trying to do something new, even if they don't always succeed.  Right off in \\"Starlings\\", what would be a rather normal ballad kind of song is broken by big bursts of sound you don't expect, then they do the opposite in the next song, finishing it off not with the expected shoegazer cascade they seemed headed for, but a short nearly silent horn coda.<br /><br />If the music didn't ring no amount of clever touches, good lyrics and Guy's street-affected voice would amount to anything, and that's were this falls flat.  \\"Divorce\\" doesn't work much for me except in the middle, \\"Pope\\" and especially \\"Fix\\" are too novelty (I hate novelty), \\"Crane\\" drags a bit, and they'd be far better known if there were the occasional big hook, which is lacking.  I don't rate Coldplay's latest very high, but the key hooks in \\"Birds\\" and \\"Talk\\" sold a few million CD's (and make my favorites playlist), and if you're comparing this to Coldplay, as some do, there you are.<br /><br />I don't know, it's been awhile, they're no longer freshman, and I still don't have a solid place for Elbow on my playlist.  I think the pieces are there, but maybe they need to be less interesting; more cake, less frosting.
B000R7I3LY|4.0|Well written, well sung.  LOVED her inital single...Love Song....enjoyed her album after a few spins.  But I was not immediately taken to it.
B00005LC1H|5.0|This is a very funny series, and this DVD set has all of the episodes of FAWLTY TOWERS : what more could anyone ask for? If you think John Cleese was funny in MONTY PYTHON'S FLYING CIRCUS you will probably enjoy him in FAWLTY TOWERS. All the other cast members are great as well.
B000Y1ZXUM|5.0|I think this concert was exceptional.  If people want to see Madonna and Celine Dion presentations, then watch Madonna and Celina Dion.  You cannot compare Shakira to anybody.  She's got her own style and it works for her.  This concert is great.  Worthwhile.  I strongly recommend it.
B000E41MS6|5.0|I had a period of fanatical Doctor Who adoration in my past; during college Tom Baker was on, and I adored him.  I lived for my half hour of Doctor Who on Saturday nights!  But time passed and the Doctor faded out of my life...    Now, all these years later I've finally watched Season One of the new Doctor Who, and I'd have to say that I am MORE obsessed than ever.  Christopher Eccleston is every bit as good as everyone says.  He captures the Doctor's wit, charm, mystery and depth with grace and style.  Billie Piper as Rose Tyler is a delight.  The chemistry between the two just makes the show; it is as much about them as it is about him.      The plots are full of the usual Doctor Who outrageousness and wacky weirdness, although with a modern edge, an often scary edge.  Still, the characters shine through, and the supporting cast is generally superb.
B000IOM1YG|5.0|I've waited for years for a quality digital remastering of any Alan Parons Project CD. I must ad to the other reviews that this Pyramid remaster just wipes out the US issue Arista CD. Finally, the sound is now completely fleshed out and uncompressed even beyond my best vinyl pressings more like hearing a master tape! This is one my favorite Alan Parons Project works, great production and music that stands the test of time. Now I hope Turn of a Friendly Card and I Robot gets the same level of remastering.
B000TLMWLK|5.0|This the BEST!!    I am a huge Johnny Cash fan and this is just like watching him 'for real'    Anyone who is a fan of JC/country music will love this DVD--it takes you back in time to the days when country music was more than contrified rock music and TV was worth watching...and is priced just right.
B000002MFE|5.0|It's Eric Clapton - intimate and unplugged - playing some great blues and acoustic rock.  Does life get any better than that?  Everyone needs this CD!
B00000DRV8|5.0|First of all, let me state right away that the 1991 version of Chicago II is two discs long.  For some reason, even though the total time of both albums combined is only 65 minutes (and up to 80 minutes can fit on a single music disc) they decided to make the album two separate discs anyway.  But the sound quality is AMAZINGLY good.  All the horns and guitar playing is very clean, clear, and loud.      I'd say for Chicago's second effort, the amount of horns included has increased a LOT.  Horns totally dominate the first disc (the first half) and during the second half some wild experimental ideas into the world of soundtrack/classical take place for several minutes (it's actually the ending of the \\"Ballet for a Girl in Buchannon\\" suite) before the albums ends on the lyrically powerful \\"It Better End Soon\\" movement, which brings the sound back to the rock and roll horns and guitars we've come to expect Chicago to implement into their sound.      That one classical movement sure is strange though. It stands out compared to the rest of the album, and doesn't really fit following immediately after \\"25 or 6 to 4\\".  Oh well, it's a great album (and recommend for vocal melody fans) but I recommend Chicago III as your first Chicago purchase.  THAT album has it all folks.
B00006RAKP|5.0|Elton John's greatest hits from \\"Crocodile Rock\\" to \\"The Way You Look Tonight\\" and all points between.  For any Elton John fan looking for all his best-known songs in one package, give this one a hook.
B000001FRY|5.0|Easily one of U2's most underrated albums, Boy is a very melodic and interesting album from start to finish.  This was when U2 was in the beginning stages of their career, and focused on writing memorable hooks and quality songwriting.  One the bands best albums in fact, right next to October.  A masterpiece like this has to be treated with the respect it deserves.
B00004THAY|5.0|This disc is pure fun from start to finish.  It's two old blues guys (yes, old, sorry guys!) singing and playing guitar.  It's awesome, brilliant and above all it's a blast to listen to for any fan of the blues, BB or Clapton, or a good way to get someone hooked on the blues for the first time!
0525950079|5.0|Good sequel to \\"Pillars ....\\", although not QUITE as good as \\"Pillars\\". Still, I would recommend it highly. Gosh, it's GOT to be pretty good if I made it thru another 1000 pages .... WOW! (and I DID).

1594200823|4.0|The fact is that we're omnivores. Huge number of vegetables (but not all), fruits (but not all), fish (but not all), and other sources (but not all) will feed us quite nicely. So, once the toxicity question is out of the way, and it's a big one, the dilemma remains: what's for supper? Why? How did it get there? What moral statement does that make? And how much do you really enjoy eating it? Feeding is a biological function, but dining is an art form, or should be. Which are you doing?<br /><br />Pollan throws himself into these questions' answers. He traces a set of meals from their origin to his pan and palate. It turns out that each trace represents a specific set of human values, societal norms, and decisions that most people rarely realize have been made. His hi-tech foray starts with one of the earliest and most bizarre of genetic engineering feats: the neolithic taming of corn, making the species utterly dependent on agriculture for reproduction. He then follows modern corn from the field to the feedlot, where it fattens a cow ankle-deep in manure, to the ominously closed gates of the slaughterhouse - \\"food security,\\" or so they say. In other adventures, he converts the animal to meat with his own hands. It happens once at a farm that's gone back to the ideals of organic farming but with different goals, and again as a modern hunter-gatherer.<br /><br />Each trek ends in a finished meal. His family consumes the modern industrialized McMeal on the road, but he shepherds the others through his kitchen and onto the plates of his friends and family. At every step, he considers the substance of the food, along with the many social ramifications of each part of its preparation. Some episodes amuse, others appall to some extent, as they should. All of them, however, inform and invite the readers to consider their own lives and means of staying alive. Just what are you eating? And why?<br /><br />-- wiredweird
0743554450|5.0|I listened to the audio book version of this story.  I enjoyed it very much.  I liked the characters and I became very attached to the outcome of the story.  I also liked how it was told from the perspective of the women.  Politics played a peripheral part of the story, really only as much as these women knew about or heard from their husbands or family.  But the political atmosphere shaped the lives of these women, and so we experienced the changes in governments over the years through their lives and their experiences.  It was a wonderful book and it was a very nice \\"listen.\\"  My only complaint is that it was a bit verbose, there were more descriptions about mundane things than were necessary.  But I realize the author was trying to convey a mental image of the lifestyle and situation that these women were living through, so I forgive the lengthy details.  :)
B0013XS8A2|1.0|Oldfield has produced a limited number of great albums: \\"TB\\", \\"Hergest Ridge\\", \\"Ommadawn\\", \\"Incantations\\", and \\"Amarok\\". Everything after 1978 - with the sole exception of \\"Amarok\\" - has been a huge dissapointment. Gee, this man's music for a short while was almost close to Reich, Glass, Adams (when having released Incantations) in quality.    \\"Music of the Spheres\\" is another dissapointment. It is not comparable to the well done \\"Orchestral TB\\". No, not even remotely. Instead it sounds as if someione was in desperate need for cheap background music for a psychatrist's waiting room. That's all there is to it. A pale, pale shadow of the genius Oldfield once was.
B000OYC3J8|5.0|When I first heard that the latest cd for the White Stripes would be hitting the stores soon, I was excited.  As a longtime fan, I own all of their music.  Before I could buy the cd the music videos for the songs 'Icky Thump' and 'Conquest' began playing everywhere.  Even though I was absolutely sure I would be buying the cd without hearing a song on it, I was pleased to see that the White Stripes sounded better than ever.  The music videos caught the attention of my son (age 16) who remembered that I had the older White Stripes cds.  He began listening to them back to back.  So, when I finally bought the latest cd, he wanted to listen to it also.  I started spending the mornings in his room searching for the new cd, while he began spending the afternoons after school searching my room for the new cd.  It just goes to show how the sound of the White Stripes is crossing over into several generations. The music of Jack and Meg is across the board, in that, they have a blues song, grass roots song, punk song, rock song, and folk song on the same album. Although,'Icky Thump' and 'Conquest' seem to be the favorites of this new album, I favor the song 'Rag and Bone'.         Much like the music on the cds of the White Stripes, the artwork on the albums are confined within the style that is the Whites!  Often a black and white photo with red splashes of color and objects of symbolism always continue to show just how complete their albums are in design and thought.  This cd sounds as fun as the cover photos where Meg and Jack are dressed like characters out of a scene from 'Mary Poppins'.  In contrast, the photos inside the cd booklet are simple and carefree, while maintaining the expression that Jack and Meg balance each other.  I am suggesting the cd 'Icky Thump' to friends and family.  As a fan, I often have candycane dreams of White Stripes!
B00001QEFU|3.0|\\"Under the Blade\\" features a \\"different\\" sound than what most SMF's might expect from Twisted Sister. The songs are at times very similar to early Black Sabbath. Plodding, dirge-like tunes with only flashes of the hair-metal like guitar riffs they would popularize with \\"Stay Hungry\\". Tunes like \\"Destoryer\\" and \\"Sin after Sin\\" emphasize this. Both feature a slower, plodding pace that emphasize A.J. Pero's drumwork and Mark Mendoza's bass. The screaming guitars take a backseat on these songs, and they aren't bad, just not what you would expect. On the other hand, tunes like \\"Under the Blade\\", \\"I'll Never Grow Up\\" and \\"What You Don't Know\\" are all shaded with what would become Twisted Sister's signature sound on \\"Stay Hungry\\" and \\"Come Out and Play\\". If you are a fan of the band, then this is a must own, but if your only interested in the hits...stick with \\"Stay Hungry\\" and download the title song from this disk.
B00139W3NE|1.0|I read all of three books of Dark Materials. I am very much aware of some \\"adjustments\\" of artistic licence in adapting the novels to the films.    After screening the film in widescreen format on DVD, I felt the film doesn't do the books any justice at all. They rearranged some of plots and omitted lot of materials just for sake of compressing the novel into 109 minutes. They could have make it 180 minutes like \\"Lord of the Rings\\". I would say next to Michael Crichton's \\"Timeline\\" this is the worst ever.     Those people who adapted the novel and made the film should never been allowed to ruin our experience. The author ought be ASHAMED for allowing his novels to be corrupted this way!    I hope the \\"Subtle Knife\\" and \\"Amber Spyglass\\" would be better with 180-minute length.

B00008BXJJ|5.0|Not only is this my favorite AC/DC album, it is also my favorite \\"live\\" album ... of any band. This is a collection of the best of AC/DC during a full year of touring.  It is a great companion piece to AC/DC \\"Live at Donington\\" (the best live DVD ever) ... One of the things I love about this one is the sound quality ... it has blistering highs and a deep bass tones for a very full-featured super-sonic boom. If you haven't seen the DVD, buy it here or rent it at Netflix ... you'll be glad you did.  It was filmed in 35 mm using 23 cameras (including a helicopter) during the 1991 Monsters of Metal concert where AC/DC were the headliners. Rock and Roll doesn't get any \\"live-r\\" than this.
0792163710|5.0|There are some movies that I buy that I have seen before.  This is one of them.  However, I probably will never watch it again since it is so sad.  I just like to have this type of movie in my library and remember the story when I see the name.  That may be a little wierd but I have many like that that are a comfort to have but heartbreakers to watch.    This movie came quickly and in good shape.  My brother did watch it and it was in perfect condition.
B00132D808|1.0|This a disgraceful album.  If you liked their first you wont like this at all.  This is so boring.  There is not electro influence like the first album.  There is not one dance track on this album or anything that would get a live crowd going.  If you want an album to smoke some weed to and sit around in a circle trying to bring back the sixties then you have found it.  If you want the panic! at the disco of old then forget it.  A complete travesty on this sophomore effort.  Go to your local record store and break these CD's so nobody has to be subjected to this garbage.
1594489505|5.0|Once again Khaleed has managed to capture his audience with yet another thought provoking human interest story. It takes you away to a far off and exotic place;where a lifestyle exists that we cannot possibly relate to. The story is tender, sad, and very emotional. A must read.
B000BMHVSQ|5.0|(This review is based on the Arrow Classic edition of the book)    Four years ago, I wrote a terrible review for this very novel, and it shames me to this day. I reread \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" last week, and to my surprise, I adored it. I remembered having experienced utter boredom the first time around, but now I know it was only because I did not know how to read, obviously.    Hemingway's use of economy of words and understatement are things you must be aware of, which means: simply because the style appears simple does not mean the text is. There is a lot more than meets the eye, and for this, one may easily miss out on the essential heart of the novel. This is certainly what I did on my first reading.     Short sentences perhaps tend to make the reader read faster, and that would be a fatal mistake with Hemingway. Because you have less, you must pay more attention. The narrative will not give you chewed meat: you have to do your own chewing. And this is Hemingway's strong point and trade-mark, and narratively speaking, it works wonders if you work with it. I was of the mind that his style only really worked for short stories, but \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" proved me wrong. This is a powerful novel, highly enjoyable, and a landmark in worldwide literature.    Certainly one of Hemingway's best, and one of those novels you must read!    PS: the Arrow Books edition contains numerous typos of the embarrassing type, not that they make funny new words, but \\"gve\\" instead of \\"give\\" is relatively awkward to find in a book, so are misspelled names and the likes, or forgotten quotation marks, all of which appear in the Arrow Books edition of the novel.
B00005JOA0|5.0|I bought this DVD because of Toby Stephens, and I can tell you was not the least bit disappointed in the DVD.  The acting is very good.  It is a very intense drama and I was glued to the TV watching it.  Mr. Stephens is a very good actor and good looking as well.  Tara Fitzgerald the lead actress played and made a very difficult role imagineable.  If you like drama, get it.

B0014BQQYS|4.0|The new Blu-ray release of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid will reportedly carry over only some of the special features of the 2006 SD Collector's Edition.

The video quality is reportedly about as good as can be expected, better than the SD release, particularly in color depth, but also showing more effectively the grain that was part of the filming process used in some scenes designed to look antique, perhaps more effectively than is desirable in some cases.

A combination of unconventional Western and buddy flick, it works well as drama and at least as well as comedy.

B0000TB01Y|3.0|Some reviewers use this forum to express disdain for the musical itself. I guess they're far too cultured to enjoy artwork meant for the plebes and proles (see Orwell). I attended the Chicago performance twice and enjoyed it immensely. Unfortunately (in a sense) the leads in Chicago in late 2007 and early 2008 had such powerful voices that the leads from the Broadway cast who recorded this CD suffer somewhat by comparison. Dee Roscioli (who appeared as Elphaba in Chicago) has an alto-like resonance and this contributed considerably to Wicked's solos.  Erin Mackey (Glinda in the same cast) delivered a bit of operatic soprano to her performance, and again this depth overcame what otherwise is a potentially girlish-sounding part. The two leading ladies on the CD sound a little thin by comparison. Without this first-hand experience, the CD would definitely rate 4-stars, perhaps even 5. One other criticism of the other reviews is that few people seem to grasp the clearly evident themes in Wicked. 1) Rulers are always and everywhere corrupt liars, 2) the citizenry is easily duped, made to believe absurdities and to thereby support hatred and violence, 3) the \\"official\\" version of history is often a 180-degree inversion of the truth, and 4) talented individuals who think for themselves are, throughout history, reviled by the tyrants who rule and by the common man (see quotations of H.L. Mencken).  Get the CD and enjoy it. See the show live and *really* enjoy it.     [Oh, and look up the novel Revolutionary Language on Amazon....]
B000JRYOPG|2.0|The movie was okay, It really didn't tickle my fancy. Every main character in the film obviously doesn't like a woman of colored - What was that all about? I am totally surprise multi-racial women weren't been betrayed as some type of trophy. Ky- Mani was the man for real though.
B000ZN8036|4.0|I'll let you peruse the movie plot through other reviewers.<br /><br />I recall when I saw this classic in the theater thinking: \\"Wow...can't wait for the commentary on this!\\"<br /><br />When I rented what I believe is the single disc version of the movie from Netflix, no commentary...and it doesn't look like it's on this special edition either.  That's a total gyp.<br /><br />Maybe I'm being overly critical here, but this is one of those movies THAT COMMENTARY WAS CREATED FOR.  It's the PERFECT movie for it... It's dying for it!!!<br /><br />I'm going to wait for it to be available on Blu-ray, which I think is worth the wait with the scenery of Alaska and all.<br /><br />Then perhaps they'll wake up and grace us with the presence of Sean Penn's (or someone's) commentary to enhance the story of our character Mr. Supertramp!
6305161879|5.0|Monty Python's John Cleese once again offers up a spectacular example of what makes him such a revered comedic force.  Written by Cleese and set in London, this comedy has the drama of a bank robbery and subsequent legal proceedings and a romantic twist.  Yet, this is not a \\"chick flick\\" by any means.  Cleese's Monty Python buddy Michael Palin delivers a stellar performance as the stuttering hold-up sidekick, as JC plays the barrister (defense lawyer) for the man who organized the robbery.  Again...since Cleese wrote it and sets it in London, there are only 2 American main characters (which in typical British form) Cleese busts on by giving them playfully negative American stereotypes: Jamie Lee Curtis plays a girl who will (let's keep it clean) \\"hook up with\\" and then stab in the back anyone who can make her rich.  And Kevin Kline plays an obnoxious, loud-mouthed vulgarian who pretends to be smart and classy, but truly shows no intelligence and is gauche and tasteless.  Don't take it too seriously though, my fellow Americans....this movie is great fun!  The story unfolds beautifully, and the subtly developing romance between Cleese and Curtis (which begins as an opportunistic ruse by Curtis that blossoms into something more) is handled quite well.  For fans of British comedy, there are also small appearances by other British stars such as Geoffrey Palmer and Steven Frye as well.  Cleese, who has given us so much in the world of comedy, delivers once again!  5 stars to this wonderful comedy classic!
B00177Y9ZM|4.0|Although I can understand Hayden not being a top-rate actor, I think he does provide a decent performance for his genre. I feel as though he is given a bad rap when, well, in star wars he was kind of supposed to be a whiny teenager and in jumper he was supposed to be a dumb kid.    I felt the movie was quite entertaining. Period. Alot of people felt they wasted their time with the movie talking about how some things didn't make sense and how these people didn't explain themselves enough blah blah blah. Bottom line, it's a movie meant to entertain. I'm baffled by these people on here trash talking the movie when clearly we all know that Samuel L. Jackson doesn't do a whole lot of top shelf movies. Walk in to the theatre looking to be entertained, walk out entertained. Walk in pretending like you want to be entertained, walk out trash talking.    If you liked the bourne movies and don't mind filling in a few gaps, you'll enjoy the movie. The movie reminds me alot of Transformers, though I don't hear many bad reviews for THAT.    Flame on, but I probably wont look back.
B000YDOOU0|4.0|I got to see Metheny test out some of this music in a small club a few years back.  It was a great show, and it translated well into studio material.  Just Pat accompanied by bass and drums...a simple formula with delightful results.  I don't want to talk this CD to death.  If you know Pat's work, this is a wonderful, must-have sample of his material.  If you're fairly new to Pat...give him a try.  As I've said in other reviews, I'm not sure if I should classify him as straightforward instrumental electric (and occasionally acoustic) jazz or the lighter side of fusion.  But, Pat has a unique sound, with a knack for sounding both uplifting and melancoly at the same time.  This is simply fantastic...just Pat on guitar with bass and drums...simple formula with fantastic results!  Enough said!
B000NA2776|5.0|Since we bought this C.D., my wife and I can't stop listening to it. It's fresh, it's fun and it's a great buy. His voice reminds of Freddy Mercury, but Mika has a distinct style that separates him form everything we've heard before. A true must for every music aficionado!.
B000002GBJ|4.0|A short but impressive prog rock classic you could call instrumental if pushed into the issue.  I'd gladly give it 5 stars if not for production values that are poor enough in spots that they can't be ignored.  The writing and performances by everyone involved is brilliant.  Most of his fellow band members from Yes pop up in various places on the album.  Wakeman is a guy that any real musician must admire.  He always blends rock and classical music together nimbly in a way that seems so natural and comfortable.  All the songs are original (except for a minute or so at the end of one tune where he plays a classical piano version of an old British hymn over background female voices [not singing lyrics, just adding voices] that beautifully compliments RW's original tune).  RW uses a large variety of keyboards, expressing the range of technology (including multiple tracking) which was a hallmark of early '70s music.  There are spots where it is difficult to tell if the backing vocals are sung or played on keyboards...and since vocals are rare on this work and lyrics are NEVER involved, just mood vocals, sometimes he mixes singers and keyboards to create the impression of backing vocals.  One stand-out tune is even recorded mostly on a pipe organ in St. Giles Catholic Cathedral in London, and that is one of my favorite tunes on what is still one of my favorite Wakeman solo albums.  The poor production values become painfully hard to ignore during one or two songs where what were presumably guitar solos were completely drowned out in the music, and you can barely tell they were supposed to exist at all.  In fact, you could play this album and not even notice any guitar solos.  All in all, even though this is a short concept album with poor production values, it is still one of my favorite prog rock albums from the era!  I highly recommend it!
B00127RAJY|5.0|Humbled and very Happy about this.  When I ordered this I was pleased to see that it had an \\"advanced workout\\".  \\"Oh Good\\" I thought, a workout that will challenge me (thinking I am some sort of fit queen).  I put in the DVD, and thought....\\"I am tired this morning so I think I will take it easy and do the EASY workout\\".  So it began.  5 minutes into the EASY workout, I was completely humiliated by my arrogance, and how little I had really pushed myself....PROBABLY ever.    I love The Biggest Loser.  As I have only about 20 lbs to loose and am in pretty good shape, I always thought that their exhaustion and effort was due to their size.  This could not be farther from the truth.  Jillian puts you through a realistic but amazing short, and totally challenging work out.  Plus her coaching while you are dying, is excellent.  I think she is quite a remarkable woman and I am delighted to be humbled by this work-out experience.  I am a looooooooooong way from the \\"Advanced Workout\\", but I know I will get their soon.  Plus I look forward to finally loosing the weight.  FABULOUS.

0452289963|5.0|This book was suggested by my acupuncturest after I had told him about my furstration with relationships in my life. I found it helpful and useful in learning why people response so negatively to situations they are in. I also learned a lot about myself and why I response like I do.  If you are looking for peace in your relationships with yourself and others this is a good way to go.  But if you find this book a little too much to chew try reading The Four Agreements by Don Migual Ruiz first. It is short, simple, and to the point. It has also been life changing for many people I personally know, including myself. I suggest that everyone read this book first before reading A New Earth. It layed down a foundation and an understanding of how to put some of A New Earth info. into action. If you really like the The Four Agreements, make sure you read The Four Agreements Companion. That helped me put into practice the Four Agreements. I think the Negative Rewiews on A New Earth are from people who are not ready to change or thier ego has gotten a hold of them.  Maybe they would have been better off reading The Four Agreements First.  =-) p.s. The above books including A New Earth is an outstanding course to start on if you are suffering from Anxiety and you are ready to let it go.
B0017XD3OY|3.0|While watching this movie I actually believed that for the first time in a long time I was watching a movie that made my heart pump and still surprised me with unpredictability.  The last movie to do that for me was Alien.<br /><br />Will Smith is simply outstanding, and creates a role both convincing and provoking.  His companion also does an amazing job and combined really made me care about their outcome enough to see this movie through, white knuckles and all.<br /><br />Also, the best part about this action thriller is that it wasn't an all out blood and gore fest.  Where most films of this kind capitalize on making the audience squirm in their seats, this film is a psychological thriller.<br /><br />While I won't spoil it for those who still wish to view this movie, the disappointing part for me was in the last 10 minutes of the movie.  I suppose someone didn't like the CGI graphics and thought that it looked too fake.  Well CGI has yet to look otherwise, but I didn't think it looked fake and believed that they did a great job with the design, sets, action, definitely the fear factor, and most certainly the remaining storyline up until the last part of the movie.<br /><br />It was so disappointing as if the writers simply didn't know how to end the movie so they put together something last minute, stuck some gum on it, and sent it to final editing to get it produced for theaters.  It's just too bad because this film deserved so much better.<br /><br />Otherwise I would have given this a no brainer 5 star rating.

B0012EM5D8|5.0|This movie was nice for all ages.  It can help kids learn about bees and it's funny.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|Well I just saw this movie after having heard gazillions of times how good this movie is. I have to agree its one of those movies which gives you a warm feeling about being in love. However is the topic really love or infatuation here. The better name I think would be \\"Infatuation Actually \\" :)
006135323X|3.0|The topic of the book is one of the most intetesting issues, not to mention a  Nobel prize that was awarded to Professor Daniel Kahanmann for his thesis of the psycho-economic perspective that shape human beings decision making. However, the book seems to be too long, not to say boring, after reading  the first pages. Some advertising slogans analysis alongside with ilustrations could have turn this book into an interesting and enjoyable reading experience.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|This was the first HD DVD's I purchased when I got my HD player, and it is well worth it.  This series did an excellent job of bringing together footage from all corners of the earth in excruciatingly crystal clear detail that has been unmatched to this day.  I saw part of this broadcast on HD Discovery, and knew as soon as I could, I would get this.  Shot and formated in 1080i, workes great on my TV (which only does 1080i).  There are two versions of this series, the BBC and the Discovery channel versions, the diffenece being Sigorney Weaver narrates the Discovery version and there is different music during the show.  The footage is the same.  Either version you will be pleased with, I know I am excited to own this one.
B0014Z4OQG|5.0|One thing I've noticed about Cloverfield.  People either love it or hate it.  Few people are in the middle.<br /><br />When I saw Cloverfield in the theater, I was very impressed.  The \\"First person cam\\" approach to this movie really worked well depicting the disaster scenes -- they are very similar to so many real disaster video clips we all see on TV and the Internet these days.  They add to the realism and horror of the movie.<br /><br />The DVD extras show just how much hard work and technology went into making this movie.  I am convinced that I can no longer believe anything I see on video.  With enough money, green screen and computer graphics matting, anything can look real.  You'll be surpised at how much of the movie was shot on a sound stage and green screen.<br /><br />I hope there is a sequel, and that it lives up to this one.
1402581386|3.0|I got interested in these books after seeing the series on TV, so I bought both of the them. I barely got through the first book. I felt it just \\"drug on\\", with too much of Dexter's \\"thoughts\\" and very little action or humor. However, I almost enjoyed the second one and I think maybe I would have enjoyed book 1 more if I hadn't seen the TV series.<br /><br />Having said the above, I think Book 1 was a building block for Dearly Devoted Dexter book 2, which was funny,  more action packed and was quicker paced.
0307387178|4.0|I was very moved by this movie, and the book does highlight some of the things that were missed in the movie.  The only thing that really didn't interest me was what the author needed to add his two cents worth, when he was growing up.<br />About Chris, it broke my heart, that he really wanted to get back home and the little mistakes that were made prevented him from doing that.  What a heartache for his family.<br />I had a husband \\"disappear\\" and he died in 1987, so I believe I can relate to a \\"what-if\\" scenaro.
B000BGR0OM|4.0|Good buy for the number of songs..hear all your favorites...CD was in excellent condition and sound quality good too..
B000ULQV0W|4.0|I was a little disappointed that ALL of the songs on the movie were not on this CD.  Although, I love Eddie Vedder's voice and the music.  I thought all the music would have been on it.
0446672653|5.0|In this book, Dr. Weiss relates the tale of two patients whose paths have crossed in previous lives and his ethical dilema about what to do.
0452289963|5.0|The book is extremely helpful in my personal spiritual growth. It has a ring of truth to it that few books have, and resonates deeply with what I have found to be my own truths, in this long seeking journey. It has helped me become more focused, and helps answer question that I've not found answers to before. It fits with my spiritual growth; it doesn't challenge or presume to undermine.....and the author does not judge our unique journeys.
B00000IAU3|4.0|After hearing and immediately falling in love with Dido's second album, \\"Life for Rent\\", I decided to give her debut album a shot. (Over 1,000 reviews giving it high ratings didn't hurt either.)   The cd opens out with the smashing \\"Here with Me\\" that shows the power and strength that I love in Dido's \\"White Flag\\". The lyrics are simple, but it's so stirring, you won't be unmoved.   Dido then slides into dark and troubled waters with \\"Honestly OK\\", \\"My Lover's Gone\\", and \\"My Life\\", which are mainly just a few lines and lots of electronic instrumentals: not neccesarily a bad thing, but the songs turned out a little shallow and unfulfilling. Dido redeems herself with the title track ( not a dirty, flirty song as you might be expecting, but simply expounding on the \\"strive for excellece, not perfection\\" idea); and the smash hit, \\"Thank You\\". \\"All You Want\\" and \\"Isabel\\" aren't bad, but they seem to be lacking something - I wasn't hooked.    The whole album carries a dark and depressing undertone of heartache and loss, which gently pulls you in under into it's sweeping undertow and you feel it softly bearing you away to somewhere solitary and shadow-covered. But dear Dido, give us a chance to breath!   So the bottom line is, there are a few good songs on here and I don't regret buying it(After all, I got it for $1 used), but I enjoyed \\"Life For Rent\\" more. Her voice, songwriting skills, and mixing is more developed and mature than in \\"No Angel\\". I'd advise you to get both.
B000OZ2CZW|2.0|\\"Umbrella\\" is the only song on the whole album I liked because the rest sounded like utterly forgettable filler junk.  What happenned??  \\"Umbrella\\" is nice pop-rock tune that suited Rihanna's average voice well and made her sound better.  It's too bad her whole album wasn't written in mostly the same genre.
1400049628|5.0|I have grown up aware of the living dead, but always thought of them as silly or a joke. This book really opened my eyes to the real plague that is the living dead. It's not a matter of \\"if,\\" but \\"when\\" this plague will actually happen. Brooks goes into great detail cataloging all of the possible weapons, defenses, scenario's, etc. that will help to keep you alive. This book is no joke. It seriously discusses survival tactics for when the dead arise.   Solanum is a mysterious and nefarious virus that must be stopped. Why our government is doing nothing to research and stop the next outbreak is beyond me. Since we can't convince Congress to do anything about this upcoming threat, we must prepare for this Armageddon on our own!   Bar the windows, store plenty of supplies (food, weapons, and ammo-for the love of God!) and get ready for a brain-splattering good time!   Make sure that you have enough room for this survival book when the plague hits because you'll need it!
B0014Z4OQG|5.0|Normally I'm not the type of person who enjoys intense films (namely ones intended to scare), but at least in my case I believe Cloverfield was an exceptionally well-done monster movie which both surpassed my expectations and seemed to live up to its hype. The concept of the movie is very entertaining: low-budget camcorders and realistic characters applied to the circumstance of a gigantic spider-like creature having itself a less than casual stroll through NYC. Like many have already said, the way in which the movie was filmed was already used by The Blair Witch Project, but I was glad to see this method used on such a promising premise as Cloverfield has to offer. The shaky camera angles that nauseated a lot of viewers were no trouble for me, and were effective in getting me involved in the intensity and realistic portions of the movie. Unlike the scary movies I've seen and despised in the past, Cloverfield took no cheap shots at my sensitiveness to intense films and thankfully was not full of jump moments or excessively gory. Instead it was oriented around heart-pounding scenes of action and a spontaneous plotline which kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time since I was completely unsure of how the movie would end. As it turned out, the ending was very satisfying in spite of the tragedy of it. I felt very attached to the characters and compelled by the action throughout the film, and when I stepped out of the theater I had a rather unsettling feeling of \\"whoa\\" (but in a good way). There's really no way to describe it with absolute accuracy for those who haven't seen it, so if you have not yet watched this movie I highly recommend it. It's by far my favorite movie of the year thus far. I went and saw it twice in the theater, and unfortunately the DVD release probably can't compare to the bigscreen atmosphere but it's still great to watch at home. I'd rate this five of five stars, and I don't commonly rate movies that high.
B000005IZ8|5.0|I'll admit straight out that I haven't seen the third film in the \\"Qatsi\\" series nor have I heard much of its accompanying music, which features the exceptional Yo-Yo Ma.  Regardless, I could still say that the score for \\"Powaqqatsi\\" easily tops the other two for no other reason than the emotional depth which \\"Powaqqatsi\\" explores.  There is triumph in the music, there is celebration, there is majesty, but underneath these moments of great achievement lies something foreboding, ominous, and insatiable.  The opening \\"Serra Pelada\\" is a dancing, parading embellishment straight through the heart of Brazil; the interspersed \\"Anthems\\" serve as reminders of toil and accomplishment; and the closing of \\"Mr Suso\\" and \\"From Egypt\\" are not only calls to prayer but calls to personal reflection before Glass recycles the \\"Anthem\\" motif one last time.<br /><br />This is an amazing work which feels and listens like anything other than a film score.  Glass has written many film scores since \\"Powaqqatsi,\\" including the spectacular \\"The Hours\\" and \\"The Illusionist,\\" but nothing sounds nearly so seamless nor so original as this.  You don't even have to see the film to enjoy the music or understand its relevancy and meaning.  I admire nearly all of Philip Glass' repetoire, yet \\"Powaqqatsi\\" remains for me one of his quintessential pieces, toppling even such classics like \\"Glassworks,\\" \\"Music in Twelve Parts,\\" and even the wonderful \\"Koyaanisqatsi\\" score.

0307277887|3.0|I'm new to Dexter only recently discovering it on CBS as they started out with season one.  I purchased this book in high hopes of the typical book to movie experience.  That being that you get a lot more detail out of the book and often times a better story.  This book surprised me in that it is EXACTLY like the show.  I love the show and was excited to find out that it was based on a novel.  \\"Based on\\" is not true enough of a phrase.  This show exactly details the book.  I hope the show didn't spend much money bringing in a writer to convert the book to a script.  Don't get me wrong... I think this is a good read if you haven't seen the show, but otherwise it is a waste of time.
B000H6SXLU|4.0|\\"Roberta\\", the third film in the Astaire/Rogers canon, was released in 1935 as their stars were still rising. The film was based on a successful Broadway musical. In 1935, Irene Dunne was a big movie name so she had the lead. Hindsight makes us regret that Astaire and Rogers are not the primary focus but it made sense when the film was released. While Randolph Scott is merely adequate as the football hero paired with Dunne, the film has many highlights:    - \\"Let's Begin\\" is a terrific novelty number with Astaire paired with 2 comic dancers  - \\"Smoke gets in your Eyes\\", a number still recorded today, is sung by Dunne in her cool soprano. Dunne was a first rate actress and she uses her acting skills to interpret the song superbly.  - both Astaire and Rogers have some excellent comic bits and they shine with the dialogue.  - the fashion show is lugubrious but a very blonde and statuesque Lucille Ball can be glimpsed among the mannequins.  - Rogers dancing shows a distinct improvement from her previous films and she is fluid and sexy.    The print of the film is excellent and there are a few extras. The short film is a technicolour opus set at a resort with many stars appearing between mainly mediocre and boring musical acts. Marketing, 1935 style, comes from a radio program which promotes the film's Jerome Kern songs and the theatrical trailer. A cartoon is included too.    This is one of the least interesting DVDs in the Astaire/Rogers collections and best value if purchased as part of one of them.
B00005JPXY|1.0|I would give this movie 0 if i can, but i give it 1 for special effect effort. I cannot keep up with the movie because i have to look away everytime the movie shaking. It's really really annoying. This has spoiled entire movie... So summarize what i HATE about this movie:   - I dont know if movie makers ever think of putting themselve into a dangerous situation but still filming.   - A movie without content except the city was attacked by monster and people were running around seeking places to hide  - Main characters are idiot folks  - Special effect, well, is far worse than Gorilla  - Movie is too short    So recommendation:  - If you just want a movie about monster, maybe it's for you.  - If you want to get dizzy and vommit on your popcorn, hola, you get one.
B0001MDQ6W|4.0|This is the famous \\"Unplugged\\" concert recorded for MTV in 1994. Of course all Dylan fans should have this DVD, for others a few comments:<br />(1) Dylan often rethinks his songs in concert so the version of a song such as \\"Love Minus Zero/No Limit\\" is quite different to what was recorded in the studio - this is neither a good or bad thing - just something to be aware of.<br />(2) Also when people say Dylan was in \\"good voice\\" here, the initiated may not be so convinced. Again Dylan live - especially in his later years - is a somewhat acquired taste.<br />(3) The song select could have been better. There are so many other songs I would rather have here, but obviously this is a matter of personal taste.
B00003CX9E|5.0|Oh how the times have changed.<br /><br />A film that was in all actuality a box-office flop; critically panned and literally booed at the 14th annual Oscars; a film that received nine Oscar nominations yet only received one statuette (for screenplay) rises from the ashes of a pummeling demise to become considered the greatest American film of all time.  All too often this is the case; a film is either critically lauded or distained only to, with time, change the minds of the American public.  `Citizen Kane' rests comfortable at the top (the number one position) of AFI's list of the top 100 films ever made, and I don't see it dropping positions anytime soon (unless `The Godfather' sneaks in).  Personally, I feel that America got this right; the second time.<br /><br />While I personally prefer Coppola's `gangster' masterpiece I feel that `Citizen Kane' is a marvelous example of perfected cinema, an entertaining and enlightening film that stands the test of time and in all actuality gets better as the years roll by.<br /><br />The film opens the fragile whisper of the word \\"Rosebud\\" before it explodes with the exclamation of newspaper tycoon Charles Foster Kane's death.  The film revolves around a news reporter trying to uncover the meaning behind Kane's last word, \\"Rosebud\\".  What that reporter finds though is that no man's life can be summed up with one word.<br /><br />I find that revelation to be supremely important and universally reaching.  The whole of `Citizen Kane' can be summed up in the realization that no man can be fully understood without fully understanding where he came from, what he strived for and ultimately what he became.  As this reporter interviews those closest to Kane, those who loved and or hated him, he (as well as we) gets a beautifully well rounded and complete picture of the man that was Charles Foster Kane.  We get an inside look at his professional life as well as his personal life; his friends, his wives, his business partners.  We get to see how Kane interacted with others, how he dealt with those close to him and even those who peered down at him with evil intent; but as the film draws to its close we realize that the one thing we never got to see is the one missing link to fully grasping `who' Charles Foster Kane really was.<br /><br />That is his `rosebud'.<br /><br />Sure, `Citizen Kane', in the process of exposing this man, delves into the politics of corruption and greed, wealth and power, but it's the underlying message that floats to the surface and becomes the true root of the film.  When one walks away from this film he is left with a reflective work of deep meaning and everlasting presence; a universal message that touches the foundations of humanity and dwells eternally in the bowels of those privileged to witness this masterpiece.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed about `Citizen Kane' was its visual styling.  This is a film that feels up-to-date all the way around.  I'm fully convinced that this film could be released this year and it would hold up strongly against the world of modern cinema.  You know how some films feel dated?  `Citizen Kane' is not that film.<br /><br />Another facet of `Citizen Kane' that is stellar beyond compare is that of the acting, especially on the part of the films writer, director and star Orson Welles.  Welles is charismatic, natural and convincing.  He gives a masterfully well rounded and committed performance that stands tall as one of the finest male performances of all time.  Seriously, how he lost the acting Oscar is beyond me.  How this movie lost any of the Oscars it was snubbed for; Best Actor, Best Director, Best Picture, Score, Film Editing, Cinematography, Art Direction and Sound Recording; is beyond me.  At least it was honored with the Screenplay Oscar, but still, that's such a token award for such a marvelous film.<br /><br />`Citizen Kane' is lauded as one of the greatest, as the greatest even, and I have to jump on that bandwagon andlet my voice be heard.  This is a revelation, an iconic piece of cinema that is sure to prove supremely entertaining and rewarding to the viewer.  The film is paced beautifully, never loses the audience's attention or appreciation and, as I mentioned, just gets better and better every time you watch it.  Orson Welles had a vision, a marvelous vision at that, and while it was not fully understood or appreciated upon its release, he can `rest in peace' now, fully aware that his vision will never be forgotten.inema that is sure to prove supremely entertaining and rewarding to the viewer.

B000TGCR38|3.0|This well-produced Dutch film traces the experiences of a young Dutch-Jewish woman in German-occupied Holland in the final stages of WWII. With Paul Verhoeven at the helm you know you are there are going to be some unusual touches and fans will not be disappointed - the film has fetishistic love scenes, cartoonish action, and numerous plot inconsistencies and ambiguities. Although long the film is never boring. The acting is excellent, particulary by the leads Carice van Houten and Sebastian Koch. What really detracts from the impact of this film is an illogical plot development surrounding Koch's character at the end of the film from which is never quite recovers. Nevertheless this film provides yet another interesting perspective on WWII.<br /><br />As usual Verhoeven provides a tremendously frank and entertaining \\"director's commentary\\".
0439882826|5.0|I was floored when we opened this book! I have never seen such an intelligent way of creating a pop-up book in my life!  There are sooo many pop-ups with excellent descriptions and at the end, real light-up lightsabers of two main characters.  Unbelievable and worth the money!!
1401359418|5.0|Having read the reviews and recently only having read the book myself, one cannot help but think that this book is a good thing. It is light reading, anecdotal and not full of all the psycho nonsense and political correctness we seem to have forced down our throats these days. To the wingers out there, of course, there is always room for further experimentation when it comes to scientific research, this is only one perspective. This is a positive book, having a good attitude can only help in times of adversity and it appeals to all people from all walks of life to lighten up and look at life in a more positive (but not dillusional) light. So what if it doesn't meet some people's scientific elitism. It satisfied me because it was direct and simple and full of common sense - something that isn't common these days.
0385522401|5.0|Ian McEwan is a brilliant writer who creates an intimate portrait of a newly-wed couple who are both vigins.  Facing the first night of their honeymoon, the author allows the reader an insightful view of Florence's fears and Edward's hopes.  What follows is sad especially when you realize that the right word at a particular moment could change all that happens.
6305907145|3.0|While the movie was entertaining...it just wasn't what Jane Austen wrote. Fanny Price was much more headstrong and outspoken in this version than in the book. She wasn't like any of the characters in any of Austen's books. I think I would have enjoyed this movie more if it wasn't called Mansfield Park. I couldn't help but comparing the two, and, thus, was disappointed. However, on it's own merit, it was an entertaining movie. By Austen standards, it just didn't make the mark.
B00169N0BK|2.0|I really wanted this to work. Unfortunately the prints looked terrible. I am giving it two stars because Amazon made the return process so easy and the product was easy to use<br /><br />First, my equipment is an Apple Imac 24, Mac OS 10.4.11. I used the auto monitor calibration and did not see much change, but that wasn't too surprising as I had already calibrated the monitor. I really wanted to do the printer calibration. I have two Epson Photo printers; a 2200 and a 3800. I can get good prints out of them (fantastic prints out of the 3800) but they often don't look exactly like whats on the screen. That was my goal, having a close a match to my screen appearance as to the print. Wasn't even close.<br /><br />I redid the calibration several times, on both printers and for me, on my system, it did not work. I have read other reviews where they had great luck, but in may case it didn't work.<br /><br />Amazon was fine about the return and even paid for the return shipping via uPS ground, the Amazon experience was excellent, and the ColorMunki was very easy to use but the printed output was terrible.
B000Z27HLS|4.0|I really enjoyed this version of the Austen classic. It was funny and romantic, much as Austen wrote it. The actors made the characters jump right out of the pages of this story.
B000Y179KO|5.0|I was initially reluctant to purchase this new album, loving the old Eagles' albums so much.  But I am extremely pleased with their new work.  It retains the interesting instrumentals and gorgeous vocal harmonies of the earlier works, but with more mature and socially-conscious, even political, content.  The Long Road Out of Eden track is stunning, both for its use of middle eastern instruments and melodies and for its thoughtful lyrics.  The following instrumental track, I dreamed there was no war, was profoundly moving for the lushness of the instrumentation; it is a perfect complement to the earlier Long Road track.  Other offerings are similarly reminiscent of the young Eagles, but, to me, much more interesting in terms of lyrics and equally enjoyable for the variety and musicality that I expected of this group.  I could not be more pleased.
B000MTPANQ|4.0|I've been a major Neil Young fan since the first Buffalo Springfield album, & I must say that upon viewing this concert dvd, I have just a few comments-if you've been a Neil fan for a long time, you will absoulutely love this-it is precious.  It's so good hearing him hitting the high notes as clear as he did on the original albums. Not only the live performance, but the 'home-movie' extras, which give us a bit of an idea of what Neil is/was really like offstage.  But...what in the world is the deal with the showing of a reel-to-reel tape recorder for several minutes of some songs, & in a few cases, the entire song instead of Neil himself performing??  Did whoever put this out think that anyone on earth would rather watch a recorder on Neil's chair instead of him??  Thus the 4 instead of 5 stars. Otherwise, this is a true Neil Young fan's dream dvd-I hope they release more live shows from this period, & especially earlier..maybe some Buffalo Springfield, or even an early concert during his 1st two solo album tours, hopefully with this same quality, which is perfect.
B00154GEFU|5.0|If you took ASIA, Alpha and Astra (Even though Howe wasn't apart of this I hear some similarities in Downes' Keyboards from this CD), throw in some ICON and you have PHOENIX!!!!! I loved the Payne era Asia and I remember when 'Silent Nation' came out and they said it was their attempt to recapture the feel of the debut. I just couldn't understand why they would say that. It was nothing like that IMO. This CD captures everything from those past CDs and brings it into the current decade. There just isn't a bad song on here and to pick a favorite would be hard. This CD gets me excited about music again!! It is that good!!!
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Extraordinaire is a word that does not do justice to this series.  It's obvious that the series took years to complete.  There is just so much information, visual and audio, and such beauty and awe within that I'll be rewatching this series for the rest of my life and expect to learn something new each time I do.      I just bought my blu-ray player and decided that I would buy at least one or two blu-ray discs, after which I'll just rent them from Netflix. I'm one who doesn't want to watch movies again after seeing them unless it's years and years later.  I must say that I made the PERFECT choice in buying Planet Earth.  And trust me, people, \\"perfect\\" is a word I typically only associate with God.  And it's so apropos in this instance. My exclamations have incessantly been \\"Oh my God!!!\\"  Do yourselves a favor, folks, and get this for your family and friends.  I want to share it with everyone.  Thanks Mr. Attenborough.

B00005JNBQ|5.0|This movie makes me roll on the floor laughing.  Growing up in Idaho and western Colorado, I have known kids like Napoleon; kids who don't quite fit in and have no desire to.  Having moved several times in junior high and high school, I have been there!      Unless you have lived in a small town or understand it's social structure and hierarchy, you will not 'get' this film.  This film is not a commentary on American culture, nor is it an art film destined for greatness.  Take this film for what it is:  a quirky comedy about small town life stuck in a time warp; a town ignored by the rest of society, just like Napoleon.
0634049011|5.0|Since 1969 when I first started learning guitar, I have accumulated (count 'em!) about four feet of instructional books.    Despite hours of pouring over this stack, I STILL didn't have a sense for the fretboard.  Most of what I play are chords to sing along with and a few pieces I have memorized.    I'm on vacation studying Tagliarino's book and in a few days feel like I FINALLY have a sense for the fretboard.  It is rare to find a great teacher, and even rarer to find a book that is thought out to meet the needs of the learner.       This book presents in an orderly manner that gives one a sense for patterns inherent in the fretboard a stepwise approach to learning the fretboard.  There are multiple 'homework' assignments with an answer key in the back.  Tagliarino's suggestions for practice are also exactly what I have wanted for years.    So, add this 5 star review to the chorus.   As far as I am concerned, if it isn't already, add this book to the classics of instructional classics
B00009NHC5|4.0|She is one of the few actors/actresses who portray a realistic blind person. If Al Pacino saw this movie, he could had played a better character in \\"Scent of a Woman\\".      The plot/story of this movie is even better.  A blind woman defending herself alone against three hoods, where one of them, slowing becomes a highly strung psychopath.  This movie has elements of the real world: living with blindness, drug trafficing, the relationships between sight and non-sighted people, how a bad person can have a conscience, and death.    This movie is what I called a mordern suspense, crime, thriller of the 1960s'.  This is the movie Audrey Hepburn was nominated for an Oscar.
0810994739|5.0|Do you have a reluctant reader? I can't recommend this book series enough for typical elementary age boys! I've never seen my 10 year old with his nose actually in a book, but this series did it. Jeff Kinney is a genius, and I'm grateful for his writing efforts. We can't wait for book 3, book 4, and so on! This is the first book series that my 4th grader actually read on his own. In his words, \\"I think these are funny, hilarious, and filled with great characters.\\" Take a chance on these and chances are, you won't be sorry!
0307387178|4.0|This incredible story really needs to be read in conjunction with \\"Let's roll!\\" [ordinary people, extraordinary courage] / Lisa Beamer with Ken Abraham.  No two people are the same for we are all unique individuals.  But both of these stories involve very bright people, surrounded by very supportive friends and systems.  Both of the main characters and people around them came face to face with incredible tragedy. Some chose to rely on philosophy.  Some became stronger and some went into a destructible tailspin. In my opinion, these two fantastic books illustrate that it all comes down to faith, character and personal choices.
B000WCDI64|5.0|Amy Winehouse shows in this luscious DVD that she is the real deal. The best singer/songwriter to come along in ages, and a charming, beautiful performer. What more could one ask? She did NOT appear \\"drunk\\" to me--just a bit shy, insecure, and pleasantly tipsy. Whatever gets you though the show, Amy! She's got the \\"wow factor\\" so many manufactured, lip syncing, cookie cutter pop stars lack. This doll has talent to spare. And her band is the bomb. As for the two back-up singers/dancers--phenomenal! Where do these guys find the energy to sing and dance like that for an entire show? This DVD showcases a rare talent--so ignore the tabloid trash and enjoy a genuine star for a change.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I love Jillian! She really knows how to get you to work hard and lose weight.
B00005JPTK|4.0|Great movie. Weird that extras are downloadable in this DVD set, so you need a PC to see them. If you have a BR player, just get the Blu-Ray version so you won't need a PC to see everything.
B00009ATIX|4.0|Although this film compares unfavorably to the Tarkovsky version (not much wouldn't), I was pleasantly surprised with Soderbergh's rendition of Lem's novel.    The technical concerns of this film are all but flawless.  The set design is perfect - futuristic but minimalist and believable so as to keep the viewer focused on the plot rather than the flashy effects.  The editing, directing, cinematography, and script are all top-notch, and although Soderbergh chose to tell the tale of Kelvin and Rhea's romance through the rather hackneyed technique of flashbacks, he tied the segments to each character's memories in such a way as make each flashback seamless and keep the plot moving forward.  All of the romantic scenes are well done - intensely emotional and almost never cheesy or overly sentimental.    One of the main things tying everything together in this film is the phenomenal music by Cliff Martinez.  The subtle, synth and string-filled orchestrations are one part Romantic classical music, four parts experimental ambient, and each time Martinez's themes resurface, the viewer is immediately filled with the same sense of yearning experienced by the character of Chris Kelvin.  Unfortunately the CD of this score is out of print, but luckily it is still available on Itunes.  (For another great sci-fi film whose music connects its disparate plot lines, check out Aronofsky's \\"The Fountain.\\")    My small complaints with this version of the film are these:  Although Clooney pulls off his role expertly, I didn't care for the supporting players in this film.  Ulrich Tukur's character is perfectly nuanced and tragic, but Viola Davis is too stiff, McElhone delivers her lines poorly (though she does have an incredible screen presence), and Jeremy Davies attempts to bring some oddball light humor to a film that didn't really need any.  (Am I the only one who is annoyed when a great, serious film is interrupted by some jackass failing to act funny?  Not every film requires comic relief, people.)    In addition to that quibble, the ending, though shot gorgeously, is a bit convoluted, and though it seems to be hinting at the sublime mystery reached at the end of Tarkovsky's original, this film's ending doesn't quite hack it.    It's a shame, though, that Soderbergh's take on Solaris was perceived as a failure simply because it was marketed (and perhaps cast) poorly.  As Soderbergh mentions in some of the DVD extras, it hearkens back to the sci-fi films of the 50's and 60's, which remembered to include real human drama amongst all the glitzy space travel and laser beams.
B000002O4S|4.0|I have Sylvestri's score which is wonderful, but I was missing Marvin Berry's Earth Angel and Night Train from the Enchantment Under the Sea Dance.  How fun it is to have them now.
B00133MKVK|5.0|The CD is a great mix of traditional and current material from a diva that has aged with grace.  If you liked her previous work, you need to get this one.
0743424425|5.0|The Shining was Stephen King's third published novel and tells the story of Jack Torrance and his family after Jack takes a job as winter caretaker at the Overlook Hotel. We quickly learn that Jack has a history of losing his temper and getting into trouble and the caretaker's job is something of a last chance for him to rebuild his life. His wife, Wendy, and son, Danny, are the only other people in the hotel for the winter... the only other living people that is. Some unpleasant spirits also populates the Overlook and they've decided that they want the Torrance's to join their club. I don't want to give away any more of the plot for those few who have never seen the movie or read the book, but suffice to say that the family faces quite a struggle to survive their time at the hotel.     I often enjoy Stephen King's books but I also don't find many of them to be particularly scary. More often, they are compelling character studies with a bit of suspense. Not so, The Shining. This is a genuine horror story and provides plenty of white-knuckle moments as you read through it. The character development is still there, but the suspense is more intense and prolonged than we usually get from King.     While a good deal of the story centers on Jack, his son Danny is the counterbalance that makes the book work so well. He has a remarkable gift (called the shining) that allows him to see glimpses of the future as well as sense the thoughts of those around him. But at five years old, he is far too young to wield his power effectively against the hotel and he can't bear to accept what his visions show him about his father. As his father descends into madness and the ghosts get more aggressive, the odds grow increasingly long against Danny's survival.     The Shining is an easy book to recommend. It has remained one of Stephen King's most popular books ever since it was published 30 years ago for good reason. It's one of his best efforts and has a more timeless quality than mostof his works. If you're looking for a good scare, give it a try.
1401322336|5.0|I never expect that this book would be so big, it is heavy, but it covers everything  you can know about kitchen and cooking. Great book!
B0001YRVN4|4.0|DVDs I would have given a 5 star rating but I had to take one of the disks in to a game place and have it polished.  I was overlooked by one of the inspectors.  I could have sent it back, but went to the other route first.  I still was impressed by the price and quality of the product, afterall they were used..Thanks
B000ICL3CO|4.0|I love the Cure. The things this music does to me... well, you just have no idea. And this album is no different, the music shines. Even if there are some tracks that don't feel fully realized.<br />It is a very eclectic mix, I'll admit. And that is my one major complaint with this album. It just kinda goes all over the place with no real flow from one song to the next.<br />Albums like \\"Disintegration\\" and 'Wish\\", for example have an excellent flow. With every song leading into the next beautifully. These albums are so easy to turn on and just get lost in them.<br />\\"Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me\\" feels more like it was thrown together, with no particular song order in mind. And while I like all the songs, the structure of the album makes it hard to get lost in the music.<br />It pains me to give the Cure less than five stars, but this album just isn't perfect. Really good, but not perfect.
B000XUUQQK|4.0|Boogeyman 2 is one of those rare sequels that is better than the original film. Granted, that's not saying much. The original Boogeyman was a rather bland spook-fest about a supernatural Boogeyman that lived in children's closets. Boogeyman 2 is as different from the original as Halloween 3: Season of the Witch was different from the other entries in that series. Now I'm going to do something that I've never done before in one of my DVD reviews and give readers a spoiler alert. I'm doing so because I think it's necessary to totally separate Boogeyman 2 from its predecessor.<br /><br />Two children, Henry and younger sister Laura, are traumatized when they see their parents murdered. Ten years later, Henry is leaving a mental hospital, apparently cured of his phobia of the dark and ready to move on with his life. However, his sister is still terrified of the Boogeyman and decides to voluntarily check into the same facility that treated her brother. There she meets a group of patients, all coping with various phobias such as bulimic Nicky who fears gaining weight, germophobe Paul, agoraphobic Darren, and Alison whose condition causes her to cut herself. The group is all under the care of Dr. Allen, played by Saw veteran Tobin Bell, and his assistant Dr. Jessica Ryan. Ryan is played by Renee O' Connor who is best known for her role As Gabrielle in Xena: Warrior Princess.<br /><br />Soon after Laura arrives, patients start to die. Laura is convinced that the Boogeyman has followed her to the hospital but Dr. Allen insists it's there is no Boogeyman and it's just her fear that she has to face. Boogeyman 2 has only the most tenuous tie to the first film as we learn that the main character was also treated by Dr. Allen. Now, here's the little spoiler alert and I think astute horror fans will figure this out very early on...<br /><br />This is not a supernatural tale like the first one but a good ol' fashioned slasher that is far more effective in its execution than the recent, over-hyped Hatchet.  Director Jeff Betancourt has succeeded in giving fans an 80's-style slasher film with a young, good looking cast, trapped in a creepy hospital, and stalked by a killer. The kills are gory, yet stylishly conceived and original. Each of the patients meets their end in a way that befits their particular fears.<br /><br />Danielle Savre is quite good in her performance as Laura. She's the requisite horror film heroine, terrified yet resourceful enough to stay alive. Tobin Bell only seems to have one expression no matter what role he's playing but he does bring a certain sinister quality to the film.<br /><br />The effects and gore are very well done, far better than one would expect from a direct-to-DVD sequel. While his was Betancourt's first directorial effort, he's not stranger to horror films, having worked as editor on The Grudge, The Grudge 2, When a Stranger Calls, and The Exorcism of Emily Rose.  He's learned his craft well. The scenery was dark, but not so dark that you could not see what was happening onscreen.<br /><br />Now, it's not all perfect. The film stretches the limits of logic quite a bit. We are to believe that this large facility is staffed by only two doctors and one nurse. There's no security, no maintenance, and the only orderly is fired near the beginning of the film. The doors are controlled through the phone system and when the phones go down, everyone is trapped inside. Somehow I'm thinking that a lack of emergency exits would not be up to building and fire safety codes. So yes, the film does ask the viewer to suspend a bit of belief. If you can do that, this turns out to be one gem of a slasher!Director Jeff Betancourt has succeeded in giving fans an 80's-style slasher film with a young, good looking cast, trapped in a creepy hospital, and stalked by a killer.

B000YABYLA|5.0|What a great movie. Excellent story and fantastic acting. Does not promote teenage pregnancy but deals with it in a loving and practical way.  Ellen Page is amazing.  Loved this and will watch it over and over.
B000W7JWUA|3.0|I bought the 3rd edition of Settlers and the expansion for our game group about a year ago.  I recently purchased the new versions including Seafarers and Cities & Knights, excited about the artwork and frame pieces, but I was extremely disappointed.    Some changes:   1) The new SLAP YOU IN THE FACE blue water pieces' color do not match our original version.  This makes it impossible to mix with our older games for our large groups.      2) The new \\"white\\" pieces are actually painted white now which I think is an improvement, but now they don't match earlier versions of the game.     3) The hexes are (incredibly) even flimsier than the 3rd edition.  They are also coated with a very glossy surface coating that makes it hard to play with light coming in the windows.       4) The snap-together edges seem like an improvement, but since I have one of those awesome wooden boards from eBay, we don't use them.     5) The clay hexes, that used to be clearly red, are now so similar in color to the wheat hexes that it's harder to differentiate between them.       6) Gold, wheat, and even desert look very similar as well, but the cards' backgrounds haven't changed to help you match the resource with the card.  With the exception of forest, the new hex artwork actually makes the game harder to play, imo.    Catan is still a fantastic game and our game groups' favorite.  But I am so disappointed with the new version that I am very seriously considering selling my 4th edition to go back to the easier to play with older versions.
B00003CXDD|5.0|This is a great movie with all the elements of fantasy ...and that includes Val Kilmer.   Good for all ages but it is a bit scary sometimes.
B0011HF6GE|5.0|As a debut album, this is one of the good ones. It is  without a doubt, one of the best albums(CD's but pretentious) of 2008. It clearly encompasses a personal sadness without overly blunt lyrics, and with beautiful tunes that make puppy dogs weep. It's very much on the quiet side, but some of the tracks (For Emma) use volume to highlight their vibrant nature, or to strengthen impact(Skinny Love). I know this sounds a little artsy, but trust me, this music is great, enjoyable, sad, stirring, and a sure sign of more good music to come. If you don't know who Bon Iver is, don't worry. This music will make you a fan.
B000PKG7I4|5.0|I'm addicted to this album...no pun intended...ok, maybe intended.  What a creative awesome mind. She's got the Shirley Bassey beat and voice with a modern vibe. I can't stop listening...it's my new fave
B00005JLEU|5.0|Absolutely one of my daughters favorite movies! This is the second time I've purchased it - she lost the 1st one. Great movie.
B00000DI06|5.0|This is a wonderfully nuanced & beautiful recording of this work.  I don't understand why no one mentions the Lux Aeterna -- Donna Deam's rendering of the solo sounds purely angelic.
B00004WG2F|3.0|**Spoilers**    Ugh!  Husband found this in the bargain bin at the supermarket and said,  \\"Oh!  This is such a great movie!\\" He's pretty picky about movies, not  liking chick flicks and those of that ilk. So I thought, \\"Hey! Why not  watch it!\\" What tragedy. Some reviewers here complain that it's  unrealistic. No, it's realistic alright. The classic \\"Nice Guys Don't  Get Laid\\" by Marcus P. Meleton. The bad guy, the one who steals other  men's women, gets the slut who sleeps with every single brother, and  has the nerve to tell her future husband, \\"It was Samuel I loved.\\"  Yeah, right.    And then, the prodigal son goes on to become a bootlegger, and I guess  most Brad Pitt fans and anti-establishment people are supposed to feel  sorry for him, because he put his wife and kids in jeopardy with his  illegal activities. This kind of selfishness happens in real life all  the time.    The oldest son, who truly cares about helping his community grow, and  who loves a woman so much, he's willing to take secondhand, nay  *third*hand goods, ends up marrying a woman who is such a weenie that  she'd kill herself for a man who doesn't even love her, in some kind of  pitiful Sylvia Plath-like angst.    Augh! All too realistic and demonstrative of the melodrama of people  with certain psychiatric disorders.    3 stars out of 5, rather than zero, because although it was irritating as  heck, it is a true tragedy that I see time and time again in real life.
B0014Z4OQG|3.0|Preparations are under way for a farewell bash for Rob (Michael Stahl-David), who, in an undoubted nod to \\"Godzilla,\\" is leaving for a job in Japan. Before he arrives, Rob's brother Jason (Mike Vogel) records video testimonials from assorted guests, including party babe Lily (Jessica Lucas) and guarded semi-acquaintance Marlena (Lizzy Caplan).<br /><br />Snippets of conversation reveal Rob has never again contacted Beth (Odette Yustman), the girl from the opening scene, who summarily shows up with another guy -- much to Rob's distress. Just as the emotional steam from this conflict is ready to blow, all hell breaks loose outside and, after viewing the initial devastation from the roof, the hipsters put the party on hold in favor of saving their skins.<br /><br />This early action, as the group joins the panicking, confused and injured hordes on the dark streets, where the head of the Statue of Liberty has been unceremoniously dumped, is the best stuff in the picture; something dreadful is out there, but neither we nor the characters have a clue what it is until one of the characters exclaims, \\"I saw it. It's alive!\\" Rob, Lily, Marlena and Hud (T.J. Miller), now manning the camera, head for the Brooklyn Bridge, which the beast upends in spectacular fashion while showing a bit of its lizardly monstrousness in the process.<br /><br />Rob then insists they head uptown to try to save Beth, presumed to be in the high-rise building from the opening scene; Odysseus had an easy time of it compared to what these unprepossessing non-warrior types go through to reach their destination.<br /><br />Finding Beth with a piece of rebar sticking through her, they manage to all run to army helicopters to escape but do they?<br /><br />The movie works but comes with a guaranteed headache.
B00000JCB2|5.0|this was great alot better than their corney first album. This album was great from start to finish better lyrics no corney garbage ones i have all their albums and this and their third and fourth were great but this was great a great CD from LB.
B000REYUKU|5.0|Frankly, I've yet to use this item.  Though I can say that the reviews by others of this item the E4 and the E3, say's all that need be said.  It's as light weight as possible which is a good thing in a battery pack and the hook up is easy and off course the all important interface is suitable with all my Canon speedlights and cameras.  Really there's not much about it not to like other then the price.  Which no doubt ought to be cut by at least half or two thirds, which I'm sure will happen with time.  I purchased the pack for shooting at events after dark.  Often one must be very quick during events to get shots which are any good at all. Unless you were to flood large areas with light what hope is there of getting any usable shots at all, otherwise.  This battery pack will give me that extra needed speed at night events to get good shots. ~~~~~~ Addendum: I finally got around to testing out this battery pack, and it's perfectly functional and suites my purposes. ~~ As for using it, if at all possible I try and not use flashes.  As of yet I've not had to use it on a job, but no doubt there will come a time when I'll have no other choice if I want to get the shots I need.  And, I'll be prepared... ~~~ Good luck.
0767830555|4.0|It was easy to see that Robert Deniro was going to be an amazing actor from this film.  I caught most of his movies from the 80's and 90's so he was a seasoned actor by then.  In Taxi Driver you could see the rawness and hunger in him.  Loved it.
B0000E1ALR|5.0|This is the ultimate collection of songs from Springsteen. Takes you from his early roots to his newer material. 3rd disk is some obscure songs from his duet and blues ventures, very good. Couple this with his new release 'Magic', and you are set. Just saw Bruce in concert in Indy, and playing  this collection now revisits that night, which was special seeing Danny with a surprise 3 song performance that turned out to be his last. Highly recommend!
0307265730|3.0|From the first few words of Jhumpa's stunning first story, you know you are reading her.....the style is simple but very much hers.   I particularly loved the title story, and feel its her best yet.  On the whole I liked this better than \\"Interpreter...\\"  I agree with one of the other reviewers however. As an Indian who moved here in the 90s, I'm stuck between the two generations of Indians (always refered to as Bengalis in her book...Bengalis happen to be from India but are known for a slight strain of chauvinsim, shall we say) she describes.  I've adopted most of the ways of people who live here and still have ties to my home in India.  I still can relate to their stories however.  I just wish she would depart every once in a while and populate her stories with people who are  slightly different.  Maybe Indians with Blue Collar jobs or Gay Indians or whatever else.  Jhumpa, you've lived here long enough to have been touched by people who didn't go to Harvard or Columbia, didn't grow up in affluent Boston suburbs and don't have perfect careers (but silent personal struggles)...  Its like I'm hearing variations of the same (albeit beautiful) song over and over again.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|This is balm to my soul. I listen to it when I need soothing from this hectic, chaotic world/life. It is contagious. First my daughter then my difficult, very hard to please son-in-law began to listen to Celtic Woman. I have become a collector of this wonderful music and share it with those I know and love. After feeling so moved by this music, I researched and found I have Celtic roots, somehow I'm not surprised.
B000021Y7X|4.0|I wish someone could have filmed a performance from the Remain in Light tour, which was much stronger than the Stop Making Sense tour. The latter does lend itself well to filmed performance, and this is a great film nonetheless. I saw both tours, and the energy and songs on the Remain in Light tour were far better.
0345479092|5.0|I read this book when my first born was 3 months old and wished I would have read it while pregnant instead of all those pregnancy books.  Anyway, it's WONDERFUL advice, and I now buy it for every first time parents I know!  (Ordering it for my cousin even 5 years later now.)  Taking care of a newborn is tough!  This book gives you some insight and definitely helps you enjoy your sweet new baby!  Good luck.
0060763280|5.0|I absolutely loved this book!  If you want to better yourself and or your financial standings this is a must read.  The information is priceless.
0452289963|5.0|Good book, arrived in good shape in god time. Will buy from this seller again
B000TGCR38|5.0|The other reviewers have covered the plot and story line well, so I won't go into that. I'll just say that like in real life (it was based on a true story) things are not always like they seem. By the time you think you have the characters figured out, they will throw you for a loop. Who's good and who's bad? This one will keep you guessing and glued to the screen.<br /><br />Carice van Houten is a beautiful, talented and very chrismatic actress. Carice and Sebastian Koch (who plays the Nazi officer who falls in love with her) have red hot chemistry on screen. It turns out that in real life they are in a paramour relationship. Koch's character is actually using his position as a Nazi officer to help the Dutch resistance, making him a sort of sympathetic character, as he finds his humanity.<br /><br />Yes, there is LOTS of nudity, violence and graphic love scenes. It's a war picture. I tend to be conservative where nudity, violence and S.E.X. are concerned, but I do believe it adds to the plot and the passionate moods that the film maker is trying to create.  Not many movies have me thinking about them for months after I watch, but this movie did!<br /><br />In closing, perhaps this film's very graphic portrayal of war isn't for everyone, but I thought it was great. The soundtrack was enjoyable too. By the way, Sebastian Koch was quite easy on my eyes. I'd love to see him and Carice van Houten star together again.
B000V7O0IA|1.0|We tried twice with this crappy Mexican DVD. They will NOT load and play. all others will!!
0316010669|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell did a great job explaining thin-slicing. His examples were very memorable and easy to connect with for the most part. I couldn't put this book down! I am going into education and find this book really interesting on how we can set up schema's and think so quickly. In this book I found out just how important our unconsciousness is. This book is great if you want to learn about how we have a reason for something but can't really explain it. It is also great if you are one of those people with a gut feeling and have no real reason for it. I would recommend this book to anyone. I want to read the tipping point I hope that it will be just as entertaining as blink!
B00127RAJY|5.0|It certainly makes me sweat. I'm already starting to see a difference in muscle tone.
B000V8I2QU|5.0|There, I said it.  I'd give it 10 stars if I could.<br /><br />Why is Bruce still, after 7 months on the magical \\"Magic\\" Tour, averaging 8 or 9 of this album's tunes a night?  Because he, and the band, and the audience, all know that these are some of the best songs he's ever written...ever.  For once, \\"the new stuff\\" makes everyone happy -- the players and the listeners.<br /><br />Buy this album, listen to it, and love it.  It's Springsteen's ultimate masterpiece.  That's all I have to say.
B00007G2FC|5.0|Judging by the great amount of reviews, it is obvious for me that, either loving it or hating it, this film does indeed \\"scar\\" (as David Fincher would put it) the viewer. The fact that some people couldn´t stand the agitated camera work or the extreme violence, doesn´t mean it is a bad film; such clasification is rather superficial, for the true value of a cinematic experience doesn´t rely on the lack (or for that matter, the amount) of violence. There are notable examples of great films, both with or without any violence, even within the body of work of a single director (take for instance David Lynch´s \\"Blue Velvet\\" and \\"The Straight Story\\" as examples of an ultra-violent film and an innocent Disney-type family-movie, both of which are truly excellent). So, with that in mind, I believe Irreversible to be a masterpiece, because it forces the viewer to realize the frailty of human condition. To achieve that purpose, the backwards plot is essential because it presents in the first place a tragic consequence; so, when you realize that a terrible tragedy (not only for Monica Bellucci´s character but for other characters as well) is the result of a chain of events, all of which are consequences of a single first event (depicted at the film´s ending), you become aware of the lack of control we have in our lives and that irreversible consequences may follow almost every decision, the realization of which is especially harrowing, since that first event has (apparently) nothing to do with the violence it ultimately causes. In all, this is a really bleak and pessimistic film, so its understandable that someone looking for the average entertainment quota doesn´t care very much for it. However, if you like movies that scar your soul and leave you thinking for many days after, this really is a great film.
B00025ETIW|5.0|My Chemical Romance's second CD is a tribute to their unique style. It is similar to having a rock opera occur in your head. Each song builds upon the story line first introduced within the first few lyrics of the first song. Gerard Way's vocals and the different guitar beats that the band members develop play together in harmony complimenting one another. The message of loss, revenge and the struggle to overcome tragedies in life beautifully mingle in each song. The tragic story the music holds touches the listener in ways only human empathy allows creating for the listener a moment in time to not feel alone.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|This is one of the best-filmed documentaries I've ever seen.  And watching it in High Definition is stunning!  I don't know how they got some of the scenes, but they were amazing!  I would recommend this to anyone, especially children.  It is extremely well done.
B0010YSD7M|4.0|Much in the same vein as S9 & 10, this continues on from the last episode of S10.  If you enjoyed the whole Ori thing, then this is just another 2 hr episode of that.  I think by the time the last film is done they will have totally exhausted all possible plot lines for this series.  But anything that can outlast star trek can't be bad.  Just hope Jack makes an appearance in the final film.......
B000WMOEUS|2.0|This noble is complete garbage. There are so many immigrants Indian novel emphasize Indian immigrant's economic contribution and upheld Indian culture as a whole. On the other hand Bangladeshi immigrant novels, drama, short films must depict Bangladesh in bad way and do an insult to our culture. I often wonder why. I mean immigrant writers from both origins are looking for their 10 minute of fame. That is totally fine. But why you have to pull out some bad smell from closet to do that? You think Indians don't have an ugly story to tell about themselves? But are they saying it to the world? Why would they? I understand that you can just ride along with the tide and make few bucks on the side. You say something bad about Bangladesh, you would get an award. You say badly about India, no one would buy your book. So the incentive is there.      Apart from my political view, this novel is not a representation of Bangladeshi culture: not of Bangladesh, and definitely not of Bangladeshi immigrant in UK. I understand that a writer is free to pick her character from extreme example or even beyond imagination. That's fine. But when you write a novel about a specific community (or you know that it will be portray as so), you must write something in the side to upheld the real picture and to do a fare judgment to that community. It is very fare to say that she knowingly ignore that part.    Here is a reader's comment \\"Monica Ali appears to be telling a story about what she knows best in her novel, Brick Lane. Monica Ali was born in Bangladesh and grew up in London. Most of us do not have background knowledge of Bangladesh, and this book gives us insight into that land and culture.\\"    Imagine that!!

B000NVIXFK|4.0|Some of the reviews here are very nostalgic for old Rush, really old Rush. I got into them during the Roll the Bones era, and not being very aware in their early days (seeing as I either wasn't alive or was very wee) I look back at the older stuff and think \\"some of it rocks, some is quite silly\\". This is a very good album and not at all silly or pretentious. The lyrics are intelligent and thoughtful, in a way that Roll the Bones was. And the music rocks. I just saw this album played live in concert and it was awesome. I am looking forward to more stuff like this!

B0014Z4OQG|5.0|Every single person that I know when asked if they liked this movie, said no way. Being the horror movie buff that I am, I ran out and bought it anyways. In the beginning of the movie where the guy holding the camera is asking for people to say good-bye to his friend, I became a tad bored with it. Then BANG, the movie goes from zero to a hundred and eighty in one blink of an eye. I found myself leaning my head almost like I was the one holding the camera and I was trying to see what was behind the next door. I LOVED THIS MOVIE!!!
B0014Z4OQG|5.0|Cloverfield tends to be met with mixed reviews, but all in all I thought it was a great movie.  It is essentially the journey of four New Yorkers through a Manhattan that is under attack by a Godzilla-like monster, taken from the perspective of a handheld camcorder that is carried with.  While the actors are far from well known, I feel that it gave the film a genuine feel.  Seeing Brad Pitt running around just doesn't make it feel real, honestly.  Some people were not fans of the camcorder, as it tends to get a little wild during action sequences, but I think its usage made the film truly unique.  It's filmed nearly as live-action--that is, it's like watching your own home video, except with a monster frolicking around.    I definitely recommend this movie.  I will say, though, that it is far better to watch in the theaters or on a big screen TV with surround sound.  If you're watching it for the first time, a 13-inch TV just doesn't draw you in as well.
B000N6TX22|4.0|No one is able to have babies for 18 years, all of the sudden a woman is pregnant. there is really no explanation why people can't have babies, and by the time you get into the movie you tend to not care, People live in a world where only a few places are still working (by today's standards) in  future where things are not very different as far as technology, but the most advance working nation in the world looks like a 3rd world country.     This movie truly captivates you with the acting and plot, Great Britain is full of illegal immigrants in this world where no one remembers what a baby looks like, and an immigrant is pregnant, and this creates an obvious problem, immigrants want the baby to be born in England so they can have more power and be able to live in the most advance place in the world, while mom wants to take the kid to \\" the human project\\" a group of scientist that are working on curing infertility.     double crossings and death all over for this baby and you can't think of anything else other than \\"i hope they make it\\" the acting is aaxcelent and the dvd comes with a bunch of extras!
B000GTJT0M|3.0|So this is a movie that has a complete feel of the 30's in the way is acted and kind of in the way is shot, it is very reminiscing of those serials ( like Flash Gordon) that star wars was trying to be like, but turned out to be to epic to capture.     It is shot completely digitally giving the movie a certain \\"feel\\" making it  more like a cartoon in some scenes, but that is beside the point, or perhaps more the point because, like mentioned before, it is supposed to be like one of those old serials which where done in that same light, and with that same kind of acting sometimes. everything from the technology that the characters use to the way they talk is very post WWII pop-America and it is captured well.     the plot is also very fantastic and what was usually written about in the times in which movies like this where being made, but the only thing that takes it out of that kind of context is the sometimes too complicated technology that the plane that Sky Captain (Jude Law) gets from his plane, and how tremendously evolved it is, since usually in those serials the people would be in a future time with amazing technology, or deal with the  treats with usual stuff they had around.     The designs for this movie are also very reminiscing of the times, with robots that appear to be right out  of the Superman 40's cartoons!     I recommend this movie if you have a love for classic simple concept stories told fantastically, with great effects and fun in the acting and action!
B000P0J05G|4.0|In one word this movie is fun, completely over the top and with a lot of silly moments, but there is a reason for all that stuff! Director Sam Raimi making fun of himself and of all the \\"Horror\\" he had put Ash trough in the previous two movies (the evil dead and the evil dead 2) that was still silly, and over the top!       Ash being pulled by the power of the Necronomicon gets sent to a weird version of medieval England (even though he is in the states) where he has to get the Necronomicon to get him back in time. What is totally ridiculous about this movie (aside from EVERYTHING) is that Ash is such a moron that he just gets thrown back in this evil time by the Necronomicon, but when he hears mention of the book, its like he never heard of it before, but he is smart enough to build himself a robot hand, and make explosives.     This is not a movie that you would watch for the really smart dialog, or for a well made horror flick, or even a sci-fi adventure that makes any kind of sense, but laughing out loud fun!!!
B000002L7Y|4.0|Luis Mejia (son) - A-ha made a consistent but little impact in the 80s' music, and their debut itself is very representative; the music is an epilogue of synthpop, that mix of electronic music with pop stands. As of the bests, there is the massive hit \\"Take On Me\\", a soaring pop jewel, but the popular impact were Harket vocal pitch, and \\"The Sun Always Shine On TV\\", which got to be a minor hit, being consistent toward the fake media attitude, which with the song, it got interpretated pretty well. The self titled is the most serious piece of music in the album, \\"Living A Boy's Adventure Tale\\" is refreshing and perfectly flowing, while \\"Love Is Reason\\" is another top quality. \\"Here I Stand And Face The Rain\\" is obviously the most elaborate piece of the album, the songcraft is prooven marvelous. A-ha's music is really underground, that's why they were a commercial bomb in Europe and South America, and though they were first packaged as a plastified, boy-charm sluggish band, this is their most famous and maybe the most accessible.
0307265730|5.0|Unaccustomed Earth is a remarkable collection of stories.  Even though Lahiri uses mostly her common themes (coming of age stories of immigrants and their children) the works have a little bit of something extra, a bit of danger in the case of a few stories, deeper and different relationships in others.<br /><br />I literally could not put this book down after I started it, with each story keeping me captivated through the pages.  I would recommend this book to old fans of Lahiri's and to new readers--the stories are so powerful that they will keep you going, and possibly have you wishing for Lahiri's next work--like I am--by the end.
038533348X|5.0|This book isn't for everyone, that's for sure. The central theme is a fictional religion based around the principal that everything is a lie. The first line makes that clear. Characters include a midget, an introverted modelmaker who forced bugs to fight one another in his younger years, a man who is forced to make bicycles for blind people in Afghanistan, an insane elevator operator, a maniacal dictator, a sex symbol from a fictional island, the man who helped invent the atomic bomb (and has an odd fascination with turtles), a particularly destructive nihilist, and a doctor named \\"Breed\\", believed to have an affair. Some of the most memorable scenes involve all possible meanings of the term \\"Mayonnaise\\", fun with indexing, and a twenty-foot phallus used as a gravestone. Oh, and there are 127 chapters, each of them a page long on average.<br />If all that just strikes you as weird, then Vonnegut really isn't the guy for you. The fact that this is normal in comparison to my favorite Vonnegut book, Breakfast of Champions, should say a lot about him. After all, this guy has one of the strangest senses of humor in literary history. His work really is inaccessible.<br />I think he's great, though. He's got the same absurdist sense of humor as I do, and he's a social critic to rival the best of them. Especially here, where he mocks both science and religion, two very different fields. It's a hilarious book, but there's more to it than just the humor. There's also the underlying social and political implications, which is really what makes it fly.<br />This isn't a good book in the traditional, \\"descriptive setting, fleshed-out characters\\" sense. I don't think it was meant to be. Instead, it's a wild, fast-paced ride, which moves from one biting indictment of society (he takes on everything from patriotism to nihilism). It's hilarious, it's enlightening, it's distinctive... it's pure Vonnegut.
006135323X|1.0|Dan Ariely makes claims about economics being flawed because of his personal experiments.   These claims lead you to wonder if he has so much as read one book on economics.  His experiments in this book would be more useful to someone interested in marketing/sales techniques.   And, that could have been summed up in about 20 pages.  Total waste of time and money.
B00004RF83|5.0|This is one of the great movies of the cold war era. The acting by Burt Lancaster, Kirk Douglass et al is superb. One of the things that I rarely do is watch the director's clip on the making of a movie. This movie is one that you must do so. To listen to Frakenheimer describe the how he was able to get JFK's permission to film in front of the White House; the discussion about the riot scenes...well just buy the movie, you won't be sorry.
B00006DEF9|1.0|The DVD is not of good quality, as it skips/tracks poorly in two or three sections of the movie.  As a matter of fact, I plan to return it for a refund or an exchange!!
B0000640SA|5.0|This is a really good movie. Guy Pearce, Carrie-Anne Moss, and Joe Pantaliano are very good in this. Christopher Nolan directed his brother's story very well. This is a movie in which you find yourself investigating something different each time. After the movie's over, you may find yourself debating which characters were actually honest and sincere and who were not.     The dvd package is very cool. This is the kind of product you can appreciate because it's unique and the layout of the case inside and out reflects the characteristics of the movie. The inside flips upward. There's post-it notes on the inside and pages from a psychiatric file (Leonard Shelby's).     The menu screens reflect a psychiatric test (memorization, personality surveys). You may find it annoying. I kind of do, but at least they put some thought and effort into it.    Good movie, Cool DVD. 5/5 for the product overall.
B0010X73ZG|5.0|It kept me glued to the screen. It held my nerves on edge until I was bound tighter than a rubber band ball! I loved the story itself, the way the government was messing with another dimension...awesome concept! Everyone seems to be whining about the ending but I have to tell you that it was an incredible ending to an incredible movie. It was beautiful how Stephen King was able to portray an overly religious zealot's mind, to the point where you yourself wanted to choke the life out of her. Brilliant!!!
B000ZLFALI|5.0|Julie Taymor once again uses her considerable innovative magic to create a film that not only is mesmerizingly beautiful to watch, but also a 'semi-documentary' about the world changes that occurred in the late 1960s and early 1970s as young people for the first time spoke out against the war in Vietnam, the death of Martin Luther King, and the senseless mayhem that extended from the battlefields of Vietnam to the streets of America, all set to the significant, timely music of the Beatles. It sounds like an impossible juxtaposition of themes and ideas, but in Taymor's hands it succeeds.<br /><br />Opening in Liverpool, England (where the Beatles began their impact on music and thought) we met Jude (Jim Sturgess), a working class boy with the gifts of an artist who decides to set off on a sea journey to meet the father he has never known. Once in New York he meets Max (Joe Anderson) and Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood) who represent the wealthy class,  but who both show roots of rebellion against the comfortable norm and an objection to the war that is festering like an abscess in the rice paddies of Vietnam. Jude meets his janitor father in a union that is anticlimactic, and in disappointment he falls in with Max, living the artists' life in the Village with free-wheeling singer Sadie (Dana Fuchs), her beau/guitarist JoJo (Martin Luther) and their newest tenant Prudence (T.V. Carpio), an Asian girl trying to find her place in a confusing world.  The group eventually bond with music and rebellion mixed with free love and the passion that they can make a difference, while around them racial crises are at a peak and the draft tags many of the young men (including Max) for the war they cannot condone.  From all of this turmoil the story builds to a climax leading to some very touching scenes that convey the spirit of the times and the overriding importance of love and understanding in a world torn apart by political and racial crises.<br /><br />The cast is strong with each of the actors singing their own versions of various Beatle songs very well  (the division between singing and spoken dialect favors the former).  But the real magic comes from Julie Taymor's mixture of hallucinogenic visuals, wonderfully choreographed crowd scenes, and ingenious movement from reality scenes displayed on the television to the reactive scenes of the world as viewed through the eyes of the youths and the lyrics of the songs.  It is at once touching in its ability to recreate a particular period of history and wholly entertaining in the inventive use of music/dance/visual effects/drama. This film is important now and will only increase in stature as a document of that troubled but exciting time in the history of the world.  We can only wonder why the youth of today are not responding to the Iraq War in a like manner, or, more uncomfortable to consider, why we,  now as adults, can't muster the same degree of distress about the myriad traumas that are still happening 'Across the Universe'.

B00004BZ16|4.0|You have to hear this album at least once in your life, if just for the pure scope of the thing. Thirty-six tracks that feature the group doing reggae, dub, funk, hip-hop, music hall, rockabilly, pop, jazz, Motown, avant-garde, some crazy stuff that can't be classified, and yes, some punk. You thought London Calling was ambitious? You haven't heard ambitious until you've heard this. And maybe I'm out of my mind, but I like it loads, and not just because of the awesome cover art and huge smorgasbord of styles on display. Plenty of these songs are classics (or \\"Clashics\\"?). \\"The Magnificent Seven\\", the hip-hop song I talked about, leads the way and just might be the greatest Clash song in history. Joe Strummer sounds so cool delivering the black-humored lyrics, and he's one of the few convincing white rappers out there. \\"Hitsville, U.K.\\" is a wonderfully adorable Motown ditty. \\"Junco Partner\\" is a brilliant pub reggae song. \\"Ivan Meets G.I. Joe\\" uses brilliantly creative synthesizers to simulate gunfire. \\"Something About England\\" is an inspired duet between Mick and Joe. \\"The Crooked Beat\\" is an awesome reggae song with a marching band rhythm. \\"Somebody Got Murdered\\" rules in its New Wave/pop/anti-violence goodness. \\"One More Time\\" is another awesome reggae song, like everything else related to reggae on this album. And I don't mind the dub version, \\"One More Dub\\", even though many tend to despise it. It really allows me to soak in the song's mood. I love that one's mood, so the more of it I can get, the better. \\"Lightning Strikes (Not Once But Twice)\\" is a kick-butt return to \\"Magnificent Seven\\"-esque funk. \\"If Music Could Talk\\" is a fun fusion of lounge jazz and ska. I think I may be the only person on Earth who likes it, by the way. Whatever. Screw people. Anyway, \\"Police on My Back\\" totally rocks, but is the only song on this album that does so. It's also another candidate for \\"best song the Clash ever did\\", just because of the pure combustible energy of the thing and the awesome guitar riff. \\"Midnight Log\\" is pure fast-paced campy fun. \\"The Equalizer\\" is awesome dub reggae tune number sixty million billion, and it's got a violin! \\"The Call-Up\\" is a good anti-war pop song, though it's a bit of an odd choice for a single. I like it, though. \\"Washington Bullets\\" is an awesome experiment with Caribbean music with really political lyrics. \\"Charlie Don't Surf\\" is a near-unclassifiable reggae-R&B-rock fusion that kicks my butt. \\"Kingston Advice\\" and \\"Junkie Advice\\" are fun, fast, energetic reggae tunes. \\"The Street Parade\\" is creepy, menacing, weirdly produced, and amazing. \\"Version City\\" is funky reggae, and it's good! \\"Silicone on Sapphire\\" is a cool and futuristic and Matrix-esque dub of \\"Washington Bullets\\" that's probably totally unnecessary, but totally sweet anyway. I'll freely admit that the remix of \\"Junco Partner\\", here titled \\"Version Pardner\\", is bad, though. See, I know I've spent a majority of this review gushing over this album, but the truth is there are quite a few weak songs on it. I can let the children's choir remake of \\"Career Opportunities\\" pass, because it's cute. But there are some really bad songs here. I mean, what is to be expected from a thirty-six track triple-album not called Emancipation by Prince? (And, wouldn't you know it, the only other thirty-six track triple-album I know of is Emancipation by Prince). In reality, I only find seven of these thirty-six bad, but... god, they suck! \\"Look Here\\" is a terrible jazz song. \\"Corner Soul\\" and \\"Broadway\\" are crappy show tunes. \\"The Sound of Sinners\\" is gospel, and it's not good gospel either, not like that wasn't terribly obvious or anything. I mean, how are the Clash gonna do gospel and make it any good at all? Anyway, \\"Lose This Skin\\" is the worst Clash song not on Cut the Crap. It's a pub jig with a really screwed-up violin and an awful vocal with someone named Tymon Dogg. And \\"Mensforth Hill\\" is a sound collage. So that's seven absolutely horrendous songs. The remaining seven aren't really worthy of mention, because they don't stand out one way or another. I suppose I find \\"Up in Heaven\\" a bit overproduced, and \\"Rebel Waltz\\" just kinda weird, even by this one's standards. So yes, this definitely could've been shortened. But if you were to take off all the bad and mediocre tracks, you'd be left with... a twenty-two track double-album! Not only that, but that twenty-two track double album would probably my favorite Clash album, even though as of now I like the first one more. The fact that a majority of these tracks are great, and how disparate the material is, says a lot about just how damn good the Clash were. One of my favorite bands ever. By the way, have you heard they didn't accept royalties for this, even though they were flat broke when they released it? Even if you don't like the music, you gotta admit that is admirable.ngs.

B00133KHCY|5.0|Loved the story, even though the ending was a bit unrealistic, but hey, it's a movie so I'm use to endings I don't like.  Overall, I loved the story and the younger actors and actresses in this movie were superb.  I recommend it highly.
0439813786|5.0|The purpose of this book is to be - well - not  like any book we've ever seen. Part book, part illustrated story, part movie,  part magic, part theatrics, all woven together very artfully and imaginatively. It took me a few pages to get what the author was doing and then I loved that this was a new way to present a story. If you only like books one way - and, ironically,  if you are a super \\"black and white\\" person - then this book may not appeal to you . . . but give it a try anyway! Easy read, slightly predictable for the adult reader, but oh so magical and breathtaking!!! (And you even learn some film history along the way) Wouldn't recommend for readers under 8 since there are several harsh realities of life such as parents dying, extreme poverty, etc., but this book is destined to be a classic. Great for all levels of readers - pages are not crammed with text, and 200+ of the pages are illustrations.

0380789035|1.0|Like Neil Gaiman's other book \\"Good Omens\\" (written with Terry Pratchett), Gaiman builds very interesting premises and characterizations, and yet falls short on the plot. His endings are never satisfactory. I think he is a whiz at developing fantastic characters and scenes, but that's just about it -- he's all about settings and characters, but never the story. His plot lines are shallow and thin.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong -- I actually thought I'd give him a chance and read his work (because my friends were raving about him, and my curiosity compelled me to find out what's to rave about him), but after reading \\"Good Omens\\" (I think Gaiman's stories get a bit stronger if someone else writes with him) and \\"American Gods,\\" and even watching \\"Mirror Mask,\\" I just concluded that he's not much of a storyteller after all. I know that these three works are not entirely representative of what he can do, but I don't think I'd find any of his other work that interesting.
B0007P3582|5.0|Other than his first album ready to die this is a master piece, Gangsta rap weather you hate him or love 50 i personally like hip hop in general and not caught up in all that west coast, east coast bs. Tell people this album sucks only cause you hate 50 go ahead.

0671799320|5.0|As a third generation oilman, this book, while now dated by about eighteen years, gives the reader one of the best oil and gas history books ever written. It was the last book that my father, a wiildcatter for over forty years, read before his death and he too was amazed how Mr. Yergin was able to take such enormous amount of information and distill it down into a narrative as if one were there during the major events that shaped the petroleum industry.  If only the so-called envirnomentalists would lift a finger and read books like this, their credibilty as to the subject matter would rise dramatically.  What is striking about this particular history book on the petroleum industry, is how Mr. Yergin does a tremendous job in informing the reader how petroleum actually brought human society into what we now call the \\"modern age\\" and how the industry truly affected almost every event over the last 150 years, from scientific advancements to world wars.  I would put this book into the category of required reading for anyone entering the oil and gas business right up there with \\"The Greatest Gamblers\\" written almost a half century ago by Ruth Sheldon Knowles.
0385338082|5.0|I love everything that Sophie Kinsella writes.  The plot of this story was just so clever.  I couldn't put it down!  Just know that wherever you are while you're reading it--coffee shop, carpool pickup line at school, wherever--you WILL laugh out loud and people will wonder what you're up to!  :)    If you want to read something heavy and meaningful, this isn't it, but if you want something light and happy that will take your mind off of whatever is weighing it down, RUN to your local bookstore and pick it up!  I like the heavy stuff sometimes, too, but this book is simply a joy.  I was so sad when I finished it!

1400063515|4.0|This is Taleb's follow up to \\"Fooled by Randomness.\\"  I found the lessons of both books to be important and instructive for both investing and, more generally, for life.  Just like a Black Jack player who overvalues results (\\"lucky\\" or \\"unlucky streaks\\") and not the quality of play, Taleb teaches the philosophy of focusing on making the right probability-adjusted decision.  Moreover, he teaches to evaluate decisions (your own or those of others) based on the info at hand at the time of the decision.  It is easy to judge a decision based solely on results, but that is misleading as it does not account for the potential events that could have occurred but did not.    I found Taleb's philosophy compelling.  Also, his direct, no-holds-barred conversational style is easy to read.  He does ramble in places as he hammers certain points home.  This is not necessarily elegant prose.  However, the points are important and overall this is entertaining and instructive reading.

B0013FBTHO|4.0|I ordered this movie from amazon.com to Germany because we'll get it here not earlier than the end of May 2008. I was really impressed by the picture quality (5 stars \\"reference quality\\" therefore) of the movie, the story was at least partly fascinating. However, I enjoyed it. Having purchased an HD-DVD player some weeks ago (during HDDVD sellout), I am temporarily more keen on buying movies with a high image quality and I am not so intent on the movie itself (I didn't enjoy the standard DVD-quality before).
0307383415|5.0|This coming-of-age story is masterly. Barack Hussein Obama controls his narrative and thereby presents the self he wants the rest of us to use as our personal point of departure for describing and judging him.    DREAMS FROM MY FATHER has been well and frequently reviewed. I shall simply add a thought or two derived from watching the Illinois Senator's autobiographies extend themselves into his 2004 speech at the Democratic National Convention and into the 2007 and 2008 Presidential campaigns. What insights into his race-consciousness, religion and patriotism emerge from comparing the text of DREAMS FROM MY FATHER with more recent events?    Senator Obama's father, Barack Obama, Senior, had called himself \\"Barry\\" when he came from Kenya to study in Hawaii. There he married Ann Dunham. With her parents Miss Dunham had moved there in 1959. Barry Junior, as he was taught to call himself, presents his white Kansas-reared mother and grandparents as, respectively, utterly detached from all structured religion or having once been lightly brushed by mainstream Protestant Christianity. The author speaks of himself from earliest years as notably introspective, detached from any passionate entanglements and severely analytical. Grandparents and mother raised him for all but four of his growing years, spent in Indonesia with his second, nominally Muslim, father figure, in this case his mother's second husband.    OBAMA AND RACE    Although genetically 1/2 American white and 1/2 Kenyan black, young Barry Obama (or \\"Bar\\" to the American grandfather who helped rear him) early chose to think himself as an American black. At his own request he stayed behind in Hawaii with his grandparents to complete his secondary schooling when his mother and half-sister returned without him to Indonesia. He grew up in a Hawaii accepting of races and mixed races. Only later did young Barry grasp that \\"I was supposed to have a live-in father\\" or \\"know that I needed a race\\" (p. 27) Later his mother taught Barry to be proud of his divorced father and his black lineage (51). A picture in LIFE magazine of a black man so ashamed of his color that he tried to peel off his skin made the youngster feel ambushed. A hidden horrible insight flashed upon him: personal enemies, racial bigots, were \\"out there\\" and \\"could reach me without anyone's knowledge, even my own\\" (51). Slowly, the boy decided that he must remain behind in Hawaii with white grandparents and raise himself \\"to be \\"a black man in America. (76)    OBAMA AND RELIGION    After college, Barack Obama did social organizing within a group of black churches in South Chicago. His upbringing had been un-religious, though his anthropologist mother was \\"spiritual.\\" Being black in South Chicago opened doors all by itself: \\"my color had always been a sufficient criterion for community membership, enough of a cross to bear\\" (178).     If they were meeting him for the first time via telephone, some pastors were suspicious that he was a white Irishman named O'Bama (279). One day old Reverend Philips suggested that an obviously discouraged Obama's political goals for 50-odd black churches were failing for pulling black pastors away from \\"some of our more priestly concerns in favor of prophecy\\"(274). Those pastors might trust Barack more if they were sure that he was a man of faith, a member of a church -- any church.     And Rev. Philips and other black ministers converged in suggesting that Barack get to know Reverend Jeremiah Wright, Jr., pastor of Trinity United Church of Christ. Over a fair number of pages (274,280-287, 291-295)the author sketches Reverend Wright and his initial impact on the young black-conscious social worker.     In his follow-on book, THE AUDACITY OF HOPE (titled for a Wright sermon), Barack Obama briefly describes his conversion and baptism at Trinity United Church of Christ. He was now a Christian, having had no religion before. From his own words it seems that the only kind of Christian he would agree to be was a Black American Christian.     OBAMA AND PATRIOTISM    Patriotism is not a heavy theme in DREAMS FROM MY FATHER. Racism colors all aspects, Obama says, of multi-racial America. It is not easy to be black in America.  When Junior was growing up, Obama Senior was back in Kenya, at times seeming about to carve a very prominent place for himself in national politics. But his inflexible adherence to principle lost him the patronage of President Jomo Kenyatta. Still, with input from his mother, young Barack phantasized about his father's greatness and came to the conclusion that, only if he could penetrate his dark, non-American father, could he ever understand himself. And to understand himself was at all times the driving crusade in the life of Barack Hussein Obama. \\"I had no idea who my real self was\\"(82).     A man I know suggested that all that is genetically American in the Senator is white, along with the vast bulk of his nurture. My acquaintance also opined that in turning his face away from his genetic and nurtured whiteness, Obama also deliberately turned his back on everything about him that came from America. He thought that this turning away from whiteness might perhaps explain some of the senator's apparent hang-up about wearing an American flag lapel pin -- an expression of solidarity to most Americans.    CONCLUSION: DREAMS FROM MY FATHER is a superior book from a superior communicator. The current junior senator from Illinois comes across as self-absorbed and self-conscious from his earliest years. But that sense of cool superiority to others which some think he now projects was, in this book, no more than an unusually developed sense of detachment, far from a studied aloofness which some now profess to find in the Presidential candidate. -OOO-
B0010X745K|5.0|The creative and imaginative Stephen King has pulled it off again, and hats off to Frank Darabont (Directing and ending) and Bernie Wrightson (special fx), also.  This was one of my favorite short stories I read years ago by King.  The way they brought this to life with really good acting and directing, the special effects, the creepy atmosphere and the cinematography, is just captivating!  This film is paced and balanced very well from beginning to end...and the twisted ending really tops it off nicely.  This is an adventure worth five stars!
B0008ENHUI|4.0|i saw this movie in the cinema a very long time ago and it left an impression on my mind,for me to remember it and to want to own a copy of it demonstrates the powerful message of how good it is.it is also a true story which makes it even more \\"valuable\\".i am impressed at the lengths to which papillon went to obtain his freedom,the tortures he endured in prison -solitary isolation,hunger,abuse,unsanitary conditions,being shipped away to french guyana and left on an uninhabited island with a fellow inmate.yet he persevered, he studied the movement of the waves and he was able to make his great escape and survive many years after that a free man.it is just an amazing movie and a must see for anyone who likes the determination which we all have ingrained in us for freedom and the lengths we will go to obtain it.
B0014Z4OQG|4.0|First, the entire movie is only 75 minutes long.  Don't believe the 85-minute running time claim on the DVD box, as the rest is just the credits.  Maybe they were paying tribute to the old monster movies that were typically 70-75 minutes long, but I felt a little cheated by that.     While there was room for improvement, overall, I liked this movie.  One thing I really liked is that it isn't a remake or a sequel (we've had more than enough of those).  It was definitely different and had the feel of an old-style monster movie, but with modern special effects.    I get the whole \\"you are there\\" handheld camera concept, but it got to be distracting and annoying (it's hard to believe the camcorder shown in the film would've had no image stabilization).  The characters were annoying (especially Hud), and who would be stupid enough to go into a monster-infested city war zone to find his ex-girlfriend?  Then again, those who tag along with said idiot would be considered even more stupid.  And how is it that someone impaled on a rebar can be running around with no problems a few minutes later?     The cons aside, the special effects were great, and once the mind-numbing first 15 minutes were over, the movie was quite enjoyable.  I liked the monster, especially its scream, and the parasites were very nice.  For those who complain \\"there was nothing about where the monster came from,\\" pay attention to the ship in the harbor in the last scene.       My fear is that we are now going to get 314 more movies done entirely in first-person handheld camera mode, since if there's anything Hollywood knows how to do, it's copy other successful films to death.   Kudos to JJ Abrams for giving us a different kind of movie.  If you can handle the jerky camera movement, it's a worthwhile rental.
0823016714|4.0|It's a great idea, but as a comic artist I could have used a lot more younger models. The models transition to old age groups too rapidly. I would love to see a 'volume II' that included more children and teens, and perhaps some additional models in the age groups that were included, but in different racial choices.    Even so, it is well done, very useful, and six months after I bought it, already getting a little dirty from all the use it has gotten (too much eraser dust in the air!) Thumbs up.

B00005YJMX|3.0|Werner Herzog is one of those self-proclaimed cinematic geniuses who writes, produces, directs, takes the tickets ... all that. Some years ago he undertook to remake the 1922 silent classic, \\"Nosferatu\\". The result is the 1979 flick, \\"Nosferatu the Vampyre\\". The last word isn't exactly a misspelling: they often spelled it that way in the Victorian and Edwardian eras. Nowadays it's an affectation, and this little anachronism ought to give us a clue as to the film's (apparent) true intent. This isn't so much a remake as a parody ... it's not \\"Dracula: Dead and Loving It\\" (alas), but rather an almost-humorless Teutonic parody. Once you get past the deliberate dead-panning, it's hilarious.    Now, I have no proof of this, other than the evidence (which, of course, is evidence in court). One correspondent assures me that Werner Herzog hasn't got a \\"parody\\" bone in his body and that his comments on the DVD version of the film don't begin to speculate about the merest suspicion of a contemplation of the containing of even a hint of such a thing. Well, how do you make a good dead-pan parody if you then admit it?    But consider the evidence. Although this is a remake of the original Nosferatu, some things have been done to bring it closer to the traditional \\"Dracula\\" story -- primarily the introduction of Dr. Van Helsing. There's a big clue -- in this film Van Helsing absolutely doesn't believe in vampires until the very last few minutes. And then he takes it into his head to drive a stake into Dracula, who has already been killed by sunlight. The overkill is a nice parody touch.     The relationships between the basic characters has changed. Lucy is Mrs. Harker, and Harker works for Renfield. The last, although he apparently has never laid eyes on Dracula, is (also apparently) under his spell -- he giggles at lot for no good reason: a manic Dr. Hibbert. In fact, the only character in the film who believes (a) in vampires and (b) that Dracula is one is Lucy (who, in the original story, has no such opinions). Van Helsing is a local doctor who has decided that local victims of the vampire have died of plague. It's true that the ship that brought Dracula also brought a bunch of rats ... scads and slathers of white (!!) rats, or perhaps oversize lab mice. Whenever they appear, they are shown in exaggerated piles and clumps, like hundreds of malformed puppies.     Parody here is often in the little details. Dracula's chiming clock, with a prominent skull on top and a skeleton going in and out doors below, is a great bit of guignol, but wonderfully out of place otherwise. And of course the music. Most of it is by Popul Vuh (often oddly folksy but usually appropriately creepy), but some is by Wagner -- specifically a few moments from the prelude to Rheingold. It's music related to the Rhein and the creation of the world. The music appears in 2 scenes, for both of which it is wholly inappropriate due both to the general character of the music and to its meaning in the Wagnerian universe. The scenes are: Harker travelling through a mountain pass to Dracula's castle and Dracula moving his coffins off-ship to his new home. Such use of this music is -- as Hertzog would well know -- laughable.     There is also the question of black-suited, black-hatted morticians/pallbearers. There seems to be quite a population of these people in Wismar (a canal-laced ancient city in Mecklenburg, near the Baltic Sea). At one point a whole parade of them bring out the coffins of the dead. It appears that everyone in Wismar is dying except these macabre individuals. Their march-with-coffins is a masterpiece of dark humor. Remembering it still drives me to laughter.    Finally, there is Klaus Kinsky's performance of Dracula. Critics have minced no words about how wonderful it is, how creepy, how appropriate. It seems to me that Kinsky isn't so much creepy as somnolent, as if he had a really bad case of weltschmerz. A vampire is one of the great powers of the supernatural world: a shape-shifter, preternaturally strong, a powerful mesmeriser. Kinsky seems more meserized. As a vampire he is diffident and shy, almost apologetic about being what he is. How brilliant!  This isn't playing to type but playing against it. And that, friends, is parody. Or, to quote Warner Brothers, \\"Now, THAT'S comedy!\\"
B000VXLC3K|4.0|I'll admit -- I'm one of those people who feel that TAPESTRY is one of the greatest albums of all time.  So my review of this new 2-CD edition is colored by that view.<br /><br />TAPESTRY is one of only a handful of albums ever released that contains only total winners (in terms of songs).  Many artists produce great albums, but there are always a couple of songs that I don't like as much as the others.  Not so with TAPESTRY.  Every song on the album deserves five stars.<br /><br />This 2-CD set contains the complete original album, along with a second disc of previously-unreleased live recordings of (most of) the songs from the album.  These live versions were chosen because they strip the songs down to their pure essence -- Carole at the keyboard and on vocals, with nothing else.  This is a fantastic thing to have paired with the original album.  Sound quality is excellent, performances are inspired and passionate.<br /><br />The set loses a star, though, because it's just not as good as it COULD have been.  TAPESTRY has already been issued in a remastered, expanded edition.  (This version appears to be the same mastering as the previous one.)  However, the first expanded edition included two bonus tracks (one a previously-unreleased studio track, the other a live recording), and neither of those bonus tracks were included in this new edition.  So if you want to have a \\"complete\\" TAPESTRY, you have to own both versions of the album.  To me, this smacks of record company greed -- let's see how many times we can get these suckers to buy the same album.  Sony has done this same thing recently with Michael Jackson's THRILLER.  And Elvis Costello fans know all about this sort of thing...<br /><br />If you're a Carole King fan, you will definitely want this set.  If you don't care about live versions of the songs, you can stick with the single-disc remastered version from a few years back.  But if, like me, you're a die-hard aficionado, you'll have to have both.  It's only shelf space!
B0017XD3OY|5.0|It seems like people expected something else from this movie. What it delivers is a borderline epic account of a man who believes he is the last person alive - who's only hope to find companionship is to cure the disease which plagues the \\"zombies\\" which haunt the night.    What it does NOT deliver is your run of the mill zombie movie - endowed with decapitations and handguns which hold thousands of rounds in a single magazine.     This movie will have you on the edge of your seat from the opening scene. You'll find yourself making predictions about what's going to happen so that you can comfort and calm yourself down.     NOTHING prepared me for \\"I Am Legend\\". This is a zombie/survival movie which stands completely apart from any other I've seen. The elements of realism and emotion are portrayed meticulously and perfectly - and there are plenty of satisfying action sequences.     Don't be fooled by disappointed reviewers. This movie is worth watching. Will Smith is brilliant, and the cinematography is breathtaking.

B000000W5N|5.0|If you are looking for a real stones album, not just hits, you won't regret this one. An album like this one assures stones fans as to why the stones have made it through all the years and lackluster albums. There is one reason more than any other that I reccomend this. Yes, wild horses is on here. And for any person wether or not you like, love, hate the stones, a person cannot deny wild horses, it is one of the few songs in this world that can always bring about feeling within, no matter how many times you hear it. There arn't many songs that can do that, personally I think it's magic can only compare to that of say....Van Morrison's \\"sweet thing\\". But if you have heard either one of those songs too many times, and want to feel what it was like to hear one of those songs for the first time..........all one has to do is listen to 'Moonlight Mile\\"...and you will listen to it over and over. It is a masterwork of a song. And if all of that's not your thing.....\\"you gotta move\\" is a great song and the kind of song that makes you think and hope that with all the years behind them, the stones would just say....enough with the R.S. image, lets go make a really great blues album, go out on a high note and let everone remember us for being artists and not celebrites. I always hope that a new stones album means a throwback to the sound of \\"you gotta move\\", but it never does.

B00005YU1O|2.0|I watched this movie with all the anticipation of someone who had heard stellar reviews from professionals and friends alike. As a huge fan of art film, I was prepared to watch it and declare a new favorite.    To say the least, I was disappointed.    This is a self-indulgent journey into the mind of a self-important writer who fancies himself in the same league as Aristotle by asking questions that might as well be, \\"Is that a reflection of myself in the mirror, or is the real world going on inside the mirror and I'm merely the reflection?\\"     Philosphy for 3rd graders, I suppose.    This is absurdity at its most inflated and self-aggrandizing. The method of animating live-action film is the only innovative feature here, and it's really rather pointless, unless you buy into what the makers are selling, in which case it you would consider it pure genius, i'm sure.    I gave it 2 stars simply because it's at least an attempt at something important. Unfortunately, it falls very, very short.

B000002P6R|3.0|I love The Who. It's fair to say that I am a Who collector. Their music is some of the finest ever made, and it's for that reason that the group made it to the Rock and Roll Hall Of Fame.    Take yourself back to 1979. Keith Moon has just died. John Bonham would follow Moon to the grave pretty quickly afterwards. The situation? Zeppelin and The Who were left \\"drummerless.\\" The Who fixed their problem by adding former (Small) Faces drummer Kenney Jones, while Led Zeppelin pulled the plug on their group entirely.    'You Better You Bet,' of course, got the most radio play from 'Face Dances,' which joins 'It's Hard' in the worst Who record category. The song is catchy, but other than that, there is really no other reason to listen to this.     It's more of Townshend's synth-pop with Roger and John just simply playing along. This type of music would inspire Pete to do songs like 'Let My Love Open The Door,' among other songs of his in the 1980s during his solo career.    This is recommended, but only for Who completists or Townshend solo fans.

B000002AZ8|4.0|Pearl Jam-Vitalogy ***1/2<br /><br />Sorry but Vitalogy is far from being Pearl Jam's best album. I just can't for the life of me understand how this has developed the reputation it has. Of the first four albums from the band this is the weakest. Vedder's lyrics are nice here but fail to evoke anything. The band here sounds great but at the same time this album seriously feels like they are trying to be The Replacements. This sounds and feels a lot like The Replacements first album Sorry Ma, Forgot To Take Out The Trash.<br /><br />'Last Exit' and 'Spin The Black Circle' are two of the best songs on the album, but they are also the two songs on the album that sound the most like The Replacements, which is fine with me as The Replacements are truly one of the greatest bands of all time. 'Not For You' and the erratic 'Tremor Christ' once again find the boys sounding like The 'Mats. But this time toward the end of The Replacements career rather than the start. 'Nothingman' might be the best song on the album, and it remarkably sounds nothing like anyone other than Pearl Jam, which is a good thing. 'Bugs' is nonsense an a serious misstep for Eddie Vedder, and the accordion is over-kill and down right annoying after the first three notes. 'Better Man' is the big single of the album and one of Pearl Jams greatest songs, and one that personally scares the junk out of me. The thought of being in a  false relationship with someone who claims to love you but doesn't, that is scary. The rest of the album is hit or miss for me and mostly ends up being miss.<br /><br />Now it was one thing when The Ramones became a parody of themselves in the 1980's but Pearl Jam didn't even do that, they became a parody of the original flannel wearing Replacements, and so early in their career. Sad. Vitalogy is an album worth owning as the good material is really good, but for the casual PJ fan your better of with Yeild, or their self titled, and Vs.

B00005QY5Y|5.0|Ryan Adams-Gold *****<br /><br />Gold just might be his best album. It certainly was the one that put him on the map. Before Gold he had a slight following leftover from his days in Whiskeytown, and the few solo albums he had released previous to Gold, but this really introduced him to the mainstream and that is mostly due to the semi-hit single 'New York, New York.' The video for the song was actually played on MTV which was the first and only time that ever happened for him.<br /><br />The success of the album led to Adams recording albums at a break-neck pace, all of which being good but not always being the solid albums they could be because of the little amount of time spent on recording. 'New York New York' the lovely plead of 'Firecracker' and 'Somehow, someday' are classic Adams. The melancholy 'Nobody Girl' and the now T-mobile theme song 'Gonna Make You Love Me' were a different side of Adams not shown before but were a pleasant welcome.<br /><br />For Ryan Adams, Gold is as good as it gets, though I must say he is one artist who should be explored in full. All his material should be explored. Gold, alongside his other album Easy Tiger are among the best albums to be released since 2000. Highly Recommended.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I have read many, many biographies and auto-biographies of great Americans from the Revolutionary War to the 21st century and an even greater number of historical non-fiction books written about amazing people during amazing times in history. None equal this one. If a Pulitzer winner could win a Pulitzer, the novel this movie was based on should be it.   The HBO series did justice to David McCullough's incredible masterpiece of John and Abigail Adams in every way. Based almost entirely on their private correspondence, the very words that these great Americans wrote and spoke will make you weep when you understand their vision and sacrifice for the freedoms we enjoy and take for granted every day.

B0012OQZWA|5.0|Oddly enough, when I picked up this album, I expected to be disappointed due to the short number of tracks. But, having played the album all day since, I'll say thanks to Origin, for limiting this album to just 10 songs...any more would have made would have simply caved my head in. It's a thermonuclear bomb of brutal technicality because, despite its somewhat condensed size, it packs more than enough of a serious punch.    Seriously, there isn't a weak track on here. Not a one. I'm trying to narrow down a couple of songs as exemplars for people to sample, and it's proving quite a challenge. Regardless, \\"The Aftermath\\" immediately sets the mood; absolutely no foreplay, just a sudden, unrelenting crush of exacting riffs, blasting drums, and :36 seconds into the song come the vicious dual screams of the vocalists that I came to know and love on 'Inhumanitas'. The masterful formula goes on without a pause throughout the album, \\"Wrath of Vishnu\\" brings us the insane drumming at its finest, with a break-down that had me screaming in admiration in the car, and \\"Antithesis\\"...sweet suffering crap, does that song ever complete an album!    The only question left is what will our government do to control the proliferation of \\"Antithesis\\" and make sure it doesn't fall into the wrong hands? Replete with references to Dr. Oppenheimer's famous aphorism after the successful Manhattan Project test (\\"I am become Death, destroyer of worlds\\") 'Antithesis' respectfully adopts a nuclear theme by being thermonuclear itself. I can't wait to listen to this again with \\"Trinity and Beyond\\" playing muted in the background.

That's the second thing they teach you.\\"<br /><br />Ronin is undoubtedly John Frankenheimer's final masterpiece. Here is a film that stands out from the majority of the other large-scale productions that surrounded it in its day. Looking back on it now, a decade has passed since I saw this at the theatre although it sure doesn't feel like it at all. 1998 was a high-water mark year for film, unfortunately this film wasn't recognized at all during its release because of the heavy competition. But there was an initial buzz generated about the level of skill concerning the car chase scenes and was another vehicle for the much loved Jean Reno.<br /><br />Ronin has an old world, classic film feel to it. It hits you from the first moments with the headshakingly unnecessary on-screen text of the story of the 47 Ronin, to the slowly fading in of the music, the gothic titles, the low lit caf&eacute; and sullen look on Robert DeNiro's face that seems to be locked in place. Leading the viewer to believe that the protagonist Sam, is sizing up the French Caf&eacute; when the films begins so he can either gun everyone down, or select a target, is the first of a thousand twists to the plot that get unwound, one by one, as the film progresses. David Mamet, who ghost wrote the screenplay and probably thought that it would be a clever idea to go left - each and every time you thought he was about to go right. A lot of negative things can be said about Ronin, but being predictable is not one of them.<br /><br />The dialogue and the interplay between DeNiro and Reno is absolutely believable and the best part the film. Cigarette smoke seems to rise into the air from almost every surface, unshaved faces are peering out from every corner and middle-aged, out-of-work Intelligence Operatives chew on the meager remains of base and amateur criminal activity. DeNiro sleeps in his clothes, Jean Reno chain smokes and looks like he hasn't had a sober day in a lustrum. Ambushing Sean Bean (a guy with probably the most annoying name ever, playing one of the most annoying characters ever) with a cup of coffee is one of my favourite scenes.<br /><br />\\"What's the colour of the boathouse at Hereford?\\"<br /><br />The downfall of Ronin is the downfall that is seen in other movies. The same is attempted in Untamed Heart and also fails just as badly. When any film introduces important characters way-too late in the game, works out the final resolution at a sports event, or employ thuggish looking Russians wearing matching tracksuits and gold chains is usually just too much. Frankenheimer jumped the shark tank here when he introduced the figure-skating angle. Maybe they thought: \\"Hey, this is cool. It's like the terror at the Munich Games in 1972.\\" The problem with that is, is that most people don't remember \\"the terror\\", or they just don't remember the situation at all, so the suspense is completely lost and the scene is too jarring and comes across as out of place. For this portion of the film, it becomes the perfect candidate for a fan edit at faneditdotcom and a deletion of the last twenty-five minutes.<br /><br />As a short aside that might only be important to die hard U2 fans, such as myself, on the album [[ASIN:B000001EAQ Pop]], which came out the year previous, track eight is a song titled \\"Miami\\". This song, according to Bono, was written while he was hanging around on set of Ronin. The lyric \\"What's he got inside the case?\\" is a direct reference to this film and not Pulp Fiction as previously suggested in a few other reviews of the album on Amazon. Just a piece of trivia, that's all.<br /><br />Below I've made a short list of some of the films that came out in 1998. 98 was definitely a good year in cinema, and for the movies that I listed, I probably could've listed several more.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000A7DVR2 The Big Lebowski]]<br />[[ASIN:0780622553 Dark City]]<br />[[ASIN:0783229526 Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas]]<br />[[ASIN:B0006GANPA There's Something About Mary]]<br />[[ASIN:B0001NBLVI Saving Private Ryan]]<br />[[ASIN:6305258287 John Carpenter's Vampires]]<br />[[ASIN:B00000ILEC Waking Ned Devine]]<br />[[ASIN:B00001U0E1 Shakespeare in Love]]<br />[[ASIN:6305428239 Rushmore]]<br /><br />\\"You think you can stitch me up on your own?<br />If you don't mind, I'm gonna pass out.\\"i]]<br />[[ASIN:0780622553 Dark City]]<br />[[ASIN:0783229526 Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas]]<br />[[ASIN:B0006GANPA There's Something About Mary]]<br />[[ASIN:B0001NBLVI Saving Private Ryan]]<br />[[ASIN:6305258287 John Carpenter's Vampires]]<br />[[ASIN:B00000ILEC Waking Ned Devine]]<br />[[ASIN:B00001U0E1 Shakespeare in Love]]<br />[[ASIN:6305428239 Rushmore]]<br /><br />\\"You think you can stitch me up on your own?<br />If you don't mind, I'm gonna pass out.\\"
1592802974|5.0|I'll be the first to admit that I read some pretty dry, boring books. This one is definitely not one of them! I read almost 100% non-fiction, with a high concentration in how-to books and biographies. This book appeals to BOTH of those appetites, AND the interviews totally swept me away in a story-like fashion. To top it all off, I really got some good insights into what successful traders do, and how I can apply that to my own trading/investment style. It doesn't matter that the book is from a different time in the markets, investigating traders who no longer trade, or who are perhaps irrelevant. Human nature evolves very slowly over hundreds of years, and those observations in this book are still dead-on. Jack D. Schwager asks the questions you want answered, and his interviews deliver over and over. An absolute must-read for any investor or trader! As some other reviewers have advised, put your trading accounts on hold until you read this one!
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|I took my boys to see this at the theater.    All I can say (nicely) is that it was the BIGGEST WASTE of 90 minutes we've ever spent at the movies.    I tried to get our money back, but since we watched the entire movie (we kept thinking this HAS to get better) I was SOL.    They should pay people to take this movie off their hands!!!
B000UD0ESA|4.0|The final cut is the version I have been waiting for, with the neato scene where Rutger Hauer does nasty things to Tyrell's eyeballs restored, although I liked the original ending where they discover that Rachel's lifespan has no programmed duration and they go off into the future together with that great Vangelis score ending the movie during the flyover footage.<br /><br />Unfortunately I was hoping for a better DVD transfer.  This is OK but I guess you will have to buy the blu ray version for that.  My upconverting Denon does better with a good transfer.
0307387151|3.0|What is the big fuss over this book? It was a book of prose which really failed to really capture my interest. I only read it to the end because I feel compelled to finish what a book that I have started.    The writer goes into painful descriptions of everything (which really insulted my imagination) and there was barely any dialogue. The story comes through the thoughts of the characters. This would have been fine, but their thoughts strayed way off track. I found myself being confused at certain parts.    Basically, the book is a book filled with fillers, which I guess is just to add the to length of the book.
0312379293|4.0|I would have rated this a 3 plus or 4 minus, but overall I found Archer's latest tome to be fun.  Of course, one must suspend reality in order to accept the whole premise. [Poor man wrongfully accused while the weathy scoundrels \\"get off.\\"  Assuming identities, etc. to attempt to seek revenge.]  I was a big Archer fan many years ago.  Since I've been quite disappointed lately [with other books], I found this one to be very civilized and stylish in a very British manner.  Archer's characterizations are terrific.  Some of his minor players [such as Fraser Munroe, Uncle Hugo & his wife, Alex & his father, the Swiss banker] are just fabulous!  Loved Munroe and the interplay between the father and son lawyers. Reading about the wills was intriguing.[Don't want to spoil  this!]  The description of the jail seemed quite real.  Nick & Danny were likable characters, and, of course, one naturally finds oneself rooting for them.  If you're in the mood for a good romp and are willing to suspend reality, this book will not disapppoint.  I guess this is what is usually called good vacation and/or beach reading.  Absolutely nothing wrong with this.  Could have used better editing, but fortunately Archer is a deft writer.  If this were music, it would be quite lively and definitely not in a minor key.  Unfortunately for me, I love music written in a minor key!  Recommended as light reading -- although the book itself is not so light!

0307387178|5.0|I was taken aback by this book and found it captivating and haunting. I have a son the same age as Chris and debated giving him a copy because its so tempting to sample the taste of tramping while adding huge risk to a young life, but on the other hand see the tempentations of the call of the wlid and how it could call an adventerious young man. The author is supurb at the detail necessary to truly make Chris's actions believeable. This is a book I will think about for a long time.
B000F6IOC0|4.0|One man had two sons. One son, bitten by a bat, became the first vampire, another son, bitten by a wolf, became the first werewolf (lycan). Generations later, there are many vampires and werewolves. There is also a war between the two.  Eventually the son of the werewolf line is captured and locked away till present time. The vampire son arises, mighty and with wings and having the blood of a lycans and thus making him a hybrid. He wants to free his brother, but first he must find Selene (Kate Bekinsale) who is the only living vampire with the memory of where the first Vampire's brother is hiding.... If this sounds all confusing, this is because it is. But, honestly, this is why this film is so much fun, because its mythos is distinct and developed.     I believe most Fantasy lovers will enjoy this film.  There are huge werewolves, disgusting vampires, beautiful vampire of both sexes (I don't want to write to just guys here) and lots of gross gore. I can't imagine where this film series will go if it shoots for this trilogy craze in Hollywood, though I imagine a prequel seems to make the most sense.    Bottom Line: The film is not something you have got to see, however for a break from your usual schedule, or if you just need a little break and want to be entertained, I am certain you will be with this film.

B000QUCNOK|2.0|I read this book my senior year in high school(1986).  I read it only once<br />it took me 2 days and when I saw this movie I immediately knew that they were one in the same.  That is just how INCREDIBLE this BOOK is.  The story is one that would be close to the hearts of those who are disenfranchised by society through no fault of their own.  People are not aware of the desperation  and damage that this sort of long term hopelessness and social isolation can incur. To  read a book where the attributes that made these young girls beloved to all the world actually be the cause of their grisly demise was interesting. The movie is visually LOVELY the costumes and sets are great as well Alan Rickman  is great as always in period pieces(see him in Sweeney Todd).  The difference between the book and the movie.... The book is like eating your favorite food, just the way you like it.  The movie is like eating your favorite food but while you have a bad cold.  It is a muted, less than satisfying version of the real thing
B0002I831S|4.0|As an owner of all 40 of the 2-episode discs, I've always wanted to have all three of the ST:TOS clam-shell sets but bristled at the though of buying something I already had. But with each set presently priced at a reasonable $35-55 each I finally made the leap. Each season set is uniquely packaged in a colored plastic clam-shell case with the DVDs stacked in a clear-plastic holder with a sleeve that I'm sure will not hold up all that well. The insert with content details is a nice touch.<br /><br />Great quality; a bit of a pain as they are not in the order of broadcast. This $35-55 range is fairly reasonable.  But just how many times are they going to release this series?  This is as bad as the Twilight Zone!
B00009V8Z9|5.0|I've always loved the songs I had heard on the radio and I can't beleive I didn't buy this sooner. While Gavin may not be #1 in the charts he deserves the rave reviews he gets.

Gavin went for quality here-This cd doest have the filler songs you will skip over like so many of the mainstream \\"artists\\" out there. If you just want fun but shallow music-this cd isn't for you.
B000P12LWY|4.0|Rome has clearly inspired Showtime to produce this miniseries in 10 one hour parts, portraying Henry VIII's more youthful and vigorous days.  The timespan is a small one, from his growing discontentment with Catherine of Aragon, to consummating his love for Anne Boleyn... so we only get to wife number 2 - plenty of scope for sequels, but did leave me with a bit of frustration at times wanting to see a little more resolved.  As it is, the key players here are Henry VIII, in his low 20's, fighting fit and clearly horny (there are some fairly explicit scenes towards the beginning of the season).. Cardinal Wolsey (played with great presence by Sam Neill) the corrupt but efficient First Minister, and Sir Thomas More, the fervent Catholic and conscientious humanist.  The series thrives on a combination of terrific performances, well written screenplay and flawlessly depicted Tudor atmosphere of the Court.  It falls short of Rome's success by failing to have a counterpoint to the Royal drama - the scenes of `Real' England, the bars and backstreets, are only rarely seen, but could be considered vital to understanding the England of the times.  Having some lowly characters in situations of poverty, may well have helped accentuate the drama.  Having said that, and despite a few forgivable departures from history, this works well as a refresher on Tudor history, and is a first at seeing Henry VIII in his prime as a real human being.  Kudos to Showtime, and I await the next series with bated breath..    Extras are modest, but rewarding - a couple of 5 minute featurettes on costume and sets, and a lengthier one with a tour guide taking us round the real Tudor historic sights in London, all moderately interesting.  A documentary depicting the real history may have also been a welcome addition, but is lacking.  Also included are first episodes on some other Showtime series - a cunning plan, and a welcome one.

They performed at Austin City Limits Festival that year.  I had no idea they have been around since 1998.  DCFC write great lyrics.  Their music is etheral.  \\"Soul Meets Body\\" and \\"Brothers on a Hotel Bed\\" take me on a journey.  Few bands can compare to them.  They have a long career ahead of them.  If you like Coldplay, Travis or Keane, then this band is for you.  I look forward to their new album, Narrow Stairs, in May '08.  Buy this album!  You will not regret it.

B000N6TYLW|5.0|This show is the best show ever this show makes me laugh cry and even think about what is really going on in the persons mind.  i guess we all have our thoughts and ideas of what we like but i know what i like and if i had to pick one show to keep on air forever it would be gilmore girls.  some people hate this show some people but love this show and im one of them. iguess you could say i really connected with the ideas and humor that luren and alexis put out there. season 7 was a great season no doubt but but it was missing something and it was the best writer in the world amy i feel amy is the most talented person in the world and dont forget her wonderful team. i think that seasons 1-6 were the best but i think season 7 put something else out on the table and i think that that is that every little person int that stars hollow is importent to rory and her mom luke and the grand parents even the person who stud in the cornner playing the gatar. Gilmore girls had the best cast and crew ever and i wish they could have stayed and done so things diffrently. like have rory saying no to logan her boyfriend of 3 yrs that is sad i think logan was the best for her he really brought out a diffrent person in rory and i think if the series had continued rory and logan would have gotten back together and married soon rory and logan had been thrugh alot and i think they are perfect for eachother. and in my mind they are happy and  together. the doubble L cupple were ment for eachother to they wenty thrugh eerything even when they werent together. that was cute they both secretly like eachother and all that time they couldve been together.      even know the series ended i could say we are relly lucky that they gave us thoughs 7 yrs to this show and made it witty funny and you know they talk so fast and that is so funny. but i can sat i really felt part of that twon we ccall stars hollow the first time i saw it i knew it would be a hit and i fell in love with it. every laugh brake up death and adventure they took us through and  made it the gilmopre girls we know today i have to sya i will miss turnning on the tv on a tuesday night and say what should i watch and know that empty spot on my t-vo and find out what else to watch. i sware i cryed every minuite of that finally and i sware i still cry. i could watch seasons 1-7 every day and never get boerd and still laugh cry and wonder why they did that though i will miss this spical show i know that in my heart there will always be a place for the gilmore girls and i cant wate to grow up and share my collection with my child and show her my faverate show in the world. i hope the have a tv movie to that would be nice. them all back together again. i sware there will always be a plce for the gilmore girls in my life     THANK YOU FOR THE BEST 7 YRS EVER GILMORE GIRLS !!!!!!!!!!!!
B0013D8LOU|4.0|Being a huge fan of musical theatre, and not so much of a fan of Tim Burton, I was very interested in Sweeney Todd. It looked like something that would be original, interesting and groundbreaking, and for the most part, it is.<br />\\"Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street\\" is a story of Benjamin Barker (Johnny Depp), who is living a happy life with his beautiful wife and baby daughter until a corrupt London aristocrat Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) sets an eye on her. The outcome is tragic, resulting in Barker being in exile for many years, and fueled with angst once he is back in London. He there encounters Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter), who makes the worst pies in London, with whom he starts on a terrifying journey of revenge, under a new name - Sweeney Todd.<br />The plot, atmosphere and the very dark humor of this musical is well-suited for a director like Tim Burton. Although I disagree about him being a great visionary, mostly because all his films are set in the same dark, gloomy environment, this is his best film, simply because of how well the material matches him. The photography, lighting and special effects are all outstanding and perfectly over-the-top. All Tim Burton's films have a sort of a parody feel to it, and \\"Sweeney\\" is no exception. It doesn't take itself too seriously, which is a good thing, because after rivers and rivers of blood you sit through, it requires a lot of comical relief to actually entertain you. The actors are top-notch, especially Helena Bonham Carter, who intentionally underplays her character and delivers a stunning performance. Depp is excellent as per usual, but it seems to me that he needs a nice, normal role for once, just so we can differentiate Sweeney Todd from Willy Wonka from Jack Sparrow.<br />As for the music, it's very enjoyable and fun, but not catchy enough. The actors all have fun with the quick, witty, syncopated rhythm of the music. Stand-out tracks include \\"The Worst Pies In London\\", \\"Poor Thing\\" and \\"Pretty Women\\". Sadly, I don't remember any words to the songs, and I've seen the movie less than 5 hours ago. The problem is, the songs are all to similar, and it seems like Burton dismissed them as an element not too important for the movie, which is a shame. Another thing I found annoying was the ending, which I felt was too rushed and not cathartic enough, neither musically nor story-wise. Other than these two remarks, \\"Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street\\" is a fun, enjoyable movie that will leave Burton's fans amazed by the visuals, and us sheer mortals, by the pitch-perfect Helena Bonham Carter.men\\".

6305648522|1.0|It is baffling how many people loved this movie.   It is astonishing how many have said that it is their favorite movie of all time.  It is a sappy story, but we Americans tend to overlook its many faults, including mediocre camera work, so-so acting, directorial flabbiness, simply because the characters all speak Italian.   Sort of reminds me how the Nouvelle Vague French directors back in the 1960s, e.g., Truffaut, Godard, Chabrol, loved virtually every American movie.  Despite what seems to be an increasing sophistication among moviegoers, there seem to still be a number of people who are entranced by a movie simply because Edith Piaf is on the soundtrack.   There are some truly wonderful Italian movies of the past 20 years but this is not one of them.    Afterword:   I am not surprised to see that no one who has read my review found it \\"helpful\\", to use Amazon's word.   I suspect this means that the readers did not approve of my negativity.  Well, I understand this and some very well-known people have called this their favorite movie of all time.   Just as some people seem to get enjoyment out of watching cars crash at Indianapolis, there are people for whom maudlin works.   Next time (or the first time) you watch this movie, try to look at it for cinematic values rather than whether it makes you sad.  A Big Mac makes me sad and that does not mean it is good

0805079831|5.0|There have been boatloads of books complaining about what's going wrong with economic equality and political power in the world today. This substantial and eye-opening investigation by Naomi Klein easily rises above the pack by constructing a robust political/economic thesis based on easily available sources and historical lessons learned. Klein's theoretical construction is sometimes a stretch (such as the supposed spiritual link between shock therapy in psychiatry and the imposition of economic liberalization on the Third World), and she occasionally lets polemics overtake her arguments.<br /><br />Regardless, this book is a powerhouse of economic investigation and an analysis of deep-seated political trends, showing that economic neoliberalism is not a doctrine but an ideology that brings the same suffering and inequality that comes with all forcibly-imposed governmental systems. Free marketeers, inspired by the late and lionized Milton Friedman, are intellectually and politically unable to see their philosophy's weaknesses and automatically eliminate (politically, and sometimes physically) all who disagree. Just like any unyielding ideology, neoliberalism is self-reinforcing, closed to critique, and convinced of its own infallibility.<br /><br />As Klein shows, there is absolutely no evidence that neoliberalism has been popularly welcomed by any nation's peoples. Instead it has been forced onto unwilling populations by foreign economic institutions and corporate leaders, usually in times of crisis. The result has been the financial and political ruination of several countries, accomplished with the rhetoric of spreading American-style \\"democracy\\" and \\"freedom.\\" But what has really been spread is the right of multinational conglomerates to unregulated profits. This is a travesty of both democracy and capitalism, neither of which has been delivered to the populations that had so-called \\"free market\\" systems forced upon them by a network of extreme economic ideologues.<br /><br />To this book's critics who can only see the world through black-and-white ideological frames: Klein is not condemning capitalism, which is no longer the American economic system, regardless of what pocket-stuffing politicians tell you. Here Klein delivers a devastating condemnation of what is more accurately called corporatism, the unequal and undemocratic mutation of pure capitalism that is now our lot in life, thanks to plutocratic ideologues who enrich themselves while trying to convince those left behind of how \\"free\\" they are. We're next.

0517147688|4.0|I was going to buy the softcover edition of Austen's complete works, but after seeing this hardcover edition, I decided it's a better buy. It's not that much heavier compared to the softcover (surprising as that was one of my concerns), it's beautifully gilded, with ribbon marker attached. The 'leather' covers make it less susceptible to stains. The print is a comfortable size and the paper is thicker than I normally find in these collector type editions so they won't tear or wrinkle easily. The only negative (such a minor one at that) is that the novels are not broken down by volumes. Each of Austen's novels was originally published in 3 volumes. This book bypass that and has continuous chapters instead. Not a big deal really unless you're a purist.

With this new 2008 \\"Legacy Edition,\\" a 2nd disk containing all of the songs performed live in 1973 and 1976 was the latest \\"hook\\" to rack up more sales.  I snuck out of work to purchase it -- my heart racing-- as if I were headed to purchase a brand new CD, rather than something that I've listened to so many times, it's become part of my very core.  Packaging was indeed befitting a \\"deluxe\\" reissue, but, the most surprising thing I would discover is just how great most of the live tracks are:  Ms. King's voice is at its strongest and some of these versions, most notably, \\"Way Over Yonder,\\" are not only better than any prior version, but, they take on all-new power.    While the recorded version of this song was always my least favorite (if such a thing could really ever be said) of the 12 tracks on the original, it's as if you are listening to a freshly written song hearing this latest impassioned liveversion.  The same can be said of the versions of \\"You've Got a Friend\\" and \\"Will You Love Me Tomorrow?\\" -- Carole's singing and piano playing is perfect.      Perhaps the secret lies in the fact that Hank Cicalo, the master engineer of the original studio version of the album, was chosen by Lou Adler to record these live versions.       I don't know why Lou Adler opted not to release these live tracks earlier --inferior live versions of some of these songs appeared on her Carnegie Hall live CD (1996), but, these versions are ther real thing.    So until the next version of this classic album is release --perhaps in 2021 -- it's 50 th anniversary -- these live tracks will keep me satisfied.
0765348276|5.0|I gave this book 5 starts because I really enjoyed it and had a hard time putting down. Having said that, from a more \\"literary\\" angle seems like he could have done more with the contrast between the 75+ year old solders and the special ops troops. Also the combat sections seemed a bit thin - in particular the author describes  being a member of the Colonial Defense Forces as being incredibly difficult and dangerous, but it seems a bit to easy for our hero - maybe a bit too much \\"tell\\" and too little \\"show\\"?
B000KGGLCU|5.0|This CD is definitely worth buying - just for the DVD that comes with it. Fantastic live-show from Pop Queen drifting into dance/club/hip-hop rhythms, with 16:9 aspect ratio and DTS surround sound. Must have - not only for die-hard fans...
0399241957|5.0|My son just turned one and this is his first favorite book!  We've already broken the binding on our first copy (my son gets so excited to point to the gorilla he manhandles the book) so now I'm going to order the box set with the book and the toy gorilla.  This has also become MY favorite kids' book.  It is so clever and I just love the sneaky gorilla character who just wants to snuggle up in bed!  I am still noticing new elements in the pictures after reading it dozens of times.  In the future I will definitely buy this book as a gift.  It is just so darn cute.
B0013FXWU6|5.0|What a great movie, two corrupt Institutions Oil and Church, they are practically bed buddies, Here we have two super egotisctical characters.

B00000D9TQ|1.0|'Cultural Seismology - An attempt to record the shifts and displacements of sensibility that regularly occur in the history of art, literature and thought.'<br /><br />It makes you wonder doesn't it?<br /><br />Phil Collins was/is a member of ancient rock group Genesis, and a releaser of diabolically bad solo music.<br />He is bland and non-descript in a nails-down-a-blackboard, bite-on-cotton-wool sense, and his music contains not one note of interest or revelation to prove otherwise.<br /><br />For years he was in Genesis. What can you say?<br />Genesis, who even by the early 80's, were bitterly embroiled with the Moody Blues in a 'Who's the Deadest Rock Group' competition. Phil apparently became disillusioned and a bit stale so decided to go his own way.<br />Left poor Genesis (who must've been crestfallen), and joined that rather sad little band of going-nowhere monomaniacs - Gabriel, Sting, Weller, McCartney, et al.<br />Folk who sensible people shun like lepers and who should've finished scratching and pecking around the music business DECADES ago.<br /><br />Into this erstwhile company leaps fiery Phil - a 'rocker' with all the threat and endangerment of a King Charles Spaniel.<br />Why isn't he a vicar? The Church wouldn't have him. Imagine being on your deathbed and the Rev Collins coming to give you comfort and succour; \\"Don't call me vicar, just call me Phil...\\" and \\"Miracles CAN happen\\".<br />I believe you Phil....groan.<br /><br />Anyway, you need to show some signs of actually being alive to fight in God's corner and Phil would fail there and then. Listen to his cd: 'Sussidio', 'Two Hearts', 'Easy Lover'. Fibreless. Weak. Tired. Unemotional.<br />Quite clearly, Phil needs SONGS as opposed to nebulous yik-yak, needs dynamite in his arrangements.  Something..anything!<br /><br />'One More Night'. Beyond a joke now. Phil's in the studio, swaying gently to the music. He doesn't realise it's so bad. He'd stop surely? Drums pulse gently when they should fire-crack, lyrics barely exist, weedy strings flutter away in the background...you get the picture. Lethargic. Small. Underwhelming.<br /><br />This stuff is ruthlessly exploitative as well, scientifically aimed at middle aged housewives doing the hoovering, who don't want anything too demanding, or they'll get a migraine.<br />It's stubbornly inward looking, a pompous slop-rock ghetto. A niche, a mono-directional phenomenon, an artistic void, destined for the barren Woolworths shelves...<br /><br />Nothing on 'Hits' is good or even mildly diverting. There's a dramatic chord change towards the end of 'Groovy Kind of Love' that threatens to rescue the whole song, but, ahh hopes are dashed and we're soon back on the snoozy track to the rocking chair and oblivion. So close there Phil...<br /><br />There seems to be a mad, spurious trust between Phil and his audience. I'd imagine it's the same kind of thing Daniel O'Donnell has with his. A we-won't-do-anything-awry understanding, beginning in earnest and ending in Switzerland.<br /><br />Maybe some-one should give old Phil a gentle nudge, tell him Justin Heyward's just released an lp. That'd get him going...perhaps.<br />Perhaps he could do a tour, a triple header with Twinkle and Alvin Stardust. Or he could just sleep, bless him. Pop's dreariest man looks (and sounds!) weary.

0143038419|5.0|Most readers will be well rewarded if they hang in through the initial whining.  The author embarks on a true journey of self discovery.  She is witty, insightful and she delivers with a first-class prose style.  Is she narcissistic?  Definately, but so what?  She eventually gets around to helping someone besides herself.  There is much to be gleaned from joining her in her travels.  Enjoy!
B0014EAN8K|3.0|For a series of movies built off of a horror video game, Resident Evil has been an enjoyable ride.    Too bad this version has so many people who have supposedly survived for literally years in a world gone to hell making so many horribly bad life & death decisions.    Biggest gripe was with how the movie seemed to dumb down the returning characters to fit the \\"plot\\" they developed for this flick rather than raising the stakes to meet up with the characters they chose to revisit.    Poor L.J., not my favorite character, has my sympathy in this outing as yet another abused stereotype when he should have gotten the \\"heroic sacrifice\\" role that was given to Carlos.
B0014Z4OQG|5.0|See what people dont understand about this movie is that it had a huge viral marketing campaign. I mean more than any movie I've ever seen. Fake websites, fake broadcasts of monster attacks on offshore oil rigs. Just tons and tons of stuff. I would say 85% of the people who watched this movie had no idea about this. It's what made the movie so awesome. The shaky cam isn't nearly as bad as everyone says. How many hours of youtube videos have you watched? So don't complain about a shaky cam. This is the best monster movie out since I watched Godzilla back in the day. Also the most original movie I've seen in FOREVER.     Pros: Viral Marketing to the extreme        Most original movie to be released in theaters I've seen in years        The situation is realistic. People die. Get over it.        The monster is awesome!    Cons: Extras should include the entire marketing campaign of the film.         When will that second film get here?! Not fast enough.    If you are a monster movie lover and actually LIKE originallity then watch this film. For everyone else, why would you give it bad reviews if you dont know hardly anything about the film? RESEARCH!
1400063515|5.0|Taleb's main point here is that we should be extremely cautious about making predictions in nonlinear systems, as well as believing such predictions when we hear them.  Unfortunately, most of the systems where we really want to know what will happen in the future are nonlinear systems--including all of human society, and the economy in particular. Taleb does a great job punching holes in the pretentiousness of \\"experts.\\"<br /><br />Although Taleb doesn't mention this, I would like to point out that the most accurate method known for predicting the performance of the economy is to say that tomorrow will be like today, next month will be like this month, and next year will be like this year.  Of course this method of \\"prediction\\" is absolutely useless when something unexpected happens. And as Taleb's book points out, something unexpected always happens.

B00006I53S|3.0|First, I should point out I'm an amatuer. This is my first lens for my Canon Rebel XTI. I purchased this lens on Amazon over a year ago, and although I have no other lens to compare this to - I am dissapointed. Here's why:     - I read a few reviews indicating that this lens could be your \\"only\\" lens - good for all purpose. I have to disagree. I am often frustrated by the limited 135MM range. Especially for landscape shots. Now, if I knew how to crop/ photoshop/ etc., perhaps this wouldn't be as big an issue for me. In retrospect, I wish I had purchased a telephoto lens with 300MM range and purchased the basic lens that came with the Xti for short-range photos.     - I was warned that the lens was heavy, but I thought hey - I'm 6'3, pretty strong - no big deal. However, now I wish I had gone with a lighter lens. The lens is heavy and makes carrying around your camera all day a little less appealing. For a casual photographer who wants good shots, I have to imagine there is a decent quality lighter lens out there for less money (however, I admit I have no idea yet if that's true!).     - I find that about 20% of my shots are a bit blurry. I attribute this to being an amatuer, but I never had this problem with less sophisticated \\"point-and-shoot\\" cameras. Is it possible I'm doing something wrong?? Probably. But again, I'm writing this as an amatuer, so if you're like me, perhaps there's a better lens out there (or maybe not - I'll have to try another one and find out!)    In summary, although I have no major complaints with this lens, I was dissapointed after reading all the glowing reviews. I am now considering purchasing the Canon EF 70-300mm f/4-5.6 IS USM Lens OR the 70-200mm f/4L IS USM Autofocus Lens. I plan on trying them both out at a local camera store before purchasing - especially since I want to make sure I get \\"enough zoom\\" in my next lens.     Good luck with your purchase!

B00008S2VG|5.0|In short, this album is incredible. Did I like it when it first came out? No ... 5 years later, I appericate it more now than ever. Her meaning is deep, the energy is raw and it's unlike anything she's done before. (surprise, surprise) Absolute Standouts are: the hopeful \\"Intervention,\\" the engergic \\"Nobody Knows Me,\\" and the beautiful \\"Nothing Fails,\\" which I think is one of the best ballads I've ever heard her do, and the first time I listened to it, it left me breathless. 5 years later, the title, American Life, just about says it all. Bravo - A+

0066620996|5.0|I have owned this book on CD since '03 and just this year purchased the hardcover edition. Through his teams research and analysis, Jim Collins has constructed a potentially timeless classic for business people and leaders. GTG will add to your professional talents, it is inspiring and compelling for those of us that border on obsession with our professional lives. This book has helped me to hire and fire. I revisit it regularly for inspiration. GTG is truly an investment in your own future. If you can apply the techniques written about here you will see a difference in the quality of the life for you and those that you work with daily. The simple concepts of first who, then what and the hedgehog, bring a simplistic and valuable way to approach our day to day challenges. Those very simple core values of GTG leaders are easy to articulate but very difficult to practice and execute consistently. Once mastered they are very powerful and rewarding. Time spent with GTG will certainly provide a return. Don't wait any longer. Your thoughts and opinions are always welcome.
0974869449|5.0|I am very satisfied with these cards- they are of a decent cardstock and as such, have been pretty sturdy.  They really are exceptional.  A good number of the cards have mnemonics on them, which is great to help you remember the core meaning of the kanji.  There is a lot of good information on these cards, so they will be helpful regardless of your stage of learning.  My only complaint would be regarding the mnemonic pictures- I wish ALL of the cards had them!  A good number of them do though, and sometimes a kanji needs to be learned just as they are, I suppose.  Otherwise, I would say these are great, portable and sturdy flashcards that will help you learn regardless of where you are in your Japanese language journey!
B00014TJ7K|5.0|When I was a baby , my mother brought home an album that would begin my love for music, the album was \\"All things must pass\\" , little did either one of us know was it would be mine at the young age of six , it was an album that never left me and I still listen to it now and even during my teen years in th eighties when it wasn't cool by my peers to listen to such a relic at that time. So lets go back to 1987 the year of the release of \\"Cloud Nine\\". I was 17 and it was to be my senior year of high school onward to 1988 , this was a Xmas present from a friend , and not only was this great , this album too stuck with me . these songs bring back so many memories this would be the soundtrack to my final year of high school , as well as a farewell to those things at that time that \\"MUST PASS AWAY\\". George truly shined on this album and it was a shame he was never again to repeat such an effort. Now I am preparing for my 20 year high school reunion, where I will truly be a \\"Fish out of sand\\", with memories of a girl I will have my mind set on, and if \\"just for one night\\" my old friends and I regroup like \\"We were Fab\\", then like the music of this album I will truly be on \\"CLOUD NINE\\".

B0002PZVHK|5.0|Truly, when \\"Ambient 4: On Land\\" was first released in 1982, it was decades ahead of its time, or even, as another reviewer here described it , \\"timeless\\". \\"Ambient 4\\" can be said to have been the shape of ambient to come in the way it abandons all clear instrumentation and obvious melody to reach an ultimate goal: simulating a virtual, fictional world.  Spacial effects and panning give the listener the sense bring the listener beyond the point of being reminded of an environment and into the realm of feeling as if they are there.  \\"On Land\\" abandons the new age ideal of music for the functional purpose of relaxation, and also doesn't seem intended to be used as a backdrop for daily activities, as it rewards focused listening.<br /><br />The place \\"On Land\\" will take you to is green of all shades, all hues, typically paler and interwoven with grey.  Everything lies overgrown, not far from civilization but uncontrolled by it, possessing all the wildness and unpredictability of a deep forest...  typically safe, often unnerving in its bizarreness, occasionally truly threatening.  You will get wet and most likely dirty.  There are moments of greater unease, such as the almost human, gasping voice of \\"Shadow\\" and the dark murkiness of \\"Lantern Marsh\\", as well as the sense one gets when exploring a potentially dangerous place against better judgment, driven by simple curiosity. The best example of this is in the misty fog and overcast weather of \\"Unfamiliar Wind (Leeks Hills)\\".  There is a general sense of melancholy hanging over most of the record, like that of a cold morning lacking in bright sunlight.<br /><br />There are modern ambient artists who you'd swear were working in surround sound even on the puniest of stereo systems (Coil, Lustmord, Steve Roach), and yes, the production of \\"On Land\\" lacks the clarity and separation of their work.  However, in terms of sheer creativity and vision-inspiring power, \\"On Land\\" stands the test of time, and is one of the all time greats of the genre.  Highly recommended.nre.  Highly recommended.
B000J4QWMC|3.0|With expectations running high for this cinematic treatment of a cultural icon of 1980s television, there was bound to be some controversy surrounding Michael Mann's 2+ hour widescreen extravaganza. Lurking somewhere beneath the breathtaking but drawn out scenes, and the occasional longeurs as the action went slack, there is probably a four-star movie. What Mann needed was something more of an internal censor and some deft editing to trim the fat.    Other viewers have tended to stress the differences between the TV series and this movie. As far as I'm concerned, the film picks up on alot of the series: in mood, this is close to Season 3 of the TV show, when, much to its benefit, the small screen series went serious and gritty, producing some of its most consistent plotlines and drama. Unfortunately, the movie suffers from a need for taut editing and transitions, something that plagued the first season of the series. Mann seemed to get the knack as the series went on, but here he's back to the scenes that linger just a bit to long, and transitions that come along with a whimper instead of a bang. This can be excused once or twice, but add this up over more than 120 minutes and you the viewer are catching on to the fact that with some judicious post-production attention, this could have been more riveting, and pared down to about 1hr 45mins without losing the dramatic thread.    Jamie Foxx and Colin Farrell slip into their roles as Crockett and Tubbs with considerable stature. Foxx's Tubbs has been reworked from the series version with Philip Michael Thomas, with positive results. Foxx seems tough and intense, every bit Farrell's equal (Thomas's Tubbs, and his too-cool-for-school persona, verged on the annoying, and he was definitely second fiddle to Don Johnson). Sadly, there is more slackness in the movie's lack of a backstory. In the series, we know that Tubbs' brother had been killed in New York at the hand of drug lord he would battle off and on in Miami. Crockett, too, had some history of his own, and several bad girlfriend situations. If this movie was hell-bent on exceeding two hours, it could have been filled with something that makes us connect with our two good guys. As it was, I left the film not really caring what happened to any of the principals.    In sum, this is a visual treat that showcases some of Michael Mann's talents. If you are new to this franchise, check out the series first. It will help you project some care and concern for the two main players, something - sadly - the movie fails to accomplish on its own.    The DVD package is a nice presentation, filled with some meaty 'making-ofs' and interviews. There's a good commentary by Mann to round things out. These bonus features are a plus, and probably made the difference between passing this off to a second-hand outlet and keeping it in my collection.

B0013D8LOU|3.0|I just started watching the movie.    I immediately have a major complaint - the sound ... it is horribly mixed ... the music is often too lound to hear what the characters are singing or saying.  The voices are too soft a good bit of the time.  The background music is too loud.      Unless you have a system where you can set a max sound level and it equalizes it out you will spend the entire movie adjusting the volume up and down to compensate either for the horrendously loud music or the horribly soft voices.    Twenty minutes in I am close to declaring this thing unwatchable!

B0014CQNTK|4.0|Love the movie, which I've seen both in a theater and on the DVD.  I was a fan of Ellen page when seeing her earlier effort in \\"Hard Candy\\".  She should have a very successful future in films with that kind of talent.      I spent the extra money for the \\"Special Edition\\", only to find that disk two was blank. The same result was obtained when I inserted the disk in my computer's DVD drive. I returned to the store where I purchased it and exchanged it for another of the same edition.  Same result.  Needless to say, I was, and am, very unhappy.  I went to the Fox Searchlight Pictures web site and found that they have no facility for feedback, except for items purchased through their online store.  There is no phone number, no physical address, no e-mail address, etc.  I guess they don't want to hear the bad news.  If you have had similar results, it would suggest that this problem extends beyond the Houston store where I purchased this product.  The company should recall the \\"Special Edition immediately and fix the problem before duping any more people into spending their hard-earned money on a defective product.

B000EGFVQS|3.0|A vivacious, intelligent 14 year old girl is raped and murdered on her way home from school by a creepy neighbor. She dies and goes to heaven and recounts the tale from there. She watches her family struggling and trying to deal with the tragedy from the police investigation that immediately follows up until years afterwards when her siblings are grown up and their parents age. I feel that it started out great though rather harshly and boldly and I was not surprised to hear the author herself was a victim of rape. No-one else could have written a rape scene so vividly and painfully, in other words so well. The premise for heaven was interesting and different than anything else I have ever encountered but however, when the story shifts from the investigation and the narrator's struggle to adjust to life in heaven and the struggle on earth for those left behind and moves to a biography of her family, the book loses a lot of flavor and cohesion. However, all in all, it's a worthwhile read.

B0013D8LOU|3.0|Tim Burton is right on his game for this adaptation of this musical; in fact, if you've seen 'Edward Scissorhands', 'Batman' or 'Sleepy Hollow', you've probably seen \\"Sweeney Todd.\\"  The dark palette Burton uses elsewhere is back and bleaker than ever (so the blood stands out, natch), with some choice CGI thrown in for good measure.  The visual effects are so overwhelming, in fact, that they almost represent another character in the film, and while occasionally this raises a film into the classic realm (see 'Schindler's List', 'Brazil' or 'Amadeus' for key examples), in this case, the dreary lack of color here actually mutes many of the performances.  Certainly the biggest character revelation in the final act of the film is tainted by Burton broad-stroking gloom and doom over every frame.<br /><br />Sondheim is a clever composer, but 'Todd' runs high on shock and low on substance, paling before 'Into the Woods', 'Sunday in the Park With George' (which did wordplay far superior) and even large sections of 'Dick Tracy.'  Unfortunately, Helena is solid and fun, but no great shakes and Johnny seems content to sing with a nasally David Bowie (think 1960s Bowie) tone.<br /><br />All of these factors conspire to make 'Todd' a good musical, when it could have been a great musical.

0670018651|2.0|Enjoyment of this book depends less on your interest in perfume than in your attitude towards nastiness.  People love it or hate it for the same reason -- it's nasty.  I would characterize the composition as follows:  \\"top notes of breezy and acerbic wit fade quickly to reveal a heart of relentless nastiness over an oppressive base of condescension and narcissism.\\"    Suitable for:  those who love cheap shots and sneering at people who wear \\"Light Blue\\".  Also perfect for those who would prefer to please Luca Turin rather than their own lover.    Not suitable for:  those who appreciate detailed analysis or consider objectivity essential to legitimate criticism. Also inappropriate for those disinclined to drive off a cliff if directed to do so by their GPS.

B000002UAC|5.0|Just for the covers alone, this record is worth the price of admission.  The soulful \\"You Really Got A Hold On Me\\" along with \\"Please Mr. Postman\\" and \\"Money\\" are some of the best tracks on the record.  While \\"Till There Was You\\" foreshadowed McCartney's talent as a balladeer.  Pity these gems don't get more airplay on the radio, but I guess that's why we have CD players.  Enjoy!
B00001OH82|4.0|Even by the standards of the chameleon-like David Bowie this was an unexpected move: eschewing his increasingly mainstream solo career, forming a hard-rock band to play in small clubs, and recording an album that was less about 'concept' and more about improvisation. That he did so at the end of the 1980s makes it doubly surprising: the sound Tin Machine generated was, depending on how you look at it, 10 years too late or 5-10 years too early. After all, 1989 was the year in which the biggest hits were a weepy from Phil Collins and a power ballad from The Bangles. Enough said. But Bowie always seems to be standing outside of time, when he isn't utterly defining it, so that's hardly a surprise. What is surprising is that the first album that grew out of this experiment was and still is a tremendously enjoyable one. Playful, sharp, by turns stirring and dark, these are 14 hard-rock tracks about love, fame and especially drugs. Energetic guitarist Reeves Gabrels playfully pulls out a dozen classic rock riffs and then invents a few more. The Sales brothers' rhythm section is superb. As always, Bowie's vocals are top-notch. Tim Palmer's production and mixing are a good match for the band: the sound is exceptionally crisp and clear; I like the depth, and the fact that the vocal isn't always foregrounded; Gabrels is clearly the star here, but his playing isn't allowed to overwhelm the others. The surprise hit single \\"Under the God\\" still stands up today, as does most of the album. Other standout tracks include \\"Prisoner of Love\\" and a particularly savage cover of John Lennon's \\"Working Class Hero\\". What I like most about this album is that it sounds like four exceptionally skilled rock musicians having fun together. They don't really care what's popular. They don't really care if we listen. They're just doing what they enjoy - and that always plays.
B000ICLRIE|3.0|I love this movie, but am sad that the Blu Ray edition lacks the same incredible packaging the standard ed Director's cut received as a 4 disc set.  Why is it that the Blu Ray discs are significantly more expensive  and yet the packaging is far less than standard editions...  I can only hope in the next 2 years the demand for Blu Ray puts them on firm equal  footing with standard DVDs

B000E41MS6|4.0|There are many great reviews here that go into detail about the show.  And I agree with almost all of them: Doctor Who is a terrific show--fast, fun, and full of wonder.  But let me talk for minute about the price of these sets.<br /><br />As you probably already know, a season (or \\"series\\" if you like) of Doctor Who runs 13 hour-long episodes.  That's just over half the length of a season of most American one-hour shows, which usually are comprised of 22 or 24 episodes.  When you consider that a large majority of American series' full-season sets are priced at under $50, it seems hard to justify the pricetag for these BBC shows.<br /><br />\\"But Doctor Who is so much BETTER than those other shows!\\" you might exclaim.  And I'd have to more or less agree, although there are exceptions such as moderately-priced sets for THE X-FILES or BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER.  I can only hope we will soon see a price drop, as was the case with some of the STAR TREK series.<br /><br />I love Doctor Who, but I'm holding out a better deal.
0761944524|5.0|I love this book. It covers everything from the most basic t-tests and ANOVAs to factor analysis.  It tells you the basics of what the test is meant to do, what sort of data is appropriate for it and it tells you how to actually run and read the test in SPSS.<br /><br />It isn't the best book for someone who wants a detailed explaination of how to calculate a statistical test by hand and it doesn't give extensive detail on the assummptions required for each test.  Nonetheless, it's a great quick reference book, particularly if you've already had a statistics course and you just need a refresher. Graduate students will find it useful.

0805079831|2.0|I looked forward to reading Naomi Klein's \\"The Shock Doctrine\\" because I thought it would explain why the last quarter century's triumph of free market economics has caused so much hardship.  Her thesis is compelling; she argues that back in the seventies, governments working with Chicago School (read Milton Friedman) exploited or instigated a \\"shock\\" that served as an excuse or tool to raid the underclasses economic and political protections and to transfer that wealth to fund the expansion of corporate control and growth to the immense gain of the powerful and wealthy.  She shows how this was done in countries such as Chile, Argentina, Poland, Russia, South Africa, the UK, the US and Iraq.<br /><br /> She makes a couple of important points.  First, that the idea that political freedom creates the conditions necessary for economic freedom or the reverse is nonsense.  And that governments are easily persuaded to throw the vast majority of its citizens under the bus in order to stimulate corporate growth favoring the rich all the while claiming it will trickle down to everyone.<br /><br /> But she frequently over-reaches her evidence and implies connections that she doesn't prove. Klein only examines the Chicago school economics from the standpoint of its political goals; anti-Keynesian and anti-development.  Her summary of the their economic theories is extremely reductive and dismissive.  Its as if she is saying that engaging their economic ideas isn't important because she is only interested their impact.  But it made this reader believe she never made a good faith effort to understand any of their ideas.<br /><br /> Even worse, she starts the book with a chapter that explains how the CIA funded a psychiatrist, Dr. Ewen Cameron, to perform tortuous experiments on his patients that produced a shock in his victims so as to make them psychologically helpless.  This chapter is meant metaphorically as a way to show how this process could happen on a societal scale.  Her next chapter as a way of introducing Friedman and the Chicago School is entitled, \\"The Other Doctor Shock.\\"  The implication being that Friedman was responsible for political repression and violence that the regimes he counseled inflicted on their citizens.  Yet for proof she points only to his defensiveness when critics made this claim about his economic policies.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of Friedman or the Chicago school but I don't think that \\"The Shock Doctrine\\" plays fair.  If she has evidence that part of their economic agenda was political repression then Klein needs to produce it.  If not, then drop the \\"shock and torture\\" language.  The related problem which stems from her cavalier treatment of economics is that the national examples she uses are very different in many ways and yet she reduces complex historical, economic and political events to the same pattern; the imposition of radical, free market economics through a \\"shock\\" that destroys the society's safety net and throws the majority of citizens into economic hardship.  I don't know the histories of all these countries but her reductive approach feels like she is more interested in proving her point than in being honest about the facts.s a way of introducing Friedman and the Chicago School is entitled, \\"The Other Doctor Shock.\\"  The implication being that Friedman was responsible for political repression and violence that the regimes he counseled inflicted on their citizens.

0634049011|5.0|MI's Guitar Fretboard Workbook, written by: Barrett Tagliarino is the second  workbook I have studied out of.  I immediately noticed how the pictures and diagrams were so intuitive.  It took a lot less effort to memorize the concepts simply because they made much more sense.  Tagliarino removed the mystery, and immediately made it easy for me to grasp, and memorize the five root shapes with his diagram in the workbook. Ultimately this is why I bought a workbook like this in the first place.  Great job, Barrett!    I do not know this author.  Just really like his book.     -Shane
B0000DZ3EN|5.0|I first saw this movie around six years old. I know most people would advise against that, but I was entranced. I had been in love with the Oz story since age two, and seeing Return To Oz was inevitable. It is definitely a frightening movie, but for me, I think because I had just gone through the death of my sister, it was very therapeutic. I identified with Dorothy's struggles and the dark cloud hanging over her  home.     I am amazed, watching it now, at the sheer quality of the film technically, the animatronics and claymation are incredible. (I really believe you couldn't get much better quality today even with the high-tech effects available. It is also worthy to note that the occasional place in the movie where you notice the special effects creates a deeper connection to it--a connection much harder to receive with the over-glossy special effects of today.)     The score gives me chills every time I hear it--it is beyond brilliant. Looking at the types of instruments this movie used--I realize how much it shaped my evolving musical tastes (such as the lute-like instrument used by Mombi and the violin singing the main theme).     I loved the Oz books by L. Frank Baum and I have always appreciated the care the produders and director took to bring his vision to the screen. I love the Judy Garland version, but Return to Oz captures the heart and soul of the books.     I highly recommend this film--to children seven and up (with discretion), and any adults interested in children's literature or fantasy. It's themes are family oriented, and it truly expresses a childlike heroism in a humble and haunting way.
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|I was listening to XM Radio station 'Squizz' at work when I heard this band for the very first time.  Why don't they get airplay on regular radio???!!!  The song was \\"Watch Over You\\".  I fell in love with the singer right there at my desk.  His beautiful voice sent a chill right through me.  I went home & searched for them and found the 2 cds and downloaded that song & Rise Today which I had also heard on Squizz.  I listened to a few other samples, one of which was \\"Down to My Last\\" and was hooked.  Downloaded that and also bought both cds.  I don't think they sound like Creed, in fact I didn't know they had been in Creed (I have 2 Creed cds from when they first came out)....I think they have their own sound and I love it.  I think if you like Incubus (another band I discovered on Squizz...where have I been?!!!!), you'll love Alter Bridge, and I only compare the 2 because that guy also has that voice that makes you feel like he's exposing his very soul...just to you. Love it!  I hope they put another cd out soon! They are definitely in my top 3 (with Disturbed & Linkin Park).
1400049628|5.0|But will you be laughing when there's your undead neighbor chewing on your brain? I didn't think so. Get this book. Read it. Memorize it. Prepare. You never know when there could be some sort of \\"virus\\" outbreak. I'd rather be prepared then be the one's without a plan.
B00070Q8DQ|5.0|Behemoth is the heaviest, most brutal, and most awesome band out of Poland. they are currently one of the best, if not THE BEST, death metal bands out there, playing a sort of blackened DM with absolutely awesome riffs, drumming, and vocals and a sort of melodic contour evoking ancient pre-Christian lands of Sumer, Babylon, and Egypt. Nergal has traveled to a lot of interesting places and i think he has absorbed good inspiration. _Demigod_ is another astonishing release in a catalogue that has been producing amazing black metal and death metal for years now. It is not easy to say why they are so amazing --the blastbeats of drummer Inferno will reduce your bones to powder; the vocals also seem different from most death metal out there, rather than drawn out growls, it sounds like an intense, abrasive cross between singing, yelling, and growling through a throat choking on blood, with lots of multitracking; and the riffs are simply breathtaking and remarkably intricate melodically. But to enumerate reasons for Behemoth's overall greatness seems impossible with a \\"reductionist\\" method. _Demigod_ is just a sick rush from beginning to end, and though most of the songs are not long, by sound and grandeur and insane power there are few things more epic sounding in metal. And the band just comes out of the speakers like they want to kill me...as in personally cut my up with an axe or something! That kind of threatening musical power is priceless. Little touches (the heavy and ominous instrumental intro to \\"The Reign of Shemsu-Hor\\", the background leads of the \\"Towards Babylon\\", acoustic leads of \\"Sculpting the Throne ov Seth\\" and \\"Nephilim Rising\\", the opening fanfare to the title-track, fer example) add both atmosphere and extra EVIL. So crazy, it almost incited me to rip pages out of my Bible, but it is an important and interesting historical document so I restrained myself. Listen to _Demigod_ at punishing volumes, and BEHEMOTH shall be the name of your destroyer.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|three generations watched this in absolute awe.   wonderful and i recommend it to anyone. it is so beautiful that words do no justice.
0307237699|4.0|Last summer decided to do a 'political' summer thing (all presidential hopefuls books). Really enjoyed this one the most, and decided to pick up the author's first book. I felt it was an easy read, wasn't patronizing to the readers and didn't speak 'at' the reader. Good read nothing to racey and could be enjoyed by a teenager looking for something different for a summer read.
B000AGTPUU|5.0|I LOVE this movie!  I could watch it 10 times in one day and not even get tired of it!  It was heartwarming and my favorite Christmas movie.  I think it is great for all ages.  If you are thinking about buying this stop thinking and just buy it!  I love this movie (I think I've said that enough) I watched it a year ago on the T.V. and when Christmas came around and I couldn't stop watching it!  Heartwarming movie about believing in Santa Claus and also about being in the North Pole!
B000YABYLA|5.0|I can't lose lately. Only running into a couple of stinkers here and there like \\"The Mist\\", but this year I get \\"No Country For Old Men\\", \\"There Will Be Blood\\", and now Juno. This is the sweetest, smartest comedy/love story I've seen in...I don't know how long. Awesome soundtrack, great actors, just great great great. If you didn't like this movie just a little, you are a sad, sad, retarded person with severe taste deficiencies, and you probably like to project your own sorry life onto the characters and criticize them for their choices, just like you do with every other movie you watch. Oh, well. The rest of us will enjoy it for you.
B000H5U832|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie, it was heartwarming.  I even cried (yeah I know I'm weak) but its very good!  I love how everybody in the little town has their own little shop and their personality but they all get along.  Okay well heres my summary:<br />  Lightening McQueen is a rookie and doing great, him and 3 other cars tie a race.  So as a tie breaker they have another race in I think California.  So as Mac (McQueen's truck) is driving him to the race he falls asleep and McQueen goes out.  He ends up by himself and drives and he ends up in Radiator Springs where he makes friends and learns a huge secret!  And then watch the ending for yourself, I recommend it and trust me I'm alittle older so all age levels will love this movie!
B000092ZYX|5.0|I remember when this came out I was a young buck and my musical tastes, as always, were rapidly changing. I was just coming out of a period were I was into bands like Godsmack and Three Days Grace and Papa Roach and other bands of the like that I am now extremely embarressed to associate myself with. Hail to the Thief was the first Radiohead CD, aside from a live one which I don't count, that I ever heard. I used to listen to it while I cleaned my barracks room or played Ghost Recon with my friend. I didn't get it the first half dozen times I listened to it and then gradually I started liking it more and more. I can honestly say that this album just gets better and better with each listen, and I have probably listened to the whole album about 50 times now. Now, I am not prone to hyperbole normally, but this is a masterpiece. I have read other critics who don't like the dissenence or the praise that radiohead gets. I, however, as a songwriter, know how easy it is to get trapped into playing tonic, 4th, 5th, and minor 6th based songs, since theory is set in stone and those 12 notes between ocaves, and their intervals, and the laws of harmony are more or less set in stone. So it is really refreshing to find Chopin's, Beethoven's and in my opinion, Radioheads - musicians who can make amazing, unique, listenable music with odd intervals. Not to mention the incredible rhythms that sound like a map of a dream. And to top that all off is Thom Yorke's amazing surreal lyrics.  I think my first love was of Mxysamatosis. I can't go into the specific lines of lyric that are outstanding because I would be writing all night. This album is also a concept album in that it is unified by a theme and works better being listened to as a whole album than just a song here and there, although certain songs can be enjoyed outside the frame of the album, such as There, There. You may ask what theme is it? To which I would reply, to me, it's dreamish, and haunting. It reminds me the oxymoronof feeling smart and different and completely isolated from everyone else because of ackward social skills. This album has gotten flak from my friends for being pretentious. It is not pretentious at all. I don't know how anyone could honestly believe that. I certainly know that some musicians use different intervals and rhythms for the sake of being different, which I don't know whether I should think that's bad or good. But this album definetly does not that fit that category. Listen to it and you know that there is no other way to express Radiohead's soul than this complex sound. It is complex by nature, not by virtue of being complex. This album has been there for me in so many good and bad times of my life and has never failed to make me feel amazing. I remember reading M. Ward on the linear notes of a John Fahey album talking about if it was possible to have a significant moment in one's life, comprable to a first love, or the death of a parent, by hearing an album. I think every music fanatic knows that this is most definetly true, and this album along with Miles Davis's Kind of Blue, John Fahey's Yellow Princess stands as one of the pillars of my musical foundation. I can not imagine my life without this album.
0446693804|4.0|I was very excited to read this book, I enjoyed it.  Sometimes it was like Landon would trail off of the story at the very beginning but then as it goes on you see that he trails off to introduce the characters and make it more heart-warming and tear-jerking.  I never really had any tears but it was tear-jerking.  Good characters and a great ending (I wasn't expecting it!)
0307265730|3.0|Lahiri is a skilled storyteller.  Her detailed descriptions and choreography of characters across time and place demonstrate her writing talent.  At the same time, her frequent failure to develop characters we grow attached to - historically often the hallmark of great storytellers and writers - makes me question where her accolades originate from.  Though, it's not as if there is no potential.  I read 'Interpreter' when it first came out and was impressed.  However, at that time the Indian immigrant story was a new genre, and Lahiri was a strong cut above the rest. Following the wave of the recycled 'immigrant struggle' story, I bypassed her first novel, 'Namesake', altogether and from what I heard I didn't miss much.  I turned to this, her newest book, after some convincing.  Unaccustomed earth was good enough to make hard to put down but still left me wanting.    I was left wondering why such a strong writer does not wish to, by her third book, use her ability to evoke emotion through her characters' personal relationships to also evoke a sense of familiarity among readers whose principal interactions are with people other than ivy-league graduates, upper class whites, white collar professionals, and globe trotters?  This would bother me less, since Lahiri is probably fully concious of her character choices, if the media did not cast Lahiri as the authority on the Indian-American experience.  The experience is so much larger than that which Lahiri portrays (including among Bengalis), yet her non-immigrant audience almost co-opts her writing to represent what they are comfortable with.  None of the political ugliness that non-immigrant America needs to contend with is unearthed in Lahiri's work.    Strong stories in the book include 'Hell-Heaven' (which also appeared in the New Yorker around 2002) and 'Only Goodness'.  'A Choice of Accomodations' and 'Nobody's Business' much less so.  The best part of this book comes in part two, the 'Hema and Kaushik' trilogy.  This second part reveals what Lahiri is capable of.  Her writing strength is on display here, as is her ability to build bonds between characters and readers.  She connects readers to not only the immigrant experience, but complex personal emotions and contemporary events and phenomena that have shaped both immigrants' and non-immigrants' lives.  It also has a stronger ending than many of the other stories in the book.  Her accomplishment here leaves me wondering why she sacrifices so much in some of her other stories.  The media's focus on her work actually does her harm in the end.  It sets up unrealistic expectations for an otherwise solid writer.  If Lahiri were to write an entire novel that captured the range of ability, emotions, and relevance as the 'Hema and Kaushik' trilogy, she could then righfully claim all that she has already been afforded.
B0001US62I|4.0|Angel Heart is what director Alan Parker envisioned a brilliant mixture of Raymond Chandler film noir mixed with the Gothic and occult. Mickey Rourke in one of his best performances plays Harry Angel. Angel is a private investigator very low on the food chain in Brooklyn. He only gets work based on his last name starting with the letter A. However a mysterious and dangerous businessman named Louis Cyphre (Robert De Niro) finds him and contracts him to track down a crooner from the thirties named Johnny Favorite. All Cyphre will tell Angel is that Favorite owes him big for a deal that was struck before Johnny hit it big. Cyphre wants to collect because he doesn't like \\" messy accounts.\\" Cyphre isn't sure if Johnny is still \\"amongst the living\\" since no one has seen him in over twelve years when one night he got in a car and disappeared. Angel begins his investigation in New York but soon relocates to New Orleans when it is obvious that the people behind Johnny's disappearance are heavily involved in voodoo and the occult. In New Orleans he meets Epiphany (Lisa Bonet) the daughter of a woman rumored to be Johnny's lover who is now dead. Epiphany has her own strange connection to Johnny and to voodoo as well but her and Angel begin a relationship. Cyphre comes to town and pretty soon Angel discovers what Cyphre really wants  and who he really is. This film is so atmospheric and has so many unusual shots that it really does get to you. Rourke is fantastic considering his lack of interest in the role as he reveals in the extras. Lisa Bonet in her first film and only nineteen years old is very sexy and actually a good actress. Her sex scene with Rourke is notorious and so good that it not only had to be trimmed to avoid an X rating but got her kicked off the Cosby show as well. De Niro with the exception of the Bonet nude scenes is the most perverse pleasure of the film. With his long nails, neat beard and long hair he is fascinating. It is pretty well known who he represents in the film but I won't give anything away. Two fun facts of trivia instead: Marlon Brando was originally considered for the role and De Niro based his portrayal on director Martin Scorsese.  His scenes with Rourke are among the highlights of the film. It all leads up to a surprise ending worthy of David Lynch. On repeated viewings you can pick up on Parker's recurring motifs such as a fan slowly spinning, dogs barking, and Harry looking at himself in the mirror. The extras are interesting in half of them are EPK interviews shot in 87 and the other half is all new. There is a new introduction, interview, and commentary from Parker. There are five featurettes about an hour long dedicated to voodoo and trying to dispel any myths. The best extras are a \\"no comment\\"ary with Mickey Rourke and a much more in depth interview with him. Rourke admits that his motivation for taking the movie was to keep his house and therefore he can't give any insight into his performance despite the interviewers disbelief and best efforts. The commentary is very interesting as it is aborted after twelve minutes sine Mickey ain't having none of it. His interview is about twenty minutes and he is more forthcoming about his early roles, his boxing career, and how much of a struggle his comeback has been. Angel Heart has been one of my favorite films ever since this DVD came out and for people who take a chance on it I think they will have the same reaction.
B000OCZD5G|5.0|This movie sits next to \\"Blade Runner\\" on the top of my list as the best films of ALL time.  I've been watching the standard cardboard case DVD for 10 years now, and it looked really BAD on my HD LCD.<br /><br />When I fired this baby up and \\"Mad Max 2,\\" the original Austrailian title came up instead of the U.S. \\"Road Warrior,\\" I almost fell out of my chair!  The clarity and crystal clearness of the picture was everthing I've been dreaming for.  I couldn't believe that a film this old could ever look like this.  The sound in my 5.1 theater is even better.  My wife who hates action flicks even sat through with me and was impressed.<br /><br />Sure there isn't much extras on the disk, but who has time for those?  The film is what matters most.<br /><br />The story is about the ultimate anti-hero, a broken man who wanders into a post-apocalytic wasteland battling scavengers for gasoline.  This film has the most amazing stuntwork and car chases.  It has been cloned, copied and is pretty much an important model for all science fiction post apocalytic action films.  I just can't believe director George Miller went on to make \\"The Witches of Eastwick\\" and \\"Babe.\\"  This is a must buy for Blu-Ray sci-fi fans!<br /><br />UPDATE JULY 2014:  I've since purchased the JUNE 2013 release and the picture has a slight video upgrade with an HUGE audio upgrade (lossless).  This disc is still good, but the new one is better here:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00BLSAM3A Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior [Blu-ray]]]
B00005LC1H|5.0|This series can be rather difficult to find as it's from the mid-seventies and British, so when I saw it on Amazon for only $29.99, I didn't waste a single minute ordering it. It's a wonderful series, full of realistic British relationships and true-to-life stereotypes of Spaniards and Germans alike!     Don't take me seriously. They spend the entire series making fun of themselves and other nationalities. And it's hilarious.    And it's John Cleese. Fans of Monty Python will love this.
B0016LTNL4|2.0|I rented this on Unbox as the reviews were good and the trailer looked funny.  Well, for me, I couldn't have been more disappointed.  I like quirky and sacastic and dark humor.  I like british humor.  This was a movie I found flat.  SPOILER!!  The whole gay relationship with a midget and subsequent kidnapping thereof was cheap and crude.  And not in a funny way either.  Rent/buy at your own risk.  I am surprised this movie has as many good reviews as it does.  I guess I'm just getting too old?
B0015AARJI|4.0|Works like it should, force feedback in PS1 and PS2 games as well.  A bit heavier than the SixAxis, but for games that support force feedback this is the new weapon of choice.
B0017XD3OY|2.0|I'm old enough to remember Omega Man.  Was it cheesy?  Yes.  Was this remake worthwhile?  Not to me.  I watched it and was unhappy with how poor this adaptation was.  Too many logic errors.  Either a lot of stuff was edited out, or a committee of the politically correct wrote this.  Not one infected person of color?  In Manhattan?  Not that I care, but this was just the palp that serves for thrillers/remakes.  Many I know really liked the film but they didn't know it was a remake either.
B000B8QG0O|5.0|I ordered this movie so that I could watch it on my Home Theatre system.  Well, let me tell you--not only did the movie sound terrific in surround sound, it was actually an excellent movie.    I'm 45 years old but, once I was able to get over the fact that this was an animated movie, I found the movie quite enjoyable.  I'm convinced that ADULTS of all ages would find TS2 very entertaining!    P.S.  \\"The Incredibles\\" is another excellent animated movie.  It also sounds great in Surround Sound!
B0014JOLI8|5.0|After the first few pages, I knew I was in for something special. I'd never read a book that was alternately narrated in the first person by a demon (!) and in the third person for the main character, who turns out to be a rather unlikable anti-hero. You might think this is the recipe for disaster, but it actually works.  Even with no good (in the sense of morally good) characters in the story, the book is captivating and utterly admirable. Perhaps it is due to the fact that the demon Bartimaeus, although wicked, is actually extremely likable (certainly much more than the main character, a child magician).  Whatever the cause, I loved it to the last page. It is one of those rare first books in a trilogy that has both a completely satisfying finale and a set-up for the remaining two books.  The story takes place in an alternate reality - primarily an alternate England, to be more specific, whose government has turned autocratic. The juvenile magician Nathaniel has to fend for himself in this corrupt system, enlisting the forced help of the demon Bartimaeus.  Due to the political overtones of the story, it lends itself easily for drawing parallels to current political developments - even more so in the other two books of the trilogy.  But you don't have to look for political overtones to appreciate this novel. Any fan of juvenile fantasy will find this a treat.
B000XTLUW0|5.0|I fell in love with muse all over again.. the dvd was amazing and the cd i could listen to over and over
B00132D808|5.0|I love this amazing album.  It's awesomely original, incorporating different musical styles,a variety of instruments, and just whimsical fun.  A great experiment in unbridled true artistry for these  4 gents... grows on me more and more with each listen :)
B00174TKGI|5.0|This is a long movie but well worth it.  Denzel and Russel provide great performances.  Didn't realize it was based on real people.  Highly recommend this movie
B00168HAOO|5.0|OK, I have to admit that I don't care much for today's movies, so I pay no attention to all the hype about upcoming films.  All I knew about Cloverfield was that it was a \\"monster movie\\" of some type, that there had been months of speculation about it prior to release, and that it was filmed like Blair Witch.   Big deal.  None of that interested me.  But I was at a friends house last night and we watched it.  Ho hum, I thought.  I supposed I would have to feign interest in the movie just to be polite.  Well, I didn't have to feign anything!  What a great movie!  But I don't need to convince any fans here.  Let me just conclude with this:  I hope they make a sequel!
B000H5U832|5.0|This movie is pure enjoyment from second one to the closing credits. Talking about the finest animation usually provided by Disney/Pixar partnership is redundant. The plot is convincing (except for the talking cars) as it approaches the modern life in detriment of slow-paced and honest small town America.<br /><br />The movie also approaches the value of having true friends around you and shows that helping others in their most difficult moments gives a sense of self-fulfillment and that no money or glory can ever replace.<br /><br />Entertainment guaranteed or your money back. Truly a family flick.
B00005JLWN|4.0|At first, I thought, a Matrix ripoff. But I was wrong. There are elements of Matrix, of course. BUT..... For the informed viewer, there are also hints of 1984, Fahrenheit 451, Logan's Run, THX 1138, Aeon Flux, I'm sure I could go on. What this means is that any good NEW tale relies on the threads of classics from before. Yes, I was pleasantly surprised when I watched this movie. By all means, watch it, and enjoy. The only problem. . . with all these English speaking actors, why didn't Bale just use his own natural accent?
B000YABYLA|5.0|What makes this film a classic is how the sterotypical settings of life are depicted in an originality devoid of stereotype; this is a path which truly can be seen, touched and felt.<br /><br />While tackling the topic of teen pregnancy, the exploration of the daily race and grind - the track metaphor in the film is fitting - in what actually leads to graduating into adulthood is very real.<br /><br />The trails in life are plenty and Juno is a wonderful portrait in motion.
0792163710|5.0|This is THE definitive (and the first) sort of dark western, the classic morality tale that just about every movie of its type since tries (and usually fails) to live up to. This is the sort of fare that real Americans grew up on: honor, chivalry, courage and loyalty.     George Stevens broke from the usual western fare of the 40's & 50's. The bad guys were the first I ever recall who had real character development. Also has several of the best classic lines: \\"A gun is a tool, Marion. It's as good or as bad as the man behind it.\\" And a great short inspirational speech by Shane (Alan Ladd)which holds the homesteaders together. Terrific performances by Ladd, VanHeflin, Jean Arthur, Jack Palance and Ben Johnson, in fact, by the whole darned cast!     Great story, with outstanding cinematography for its era (won an Academy Award), which holds up well even today. No one who is a fan of the classic American western can count his collection complete without SHANE.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|richard armitage has made period drama in vogue.his john thorton silent speaks more than movie lines.you can feel the emotion he fighting with himself in every sence.i can't believe i miss this move years ago but is very happy i've found this movie.
1400082773|5.0|This book demonstrates in compelling fashion not just the intellectual brillance of the man, but the depth of his character.  He is truly unique.  After reading this book, one cannot help but become a fervant supporter.
0452289963|5.0|The information provided was clear and accurate.  I received my book as expected, and it was in excellent condition.  Overall it was a great experience.
140120306X|2.0|What starts out as a reasonably entertaining chase story devolves at the end into a bizarre semi-surreal mush of overly articulated intellectual BS.  Utterly unsatisfying followup to the excellent earlier books in the series.<br /><br />It begins in the same vein as the earlier  books, showing us an interesting world that is a mash-up of many different literary creations; but it is bogged down with long asides which, while sometimes interesting views on the world, do not advance the story at all.  By the end it becomes a long exercise in exposition, and reads more like a college freshman's drug-inspired philosophy essay than the \\"ripping good yarn\\" I was anticipating.<br /><br />Obviously Moore had something he wanted to do here.  Sadly it wasn't very entertaining.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Can't wait for Season 2 to be available on DVD or Download.<br />The first season is high quality television.
B000MV8AE0|3.0|I enjoyed the story and the actor's portrayal of Beethoven.  Some awesome quotes as well, talking about God's involvement in music.  But...    Once again, I do not understand the need to include the name of Christ in a derogatory manner.  Using His name out of anger...is very very hurtful....why cannot they make a movie that honors the name of Christ instead of cursing...?
B000EGF0NW|2.0|I don't recommend this book to anyone who enjoys prose or literature. Sebold's use of a stripped down, matter-of-fact tone desensitizes her story. Though her rape was a traumatic event, I couldn't feel for her. Perhaps it was her intent not to draw out feeling to avoid pity but personally, I think it was uneffective in conveying her complete story because a memoir needs an emotional plot as well.     I wanted to put down this book before I was even half way though there were still many unfinished subplots like the conviction of her rapist.    I would expect this book in the children's/ preteen section if it weren't for the detailed account of the rape.
B000065BPB|3.0|There's not a whole lot to be said about these that hasn't already been, but I can attest to whomever said they are solid for music that doesn't have a great deal of bass.  Not perfect for rock, not good for hip hop, but for most other types of music, they bring out sound that I didn't know was even there.  People have also said they're small and, as a result, uncomfortable.  I didn't really think they were small, maybe for someone w/a larger than avg head.  They fit me fine and in my opinion, are really comfortable.      They aren't real compact and don't plan on wearing them around town, unless, of course, you like being 'that guy.'  That guy being the dude with ginormous headphones, shutting out the rest of the world.  On that note, they do block noise fantastically well.  You could almost use them to land a plane, if for some reason you found yourself needing to land a plane.  In any case, these headphones are probably best thought of as 'location headphones' rather than ones you would cruise around w/.  Happy listening.
B0013BNY2Q|5.0|Give it a chance there are at least 5 great songs.....I know R.E.N.'s last few CD's haven't gotten as much press, but this is great....
