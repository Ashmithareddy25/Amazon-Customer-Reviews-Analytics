B0041X90ZI|5.0|Transatlantic is definitely a band for lovers of progressive rock only, as many of their songs are epic length and not designed for those with short attention spans. That is a shame because the talent shown in this collection is amazing. The live airing of &#34;The Whirlwind&#34; is just as good, if not better then the studio version. I'm not sure if it's the longest prog song ever, but it's damn close at 77 minutes! The other tracks are played with a renewed energy that shows the band is glad to be performing again after a nine year break, and now playing better than ever.<br /><br />They're currently working on new material, so it will be interesting to see what they do next. I doubt they could top this, but being the veterans they are, they don't have to.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I like being able to choose the amount of pieces to put. together. I also love being able to get more puzzles whenyou want them
B000I186FW|5.0|This movie presents fine acting, cinematography, and a good adaptation of the graphic novel. Good action and good dialogue keeps the viewer engaged.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This app is a literally a must have for someone trying to make any kind of modification to there device, but just as good if your not. It is by far the easiest way to access file and has great media players. This should be the first app you get on your device.
B001DUDKEY|1.0|This movie was slow moving and boring.  We stopped watching it after about 10 to 15 minutes.  I do not recommend it.
B005TKD6NY|3.0|The first part of this book was original, and poetic.  I was quickly captured by Murakami's prose (and Birnbaum's translation).  But, by and by, the main character started sounding like Holden Caulfield and the originality faded.  There were some interesting characters and some good moments, but the book trailed off into repetitive dialogue and superficial observations.  The beginning was better than the end.
B008AX1HD8|2.0|very slow didnt think its story related to the other harry hole thrillers. where not really told why he was their.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Even if you are not part of the family it is hard not to get caught up in their lives.
B003ASLJK4|5.0|This movie is a beautiful love story, that was tastefully done. I had it originially on VHS and I wanted to show it to a friend of mind. So when I found it on Amazon.com I decided to order it. It was just as good as I remembered.
B004I9CXHW|5.0|Like most of you visiting this page I bought a VW vehicle and immediately was confronted by the fact that it only came with the iPhone adapter.<br /><br />I felt like this was a bit shortsighted on the part of the VW engineers, and was trying to avoid the $45 the dealer wanted to charge me for this cable.<br /><br />So I took a chance and so far this cable has worked like a charm.<br /><br /> I hope that VW or this company makes a MDI to Micro-USB cable soon, so I don't have to use a second cable to go from USB to my phone, but overall I'm happy with the product and certainly glad it works.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|This game is so  awesome. Om nom and his ancestors are so adorable. My favorite of om noms ancestors is the pirate. I also have ALL of the stars in ALL of the levels. Hope you will enjoy the game as much as I did. Oh, I cannot wait for more levels. Thanks for reading bye. -bdogsup poop
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Like so many other dedicated to The Song of Ice and Fire, the Game of Thrones seasons 1 and 2 have me captivated from start to finish!
B0069JBKHI|2.0|We purchased the Withings Smart Baby Monitor with very high hopes. I had been looking for a smart-phone app based baby monitor with our daughter on the way this summer. After researching a few other similar monitors, this seemed to have the most features and relatively good reviews so we ordered it. Before diving into the review, I should note that I work with computers for a living. So I'm probably a bit more tech savvy than the average user.<br /><br />The Good:<br /><br />Upon opening the package, I was very pleased with the look and construction of the unit. Very clean looking unit without many buttons or lights. Seems like it would fit into any nursery without standing out too much. Unit isn't too big, and folds up like a clam shell for easy storage.<br /><br />Setup wasn't too difficult. Found the app on the Android market very easily. Instructions were easy to follow, and I was ready to go after connecting to my phone via Bluetooth and connecting my Wifi network. Everything looked pretty good at this point.<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />Unfortunately the good feeling didn't stick around long. After I was up and running, I immediately noticed how poor the video frame rate and video quality were. I realized that this would be a huge issue once we were using it with our daughter because the lag almost made the monitor unusable. Without exaggerating, there was at least a 1-2 second lag between live movement and seeing movement on my phone. Just for reference, the camera, my phone, and my wifi router were all within 10 feet of each other during this trial. There was no difference in lag or quality with using Bluetooth or Wifi. I even tried resetting and re-connecting everything from the beginning, but ended up with the same result.<br /><br />I wanted to review the night-vision and other features, but the lag and quality were so bad that I honestly couldn't give a fair review.<br /><br />Overall, I was very disappointing with the Withings Smart Baby Monitor. Forthe money, I didn't expect a performance this poor. We ended up with a similar product by Motorola, and it has worked great on every test so far.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I must have read the book hundreds of times in my youth. This is my second favorite Jane Eyre movie. The movie was extremely good.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|I loved this app when I first got it<br /> It was fun and exciting. I had just gotten my iPod touch and the first app I downloaded was subway surfers. I got really mad one day because I was playing on my iPod touch on subway surfers and I think that the game crashed my iPod. Or the game gave my iPod a virus. This is an ok game but I am really upset about my iPod.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|I loved this movie. I watched it at least 3 time in a row. I think the book version of this story was well read by my generation and the generation before me.
B00280LYHS|5.0|Wow I never read anything like this Rick put in great description there was a lot of action and suspence
B00000IQV7|5.0|I had to replace my video, so ordered the DVD.  A moving story and a good example of what truly makes us happy (one should also see the documentary, Happy).
B001HN69AY|1.0|My wife is a Ledger and Johnny Depp fan, and bought this because of that. However, neither one of these two are in the film for more than about 30 seconds. Plus, this is a mediocre movie at best, with very sketchy plot. Don't bother.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|If you seen all of the Lord of the Rings movies, you will really enjoy this one.  Brings alot of things together.  Full of excitement and adventure.  Worth buying....
B002XZOZQA|2.0|This is a horrible adaptation of one of the best American musicals of all time.  It's as if they cast the whole movie for dancing with no regard for acting.  There are some great dance sequences.  A lot of awful acting.  And a heartbreak story forced in where there was none in the stage version just to give Michael Douglas something to do.  Some of the great songs from the stage version are here, some are missing and replaced with bad songs written just for the movie.
B007D2XSW0|4.0|Seems to work well, haven't gone through all the filters but had a nice gui. Easy to use, fluid controls and menu layout.
B008JFUORW|2.0|HANGOVER PART III is an aggressive and mean-spirited movie.  This is not to say that it isn't funny...some of it is very funny.  But director Todd Phillips has made the mistake of thinking that we enjoy the Hangover films because we want to see our three stars behave like some kind of modern-day, R-rated Three Stooges.  Taking painful blows.  Insulting each other.  Being generally misanthropic and unlikeable.  In fact, what we loved about the first film had just as much to do with the camaraderie between the 3 main characters, as well as a healthy dose of the element of surprise.  It was a comedy with a mystery (what DID happen that night, and where the heck is Doug?).  The comedy came first; the mystery was the vehicle through which surprising things could happen.  (Best of all...Mr. Chow jumping nude from the trunk!).  But we laughed and we enjoyed our time with these hapless and unusual characters.  HANGOVER PART II rehashed the plot, but raised the stakes and raised the violence level.  It now was meant to be amusing when a character is raped or another is mutilated and his surgical career ruined.<br /><br />III is a full-fledged action flick, with bits of comedy thrown in.  Animals and people die...violently.  Frequently.  The tone is thus very aggressive.  And it's mean-spirited because the characters really spend much of the film hating each other.  They seem to bristle being in the same scenes together...and I don't just mean the characters.  Bradley Cooper is dialing it in, and seems to be hoping he'll slip under the radar.  Ed Helms mostly yells about how fed up he is with everything, and the actor seems to mean it as much as his character.  Zach Galifianakis fares best, but he's also just relying on being as weird and inappropriate as possible, rather than being a real person.  That being said, almost every funny line in the movie is his.  I suspect I could count on my ten fingers the number of genuine laughs in the film.<br /><br />And HANGOVER III makesthe mistake of essentially making Mr. Chow the 4th star.  He's in the film almost as much as the other guys and he officially wears out his welcome within 10 minutes.  His character should only be doled out in small doses, and while he was quite funny in #1 and annoying in #2, he is flat out UNWELCOME in #3.  I think Ken Jeong can be a very funny performer, and he's capable of some real acting...but by the end of this film, I truly hoped he might be killed off.<br /><br />John Goodman is on hand in the role of a bad guy, and he's given nothing funny or remarkable to do.  How do you as a screenwriter or director waste John Goodman, one of the most naturally affable and engaging actors in film?  Melissa McCarthy makes what is initially a welcome appearance as a pawn shop owner who takes a liking to Galifianakis' Alan.  But her character grows tiresome.  Another victim of director Phillips' inclination to leave the camera on just a couple of beats too long.  Sometimes uncomfortable silences are funny; sometimes they are just uncomfortable.  Guess which way HANGOVER PART III leans?  Heather Graham makes a return appearance and even Jeffrey Tambor is briefly on hand.  Pretty much everyone looks vaguely unhappy to be in this film.  The whole enterprise reeks of \\"Contractual Obligation.\\"  I wish they'd felt obligated to provide more laughs.<br /><br />It's sad to see the series end this way, with ever diminishing returns.  If you're a big fan of the first two, I'd say you should go ahead and drag yourself to this.  Maybe.  It's sort of a depressing mess.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|We all know Tarantino is a genius. Knowing this will prepare us to expect the best and this movie is it. I think Fox, Decaprio, and Samuel L. Jackson were superb in this movie and the story was very original. I really liked it.
B007P6VM04|4.0|I thought this was going to have the songs from the first season.  I was disappointed when it didn't have some of my favorites.  It does have some that aren't on the season two CD though.
B00B2DGYQS|5.0|I can only add another bravo to the positive reviews already posted for \\"Yossi.\\"  The unhurried and completely human telling of Yossi Gettelman's healing after the loss of his great love and all the regrets that went with the tragedy makes the story wonderfully credible.  Yossi's meeting after 10 years with the parents of his dead partner is heartbreaking, but is the beginning of the recovery of this wonderful and deeply grieving man.  The second part of the film--the meeting with a free-spirited young soldier who recognizes Yossi for the good man that he is a great statement of optimism and salvation and will bring a tear to the most cynical of readers.<br /><br />\\"Yossi\\" is a very fine film about a gay man and is, at the same time, a film for anyone who likes a fine film about the human heart.  Highly recommended.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Challenging but not too much to be overly frustrating. Just wish there was more than 4 chapters. Looking forward to more games from these people. In fact, I can hardly wait.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Good strong characters had to keep my daughter busy so I could finish it! You'll love the banter and her friends as  they  help a gal out over her decision making. Very smartly written and entertaining.
B000TEMQIQ|5.0|When a friend suggested I listen to B.R.M.C. I expected a typical '90s grunge sound. Certainly there are elements of it in this album, but its roots are more deeply grounded the more melodic sound of the late-'80s British invasion. There are even hints of George Harrison and late-era Beatles at work. In all, a wholly challenging and satisfying CD. Highly recommended.
B00003CX8V|5.0|A great movie,with a superb cast....And.as someone once said, ''they don't make them like that anymore&#34;&#34;( sadly ,it's true). i used to love going to the movies ..........now it'as a big waste of time.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This game is outstanding and never gets old. You can keep playing for hours. Even though the app offers in app purchases I haven't purchased anything yet and I've been playing for months now.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Good story, very realistic view of a child growing up in foster care. Shows good insight into one of society's saddest situations.
B000LGZHDS|5.0|Just like the spoungebob best day ever I was satisfied with this product , just like the child I purchased it for.
B009AMANBA|5.0|This is a movie to be watched more than once.  The performances were terrifice especially Daniel Day Lewis and Sally Field. The settings and photographpy were excellent.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|The film content was disturbing at times, but also very thought-provoking and extremely well-acted and directed.  Quentin Tarantino is a brilliant director and quite unique as he infuses authenticity, grit, and tongue and cheek humor in a few places (similar to Pulp Fiction where that movie, too, had disturbing content but tongue and cheek humor).  The overall tenor of the film, however, is quite serious.<br /><br />Tough to watch in places but extremely well-done and I would highly recommend the movie -- for adults only, though.  And, this movie is violent as well, so it's not for the &#34;faint of heart&#34;!
B005ES1EH6|5.0|These Crocs are an improvement over the original Crocs.  With the old Crocs, the bottom of the shoe would start to wear.  If you walked on a surface with water you could possibly slip and fall.  The new Crocs have a much deeper tread that prevents this problem.  They seem to wear better and are very comfortable.  These are our favorite shoe, and will buy again in the future.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is so worth getting it.  You don't know what to do, then you get the hang of it.  It's such a time waster.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|This is one of the best of it's genre !!!!  Amazing character development, great settings, compelling story plots !!!  This is my 2nd marathon viewing and I'm watching the re-runs on PBS.  You lose yourself in Larkrise and Candleford.  The people become your friends and neighbors and you don't want them to go.  It was so heartbreaking that this splendid series was cut short at 3 seasons.  I could watch it for years.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|I have watched this movie about 4 time and still fine it entertaining. Great cast of actors and oscar worthy.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|After reading book 1 I had to know what happened next so I bought book 2. This 2nd book was exciting.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Interesting parody of names, but so completely stupid that my first action after zipping through is was to delete it from my Kindle.  Had to go with one star as there were no lower options.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved this book as well as book 1 & 2. I plan to read all 3 again. It really is a love story. I read book 1 and had to know what would happen in book 2 so I purchased 2 & 3. I am glad I did. At the end of 1 & 2 I had to continue reading.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|Interesting parody of names, but so completely stupid that my first action after zipping through is was to delete it from my Kindle.  Had to go with one star as there were no lower options.
B0034DGPEU|3.0|I wasn't impressed with this book. A friend recommended this book. I won't read it a 2nd time which I do with really good books.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Interesting parody of names, but so completely stupid that my first action after zipping through is was to delete it from my Kindle.  Had to go with one star as there were no lower options.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|It feels, tastes, smells, looks, and sounds like Myst and all of its subsequent follow-ups, but is still completely original and a work of brilliance all unto itself. It's deliciously vague in its story and ends with a satisfying cliffhanger. The best part is that if you don't know Myst from Mario, you'll still be able to pick this game up and thoroughly enjoy and challenge yourself.<br />Bravisimo, Fireproof Games!
B0037HOWKW|5.0|My son had fun building this.  It is so cute and realistic.  He gave it to his piano teacher with a thank you card.  She loved it.
0425221806|5.0|I just discovered this book and I wasn't instantly drawn to it, but figured I'd give it a chance.  Glad I did!
B004LWZWGK|4.0|Nothing will top Heaths portrayal of the Joker, but this is very well done. It also had a nice ending.
B0010SKUYM|3.0|The action is fun and gripping at times, though infrequent. The world is interesting but rather harmless and much too civilized, the characters and dialogue somewhat shallow, the narration at times painfully cheesy and written for children. Still worth a read.
0061128562|5.0|Bought the books to donate to charity. They should really enjoy them. My grandkids like this one and some of the others by the same author.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Purchased for my 2 1/2 year old daughter and she loves it.  Watches it over and over again.  It is very funny and can't wait for the next movie that is coming this summer.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Wow! What a great book! I hope to one day teach it in my High School English classes. Can't wait for the movie
B007N8RULO|5.0|Very enjoyable to pass the time and figure out different ways to cut down on moves to improve score and cut down on time.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is excellent.  If you are looking for a great puzzle game go no further.  There will be more rooms to explore later.
B00C4QPYJU|3.0|Older, but classic Stallone in a tough guy role tempered by a family theme. Complete with overmuscled goons, evil father-in-law, bratty kid who corrects his attitude and all the elements of a good family action flic.
B004EI3ON4|5.0|Daft Punk has redefined what a soundtrack is defined to be. The first track is orchestral, like you would hear in many soundtracks, but it transitions into orchestral with beats and techno layers as you move through, till you finally reach tracks that are pure Tech and AMAZING! More what you would expect to find on a songs from or inspired by. I must admit, every track I listen to on my commute. I don't skip past a single one. It seems rare for me to do that now, but this is an album that delivers on every track.<br /><br />I am truly in awe of the talent displayed by this group to do an album with this range.
0385737955|5.0|This was another gift for our grandson and we have not heard if he likes it or not.  This went along with the gaming chair which he loved.
B00BJDARA0|3.0|After their amazing DVD, &#34;In the still of the night&#34; that they released in around 2005 - 2006, this comes up a little short.  The production quality is still good but not amazing like &#34;In the still of the night&#34;.  The band has so many great new songs that they don't play.  Whitesnake like so many band's DVD's keeps re-hashing the same old hits; it gets quite boring.  There's only 12 live songs or solo's and only 4 songs from the last 2 albums.  They could of added more, I would of paid more.  The musicians are fantastic as usual but their instruments are so tuned down the songs lose a little bit of pop.  Not terrible, I'd still buy it because I'm a fan.
1423140591|5.0|Great gift for a grandson.  why do I need to put in words that I don't need and don't have for this product
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Oh yes good ending for a great story. No cliffhanger you know what is going to happen and you know that they love each other
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Funny, slapstick humor with good beats and songs that will have you singing along. It's one of those movies you can watch multiple times and still find something new the next time you watch it.
B00BHU9BV6|1.0|I was so annoyed by the bogus Hollywood presentation that I couldn't recognize the important themes and lessons in Tolstoy's story.
B0046ECFRM|5.0|WARNING: SPOILERS<br /><br />I was going through a lot of these reviews and I noticed a common theme of lower raters not liking St. Clair. A main reason people seem to not like him is because he cheats and apparently this novel makes that out to be okay. I think we're reading different novels. To my understanding, the last, oh, 100 pages is all about how cheating is horrible in every form of the word \\"cheating.\\" The reason why everything turned into the whole horrible mess towards the end is because he  cheated on Ellie and didn't just break up with her at the beginning. Among many other things, I think the bigger issue the novel is trying to address is that just because he didn't actually physically cheat on Ellie doesn't mean that he didn't emotionally cheat on her and that is just as terrible and wrong. So no, I don't hate St. Clair because he is human and is scared and makes mistakes just like the rest of us. But I do agree that St. Clair and Anna may not end up happily ever after, but mysteries like that are better left unresolved by the author.
B000S88JTS|5.0|The first time I saw this movie was in a theatre and I started laughing during the opening scene and continued to laugh when everyone was quiet. So enjoyed this movie that I later purchased a street motorcycle and put 50K miles on it in five years. Felt like I was buddies with Mert Lawwill, Malcolm Smith and Steve McQueen when the movie was over. Bruce Brown exceeded The Endless Summer with this film. Movie covers the broad spectrum of motorcycle sport from the pros to the weekend warriors to the everyday commuter.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is heart wrenchingly beautiful. If you know anything about John Green as an author or as a person (via vlogbrothers and such) you can pretty much assume that this book is going to make you laugh and cry all at the same time. It does not disappoint. John has a way of making his characters feel like your best friend in a way that everybody who reads his book can relate to. I highly recommend this book to people of all ages from all backgrounds. However, I don't recommend reading it in a public place as it will literally have you laughing out loud and crying within pages. DFTBA.
B00CRWJ7VC|4.0|It's one of those type of movies you have to watch closely, or even watch more than once.  It gets better each time.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I'm a fan of this triolgy. Was glad I purchased this movie- had seen it in the theater-and  new I had to own the movie.Thanks.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|I gave this book 4 stars - it's a good story, integrating some mystic themes and technology. It's well-written and compelling. All of my book club readers enjoyed it, too - and we rarely agree on anything. Recommend it, nice easy, weekend read.
0061124958|5.0|Simply the best.  Charlotte and her friends weave a marvelous tale for adults and children to enjoy.  I could read it every year and find something new each time.  Wilbur is most appealing, too.
B00CRW2066|3.0|This album reminds me of making egg salad.  It stinks up the house but you know it will only taste better tomorrow.
B00AYR2FOI|4.0|Great music but very mellow and slow. Still, Boz Scaggs does everything so well can't fault him. Great listening music.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|This was a very engrossing game. I really enjoyed it. It was challenging but not in a way that I couldn't figure it out. I will say it was a bit short for the price but definitely the best puzzle game I've played in a while. I plan to pay more by this creator.
B005DOKM9M|5.0|nice looking and feels well made. Would definitely recommend this product to others and buy again!<br />you can't go wrong
B004G7UTXG|4.0|Very good story line and Irons and DeNiro show their worth. Considered to be one of the better religious movies and the score is excellent.
B005OYKI1I|5.0|This movie advances the plot of the F&F series far better than others in the franchise did.  The character development, and willingness of the writers to do some pretty drastic things made this movie quite enjoyable.
B008EZVNO0|5.0|I gave this Van Morrison album to my husband as a Christmas gift, and he must love it 'cause he plays it all the time.  You can't go wrong with Van the Man.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|What more can I say about this great series without spoiling the plot? If you are thinking about ordering or already have, then you're already a Dexter fan.
B000Q6GUW0|3.0|I bought this dvd and 5 other seasons on the recommendation of my back doctor. So, far the first episode has been very dry and dull. The second episode picked up nicely. I am up to the fifth episode and still unsure about this show. At times, it's a series about a psychotic serial killer with morals. Other times, it's about a man who has no feelings but shows emotions like anger, frustration and fear. Oh, and there's the relationship between the main character and his damaged girlfriend. Who he feels is as damaged as he is. Now, I do hope these are not considered spoilers, as they are the central focus of the series it seems. There are more things going on in the series, such as his past relationship with his foster father, he relationship with his foster sister, his relationship with his coworkers etc. At this time, I can see the character developing into a very interesting but bizarre person. And of course the series will follow suit. We hope. After all, I have 6 seasons to watch. Can I recommend this series, sort of. I am not quite certain it is for everyone. It's growing on me though. So, I gave it three stars. Perhaps I should give it four, but time will tell.<br /><br />Ralph J. Fitcher.
B009NX409M|5.0|I have watched this movie so many times.  Two of my favorite actors.  De Niro and Streep are great in this movie.
B00COGY2P2|4.0|Love Tom Cruise, even in his &#34;typical&#34; role. He does all the stunts and didn't even kiss the girl (lol)
0525953728|5.0|This book I'd recommend to anyone.  I usually don't read books very quickly and jump from book to book at times.  This book kept me rivited and I finished this in a few days.  The training and what they go thru is amazing.  The strenght of conviction and ability to face the fear and move thru it to do their job to save us.  Amazing.<br /><br />I'd recommend this to anyone interested in learning what goes into this type of operation.<br /><br />Good read for sure!!!
B003QTUQGU|5.0|Fantastic!  I showed this to my 7th grade English class after we read the poem, &#34;Jabberwocky&#34; and they LOVED IT!
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|A series will have you on the edge of your seat, craving more. The most interesting character is Joe Carroll the charming but psychotic serial killer. Kevin Bacon plays Ryan Hardy, a former FBI agent who has a complex personality that unfolds with each episode.  The character of \\"Joe Carroll* will win even you over, so it is not hard to understand \\"The Following\\" of Joe Carroll.<br />In episode 6, \\"The Fall\\", Kevin Bacon's acting deserves an Emmy! If you watch only one, make it that episode!<br /><br />CANNOT WAIT FOR SEASON 2!!!
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Nicely paced, engaging tale of the supernatural written by an acclaimed professor of history who really knows her historical subjects
B003097B64|5.0|great collection of most of little feats albums. worth the money for any little feat fan, compact cds in sleeves make easy storage.
B0087ITBPC|5.0|This movie is really funny, and I am so glad that I purchased it.  I would highly recommend this movie!!
B00AYXNKIC|4.0|Best game of the trilogy. They keep getting better each new release. Cant wait to see what they dream up next.
B005FISC52|5.0|I have watched One Tree Hill since the very beginning, and the last season was definitely a great way to end.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|great app! use it all the time, love the audio!  makes writing research papers a breeze and my vocabulary has improved!
B00B8WXG9G|5.0|I really enjoyed listening to this CD.  I really enjoyed the duets, especially Tom Jones!!  A great CD for a romantic evening!!
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I carry around my tablet so I can read more, but also needed to get some work done on the go and since the tablet is easier to carry around I always wanted the things office pro provided to do so. You will love it, you may need an attached keyboard to make typing more relaxing as if you were typing on a laptop or so.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|I really enjoyed listening to Rod Stewart's new CD.  He really has a lot of talent.  I would recommend it.
B00CKOYVG8|3.0|You literally have to buy little packages of angry bird power ups to achieve anything in this game. For those who have money to waste this is surely for you. If you plan to spend money almost every time you play this is for you. The game itself is fun. But I think it's ridiculous to be spending money to be able to do well. If you're a parent do not let your children have access to your credit card with this game, because when your bills come all fun and games will be over.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Great sound reproduction from a great pair of headphones! I have a pair of Ultrasone HF-581s that are a little more expensive than these and overall, these sound better! Although the HF-581s are a little louder with the surround sound effect, the MDR7506 have a cleaner bass sound and are more comfortable one my ears are long listening sessions. If you want quality sound from a good pair of headphones under $100, these are the best!
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I would only recommend this to you if you are willing to spend a good amount of money to do well in this game. Otherwise the game is very boring if you don't have money to spend on the power ups. Parents do not leave this game reckless with your kids. Set up a password so that they have to get your permission each time they are going pay for the power ups. The game is very fun, you you can play it without spending your money but it's not as near as fun as it would be with the power ups. As I said before it's going to get very boring if you don't have money to spend. I think the power ups should've been free but the game would be way too addicting and children would spend way less time on homework or school work.
B004EF8AJA|5.0|This is a great mini-series.  The story is well translated from the book and the actors are excellent.  I've watched it a few times already and, to me, its a classic.
B008K6HN8I|4.0|If you're having problems getting flash player on your tablet use this to install it after you download. This application allows you to open many files that are not supported by the regular software on the tablet. This application definitely improves the capabilities of your tablet. It also allows you to manage files stored in your cloud. It is definitely for those who want to download programmes, large number of files, etc., and still be able to manage them.
193700788X|5.0|I can't really write much on this without giving away plot points/spoilers.  I will say that Mrs. Harris wrapped up Sookie story in a way that was very satisfactory and with a hint of sadness (too me).  I've enjoyed all the novels but this one is a fine ending to the series.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game I think there's nothing wrong with this game I think this game subway surfers  is amazseing and fun.
B000IZ4R1U|4.0|I enjoy this film...great action and the treasure hunter story line keeps you interested.  Good transition from the game to film.
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|This game wasn't what I expected. I got it for my 3 yr old but he is not able to play it by himself, because there is some reading involved.
B001NZ4ZRA|5.0|Awakened Feelings I never knew I had, I never wanted to leave, and still I know I have to let them go.
B000000XBC|5.0|A lot of great tunes that don't get beat up on radio - awesome party album ! You can't wear it out.
B004XZR63M|1.0|This book really wakes you up about how money works and improves your financial intelligence.  If you really want to live life happy, wealthy and joyful and not work for money as Robert and his Rich Dad mentioned, read this book and other recommended books on its list and do what is been told.
0062059963|4.0|America is truly torn between her first love Aspen and the charming Prince Maxon. Her chemistry is with Maxon is fantastic and she certainly goes through emotional highs and lows whenever he's around. On the other hand, Aspen is her steady rock. She cares for him, but it feels like he's her backup if things go wrong with Maxon. And it's hard for the reader to root for him as we have no backstory on him other than he dumps America before leaving to join the military. His main purposed seems to be to create tension when Aspen and America sneak off to be alone together and talk in secret.<br /><br />Through the course of this emotional installment, America is confronted with secrets, tragedy, intrigue, and lies. The emotional roller coaster with America and Maxon hits a boiling point and their relationship changes drastically. This powerful sequel was captivating and exciting from beginning to end. I love this story and the characters, and look forward to the final installment in this incredible trilogy.<br /><br />Review previously posted at SciFiChick.
0060191325|4.0|&#34;Overall good condition. Pages were slightly yellowed, as some books get when being shelved/stored for long period of time... also had that musty old book smell to it.&#34;
159463176X|4.0|I enjoyed this book, but I wish the author had provided, as some do, a diagram or list of family members so I could keep them straight. I also wish the plot had taken a direct line from past to present instead of jumping back and forth between families, locations and time periods. It was all too easy to lose the thread of the story, though it all came together in a touching conclusion. I did not like this book quite as much as Hosseini's first two -- especially Kite Runner -- because it seemed to be more a collection of vignettes or related short stories than a novel. But it exhibits the skillful writing for which Hosseini has become known and often was quite moving. Readers might want to make their own list or diagram of family members as they go along to help them keep track of who's who. Bottom line: It's a good story that's told in a sometimes confusing fashion, but it's well worth reading.
B00466HM28|4.0|The is an awesome portable Keyboard. I was skeptical at first and when I received it my skepticism was true. It is very toy like. But it works Better than my old midi keyboard with half the space and bulkiness. I just wish it had a mod and pitch wheel. Also the editor software it comes with is very vague. But for the price it's an awesome product and it plays great. Great starter or money saver item.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|great John Grisham novel.  Kept me going to the end because it is full of twists and turns.  highly recommend this to the JG fans who love this style of fiction.
0380730405|4.0|It's been a lot of years since I had read this book, so I choose it for our book club. It was worth it. I never realized that the girl that reveals what Rebecca is like is never named in the book. No wonder I always identified with her. Clever writing well defined characters.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I always love how Ken Follett weaves the lives of so many together with such detail. Another wonderful Ken Follett book.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|While I don't like some of the very disturbing (to me at least) images of how victims are killed, the psychological aspects of the relationships are fascinating.  Especially those between Hannibal and whomever he interacts with.  Mads M. is awesome in this role.
193700788X|2.0|I don't believe this has been done before, but wouldn't it be wonderful if Charlaine wrote a \\"do-over\\" of \\"Dead Ever After?\\"<br />She could keep the same love interest outcome but redo the following:<br /> ⁃ Write the entire novel in first person<br /> ⁃ Throw out the convoluted plot and write a more \\"believable\\" one with different characters<br /> ⁃ Don't introduce a Devil or any new creature in the last book (Eric has another child?  Really??)<br /> ⁃ Change Sam back to the brave character he's always been and let him loose!  (he didn't even get to \\"change\\" in this book!)<br /> ⁃ Bring back the Eric we all know and love<br /> ⁃ Enough with the fairies already<br /> ⁃ Don't overkill the 'Sookie's ready for a quieter life' part.  She's part supernatural, living among supernaturals - her fans want to know that will continue!<br /> ⁃ Nitpicking here - I don't remember Sookie saying things like, \\"Dang\\" or \\"Damn\\" - sounded out of character.<br /> ⁃<br />Then Charlaine could keep what did work:<br /> ⁃ Diantha and Mr. Catalaides<br /> ⁃ The human characters and their side stories<br /> ⁃ page turning adventures<br /> ⁃<br />It's never been done but I bet a re-write of \\"Dead Ever After\\" would sell very well and Charlaine would have an ending to make her proud.<br />  I'm so sorry to criticize; I've really loved the Sookie series, but I was very disappointed with the last book. :-(
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I can play this all day if I had the time.  It is a fun game that I would recommend.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Addicted to this show! Now on to the 2nd season! We watch every night before bed, keeps you on your toes!
0525423656|5.0|again staying true to the story line keeps you wanting more, very hard to find a place to stop and put it down

0142410705|3.0|Uniquely funny 3.5 stars<br /><br />John Green speaks to my inner nerd and possibly my outer nerd too. The way his hero Colin sees the world is fantastic but extremely nerdy (I mean that in the best way). If you have a hard time connecting with off beat characters this might be a struggle for you. Everything is interesting to Colin he sees so many minute details and can interconnect them in so many strange ways that I find him absolutely fascinating.<br /><br />\\"Colin did not laugh. Instead he thought, Tampons have strings? Why? Of all the major human mysteries - God, the nature of the universe, etc. - he knew the least about tampons. To Colin, tampons were a little bit like grizzly bears: he was aware of their existence, but he'd never seen one in the wild, and didn't really care to.\\"<br /><br />Colin is a socially awkward prodigy addicted to anagramming. He knows 11 languages and so many useless random facts that he won a kids t.v. game show (side note never play scrabble with him he will destroy you). But after being dumped by the last in a long line of Katherines he wallows in self pity until his best friend Hassan convinces him that a road trip is what he really needs to clear him mind and get back to 'normal' so off they go.<br /><br />While Colin is struggling with the fact that as a child prodigy he really hasn't become anything yet and he has been dumped now by nineteen Katherines he meets Lindsey Lee Wells in the little town of Gutshot. Hassan and Colin put the road trip on hold to work with Lindsey to record some of the history of the people in the town and by doing so Colin finds a way in interconnect with the world. Also there is an equation to predict the length of relationships and math and graphs which I loved but is not for everyone.<br /><br />John Green seems effortlessly funny and I always enjoy the unique interactions between his characters.<br /><br />\\"Shame about how we're gonna die here,<br />though. I mean, seriously. An Arab and a half-Jew<br />enter a store in Tennessee. It's the beginning of a<br />joke, and the punch line is \\"sodomy''.\\"<br /><br />\\"Dude, you're such a geek. And that's coming from an<br />overweight Star Trek fan who scored a 5 on the AP Calculus<br />test. So you know your condition is grave\\"<br /><br />It is how I imagine guys talking to one another when they are best friends. This is a coming of age tale where by learning about others we really learn about ourselves. If you don't let the math scare you and you are able to tap into your inner nerd who is so excited about random things this can be a great read.br />enter a store in Tennessee.

B00914JWSW|4.0|A new set from Barbra always begs  this  question?  Is the material worthy of the singer?  Release Me  answers yes and no. No one sings a Broadway showstopper  better than her.  So the highlights of the set include Home and Being Good. I wish she would do an entire jazz album.  She proves her talent on Willow Weep For Me.  One of the great songs from the jazz era.  I always felt every arrangment I heard of this great song was not quite right.  Ray Ellis arrangement is the best , and so is Barbra singing it.  I would love to hear her version of Lush Life.  Another great jazz tune no one has ever got right.  The rest of the album  is Jimmy Webb and Randy Newman and new songs.  It is a mixed bag.  Willow weep For Me makes it worth the price.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I had a lot of fun with this game. Interesting levels, really gets you going with great level design it really gets you into it!
B0054JZC6E|1.0|Download one app just to download 101 more? It's a waste of time and I wish I knew better about it.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I used to play this on my computer but then getting it for my phone was the best decision ever. It's a little slow in transition to my toshiba tablet, but the gameplay is still there and super fun. Great level design, sound quality
B0064T6LV8|1.0|Waste of time playing this game. I uninstalled after downloading and playing like 2 rounds. It's not worth the precious memory space.
B00821OX98|3.0|A bit too much religion. The aliens are just ugly but hardly sinister. Just barely pulls me into the next installment
B003Y74AZ2|1.0|The item was below my standards.  I would not recommend this item.  The sizing is not very specific.  It was of no use to me.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Loved this book. I laughed out loud through the whole booked! One of the best books I have read in a long time. I wasn't used to reading from the male POV but I highly recommend it.
B009CF3MEK|5.0|I saw the recent movie The Great Gatsby. I decided I wanted to watch the 1974 movie of the same name.  I really enjoyed it.  I would recommend the 1974 version for anybody to watch.
0345529057|5.0|Fantastic purchase- only twenty bucks and I have the first four books? Yes please! Everyone I know wants to borrow them.
B00COGY2P2|1.0|Plot was ridiculous, acting was terrible and wooden.  Worst movie I have seen in a long time.  Would never recommend it to anyone.
B00BHMF578|5.0|This movie was well done.  Ben Affleck did a tremendous job.  Even though I knew the ending it was still edge of your seat entertainment.
B004W1GCNC|4.0|I was really missing my Downton Abbey (between seasons) when a friend recommended that I try the new(?) Upstairs Downstairs.  I had been a fan of the original many, many, many years ago and decided to try it.  I have gotten totally involved in the characters and their lives.  Unfortunately, season one is only 3 episodes, but I'm looking forward to season 2!
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|What an amazing adventure.  I didn't want it to end.  What courage, what strength, what determination!  I want some of what she has in my life.
B0099114WO|5.0|My wife and I had planned for weeks to see this in a theater but we never got there. After watching it, we're not sorry we bought the DVD. We enjoyed it so much we're glad we have it on hand to watch again.
B004LSJCJM|5.0|Joe Bomassa is a great and upcoming star. His voice blends well with the songs he sings. His potential is endless.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|This man is a great artist which he displays in his artistry. The collection of songs  makes for desirable listening..
B00CWM3F4C|5.0|As a lifelong AIC fan, I eagerly awaited the release of the second \\"new\\" album - NOT DISAPPOINTED!!! William DuVall is simply an amazing musician/vocalist, and Jerry and the rest really bring it. Very heavy & musical, and true to form. Only a couple more mellow songs (like Heaven Beside You, etc). The rest are fairly dirty, grungy songs, and IMHO, what the rock industry has been missing for too long. Lots of minor key, and the trademark AIC harmonization. Jerry lets William take the reins a little more than Black-Blue, and William proves his worth.<br /><br />I have seen them once already this year in concert, (Carolina Rebellion) and will see them at least once, possibly twice more. I can only hope they play more of their new album, now that it is released. If you've never seen them live, they are phenomenal.<br /><br />And Jerry, if you read this, your new (and pretty sexy!) haircut makes you look a little bit like Bootstrap Bill, the pirate!
B000HEWEJO|5.0|This movie is a movie you can watch every year, or every day.  It has good values in it that our family need.
B001FB5634|5.0|This movie was rough to watch in some parts, but is not past being real.  It is a down to earth realistic movie.
B001TODCII|5.0|This is a good movie. It is scary to think that it really happens, but makes you hope your dad is Liam Neeson if it happened to you.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|This is definitely a &#34;chick flick&#34; but one that men can enjoy with their &#34;chicks&#34;.  I really enjoyed it a lot.
B00BYISQTO|5.0|Yet again, The National have absolutely succeeded in every sense of the word. After being brought into the fold of their music by 2007's Boxer, and being completely charmed by 2010's High Violet, I was eagerly awaiting a follow-up sets of songs. Everything from this incredible band's back catalog is already boundlessly brilliant, and this album cements itself as another The National masterpiece. Tracks like 'Don't Swallow the Cap', 'Fireproof', and 'Graceless', the more bouncy of the tracks on this album, are absolutely compelling on their own, with beautiful and confessional lyrics, and a rich textured sound, but it's when The National get down to the soft stuff, like 'Heavenfaced' and 'I Need My Girl' that the album becomes a near-perfect record.<br /><br />They got it right again. You may not like it from the get-go, but that seems to be something the National do well - rewards repeat listens. Buy it, listen to it, and love it. This is some of their best work once again, and I can't wait to continue listening to it.
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|it doesnt work right. it kicks me out of the game i cant even get on it. DO NOT GET
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Violent and dark, but still had a plot/storyline. I'm a big fan of Carl Urban (Doom, Red) so I went into the show with a positive expectation. Wasn't disappointed. Never dragged, action packed (pretty graphic at times). Kind of dark, bleak overtones, reminiscent of the original Robocop movie. Remember &#34;willing suspension of disbelief&#34;...loved it.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Wonderful book, great read. I remember reading about these times & older brothers serving in this War.<br />It held your attention all the time.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|Addicted to this game so bad. Can't stop playing it. Completely in love with this game. Wanted to say thank you to Amazon for the coins they have me for evening a loyal member.
B000O14VAU|5.0|I've seen it before, it's a new classic.  The action sequences are great.  I'll watch it many more times and I won't grow tired of it.
B004ELSDZK|4.0|Great game for training your brain, that is wery funny too. And when you find solution you say to yourself how easy it was!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Very good book to allow us to know God is always hearing our prayers for each other. New exist an Dr s should except this fact

B00BWBHIUG|4.0|NOT FOR SMALL CHILDREN AS I THOUGHT BUT I'M HAVEING FUN WITH IT ALL THE WE SAME. BE CAREFUL THOU DOES COST TO ADVANCE.
0525478817|5.0|This book for me is what An Imperial Affliction was for Hazel. I can absolutely read this novel over and over again, yet never quite be able to explain to someone why I enjoy it so much. Never before has a novel brought me to tears, yet made me smile at the same time. John Green is a phenomenal writer, and this novel will not disappoint.
0810989956|5.0|I bought 2 for my twin boys.. and they love them!  They take them in the car and even to the bathroom!

B00000G3AZ|4.0|I read the novel Emma by Jane Austin in school and ever since I had heard there was a movie to it, I'd been so anxious to watch it! I'd been searching for it and when I saw it on Amazon I was so thrilled and purchased it right away. It came in soon and proved to be a good buy. My sister and I enjoyed watching this movie, it has a great storyline! Loved it!
B0095P3ULC|5.0|I think that this movie was one of Michael bays greatest movies that he made.  I gave it a 5 star because of the soo much action in it, and it being on 3d.  It was definitly a great movie.  I own it on 3d and its just great to have.  Anyone who likes action and loves, that turn into robots would love this movie.  Go out and buy it.  That's what I did.
0789324563|5.0|When I got my book for the dark knight. It gave me soo much more information about the movie, and bought me deeper into the triolgy.  That's why I gave this book a 5 star.  Christopher Nolan is a wonderful producer, he's one of my favorites.  Thank u for sending me a great item.  I love this book.
B00C7KYXHW|4.0|Excellent new series. A strong cast and interesting, well written storyline. I look forward to seeing how it continues to develop.
B005JS7VTQ|5.0|The Price is great, the package is great and the music<br />is greater, Great Doobies sounds and some great songs that make no ones song list today UNLESS you have these albums.<br />Yeah, I still say albums!  Great guitar, percussion and harmonies along with great lyrics-get it now!<br />You get a lot of the Greatest Hits but also those other gems that made this band so good and so cool!
1885167776|1.0|The author takes an old idea, prioritizing, pushes it to the extreme, and laces it with dramatic stories about success.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This is a great book!!!  It is so funny and different than other romance novels out there as it is told from the<br />from the man's perspective....and the sex scenes are smoking hot!!  I really like Drew and I was routing so hard from him in the end!!!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This is a well designed application.  It's intuitive and informative. I recommend this app for anyone looking to be informed about the status of their battery charge.
B00B04KVMC|5.0|love this show.  A great addition to anyone's vinyl collection. I gave as a gift for several music buffs. Love
B00B2TTVNU|3.0|I was impressed with the piano skills of Ms. Valentina. She has fine skills and has demonstrated them with fine performances of an assortment of compositions written by an assortment of composers. This CD, however, leaves a good bit to be desired. I was not satisfied with her interpretation of Rachmaninoff's music. I thought she played too slowly in sections of each concerto, and really too rapidly in others. In some cases the distinctness of the notes in her speedy runs was somewhat muddled - I think due to her pedaling. There was little evidence that the soloist and conductor were on the same page. Actually, the orchestra, under the conductor's lead, seemed almost frantic in too many of the passages, and Ms Lisitsa was dutifully following that tempo.I was quite disappointed in the conducting, and the orchestra performance because of it - and even the performance of Ms. Lisitsa for the same reason. They were not in synch, played too rapidly, and the music suffered for it. For instance, the third concerto was performed in some 39 minutes or so whereas other performances by other orchestras/soloists were significantly longer. To whit: Andre Gavrilov's great interpretation of the 3rd under Riccardo Muti and the Philadelphia Orchestra - over 45 minutes. A six minute differential between two separate performances of the same concerto begs the question, \\"Which performance was the more accurate interpretation of the composer's work?\\" I think that in this case Mr. Gavrilov and Mr. Muti win such a comparison.  Note: I am not a concert pianist, nor conductor. I was trained in classical piano studies for some years, by two products of the New England Conservatory, but was never a concert pianist. In my 79 years of life I have heard many performances by many performers and orchestras, and I call upon my thoughts and memories of such performances to make comparisons between them and the more contemporary performances. I also well remember discussions with my mother as we spenthours listening to an old 78 recording of Rachmaninoff performing his 2nd concerto, which she saw him play in Boston in 1920 or so. She would discuss selected passages, and mention how he looked as he performed these passages - his melancholy facial expression in the second movement in particular. A fascinating lesson by a professional pianist/organist product of the New England Conservatory. In conclusion then, I thought these performances were in need of improvement. I probably will not listen to them many more times.
B00B2YH7BS|5.0|great gift for music lovers.  A good video that I will watch over again.  And I gave it as several gifts for the music lovers in my life!
B002FHJ4B2|5.0|I've seen this movie many times, but this is the first time in the 2000's.  It's still an outstanding movie.
B00B23O97Y|5.0|great Clapton, and a good addition to my vinyl collection.  I also gave as a gift to my son as well.
B002LFCPLO|1.0|I have never given a one star for anything before but<br />the language and overall worldview was very<br />distracting from the possiblity of a good movie.
B00CRWJ7VC|4.0|While this movie bites off a little more than it can chew at times, overall it is a tremendously entertaining film which makes you think outside the box and place a new perspective on life.<br /><br />Thoroughly enjoyable and would recommend to anyone but Fast and Furious fans.
B00AZL3PBK|2.0|the reason i gave it 2 stars is because of unresponsive controls.  i am using 1st gen kindle fire and the controls lights up but doesnt register.  if it gets fix it, ill update mh feedback
B00AYXNKIC|5.0|I love the older versions of this game, but this one actually tops them all. It is pretty hard, but there are four different sections that have levels and you really get your money's worth on this one.
B001NIAQ9I|5.0|Loved it. Great music and songs. Story line was  very moving and endearing. Will watch it over and over again. I mean no one ever gets tired of hearing Barbra Streisand sing. She was wonderful in the acting too.
B000SGSU58|5.0|I really enjoy this author and would recommend to everyone.  I can't wait to read the next book in this series.
B0000046KM|5.0|You are laying on a lush, grassy hilltop with your loved one. The scent of lavender is on the breeze, and the  cumulus clouds are gently drifting by overhead. It is a perfect day. And Shirley is singing to you and yours, this magnificent album.
B000I3SYEI|3.0|Went to see the newest Star Trek movie with my two kids.  We all enjoyed the new movie but my husband and I appreciated some of the parallels between the new series, the old movies and the original TV show.  This movie is dated but  I would recommend watching this movie before seeing the new Star Trek movie.
B008BU75IQ|2.0|Think I've read every book Lord Archer has written, and I must say this one is so far off his normal excellence that I am reluctant to recommend it even for a long train ride (if there still is such a thing).  For me the book is terribly irregular, jerky even in its fits and starts, and badly edited on top of a bad plot.  I simply couldn't buy most of it and the number of illogical bailouts of various characters borders on the ridiculous, especially the (to me) almost silly Argentina half of the book.  I can't write more because it would be adding depression to an already depressed piece of work.  Sad.  Lord Archer should get his ducks in a better row before trying again.  Too bad he can't scrap this one and start over.  Fie.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|when i received the dvd I could hear it moving around inside. During the shipment it popped out and I was worried it would be scratched and wouldn't work. I emailed the company i bought it from and they said that if there was anything wrong they would let me return it. Luckily nothing was wrong with the DVD and it works great. It was comforting to know that even after I took it out of the original packaging I could still return it!
B0040HO01Y|4.0|It is an interesting and warm film, and I will suggest people to watch it. Good for family and fun.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|Django Unchained had everything I want in a movie.  I will be watching this movie again and again.  But maybe not again then for a while, but then yes, I will watch it again after that.
6304490119|5.0|I lost my old disk of this movie, wanted to replace it. It is one of my top ten in science fiction movies.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|Even more creative than Enders Game. It will be something to see movies created from all of these books.  On to the next!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Love the interaction. Have to use brain and think. Very enjoyable. Highly recommended<br />Reminds me of the old game myst
B005544TRQ|5.0|This is a great show. Every episode was fantastic. Would recommend to anyone who loves great television. You need to watch this show.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This was my first time buying an app, EVER, and I'm glad that it was this one. I'd watched PewDiePie play this, and as soon as I did, I thought, &quot; I want that game!&quot; Three months later, I did.<br /><br />I love the unlimited possibilities, and the crazy use of adjectives (and potions). I've never played a game where my imagination can run wild like this, either. Hell, this goes BEYOND my imagination, since it has words I don't know too!
B002GKQ5MY|5.0|I like all the L word season & season Six is one of the best.<br />I like the way that the writer use it to end this DRAMA
B00CH87HF4|5.0|great game. the graphics are OK. but they should add more bad guys into the game it would much better and chalenge
B009ZQJVAK|5.0|Interesting, with a good twist toward the predictable end. Liked at actors and theme. Will go and see the play in NYC soon.
B009XTF8JM|2.0|I'm going to get right to the point here. This is not a good movie. It's boring, poorly acted, and completely predictable. I won't go too much into the plot because there are plenty of places that lay it out, but I will say this - when the best actor in your movie is Matisyahu, you know you have a problem.<br /><br />The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because it's so bad it actually becomes hilarious. Scenes that should be scary will just leave you laughing. So if you're into really bad movies and laughing *at* them instead of *with* them, you may get some enjoyment out of this. Otherwise, just watch The Exorcist.
B00CL68NOG|3.0|Predictable... do like Barbra, however, its time to hang it up. nine more words are required here It says, OK?
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|A MUST FOR ALL TO SEE<br /><br />this is a great documentary. I see something different everytime I watch it.<br />Love the concert bonus dvd.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The Hunger Games is a very good book. It was suspenseful and very interesting. I would definitely recommend this book to a lot of people including you! I hope you enjoy this book as much as I did!
159420411X|3.0|Nate Silver is a bright guy. He writes well. He did a lot of research in writing this book, and interviewed a lot of people, famous and not as famous. Even better, this book is about predictions, a subject I have thought a lot about and read a lot about. So I thought I would like this book, and like it a lot.<br /><br />I didn't. The book was entertaining, but not thought-provoking. When sitting down with the book, I imagined it would be like eating a full-course meal. Instead, it was like eating just a dessert. It was a good dessert, and there was plenty of it, but I wanted meat, and I wanted a salad and soup. Some substance to go along with the sugar and spice.<br /><br />In that sense, this book offers the same things, and lacks the same things, as a few other books I have read lately. In each case, a bright young person writes about an eye-catching topic with a crisp, catchy title and gains lots of readers by telling stories. There is background, there are facts, but the heart of each book is in the stories.<br /><br />The trouble is, you can support any argument that way. For example, in [[ASIN:0307352153 Quiet]] and in [[ASIN:1400069289 The Power of Habit]], the authors use the same story -- the personality of Rosa Parks, most famous for sitting down on a bus and refusing to budge -- to make contrasting points. In Quiet, Rosa Parks is said to have been an introvert, who was forced to give up her preferred privacy to take a stand against racism by publicly sitting. But in the Power of Habit, we hear about how outgoing Rosa Parks was -- her husband said she had such a big social network that she ate most of her suppers away from home.<br /><br />The Signal and the Noise is a lot like Quiet and The Power of Habit. Nate Silver tells some very interesting stories, and promises to tell us how to separate the signal from the noise and predict the future. That's enticing, because we crave predictability. We hate that things -- important things -- happen randomly, for no real reason. We want effects to have causes. Good things should happen to good people, and bad things to bad. Always, and without fail.<br /><br />Instead, randomness rules. Randomness is not a bug in our lives, it's a feature. And we hate that. We want every success to be a triumph of the smart over the dumb, the disciplined over the carefree, the strategic over the happy-go-lucky. We hate the fact that success is a function of randomness.<br /><br />We want there to be a signal hidden in the noise. But most of the time, when it matters the most, there is no hidden signal. There is just noise.<br /><br />So I thought Nate Silver misled us readers. His book is really about probability, not prediction. Had he told his stories, and made some powerful points about probability, that might have been a better book.<br /><br />But he didn't. He just told stories, stories that he implied would help us tell how and when we can sort the signal from the noise. Having read the book and now having put it down, all that comes to mind are a few of the interesting stories. I listened to them, but they did not make me think. They entertained me, they did not educate me. I learned little.<br /><br />What is the secret? I think it is this. The faster the world moves, the more interconnections created, the more chaotic it becomes, and the less predictable. We should not try to predict the future, or use logic to methodically plan our next move. Instead, we should intentionally inject randomness into our actions. We need to have a plan, based on probabilities, but be ready to abandon that plan as the future plays out. We need to double down on good luck, and shrug off bad luck. That's life.<br /><br />We need to put predictions in their place. Predictions are not powerful, they are deceptive. But we can increase our statistical advantage. We can slant the odds in our favor. Given that, a purposeful bet becomes powerful, not because we have distilled the signal from the noise and predicted anything. But because we are sitting at the table, playing the game, and no one who is sitting at home is going to win.<br /><br />We should view the world less like a machine operating according to the laws of cause and effect and more like a game of chance. Making predictions makes little sense. Working to bring about the future we want does make sense. Accept that there is no signal in the noise. There is just noise.<br /><br />For me, these are better books about the perils of prediction, and how we should view the future:<br /><br />[[ASIN:0471358444 The Fortune Sellers: The Big Business of Buying and Selling Predictions]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0525952055 Future Babble: Why Expert Predictions Are Next to Worthless, and You Can Do Better]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:1568583699 The Future of Everything: The Science of Prediction]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:1591844932 The Click Moment: Seizing Opportunity in an Unpredictable World]]icted anything.

B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|I liked the book because of its right perspective,<br />and I consider it a must as much as for parents (and grandparents),<br />as for politicians. For parents for the obvious reasons. But for politicians,<br />because there is much talk about inequality, as it is certainly a main problem,<br />but it is very easy to through away the public money in programs which won't<br />give the right answers, because of a wrong diagnosis and a wrong understanding<br />of the problem!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Great quality. I love the feel and the motion (the teflon on the bottom definitely helps). The buttons are extremely easy to customize. The side buttons are very easy to click with your thumb. You can also change the light color :)<br /><br />Returns:<br />Anker customer support is absolutely amazing! My first mouse by them was about 3 months old, and the lens started moving independently. After emailing Anker they sent me a replacement with absolutely no problems. It arrived within the week.<br /><br />Best mouse I have ever owned!
1556438850|5.0|This book is a great reference for teachers or those looking to deepen their practice. It's a book that you'll read now and then go back to in the future.
B0056JJ1M8|5.0|Okay - it had a movie type feel to it, but the story was good.  A bit like &#34;To Sir With Love&#34; crossed with basketball.

B008M87GJK|4.0|I like the way news is presented. It´s friendly user and very updated. It´s much better than to watch bbc on TV.
B00BY8DNK6|4.0|Going along with Dio's continued idea of live records being legitimately \\"live\\", this 2-disc set has the feel that only a complete set on a single night can deliver. A little too low-end early on the disc, it makes you feel like you're in the crowd. That's not a fault as it turns out. I seemed to get used to the concert hall sound (the feeling of having that vibrating thunder accompanying the experience) after four or five songs. I don't know if this is me or there were adjustments made at the soundboard, but it is not distracting in the long run. The set is great -- all of the solos that seem to be part of typical 80s metal shows are kept short (4-5 minutes) and fit very nicely into the show. The medleys, which sometimes can be a half-hearted run through of old favorites, are played with passion and purpose here. This disc is a solid four-star ---- this is a tremendous document of 80's DIO. The song selection is cool because clearly this show is in support of Sacred Heart album (it's not a greatest hits show). Craig Goldy sounds good to me ---- It would be interesting to compare this show to one earlier in the tour when they had Vivian Campbell on lead guitar. I was pleasantly surprised by this release.  Rest In Peace RJD.
030746363X|5.0|I learned many new facts about our bodies.  I know these are facts because of the references and scientific data.<br />Also learned how our bodies react to different inputs and stressors.<br />I really liked the factual data the author observed and measured in his own body.
0812983459|5.0|This book was chosen for a book discussion group.  I liked it because it reminded me of my walking trips in England, and because the main character (Harold) found a way to work through the difficulties he had faced in his life while walking.
B00CATSONE|5.0|The first 20% of the book is great but has nothing to do with Tesla. It is about what makes geniuses genius and whether it's something genetic (nature) or a set of skills that can be understood and followed by others (nurture). I found this part interesting and wish there was more discussion on it. At the same time I was unsure whether I had gotten the wrong book from Amazon as I was expecting a book about Tesla whereas here the author was going on about geniuses. To be sure I re-downloaded the book on my phone's Kindle app just to double-check I was getting the same book! :)<br /><br />Towards the end of the first 20% the author changes track to say genius is a path and one of the important qualities is imagination and that Tesla's story is a good example of that. And with that we start with Tesla. I found that part great - just what I expected - and felt sorry for him (and pissed off at the world!). Here is a smart guy, discovering and inventing things, but at each step all he encountered was a doubting world and rich enemies who were out to get him. (And it wasn't aided by the fact that he seemed to be a trusting sorts who let people swindle him too. Repeatedly, that too). I suppose if Tesla were to be born in the current age he wouldn't be so dissed upon by his peers and the world in general. I guess.<br /><br />The Tesla story goes on to about 85% of the book. After which it switches track to creativity (which is related to imagination) and how one can develop that. There are no concrete steps as such, just quotes from others and examples from more geniuses. It was good reading that but I wasn't too convinced. Taking Tesla's own life as an example, I feel it proves all the more that your nature plays a big role in whether you are a genius or not. Sure Tesla used to read a lot and loved electricity, but he had a good imagination too (or let himself be imaginative & and imagination came to him) and that's what helped him with his inventions and such. I don't think everyone is gifted with that. (At the same time, it is not nature alone. You have to have an attitude/ method congruent with it too that lets you put in hard work & effort and take steps to realize your imagination).<br /><br />Overall, a great book. Got me thinking about genius etc and the Tesla story was a good read. Thanks for writing this, Sean!k everyone is gifted with that. (At the same time, it is not nature alone. You have to have an attitude/ method congruent with it too that lets you put in hard work & effort and take steps to realize your imagination).<br /><br />Overall, a great book. Got me thinking about genius etc and the Tesla story was a good read. Thanks for writing this, Sean!
B00BP4WAZS|4.0|Very well done. Giving it four out of five because 5 stars is for the extremely special films.<br />In the animation category, I put this a step behind Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Up.<br />My daughter loved it, too, so I get to stop watching Hop over and over (Yaaaaayyyyy!!!)
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|One word to describe this game is AWESOME.I love it because it's really fun,free,and easy to play.The object of the game is to press The GASS PEDDLE but not too much or else you will eventually do a flip and break the drivers neck.....
B0089LOG02|4.0|The book starts out in New York as orphans are sent west on trains to be adopted by families in the midwest.  The story is fiction, although the existence of the orphan trains and the fear, sense of abandonment, and cirumstances they met, were real enough.  Some families wanted a child of their own; other families wanted cheap labor.  The story follows two orphans in particular, the families with whom they were placed, and the hardships they encountered.  As a reader it is clear that the paths of the two, which separate, will once again cross.  It is an spell binding read and a chilling reminder of the hard circumstances of the early twentieth century.
B001ANSS5K|5.0|Definitely one of those book you can never put down!!!! It always keeps you on your toes, wondering what will happen next.. Definitely worth your time and money!!
B004J4WNL2|4.0|Ms. Cain outlined, then filled in with detail, the subjects of introvert, extrovert, and shyness in a way that will be very useful.  It is good to know that when a person declares themselves to be sensitive, they are not by contrast telling you that you are insensitive.  The personal examples, and related investigations helped to place the subject matter in the real world.  It was extremely interesting to hear that in the workplace, universities, and religious bodies being an extrovert is valued above performance, education, and spiritual depth in cases cited.  If a person didn't jump on the band wagon they were considered inferior.  If I had an objection to the conclusions stated, it would be that the tone suggested that a shy person was somehow a persecuted minority.  For a person who is neither extrovert nor introvert it is difficult to tell if a quiet person (presumably shy) wants interaction or if they would just as soon be left to themselves.
B003V5CFV8|5.0|I don't know what to say except I love it- the soundtrack is lovely, the writing is superb and the actors create such fun characters. I have used this video for personal therapy in the past.. it always gets me giggling.

B006MW3V6U|5.0|I was very happy to find Downton Abbey Season 2 on Prime. I canceled Netflix because they did not have it.
B0074VA2T2|3.0|This game is not what I thought it would be, I purchased this game for my 2 year old. I thought that he would enjoy it, and it would keep him entertained, when in fact he will only stay active with this for about 2 min. Might be a great app for a little bit of an older child tho.
B00A757EFW|3.0|I found this game a little hard to play on my Kindle.  Guess I'm of the older generation where I still need that paddle to move back and forth.  The arrows didn't let me move too freely.  When I wanted to go up (down, left, or right), it didn't.
B008IJT0CE|1.0|statement of permission : Read only access to phone state.<br />actual permission : Read only access to phone state AND identity!<br />unacceptable and gross mis-statement of permissions. The app seems ok, but I never heard of this dev before and trust must be earned.

009922562X|3.0|The first book in the series is fast pace e and well written.  The author seems to understand the world of Naval warfare. A lot of the background material in the book was based on truth.  It was a enjoyable read, however if you continued into the other books in the series, all the plots were the same. Even the villains were copy cat, we went from a Iranian sub commander to a SAS officer.  The most outlandish issue is that we could keep this a secret from the rest of the world and the public. Good story, but once is enough.
B007JCP8FE|5.0|this is a good album i like the music its amazing. i would recommend this to anyone who likes shinedown.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|The action scenes are so far over the top and so exaggerated that it makes me laugh out loud.  And as before, Jackson manages to ruin the most memorable scenes from the book.  Nonetheless, it was entertaining, and I really liked the performances and imagery.  Looking forward to the next movie.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I find myself coming back to play this game more and more. The more I unlock the better and challenging the game gets.
B0035XVVDY|4.0|There were definitely some questionable, over-the-top moments in the movie, but it was a fun, and at times disturbing, action movie.
B004SIP8SY|5.0|I have been looking for this everywhere. None of the Best Buys had this movie, no worries, i found this on amazon at a price i couldnt pass up. I recieved it, no complaints, nothing but compliments. Brand new and at a cheap price, dont pass up this opportunity.

B00CWVFPGO|5.0|Big fan of Arnold.  Great to see him back in action.  Classic one liners from Arnold.  Hope to see more movies from him.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I agree with most others - this is a great game. Like any phone or iPad game it's a total time killer but anything that lets people take out their aggression by wiping out the entire human race is OK in my book!
B0087HT36U|5.0|The siege hero game is one of a kind most likely for a child to play this game with angry birds in their mind but they are in for a surprise. *pedo bear approves*
B00280LYIM|5.0|My daughter loves the Percy Jackson Series.  She can't put the book down when she gets started.  I started getting them at the library since she reads so fast.  I would highly recommend the Percy Jackson series.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|It followed  very closely to the style of the novel, which is important to me. Excited to see the final two movies in the trilogy!
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Although the book started slowly it built up well and I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />A good sequel to the first book.

B00CL50LEC|4.0|The poor zombie was funny and sad and just wanted to have a friend. I was grossed out when he kept snacking on brains but other than that I really enjoyed the movie.
B005ARYEY6|1.0|I have some other Miles CD's from past years and I loved them, but this just isn't it for me.  I guess this is the very extreme type of jazz where all the notes sound like they are scrambled...there is no melody to it at all.  I have only played part of the CD and am trying to decide if I want to try again, or just throw it out.  To me, it is just &#34;that bad&#34;.<br />I think the music is simply awful.  Very sorry to say.  I just don't understand this type of noise.
B004QL7K6G|5.0|A little hippy for my taste, but funny through and through. Paul Rudd is good. Jennifer rocks! Don't get married!!

B00005JL0I|1.0|Weak as a James Bond spoof and even weaker as a comedy. With this caliber of cast this movie could have been so much more. Not funny like Pink Panther but just a psychedelic waste of time.

B0074QGGK6|5.0|Great little kickstarter to get the creative juices flowing. As a High School Drama Director, I found it to be a great tool ot get my students revved up to bring something more to the table. Wound up giving multiple copies as gifts.
B000YNQXOU|3.0|I enjoy the fusion between strings and rock.  But Bond keeps reverting to a techno-disco sound on nearly every piece on the album.  Almost sounds like the same song over and over.  There are several very enjoyable pieces but mostly I got tired of the techno-disco sound.
B009UAO1ZG|3.0|The book is really well written and holds your interest. But you don't learn that much from it. It focuses more on people and less on how society as a whole was shifting is views.
B007C7UZIG|5.0|If you play computer games how can you not have a Steam account. It's like having a car and not knowing how to buy gas. They have really great sales at Christmas time, they make a boatload of ca$h I'm sure, what I am not sure about is why their big sale only comes the one time a year, must be allergic to money.
B008B1BL4E|4.0|Nothing gigantic that's new in the book. But it brings a very interesting point of view as it focuses on the attitude of each country, and the diplomatic relationships they held with others, and their worries about how those relationships were shifting.
6304806426|2.0|Very depressing!!<br />Two stars for the cast and sets only.<br />Would only recommend this movie for the person who does not mind sad and disturbing stories
B0058SNKRY|5.0|These are my 5th or 6th summer Croc. I love them for touring around when you don't want to wear sneakers but<br />need a good walking shoe. Amazing,cushiony soles!
B00CATSONE|2.0|I downloaded this book (for free) in hopes of gaining insight into NIkola Tesla but I found that the author got lost in all the information he used to support his view.  More directness and simplicity in relaying the facts of Tesla's life and achievments would have contributed greatly.  I have to give credit to anyone that attempts  the task of writing a book.  If I'd paid for the book, I'd be upset over the waste of money.  However, it was free so no loss for me.
B0091WAWTM|2.0|I watched the entire movie and kept thinking it would get better but it never did.  It was just really weird.  It was difficult to follow at times.  I just couldn't get into it.
B004NOH9LC|5.0|good acting - nice story line- great show<br />makes it believable filmed in  New York<br />director keeps up the pace and makes you feel like yo know the characters
B00338QENI|4.0|Very informative and thought provoking. It is amazing to learn how people were treated and are still being treated today by the science community.
B00000JG41|2.0|pointless eclecticism. A little Beach Boys here, some electronic noise there, some fast John Zorn type cuts, a few Arabic phrases, change to a few Klezmer seconds, .. and so on, so on ... very, very funny.
B007EECSFA|2.0|The author had a good idea, but the execution was lethargic. Kind of an interesting twist at the end, but not worth the other bulk to get there!
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|Doesn't matter what season it is. They are all awesome, great character development and complex Story lines pull you in and you don't want to stop watching.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I actually saw the movie first. I thought some of the scenes in the movie were better portrayed then in the book. However, in the book you get the background information so much more on the characters. I thought all the characters were so well written. One of my favorite Nicholas Sparks books!!!
B0087ITBPC|3.0|I was disappointed in film.  I am a huge fan of Barbara's  It is a cute movie I just love watching her but not worth watching again and again like so of her other movies.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I can not wait for the next book to come out this summer.<br />I love this book. My cousin recommended it to me. It was so well written and such a fantastic story of fate. Enjoyed every minute of reading it!!! Great job Colleen Hoover!!!!!!
B0046UGSNS|5.0|A wonderful movie..... the story line, script, and performances were wonderful. Julliane Moore and Annette Benning were supurb....<br />I highly recommend this movie to all......
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|That was a very good book but I'm confused about the ending and issent that the mad painter that got the field but I hop the next book will explain it
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|Was concerned about the film quality for these shows and movies but was very pleased.  The pictures are nice and clear, (not blu-ray obviously) but still easy to watch. The sound is just fine.  We had forgotten how much fun the Columbo series was.  Very satisfied with the set.  We bought it on sale so the price was nice.  Lots of hours of entertainment.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I wish they would have kept this show going :) Great cast & fun storyline that lets the imagination run wild!
B00CW665VI|5.0|For me this is the BEST Male POV of this year.<br />After yoy met Andrew Blake...you will Hate him...then you will Love him...them you will want to kick him and after that...HUG Him....<br />This book is really good because Emma Chase had done a really good job giving us a real men point of view. He is SOOO Honest that is almost RAW....<br />There are real good characters here....His niece ....his sister ...and of course Kate.....<br />BUT...Drew..he is the real deal...you are going to say very often: DID HE REALLY SAID THAT???????????<br /><br />After all of this if you ask me...if I want to add Andrew Blake to my bookboyfriend Long list...<br />OF COURSE I WILL!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />I definitely recommend this book...you are going to laugh...you are going to be mad...but at the end.....LIKE me..You will Love Drew....
0857860801|4.0|There are some cute pictures in here. Every open page is a two page drawing with a bunch of action happening. Very cute.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I think this is one of the shows that deserves and could succeed with a given a second chance. Are you listening Amazon... or Netflix... or someone...
B005SAYRA6|5.0|Never a dull moment... Great movie to watch for the first time or again before Fast and Furious 6... Love the cast!
1416524800|1.0|Don't worry about factual accuracy.  As many reviewers have pointed out, there isn't any.<br /><br />Look for the funny parts.  Or, at least mildly amusing, as with:<br /><br />- the description of Rachel, the heroine, right at the start, the only decent intro of a character, or shall we say, cast of marionettes, in the book. Rachel's intro ends by describing her hairdo as indicating \\"she's smarter than you.\\"<br /><br />- a Team of Delta Force Assassins zooming across north America in a hydrogen powered jet at 2500 mph with nobody noticing;<br /><br />- ridiculous attempts to withhold information and provide momentum by producing dozens one and two page chapters with cliffhanger after cliffhanger;<br /><br />- a gorgeous, Halle Berry lookalike senatorial aide climbing around in a dropped ceiling to move from a bathroom outside to a bathroom inside her senator's office. This maneuver is how she gets into a locked down, secure room. Unfortunately, unlike the other impossible actions in the book, this one's too difficult for Dan to deal with so he neglects to describe it. He gets her up on top of the toilet tank, a good place for her, then, poof, slight of hand takes over.<br /><br />- the entire \\"action-packed\\" ending with dozens of mini-cliffhangers as Dan tightens and re-tightens, and then re-tightens the screws. Time after time, our hero and heroine escape certain death by mere millimeters. It all ends with the miraculous appearance of a rescue helicopter that lifts them out of a raging, super-heated whirlpool which sucks down the research vessel, the attack helicopter, and the bad guys in one big schlup.  The maelstrom is caused by a mini-volcano blowing out 12 miles off the Jersey coast.  Hmmm, yeah, I used to live around there, happens all the time.  I'll say this for the ending - it made me laugh out loud three or four times.<br /><br />However, I did learn something earthshaking from the book. And I can't believe what I learned! It could change everything, or almost everything, we know.<br /><br />Next chapter, please.<br /><br />I learned one of the few standard formulae for thrillers: Chunks of research (accurate or inaccurate) linked together with chunks of ad-copy. And by that I mean every character, every object, every device and every action in the book (except for Halle Berry climbing around in the ceiling) is totally hyped, massively oversold.<br /><br />It's very badly written. If curious, visit the library.almost everything, we know.<br /><br />Next chapter, please.<br /><br />I learned one of the few standard formulae for thrillers: Chunks of research (accurate or inaccurate) linked together with chunks of ad-copy.

B00CFNUMD0|5.0|My only complaint, where is season 3? There should be 10 more seasons of this. Just can't get enough. Very funny!
B004JZBGWI|4.0|I really enjoy this app. Notes, appts. Are all together in one app. Pretty colors too. You can adjust your own font for the letters . Now if  they would add a calculator and less battery drain this app would be even better.
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|This is one of the best  movies in my collection ,further enhanced  by upgrading to Blu-Ray.Although this movie is very sad in parts ,it also is uplifting to see the compassion shown to these poor misplaced people .
B0067EKYS6|4.0|My only concern going into this movie was my memory of what Baz Luhrmann did to Romeo & Juliet.<br /><br />Overall, my fears were quelled after seeing the movie..<br /><br />Luhrmann did a very good job capturing the spirit and tone of this novel.  This film did well in making a visualization of the wildness and sensuality of Gatsby's parties. DiCaprio was well cast as Gatsby and capably portrayed the desperation of Gatsby in his lifelong quest to obtain Daisy.  Tobey Maguire did a good job as Nick, giving us the story as he claims that he feels he \\"watches from both within and without\\" of the group around him.<br /><br />Carey Milligan was possibly the second best portrayal of Daisy that I've seen (behind Mira Sorvino).  While Milligan did a better job of portraying Daisy's unhappiness with her own marriage, Sorvino did a better job throughout of portraying Daisy as the self-centered person that she is, happy with her life until Gatsby re-appears and challenges what she has.<br /><br />The one real complaint that I had with the movie was the music.  It was, especially during the party scenes, very anachronistic. Modern hip-hop songs playing was completely out of place in the 1920s jazz-age.  This largely faded in the second half of the film once Gatsby ceased having his parties and began spending every moment with Daisy.<br /><br />Overall, the film did a very good job of telling the story from the novel and stuck very close to the Fitzgerald's work.<br /><br />4/5
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I'm addicted to this show. I highly recommend it, and I'm relieved to know that high quality tv is still being created.
1444730878|1.0|As we have been told, the book is six loosely connected stories covering six different time periods, past, present and future.  But each of these stories does not really go anywhere, and the connection is tenuous to say the least.  I found this a deeply unsatisfying read.  I trudged through it, trying to get to a point where something significant had happened, but it never did.  I was not transported to another world, I always felt that I was tuning in to someone's desire to see his word in print, rather than being carried along by an expert storyteller.  It is long, so it took a long time to realise I was on the road to nowhere.  I had particular difficulty tuning in to some of the individual \\"voices\\".  With so much \\"dialect\\", parts of the book were almost unreadable.  Maybe it is because I don't read SciFi, and I like Jane Austen.  Not to my taste.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|I was worried, but happily surprised at how good this was.  Cheers for making a great new Star Trek movie!
B002RI9PKO|5.0|It is a great read! Insightful and well researched. I like the message - do meaningful work and when an opportunity knocks on the door, be prepared to grab it.
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|I purchased this for my MBPr.  The Mac only has 2 USB 3.0 ports.  I have the 4 port mini unpowered hub.  It confused me that all the reviews for 5 different devices fell into one place.  Really had to sift through them.  I only got it yesterday but so far so good.  The packaging was very nice, not that it really matters to me.  I just tested 2 hard drives without the hub, then with the hub.  The performance is the same while speed testing the drives one at a time.  If it still works in a few months I'll buy another one.  For now I'll use one of my ports for my HD (USB3.0) and the other port will have the hub attached, with my Roland Octa-Capture, Smaart I-O, and an external mouse.  That will leave 1 port open for the random sticks clients hand me with content on them.  When I get another one, I'll be able to have 4 ports on each side of my MBPr.
B002LANLDK|5.0|Fun, with a lot of excitement and action - there even was a good plot with some romance, sadness, and redeeming qualities.  You mean there is honor amoung theives!
B008LP8QE8|5.0|Harrison's has a long history in many many medical schools. It is easy to see why.  The references are impeccable. It is exceptionally well written.  There is not a wasted word on the page.  I use this reference often as I know that Harrison's will usually have the answer that I cannot find with online clinical references.
B005V5WBFG|1.0|When I 1st got it they locked me out because of my password even tried to put in a new one. I have been trying to uninstall the program with no success.
B005LBF7CY|4.0|Hotel Vendome was a great story. It was interesting to read an unusual story line. I enjoyed the characters and the interplay between them.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This was a great follow up of the first book.  It kept me wanting to read more.  I liked how the plot took twists & turns that were so unexpected.
B00005JLSE|5.0|Renee Zellweger, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Richard Gere and John C Reilly were really great in their roles. I particularly liked the way the musical numbers were staged. Most were triggered by Roxie going into day-dreaming mode; John C Reilly's number being the primary exception.  The fact that all of the singing and dancing was actually done by these actors made it even more enjoyable for me. Catherine won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her performance, and I certainly agree with the Academy on that.<br /><br />View the movie and then watch the extras about the making of the film and about the actors.<br /><br />I first purchased this DVD right after it was released. However, I loaned it out and never got it back. I missed watching it and decided to see if anyone had it available and located it on Amazon. Received it in a few days.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|So I am reading Hopeless for the second time now. YES IT'S THAT GOOD!!! IF I COULD GIVE IT 10 STARS I WOULD!!!! This was the first novel that I read by Colleen Hoover and I'm hooked!! I don't want to mention too much because I don't want to ruin the experience for any one. And it's one helluva experience. This story is one of intense love, self discovery, and perseverance over the unthinkable. Even though Sky and Dean are young, they go through more heart breaking tragedies  in their young lives then most people go through in life time, but some how they manage to get up every day. I loved this story because you never know which way it's going to turn, but after you make that sharp right you wonder why the heck you didn't see that one coming. The way Colleen writes is absolutely magnificent, the characters she creates become real and your sitting there feeling every emotion that they are going through, when a author can make you feel the depth of emotion that the characters went through, you have a winner. I loved all of the personalities in this book and the dynamic that is created. In every way this book was perfect for me,  I tell everyone I know to buy this book because it is worth every penny. SO ONE CLICK AWAY!!!!
B00CMEQD30|4.0|I was totally enchanted by this fast paced story. Tirsa and Artride are such believable likable protagonists with such strong dialogue and chemistry between them. I was drawn in right from the start, always wanting to find out more. It becomes a story of hope, loyalty, romance, trust and secrets. Also today's issue's are dealt with such as child abuse, gay-marriage, death and justice. It is an enjoyable read and never too heavy though.<br /><br />Although enough sword and sorcery throughout the story, it never gets unrealistic and there is only `necessary violence' which I found very refreshing to read in a fantasy book. Especially the climax was very original, both of them! Without giving too much away, I found that the author has dealt well with the struggle between good and evil and she not only leaves you wondering who the villain really is, but also a reason why.Very well written for a debut novel and although the ending was satisfying, there is plenty of material left for a sequel! I want to continue to read about these main characters and the magical creatures of the magical land. More please?[[ASIN:B00CMEQD30 The Queen's Curse]]
B0038TWHP6|5.0|Awesome movie, Liam Neeson played and excellent role. The story line was very accurate and portraits Michael Collins as the great leader he was. The first true president of Ireland
B004YW4L5K|1.0|This was absolutely one of the most convoluted, weird and strangest book I've ever read.  Wouldn't read another by this author.
0545128285|4.0|Unusual &#34;fairy tales&#34; suitable for Hogwarts students.  A little different, but that is to be expected!  Like to find as much background material as possible for this series.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|I wish I had seen it in the theater- this was a very good film.  Casting of some roles could be questionable, but I enjoyed it nonetheless.
B002APU580|2.0|This was OK, but not as great as the TV serial from BBC.  It was shorter (movie vs. series), and some of the scenery was breath-taking, but all in all, watch the series with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle.
B002A4Q652|5.0|I love this CD, good music, great voice, what is not to like.  If you like hard rock with clean lead vocals this is a great cd.
1423136802|5.0|this would be a great novel for any youth<br />good characters<br />moves fast<br />a little bit of everything<br />buy them and share
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|I have not had a problem with this app. It is easy to use and Does what it is designed to do.
0374214913|3.0|there were parts that could have made this a great novel but they missed the boat and went for the bizarre<br />Not one I would recommend
630542845X|5.0|I love this movie. It is very emotional with important messages. It is sad but very satisfying at the same time. Life can be sad at times. I never tire of this movie.
B007PT1PEY|4.0|These are great books. I got these for only 1 dollar with a amazonlocal deal offer. It's on my tablet and I am able to access whenever I want with the kindle app.
0385344333|5.0|So Lee Child needs to get busy and write 20 more. I hate it when I catch up to the end of the series and have to find someone else to read!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Loved the story and the character development.  The characters are multi-faceted and complex which keeps the story engaging and moving forward.
B0077EBWVI|3.0|I actually liked the original better - I didn't think the acting was as good as it could have been
B009JZTOG8|3.0|The story line is very inventive and innovative, I do very much like the story.  The acting is getting weaker as the season moves forward, at times it feels like the script is being read instead of acted. Snow White and Charming are a bit tiresome.
B0052AC8C6|3.0|This was the first movie I tried - forgot I saw it before with grandkids.<br />Once was enough - cute for the little ones
B000AYEL1A|4.0|This movie bring back memories of my youth. This has always been one of my favorites. I LOVE Barbara Streisand I even got my hair done just like her back in the late 70's.
1401326161|5.0|This is a good series and every thing was delivered as requested.  Richard Castle is a good author and I also watch the TV series and enjoy it very much
B00B8XC2O0|5.0|The product was what I wanted. It was a good selection of jj cales songs and I liked it very much.
140011425X|5.0|This is good and the relationships that these characters share is believable and entertaining.  I like mysteries and who done its, and these books supply that interest.
B00CFOXBX2|3.0|This film had many potential moments of great cinema. The cast is seasoned and interesting to watch, but they are what carries the film. The settings are bleak and colorless, the movement in the film is slow and stagnant. These traits may have been the intent, or part of Soderberg's vision, but it didn't make for very engaging visual storytelling. The story itself is timely, I expected a slicker, more time relevant version of Erin Brockovich with Jude Law as the reluctant hero but instead, got a slow paced albeit interesting storyline that had me falling asleep at random moments and missing pivotal information (apparently.) I watched it twice, dragging out the second viewing to smaller bites in hopes I wouldn't miss the details, and in fact there were many I had missed. This is a movie I wished were more engaging and visually stimulating but it wasn't. Jude Law and Rooney Mara's performances were not \\"riveting\\" but did carry the film.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Cool game. Very interesting and tricky, but addicting and interesting. Wish it was longer, but I hope there are tons more in the future.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I'm totally biased, since I'm absolutely in love with this show, and the characters, but this season had some amazing moments.<br /><br />Except for Remember the Titans. The last 5 minutes of that episode was worth watching, but otherwise they botched the lore terribly.
B00755MHXG|5.0|My 10 year old son and I both loved this book.  It is an uplifting and humourous story, and the characterisation is especially good.  We get inside August's head and see how he struggles to make friends, and ultimately triumphs, but we also see the story from the point of view of the other characters.  I thought it was a good book for showing children how bullying or unkindness can affect others, but I also liked the fact that it wasn't preachy at all but also fun to read.
B005SQ3AI0|5.0|I've found that when purchasing music of &#34;yore&#34;, it very often isn't like the original.  Not the case here.  I loved going down memory lane while listening to these songs.  In addition, I got more than I paid for.
B0090X4GJE|1.0|I loved the lights album; My favorite song was number 11 from that album and I buy this without hesitation. Boy was I wrong, all these songs are way over produced and doesn't flow at all. I am disappointed at the fact she seem to only throw this second album out after her short stint of fame came along and she was in beats ads and other ads. It honestly feels like she throw this thing together in a month and then released it like it was a decent work of songs. All the songs seem to talk about the same thing which is &#34;love&#34;. How many times are you going to sing about that? I just don't understand I thought this was going to be something amazing and I was happy finally seeing real legit musicians make it. Then she got to big headed and came up with this crap, I seriously tossed this in the garbage when I went the car was a few days ago because I was just so sadden. I still will listen to the 1st album though but this is just her not even trying anymore because she knows people will still buy her stuff and she has collected all the hardcore fans who will eat anything she sells.
1476729719|4.0|I probably shouldn't have read this book. It was very difficult for me to get through and if the writing wasn't so darn good, I would have put it down. It was also my first book by Jodi Picoult and many have recommended her writing to me.<br /><br />I thought the book dragged at times and thought the trial scene was overly belabored, but that might have been because I'm too familiar with the legal system. I have a child who's different, not altogether dissimilar to Peter. Reading about his miscues and the torment they caused him was painful. The havoc he wrecked on others that grew from his pain isn't excusable, but I was left to wonder the same thing that I was after the Sandy Hook shootings. What, exactly, do we do to stop this cycle of abuse and violence.<br /><br />Time Magazine had an article on high schools several months ago and the authors concluded that they may not be the best fit for everyone in America. Perhaps the time has come to reinvent our school systems and interactions so a more tolerant society can emerge -- if it ever could. Piccoult reflects that when she writes \\"All that, Alex thought, and nothing's changed.\\"<br /><br />A very sad book, well-written, but a little long.
B00A4FOWYQ|5.0|I never wanted to listen to the music videos or see them before actually hearing the songs first for some reason. But I was skeptical when my friend had let me borrow the CD since she had bought it from the store instead of online like I did, but at first I was kind of like eh it was okay; but after a week of listening to it in my car while driving back and forth I ended up actually listening to the words rather than allowing the somewhat decent beats cloud my judgement. But over time I ended up enjoying and singing along in my car, my favorite song is number 3 because it felt personal but I would also say number 9 is a great song as well. But the overall album is great and it goes smoothly together. I also love the album cover as well as the cd cover meshed great with the entire CD cover and songs. I deeply enjoyed and will keep enjoying the next work they create.
B005LAIIFS|5.0|thanks Easter bunny for bringing this movie to the kids. Great family movie for movie night. the eggs were a cute bonus.
B008602KQI|3.0|There could have been more character development, and a better setup, but the movie is ok, and slightly entertaining..but painful at the same time....
B000FBFN1U|4.0|The plot is still running its course and I enjoyed this book more than the second, but here again my beef lies within the layers of details upon details. Once again armor and locations are described to an infinite degree that borders on boredom. On the flip side, when there is action, there is definitely some good old fashion action. Not to  give any spoilers but during one fight scene involving Sandor Clegane as I was listening to the audiobook while driving. I literally said, \\"Oh s***\\" aloud.<br /><br />As I mentioned in my review of A Clash of Kings, G.R.R.M. is persistent in his attempts to sway my feelings on characters he has created. Once again, I will reference The Kingslayer. I can tell he wants me to care for this character and begin to root for him, but I won't. I don't think I will ever be able to get past the idea that he tried to kill a child on purpose. The same goes for Sandor Clegane.<br /><br />On another note, I still find it funny that it is constantly said over and over again that \\"winter is coming\\", and the only thing that has happened after nearly two years of story progression is a slight chill in the air. I'm no true genius when it comes to weather patterns,  but  when it is supposed to get cold, it gets cold over a period of a few weeks not a half a decade. This autumn in the books has lasted nearly three years already. So if this is the case , then then words on the lips of the men and women in these books should be more - \\"a long autumn is coming and then the winter will come.\\"<br /><br />Honestly, at this point I don't think I need to create another replica moment from A Storm of Swords like I did with A Clash of Kings. It goes without saying that G.R.R.M has again gone into alarming detail regarding every aspect of the book. If anyone is reading this review, that should be a little hint of how story writing should go. I gave the large swell of a detailed summary last time; there is no need to put the reader through it again. G.R.R.M should take note of that!<br /><br />A Storm of Swords ends very well with a long list of happenings, which caused me to greatly look forward to the next book, A Feast for Crows. I have heard rumors that the fourth is by far the worst in the series, at this point I am 40% done listening to the audiobook while I have been busy painting my house.  So far the only upset that I am encountering is that it seems very much Lord of the Rings with all the walking, riding, rowing, sailing and traveling to destinations. I do understand that traveling from one end of Westeros  is supposed to take weeks, but I really don't want to experience it myself. I would rather just \\"get there\\" quickly. Every writer should have strong points, and I guess they come with weak ones as well. The story telling is good, and the action is usually never too sparse, but it is not a stretch of the imagination to say that Martin's vice is without a doubt way overboard when it comes to descriptions. His other vice is having other characters bite the dust too early for reasons unknown. Without giving too much away, there is another particular fight that involves Gregor Clegane, and something happens at the end that made me say, \\"REALLY.......REALLY.......that was just dumb and stupid!\\" It made absolutely no sense and it reminded me of an old 80's horror movie, where while watching it you are screaming at the main character \\"DON'T GO IN THERE, THE BAD GUY IS GOING TO GET YOU.\\" And just to spite you or piss you off, the main character goes in and BAM, they're caught off guard, etc.<br /><br />All in all, and this is beginning to be a growing trend with the Song of Ice and Fire series, but I give this one a solid 4 stars.  It loses one star yet again for making me feel that there is a super awesome 700 page story between the 1,216 pages of this novel.A Storm of Swords ends very well with a long list of happenings, which caused me to greatly look forward to the next book, A Feast for Crows.

I do understand that traveling from one end of Westeros  is supposed to take weeks, but I really don't want to experience it myself. I would rather just \\"get there\\" quickly. Every writer should have strong points, and I guess they come with weak ones as well. The story telling is good, and the action is usually never too sparse, but it is not a stretch of the imagination to say that Martin's vice is without a doubt way overboard when it comes to descriptions. His other vice is having other characters bite the dust too early for reasons unknown. Without giving too much away, there is another particular fight that involves Gregor Clegane, and something happens at the end that made me say, \\"REALLY.......REALLY.......that was just dumb and stupid!\\" It made absolutely no sense and it reminded me of an old 80's horror movie, where while watching it you are screaming at the main character \\"DON'T GO IN THERE, THE BAD GUY IS GOING TO GET YOU.\\" And just to spite you or piss you off, the main character goes in and BAM, they're caught off guard, etc.    All in all, and this is beginning to be a growing trend with the Song of Ice and Fire series, but I give this one a solid 4 stars.  It loses one star yet again for making me feel that there is a super awesome 700 page story between the 1,216 pages of this novel.
B004LWZW4M|5.0|The best planet of the apes movie yet James Franco was at his best Caesar was the winner in this movie
B0017O1MIM|5.0|spectacular film, great packaging. A definitive masterpiece I'd recommend to anyone. Definitely worth the asking price, the book is especially great and the film frame adds to this great edition even more.
B008IYR2BA|5.0|The best!  I am always intrigued!  I love the easiness of logging into my account and Dexter Season 6 is always there.  Love my movies in the cloud at my convenience.
B0017OB12O|5.0|What an amazing film this is. The digibook packaging only adds to this release and the film itself is a pure masterpiece.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|On the surface, this game is basically a cooler temple run, but there is a story to it and as far as I can tell you can process without paying, although it would be easier with cash.
B000QRIGJY|5.0|I'm a mystery buff.  I have not read any of Connellys' books.<br />But I received a hard cover from my friend.  Now that I am on<br />Kindle, I have ordered more of his books.  Love his style.
B00280LYHS|5.0|Okay, I don't want to waste your time, but this book was completely awesome! I will NOT be a spoiler and tell you every single detail. I would only get this book once I read the other four in the series. They are, in order,<br />The Lightning Thief<br />The Sea of Monsters<br />The Titan 's Curse<br />Battle of the Labyrinth<br />I enjoyed this book and hope you will too!
B0089LOG02|5.0|I can't say enough about this story.  Loved it.<br />The history, the connection between the people.<br />The descriptive tales between good and bad foster parents.<br />I would recommend this book to everyone.
1938469003|5.0|Its the best book on beer knowledge I have ever purchased.Its a very in depth book and gave me some great background on IPA's (obviously). And some great yet simple recipes.
B0058ZZDVS|3.0|For just another liberal fallacy/fantasy show it's actually pretty good. If you are going to watch tv you need to be able to let the far left talking point subliminal messaging that is weaved into each episode kind of go in one ear and out the other anyway.<br /><br />Watch for the routine anti-conservative/anti-republican jabs that serve no useful purpose to the dialog other than it probably accurately represents the leftist types that are being portrayed. The invariable Bush slams are added for dialog fillers. All this leftist messaging is really ingenious if you think about it.<br /><br />Watch the show and enjoy it for what it is... entertaining leftist buffoonery.
B000093BDX|5.0|Listening to this CD will bring a smile to your face! Great old Beach Boys tunes. Use this CD on a long, summertime drive, and you'll think you are heading to the beach. Just a great, fun-filled CD.
B009AMANBA|5.0|I love history and Steven Spielberg makes it come alive in this movie. Daniel Day Lewis was superb as Lincoln. He made me actually rethink my feelings about Abraham Lincoln whom I now appreciate much more.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|This book is seriously one of my favorite books of all time!! So cute and adorable!! Agh Chung cjrh dj dj
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Incredible movie, exciting, interesting in every detail. I cannot wait for Part II and Part III due out this year and next
B00006CXSS|5.0|This series comes in a metal container (as shown) and is made of good quality.  I think it adds to the appeal.  I bought this as a gift set for my husband and he was very happy with them.  I think I bought these as part of a lightening deal and got them for an awesome deal!
B00BTJMS1A|3.0|The game itself is very addictive- I lose track of time (and wasted too much this week) trying to finish it- and I would have given up much sooner on other games, so that's a good thing. But the graphics are awful, the tips are useless, and there are no instructions, so you find yourself using unrecognizable tools, trying to meet incomprehensible goals, with unpredictable results. It took me days to figure out that what I thought was a sponge was a loaf of bread- and what it did. I had no idea what a &#34;ranged monster&#34; meant. There are surprise attacks and effects that happen too fast to figure out where they came from. You eventually do learn how to progress, but be prepared for a lot of frustration when your game ends for no identifiable reason, sometimes very quickly, when you are expected to move faster than possible, and when you can't understand or meet your goals. The 2 minute timer also doesn't seem to work, and some levels don't give you the right monsters and tools to meet goals presented there. With a disclaimer that maybe people who play similar games intuitively understand what is required better than I do (first timer for this sort of thing), I think that if they provided directions and improved the graphics, this could be a 5 star game. Given, some surprises are a good thing. But basic things like knowing how many levels the game has, understanding your tools, and being able to identify your objectives are necessary- and missing here.
B001N9ESQ4|4.0|I stumbled upon this series from seeing the latest one (Before Midnight) coming out to theaters soon.  I looked online about that movie and discovered there were 2 prior 'episodes'. Before Sunrise and this one.<br /><br />I was surprised to see the original was done in 1995 and there were the same actors in each!<br /><br />I figured watching the first two prior to seeing the latest one in the theater was  necessary so I invited my GF over for a night of movies and dinner.<br /><br />The movie is very interesting - very long shots of interesting conversation and no car chases or unrelated drama!
B007TKT2SK|4.0|Save yourself $50 and buy this app for .99 My daughter needed it for school and it does the job quite well.
1401324649|5.0|How to tie the history of a century into a book that is fun to read? This one does it. I could not stop reading! Moore!
0439023491|5.0|When I finished the Hunger Games,  I was actually excited to start reading Catching Fire because of how good the first book was. This was a great follow up of the first book. It kept me wanting to read more after the end of every chapter, and I couldnt stress that more. The last sentence of of every chapter was a hook. I really liked how the plot took twists & turns that were so unexpected, especially the ending. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes adventure, action, and romance.
B009PNQUXO|2.0|It is.alright but you don't need a you tube app since you an just go on the web and search you tubr
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Very sad to see it all come to an end after over twenty years of memories.  Great book, very fast paced and the culmination of all the plot lines.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is the best game I've ever played. What I want is the new update 0.7.0 the internet says it comes out today or this week
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is good short sci-fi story. The story is quick paced. Some concepts were hard to visualize, but the movie might help with that.
B00AE9UYJ4|2.0|There really isn't a lot to this game. You don't have any idea about how close you are to being dead because there isn't a healthmeter. It's hard to move around in buildings. For the most part I found this game a waste of time. I goofed around with it for an hour and got bored with it. Basically you just walk around picking up notes (which have no real use in the game) and try to avoid the slenderman.
B008NMT684|5.0|something to occupy little minds that is quiet and also a good learning tool. Use of fingers to move puzzle pieces .This is wonderful.
B009XWD02G|4.0|II like it cause it can be quite convenient. I love music and i like the new s***. MP3 downloader will keep me coming back for more.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|easy to use with the bigger numbers and always at your fingertips, Can calculate  at any time especially while reading so you don't have to stop and get calculator
B006LSZECO|2.0|I bought this because it was at the top of the best seller list for some time.  Mistake on my part.  Obviously others liked this book a lot more that I did.  I just didn't get far enough into the book to be able to fairly rate it.  As far as I got, there were just too many complications for me to want to deal with.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I have a coworkers who have this on rhwr iPhone and loved it so I got it and I all so love it
1416550550|5.0|This is the fourth book I've read from this author and she doesn't disappoint.  I enjoyed all her books but I believe this one is the best.  I don't want to reveal any details that would spoil the story for other readers but let's just say that even though it's a slow start, the book will hook you and you won't be able to put the book down.
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|I can never imagine living through a journey of this magnitude... Makes me appreciate what I have and realize that all of my problems are tiny... Uncle Ray I think u would &#34;enjoy&#34; this book!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|A Dance with Dragons takes us from one side of the Narrow Sea to the other, from the Wall to Westeros, rollicking from one character to another.  George R. R. Martin spares no characters, no matter how much we love or hate them.  Each chapter leaves us hanging:  What did he mean when he said Brienne screamed one word?  Was she dead?  What about Jon Snow?  And where is Sam?  What part does he play in all this?  And what's happened to Peter Baelish and Sansa Stark?  And will Mance Rayder be saved once more, this time from Ramsay Bolton?  Will Ramsay get his just desserts?  Will Daenyres rule the Seven Kingdoms?  Will this Winter be the worst?  I join my tenant, with whom I discuss the books as often as we would discuss the news of the day, in urging the author to finish and publish Book Six.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Very good read. Never knew this author. I will look up to see what else she wrote. You will enjoy it.
B00499LTLM|5.0|Short and sweet - loved it. The writing. The actors. All of it. Very enjoyable, all around...and now I know about Benedict Cumberbatch - I'll be keeping my eye out for him (starting shortly with Star Trek, Into Darkness).
B001RTSPVY|5.0|Arrived quickly and product as described. This show is so addictive and I haven't been able to stop watching. I recommend it
B000VHVGM8|4.0|Enjoyed this when it first came out and enjoyed it again. Very funny movie. Wonderful cast. I can imagine all the laughter on the set while filming.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|My 4 year old stepson is obsessed with Jurassic park, so this app seemed perfect. Great for children with the assistance of an adult. I actually like the game so much, i play for him while he's at school.<br /><br />Pros: Great graphics, Great gaming concept<br />Cons: Sometimes it will say \\"error loading profile\\" & I have to restart my kindle. Money is hard to come by & there's a lot of wait time. Also wish you could add people who aren't you FB friends to your park.
B001EC2IXK|5.0|Newman delivers one of his finest performances in Cool Hand Luke, with a great supporting cast including George Kennedy & Strother Martin. Luke's non-conformist, anti-establishment role is perfect for Newman.  This movie is full of memorable scene after memorable scene. Who can forget the egg-eating contest, or the car wash scene, or the &#34;shaking it off, boss&#34; scenes, etc.???  The fight scene b/n Newman & Kennedy is also unforgettable.  And, of course, the oft repeated, &#34;what we have here....is a failure to communicate&#34; line.  My personal favorite is &#34;stop feeding off me!&#34;.  Anyway, this belongs in every DVD collection, esp. if you're a Paul Newman fan.  Timeless classic never gets old, even after numerous viewings.
B004I744AS|5.0|This dictionary is easy to use and great features that allow you to find words even when you are not quite sure how to spell them.
B00AJAFNIA|5.0|I am very happy with the game.  I like the bonus store. it has held my interest for a week.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Love almost everything about it. My only complaint is that there is not any health objects to pick up during the course.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Totally awesome I love it I could play for day's<br />Add I love getting new prizes and getting coins<br />I would recommend it
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I was really pleased with this product. It is a less expensive way to obtain all of the Potter movies to have them on hand. I would definitely recommend this product to any &#34;under budget&#34; Potterhead.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book is special. Read it only if you can stand the beauty and horror of the human heart. To all who suffered during WW2 my heart sings for you.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|if you like history you will like this.  Covers a side of Lincoln not usually seen.  watch it watch it
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I cant stop playing it!  Lots of fun. Same idea as most phone apps, but the visuals are so pretty &amp; I love the music from the movie.
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|enjoy able and good portrayal of hitch.  watch and decide for your self.  watch and decide for yourself.  okay okay
B0083P1QUM|4.0|The wonderfully talented Patricia Cornwell has treated us to another<br />Kay Scarpetta mystery, it moves along better than a few in the past,<br />all the characters in their places.... although I wish Marino would<br />shape up.
B0010VD7EO|5.0|Okay! I am listening to this cd now and will give a review. These kids are good and remind me of a 70's band. Watching every movie from 2007 - 2010 always had their songs or a similar band to promote its move. I just finally found out who this band was and got the cd on todays date. My review will be a 3 songs on this cd is a most and always play to remember the journey and old times in our lives. I will give it 5 stars because those 3 songs that moved me will go down in history in my book.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Great Series, always delivers!  Very well written and extremely well acted!  Always look forward to it!  Hope the keep making this great series!
B004ZQBOXC|5.0|When hearing this fun and silly song ''I work out'' was a hell no cd to purchase. I have giving it a try and i play it 3 times a week. I love this cd.
B00003CXCT|5.0|My all time favorate trilogy, it's the best space opera ever, plays well, no problems it's a great story and all three in one volume.....
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I thought that the book was excellent and exciting and I think that others will say about the same thing
B004J4WN0I|5.0|Fun read!  Oberon is hysterical.  Enjoyed the whole series so far, impatiently waiting for Hunted.  One of the best books I've read in a very long time!
B00APJLFEG|4.0|Middle-Schooler niece chose it on an Auntie/niece sleep over.  I intended to call it a night, but listen to beginning and niece's giggles brought me around to delay sleep and thoroughly enjoy the animated movie.  Storu complete, sincere, and in some cases a little mature for niece, but only briefly so.
0385342063|5.0|I am really enjoying this book. In true Kinsella style, it's witty and funny and I can totally relate.  Good bedtime reading after a busy day.  Or a good beach book.  I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Lisa<br />Fresh Eggs Daily<br />www.fresh-eggs-daily.com
B004DLPXAO|3.0|Love my Kindle device itself and for ease/convenience put an app on my phone for occasions find held up but w/o Kindle to help pass the time.  The entirety of my Kindle Library is present, do wish that as callupon from what reading, the app could/would pick ip as and to page, chapter read through.  Having Android App (and iPad 2 App) syncronized to Kindle device use (and likewise, if read past point on an App, device synced to spot last read.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|As usual Ken Follett's amazing attention to detail places you in history. We all know the story but Follett is able to immerse the reader back in time to pre world war II. The variety of the various characters enables you to skim from country to country with detail to politics and diet!<br />I ended the book with a desire to read what the third book will bring.
B00846REIS|3.0|Written well, just too familiar to Fifty Shades. Very easy fast read and the female lead isn't as whiny but the breakups and relationship running get tired. I'm waiting for the characters to develop further in the next book.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|I really like this game the graphics are good and the controls are good also compared to other shooter games, the enemies are similar to galaga where they follow each other in a line. Overall it's a game i recommend buying.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|This game is so good not even considering it is for kindle. I mean the graphics are amazing the controls are so easy. I love it. I can't stop...HELP ME STOP!!!
B004AO1FF6|5.0|What a great show! Every season just keeps getting better. Any fan of sci-fi, well cheesy sci-fi, should definitely check this out.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Where is 0.7.0 it said it would be released in April but now it's delayed to May. Seriously it's May 29!!! I can't wait for buckets. I also can't wait for online multiplayer because pockettool won't work!!! So plz update!
B004EPZ034|5.0|My son love this movie!  The price was comparable to the stores but was able to get free shipping since my order was larger.  Thanks!
B0076DEJMO|4.0|I have to be in the mood for Abercrombie and I was when I read this book.  Yes, it is a western in medieval fantasy clothing, but a good one!  I like how he continues to use and build upon past characters.  While it may stretch belief, it continues to build characters and plays with the notion of intertwining fates.  I've read the First Law Series and Heroe's and I am reading Best Served Cold now.  For me, the inclusion of Logen made this neck and neck with Heroe's.  It is, of course Dark, and bloody, and theatrical, and if this is what you are in the mood for, well done.
B001AG52AG|5.0|I read the books when I was younger, and obviously, the movie is not a perfect representation of the movie. But if you can separate the two, I think you'll really enjoy the movie!<br /><br />Also, it isn't attacking christianity... especially in this movie. There is hardly any mention of the &#34;Church&#34; which is called the &#34;Magesterium&#34; in this series. Only if they had been allowed to make the second or third movie, you might have had to worry about that.
B00CWV8TIU|3.0|Very slow start. Nice twist but so many plot holes and unrealistic conclusions. But it did what it was meant to do and that was to entertain.
B00BRBIA6C|5.0|I've been listening to \\"A\\" for over a week now and I have to say, I haven't \\"absorbed\\" a new album like this in a very long time.  The album is beautiful - absolutely stunning, and I genuinely mean that, not just because I'm a \\"fan\\" (for lack of a better word).  Agnetha's voice sounds almost exactly the same as it did years ago, and it's as strong as ever.  It's truly wonderful to hear her sing brand new original songs again.  The songs were obviously written with her in mind, and they suit her perfectly.  I really love them!  Despite it being a mostly mid-tempo affair, the album is certainly not dull nor too syrupy.  It's nicely balanced, and the songs are just fantastic.  \\"I Was A Flower\\" and \\"Should've Followed You Home\\" are standouts right now for me, but I love the whole thing.  Agnetha, Jörgen Elofsson (songwriter/producer) and Peter Nordahl (arranger) and the rest of their team put together a wonderful, melodic album, so well done everyone!  Here's to more success for \\"A\\"!  I'm going to love this album for years to come.  Thank you Agnetha!  :)
B00006EXDM|3.0|In spite of the &#34;Official Seal of Authenticity&#34; that came with this, the acoustics on it are really horrible, leading me to think it must be bootleg.
1476712042|5.0|This book had me addicted from the first time I picked it up! I read it in three sittings and would definitely recommend for a day at the beach.  It is exactly as promised,  a beautiful disaster!
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Lots of customizations available. Excellent story line that I cannot wait to advance further.  A nice crawler for those of us addicted to killing monsters and picking up loot...
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|I had read the book first, so I was especially excited in seeing the movie.  I was not disapointed, I dont know how they acheived it but it was true to the book.  Great Story
0345494997|5.0|I have heard of Frank Lloyd Write and figured he was a stuffy architect who liked clean lines.  Boy, what a revelation.  Usually, I look up people while I read about them-for some reason, I didn't and I was swept along his life story with his illicit love affair.  I don't want to give anything away, but this novel was a page turner with a surprise ending I totally didn't see coming.
B009X01FJS|5.0|The marware revolve Portrait and Landscape standing case if very efficient. I love all the features, especially the handel in the back it is very convenient when reading a book.  Also love the 3 positions for landscape and portrait.
B0042AGNC8|2.0|I can find the regular edition of this Blu-ray just about anywhere, and for cheaper too.  I placed my order because it shows the Blu-ray Essentials slip cover, and the main review was for the \\"special edition,\\" strangely not calling it \\"Blu-ray Essentials\\" by name.  I received the regular copy of the Blu-ray, not the \\"Essentials,\\" and will be returning it immediately.  Don't place your order if you are looking for that version pictured, this is not it.
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|Before I saw this movie, I had ZERO interest in Star Trek. It seemed as if I didn't understand what the hubbub was about. Then I saw this movie with my Dad and I was amazed. It's a tight 2+ hour movie that spares no expense on action and thrills. Kirk and Spock bickering is one of the best things about this movie, and that's the verbal fireworks! Without spoiling the movie, and the inevitable slam-dunk Blu-ray release ahead, let me just say that theatrically this was a delightful film!
B006IMY5ZU|4.0|Moneyball was worth it<br />A good family movie to watch<br />Great punch lines, out of box thinking, good acting, conventional end
B004C3DLJS|5.0|Love this movie! It is so cute and funny! Very appropriate for young kids and adults will like it as well!
B00CE03UOC|5.0|great fun for everyone. graphics. are great easy to follow. like how the puzzles. increase to be larger and harder
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|I love match 3, I love this game, it goes on and on, and I like that.  I hate the games that you do and you never complete something.  This one you actually are completing something.
B002PMPTIO|4.0|We seldom purchase movies, but in this case, I suspect we'll want to re-watch as subsequent films are released.<br /><br />This is an enjoyable take on the original Star Trek story. Nothing earthshaking, no new character development. It feels comfortable, but with enough upgrades in technology and effects to entice new viewers to the franchise.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I don't like some of the recent changes, but on the whole I like Facebook because it helps me keep in touch with people that I knew in the past, especially people I had lost contact with.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Can't wait for the next room!  Very challenging and fun!  Lots of twists and turns.  Keeps you on your toes.
B0043JDUNS|5.0|I really liked this movie, it's actiony yet funny and Robert Downey jr. is like the best ever. He makes the movie!
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|I am not the only one that plays this game.  My child does as well.  Great entertainment!  Something that the whole family can enjoy
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|The author vividly illustrates the challenges a DevOps responsible is facing and outlines in an easy to read novel different facets of process issues they encounter.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Think of Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn in \\"The Wedding Crashers\\" or any comedic movie of that genre.  The hero, Drew, is a chauvinist, but once he meets the heroine, Kate, he re-thinks his philosophy on women.  At first, I wanted to hate Drew, but then I accepted his flaws which was easy to do because he was destroyed by love in the very first chapter. From the start, the reader sees him at his worst and watches as he redeems himself and wins back his girl.  The chemistry between them is hot, and it's fantastic to watch them verbally spar and reach a scorching crescendo to a romantic kiss.  Loved it!<br /><br />Although some readers criticized how Drew speaks directly to the reader, I, on the other hand, liked it.  It felt very personal, as if I was his friend and he was telling me his pathetic story of redemption.  It wasn't distracting at all, but rather endearing.  It was his journey of redemption so other characters' point of view was unnecessary.<br /><br />It has been a long time since I laughed out loud when I read a book.  There are so many funny lines.  The dialogue and thoughts are what people think and only tell their closest, and most forgiving, friends.<br /><br />The only thing that bugged me was a consistent grammatical error that I have recently seen in books: \\"There's my parents...\\"; no, \\"There ARE my parents. \\" Or, \\"There's many...\\"; no, \\"There ARE many....\\"  I'd cringe each time the author would make this elementary school error. Where was the editor?  At least the author  didn't make the mistake of saying \\"these ones\\" which would have really set me off.  It's \\"this one\\" or \\"that one\\", but never \\"these ones\\" since \\"one\\" should not be plural.  Unfortunately, the misuse is making its way into common speech.<br /><br />Nevertheless, the book reads like a movie.  Sometimes it's over-the-top as movies often can be.  It's fast-paced and funny. The characters were amusing.  A must-read.  I enjoyed it and read it a second time.
B007T99ENE|3.0|End doesn't maintain same momentum/interest as the first three-quarters of the book.  The end frustrated me so I wasn't happy when I finished it.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Superb acting by Daniel Day-Lewis. He was incredibly believable as Lincoln. Also great supporting cast, notably Sally Field, Tommy Lee Jones, and James Spader. Spader provided comic relief during a very serious subject. Congrats to all for making the passing of the 13th Amendment exciting to watch. Great for history buffs and anyone who wants to learn more about Lincoln as a politician.
B000002A46|5.0|This is one of my favorite holiday disks, probably in my top five. I've had this CD forever (that's exactly how long-I HAVE the actual CD-lol!), but I have since ripped it to my MP3 player.<br /><br />I'm not a huge fan of modern \\"pop, R&B, top 40\\" artists, but this disk really blew me away. Of course Ms. Carey has a beautiful voice and can sing however many different octaves, but the GREAT thing about this disk is we get to hear her beautiful voice without drowning the songs with looooong vocal runs. Her runs are lovely to listen to when doing a live performance, but I think most listeners (and professionals) would agree there are times when sweet, melodic tones are better then power runs. For this collection, she still uses the power in her voice, and she does a great job balancing it on her holiday tunes.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|great plot - ever so twisting - you never know what is going to happen next. the characters are solid - they are great
B00985E3UG|5.0|This is a well researched book. I bought a copy for my daughter and she loved it too. I also got the audio so i could listen while driving and working in the garden. The book really encourages one to be more vigilant about what one eats. I have grown a lot of what I eat for a while now, and plan to continue.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|Even if you were unsure about the spelling of a word, you could start the first few letters and options would be listed.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|I totally love this game its worth the money you have to Pay for it the only down part is the supernpong download it took me overnight to download it completely and it kept stopping and I had to resume Itna million times.
B000FBJAEG|3.0|The beginning of King and Maxwell.  Complex tale keeps you involved.  Good plot, though some motivations questionable.  No weirder than the daily news.
B004TI1WME|5.0|Very useful app. Let's you check your inputs so you are sure of your results No more words left to say
B00AS1Q8FW|4.0|My whole family liked this movie. I have a very large collection of movies and this was a great adition.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|Really neat. I wish I had something like this when I was struggling with fractions in school many years ago
B00BN3DPQ4|5.0|Another addition to my great collection of movies. We sat down with pop corn and loved all the action this film had to order. I am not sorry I purchased this movie. I do make it a rule to rent the movie before purchasing because a lot of new movies are not worth the money, even $20 would be to much and a waste of time.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book told of God's love and pursuit of a discouraged scientist,neurosurgeon.,\. It illustrated hoe God deals with individuals right where they are in the circumstances of life. Seeing the way He works in individual lives in many different ways I received hope that He will work in lives so dear to me,in His time and way.
B009LS4KM6|3.0|Again, this movie sports excellent animation. But, the twists and turns of Horton's adventure were jumbled and in some cases long and boring. The climax of the movie is decent at best. An animated film buff must see, but I found it way too complicated considering the simple, lovely original story.
B00AYLTXQC|5.0|I really didn't know what to expect with this movie, but it was touching, interesting, and funny. After watching the movie, I did some more research on this true story and started to realize just how amazing this man's life was. It was a great investment of my time to watch this!
B00BSBXZDY|3.0|Story is lame. But, the quality of the animation and occasional humor make it watchable. Not the best, but certainly not the worst. If you have some time to kill and your kid has seen every other animated film in the universe, watch this.
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|Not a terrible movie but not really my cup of tea. Seemed long and drawn out at times. The visual effects are great and make up for some of the bad points of the movie
B007N9FKCY|3.0|This game is a total Mario brother knockoff. Good enough to make it kind of fun. Fairly simple to use. If you are an experienced Mario brothers fan, you will hate the &#34;rip off&#34; quotient. If you are a casual Mario brothers player, you might like the game. In all, it's okay. Give it a spin if you are looking for a new app.
B0000A0DRY|4.0|At its unveiling this record must have seemed unique and special. But I have always thought it was overrated. Sure it has the trilogy of great songs `Somebody To Love', `White Rabbit' and `Today'. But for me there is too much blended pop folk mixed in with the rock.<br /><br />Unlike say, the Beatles, Stones Cream or Doors, this album does not open with one of its strongest songs. Instead it starts with the oddly named `She Has Funny Cars'. A simple drum beat leads us into a mid tempo rock song that has nothing to say and never really drives us anywhere. The music just is not good enough to make up for the vapid lyrics. `Three Fifths Of A Mile' is another oddly named song with nothing to say. But this time a good beat and nice guitar work make up for the disappointing lyrics. But right when the guitar solo gets going it ends, never being as good as it could have been. 'D.C.B.A-25'. Huh? Another oddly named song, this one is actually very pleasant. This is a good mesh of folk rock, pretty singing and poetic lyrics.<br /><br /> `Somebody To Love' is and always was a standard bearer of classic rock. Thus it is the groups' iconic song. The lyrics are timeless, while the tone of the guitar solo snaking its way to the end, speaks of music's modern future. `White Rabbit' is of course the groups other icon. Translating \\"Bolero\\" and \\"Alice In Wonderland\\" into the sixties sound, it is both dense in atmosphere and full of imaginative lyrics. `Today' is one of my all time favorites. Immediately mysterious and distant, it gives the impression of an achingly lonely soul spilling over with emotion, yet it is hauntingly beautiful. To me this is the best song they ever created.<br /><br />`Plastic Fantastic Lover' is a song that never reaches its potential; it rambles along and just ends. It has nothing of the bite and rock that it would have when done live. This is typical of the albums fault to me. It does not know if it wants to be a folk album or a rock album, so it tries to be a combination of both.<br /><br />`My Best Friend' and `How Do You Feel' are the type of folksy pop that the Mammas And Papas would do. They would be fine on an album of related songs in the same style, but here they water down the rock that is being built up. `Comin' Back To Me' is borderline good, but just reminds me too much of Bobby Goldsboro, which is not a good thing. I don't dig the folksy stuff so this decision to blend the two styles dilutes the album for me.<br /><br />And `Embryonic Journey' seems totally out of place. It would have functioned better as an opener or coda.<br /><br />So while at first glance this looks like a fantastic album, upon playing it I find it to be an overstuffed pillow. One with too much stuffing.a combination of both.<br /><br />`My Best Friend' and `How Do You Feel' are the type of folksy pop that the Mammas And Papas would do.

B00BUCXVPI|2.0|Invincible and genius 5' 7&#34; guy. Ex-military forensic and sleuthing genius foils bad guys. Kicks the crap out of them and never musses his hair. Tripe. tripe and more tripe. If you are bored out of your mind and are a Tom Cruise fan and want anything from a movie in the way of characters or dialog, watch this. Otherwise, watch Sons of Anarchy instead.
B008KMHFJY|4.0|Interesting quirks and humour.<br />The characters are good, and the situations interesting, actions believable, I actually thought this might be written by a male author as it seemed fairly limited in the emotions dept.
B008K8H9C6|5.0|Easy to use and clearly explanatory game. Decent graphics but very good game. Challenging in later levels and lots of thought provoking fun. My four year old loved it.
B00866H7SS|4.0|i enjoyed this a lot, I like the characters and their hang-ups. I liked it enough to buy the second in the trilogy and order the third. Someone else commented that the ups and downs were a bit too much, and I tend to agree, but I assume this was also the plan of the author, I bought all three, so it obviously worked for me.
B00BWU2EMO|4.0|It is standard formula shoot em up. Good guys vs. bad guys. The story has been loosely culled from the gangster history of the LAPD (if I remember correctly). The movie is pretty good for what it is. Don't expect deep thought provoking dialogue or beautiful cinematography. It is gritty and intense. Very violent but without being gratuitous. If you like this genre, you will love it. If not, you will still be reasonably entertained.
0205313426|5.0|My advisor suggested me this book. It seems like the bible in academics. Every graduates deserve one and read every month.
B009K2SLYG|4.0|Those English charlatans put together a reasonably coherent comedy about the quest for the Holy Grail. Still a lot of fun. Quite a few belly laughs, but also some seriously incoherent silliness. You either like Monty Python or you hate them. Me, I like them, but this movie is not for everybody.
B000FA675C|5.0|I downloaded this book by promotion code, so it was free. It was awesome, especially after you watched the movie and read it again.
B009CGKW10|5.0|Great movie. Great actors. Interesting subplots and of course, VERY COOL DINOSAURS. This movie was ahead of its time and is still great fun to watch.
0307895475|5.0|Great like always fast an on time<br />I needed this guide bad Skyrim is an epic big game over 50 hours of side an cave quest that doesn't even touch the main quests
B0085YNML2|5.0|The little lizard that sucks down the targeted bugs with relish. Your job. Get to the bugs by using your head and tongue.. Lots of fun. Highly recommend it. My four year old loved it.
B00008CLOA|5.0|Dark Side Of The Moon is arguably one of the greatest and most influential albums of all time. It includes their hits Time and Money which are excellent but my favorite is Us And Them. It was one of the most well performed albums musically and lyrically. It's one of those albums I can listen to alone or in the car and enjoy it just as much. Final Cut is an excellent record but not very accessible, you'd have to listen to it alone to really enjoy it. Like I said, Dark Side is a perfect album for anytime. It can even be overlooked now days with all these newer bands but it will hold up better than 99% of them. I've even forgot how great it is, several times after not hearing it for a while. If you don't already own it, do yourself a favor and buy a copy.
B00A0R42L6|3.0|The story is the same as the other Ice age franchise movies. I find them somewhat dull and slow. The animation is great and the action is fun to watch and seamless. This movie was made for fans of the franchise (which I am not). So if you like the Ice age movies, watch this otherwise I recommend any &#34;Wallace and Gromit&#34; movie instead.
0786956291|5.0|I started out on 1st Edition. 1979 and into 2nd edition for most of my game play years. I looked at 3rd and 3.5 but did not play or care do it much. I wanted to learn 4th Edition version and found that this is a Awesome peace of teaching material for learning 4th Edition. Plus everything that comes in the box is very nice. No cheap stuff here. I thought the dice might be cheap plastic, most likely. But no they are real dice, the dice I got are black with white numbers. I very easily learned 4th Edition on my own, through this STARTER SET. I am very glad I did. No I am not selling my  1st or 2nd Edition.

B008HK3XKO|4.0|This is my first purchase for a PDA device, so I can't compare to other products of this kind. I am a laptop end-user (my surfing includes TV, news, videos, et al.). I like the compact design and the access my Kindle Fire HD 7&#34; has. I haven't started to fully use my Kindle, but I am little disappointing in the Dolby sound quality, one of the main reasons I purchased this particular PDA. Other than that it meets expectations for entertainment and business purposes.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|The author was very good at keeping you interested in the characters life stories.  However, except for the probability of the young girl's foster care experiences, there were experiences that stretched credibility...  but isn't that the joy of fiction?!?
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I have read many, many books... but this one I will never forget. I have no words to explain everything this book makes u feel throughout. Please read this book... for yourself.
B005J2V74C|5.0|If you are looking for a scary B movie, this is a good one.  It was definitely scary and my husband & I weren't bored at all.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have it for my kindle iPod all Apple products and comp and Xbox 1 I tried it AWESOME GET it worth it stives!!! :) love from accelerate02
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I am a lot like Pat Peoples....I want silver linings and literature that makes the world the place my optimistic heart wants it to be! Though his real silver lining was so different from what ihei imagined...I loved it nonetheless!
B00005LK94|5.0|I had purchased it for my brother who is disabled and loves the film. He wanted it for his dvd collection. He'll watch it about once every two weeks. Great price and quick delivery. Thanks alot!!
B000FCK8ZK|5.0|Great book, I've already seen the series so I'm glad it's different. Very suspenseful! Characters are written very well too.
B000L53D4O|5.0|This walker was all it was said to be, my grandson is enjoying it very much on his visit to Australia and it has been easily folded down and  shipped to New Zealand with ease.
B006H5120E|5.0|My daughter-in-law and I watched this movie last night and I couldn't believe how much the 3d has added to the movie.
1623420148|5.0|I had a great time reading this book. It was fun, funny and surprising. And Drew, the main character and narrator, the Magnificent Bastard that he is, was a breath of fresh air.<br /><br />The book is a contemporary romance novel. Drew and Kate the h/h are investment bankers. They meet, fight and fall in love.<br /><br />What makes this book so fun is that it is told in the first person POV of Drew. Drew is a slut and a pig. He is an jerk. He is also funny with a lot of wry, acerbic and snarky observations. He is a high class, Armani wearing, super confident Dude-bro. He is glorious.<br /><br />I also liked that the author had Drew break the fourth wall and talk to me, the reader directly. I loved that the book was peppered with \\"Don't look at me that way\\" or \\"What? did you think I'd gone soft\\" little remarks directed at the reader that makes you feel like Drew is confiding in/gossiping with you. His observations about men and sex and how men think about women and sex that sprinkle the book border on the cliche and crude. But they are delivered with such verve I couldn't get mad at him.<br /><br />This convention could have gotten old or gone horribly wrong. But it didn't. The author kept it from going stale because Drew's tone hit all the right notes. It went funny to pathetic to 'don't judge me!' to snarky, to cynical to conceited and back again. There is not a page that went by that I didn't want to quote something.<br /><br />Normally I would be a bit more critical of the book because I don't think Kate is as clearly or cleverly drawn as Drew. You also have to question why is Kate able to to affect Drew so deeply when by all accounts he is a supreme womanizer. This is never effectively answered really. But since this is Drew's story and it is his voice,I was comfortable seeing her through his eyes. To him she was the perfect one. His dream girl. Just right for him in every way. The why this is becomes somewhat irrelevant. It is the truth because Drew believes itto be. And I liked how he fell in love even if I wanted to hug him and then punch him in turns.<br /><br />The supporting characters are excellent. His best friends feel like they would be best friend with Drew. His family dynamic is awesome. The scenes of his family's Thanksgiving Dinner is laugh out loud hilarious. His relationship with sister and his niece are absolute stand outs.<br /><br />Great book. Highly Recommended
B0034G4OYK|5.0|This is such a great movie, and being in 3d just makes it better.  I ordered it for my Granddaughter to watch when she come to visit, but it seems all of the adults want to watch it also.  Grandpa doesn't seem to mind that he has had to watch this movie about 10 times.
B002PMPTIO|5.0|After seeing the latest Star Trek movie, I re-watched this after the fact. Man, it's really good! I love having a bit of back story behind the crew of the Enterprise.<br /><br />I was a little shocked at the new Romulan look, being a fan of Star Trek: The Next Generation, but viewers have to keep in mind this is an &#34;updated&#34; take on the Star Wars series. If you are willing to accept the character nuances, then you'll love it.
0385349831|5.0|This is my first Paulo book and I was pleasantly surprised, very entertaining! I started the book and couldn't put it down, it was page by page fabulous!
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|I always like films about redemption and a happy endings.  This is probably judged as a &#34;chick flick&#34; by many, but the acting is superb and the story line should appeal to anyone.  A good depiction of the struggle with mental illness, although it's fairly mild.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is one of the best free Solitaire apps out there. It' just the most basic version and only one version of the game is played. You really can't go wrong and will enjoy this apps version of Solitaire.
B008Y7IP0S|4.0|Good Movie. Nice story seems a little dated. This movie now almost 30 years old now so. Pat Morita givesan  excellent performance
B0002VFXFE|5.0|only brand of cpu paste I trust,  never dries out, even coat, pulls the heat away and easy to clean up if needed.
B00296A4F4|5.0|I love Glee and especially the first season.  I have watched the episodes many times and they never get old.  If I am in a bad mood or have had a bad day I just watch the episodes and all is cleared up.
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|This is a nicely designed, compact, Led and battery motion sensor. A great buy for your money and very effective for lighting up a dark stairway.<br />Because it has Led's there is very low drain on the 4 AA battery's. The light remains on as long as there is movement. If your looking to light up a darkened location in you house once in a while, then this is what I recommend.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Great story lines in this show.  Enough backstabbing and intrigue to fill a stocking cap.  Looking forward to season 3.
B00COGY2P2|4.0|I'm not crazy about Cruise movies but this one produced an interesting main character I could care about and the action actually was necessary to move the story line. sbd
B003M70O5O|2.0|Come on!  I mean, really?!?  I would love to read a review by a 1% biker, or a cop who's busted outlaw bikers, but from a layperson's perspective, this doesn't wash.  All of these crimes committed in the close vicinity of local and national law enforcement personnel would have landed these incompetent boobs in the slammer, half-way through the first season.<br /><br />Katey Sagal's performance is engaging, though, and kept me watching several more episodes than I would have, otherwise.<br /><br />I'm halfway through season two of &#34;The Shield,&#34; co-produced by Kurt Sutter, and so far, I've been able to suspend my disbelief re: Vic and the Strike Force escaping justice, despite having IGs breathing down their necks.  Vic at least has Bondian competence, unlike our scruffy SamCro pals.
0802473156|4.0|Go into reading this with an open mind, and you will be amazed where it takes you about sharing yourself with another person.  My girlfriend and I certainly have different love languages, and this book has opened my eyes into how I can effectively share my love with her.  The book focuses on how to share/speak the different languages, but equally important is how to understand that love is being communicated in other ways, even if not your primary; it may help you better understand your partner is sharing it.
B005COO1X6|5.0|Classic SK! Has a bit of supernatural, extraterrestrial and in the end, the kid saves the day! A great, quick read!
1449437524|5.0|I love The Oatmeal. Awesome and funny comics that I can get behind. He does many funny things to help charities when people attack him and he posts so many great comics. My dogs act just like the dog in this comic all the time. I read the comic online then pre-ordered this as soon as I found out it was being released.
B008RA3X5E|3.0|This app doesn't provide a method to disable the alarm if you get up before the alarm activates.  Presentation is good but entire app could be better organized and friendlier.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|As strange as this can be.. i have never read this book before.. ( and i read almost everything) this is a book that makes one think.. they all got what they wanted not knowing that they all had it in them in the first place...<br /><br />The reason i started reading this book was because i was wondering what if anything poor toto wanted.. come to find out he didnt talk but if one follows the story you can tell that all he wanted was to be with dorothy... this is a most read not only for a child but also for adults... in a strange way this story gives you hope... hope yal enjoy it as much as i did...
B000A59PMO|5.0|My dvd set was a little dinged up but nothing too noticeable and I love it so much I could care less.
B00C4YZ12C|3.0|Not bad reminds me of galaga. For you younger people that was a arcade game in the 1980s. This game is worthy of a 3 star rating, not high tech but fun.
B000NA2BEU|5.0|Love this season, though the Set's case was a little dinged up, all in all it is pretty awesome. ♥
B003TH14H4|4.0|While I still enjoy the acting and character development, some of Castle's 'habits' are wearing a bit thin. In some episodes, he's become almost a caricature of himself while the other characters seem to be developing and growing. I still enjoyed every episode (have not seen them all as of this writing), and in spite of Castle becoming more of a brat than a playboy author (perhaps because of his developing relationship with Beckett?), I was still on the edge of my sear for the two-parter (&#34;Tick Tick Tick&#34; and &#34;Boom&#34;).
B000FL7CAK|4.0|Love this season. It is amazing. The product itself was a little dinged up as well as one of the DVD spots had a broken tooth so it won't hold one of the disks so I have to put it in another spot. That is the only real thing that is wrong and kind of makes me a little peeved about it. But I love the series so I've dealt with it.
B003THHIEM|5.0|Okay, I admit it - I started watching Castle because I enjoy the types of characters Nathan Fillion plays. But I stayed for the interesting scripts and Stana Katic's acting. If you enjoy crime dramedy this may be the series for you. I especially like the relationship Castle (Fillion) has with his daughter (Molly C. Quinn) and his mother (Susan Sullivan).
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|So awesome I can't stop playing it<br />Sweet<br />Awesome<br />Great game<br />Good<br />Nice<br />Awesome games<br />You just can't stop playing<br />Jumbo<br />You can't believe what you're playing<br />Totally awesome<br />I can't believe it<br />Good<br />Sweet<br />Super awesome
B004ELSDZK|4.0|This little game offers a mental workout but (so far) is not so difficult as to be discouraging. The little character/narrator offers strange and sometimes humorous comments, and the game seems to operate without any bugs or glitches. I especially like that one can move on to another portion of a level (or stage?) if stuck. No real reason not to give it five stars except that it doesn't have the 'wow' factor of bigger, more complex games.
B007RCJNDE|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the whole series and the last book Memory of Light did not disappoint maybe the fighting could have been a bit shorter (remember I'm female) but I sure others would disagree.  The way it ends perhaps another book!!! I hope so
B007BVOEPI|3.0|Okay, so I know this is a big hit series and all, but after a few episodes, I wearied of all the murder, rape, plotting, and mayhem. Yes, life is brutish, mean, and short (see Hobbes), but it somehow becomes more depressing when it made its transition from print to film.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Best show on tv, can't get enough. This season has a great arc with a great ending, can't wait for it to start back up
B001EBV0MG|5.0|I have this movie on DVD (just can't get my hands on it now) and the special features were revealing. The cast talk about how Paul really led everyone to give their best performance. George Kennedy was his finest and ironically their characters started out not liking one another. Just do yourself favor and watch it. The moral message is just as relevant today as it was in the 50's.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|My husband loves it to go with band of brothers gave it to him for anniversary he is watching for third time
B0085OELXK|5.0|This is a must see if you are a fan of Matt, Gwen, Phillip and of course Jude Law. There are lots of surprises and total suspense.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Much more fun than I thought it would be. Very challenging. Glad I got it. I am glad that there are so many options when it cakes to your characters and your gear.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|While it is obvious if you reduce your caloric intake by 20% or so, you will probably lose weight. The trick is to find something that works and is maintainable. The FastDiet really works for me. In a couple of months I gained back 2 notches on my belt and it subtly changes your regular eating days portion sizes and the foods you eat almost unconsciously. Probably not for everyone, but it certainly worked for me.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|I got this case for my daughter for Christmas.<br />She decided to put it up until summertime and use it around the pool.<br />When we took it out of the package I noticed the screen had bubbles in it, and when we tried the water test it leaked.<br />After contacting Life Proof we found out from the serial number that it is a fake knockoff.<br />It has been too long so I cant return it.<br />Very disappointing.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This novel was heartbreaking yet uplifting. It is appropriate for teens and adults alike, probably resonates more with adults who have children.
B0085OEIOC|5.0|This movie is absurdly funny. It a no holds barred laugh fest. This movie is great as long as you don't take it or yourself to serious.
B00BUT5IAC|5.0|I will say the I am a huge Alice In Chains fan and have been since 1995.  So I am biased when reviewing said band.<br /><br />I have been anticipating this album since the release of Black Gives Way to Blue.  Alice in Chains found great footing with that record and I highly enjoy it. Upon my first listening experience I thought It sounded in places like a Cantrell solo album but I have backed out on that thought.<br /><br />The moment I heard Hollow I knew this album was going to have potential. After each song played I thought \\"this is so Alice In Chains\\"<br />At this early point I am feeling it even more than BGWTB and that is saying alot.<br /><br />This record has some very moody sludgy numbers as well as some acoustic tracks.  It really had a nice flow.  A couple of the songs were more immediate to me than others but after a few spins those tracks also fell into place.<br /><br />I think AIC have really made a great record adding to their legacy.<br /><br />The bottom line; We all miss Layne and his voice was the soul of the band but they are marching on and creating great music and Duvall really is coming into his own with the band and that is awesome.<br /><br />NOTE ON VINYL EDITION<br /><br />What is up with the price of this vinyl? Completely insane.  The best price I have found was from Amazon UK.  It was $36 shipped to the USA for me.<br />I also saw it in FYE for $59.99 its a double picture disc with the cover on the LPs and it has that red see through LP sleeve for the effect.
B005PK57IK|5.0|Especially like Calinda and her related story line and the quirky Eli Gold. Will continue to watch when the next season becomes available with our Amazon Prime membership. Best season yet.
B00C4YZ12C|2.0|I'm sure it is a good game, but I happen to be 64 years old, who grew up on pinball, long before there were hand held games. I tried it and like Pac Man, I just couldn't get into the game.
B009AMAGXK|4.0|I have not read the books. That being said, I actually liked the movie. I thought the story line was very interesting. I have always been into the casters/witches type plots. I thought the characters all were good. The only thing I did not really like about the movie is there was just not enough acting magic going on. I think it would have been better if we could see more of what powers people had and I feel like the movie needed more information about the powers themselves and where they come from.<br />Overall though, I was entertained by the movie and I would buy it as well as watch the next in the series.
B007MCTTHY|3.0|I found no problems with this game except after a few times I was sooooo bored. Did not keep my interest at all.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We are starting on Season 3 and are hooked on Downton Abbey. Season 2 was terrific. I will be sorry when we've seen all the episodes. It's like reading a great book!<br />I would recommend it highly.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|It does glitch once in a great while... I shut off my Kindle fire HD and turn it back on and it was all straightened out. It might just lag sometimes in closing a song (kind of what I figure). I have saved a few of my fav's off You Tube and opens full screen when it plays back... excellent quality... but I suggest when saving a song, save as MP4 (640x360) seems to be the best qulaity.
B005XLN97M|5.0|My daughter received this for her 8th birthday.  She has not stopped playing with it.  Her nine year old sister loves it, as well.  It is easy to put together and has lots of accessories. The price is great.  Yes, the main wall is printed cardboard, but it is very stable.  I would recommend this product.
B008I3RARW|5.0|It was hard to get a hang of the control at first but even when I crash, it's pretty funny. I enjoy this game!
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|This was a fun read with a satisfying conclusion. Mr. Child makes annoying technical mistakes throughout the four books I've read so far, but I keep picking up the next one.
B00AE9UYJ4|2.0|I just did not like this game. I found it to be kind of strange and it did bore me. I don't have lots of time to spend on a game. I need to be able to either do some and save for later or finish on the spot... this is too time consuming for me.
B00466HM28|4.0|my son loves it and enjoys playing with it, was compatible with his laptop and has had no problem at all
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I have had nothing but problems with this app. I deleted it. It is glitched and was screwing up other things.
B005HJ6MRO|4.0|still has glitches in which if you open a movie it does not allow you to stop it you have to close the entire application and at times it freezes your kindle. however, it is a very nice way to share pictures and videos
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. I never tire of it. It has amusing points (when the guard catches ya) he grabs the character by the ankle and carries him off. My grand kids love this game too! Also, lots of missions and things to buy to increase your character.
B004XZR63M|2.0|Doesn't really state anything new that a halfway intelligent person already knows. Rambles on a little bit when telling a story about whatever habit he is trying to teach.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|This is good for jotting notes down and organizing them by subject. Endless notebooks to begin so you can have several topics going at once. It has a feature to lock it down so no one else can read.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Game of Thrones Season 2 captures the essence of the book while condensing down the characters and avoiding the boring points of the books.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|One of those movies I would deffinitely see again. Good real action camera shots!!  Story line held my interest!!! Believable!!
B006O7XOOW|1.0|My son does not like this toy for the amount of money paid I would not recommend it. It is very boring and the balls never fall into place you just end up chasing the balls so they don't get lost.

B00CW665VI|5.0|Loved it it was so good to get a chance to read from a man's perspective it was ,witty ,clever halraios and sexy Omg heart melted at his words you won't be disappointed with this book ;)
B009NY43NY|1.0|This book was everything I wanted it to be. NOT!<br />I was extremely upset with the feelings I got throughout this book because I already knew how it was gonna end but I had to keep reading, it was like torture! I actually became numb while reading because I had to transition so much for the change, I can only hope the totally off track show True Blood will stay off track for the end. In the love department of the book I am utterly pissed. All I can say without any spoiling.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I LOVED this book.. so much, that I read it twice in two days and it was just as funny the second time around. I loved the characters, I loved the humour and I loved the fact that it was told from a man's point of view. I read this on a flight and laughed out loud, much to the amusement of my fellow passengers. I even had a crew member ask me what I was reading:)<br /><br />Fabulous book, fabulous author... will definitely add her to my ever growing 'must read' list of authors.
B008XG1X18|5.0|better than facebook!!! Love it!  Have found so many interesting ideas that have helped me in so many areas of my life!!
B00AG297GK|1.0|Too much nudity, bad words. profanity.<br />I thought it was a movie appropriate for the all family, but i was wrong.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love this book, it is well written and is appealing to those that want a love story with a twist.

B008IJT0CE|5.0|First time reviewer.  So very glad this app came as the FAOTD. I liked the free version, but this one is a million times better. Worth the money but awesome it's free. You can mix sounds and their volume, set a timer, so many many choice of what sounds you can choose. It's impossible not to find one that will fit you. I'm a choir and forest rain kind of girl.
B004R1VXYU|5.0|Was what my son was wanting
B00351YEZS|5.0|Stephen Hawkins takes those big mysteries and made them even bigger. but your questions will be answered after some pages.<br />This is a book you just have to read to understand!
B0094K1WZE|5.0|I never watched any of the MI movies over the years. A little bored at home with the movie list, I thought I would give this one a try. This movie was one of the best movies I have seen all year. For those of you who love action movies with good writing, and excellent acting - you will LOVE this movie. Action every moment of the movie, what a thrill!
B001DM1VXE|1.0|Plot could have been very good.<br />But it was done in a artsy black and white with the jerky camera shots which was extremely distracting.
B00APJLY0Q|4.0|my daughter and grandson really like this movie and I am looking forward to getting to watch it. Hopefully soon!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Well written, wonderful fantasy novel. As almost always, the book out shines the hbo series with its detail and imagery.
B00CRS88IO|5.0|What a magnificent and sparkling new espionage novel in what promises to be a truly remarkable new book series.<br /><br />Ian Fleming is world known that the creator of James Bond. What is less know is that Fleming had his own daring and dangerous experiences working with British Intelligence during WWII. Thanks to the sterling writing skills of Damian Stevenson, \\"The Writer has become the hero!\\"<br /><br />The Ian Fleming Files:Operation Armada has all elements that continue to keep Fleming's Bond books as popular as ever. Razor tight prose, fascinating characters like Colonel Remy, Eddie Watteau, Rene Melik, Denise Astier (and even a splendid turn by Noel Coward!)and a plot line that absorbs the reader from the first page. The writer creates a truly accurate wartime atmosphere..one can almost feel the London fog! All of the diverse locales are perfectly rendered. This book is a winner in every way!<br /><br />I am so pleased that Mr. Stevenson plans more novels in the Ian Fleming Files series. The Ian Fleming Files: Operation Armada is a hard act to follow, but given Damian Stevenson's abundant skills and knowledge,I have little doubt that...to quote the most famous wartime movie..\\"This is the beginning of a beautiful friendship\\"<br /><br />A JAMES MASON COMMUNITY BOOK CLUB MUST READ<br /><br />RICK FRIEDMAN<br />FOUNDER<br />THE JAMES MASON COMMUNITY BOOK CLUB<br />flag
B00746O3X8|5.0|I bought this because when I 'm taking pictures I have my dog on a leash and need a way to keep my camera safe.  this works<br />like a charm for what I want it for.  I also liked the price.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Great book, just a great read. I will recommend it to all my friends and family. This is a timeless classic!!
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|This game is sweet it has really nice graphics cool realistic suites of armor ,and nice sound...missions are ok like there a little hard sometimes like when u dodge missiles and planes but it's pretty fun . I give this games 3 out of 5 because it's a little hard but mostly Awesome!!!!
B0063M22QO|5.0|I enjoy playing a few games during my lunch break, relieves the tension. Easy to play and good for the mind.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This app is the bomb (which I shouldn't say with all that's going on right now in society so I won't so I didn't hahahahah)
B009NG1Q96|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. The plot is fun and the characters are well-developed. However, the flip-flopping is absolutely irritating. I wanted to throw my book several times out of frustration. It's worth reading and it is enjoyable, I just think America is NOT as bone-headed and silly as this book is making her seem. Hopefully the resolve she shows in the very end remains.
B005HSL626|3.0|Decent game but my daughter got bored with it fairly quickly. There's not much to it really, but like I said ifyou're looking for something to entertain children for short to medium car rides this will do just fine.
B000H4TX9I|3.0|I had heard rave reviews about this series. I was just not impressed with the story lines. I understand they were trying to setup characters but I feel they went too broad for a beginning. They should have went with a smaller crew and tied in more with the reavers and a stronger tie to the central government struggles. Overall it was entertaining but I found myself skipping ahead in some parts of the episodes.
B009K86D86|5.0|Know what you're getting yourself into when you watch this. It WILL change the way you view supermarket food and get you thinking about everything you put in your mouth and where it came from.
B002KYHZLQ|1.0|I love to read, even when it isn't the best book or it gets slow, I read on. Never skipping pages, never giving up, until this book. I only made it about 35% through, according to my kindle and it never got better. There are a multitude of characters that never caught my attention and a slow story line. It may have gotten better but I didn't stick sound to find out.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book. It was a fairly quick and easy read. It read like it is written more for a teen or young adult audience but I enjoyed it still. Some of the young character dialogue was a bit too adult and not believable for me. The subject of children with cancer may be tough for some to handle though.
B001N3GUIE|5.0|I have owned this movie in every format since VHS, Betamax and Laserdisc on up---it just needs to be in everyone's collection for all eternity. This was the catalyst for so many great sci fi films and TV series'....it's the greatest sci fi film ever made. If you havent seen it, buy it and do so, you seriously wont regret it :)
B00B9366VO|4.0|Lots of great artist interviews, good music.  Very interesting to hear about the history of this once great studio.<br />Starts to drag a bit at the end.
B0075MFS9Y|3.0|The Lumineers do a good job....I liked this, but did not love it.  Certain songs are great (Hey Ho, or is it Ho Hey?)  But not all are great.
0141197714|5.0|This was for my daughter and she accidently saw the book before giving it to her as a present. &#34;Mom I love these books is this for me?&#34; And I had to tell that happy face, YES! deb g.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|I like it. I like it. i like it. it is good for .... me and my friend usually played when we have good times.
0486295559|5.0|This is a very nice paper back or trade copy/larger than the average paper back. I was very pleased at the binding and will enjoy reading this for the very first time. Thanks for a classic and a very inexpensive price. Deb G.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Tons of cute mini games. Great for passing time. All kinds of games to choose from all in one app.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|Entirely too much sex to the point of being boring. No real story. The author could have woven in some more details about the characters or just anything.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|THIS BOOK COULDN'T BE MORE AMAZING OR PERFECT IN ANY WAY. I'M JEALOUS OF ANYONE WHO IS READING IT BECAUSE I WANT TO EXPERIENCE THE MAGIC ALL OVER AGAIN. I FEEL BAD FOR ANYONE YOU HASN'T READ IT BECAUSE THIS BOOK IS LITERALLY LIFE. PLEASE READ.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|For all ages!  Great scenes and great story.  This is a very entertaining film that cuts across age groups and cultures.
B005HEFB6M|4.0|It had to start somewhere, and this series tries to give the backstory to much of what is common in the Star Trek universe.  Many of the episodes deal with the trials and tribulations of being the first to go where no man has gone before, but after awhile the writers appeared to grow bored with all that and simply started making action episodes. One thread that was started but minimally revisited was the need for a Prime Directive.<br /><br />Frankly, the series requires much tolerance to put up with all the contradictions and unanswered questions, and the relationships between the characters created by the writers often don't reflect the interactions created between actors. Nevertheless, the crew is an interesting collection of characters with some very likeable actors.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This book gets 5 stars because of the emotions it conjured and historical value of making one aware of just how hopeless life can be for the downtrodden of society. Hopefully it teaches us a lesson for today. It can provoke anger about man's inhumanity to man and then warmth about the kindness and goodness of others who protect the weak. All in all a great read.
B004J4WNL2|4.0|As a licensed user of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator and a learning/reading fanatic, it is always fun to read a book where I might use this lens to absorb new content and perspectives. Looking back, this book reminds me of a championship athletic event, like football or basketball, in which the first half is forgettable and the second half is MOST unforgettable and impactful! Chapter 8 on Soft Power, chapter 9 on When You Should Act More Like an Extrovert, chapter 10 on communications, and chapter 11 On Cobblers and Generals are simply high-powered.  Professor Little's insights and behaviors are a very entertaining and his models are used by the author to resolve real-world conflicts being experienced between two couples that differ on the extroversion/introversion dimension. The models are so applicable to situations in everyday life that I need to review the chapters to capture them separately.<br /><br />I did want to add some items to Susan's list of things that classroom teachers/presenters/instructors can do to promote a learning environment that is fair and respectful to both the introverted and extroverted learner. 1. After asking a question, wait 5-7 seconds (my average wait time was 1.5 seconds for 15 years) before you will accept a response (no spontaneous responses allowed. One cannot think while another is talking, and the strong extroverts  who are enthusiastic will simply try to \\"talk their ways to answers\\". 2. When pair- or triad-sharing is done, initially group students according to their demonstrated verbal- energy patterns. (Let the extroverts learn to communicate with their verbose, interrupting, loud- and-simultaneously talking, and animated peers. Pain/frustration/inept performance can be the catalysts for improving behaviors.) 3. If you are an extroverted teacher, use a variety of voice volumes to communicate. 4. When an introvert has given inputs that are particularly relevant and interesting, you might ask the class if they \\"heard\\" the input. If not, you might consider asking the introvert to repeat the comments louder, so that everyone will be privy to this point of view, etc.<br /><br />I sincerely appreciate the author's research and fine work. She most certainly modeled quiet persistence in the process. This book has contributed significantly to my ongoing professional development! Thank you.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I rant about this book constantly because I love it so much. I won't say anything of the plot because I feel many people already have. But this book is full of hope and despair. It is written in 4 parts and they all eventually intertwine in the most wonderful and heartwrentching ways. The beginning was kind of boring to me, but it also gave much background knowledge that would be used later in the novel. It amazed me how delicate and beautiful a book could be.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|Great read, fast read, mind blown!!<br />I especially like the part about hockey players & tech pioneers.<br /><br />Give as a gift or read and share.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|This movie takes a hold of you and doesn't let you go.  It is a roller coaster ride of all human emotion.  Amazing cinematography and gritty performances.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Cool game, easy, lots to do. Graphics are nice and you don't have to buy as much in game as some other games
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Hoping that the HBO pacing will hurry up George R.R. Martin... without killing more Starks.  That is all, Amazon.  No mas.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I like most Pixar movies and this is one of them.  Great acting and wonderful graphics.  My wife and her friend don't like it as much as I do.  I like the story and get caught up in the drama each time.  The two extra small features are great too, especially the &#34;La Luna&#34;, really love that one.  I like the commentaries, but wish that commentaries would actually follow the feature film scene by scene instead getting caught up in rambling stories.  The commentators gave some really good insights to the backstory but they too got caught up in the going on too long while the film was unfolding.  Too bad that there were more extras with the package.
0525952926|5.0|Not read this book yet still reading the first book Fall of Giants, but sure it will make excellent reading.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|firefly set the standard for modern SciFi series.  Strong acting supports an outstanding story with tremendous characters. Better the second time through.
0451232852|5.0|I am presently reading this book which is another Ken Follett masterpiece gripping & historically informative & can highly recommend.
B0083DJWGO|5.0|I like him.  It's a book for people that hate BS and want to keep themselves in check. Nice work Taleb. Perhaps your next work should be about sports.
B00BGZ8TVA|5.0|this was an awesome movie. We enjoyed watching this movie. It was a spectacular movie. What more can I say!
B001QWBM62|2.0|Electronics failed after 3 years of medium use. Zoom Customer service is virtually non-existent, replacement for motherboard costs nearly the same as a new device.<br />Having said that, I enjoyed the device while it worked.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|This season was probably the best of all! I can't believe how it ended !<br />I can't wait for the next season because they set it up to be the<br />best ever!
B00BPWDMP2|4.0|I guess I was hoping for something new - while I love the harmonies of their sounds,  it all seems the same to me.  There is not a specific song that grabs me and compels me to listen and love it.  I'm sure I'll listen to it many times, I don't think it will be a favorite.
B000QJLQY4|5.0|== Summary ==<br /><br />This book represents the \\"10 Commandments\\" for innovators and entrepreneurs.

B0094M2NTG|5.0|I had seen it before, I thought it was real sweet, and I love Matthew McConaughey, that's why I watched it again
B004OC07F8|5.0|== Summary ==<br /><br />This book shows excellent study cases and details disruptive value innovation and business strategies.

B00CDT41RY|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie!!! This movie had me intrigued throughout the entire movie. There were parts that were a bit gruesome but I think it was almost necessary and added to the craziness of the movie. Would definitely recommend!
B003Y5H59C|5.0|This movie was a surprise the first time I saw it, it was mind blowing. after the initial surprise I satrt apreciating the art benneat it. very good movie, one of my favourites of this genera
B00BUVPIRS|5.0|Great graphics for a tablet, storyline can keep you busy for hours. Closely akin to Skyrim in a portable format
B006LSZECO|4.0|THE MAIN OBJECTION;  I REALLY LIKE READING ABOUT PEOPLE I COULD CARE ABOUT, BUT EVEN AFTER FINISHING THIS BOOK, I AM NOT SURE I DO.  BUT THIS WRITER CERTAINLLY CAME UP WITH SOMETHING DIFFERENT  HATE AND LOVE.
B004VFK5LO|4.0|Lots of suspense and a great &#34;scare&#34; movie.  Makes a person wonder how come so many serial killers are more prevalent than ever.
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|It was too religious for me (being an atheist). The scenes with animals being harmed disturbed my fiance. As a film, I would say, &#34;See it&#34;, to judge for your self. There are good parts to it but the religious theme was a turn off for me.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Love to play Mahjongg and this was a real challenging game, especially to beat the time. I still have a few I cannot accomplish but I will keep at it. Anyone who loves this type of game will get hooked on it. So mahjongg players jump in and get this !!!
B00BF11STU|5.0|Instead of a meat head's dream: blowing up cars, shooting a hundred bad guys and never hitting the &#34;good guy&#34; once, this tale will make you think. Think about torture (I know, I know that was the writer/director's invention), think about that made up invasion of Iraq, the root causes of 9/11 and the determination of the underdog to find that S.O.B. I waited a long while to watch this film. It was well worth the wait.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Great book, glad they're making a movie!  Easy to read, I couldn't put it down, read it in a day and a half.
0307346617|3.0|I really wanted to read a zombie book that started from the begining, like when the infection started spreading.  I does talk about that, but there is no story.  It is literally like a review of a zombie war from people all over the world.  As a zombie book, it's kind of boring to read.  I wasn't too impressed.  I have not read a Max Brooks book before, and with all the hype about him, plus this book is going to be a movie, I was excited.  I don't know...  Maybe I'm the type of person who that would rather see the horror than read about it, it's more vissually stimulating watching it, hearing the scremes and horror than reading that a person is running.  Maybe, it's just me.
B0095G5AFU|5.0|I got this to keep notes for meetings.I have now set up 3 books all for different items. I really like these. I will use these for so many thing.
B001B3MCQK|3.0|I got this album because I thought the movie \\"Searching for Sugarman\\" was really good. It was just an amazing story. But the music just didn't do it for me. During the movie I thought the music was quite good so I decided to pick up this album. There's there's a few good songs but the album by itself does not stand out. I listened to it about 4-5 times and that was enough for me.<br />I should have just gotten the sound track to the movie.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.. This author does a very good job of explaining medical terms... in layman's language and makes it easy to follow.. It's a moving book.. incredibly touching and believable.. I found this book profoundly moving and it just confirms what I already believed.. however if I didn't.. I certainly would after reading Dr. Alexander's account of his time in heaven.
B00BLGZN1S|5.0|Great movie with very little swearing which is surprising for today's films.  Lots of action and a great plot unfolds.
B004USRLRS|5.0|I miss those days. When true geniuses with real talent put out original music with something to say. So much great music has come from the mind and body of Graham nash and his mates. This album was speaking about the times in which it was released, but the messages are relevant today and the music is timeless. It is beautiful music, I don't kow what else to say. Good job on the remastering too.
B007VTUYWW|1.0|This movie is horrible. How could she get famous with this? I guess Mr and Ms Smith is in the same category
B00A17AD36|5.0|This is great.  If you never got a high off off music alone, try this.  Play this with your girl.  A new born baby is certain.
B009ANP4F4|4.0|When I'm busting a sick move in the club and wowwing the honies with m- aw, hell, who am I kidding? I can't dance for crap. I tried to do the Cabbage Patch one time and got a nose bleed. But I do love me the Step Up movies; they're some of my guilty pleasures. STEP UP REVOLUTION places fourth in the franchise, and while I wasn't sure I'd be into it, maybe because it forgoes the dance contest theme, it turns out, there's a different but equally absorbing competition taking place.<br /><br />The city of Miami is being rocked by a series of flash mobs performed by a mysterious dance crew styling itself \\"The Mob.\\" The news and social medias are quick to latch on to this phenomenon, and soon The Mob has gone viral and become the talk of the town.<br /><br />21-year-old Emily (Kathryn McCormick) arrives in Miami, determined to pursue her dream of becoming a professional dancer. Informed by a prestigious dance academy that her technique lacks passion, she's drawn to Sean (Ryan Guzman), a waiter and street dancer and co-founder of - yes, you guessed it - The Mob. Out comes The Mob's motivation: YouTube has launched a contest in which the first YouTube channel to receive ten million hits is awarded the prize of $100,000. At present, The Mob is in second place, behind some singing cat.<br /><br />But then the narrative introduces a bigger picture as a real estate magnate (Peter Gallagher) threatens to tear down Sean's historic waterfront neighborhood. Can The Mob's protest dances rally the beleaguered community and influence the land developer? Can they win the YouTube contest? Will the Winwood Dance Academy think better of Emily's technique and select her as a student? And where the hell can I get a clip of that singing cat?<br /><br />If you accept that this film stands by its STEP UP formula, that it limits itself to by-the-numbers storytelling, then you'll have massive fun watching this. Don't anticipate the two leads to be acting prodigies. Kathryn McCormick comes from a professional dancing background and had never acted before, and I think she's swell. Ryan Guzman was a model and had dabbled in acting, but had never danced before. The important thing to me is that what they do here seems to come from the heart. It's enough for me that they look good and have chemistry together and that their dancing is top notch. Ryan is phenomenal, given that he'd never danced before. But it wasn't until the scene when he was teaching his cute little niece the \\"Ocean, Motion\\" move that I decided I liked his character. It's a really sweet scene. Later, I tried doing the \\"Ocean, Motion,\\" and, yep, nose bleed.<br /><br />The choreographers try their dang best to impress you. The flash mob sequences are amazing, striking stuff, particularly the sequences at the art gallery, at the restaurant, and at the council meeting (my favorite). Keeping up with tradition, Stephen \\"tWitch\\" Boss provides the thru line, returning as \\"Jason.\\" And, of course, when the big finale requires extra dancers, Jason doesn't hesitate to reach out to his old crew from STEP UP 3D. So expect cameo appearances from a few STEP UP favorites. The flash mob finale at the shipyard throws everything at you. It incorporates several props and culminates in a moving duet between McCormick and Guzman. \\"With the power of dance I realize the value of this community,\\" confesses Peter Gallagher in an interview. Oops, was that just a spoiler?<br /><br />The DVD's bonus stuff:<br /><br />- Audio Commentary with director Scott Speer and actors Kathryn McCormick and Ryan Guzman<br />- Music Videos: \\"Goin' In\\" (Jennifer Lopez featuring Flo Rida) and \\"Hands in the Air\\" (Timbaland featuring Ne-Yo)<br />- 3 Deleted Scenes (totaling 00:03:32 minutes)<br />- \\"Becoming a Star\\" - exploring the chemistry between Ryan Guzman and Kathryn McCormick (00:05:05)<br />- \\"Choreography\\" - interviews with choreographers Jamal Sims, Travis Wall, and Christopher Scott (00:10:26)<br />- \\"Dancing On Their Own\\" - clipsof the cast & crew whiling away their down time by, what else, busting moves (00:05:01)<br />- \\"Making the Mob\\" - introducing the members of The Mob (00:09:52)<br />- Flash Mob Dance Scenes Index - option to view any of the film's six flash mob numbersof the cast & crew whiling away their down time by, what else, busting moves (00:05:01)<br />- \\"Making the Mob\\" - introducing the members of The Mob (00:09:52)<br />- Flash Mob Dance Scenes Index - option to view any of the film's six flash mob numbers
B007ZLKK9I|5.0|One of the best films I ever saw on the Beatles, and my sweet George. Truly inspirational even after the fourth time watching.
B002UM5BXW|4.0|Makes me proud to be an aspiring  chef and I can't  wait to make my way up the ranks I've been doing it for years and there's no stopping me
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|I was 45 minutes into this movie and I still did not understand the premise, mean while there where over 2 hours left of the movie. There was a cast line up, but I think the way they rolled the story out that they lost continuity thus loosing my perspective to get the point of the movie. I understood that there where key elements in the character's lives that somewhat hinged on each other, but in the end I did not understand the full picture till the very and and I am still not totally clear...
B003WUYRGI|3.0|I think the dictionary it great but it don't have the answer for everything I want to find out about. It is great though it is upgraded and very useful to others whom use it to find things that they don't know about.  My friends say it is great and it is very understandable.
B004Y1WCDE|5.0|Works really well, I would even say it streams better than a laptop when off my network.  I have used it on both tablets and my galaxy nexus and am very impressed.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I love this game it is perfect for morning entertainment!!! My favorite is my tryceratops!!!! she is pink and pretty
B00CW665VI|5.0|I thought I would read a couple of pages last night. I am now suffering with burning eye syndrome!!! Once I started could not put this book down. I laughed, I cried, I LOVED this wonderful book. I embrace my burning eyes. Thank you Emma Chase for putting pen to paper and rewarding us with a wonderful reading experience
B00CRWJ7VC|1.0|I have a pretty high tolerance for complexity but this film for me was just unwatchable. It was that rare movie I did not watch all the way through. Perhaps it all came together in the final 45 minutes but I will never know.
193700788X|5.0|This is the wife reviewing...this will contain no spoilers. Just wanted to share my thoughts on the \\"last book\\".It is a good read, as a continuation of the written series, not of True Blood. For so many books in the series it kind of wrapped things up nicely enough....I guess.  I think, for me, there is such a disparity between the books and the HBO True Blood. I am a long time fan of the books and watch the series because of that. I've made it through Season 4, so far....and there are still too many times to count of \\"what the heck?\\". I do not criticize Ms. Harris, for the \\"sale of Sookie\\", nor do I condemn her. What an incredible opportunity for her to have her novels made into an HBO series! Wow! The extent of literary license that was taken I am sure was not her doing, but my goodness. The gore, the filth, the pornography(yep, that graphic), the total obliteration of characters, or just major story line about-faces and changes, storylines going off  in unfathomable unknown directions and reasons(at times it was as if the True Blood writers were majorly on crack!), in my opinion, really, really, took so much away from such a well written book series....but as we know, when you sell your rights to your work, you no longer have any voice in it. So, having said this, I will continue to watch True Blood and the alternate universe it created from Ms. Harris's \\"Sookie and her world\\". I want to see where that Sookie \\"goes\\"....and I will most definitely continue to read whatever Ms. Harris's writes. I am still HER fan...so, if you want to see how True Blood ends...I really do not think you will find the answers in this book...I am of the mind that this book was written in it's original reality and continuity, when there is no HBO True Blood...and that is okay. As is True Blood being okay, being VERY loosely based on her books. Loosely being the keyword.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|I've played a lot of these matrix style grid games.  This is just another one.  The animation is good in the Ice Age theme.  The invite a friend and add neighbor feature is very problematic.
B004W1GCQO|4.0|It's a touching insight into the social side of Pre-WWII in England. Great stories intertwined like other fun period dramas. If you enjoy Downton Abbey and Selfridges, it's a great watch when you miss your English fix!
B00BHU2A7I|3.0|Interesting movie, but nothing to write home about.  This is one where I'm waiting for the book to come out, although I'm sure there's already an autobiography of Hitchcock.  I'll have to go check that out.
B00CWVG1Z8|1.0|Of course, the adage is that the book is always better than the movie. This very much proves true with Beautiful Creatures. I don't understand why the movie veered off course from the book in so many ways. Some things would have been easy to correct. For instance, the book put much emphasis on Lena's green eyes and black curly hair. And Ridley is described as being blonde with pink streaks in her hair. So why weren't either one portrayed that way in the movie? Colored contacts and hair products would easily have kept them true to their descriptions. It was also disappointing that Marian, a key character in the book, was completely omitted. Instead Amma's character was thrown into that role. And Amma's character was quite flat compared to her feisty description in the book. Finally, it is as if the screenwriters completely skipped over the end of the book and just wrote their own ending, which was nothing like the book. Very disappointing.
B000ICXQXI|5.0|I have read reviews that complain about the quality of the DVD and Blu-ray and I can't address that. I watched this on Instant Video and wasn't sure what to expect. It turned out to be in HD, the picture was clear and sound was great. Hitchcock was a genius. He could make great movies without all the gore and still get the gruesomeness of the crimes over to his audience. The music is where music should be and not playing over the characters talking. I watched with someone who had not seen it before and he thought there were two people.
B00CM6ZLG8|5.0|I absolutely love this album! Demi is awesome and she continues to grow as a person and artist. I just hope she continues to shine! The cd is full of many #1 hits. I hope she gets recognized and keeps on selling records!
B000VDUWMC|5.0|A new perspective in the paradigm of history, more appropriate for our days when all sciences make contributions to different fields of study. It brings about a new understand of our social and cultural evolution and gives a new understanding of historical facts other than just documents. Important to all young and old readers for a better understanding of our world and its historical facts.
B001LMU182|5.0|Neo-Tokyo 2019: Kaneda is the leader of a biker gang. His best friend, Tetsuo, gets injured during a fight with another biker gang, the Clowns. Kaneda and his gang get interrogated, while Tetsuo is medically examined. Colonel Shikishima and Doctor Onishi discover Tetsuo's incredibly dangerous psychic capabilities. Tetsuo, tired of being treated like child and always being saved by Kaneda, goes on a rampage across the city and Kaneda attempts to stop him from releasing Akira - the young psychic that destroyed Tokyo 31 years prior. Akira is a magnificent film from beginning to end; epic is an understatement for this captivating anime.<br /><br />The story in this film is fantastic. Yes, some aspects of the film are predictable, but it is still an insanely captivating story - I was hooked from beginning to end. The conflict within Tetsuo is particularly amazing to watch, especially as he changes; changes you can see his frustration from the beginning, and you can see how power-hungry he becomes when he realizes his power. The ending of the film is amazing and even thought-provoking to a point. If you're looking for action, this film is loaded with great action sequences, especially the second half of the film. The futuristic Tokyo setting is mesmerizing, and works well with the story. Although I prefer the Japanese, I found the English dub to be more than tolerable. The music is one of my favorite aspects of the film; it is so epic, so well-fitted and a soundtrack I can listen to without the movie.<br /><br />I own the Blu-ray of this film, which seems to be out-of-production now. It features both the Japanese and English audio, as well subtitles. The picture quality is superb, and the audio quality is great. (the visual style alone is beautiful.) If you can find a copy of this blu-ray, I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Overall, Akira is a superb anime; it is an action-packed, visually beautiful and epic film with a magnificent finale, while also being subtly thought-provoking. It is pure entertainment of the highest caliber. A must-own for fans of the genre, and fans of film in general.<br /><br />Akira has strong violence and gore, and some nudity.
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|Meh. There is something here... some sort of good story, it just didn't really come out. I think it was all portrayed a bit too slow, too poetically perhaps? Wonderful imagery and the time-travel elements are interesting. But at the end, I was just left a bit bored.
B00C3MKCIS|5.0|This is an amazing debut album from Sound of Contact. There is not a weak track on this CD. It has deep lyric, great melodies, and intricate instrumental sections/songs. Great mixture of melodic and progressive songs. Some of my favorite tracks are: Cosmic Distance Ladder, Not Coming Down, Beyond Illumination, Only Breathing Out, and Mobius Slip.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|The session is an admirable film a piece of poetry regarding intimacy. You need to watch it and enjoy how the filmmaker and the actors portray people's most basic needs to connect, express and feel through sexuality.
B00BC0JI6O|5.0|I really like this CD. I think it's one of their best, if not the best since Neal left.<br />I ilke every track on this album. I think that the new singer, Ted Leonard, fits in perfectly with them. Favorite songs: Afterthoughts, Submerged, and Something Very Strange.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|It's like a less frustrating, less cute Cut the Rope. Totally fun! I love the little noises they make. I don't have any problem with the ads, either. (does it really ruin the game for you to click an X every few levels? seriously, chill out.)
B000AJIF4E|4.0|I owned a similar set of headphones since 1982 and they were always great sounding (MDR-V600). They finally broke when one of the plastic hinges went bad. After 31 years I'd say that I hope getting 1/2 that time would be great. They certainly have the sonic quality you'd expect from this type of headphone (MDR7506).
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|Enjoyed this movie, he was a great man. I would definitely recommend  this movie to a friend or family member.
B009GX69RK|4.0|My wife and I started watching this for some reason a few months ago and we both really like it.  Likable characters, though Nick does seem to be a poor man's Charlie Day, not quite as insane but with the same girlfriend in the first season.  That said he's the best character on the show.  Anyway, good show.
B00AB7HESI|1.0|today:hey guys wassup I'm waiting for this app to download...taking a while.<br /><br />tommarow:omg I'm still waiting for this to download!<br /><br />5 years later: hey this is her sister she died over the 5 years waiting for this to download still waiting...
B00BTJMS1A|4.0|Once I got this game, I couldn't put it down. The mechanism is simple enough to get the hang of but takes a while but the increasing pace gives a decent learning curve. My only real complaint is that it's too short.... I reset my progress within a few hours of buying it as I'd completed it already.
B00AEBB9RS|4.0|This video showed like it was just filmed. It was a thriller that kept you guessing. Good quality acting and quality work. Great plot an ending.
B006YTTVHO|5.0|Very informative... It's a really good, easy book to read. I recommend it to anyone who doesn't always know what to say.
B00B2166BS|4.0|It's a power cord. It works as advertised. I'm glad I have it, as the USB charger doesn't keep up with the output of energy while you're using the Nexus 10.
B0064MGU98|5.0|being somebody living in chicago, loving this show. in particular, the part that the girs' parents are both in the prison. :)
B004XUMMFE|5.0|It is the best tv series of all time. I suggest you purchase Serenity, too. So that you can get some closure after you fall in love with the characters...
B00CS65JS2|2.0|Was expecting so much more after how hyped-up the album was. Definitely not what I was expecting. If you like all of Daft Punk's other albums, and that's what you're looking for, you're going to be disappointed.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|My 11 year old grandson introduced me to this game and I immediately fell in love with it. I am 75 years old and enjoy fun and games. Thanks to my grandson I have fun with the game every day.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Poker is realy boring and i thought that this game awesome but regardless it actually was worse than poker when you lose a bunch of people twin towers
0060254920|5.0|Never, never tire of this story.  It's an adventure each time its read.  Love the characters and all their actions.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Jodi Picoult has done it again for me. Her writing is such an emotional experience it is impossible not to get drawn in. Brilliant!
B002JWD6AS|4.0|*Contains information about the plot, but no major spoilers.*<br /><br />This book was pretty good! I really liked the plot idea in general, with the whole \\"temperature\\" thing that controlled the wolves' shifts, because that's something different in the paranormal genre - and I hate when books, especially romances, all follow the same formula.<br /><br />There were two major things I didn't really like that stopped me from giving \\"Shiver\\" five stars. . In the beginning, for example, we only get to see one or two examples of what Grace and Sam's relationship is like when Grace has no idea that werewolves exist and that Sam is human in the summertime. I would have loved a few more flashbacks, or maybe have a prologue with some of their first meetings. Also, I didn't like (spoiler alert) how Sam and Grace first kissed. Yes, they had known each other for years at that point - but only with Sam as a wolf. She kissed him the morning after she realized he was a werewolf! I mean, that was just a little too fast. Personally, I love the little awkward, beginning stages of romances in books, but in \\"Shiver\\", it was just... bypassed.<br /><br />However, this book did three things that make me like it: it made me cry, it made me smile highlight quotes and sentences I liked, and it made me feel anxious and want to know what happens. There were points where I felt my stomach clenching and my heart racing when something bad was happening - just because of a few paragraphs in the book! That's impressive, powerful writing, and one of the reasons why I enjoyed this book so much.<br /><br />I encourage you to read this book! It's not very long, but I enjoyed it - and if you're a fan of teen, paranormal romances, you will too!
B0063GORYU|5.0|Don't regret getting this app! I'm a solitaire and spider fanatic and this app is perfect. Thumbs all the way up!
B004IJY4L0|5.0|Just one long brilliant piece of work. I'm a fan of the entire release all songs and I think it's just overall amazing.<br /><br />All the songs have great energy and power and display growth in song writing from their previous releases.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I have never seen so many sounds in one app before. Plus the sound quality is great. You can mix any number of them, as well as adjust the volume for each one. I was just going through all of the different sounds and I was ready to go to bed. Very soothing. I would recommend to anyone of any age.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|terrific book.  Great reading,  it was hard to get into at first, then the story just grabbed me and I have to set the timer to know when to set the book aside.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Kind of hard to understand at times but very interesting. Want to read the book before seeing the play or the movie. About 10% into this now.
B005544V6A|5.0|Very engaging. Makes me want to become a lawyer. Intelligent writing many twists and turns. Each character is very three dimensional. I want more!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Great humor, intelligently pecking at NASA culture, but also nicely written hard-core SF describing a quite realistic and hopefully not so far future.
B00BCZU8WM|2.0|I saw Justin Timberlake on TV with his band, The Tennessee Kids.  He was on Jimmy Fallon for a week and performed new songs from this CD every night...and one night did a medley of older songs.  I was blown away.  Timberlake and his band were great!!!  He's one of the best pop/R&B singers out there today.  I bought the CD...and was very disappointed because most of the music sounds on the CD appears to have been done by...not musicians...but a guy with a computer and one guitar player....very boring.  I made myself listen to the first 5 or 6 songs...but gave up after that...and didn't listen to the rest...and I gave the CD away.  In my opinion, he should've used his awesome band (or some other great human musicians) on the CD.  I'd love to see him live....he's a great singer and his band is fantastic and I'm certain a show would be fantastic.  Too bad the CD doesn't measure up.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I like it.  Nice sounds, good choices and options.  Need it for pc now too actually. This is a keeper for sure.
B008OM0EDO|4.0|This movie is exactly what I expected from this kind of movie,  I enjoyed the dark humor, a very fun movie.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|I am so glad to have discovered this show, even though its a few years after the first season! The characters are great and the show (shockingly) focuses on ethical and moral behavior with the primary characters showing integrity. What a great change of pace from the typical primetime fare available today.
B00BHMF578|4.0|It was a real thriller, it had my heart going a couple of times during the movie.  The action shots were about action not blood and guts.

B0039TD826|5.0|It's my fourth copy of the album, so I knew it would be great!  Some obscure and classic Stones tunes!
B00AU15HPC|4.0|I love this CD, classic mellow Justin Hayward, easy on the ears and uplifting.  And then there is the ending song--the grand finale after a fine recording.  And what is it?  A gastly disco remix of the beautiful song \\"I Know You're Out There Somewhere\\".  What were the producers thinking and what was Justin thinking when he let that go through????  No matter, I burned the CD and just obliterated that atrocious aberration.
B001WCN23W|5.0|Some of the Stones good tunage!  Some good Mick Taylor slide guitar, and some Richards riffs throughout....  Not their best - like Exile.... but still not too shabby.
B009X01GJ2|5.0|I really love the quality of this product.  Not only does it look great but I love that I can revolve my Kindle Fire HD 8.9 back and forth easily between Portrait and Landscape.  Another perk is that you can charge the device while have the protective cover closed.  I had checked out many cases in local stores but could not find one I really liked.  I went on line and checked out what was available and chose this one.  Love it!
B000002HEM|5.0|My third copy of this album, and it's a must-have for 80s & 90s music lovers!  My fave version of Stockton Gala Days....
1451648537|5.0|Biographies are by definition bias, but you really get a sense of who Steve Jobs was.  RIP, Steve.  Your genius will live on.
B008B3H4VQ|5.0|Quality album, most present-day Linkin Park fans will love it. Unfortunately they still haven't captured the same quality of their first 2 albums but I've still given this at least a hundred listens. Some cheesy songs based around Chester's vocals, but a return to more frequent rapping sets this album apart from their last few.
B008QCBFPI|5.0|İt has a very impressive cover. I find myself starring at it :) It really has a paradise feeling.<br /><br />This is double-record.<br />I violently commend this album  to not only psb fans but to all music listeners.
B007O40PN2|5.0|If you love Bruckner and Mahler you will find the link between them in Rott.  Sadly he only wrote 1 symphony before mental illness took over. The recording is excellent in terms of playing,interpretation and sound.  Highly recommended!
0892818875|5.0|This is the best book I've read on aromatherapy.<br />Very comprehensive with background history and a<br />spot-on match to my own experience.

B008IJT0CE|5.0|I have used both the Free version and the Premium version of this app for over two years on my MacBook Pro and love them.  At the time I didn't have an android phone and my android tablet was only the 2.2 version with no Google Play (yes that's old but that was over two years ago).  I was very happy when Amazon brought the Free version and immediately installed it on my Samsung Galaxy phone.<br /><br />Yesterday, Amazon offered the Premium version as the free app of the day and I jumped on it.  App is now on my phone and tablet.  Happy to have it on the tablet as the tablet is used as my bedside internet radio, youtube, alarm clock, talk/music center and TV when I watch Netflix in bed.  So cool when going on vacation, overnighter or weekend trip I'll have the sounds on my phone.  It's great to make custom ambient sounds.  There's so many sounds you can make and you're able to save them within the app.
B0071XO8RA|2.0|I really tried to get into this but it was very hard.  Very slow and humdrum,  stopped reading after a while,  I may go back at some point but I don't think it will get anymore interesting.
B00AFROVQC|1.0|This book will bore the reader instantly with its weak and childish plot. The main character is instantly hated by the bad guys and loved by everyone else instantly. Besides the horrific plot, the author goes on with terrible grammar and dull vocabulary. The only reason I chose this book was because of the high prasie and ratings. This book is an overall waste or as the author would say &#34;waist&#34; of money!
1612680011|5.0|This book puts a fresh perspective on the world of business, employees, and anything else that has to do with the economy. (domestic or international) Rich Dad Poor Dad is one of the books that I would recommend to sell your bed and buy it. That's all there is to it! It's a simple book, but it doesn't mean that the concepts are simple to glace over. This book is packed with powerful information that will enrich anyone wanting to get out of the Rat Race. ;)
B000IDGBWU|5.0|A great dancing and musical movie.  I visited the move site in North Carolina and danced with my daughter in the same set as the final number.  My daughter was 14 at that time and really enjoyed seeing where some parts of the movie were filmed.  I would go back again to relive those days.
B00C8985DU|5.0|The reissue of \\"Wings Over America\\" is a welcome addition to Paul McCartney's discography. There are multiple editions available. In the U.S. there is a two disc edition which features the original 3 LP release on two CDs remastered at Abbey Road. There is also a special edition available at Best Buy that includes the third CD from this set with 8 tracks from the Cow Palace show in San Francisco and the deluxe boxed set.<br /><br />The remastering is very good. There is some mild compression (and peak limiting) that has been added to these remasters but they are still very dynamic and not brickwalled. Most of you reading this won't notice these minor issues and the sound is very, very good.<br /><br />The boxed set is spectacular. You get five books. One is in a handsome vinyl cover which includes the band's intinerary, photos of each venue that the band played, behind-the-scenes photos, lyrics for all the songs played during the show. This book also has replicas of invitations of original tickets for multiple shows and invitiations for after party shows, etc.<br /><br />Tucked inside a flap in the back cover of this book is a replica of the original tour program (the fifth book that might easily be overlooked). It's  an accurate reproduction (for the most part--I no longer have mine but I seem to recall it being a bit bigger than the one included here. Still, it's accurate as far as the contents as far as I can recall).<br /><br />Inside the books we get reproductions of the inner gatefold paintings, posters, etc. that fold out.<br /><br />Three 8x10 photos are also included in the package.<br /><br /> Housed in this book are the three CDs--the original 2 CDs (which represent the 3 LP release) plus a bonus disc with 8 tracks from the Cow Palace show in San Francisco.<br /><br /> There is also a DVD included which features the \\"Wings Over The World\\" TV show that aired on CBS.<br /> It's a 75 minute show. I do wish it had been made available in Blu-ray but for this set but we do have the [[ASIN:B00CG0YLGG Rockshow [Blu-ray]]] theatrical concert drawn from some of the same shows.<br /><br />There is also a book with photos from Linda (\\"Look\\") as well as a book of sketches done by Humphrey Ocean during the tour. The three books are all nicely put together (better than the \\"Ram\\" set).<br /><br />There is another book which has photos and comments from Laine, McCartney, etc. discussing the tour.<br /><br />All of these are housed in a sturdy case that is the same heighth (but not the same width) as the [[ASIN:B007L96VG0 RAM (Deluxe Book Edition)]] edition.<br /><br />Finally we get a card with the codes for lossless (or you can choose lossy) digital downloads of each track included in the deluxe edition in high resolution. There's also a card announcing the next two titles--\\"Venus and Mars\\" and \\"At the Speed of Sound\\".<br /><br />Should you spring for the deluxe edition? If all you want is the music then you could go for the Best Buy exclusive limited CD set. This limited edition includes the third CD of the eight tracks from the Cow Palace show. You could also pick up the \\"Rock Show\\" DVD or Blu-ray and get away for under $50.<br /><br />Personally, I'm glad I purchased this set as, unlike some deluxe editions that have some silly extras, the three books filled with photos, the replicas of the tickets, etc. made this an essential purchase for me but others might feel differently. This is a BIG set and it is filled with cool stuff. The only drawback as I mentioned is that I wish that \\"Wings Over The World\\" had been remastered for Blu-ray and that they had also included \\"Rockshow\\" but these are minor quibbles.<br /><br />Recommended.et but we do have the [[ASIN:B00CG0YLGG Rockshow [Blu-ray]]] theatrical concert drawn from some of the same shows.<br /><br />There is also a book with photos from Linda (\\"Look\\") as well as a book of sketches done by Humphrey Ocean during the tour.

B0024Y9EYS|5.0|This series was 1 of the best TV shows I have seen. Too bad it was only a partial season.
B003L77G6A|1.0|We are prudes. Sorry. The series has gone too far. I've had enough of the dirty humor and plots.<br /><br />What a pity. The acting is great and there are really hilarious moments. But those don't overcome the immense amount of bad taste.<br /><br />No more BB seasons for us.
B004QZ9PLU|3.0|Engaging but then it became predictable and overly romanticized.  Life is difficult and loving someone is a challenge.  There are not many happily ever afters.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I don't think I have ever written a review on Amazon, but after reading DEA I had to. The last two books weren't great, but were still entertaining. This book doesn't even manage that. I'm not one of those fans that feels like Sookie is a friend or that I somehow own the characters. It's an entertaining series and I always looked forward to the next book to see where CH goes with the characters next. So of course I looked forward to reading the last book. It was a complete disappointment. The whole book was a big contradiction to every other book in the series. It doesn't make sense at all. And it's not even interesting. If you're reading the reviews, you're going to read the book. I would borrow it if possible and not waste the money.
B001KWTBVQ|5.0|This is a wonderful movie, very good acting and best of all wonderful life lessons. Never judge a book by it's cover.
B0045HCJT4|5.0|Soldier is one of my husband's favorite movies. He loaned his DVD copy to a neighbor who &#34;lost&#34; it (or liked it enough himself to just say it was lost so he could keep it), so we NEEDED to buy another copy.
B003UBTX6S|1.0|POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD!<br /><br />I read Beautiful Creatures after seeing a preview for the movie and thought it was ok.  The writing style was immature, but that's not unexpected for most YA novels.  And there were a lot of cliches going on.  But I was intrigued by Lena and Ethan and especially by the family and I read the book very quickly over Christmas.  I never reviewed it mostly because I was ambivalent about it.<br /><br />Then I bought Beautiful Darkness.  Ugh.<br /><br />First off, the story was very poorly imagined.  The idea of the magical tunnels/underground isn't a bad one, but it was very badly executed.  I could never follow exactly where they were going or what they were doing down there.  The magical system made no sense.  As another reviewers noted, the authors kept changing the rules at their whim (I shudder to see where they would keep going with this, but I can't bring myself to read another page).  And don't even get me started on the ridiculous ending!<br /><br />But there's something that bugged me that I have not seen anyone else mention.  Perhaps no one else even noticed it, but it was positively glaring to me!<br /><br />Now, the story begins not that long after Beautiful Creatures leaves off, but then it basically fast forwards to the end of school and the beginning of summer break.  Lena has pulled away from Ethan and he goes to the library with work with Marian, and this is where he meets Liz, a terrible annoying, poorly written Mary Sue (even more so than Lena, who is beyond cliche in terms of angst but who at least has a personality).  Because Lena has essentially abandoned him, Ethan supposedly begins to develop feelings for Liz even as they're chasing after Lena, so that at the end of the book when Ethan finally \\"gets Lena back\\" he admits that part of him loves Liz, too.<br /><br />What's so bad about that?  If you go back and look at the book, the authors label the events of the story by date as time progresses.  Looking at the dates, it was, I believe six days between when Ethan met Liz for the first time and when he declared that part of him loved her (it could have been, say, 5 or 7 days, but I have the Kindle edition so it's too difficult to go back and check the dates).  Really?  At 17 you love one girl and managed to get to know another enough in 6 days that you love her too?<br /><br />Ugh, ugh ugh.  This story is so revolting.  The characters, if they were ever believable at all, went straight off the deep end in this novel.  The poor writing, as I mentioned before, was offset by a somewhat interesting plot in the first book.  Without a good plot, there is absolutely nothing to recommend about this book.
B008ZOHCKE|3.0|I have been looking to a list program for my Kindle and thought this might be it. There are no instructions and no &#34;Help&#34; menu, so it took a coupke of days to be able to create a list. To do that, I have had to create a new page for each item...not ideal, so I will keep looking.
B000EWBKM6|1.0|If you order the entire series do not need to order this movie. It is included in the series set
B007KZY1YY|5.0|Read the first book, and enjoyed it, so thought I would purchase this one. I'm enjoying this book more than the first one, I can't put in down! Looking forward to the next book.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Well I officially have a new book boyfriend and his name is Drew Evans!! I read a lot of romance/erotica<br /> books and I have to tell you this one is one of my favorites.Drew is incredible..funny as hell ,sweet as sugar,and sinfully hot.I was torn between reading till my eyes bled,cause I couldn't get enough,and taking my time,cause I didn't want it to end!!! Emma Chase did a fantastic job with these characters..Drew and Kate are perfect together...can't wait to get another fix..I'm ADDICTED!
B005CRQ2IU|4.0|This is almost just like the movie minor changes  the costumes are all most just like the movie a little hard to follow but it's great if you like V for Vendetta it is the same thing with super heroes the story is about someone killing off the last of the super heroes in a world were heroes are not allowed unless hired by the government the last heroes and together to kill the murderer<br />Cons: to many characters all the characters are super heroes mostly and then you have the before watchmen series hard to follow<br /><br />Pros: Great book I love it Allan Morre is great I thought it was epic great way to tie all the characters together my personal favorite character was Rorschach but each character has such personality I am a marvel guy but I loved this book
0060245867|5.0|This book, and the entire series, is a great buy, a terrific value. Fun little books you can read to your age-appropriate child as a little reward, as a bonding experience, and to encourage him or her to want to lear to read themselves....or help them learn to read when they are capable of trying to handle the book's reading level.<br /><br />The books are beautiful in hardback, and an incredible value in paperback.  Just no negative aspects.  Buy this and other books in this series wihout hesitation.<br /><br />Paul<br />Texas
B003O86FMW|5.0|Love it .. Loved the characters and can't wait for the next movie after reading this and last book in series
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This is a fun clean and entertaining game for children of all age groups to enjoy playing as they create and build their own reef I would recommend this game to anyone
B006Y5H74W|5.0|So sad the network cancelled SMASH!  Now I can watch it whenever I want. LOVE this show!  Fade in on a girl.....
B00821PCJS|5.0|Love the characters. You really become engaged and want to experience the highs and lows of basic survival with the characters. Very Very entertaining.
B005HEFB6M|5.0|Minimal experience in space, growing up fast, shedding their embryonic stage while dealing with detractors from the Vulcans -mother hen approach- while at the same time all but denying humans need to aim for the stars.
B008OM0EDO|1.0|Cheesy and not funny at all. Don't waste your time or money. This is probably Sacha Baron Cohen's worst film to date.
B00CL50LEC|3.0|For a teen movie, it kept my interest long enough to get to the end. Not fabulous enough to watch it twice...
B000PY6BBI|4.0|I'm not too critical when it comes to movies  so I thought it was pretty good for its time. I have seen some really bad movies in this genre and this wasn't one of them,  but I've seen better.  If  you just want to see something  new ( if you've never seen this)  to kill some time it  will work. Don't be expecting a masterpiece or you'll be disappointed.  Seeing some famous actors in their much younger years was interesting in itself.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|this game is pretty good overall. I wish it was easier to get the bigger prizes in the mini game. I also wish there were more mini games to choose from.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|I started reading this series from a free trial and fell in love with it.  Once I started reading it I could not put it down.  When I finished it I got the rest of the series.  Now I cant wait till the next book.<br /><br />J
0857685627|4.0|I expected a little more. Though not a halo fan, I do love the artwork from it. It did pack allot into this one book though. So since I don't plan on buying ever halo art book this works really well.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|I am really into the Gabriel Allon series by Daniel Silva.  After reading them all I was looking for another read in the same genre.  This was a good story and I would consider reading more from this author.
B005LAII80|5.0|different take on Judge Dreed from the older 90's version. It did a good job in my book, I hope they make a sequel.
B00CRWJ7VC|5.0|This movie is a little confusing at first.  I was waiting for a while to understand how it all connected together since the description and preview lead me to believe it would. Just stick with it. It has a good message and really picks up after a bit.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Though I have not watched it yet. I love the film in the theater, and I just had to have it for home.
B009MYARIK|4.0|Sophie Kinsella always writes and entertaining book. It's light, fluffy, and fun reading. It's perfect for a summer day on the beach!
B005F96UNM|5.0|I saw the movie on nextflix, and was oh slap this is awesome. It did what kill bill did in one movie, and with way more style. And the price on it is a steel. It's a shame it's a sleeper movie. Went completely under the radar.
B004QX07G4|2.0|Ellen's comedy doesn't translate well in print. It is her delivery in person that works best. Her expressions and mannerisms really sell her comedy. The printed page is lacking.
B002UXRGM0|1.0|my review is clear and simple, it doesn't play on ps3s.<br />the information in the description of this product didn't mention anything about the 40 fps it was filmed on not working on a region free device such as the ps3
B00CWVGBEO|3.0|It had action, but he did a lot better job in &#34; The Expendables&#34;.  I thought his performance was sort of dry!!!  Maybe you will think differently.  But it was ok.
B008133MDK|4.0|This series is a younger and faster moving Holmes, more like a Sherlock/Watson buddy series.  There are still plenty of intellectual puzzles being solved and more focus on Sherlock's fast paced thought processes - but much of his dark side (from the novels) not shown.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone - and especially younger audiences who may not be familiar with Sherlock Homes stories.  The fast paced dialog and storylines are done creatively and are never dull!
B00CDFWJIG|4.0|I like witchy movies anyway, but this has a twist ending.  You really think you know how it end, but then you could be wrong.  I'd take a peek just incase you might think the same as I do.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Book Club read. I enjoyed reading this because the characters turn out to have many layers to their personalities. The twists and turns are unexpected, the planned out detail for any future outcome is clever.
B00CL50LEC|3.0|It had some charm, but it wasn't funny, funny, ha,ha, kids would probably like it.  I got because my grandsons wanted to see it.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|It has a problem if you want to hear it while you are reading you cann[t please give us a version to listen while you read
0345525558|5.0|I had trouble putting this down. Engrossing. I know this book is making the rounds of the book clubs. I think the disfunctional characters will create a lot of discussion.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I LOVE this game! But,  when I try to open it on my kindle fire it closes automatically no apparent reason. Any help?
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|What a great game,Game loft has done it again!!!!  The action is non stop, the graphics are kicking butt!  @ dev keep the entertainment coming! Thanks a lot :)
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|I really liked it and would recommend it to others.  I only gave it four stars because some of the scenes were too far-fetched.  Great action, story, and Tom did an excellent job...  Some parts were very amusing and I found myself laughing out loud.
B001NHNG64|4.0|After seeing the movie for One Shot, I thought I'd give the series a try. Just like the first book, I could not put this one down. I'm already on to the 3rd book and loving it as well. So if the rest are as good as the first 3 books, this will be a great series.<br /><br />Only complaint is that the author being from England does use some terminology that I have to question what is meant, like referring to a shotgun as a &#34;12 bore&#34; instead of &#34;12 gage&#34;. But he's the author and I'm not from England, so that may be the proper term across the pond!!<br /><br />Just wish I had more free time to sit down and read them all right away.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Okay . . . so, here's the thing:<br /><br />Do you want characters you can believe in and like?<br /><br />Do you want a touching story that can make you laugh and cry?<br /><br />Do you want INCREDIBLE dialogue?<br /><br />Do you want a romance that is so wonderful and wonderfully sad all at once?<br /><br />Do you want a to read a book by a stellar author?<br /><br />Do you want all of that without ANY fantastical or magical elements? Yeah . . . well, I don't usually go for books that don't have this last one, but I am sooo happy I picked up The Fault in Our Stars.<br /><br />This book was very highly recommended by one of my editors. I have a lot of respect for her book choices so I decided to give it a try even though it is out of my normal fantasy choices. This book does not disappoint. I absolutely LOVE Augustus and Hazel's way of conversing, and there was a really refreshing and unique voice that John Green used in telling this bittersweet story.<br /><br />I finished up this book as I sat at my first con as a published author, quietly hunkered down behind my author table to read during every second I could steal (and, Mr. Green, I most likely could have sold more books if I had been concentrating on what I was there to do instead of reading your most excellent book. Just sayin'). An author across from me told me she couldn't believe I could read it in public without crying, how wonderful she thought it was, and, as a high school English teacher, how she wished she could teach this one. I had MANY young ladies stop and gush to me about how amazing the book was (yep, Mr. Green, I took full advantage of those moments to try to sell my own book to those young ladies).<br /><br />So, do I recommend this book? Without hesitation. Just be sure to have a box of tissue handy and, if you're old enough, a bottle of wine. I happen to be more than old enough.<br /><br />Go . . . buy it . . . read it . . . and, enjoy.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Just plain funny. Not a whole lot of depth, but you're not looking for that if you watch this. Seriously, one of the funniest movies I've seen in a while (for guys and girls).
B004MC8CA2|1.0|I have attempted to load this app on my Kindle numerous times. When I contacted them to figure out why I was having so much trouble they said that they were having trouble getting their revised app approved by Amazon and Apple. Can't tell you how many hours of frustration this has caused me!
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|Everyone I know thinks this is the best movie ever. I don't necessarily agree with it, but I do really really like this movie. It's a kids movie that adults can enjoy too. Will definitely buy once my kids get older.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I like the app features, but it seemed to be querying my phone so much that it slowed down my other apps.  It caused my phone to hang, so I uninstalled it.  Problem solved.  It didn't seem to be querying the network for updated content, but rather querying my phone and passing that information on somewhere.  Can't prove this of course, but it was very suspicious.  Will not reinstall.
B0094K1PW4|4.0|Good entertainment for lazy afternoon. Some what predictable, but light comedy moments. More of a family movie than action movie.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I was sceptical at first, how could this app help me relax and sleep better? To my amazement I hv been sleeping much better and taking time to relax each and every day. This app is a positive life changer. I enjoy the many different creations of beautiful sounds it lets me create, fitting whatever my mood is for each day. This app is worth every penny. I read a lot of reviews about looping issues with this app. I hv a kindle fire and experience no sound skipping or sound probs at all. I highly recommend this app and truly wish I'd acquired it long ago. Enjoy!!
B009GEFXLC|5.0|I was initially afraid to watch this show as I am a huge Firefly fan, and I was afraid to see Filion in another role. But I have to say, he is a joy to watch as Richard Castle. Enjoyable, pleasant, and captivating, Castle is one of the best shows out there.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a fun and active game I love all of the games like subway surfers New York yall should make a new one soon because this is 'really a great and fun game I love it thank and make more.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway suffers it is woo fun and the places change so about right wen it gets boring it changes places and it is just woo. Kid frendly
B009NY43NY|4.0|My only complaint is that this is the last one!<br />An absolutely delicious read ... the literary equivalent of having dessert ...
B0083GQ2A0|4.0|Delivered as promised. Nice movie that will keep you watching, sometimes little yuck , we all wanted to change the ending
B00C7NKPPS|3.0|Nice to have \\"Wings Over America\\" back in print again but I can't say that the remastering improves on the quality of the recording much. What puzzles me about this release is the quality of the packaging. It's nowhere near the quality of the previous McCartney remasters. The cover is quite flimsy and thin, there are no reproductions of the inner sleeves to put the cd's in, there's no reproduction of the original album poster and the booklet is very thin with just four photos, Two color and two black & white and the track lists for each cd  and no liner notes or any comments from Paul or anyone. It's like they didn't put any thought into the overall packaging. The previous remasters have very well constructed digipaks on good quality stock. I picked up the Best Buy exclusive which has a third cd featuring 8 unreleased live tracks from the Cow Palace circa 1976. This is the same bonus cd that's included in the mega expensive set that none of us can afford so the Best Buy set is a good way to get the Cow Palace tracks. I hope future remasters go back to the high quality of the initial sets.
0679805273|5.0|Nice pictures and book is for young and old. Delivered in very good condition. Makes a great gift. I got mine as a give away graduation present since kid had played in 'seussical' play in his senior year.
B005RJ6AIK|4.0|My wife finds this music very relaxing.  I think it is an excellent collection of artists and songs.  I would buy it again.
B002PMPTIO|5.0|I was really impressed with the movie. Very well done. I liked being able to watch it on my computer. I just wish there was a way to download it so I don't have to log onto Amazon everytime I want to watch it.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Like all the Birds games, this is fun and challenging.  Sometimes very challenging.  I like this as well as the original.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved Bared To You so I decided to read Reflected In You. All I can say is WOW. So many emotions. Such an erotic book with a side of drama and mystery. I highly recommend this book to the right crowd ;) Finished both books in 3 days and I barely ever read!! Very very good follow up from Bared To You. Enjoy!!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Good graphics, I can set a voice indicator when my battery runs below a certain % which is very handy when I am deep into a book and forget to watch my battery level. I purchased the app (developers need to eat too) and I am very happy with it.
B007ZRZF8I|5.0|Best platforms &amp; action game ever<br />Please do your self a BIG favor &amp; Buy This Game<br />&amp; subscribe to Chilled chaos!
B003DBOS7Y|5.0|I never wanted to see this movie due to the fact that I hate romance movies and anything that will make me cry. My friend had been telling me for years I watch it and I always refused. Well she came and actually forced me to sit through it. Can I say how happy I am that she did. This is now my new favorite movie. I watched it 3 times with in 2 days. And cried each and every time. This is by far the best love story ever created. I will be buying it as soon as I find it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Pretty darned awesome. I like the fact that the scenery changes with every update. I'm surprised...well actually I'm not, that temple run 2 basically copied their daily challenges. Losers.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I am no movie critic but I do love Tolkien and this was a must watch for me.  I really liked the movie, yes it did move away from the book in places but this is a movie, not the book and standing on its own merits I found it to be a good and enjoyable movie.  I can't wait for the other two parts to be released.  The movie arrived on time and was safely packed.  I had no problems with the order or the shipping.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It's a great read for all ages. Sucks you in and you just want to keep reading! Definitely one of my favorites!
B002XXNSF6|4.0|Simple storyline but a very interesting treatment. Looking forward to seeing the sequels and to see how this story ends.
B00CATSONE|4.0|A great man whose greatness was over shadowed by the greed of his detractors.  And enemies were hiding every where.
B00C4YZ12C|4.0|Reminds me a lot of Galaga. I really enjoy this classic game. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a galaga type game.

B0013O123Q|4.0|This is compelling film with some stunning performances.  But, be warned, there is some VERY graphic violence including an horrific rape.  You should also know that the film is told in reverse, starting well into the aftermath of the rape and working its way backwards.

B0046B3QTG|5.0|Steve Carell's performance as &#34;Gru&#34; is spectacular and the rest of the cast is equally good.  We are clearly in the middle of an animation golden age.

B00COGZ8FU|5.0|The plot has twists and keeps you interested throughout.  I enjoyed Tom Cruise's performance.  I hope they make a second one.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|It is really fun and challenging. There are many different levels to play that are very exciting to play and figure out.
B00COHAUD4|2.0|I can't stand it when the villain is a CGI character.  It turns the movie into a cartoon for me.  Spoiler alert:  the ending was terrible.

B00BSBT8M6|2.0|Didn't really care for this movie.  It was slow and didn't really make that powerful of a statement as it obviously was trying to do.
B009LMTDL0|3.0|By giving us a glimpse into her life in the fast lane, she has articulated many obstcales that women face in the workplace.  I want the conversation to begin as there are more obstcales in women's lives that need to be addressed.  I am thankful that she took the time to address at least some of them.
B005DWBO0K|5.0|An incredible film, in some ways better than the many versions that followed. Interestingly in the unrestored version, Bram Stoker's character names are used. e.g., Von Helsing, Minna. In the restored versions, the names are changed. Apparently, this was due to copyright issues. The restored print is so much improved from the original and it includes an excellent score. Max Schreck is unforgettable as Nosferatu. The expressionist direction by Murnau is a perfect complement.
B00466HM28|5.0|I've been making beats off and on for about five years now, so I finally decided to buy my a midi controller now that I'm getting serious. For a college kid, this is perfect. It's cheap, portable, and accurate. I was able to plug it right into ableton and made a few beats that day no problem.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|I thought the premise of this movie was intriguing, but the movie never actually delivers on its synopsis.<br /><br />Maybe some minor spoilers below...<br /><br />So, we are supposed to get that these are people reincarnating through time and interacting with each other through these various lives and story lines.  Okay, sure, whatever.  None of the stories really tie together, and there really isn't any sort of coherent theme between them.  A soul's growth throughout the different incarnations or their choices reverberating through time?  Didn't really see it.  The personalities between the differing roles just don't even seem remotely similar in order for the viewer to think 'Aha, so I see how that character was affected by his previous life!  Eureka!\\"  There are some minor tie-ins between some of the stories but nothing that really struck me as profound.<br /><br />The stories themselves aren't even interesting enough to make this movie watchable.
B00C4YZ12C|4.0|Pros: Pretty art/graphics, smooth gameplay, easy to pick up and play in short sessions, fun!<br /><br />Cons: The &#34;settings&#34; button is a long bar at the bottom of the screen which interferes with gameplay if you are not paying attention. Wish there was some way to hide or disable it because it doesn't even bring up settings.<br /><br />My Phone: HTC One - Sprint
B005LAII62|3.0|ParaNorman is a nice story. To me it was a story about tolerance and understanding. The movie moved rather slow for me. I guess I expected a few more laughs too.
B004026L2U|5.0|She loves them. They aren't bulky, super cute and feminine.<br />Easy slip on and off, great for around the house, yard or quick trip to market.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This gripped me from page one. Very enjoyable read. I highly recommend this book. I felt transported in time and place.
B002GYI9C4|5.0|I have read a lot of Brandon Sandersons book, but this serie is the one i like best. I am one of the readers that was surpriced by almost all the plottwists Sanderson gives out, and i just loved it.<br />He does a really good job of tying all the loose ends in this last book. He also draws some nice paralells to the earlier tree books. I do not think it is good to read this book without having read the earlier two books, as this is a very good ending to a triology. I really like the endings, i think they are well thought out and make sence for the different people in the story. I also love that we will (maybe) be able to see some of the people in these books again, and without comming with any spoilers, i can wait to hear more about the really cool magic systemst/powers Sanderson has invented in this facinating world.<br />Recomended very much!!
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I highly recommend this book for a great summer read. An unlikely pilgrimage indeed, but a journey into the soul of a man most would never expect anything remarkable from, a simple, lonely, unheard man. From his early  years, Harold tries to fade into the background, to go unnoticed. As he matures, he chooses a career that is safe and doesn't require him to excel. His relationship with Queenie is a mystery  until later in the book.  His relationship with his wife, his son and people in general are all disappointments in his life. His journey reveals a side of him, people he meets and his family even he could never expect.

B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|I almost gave up hope and thought I was doomed to be overweight for the remainder of my life.  However, this is my answer.  I've been on this plan since the 4th of April and have lost 12 lbs.  It is not the fastest diet I've ever been on but it is the way I want to eat - forever.  In just the same way that weight crept on my body, weight is now going down.  It is great to zip up jeans without the pulling and straining.  This plan is addressing the chemical imbalance that emotional eating does to the body.  I find that I am looking forward to the &#34;fast&#34; days.  I get full faster (amazing).  I am craving healthy food on my eat normal days.  It is the answer I have been searching for.  Reading the site for the latest information on the studies is fascinating.  I hope this answers the problem of obesity for America.

B0036OODFU|4.0|Great movie- one of my faves, but I think the Bootleg Extended Cut is better than the original release and unfortunately you can't download the Bootleg version online. That's why it only gets 4 stars and not 5.
034580404X|5.0|Great read and a great deal of the set. I am glad I bought all three cause I did not have to wait to read the next one, was just able to start it right away. A good deal for the trilogy and would recommend buying the set if you start reading the first one.
B005HEQ4XQ|5.0|My husband is a Die Hard Star Trek fan and I really like them too. Especially liked the Next Generation series.
0812993845|1.0|Sorry I bought this book.  Story line is so ridiculous.  For a professional author this book is poorly conceived and executed, even for a chick lit summer read.  Save your money and don't waste your time.
B009NY43NY|4.0|When hearing about the final book and some very nasty comment that were written on her website baffles me, how people can call an author that they read, these horrible words because the ending doesn't suit them. Give your feedback people, but why be so harsh. Charlaine Harris wrote a great series I appreciate her talent and only wish I can write like her. Some books I loved more then others, but if I started reading a series and didn't like her last few books, you probably won't like the last one obviously you no longer find the series of interest, so stop reading them. Thank you Charlaine Harris for a great series, and thank you for the great characters you have created. You have entertained me over the years.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|A little flat, but some moving moments. some special effects were tired looking like the cut-rate version of the &#34;Lord of the Rings&#34; trilogy.
1604680547|5.0|I love this book!  I do a lot of applique work in my quilt art and there are many motifs in this book which would work great for<br />that purpose.  I bought this book to use for applique and hand quilting.  Not disappointed at all.  A value add to my quilting<br />libray.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|Earnest but a little tedious. Good acting from some characters, Mr. & Mrs. Lincoln, but not so good dialogue at times. The complex story was difficult to pull off. It got a little pedantic. Some moving scenes of the Civil War coupled with slow moving scenes depicting the interactions between Cabinet members and the President.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|This book was a wonderful followup to Beautiful creatures.. I cannot wait to see how the story continues! Read on!
B000GOWNPU|5.0|It was overall a great movie. It included so many different elements such as friendship, injustice,  and revenge and somehow it delivered a very powerful message.
0142423432|5.0|This is a larger paperback with color illustrations. The page numbers still match up to the regular paperback copy.<br />It is a beautiful book.
B000FVE3BG|5.0|This is a great watch because it looks good, runs great and best of all, it is a lefty watch!!
B009AMANH4|5.0|My husband was a pain in the you-know-what about seeing this movie. Every day &#34;We have to see Lincoln.&#34; &#34;What are we doing tomorrow, we should go see Lincoln.&#34; &#34;I will not let this movie pass without seeing it.&#34;<br /><br />Needless to say, we saw it and loved it. The only down side is that now that we own it, I get to hear &#34;Let's watch Lincoln&#34; at least once a week.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I absolutely love this game.  There are plenty of levels and difficulty increases.  Makes you use your brain. I love the Color version as well!
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I really enjoyed this novel because it took an interesting perspective. I was entangled in this boy's trials and triumphs. It also included many high school issues that students are facing everyday.
B00BXHE0CI|5.0|Doesn't matter what you think of the earlier stuff. This is really, really good DEP. (Adding words to hit the count of 20.)
B003R50FRI|5.0|Very very good book.True story and amazing what this guy did with his life.One of those books that keeps you reading right through-and it is a BIG book.
B00BQ1D7X4|3.0|I bought black gives way to blue and loved the album. I expected an evolution off that record that would never come. When I listen to a collection of music from beginning to end I expect that collection of work to flow together to form a great overall vibe and sound to the complete collection. Instead on this release I heard a few solid tracks and the rest just didn't grab me at all. I think they really missed the mark as this album could have opened up the door for what William had to offer the band. At this time I will pass on this release and I will give it few more listens.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|...okay... I guess... it's not bad... its not amazing either. Katniss didnt have the spunk she used to. Peeta was okay. Gale gave up. Prim toughened up. Happy ending. Just... good
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|One of the best games out there and it takes a lot to impression me. Atari style game with better graphics.
B00847KFDS|5.0|This album combines new renditions of the classic rock songs John has written for Creedence Clearwater Revival and his solo career. PLUS there are 2 new songs!! I officially have a new favorite Fogerty song, MYSTIC HIGHWAY!! This songs has so many different elements to it and it truly is a classic.<br /><br />Songs to check out!<br />-Almost Saturday Night: the perfect song to get ready for your Saturday Night!! and it is with Keith Urban! LOVE HIS VOICE AND BANJO PLAYING<br />-Lodi: with John's sons, Shane and Tyler! The beginning of this song is extremely catchy! I always find myself coming back to it!<br />-Mystic Highway: One of the new solo songs on the album. This song has so many different elements to it. IT'S 6 MINUTES LONG!! Halfway through the song, it completely changes and I thought it was a different song, but in the end it returns to the incredible chorus! \\"Mystic Highway that I'm on!!\\"<br />-Wrote a Song for Everyone: with Miranda Lambert! She brings a new light to this title track. Her voice is so beautiful and not just a traditional \\"country voice\\".<br />-Someday Never Comes: with Dawes! The lead singer of Dawes, Taylor and John's voices blend so perfectly! The harmonizes on this song truly make it a stand out!<br /><br />Plus Rolling Stone gave the album a 5 STAR REVIEW!!!<br /><br />Check out this new album!! You will not be disappointed!!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This is a great spin on all those endless runners. One flaw: touch controls in the armor shop are way too sensitive. Accidentally wasted 7,000 Stark Credits. Maybe an &quot;Are you sure you want to purchase this armor?&quot; function would fix that. Otherwise I love this game.
0312263120|5.0|Another classic Dan Brown book that you won't want to put down. A great read. I hope they keep coming.

B000YPUFA6|5.0|Outstanding!! Great Seller!! Highly Recommended!! Thank You!!!
B004J4WNL2|3.0|I'm a businessperson (who happens to have 4 kids) who bought this book in the hope of learning more about primarlily the workplace dynamics of the introverts/extroverts spectrum and other related topics.<br /><br />The book starts out well in my opinion and touches on areas that I felt were useful to my daily business dealings, using both anecdotes and general research. Later in the book, however, it seemed to me that the book moved to a more anecodotally-focused, parenting/child-rearing discussion about how to raise introverts with even such details as how to schedule play dates so as not to overwhelm an introvert child's daily schedule and school work. Perhaps other readers will appreciate and value this advice more than I did.<br /><br />At times the book veered more heavily into the science of the mind than my practical perspective appreciated.<br /><br />Nonetheless I believe the book has some redeeming qualities and justifies a 3-star rating. You may just want to skim faster through the play-date advice sections if they don't apply to your personal situation.
B002ZG98UK|5.0|Outstanding!! Great Seller!! Highly Recommended!! Thank You!!!
B002UWH8P6|3.0|Too much Drama. There is no team spirit. In the fight for survival they fight and plot against each other.

B00A2YAY3C|5.0|This movie was an excellent film. Operation Market Garden was well portrayed. This movie may have been filmed many years ago, but the story it tells is one that every generation should come to know.
B00B7IJBUY|5.0|Because we can is one of the funnest songs to come out in a while. Great guitar by Richie. Amen is a beautiful song and the most erotic song I have ever heard. ---David Stynchcombe
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|this game is awesome. I love super diesel 4x4 and semi truck. tank is cool to. get this game. it is awesome!!!!!!
B0044C5SCU|5.0|For me the odd sci fi occurrences and graphic dissections of victims  are not what make this show interesting.  It is the interactions of the main characters who develop a connection as they evolve into a team working closely together.  Over time they begin to show a real caring and protective attitude toward one another.  As usual it is the people that drive a good story.  Though it took me a couple episodes to get into it I highly recommend this series.
0307341550|4.0|This novel was riveting and thrilling.  It had me guessing the entire time.  I'm not much for thrillers, but this had an unpredictable ending.  I had read her other novel: \\"Dark Places,\\" and did not expect very much from this novel, as I had not liked Dark Places, but this was a different story.  The storyline and the characters were extremely complex, and their many layers and true colors were revealed throughout the story.<br /><br />Camille Preaker, the main character of the novel, was a journalist working for a second rate newspaper in Chicago.  She had just recently been admitted to a psych hospital, and as she returns to her job, her boss assigns her a piece centering on the murders of two young girls from her tiny hometown, Wind Gap, where everyone knows everyone's business.  She is hesitant to return and rekindle her old relationships with her family: her estranged mother, quiet stepfather and mysterious sister, Amma.  As she begins to work on the case, she begins to identify with the young victims, forcing her to face her past.  As the story and case unfolds, Camille's own story unfolds as well, drawing parallels from her own childhood to that of the young victims.<br /><br />This story is not just a page turner, but it analyzes the deeper complexities of human nature, and the evils that can be created from other people's actions.  The evils portrayed in the novel were chilling, yet Camille's redemption for the horrors that were created from her family was both heartwarming yet admirable.  This is a definite must read!
B000JMKQX0|4.0|It's about how we respond when we're faced with hopelessness. And, it's presented in a fresh, interesting way using creative survival scenarios that make you say, &#34;Oh yeah, that would be a problem.&#34;
0307341577|1.0|I have never actually disliked a novel.  I always try and find something positive about the novel, whether it be the author's writing style or the plot was imaginative.  Even if neither were the case, perhaps a character in the novel would be worth noting.  However, this was not the case.<br /><br />THIS NOVEL WAS HORRIBLE AND IT ALMOST MADE ME NEVER WANT TO READ ANOTHER ONE OF HER NOVELS.  Libby, the main character, had no layers at all.  For someone who watched her entire family get slaughtered in front of her, to be left with only a brother who she was not even sure had killed her family, she had no thought nor opinion of anything.  Her entire life was defined by this event, yet she didn't even bother to want to know the truth.  She was okay with letting people run her life, letting people tell her what to do.  She let her brother go to jail for a crime she was unsure he had committed.  When approached by the Kill Club, she was only interested in the money and not her family's case.  She was selfish, and I did not appreciate nor understand her actions at all.<br /><br />At first, I gave the book a lot of leeway.  I made excuses for Libby.  \\"Oh she was young, she wasn't able to get the truth.\\"  \\"Oh, she's not selfish, she's just hurt.\\"  But, it made me more angry when she refused the Kill Club's help.  I did not understand her, and her emotionless attitude.  There was no real character growth worth noting about this novel either.  The ending was horrible.  It was not predictable, but absolutely stupid.  Yes, it could realistically happen, .but honestly, why would someone want to write an entire novel, with that ending.  It just seemed pointless and I was extremely disappointed.<br /><br />Nonetheless, you can say, that I hated this novel and definitely wasted my time.  Pick up a different novel by this author.  \\"This was not her best work,\\" is an understatement.
B00466HM28|5.0|A great Synth for a beginner or professional laptop music creator. Very compact and efficient. The keys are not weighted, but have a nice spring to them. I highly recommend.
B00ACBN9CI|5.0|This is a REALLY good game and it took me 2 days to reach level ten and I think you guys should update it so there are futuristic aircrafts soooooo they would have awesome stuff on them and the highest level futuristic aircraft should have 1 nuclear missile so If u shoot it into a pack of jets it will destroy all of them in the radar but u would have to turn on something so u don't get destroyed.
1451695195|5.0|This book is an account of a neurosurgeon's near death experience. Dr. Eben Alexander, the author, survived a severe illness and this story tells his experience during the severity of his illness whilst he was unconscious, in a coma, in an intensive care unit. I declare that I am a nurse and I have experienced an out of body experience during a meditation session, albeit many years ago, and it has never happened since.<br /><br />This story was well written because it held my interest. I could not put it down, therefore it warranted 5 stars. However in his attempt to analyse or make sense of his experience from a scientific point of view, at times this book became a little too technical for me. Whether or not you believe that Dr. Alexander did reach heaven, is for the reader to judge and in my opinion irrelevant. This is an account of one man's experience during a severe illness, which almost ended in mortality, and this man for his reasons has felt a compulsion to tell his story.
B00821PCJS|5.0|I really enjoyed this show, it has a pretty cool point of view!  I would recommend it to anyone who likes Sci-Fi!
B008BU75IQ|5.0|The, hopefully, continuing saga of the Clifton clan was another well crafted story telling effort. Archer weaves a compelling tale with a new generation of characters and continues to hold our interest in this extended family. This was supposed to be the last volume, however, he was again leaves us with a cliffhanger! I'm looking forward to the next volume. There has to be one!

1452110581|4.0|Adorable.  While I can see how these are (I think) meant to be funny, I found them to be more poignant than anything else.  I may be reading way too much into these little snippets, but some of them (like \\"Why Are You Screaming\\") almost left me teary-eyed.  A must for any cat--or poetry--aficionado.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I think that this is the most fun and enjoyment you can have on a game and not have to spend money
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This book was hard to put down!  It really captured the attachment problems the main character suffered from based on the problems with her birth family and the foster care families she had to endure.  When she finally had people who truly cared for her and wanted to help her, she didn't have any idea of how to respond in a healthy way.  Great story writing and fantastic research on attachment disorders!
B005PK57IK|5.0|Fix your streaming problems, Amazon. Your customers with Prime know you are aware of the problems. Suggest you call Netflix and inquire about how their streaming is 10 TIMES BETTER THAN YOURS!!!
B0077EBWVI|4.0|I had refused to go to this movie. After all, why remake a perfectly good movie. I was impressed that this remake was worth the time to watch. It was different enough to distinguish it from the original. However, a lot of the lines were the same so it was very familiar. Dueling tractors are no more... it has adapted. The dancing is also updated. Ren (Kenny) is amazing! He has a different approach than Kevin Bacon had with the role and did a fantastic job. I have started looking for his movies so I can see more. I couldn't believe they found a talented actor/dancer to play Willard who looks so much like Chris Penn. Some people have trashed his performance. He did an excellent job in such an iconic role. I was also impressed with Julieanne Hough. She's a good dancer, but I didn't know what her acting was like. She did a good job as Ariel.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|I've been a HUGE Rod Stewart fan since Maggie  first hit the airwaves and have long awaited some more good music<br />From this recording Icon!  This album didn't let me down, although I had to listen to it a couple of times before i fell in love yet once again with the amazing Rod Stewart!! I feel a lot of these tracks where his &#34;swan songs&#34; , he wrote very<br />Nostalgic and touching  tracks, like &#34;Can't stop me now&#34;, I love the Maggie May reference , and &#34; live the life&#34;,  I feel was his way of handling out some great pearls of wisdom!! The track &#34;Time&#34; and &#34;Picture in a frame&#34; are quite honest<br />and show great sensitivity. If indeed these are his &#34;swan songs&#34; they show what an in creditable  artist Rod Stewart is<br />and will always be. Fans will love this album, like all his others, he just a lot more reflective like we all get when we are over 50!!! (Or at least me, for sure).  Old fans like me, you'll love it!!!
B003Y74AZ2|3.0|Fits loosely which makes it less convenient taking it in and out of pockets but stays on ok. And offers protection from being dropped from most angles
B001NLL93W|5.0|Love this series. I don't compare it to the others I read because it is in a class all by itself.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|I wasn't a big fan of Julianne Hough until now, she did a fantastic job in this movie.  I've never read the book, but I thought the plot was great, plenty of suspense, romance, comedy, and drama.  I would recommend this to anyone!

1843106698|4.0|It has much information about the asperger syndrome. For instances it was orginally discover by a eurpean doctor hans asperger. In the mid 1940's. And wasn't notices until about 1981 in the US. It tells about general how many people have this syndrome. They intelligents. How young the syndrome is noticed in children. How it can be ignored or as somethings not. Why school counselors or physicology do not have the proper training or understand of it. Lists cannot be tolded  in few short lines. Is book can give a good deal of help!
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Loved the story as well as the acting. Great cast. Highly recommend if you're looking for a very well-done drama.
B00CATSONE|2.0|No real information on Tesla. A waste of time. Itr seemed that the author had another agenda rather than writing about Tesla.

B00C4YZ12C|5.0|I've had this game for a few days and I enjoy it.  It brings back the old school feeling of space invaders and other games like it.  The controls are simple and it will pass the time.

B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|I haven't read the book so I wasn't shackled with the same angst that a lot of the other reviewers had about this not measuring up. It was entertaining enough, not a great thing I'm going to remember for the rest of my life - but I am going to go get the book now :) It gets three stars instead of four because you could tell they rushed several things. Timing was off.
B000000OE7|5.0|Great Queen music...  What else would you expect.  Freddie's final masterpiece is extremely Freddie - Great!  Listening to it over & over agsin.
B00CVSMLXS|2.0|First of all, the show has fantastic production values and generally excellent writing, direction, and acting. The exception is the heavy-handed liberal politics which are spouted by Sherlock Holmes. It totally runs against his classic character who, as a rule, doesn't give a rat's behind about politics and political maneuvering. This is because he only cares about what is, not what should be. Politics is--by its very nature--the practice of super-imposing what we each think SHOULD BE on the world. Sherlock doesn't care about that. He's concerned only with crimes and solving them. He's not soft, or cuddly, and he wouldn't be caught dead adhering to the politics of any specific political party. Here he adheres strongly to the leftist politics of modern liberal America.<br /><br />It'd be one thing if a more minor character were used as the mouthpiece of liberal propoganda, but it is just downright offensive to have Sherlock spout the lines when he's the last character in the whole show who would have the propensity to do so.<br /><br />And it'd be one thing if the episodes featuring the spouting of blatant liberal propoganda were few and far between, but it occurs on a episodic basis. After several episodes my wife and I could no longer tolerate the blatant use of the show to espouse liberal views and stopped watching entirely. This \\"American Sherlock\\" is NOT Sherlock. It's just a co-opting of the characters' names and mystery premise for just another American procedural.<br /><br />Seriously though. American media is often left-leaning in lots of subtle ways, but this show is over-the-top obvious about it. If you're conservative you'll hate it for making Sherlock spout ridiculous ideas that run counter to his character; and if you're liberal you should be outraged that they've twisted Sherlock into merely a political puppet who solves crimes part-time.<br /><br />Loose the politics, Elementary, and I'll start watching again.

B000THGR0Q|5.0|This album has really stood the test of time. It has never gone out of print, and to be honest, when I first heard the music of Clannad, and then the Riverdance craze which put the whole of Keltia on the map once again....I kept thinking back to this album ....which in many ways put the REAL England on the map, and caused folks to dig ever deeper into the pantheon of the Druids. The spirit of olde tymes is indeed captured here.<br />Do your homework, many of the themes do touch base with the crisis of our modern world, and we need to focus once again upon the wealth of knowlege that Nature bequeathes....NOW. \\"Songs From The Wood is a statement, and musical excellence with no parrallels....for the other Prog giants had digressed to a pretensious level by this year (1977)...so it was also a breath of fresh air(e). Have FUN with this too, for you will feel like dancing....NOT the disco, a strathspey :)
B00CDT41RY|1.0|I was hesitant to see this movie until I heard Jamie Fox talk about it. I was expecting a wonderful triumphant love story with some shooting...but there was way to much vulgar language and gory violence. I had to look away multiple times and fast forward a lot. This movie is way overrated, probably due to the star cast in the credits. They needed big names to sell this crap!

B00B4VXQC8|3.0|First reaction was OK, they made this for the troops, veterans, unemployed and disillusioned. Great idea! I for one could use a little cheering by my favorite band! Then my eyes glazed over and I clicked to the next song and the next, etc. If I'm right about their intentions, they kind of missed the mark. Even so, I'm anxious for their next release and was really happy to see this one drop at #1. (Just so you know where I'm coming from, These Days and Keep The Faith are my faves, and Lost Highway is a party in a box.)

You will enjoy the story of a courageous boy who strives to become a member of the legion and who has a mysterious power and of course there's the addition of love thrown in throughout the series that just makes it much more interesting to read! You should stop reading this review and go read the book!

1742200508|5.0|I've had good experience with Lonely Planet travel guides in the past, and this one still managed to exceed my expectations. I'm not an expert on England, and although I've been there several times I've yet to visit the vast majority of regions covered in this guide. Using this guide, I'd feel comfortable not only finding out where to stay, what to do or where to eat, but I'd also feel quite good about using it to plan an overall trip.<br /><br />Many guides cover different regions of countries and cover the various categories for each of them. But this guide offers a very good top down approach that gives a good feel for the country itself, major attractions across the country, the different regions and what they offer, and it does a good job conveying the atmosphere of each region as a starting point.<br /><br />From there, you could use it to decide which recommended itineraries would make sense depending on your tastes and preferred activities, or you could use to to investigate regions, areas, specific attractions, or restaurants and lodging in locations you already plan to visit.<br /><br />This guide is different in some respects from other LP guides in that rather than using authors whose extensive visits of many months allowed them to investigate regions in detail, these authors have spent a lifetime traveling their own country, yet still know how to present it to an outsider. Granted, there's no phrasebook in this one, so if you visit the West Country areas you'll be on your own when it comes to unfamiliar vocabulary. Rather than these more typical features, you get almost 850 pages of material, including full color maps and plenty of pictures. Although I haven't seen the first six editions, this seventh one builds upon a dozen years of previous ones and makes it all current. This review is of the March 2013 7th edition.<br /><br />Despite its strengths, it could have done better telling you when to see things on a more granular level. Rather than merely telling you what seasons are best for what areas, it could have gone into detail about how long you'd end up waiting to get into certain landmarks in peak season or how far in advance you'd need to try to get tickets to enter Buckingham Palace. You might have the patience to wait in line for an extra hour because you planned your trip to the Tower of London during the peak time of day, but finding out that tickets to another attraction are available for three days ahead at the earliest is better if you have at least four days left.elling you what seasons are best for what areas, it could have gone into detail about how long you'd end up waiting to get into certain landmarks in peak season or how far in advance you'd need to try to get tickets to enter Buckingham Palace.

0812993845|4.0|Do you ever make unfortunate choices?  Sophie Kinsella's latest heroine, Lottie,  has made plenty. So many that her sister calls them just that - unfortunate choices. Lottie has made a really whopper of an unfortunate choice this time and her sister, Felicity, tries to rescue her which leads to some very funny scenes in the book.<br /><br />Lottie has recently broken up with her boyfriend, Richard, and is so upset that when an old boyfriend from fifteen years ago turns up she is over the moon with happiness to see a romantic man from her past. Lottie's long lost love, Ben, instantly steps in to fill Richard's shoes and Lottie soon makes a decision that will change her life. And not in a good way!  Lottie, Ben, Ben's best friend and Felicity all converge on the Greek island of Ikonos to stop Ben and Lottie from, well, making an unfortunate choice!<br /><br />Along the way Felicity meets somebody, while trying to solve her sister's unfortunate choice, so love is definitely in the air in this funny and lighthearted book.  I was laughing aloud while reading this one and though at times it was a bit unbelievable, I really enjoyed it.  I think this is another strong entry in Sophie Kinsella's repertoire and I recommend it!

B00AREIAI8|5.0|Pretty cool game to play I have always wanted a horse and this game fills that fantasy til I can have one
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I read all the previous novels in this series and with the end of each one hoped that the sequel would come out soon. This book is no different that all the rest in that respect. A lot of loose ends from previous books are taken care of here with some very interesting new information about Pendergast's wife, Helen. I raced through the book in a day (well I had to work, too) and wished I had read more slowly and savored it instead of gobbling it up.<br /><br />I'd recommend this to anyone who is looking for a more intelligent protagonist, a story that will draw you in until you can't stop reading, and an ending you won't be able to predict after reading the first three chapters. Start with the first book, though - this is not a book you can jump into mid-series . Grab some snacks to keep close at hand, then good reading!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|The saga continues and only grows richer with each new twist.  I loved the first two books and this one has only added fuel to my appreciation.
B0041D843M|5.0|The information gathered for this book is nothing short of phenomenal. Understanding the connection  and relationship between the diet you eat and the health you may have or not have is critical and the earlier one learns and commits to a plant based diet can be a \\"game changer\\".
B008JFUP0I|5.0|This movie is more than fast paced action and stunts. There is a lot of emotionally charged and exhilarating raw energy in almost every frame of this film. It is almost addictive in its approach. This film draws its energy from the story line and the well-defined multi layered and familiar characters. There is motivation and every action has a reaction and this film is riding that super highway. I thought Vin Diesel, Paul Walker and Dwayne Johnson were fantastic. They are integral to what works in this film and they just keep getting better. This film is very good and it went far beyond my expectations that were high in the first place. FAST & FURIOUS 6 went beyond the beyond!
B003F29D44|5.0|\\"Create instead of buying and selling what others do.\\"<br /><br />\\"When a man is staring into the abyss he finds his own character, and this prevents him from plunging into the abyss.\\"<br /><br />Great lines that took the movie to a deep philosophical level. In the end, a man might lose everything and it will all be fine, as long as he doesn't lose himself. Bud found his character in the end and fought to make things right. He paid the due price, and yes, he proved it to himself that there is justice in the world. A crook got another crook; but only one of them walked away with a clean slate and an honest smirk on the face. I only regret not watching this movie when I was younger.

B00CRW2066|4.0|The longtime National fan in me enjoys this album because it's ear & mind candy: great to listen to and intellectually engaging. But the music fan in me is disappointed because it doesn't really break new ground, which I was afraid of after High Violet's success. Then again, this is fairly common with bands that have a breakout album both critically and in popularity.<br /><br />Furthermore, I don't understand all the commentary/gushing about how the album shows the &#34;maturity&#34; of the band. They've been at it for over a decade, the members are in their 40s, and the National has always been more &#34;mature&#34; than their peers. Maturity is not an adequate measuring stick for these guys.

B008RJFRTK|4.0|This is a great app that offers you a Thomas Guide type map as detailed as you need.  The only downside I have found so far is that there are some glitches in it.  For example on a recent trip to Los Angeles the map was unable to find LAX by that title and it was hard to find Los Angeles International Airport since the name is evolving.  LAX is LAX around the world and on all airline sites.

B001AUEMFS|5.0|Viva La Vida stops me in my tracks at the first note. Great story of the first time I heard this Coldplay song. I was sound asleep in our friends sixteenth floor penthouse beachside in Puerto Vallarta Mexico. We had gone to sleep around 1:00 am lulled by the ocean waves and a lively wedding down on the beach. At 4 am I was awakened by this melody and flew out of bed and out onto the balcony and called to my husband to come listen. This song was stuck in my soul and I had no idea the name or who did it and felt I would never hear it again. Then a month later driving my son's car with the digital readout on the radio Viva La Vida came on and I knew at the first note, so I know knew the name and artist and I have it with me all the time. Never has a song/melody held me so spellbound.

B009NG1Q96|1.0|How to begin this?  I enjoyed The Selection enough to read book #2, but was skeptical because of the things I did not like about it, namely the complete lack of world-building.  I was kind of hoping Cass had learned from her first rodeo, but I am sad to say that was not the case.<br /><br />In The Elite, we find America as one of six final girls in the selection and her heart is torn between Prince Maxon and Aspen, her ex-boyfriend who works as a guard in the castle.  She goes back and forth, back and forth, never able to full commit to either one, mostly because she is unsure about becoming a princess and the political ramifications that could have.  She discovers some hidden truths about her country's history which color her decisions.<br /><br />In the first book, I liked America.  She was normal, a girl with opinions, someone not afraid to stand up for what was right.  In The Elite, I found her to be wishy-washy and confusing.  She allows herself to be swayed with a kiss or a promise, but then changes her mind in a split second based on circumstantial evidence without asking for clarification.  She doubts herself and her ability to lead, which drove me up the wall.  She does not trust anyone, despite telling herself she will.  If I'm going to be totally honest, she became very shallow and weak.  So many dystopian and fantasy novels are making waves because of strong, kick-ass heroines.  America Singer is not one of them.  She could have been, but her lack of self-awareness just killed any hope of that.<br /><br />On the plus side for characters, both Maxon and Aspen were stronger love interests this time around.  I did not care for some of Maxon's actions, he is still too feminine and child-like IMO, and I was convinced America was going to walk in on Aspen making out with one of her maids, but overall, they were better.<br /><br />And then there's the world-building.  By saying it's pitiful, I'm being generous.  I feel like Cass came up with a great concept - this new country with a caste system and rebels who wish to tear it down - but the execution was frankly lazy.  There is no depth to it and I found myself rolling my eyes more than once.  The rebels that attack the castle multiple times could have been great plot points, but we're given virtually no details about the attack and why they're after the monarchy.  Cass tries a little harder by offering us the diary of the man who started the caste system, but again, the lack of depth is frightening.  The diary read like that of a thirteen year old girl.  I appreciated that in the end, when offered an opportunity to make a difference in her country, America takes a big leap of faith, but I also saw it coming a mile away.  It occurred to me while reading that this world of Illea would have been much more successful if it was not dystopian, if Cass hadn't started out with the US as the backbone for it, but if she'd just made it fantasy and started the world from scratch.<br /><br />I think my biggest complaint is this - this is not a smart book.  The characters are not intelligent, they make silly decisions and are generally shallow all around, and the writing leaves much to be desired.  Occasionally there was a line I thought was good, above average, but ten or twelve good lines in a 300 page book does not a winner make.  I maintain that I think the concept is great and I'd wager in outline form, it looks brilliant, but in reality, so much didn't work for me.  The gorgeous cover - whoever is designing this series is a genius - is the best thing going for it.<br /><br />1.5/5<br /><br />P.S. - the character names are still terrible - like an episode of Teen Mom on steroids.

B00B8PMWJI|1.0|Spoiler!<br />I first saw the trailer for this movie and thought it looked decent! I loved V/H/S and tails from the crypt but this is complete junk! Granted everyone has their own opinion and this is mine!  Worst movie ever! Let's give u the general idea of what your getting into! You will see men that are forced to masterbate to different live scenes such as a legless woman humping her fake leg to a man molesting a boy! It doesn't actually show the molestation but you know where it's leading and when it's going on. The man who ejaculates first wins and the loser dies!<br />Another letter consists of a woman with a giant penis attached to her using it to fight another woman that is shooting fruits out of her vagina!<br />A girl wanting to die by sucking the farts out of her female teacher!<br />A woman using a plunger to plunge her newly born baby into the toilet!<br />Another is a woman who is attacked by her own turd!<br />If this wets you apatite then have at it cause there is plenty more!

B00BHU9DUK|3.0|ALERT!  MY REVIEW IS FOR SOMEONE WHO ALREADY READ THE BOOK OR KNOWS THE STORY.  Acting is good.  I love the visual experience of this movie.  Same director who did \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" but Personally I hate this story.  Wife cheats on husband.  Loses son whom she loves.  Then dies in the end.  Tragic.  I don't think its the greatest love story.  The greatest love story would have a wife and husband who love each other and never cheat.

B003G4W49C|4.0|Surprised how good this book was. I heard some good things about it and now after reading it, I can't wait to read more. It's strange how a boy can influence the world, and Orson Scott does a marvelous job with his writing. Very well done.
B000002UWL|5.0|I never knew much about the Pet Shop Boys.  I remember &#34;West End Girls&#34; and have listened to many extended dance versions of same over the years but never cared for anything else I heard by the P.S.B's.  About two months I found a group of toon's on my online music account apparently tailored to my taste.  I listened to all of them and only liked one, that was titled &#34;My October Symphony&#34; by the Pet Shop Boy's.  It stirred something in me and it took about three weeks to figure out just why I liked it so.  The P.S.B's. are British and it is hard to understand much of what is said in their song's.  One refrain was easy, &#34;When Revolution turns to Revelation&#34;.  I really feel this and of course it was just a short while before I realized this was about the Russian Revolution of October 1917.  I have since listened to it so many times that I know the rest of the words.  It then was removed from my music account and no one could tell me why, so I was left to find it.  It took some time as I couldn't find it at Amazon at first but came accross a u-tube video of the number, Russian Revolution and all.  I then found the album at Amazon and it turns out I like the whole CD.  I'm happy, Bruce M.
B00C4YZ12C|3.0|Ok, the game is a good FAOTD , but there is no level select option. Just a play button. And every time you exit the game, it starts over at level one. Which obviously sucks. If you are gonna pay for a game similar to this. Voxell invaders is the best!
B007MU85D0|5.0|This is an amazing album that involves a beautifully coordinated duet with awesome instrumentals. I would highly recommend this to any music listener if you're actually looking for some substance in your music.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I found it to be a great way to be able to escape. The story was entertaining while giving me an opportunity to open my minds eye & view the characters in my own way. I am looking forward to reading the next book in the series.
B00BMKDTNC|2.0|If you've read the entire series, then read this book. If you've never read any of the WoT series, then don't start because the ending doesn't justify the time invested. The book feels \\"forced\\". I'm a huge fan of Sanderson, but it honestly reads like he just wanted to get the story over. I always wondered how all the loose ends could be gathered together and pulled tight and I'm left wondering it now. So many unanswered questions and letdowns. Rand could have fought the last battle as he did several books ago!

B008B68IEA|5.0|Exactly as described. My daughter is a huge M.H. Fan and would have me buy every single doll if possible as well as every single accessory...Unfortunately we aren't rich by any means!!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I read all three books and loved every one of them.  It begins as an erotic adventure and turns into a love affair.  Great books to put you in a different world.
B00AA8Q0FQ|5.0|Exactly as described. My daughter is a huge M.H. Fan and would have me buy every single M.H. item if possible...
B006ICOK00|5.0|I like these cameras so much that I ordered another one.  Based on the TLC 200, I also ordered the TCL200 F1.2 (2) and the TLC Pro.  I am using four Brinno's at work for profit and two at home for personal fun.<br /><br />I sincerely love them all.  As a professional videographer, I was prepared to be quite critical, as I have used \\"trail cams\\" in the past which really didn't provide the video quality I was looking for. But, I haven't found any real problems. The video quality is perfect for the task.  I've also tested the GoPro, which is a fine video camera, but better for real-time video than time-lapse, as the battery life is very short.<br /><br />The Brinno has an exceptional battery life.  I leave them up for weeks and weeks without changing batteries. They are easy to use and do exactly what they are advertised to do.  Sure, you can buy a time-lapse rig for $4,500.00 that offers more features, but it's also very, very expensive.<br /><br />The Brinno cameras are perfectly suited for their task and offer various types of lenses in different models, with removeable lenses in the pro model.  I have read other's comments and I have not experienced any of the issues they cite.<br /><br />Overall, I love these cameras.  And, I'm making money with most of mine : -)  The others are for me to play with!<br /><br />FYI - I do not work for, nor am I compensated by Brinno.  I'm just a happy customer.

B0057567P0|1.0|Sonnet needs to list this in giant letters &#34;DOES NOT WORK WITH THE TEMPO 3/4 ADAPTER!&#34;  Had to return it.
B00005JKDR|5.0|Arrived as promised on the exact time, date, and in the exact condition as promised too. A perfect gift movie to keep for all time.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Graphics and function are good.  Levels offer variations in difficulty factor.  It can be addictive..  It is my favorite choice when I am sitting at the Dr.'s office waiting ... makes the time go faster with a fast paced game. enjoy!
B0095P29EG|5.0|Awesome movie in my opinion! Also the streaming HD is also very good! I recommend this movie to any action/ fiction movie lovers!
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|I bought this BluRay specifically for a few children, ages 3 through 8, to watch and they have wanted to see it repeatedly since I purchased it. To me, that makes this a five star movie. It is very engaging, cute for kids with references an adult enjoys. My two twenty-something sons like the video gaming nods they make. Add to that an all star cast of recognizable voices and an upbeat ending and you can't go wrong unless you don't like upbeat endings.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|Enjoyed every minute! I was inspired by her perseverance in the face of so many obstacles. There is a lesson in this book for every one.
B00CFQN12Q|3.0|It was okay, but what lacked in plot they tried to make up with action.  Didn't work too well.  But I still love Bruce Willis.
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|I didn't expect to like Smash when it first hit the TV season last year, but i found that the talent of the actors and the quality of the music and the fun plots really hooked me in.  i was so sorry to hear it was cancelled after the second season.  i think it gave many of us a new focus on live musical theater and a look at some amazingly talented and dedicated people.  it's great to be able to re-watch the episodes on Amazon.  Love this PRIME advantage!
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Good book.  Really enjoyed the pace and excitement.  Have already begun &#34;To Die For&#34;  Highly recommend it to all of my freinds
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Highly recommended book. An exciting journey, can't wait to read book 2. Blood song definitely does not disappoint. Good read.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I've had the Logitech G930 for a little close to 4 months now and the initial setup was brilliantly simple and worked<br />\\"out of the box\\" so to speak.<br /><br />Wireless capability is quite attractive on this device and maintained itself well through almost 3 walls over 10 meters with some of my testing. Thankfully it does provide an obvious noise when the signal is lost which is a slight beep and subsequent loss of slight static noise, when it picks the signal back up it's another quick beep.<br /><br />The G-macro keys are something that needs to be on any wireless headset now, it's a beautiful thing to not worry about wires when getting up from your seat but to also continue talking is an awesome experience for the first time.<br /><br />Possibly the first time I will ever give a product a 5-star rating as I believe there is always room for improvement in anything, but unfortunately amazon won't allow a 4.5 which I gave on a person review over at:<br /><br />http://www.vexwars.com/logitech-g930-review/<br /><br />For the price on this headset, you really can't go wrong and with companies beginning to adopt social networking a lot more now, support has become alot easier with getting your voice heard should you have any issues at all!
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I loved figuring out what the chapter titles meant because they weren't ordinary descriptive titles. They were clever and had a deeper meaning. Also, if I hadn't of seen this book's movie preview I know I would have liked it and been surprised a lot more  than I was. I would recommend it though, it's written in the exact language of the characters and has a good story line. The climax comes a little late but I think it's worth the wait.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Well it's a great game but in creative mode all you do is build blocks.<br />They should have more stuff like dispensers , red stone , mine carts ,<br />and more.....
0440244412|5.0|After the cliffhanger on book 4 I was very thankful I that  had started reading the series when the 5 books were already out or the wait would have seemed eternal. I didn't think I was going to enjoy this series as much as I did the only reason being there didn't seem to be a lot of romance in it and it was about the same characters throughout  the 5 books. The only other series I had read that was about the same character was Harry Potter but I was used to reading KMM's Highlander series each book about a different character the story began and then that character had its happy ending and then onto the next book. I always liked the mystic aspects of it and the Tuatha D&eacute; Danann being a part of those books but I never thought their world was as vast as it has become.  Mac and Barrons have become one of my favorite characters and their journey has been exhilarating to follow. For those skeptics like me there is enough romance throughout the series and this book really brings it all into perspective and we get a little more into Jericho's mind. He is such a complex and wonderful character I would read 50 more books about him and his men and never be bored. Love this series, love this author, and can't wait to catch up with Mac and Jericho again.
B006BAEQB2|4.0|I've been reading Philippa Gregory novels for quite some time and I have never been disappointed.  Some may frown at her over embellishment of historical figures lives however she is a historical fiction novelist who of course take liberties with history.  Anne and Isabel are daughter of the infamous \\"kingsmaker\\" and although the story is told from Anne's POV, you are not disappointed.  Rich in detail, plot and history this is an excellent novel.  Of course I'd go back and actually read a actual book about the family but this is a pretty good starting point.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Sequels are never as good as the original movie and up until Into Darkness I really hadn't seen one be as good as its predecessor. This movie blew me away, from the beginning until the end I was riveted to my seat waiting for the next reveal to occur. I am not a Star Trek fan and only started watching after J.J Abrams made the first one but for me as a newcomer to this franchise this movie was just fantastic. The plot was interesting and easy to follow, some of the action was a little over the top at times but then again you are in outer space so I guess anything goes, and the camaraderie between the main characters was very fun to watch. A couple of laughs and growth for Kirk's and Spock's character made it very enjoyable as well. Benedict Cumberbatch was just amazing in his role of villain and had me guessing if he actually was the bad guy after all. I am hopeful there will be more movies to follow that are as good as this one.
B005PK1G76|5.0|I didn't want to pay the $20 for the drink carrier that is made for my stroller so I bought this. It works great with my Britax B-agile stroller and I can fold the stroller while the organizer is still attached. I like that it has a zipper pocket for my keys and othe valuables. The drink holder supports my 24oz water bottle just fine and I don't worry about it coming detached.
B0002IQMKM|5.0|Only a couple of stinkers. I not a Talking Heads fanatic. I purchased for the hits and find I like quite a few songs that  I never heard before.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game never gets boring.  My friends and I can play this game for hours.  This game is addicting and even better than temple run.
B009HXG9UQ|4.0|We all loved this movie.  The dialogue is hilariously dead pan, the characters are hard not to love, even if deeply flawed.  The kids loved the adults vs. kids theme and we parents loved the redeeming qualities of the adults in the end, the nostalgia of how it felt to be this age, to run away from home.  One of the best, if quirkiest, movies we've seen in a long time.
B001QU4ZVS|4.0|Wonderful collection of songs, very mute, simple stuff except for a couple of songs with a full band/orchestration. Madeleine's voice is amazing.
B008OOYALE|2.0|For a free game its okay.....like others have said , the constraints are annoying and designed to encourage spending actual money to improve your island and dragons. Before you can play ( every time you load the game )there are lots of in game advertisements that you have to go through . It is glitchy ...for  example ... the daily bonus only shows up randomly even if you log in daily ,and if your neighbors island is too large the game wont load. The dragons are cute, but don't expect to complete a lot of goals unless you are willing to part with some money, sure friends can send you gold ,but they limit it to three gold bars a day that you can send.... some of the dragons cost thousands!!! After you get through all of the continual advertisements, Play the game for the purpose of creating an interesting dragon habitat and you can have fun, but don't expect to be able to complete many goals.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Great game can't stop playing it now my wife left me because this game is my new wife.  It is all good as long as u guys keep updating it.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Spoiler: I don't like that Rick is falling apart. I like my heroes tougher. I Still love the show though.
1454701250|5.0|I follow the writer of the book in her blog, and she is just inspiring me more day after day.<br />As expected her book is great for those who want to learn rubber stamping.<br />Clear images. Clear language. easy to understand.<br /><br />Very nice projects to be created with rubber stamps.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!
B00908DDZM|5.0|Thrift Shop is the number 1 song of the year and it's on this cd. All the songs are great. Love this cd.
B0000028P8|5.0|This is from an era that seems so long ago and I am happy to revisit it!  Mariah shines in this album that features songs from her first two studio albums.  I am so excited that her band went into &#34;Can't Let Go&#34; before the show ended because it is one of the best songs of her whole repertoire!  This album is a must have!
B00A77II0U|5.0|This hidden object game has wonderful graphics and a great story line. I would recommend it to any android user!
B007SGM084|5.0|I have absolutely enjoyed reading this series, I'm glad that I bought it as a trilogy, would have had a hard time waiting for the next book to come out. I enjoyed the characters Christian and Anastasia and how they're love brought out the good in each other with a fight the whole time. I got emotional at some points in the books right along the characters. When I finished the book I was sad that it had to end. I couldn't say which book that I liked more, to me they were equally good and kept me interested right to the end. I finished all three of them in 7 days, wish there was more to the series to come out.<br /><br />It is definitely a book that you will need an open mind to read, there are a lot of surprises along the way!!!!
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|tHIS GAME IS CHALLENGING BUT NOT IMPOSSIBLE. THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT GAMES TO PLAY, SOME GEMES ARE EASIER THAN OTHERS i THINK i LIKE YHIS GAME THE BEST SO FAR
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This was an awesome read. Kept my attention from chapter to chapter. Can hardly wait for the next book. so I can read all the Crossfire Series again, and again. Thank you Sylvia Day!
B0063M22QO|4.0|i FIND THIS A FUN GAME i CAN EITHER REALLY GO FAST OR USE STATEGIC MOVES.  tRY THIS GAME IF YOU LIKE MAHJONG YOU'LL LIKE THIS ONE,
B00846WWVM|4.0|I downloaded this App, for my son to help him with his math and problem and his puzzle solving issues. The school my son attends has this game on the IPads at the school. I saw him play it on Family Math Night so I downloaded it to help him with his math, puzzle, and problem solving issues during the summer months.
B0064UPU4G|5.0|I've always been a Daft Punk fan since their early days in the 90's. I love their music. This is a great album from start to finish.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|having waited for the third book in this series; I was not disappointed<br />Every bit as interesting and colorful as the others.  The Clifton's were<br />an interesting group, and the slight political undertones were well done<br />and made a good story even better!
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|A little predictable but awesome nonetheless. A great finish to the series. Leaves room for a spinoff in the future
067144901X|5.0|This book has been a favorite in our family through three boys and countless nephews and friends.  each one of my boys requested it every day during their toddler/preschool years.  I now get this book to include for every babyshower/new baby gift.
B008478VE8|5.0|Charles Darwin wrote the Origin of Species to answer the question: Who are we?  I am getting a vague idea by reading all of his writings.  He was truly a brilliant man, and along with Alfred Russell Wallace, gave us the first glimpse of the biological world that made sense.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|It is not the best movie in the world. But, I definitely found myself laughing on the floor at certain parts of the movie.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I'm in love with this app.  I was searching for this and didn't even know it. I love you can customize everything, save to favorites to listen anytime as well as preloaded favorites if you don't want to make your own.  The only suggestion would be more sounds and maybe some scenes/themes based on sounds chosen.  Would highly recommend.  Played great with kindle fire and beats headphones.
B00005LC1H|5.0|I remember growing up watching Fawlty Towers and Are You Being Served with my grandmother.  I became a Monty Python fan later on, then rediscovered Fawlty Towers several years ago.  It holds up to the test of time, and I submit that it was Cleese's master work.  So sad (to me) that it was so short lived, but my wife and I frequently rewatch the DVDs.  I look forward to passing this along to my kids when they get older.
B008BU75IQ|3.0|After reading all 3 books of the trilogy,which I enjoyed,I was very disappointed in the way the ending left you  unresolved as to survived. Is Jeffrey Archer planning a 4th book of this series?
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Christina McKenna has a magic way with words. I could &#34;see&#34; all the characters and&#34; feel&#34; the emotions on every page.I loved,loved loved this book!
B00BW5K5DO|5.0|I've enjoyed this game on my laptop and was thrilled that it now is out in a Kindle format.  I've been playing like crazy ever since I downloaded it.  Works just as great on the Kindle as my laptop also.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I'm not done with the book yet, but am 80% through it.  I definitely am enjoying it and have recommended it to several friend and will read the other books in the series.  Can't wait for the movie that will be out this year in August.
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|I absolutely loved the series. This one kind of let me down. I still enjoyed the read but was let down as to the way it built up and then faded away.
B000YGIIPO|5.0|Endlessly inventive. Who new his YA books would be some of his best writing? Read everything he has written, even at his worst he's better than most.
B0066W1AZK|3.0|I don't really like this game I can't do all of the moves I want to at the  Times I want to. Ive played it a lot of times and there's no way to win its really weird.
B007VDN1PA|5.0|Super fast free shipping and very simple to use. I am using it to convert all of my family's (and my wife's family's) old color slides to digital. It is as simple as stick the slide in, press &#34;scan&#34;, it shows up on the screen and automatically adjusts for proper exposure in a second or two, then asks if you want to save, click &#34;enter&#34; for yes, remove, stick another one in and repeat. It takes about 8-10 seconds to insert, scan, save, and remove each slide. What could be easier? I will say as others have said you will need needle nose pliers (or better yet a pair of tweezers which I use) to pull the slides out as it holds them quite snug when inserted so they won't move during the scan process. I purchased the 32 GB card ($18) to stick in it so I could scan directly to it for much faster saving speed than saving to a PC. I'll pull the card and stick that in my computer when it is full to transfer the photos. This scanner also offers some photo editing features but I haven't screwed around with any of them as I'll use my photo editing software on my PC should I wish to edit some after I load the photos to it. After looking online and seeing places that charge 19 cents per slide conversion to digital, for $80 or whatever this cost it is an absolute steal. Finally, someone made something that works very well and is simple to use. I've scanned over 1,000 slides so far. I've no idea how many can be held on the 32 Gig card I bought but the on-screen counter stops at 9,999. I have yet to need to pull the card and transfer the photos to my PC.
