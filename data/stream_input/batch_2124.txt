B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I doubt anyone could fail to fall in love with Downton Abbey.  This period piece is beautiful, addicting, and well worth the investment in the entire series.  I grew to like the actor Brendan Coyle, valet in Downton, in his role in 'Larkrise to Candleford' and was thrilled to see him in Downton Abbey.  Sir Julian created a series that deals with the Spanish Flu, WW1 and loss of family and friends, broken hearts, romance, loss of funds, new beginnings...they are all a part of this wonderful series. Saying any more would give too much away.

B00003CXUM|5.0|I am not an expert, or a critic, I am just a movie lover. Wong Kar Wai is without a doubt my favorite Chinese director and one of my all times favorite directors at all. Like all his movies &#34;In the Mood for Love&#34; is a simple love story told in a very unique and unusual way. It is visually ELEGANT, SENSUAL, ROMANTIC and extremely GORGEOUS despite of the dark and claustrophobic environment and not so pretty backdrop of Hong Kong in the early 60's. The way he uses the camera and the way the characters interact and move around, sometimes in slow motion at the pace of the beautiful music is unique and extremely sensual. The body language and the facial expressions of the characters speak more than the words missing due to the sometimes lack of dialogs. He makes even simple things like the smoke of a cigarette rising to the ceiling looks very beautiful and sensual. The costumes are magnificent; especially the cheongsams wore by the main female character, they are also used as reference of the changes in time. The soundtrack is beautiful and indeed is part of the story or a character itself. As with all his movies, despite of the sometimes slow pace and the lack of dialogs, you cannot take your eyes off the screen and once finished you cannot take it out of your mind. I am among Mr. Kar Wai’s biggest fans and I own all his movies released so far!!!! The Criterion Collection edition is really fabulous with a lot of bonus features!!!!!!!!!!
B00AFEY354|5.0|Compared to the book, of course it is not as great, but the movie did the book justice.<br />Highly recommended for people that have read the book.
B005LAIHYU|1.0|This is the stupidist vampire movie EVER made...and i've been watching them for 40 years...don't believe the hype cause this movie sucks...would have been better if they would have shot abraham lincoln in the back of the head when the movie started!

B0014EU5XI|5.0|What can i say about this band that hasn't already been said? Nothing. If your a fan you already have all of these songs. However if you ever played guitar hero and wanted to hear some more of ZZ Top then you have found the holy grail. This album has pretty much every hit they had on it and the price is right.
B003VANOFY|4.0|Comfort: 4.5 Stars due to the fact that they feel loose around my head. Also they do not grip hard enough so if I lean over i have to be careful they don't fall off. Probably meant for larger heads.<br /><br />Sound: 4 stars since the bass gets very distorted at higher volume levels extremely easy. Additionally the sound is very tinny and as others have stated even after you establish your settings once you restart you lose them.<br /><br />Ease of use: 4 stars because it is simple enough to set up profiles. The minus a star comes from the inability to permanently save those profiles.<br /><br />Microphone: 5 stars I had compliments that I sounded clearer when using various VOIP programs like skype, Team Speak, Ventrilo and Mumble. It does pick up background but not to the extent that it is obnoxious or overpowering... unless you have a kid yelling in the background =P<br /><br />Value: 4 stars simply because I had some $60 microsoft headphones for 2 years and the only plus these have is the wireless and voice alteration over them.<br /><br />Cons- I had a few issues with my computer recognizing the headphones via the USB. If you have the same issue where it won't recognize them try unplugging your desktop speakers... No clue why it took that... Afterwards I reconnected my speakers and have not seen that issue reoccur.<br /><br />If you have the cash to spend these are great, however, if not there are similar wired headphones for cheaper that will suffice.

B0017SWPXY|5.0|Wonderful read. It was neat to have it told from a dog's perspective. Hard to read and cry through the last chapter, but we'll worth it.
B005LAIHRC|4.0|Rock of Ages was better than expected because it portrays the relationships that create the emotions that is then expressed through the music. I'm not a huge 80's fan, but Rock of Ages made the music make sense through the interaction of the characters and the music. When the movie started I thought if the entire movie was a musical that would probably get too annoying, but it is not a musical completely as there is some talking. It is not a kids movie, but the sensual scenes are only implied but still probably for adult viewing as nothing is shown more than a bunch of suggestive intimate dancing with a lot of kissing assertively that is still probably suited more for adult viewing. In the beginning of the movie I thought what is this style of movie, then I was like it's kind of unique yet corny, then by the end of the movie I thought it was actually a pretty entertaining different type of movie and I was into it and ready to rock. There is only a few movies that I watch more than once, and while this probably isn't spectacular as a serious movie, I will watch it again with a few fun friends so we can Rock On.

B000FC12C8|4.0|This book is an all time classic and should be studied by everyone with a basic education in finance and economics.  The revisions are very helpful as they give more current examples of the concepts discussed.<br /><br />Figure and example graphics are an issue in all Kindle books that have them because they do not change in size with the fonts and can't be resized.<br /><br />This book by Benjamin Graham is definitely a five star book and I have a first edition in physical book form, but the Kindle version of the book sucks because of the graphics deficiency.

B00A0MJA1I|5.0|Well i been waiting for Peter Pan to come out on blu ray for months now since i searched the internet to see when it would be released and it's finally here. I won't talk about the story since everyone pretty much knows it. The picture quality looks amazing in blu ray. It's very clear throughout the movie, bringing it new life like your watching it for the first time. While i haven't watched all the special features yet, i have to say from glancing over them they look really good. The growing up with nine old men documentary is an awesome documentary about the kids of some of the original Disney artists and how it was growing up with their fathers working for Walt Disney. The blu ray menu is really cool and travels through Neverland as you navigate it. My two complaints about the release are 1. On the blu ray packaging for the 2 disc edition Peter and the Darling children have been made to look more modernish and Micheal's pajamas are blue instead of pink and 2. There's no cover art on the blu ray disk. Disney usually puts a lot of work overall in their blu ray releases and I've been disappointed to see on the last couple releases no art on the disks. Overall these are just two little complaints and overall it's the movie that's important.

B004H0M8EA|1.0|This book presents a lot of information, but no discernible th&egrave;me.  The author doesn't tie the information together with an opinion of why something is good or bad.  For example, Montana is poorly suited for agriculture; the rivers are fouled with fertilizer runoff & salinization caused by agriculture; outsiders have bought up farmland and converted to estates. Does the author propose that the last item is a good thing or a bad thing?  Why?  He also relates the transition, in a later chapter, of primitive island society changing from inherited hierarchical leadership to leadership by victorious warlords. What's the point?  I have no notion that one is more desirable than the other, and the author gives me no understanding of why this transition is significant.
0061122416|3.0|So the whole time I'm reading this book I felt that it read like a fable.  And it wasn't until I came online that I saw that it technically is a fable judging from the title posted here on the internet.  My book didn't have the subtitle of \\"A Fable About Following Your Dream\\" on the cover.  So that explains a lot.  And like most fables, there is a lesson to be learned in this book.<br /><br />Santiago is a shepherd who has always had a want for traveling the world.  After some strange dreams, he consults a gypsy to help him interpret them and she sets him off on an adventure to find treasure near the great pyramids.  Along his journey though, he'll meet several interesting people and have several mishaps.  But he'll learn the true meaning of finding himself and what his dreams in life are.<br /><br />Santiago is an ok character.  He's a pretty smart guy even if he does spend most his time running after sheep.  But I do think that the lessons this fable imparts come a little too easy for him.  He doesn't seem to struggle much in the mental sense, just the physical when he's robbed or beaten or the other things that befall him.  And the people he meets always impart lessons to him or teach him new things in life.  And to an extent I think that's true when you compare it to real life, but the lessons aren't usually as obvious as they are presented in this book.<br /><br />The journey itself was interesting.  I found it well paced although not exciting.  But I thought the lessons and symbolism to be a little heavy handed.  If you don't understand anything philosophical don't worry about reading this book, it will be handed to you.  And I think that ruins the message a little bit because there's nothing for the reader to figure out themselves.  I'm not saying the tone needs to be mysterious, but it doesn't need to be dumbed down to quite the level that it is.  There are also a lot of different terms that the author uses to present his beliefs in this book and those seemed a little cheesy as well.  I think it would have been more professional to not title ever thought or symbol in the book.<br /><br />I would call this good light reading when you need something positive.  Since this book is about pursuing your dreams it can be inspiring.  It just it spelled out so easily for the reader that it loses some of its charm and interest in the telling.<br /><br />The Alchemist<br />Copyright 1993<br />167 pages + reader's guide, etc.<br /><br />Review by M.

B004YRSBTW|5.0|Memento is well executed because despite what appears to be disjointed and confusing scenes quickly ties into congruent segments to form a comprehensible whole. Perhaps it is not wholly unique but nonetheless... (Where am I? I'm at a computer. Whats on the screen? That looks like my writing.) it is a brilliant film. Unforgettable.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|Very boring and slow in the beginning, but then the story picked up.  Still a teen romance with unlikely characters.
B00AGOGOLE|3.0|I have a hard time trying to figure out how to work the camera. One thing I dislike is you can't see what you are trying to take a picture of.  Also , when you are aiming the camera, you can't see the button to take the picture. As with all the kindle products, instructions would be nice.
B00683JK9K|4.0|I tried Magic Puzzles on my son's Kindle Fire.  It has beautiful pictures for the puzzles.  The app seems to work very smoothly.  It's not hard to get a grasp on what the goal is or how to achieve it.  My son is 6 and he enjoys doing the puzzles on Free Time too.
1451627289|5.0|I have never read Stephen King before as I always thought his writing too pedestrian, but11/22/63 definitely changed my mind. A very carefully woven plot that keep the reader hooked from the beginning and what a twist in the end.  A study in why not alter history.  A fantastic read!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Amazing book very powerful I loved this book it will always be my favorite and will always be close to my heart
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great plot, but a little slow at times as  I felt the characters had to be developed.  Gone Girl is well written with lots of nuances. A great fast read!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My son, his friends, and I love this game. Hours of entertainment. I do not know what we would have donewhen we were sick with out this game.
B00395ZYVS|4.0|I felt the door left open for a sequel.  A good read with lots of twists and turns, but somewhat predicable characters.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I found this book to be a little slow at the beginning but after a short while I could not put it down.  Great story and very, very interesting.  I'm very proud of you Marcus.  We all are.
B008M87GJK|5.0|Seeing the news with different eyes is wonderful!  It is one of the best coverages, adding to one's own perspective.
B00846F1YW|4.0|This is a good app, I can't stop playing it! Be careful you will get hooked because you just have to see where this mystery is going.
0061438294|4.0|I watched a Joe Navarro's interview in a columbian documentary about Luis Garavito and he really has a lot of experience in this field.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|i really like this little ap if only the kindle battery was as good. i would recommend it. easy to install understand and informative. especially good as it is free to download.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|A little on the depressing side at times, but interesting throughout.  Great acting surprised this movie didnt get more word of mouth buzz.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The writing, editing, and acting are beyond compare!  This series is addicting, just about done catching up on all prior episodes, won't know what to do with myself when the series is on hiatus.
B0070Y46UY|1.0|I am sure the movie is a tour de force of special effects, but sadly think Hollywood has gone astray again in thinking they have their hands on an &#34;important&#34; story that has some deeper meaning.  Sadly, it does not.  I found very little about the character of Pi to be life affirming or morally informing.  Other than the fact that this made-up character is supposed to have survived a ship sinking (not really a spoiler as they give that away in the first chapter or so), I don't see anything especially significant about this.  Read Kon-Tiki if you want a gripping survival story that actually happened.  Additionally, this is not a story about altrustic devotion.  The only reason the tiger doesn't get kicked off the boat right away is because he can't figure out how to get rid of him.  If you love animals, don't read this.  About every second page or so, another animal bites the dust.  I found it very disturbing.  The final chapter adds in some strange psychological nonesense to give it a twist.  In my opinion, the twist is lame and if you accept the twist as being this character's truth, then it nullifies everything else you just slogged through reading in the entire story!  The only bright side is that having read the story and found it devoid of significance, I saved myself from having wasted the time and money seeing it in the theater.  Were I a book editor or a studio exec, I would have dumped this one in the slag pile.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great story line.  If you like english you will like this.  Pick it up today at Amazon dot com.  Enjoy.

B0094BB4TW|1.0|This update sucks. It won't let me reply to any notifications it just gives me an error message and when trying to read previous comments, it is just a duplicate of the comments below.

B0084B5TK8|5.0|Thought I'd check this book it since I've never read it and it's a classic. I loved it. I loved the style and pace of it. It was interesting to read about the original vampire and his qualities. I did not have a problem with this digital version and thought it was quite good. Very entertaining read.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I haven't read a book in a long time that has truly made me keep changing my opinions and inspired such genuine hatred and compassion for characters. It will definitely get you hooked from the first reading.
030758836X|5.0|The first book I had ever read by author Gillian Flynn was [[ASIN:B002U3CCKQ Dark Places]], and I devoured it! So, I went on to read her first book, [[ASIN:0307341550 Sharp Objects: A Novel]] which was equally as great. You have to understand for me to say that these books were better than good is no easy feat for the 'Mystery\\" genre. I absolutely despise mystery novels! But Gillian takes it so much further than just a mystery, it is like a psychological thriller in some ways, a whodunit in other ways, and just plain mind blowing! She keeps throwing curve balls just when you think you've got it figured out...<br /><br />'Gone Girl' starts out as a whodunit, to a 'oh duh he did it'. She leads you into believing the husband did it, and then throwing a curve ball to make you second guess yourself, and when you're so sure he didn't do it.. WHAM she throws another and once again you're doubting yourself. So she kept me guessing the WHOLE time. I could no quite predict what Amy's next move was and for me that was the best part of the book. It gets boring reading all these books where you can predict how the sister is going to die but the family moves on or the boy and girl gets married happily ever after. While the 'unrealistic' story plot got under some people's skin I preferred it. Gillian did not fail to keep me on my toes as she had with her two previous books.<br /><br />The only downfall of this book is it can get slow in some chapters but she also keeps you hanging in there with all the curve balls and tidbits of information she gives you. You know there is just some ugly monster waiting to rear its ugly little head out just around the corner.<br /><br />I recommend this book if you don't mind over the top slightly unrealistic characters like Amy or Nick. If you LOVE to keep guessing and getting huge surprises then this is the book for you. Honestly it is great. I do recommend reading her first two books as well! It is a must! And if you're already a fan of her other books then this is a must read and it will excite you!
B004FRX0MY|1.0|This app only allows you to download your music to internal storage which is limited and valuable. No ability to save to external SD card by 2013 is a massive failure by a massive company.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|I don't remember this purchase, but we were just discussing the other day if I had seen it and I knew I had.  I remember it was a good movie so I must have been happy with my purchase.
B00846F1YW|5.0|I love the hidden object games. And the story line is pretty good also. This definitely was a great free app of the day.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I've really enjoyed the game and we play it many times in the evenings.  I've got it and we just put it on my son's kindle fire and it's like a competition now!
B003UBTX6S|5.0|This is truly one of the best series I have read.  It actually is very hard to put the book down.  It picked up right where the first book left off and was filled with excitement from beginning to end.  I am now downloading the next in this series.  This is a wonderful escape from reality!
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Great movie, LOVE all the super heroes! This was an excellent addition to my Marvel movie collection. No scratches on the disc, no damage to case, excellent!

B0057UA4FY|5.0|My son LOVES the Clone Wars component of Star Wars. We bought this repackaged version for a cheaper price than brand new ones and they discs are in excellent condition. So glad I didn't pay full price. Arrived very fast too.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Sometimes I wanted to throw the book.  Over and over the unbelievable main characters say and do the same unrealistic things.  Why keep restating the stupid obvious.
0375805621|5.0|My kids LOVED this book when I purchased it. They were 2 and 3 at the time. They would giggle and laugh at each page. The board style book holds up to toddler hands. Cute continuation of the original Monster at the End of this Book which I used to read as a child.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This series was very scarry for me but I was so entranced I had to see what happend next and then next show, next season.  The  actors are really good
0375805613|5.0|Perfect for toddlers/preschoolers. My children were 2 and 3 when we started reading this book and they LOVED it. The board  style of the book holds up to little hands.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|The free version is fantastic and great fun.  I downloaded this and have played it everyday since.  It is very addictive, you find yourself wanting to collect all the prizes in each room.  When you get a little bored with bingo you can play slots as well.  You don't get near enough free games at first, but add your FB friends and chat in the rooms and before you know it you'll have a great time in this game.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|My children (3 yr old twins and a 4 yr old) have been watching this movie every holiday season for 2 years now, and still continue to love it every time. My kids are all fascinated by trains and the visuals are great. I love Tom Hanks voice and the story is very touching, and speaks to the true meaning of the holiday. Great gift too for any child!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|kept you interested<br />some parts are crude but you need to consider who the guy is that is saying these things, I guess
0446569909|5.0|I was never a die hard fan of Ozzy or Black Sabbath but this book was great. I can't believe how much I learned about Black Sabbath and Ozzy as a solo artist. Once I picked it up I couldn't stop reading.It made me get some downloads of the early Black Sabbath music to to refresh myself. You can really hear Ozzy talking while you read this. The photos were great too.
B002XWXPC8|4.0|Been waiting to watch this movie for a long while.. It's a classic to me and shows great actors @ their best...
B0070Y46UY|4.0|This story was beautifully written which I love. There were parts when he was on the boat I felt dragged on a bit. However, all in all, I would recommend.
B005LAIHYU|5.0|As if the undead were not popular enough with the Twilight movies and all the shows that are incorporating ghosts, vampires, and werewolves (technically not undead); this movie basically says &#34;What if...&#34;<br /><br />It is outrageous and has some fun little history bits in it. My understanding is that the movie is based on a graphic novel.
0765325950|5.0|Robert Jordan is my all time favorite author.  Brandon Sanderson did a great job filling some very large shoes after Jordan's passing.  Great book!
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Amazing book, excellent writing & detail. Loved every page. Didn't really like how girlie he was about things. Most definitely would read again
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Lots of fun!  Harder than the original version, but easy enough that the kids (4 & 6) like playing the game too.

B007IK44CK|3.0|Ya know...Im a fan of the other Mission Impossibles but this one was just kinda...stale...Yea, I think that is an adequate description...stale.  After watching it I felt like I should have thrown on a &#34;Die Hard&#34; instead.

1451695195|5.0|I go to Mass weekly, but this book was so amazingly helpful in helping to make sense of why we are here, what our ultimate purpose is, how we are all connected, and the perils and blessings of free will.  This book is great for anyone who wants to grow and be their strongest self, despite religious affiliation (or lack of one).  I also loved the author's perspective as a Neurosurgeon.

B005GSY23M|5.0|I love this soundtrack. I throw it on my MP3 player and ride around on town on my motorcycle and just try to be as cool as Ryan Gosling. It doesn't work obviously, but dang, this soundtrack makes you feel awesome.
B008D30K7E|5.0|... which should not be missed! Can one person really be that lucky? Also, you can't beat that Kindle price tag!
B003JTHXOK|3.0|I was a little disappointed in this book.  Seemed predictable.  I usually like his books but there was little new or different in this book.

B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I love Angry Birds, its so much fun, frustating too but the fun outways the frustration.  Once you try it you won't want to stop.
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|Dragonvale is a entertaining app but I got it played for a couple months then one day I logged on to find that everything was gone. My dragons and everything. So don't work to much on it or when you lose it you'll be really Sad.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love having the weather channel on my kindle, I can check it and find out what will be happening at home or where we are traveling too.  A must to have.

B007N5YIUS|5.0|I find the space one alittle bit more challenging the the others but its worth it.  Try flying into space with the birds.
0763655465|5.0|Since the day he was born, my son has loved Chris's books. I'm so happy he published another one and so is my 2yr old. The images are art and the story is lovely. One of our favs!
B008DVW7DQ|5.0|One of hte best DVDs for an evenining of great singing by a master of the art who is serious, funny, reverent and irrevent at the same time.  A masterpiece.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I just bought a kindle and tried this free app. It has all the features I like to use. I can store locations and see their weather quickly. The radar is speedy too. Thanks!
B00AESN8XY|3.0|It is a good game. I was more excited when I first tried it out. But then after always losing no matter what I tried....it got old quick. Entirely to confusing and it is not fun after a few times of trying and failing.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|I love this period of history and watched the whole season in one day. The instant video was clear on my Ipad just like watching it on my television.
B001BEK8E2|5.0|great film lottsa samurais rustic rural settings reel gud whodunnit i loved it it loved me etc wow what a film

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Yes if I could give a perfect ten this book would deserve it. Beautiful, breathtaking, poetry with words. I laughed, I cried and boy was I mad. A roller coaster of emotions. I found myself thinking about this book all day, playing the plot over and over in my head.<br /><br />Beautifully written
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This series is one the the best in years.<br />In terms of pure entertainment it ranks up there with Roots;Lonesome Dove;all of Ken Burns excellent series,etc.<br />It has engaging characters,great plot and sub-plots,intelligent dialogue, and terrific sets and settings.<br />It is a genuine &#34;Don't Miss&#34; series-go for it !
B006MW3V6U|5.0|My sister bugged me forever to watch this show, I am so glad she did.  I LOVE this show, and watching on my Kindle is a great way to catch up
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|Good take on the story of the Alien franchise.  I'm waiting for more movies and see where the story goes.
B005LAII80|1.0|Was extremely disappointed it this movie, it was more like watching someone playing a game, was boring!  The first Judge Dredd was good, was expected more of the same, but didn't get it.
B001GCUO1Q|4.0|This is a good movie.  At least the next movie won't have to deal with the origin story that we all know.  Hugh Jackman can do no wrong playing Wolverine.
B00915G6YE|5.0|so sorry this series ended, I think it's the best on TV.  I have the entire series and have watched it two times already
B001UGB1X8|3.0|I had not heard of this movie until I came across it when I was browsing one evening. Having lived in Louisiana and traveled extensivley in South Louisiana over the years, I have a lot of affection for the Cajun atmosphere. Tommy Lee Jones plays a small town lawman trying to solve the murder of a woman that leads him on a frustrating path that leaves the viewer puzzled in places when you wonder what isn't being said.<br /><br />At any rate, Tommy Lee prevails and gets his man in the end. Meanwhile, we get to follow along with him as he does his homework. How he came to some of his conclusions, however, are not all that clear. Since he is native to the area and is known by everyone, that's where the missing dots come into play.<br /><br />Still, I found it to be an entertaining film, if not Tommy Lee's best effort.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Such a well written memoir of a truly amazing story. Eben's experience changed his life and and reading his story changed mine as well. Amazing!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|super cool and super fun it feels like you really are with a real horse sort of except your not obviously
1572816295|5.0|This deck is original,  beautiful,  artistic,  fun,  symbolic.  Every time you can found new elements in it as well as the traditional RWS symbols.
1582701709|5.0|I have read this book once & had to buy the book after reading it to start my collection of inspiring books. There are not many that I have enjoyed as much as this one! I love it!
B008JGSM6G|3.0|It is lots of fun in the beginning but it get boring after a while. Even as the game gets more complex the patterning is essentially the same.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|This is my second N. Sparks novel and all I can say is get comfortable....plan ahead and make a weekend out of it!!!<br />I could cry like a baby right in this moment. I just, literally, finished reading it and I feel pressure in my chest from the raw emotion conjured up from the pages.<br />#Bittersweet<br />\\"...a love like that, is like a glimpse of heaven!\\"
B000FC2L1E|5.0|I have read this series many times, so that my hardcopies have fallen apart and I am now collecting them on the Kindle!  This book in the series continues the superb story telling of Diana Gabaldon where she chronicles the lives of Jamie and Claire.  If you like historical fiction with a strong cast of characters, mystery, adventure and a bit of romance, this book (and the series!) may be for you.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|best game ever i love the railroad and the zipline but I do miss the football player but I don't know if the cheat works
B00000K3UU|5.0|I have always loved Big Daddy. It's only natural I'd want to buy it. I purchased it from amazon for cheap, and it was new, still had the plastic on it. I'm very pleased with my purchase and if you love Big Daddy or other Adam Sandler movies, you'll love it too!
B00846F1YW|5.0|ENJOY PLAYING THESE TYPES OF GAMES. IT HAS GREAT GRAPHICS AND WORKS GREAT WITH MY KINDLE FIRE. ALL AGES WILL LIKE PLAYING THIS GAME. NOT SO TOUGH TO PLAY. HAVE FUN PEOPLE!
B0070Y46UY|4.0|It sure held my attention.  And, I learn some interesting facts about animals, zoos and about a culture different from my own.  I kept think to my self, how would I handle the situations confronting the young man in the story.
B005LHOKFS|2.0|just can't seem to do anything with it. Had planes all set then all of a sudden it says &#34;tripadvisor has stopped&#34; every single time I go on. What am I doing wrong? Do I need to sign in, tried that thru facebook and it still has that message. Am I the only one that's happening to?Trying Kayak, see how that works, so far no messages for me. If anyone has an ideas why this happening, please let me know!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This is an excellent book. A must read, modern romance. Every girl only dreams of finding this. . . .
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This show has been a surprise from the very beginning. My brother teases me for watching it, but it's a show BOTH my wife and I enjoy.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|My wife likes this movie, so I guess it's good for those who love this kind of movies. I personally don't care.
B009VSW15Y|4.0|You have to have the app to use your kindle to take pics with. It is easy to use and necessary.
1451608659|5.0|It is always great to learn and understand the life of Sports or Olympics with someone who tell us how to raise and training and other things.  I enjoy this book.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Of course it is easy to use and allows you to get on fb with your tablet and not have to use your phone or computer.
B00BESIKWM|4.0|I realize there is a fair number of people who do not like this movie, and I guess we all have our likes and dislikes.  Without really going into the story, something that you'll have to see for yourself...especially if you have played Silent Hill 3 as many times as I've played it.  First off is the image of the movie.  I think the director and photographers and all did a wonderful job giving us the Silent Hill dreamy to nightmare quality.  I think that the image of Silent Hill in all its ways comes clear in the visuals.  As for the demons, the creatures weren't your usual monsters as in most films, these are beasts that (as any Silent Hill fan knows) comes out of the deepest recesses of the mind and soul.  If you are a Clive Barker fan, then some of the horrors will remind you of some of his best works.  The story line is something familiar to us as we've seen the first film and played the first and the third video game.  You know these characters and I think the actors and writers do a good job presenting these main characters.  For me, I hope there is a third film that focuses on the search for the missing wife/mother.  Not something to spend much $$s on, but something to keep if you find it in a discount counter.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|I know nothing about any of the angry bird games, but my 10 year old requested this one and seems to enjoy playing it.
B00AMBM9MO|5.0|My teddy rukspin never came alive but if it had I would have wanted this friend, maybe not into my adult life. The Script was great, but I would not want minors watching this.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|Of course you can find almost anything with this google app. You have to narrow down what you are looking for a bit more, but you should find what you want pretty easily.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|A true life relationship displayed out well by both! I agree she is better as a scout than an another Dumb A** Attorney. Clint shows how a dad can have communication barriers with his children and even though they cannot understand his reason, it goes to show that sometimes it's better to leave things in the past.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Good app that tells national and local weather in your area. Gives up to date and immediate info on the weather.
B00A757EFW|5.0|pac-man  is a game i will love forever me and my husband played every day and meet the friend of a live time there will never be a greater game for me
0545265355|5.0|I received my order really fast and came in just like described.  Thanks so much for quick and great service.  Still havnt read the books but will soon.  So far everyone that has read them loves them.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|this game is ok i like rpg better some thing with a story some you have to have a goal not just kill kill kill
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved it just as much as the first. I can't wait to start the third book. I'm in love with this series.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|like to keep up with family and friends and keep up on what is going on some thing you can check with a phone
B001LM1456|3.0|It's good for the kind of movie it is. The hulk should have been the same from the avengers, but Ed Norton is a great actor so it's ok.
B006TLFPKO|5.0|I may be older, but I still enjoy a fun romp at the cinema. I love the chemistry of all these characters, so the story is a bit of fluff, why not? It's an addicting sort of fluff! It's a great escape from the real world if only but for a few hours!
B008OOYALE|5.0|I am really enjoying this game. I really like visiting all my neighbors to see their islands at different levels. I really think all neighbors should be able to receive gold instead of just 3 at a time though. Starting out is kind of hard since you need lots of coin.. food..and gold but playing is worth it.
B003EVWDR0|5.0|This movie is visually stunning, has a fabulous musical score, plus tells a great story! What is there possibly not to like?
B008CLI4N4|5.0|I absolutely love this series. For the most part it follows the books, which I would also highly recommend. And well, I now have the hots for Kit Harington, so of course I have to keep watching! haha
B00275EHJG|5.0|bought this for grandkids. they love this movie. the movie was a great price and delivery was just on time, thankyou....grandkids arrived right after,thankyou
B002BWP49M|1.0|Não vale a pena. O sistema de entrega é muito dispendioso. Fui taxada em 78 reais por uma encomenda de 15 dólares.
B005LAIHPE|5.0|needed it bad, when we rented it, price was perfect-delivery was fast. thankyou, would recommend this movie to anyone. we enjoy over and over again.
B001UV4XFQ|1.0|Não vale a pena. O sistema de entrega é muito dispendioso. Fui taxada em 78 reais por uma encomenda de 15 dólares.
B00005MK9Y|5.0|This is a remaster and the sound is crisp and clear. The bass reverberates and the highs are very clear. I had a copy of the original release, and I would have to say this is superior. Released in '78 from tapes of a European tour, it is some of Marley's best known recordings. If you enjoy Bob Marley, this is a must have.
B00B2LRK7W|5.0|Hatebreed has always been improving and often  only a few song I like but with this CD everything is just super awesome! Hatebreed takes it to the next level!
B002PHVHFI|5.0|When I first adopted this mysteriously titled compact disc into my foster home of wayward muzak, I knew I had struck pure gold.  Fellow Amazonians, this album is so fantastic you need not even listen to it--just pour yourself a PBR and snuggle up in your organic firs and engage in the cover art.  However, when I slapped this daddy-o into my 8-track, the subsequent reverberations enlivened my fuchsia living space.  The third track, \\"Needle in a Haystack\\",  reminded me of the difficult upbringing I suffered at the hands of a transgender housemaid who never returned my newly-cleaned undergarments.  In fact, if you play the last song until the very end, you will be able to make out a slight squaking sound.  If you amplify this while playing it backwards and through an Enigma system, I am told you will be given a sneak peek of We Bought a Zoo: Anemalz Fiyyt Baq.  I digress--this album has become the centerfold of my collection, and, henceforth, whenever I venture to the Village in search of new threads or fedoras, I will be boppin my wazoo to these seminal vibes while by shiatsu waddles in disbelief.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was just as engaging as the first, Suzanne Collings is a wonderful writer and it truly shows in Catching Fire.  I almost liked it better than the first!
B0095ZMMCK|3.0|Great stories! They are always written in a way that are thought provoking and make you think. They always come up with a twist.
B00136Q342|5.0|A master entertainer at his best and the recording is superb. You get a sense of the acoustics of the prison. If you have never heard Cash before, this is a great place to start.
B001NHNG64|4.0|Great stories! They are always written in a way that are thought provoking and make you think. They always come up with a twist.
B00136JQMI|5.0|These songs have played through my head for 20 years. I always get this feeling of flying when I hear this record. The record is spacious without being sparse and it is easy to listen to without being &#34;adult contemporary.&#34;
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Great stories! They are always written in a way that are thought provoking and make you think. They always come up with a twist.
B008G8SFGO|3.0|Has some good songs, It's a Long Way Down has a surprsingly fresh sound and is probably the best Kiss song to come out in since Domino.  It's a bit insulting listening to Peter and Ace imitations on a couple songs, but for $7 I couldn't resist.
B008Y6WPXC|2.0|Had hopes given the cast.  Sadly, Arnold only had a cameo.  Wow is Dolf awful or what.  The movie did set a record for cheesy looking blood splatters.  We started playing a version of &#34;Bob' ....
B006M4RN3U|5.0|I bought this for my brother for Christmas because he had heard one of the songs. Well, now that he's heard the whole album, he loves every song. This group is hot. They just won some major grammy awards. Everyone is talking about Fun. You should too!
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|My boys LOVE this movie. After we received it in the mail they have probably watched it 20 times over the last two months. They know it by heart already.<br /><br />The movie itself has a pretty good storyline, although it has been done before many many times. But who does not love to watch a father and son team up to be the ultimate Robot Bashing Heroes against the evil corporate raider set out to take the heart out of sports to make the most financial potential. It is a typical David vs.Goliath story with a lot of humour and touching moments thrown in to make it a well rounded storyline. While the ending does have a bit of a realistic twist you are not disappointed with it at all.<br /><br />If you are looking for a good family movie or just plain good old fashion hero story this is definitely one to add to your collection.<br /><br />The DVD purchase came from Amazon directly. It was packaged perfectly, the shipping was quick and efficient as usual and I had no complaints on the actual product condition at all. I highly recommend buying from Amazon directly any chance you get.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I haven't finish it because I've been really bussy but is really good. I subject you to buy it !
B004XWLN20|4.0|We never watched this when the series was still going but after watching a few episodes here and there on TNT I decided to buy the entire series. I did a lot of shopping around before I found this set and the price for the complete series with all of the extra content and extra memorabilia was a fantastic deal.<br /><br />The series itself is well done and although it does not stick to the traditional Superman storyline it is very well done. My only complaint throughout the entire series is Clark's unreasonable obsession with Lana Lang. By season 3 I was almost to a hate level of Lana Lang and could not stand the way Clark was so willing to destroy heaven and earth for this girl. Lex Luthor and his father are brilliant in this story line. While undoubtedly the villians of the story you really grow to care about their characters and lives right along with everyone else. I loved where the story started going in the last couple of seasons and really felt disappointed that they ended the series when they were finally starting to get into the meat of Superman/Clark's story. Although this series was meant to be about Clark Kent growing up to be the Superman we all know and love, it had a lot of potential to continue on for a long time.<br /><br />I know there have been complaints about the way the discs are packaged in this set. The packaging is a little tight slipping the discs in and out of the sleeves to start with but after I discovered the method to their madness of getting them out it was no big deal. I love how it is done in a book style. The only petty little complaint I have is that it does not fit on my traditional DVD shelves like all of the other collections I have currently. Which really is no big deal.<br /><br />The condition of the discs were perfect and all discs played well. There was only one episode on season 3 disc 3 that hung up but we were able to push through it without missing more than a few seconds of content. That is the only reason I am givingthis a 4 star instead of a 5 star review.<br /><br />I have recommended this set to several friends and family already and more than likely will continue to as long as it is offered on Amazon for this superb price.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|I loved this. Although my husband said it was just another bring it on movie. I disagreed and had me laughing the whole time
B0063IH60K|5.0|Works great on nook color under cm 7. Exactly what I was lookking for. 15 16 17 18 19 20.
B00821PCJS|3.0|Only watched the first episode. It was an ok show, I love end of the world shows/ movies. But it wasn't as good as others.
B007UK83S4|4.0|Very honest and informative, enlightening the reader to the fact that Mr Townshend is a lot more complex, interesting and creative than he may appear when &#34;thrashing around&#34; in his stage persona.<br />A thoroughly enjoyable read. I was sorry when it came to an end, and felt it could have been longer and perhaps a little more detailed. Maybe the story can continue seeing as the author still appears to be in creative mode.<br />I am always mindful of the fact that nostalgia plays a large part in the enjoyment of these biographies, especially when the reader has connections with places and events described.
B008Y5FNL4|4.0|Godfather director and great cast.  Besides the known big names in the movie, there are smaller appearances by a young Harrison Ford, Laurence Fishburne, Dennis Hopper and a great cameo by the man that changed Rock n Roll- Bill Graham.
B007SGM084|5.0|First book/series I have purchased for my Kindle.  Ordering it was a breeze, and it's amazing how it is downloaded instantly.  The books are about obviously what all the hype is out there, but there is a great love story to it as well.  You really get hooked on the characters, Christian and Ana.  A good deal of mystery to the book as well.  I couldn't put it down.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I found myself with quite a bit of time lately, and I decided to see what all the fuss was about vis a vis Downton. While it takes a few episodes for the drama to get going, it's instantly apparent a lot of effort went into making the house, town, and props period-relevant and realistic. Everything is simply gorgeous!<br /><br />Highly recommend!
630467578X|5.0|I've been looking for this movie for a long time. It was delivered on time and in great shape. I've had a lot of fun watching this movie. I will be happy to recommend Amazon any time for movies.
B00001OH7N|5.0|I love Bowie. I love his sense of music as an art form. I love how he can just create stuff from thin air, and make it magical. How he can create a mood on each album and make it uniquely Bowie, and simultaneously creating a new persona and even pop culture template for the world to experience and emulate for the future. Okay... I won't lick his underside too much. But he deserves every bit of adoration and rock idol awe. And this particular album is a testament to his greatness and his genius. At first you may not think this is one of his best, but you'd be dead wrong. Just listen to it for a few months, popping it in your player or mixing it (as a whole album) into your ipod, and it will dawn on you that this is a fantastic album worth high praise. These songs, if not immediately awesome to your ears, will soon find a home within your very musical soul. Especially if you have an interest in Bowie at all. So very rock and roll, so very un-rock and roll as well. So very Bowie. If you were to require a genuine Bowie experience that isn't Ziggy, then this is it. There is just so much here. Hard rockin' tunes, mellow tunes, strange tunes, every bit of this album is epic. Give it a chance. You will come to love it as I do. Really. It really does grow on you. (And try and forget about how absolutely awful the original American \\"cartoon\\" cover was. Because it is probably one of the most disgraceful, poorly conceived album covers ever. But the reintroduction of the cover in his \\"man-dress\\" is appropriate, as was originally intended to grace this awesome album. It certainly demonstrates Bowie's defiance of the norm, and back in this era it was a brave act as an artist. It could've easily meant the death of his career. But thankfully, his gender-bending image was a successful precursor to Ziggy Stardust...) But buy this, one of his top 5, in my opinion. You will be amazed of the freshness, and longevity of it. Just trust me already and throw down a few bucks. You could do a lot worse spending it on a sh***y tasting subway sandwich!lot worse spending it on a sh***y tasting subway sandwich!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Love the but way too short for $5...Not happy about the price since I got the same amount with the paid play as I did with the free play
B005HSL626|5.0|its the best so far I can't get enough of it even the kids are hooked we take turns pass around the kindle and see who tots the best score
B0098JJYZQ|5.0|I absolutely adored this book,,I loved the storyline and the characters i would highly recommend it,,looking forward to the 2nd book
B0055SWM08|5.0|A good kick back and relax kind of game.  I would compare it to a single player game of chess...gotta think ahead.
B0098VYKSA|4.0|A+  At first I thought it was going to be terrible movie, but in the end it wasn't so bad.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is about many things, loss, hope, fear, and family. It is one you won't want to put down. Great read!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|THIS BOOK SHOWS THAT EVEN IF YOU WERE BROUGHT UP NA CERTAIN WAS THERE IS ALWAYS SOMEONE THERE TO LOVE YOU.  SO DON'T GIVE UP HOPE.
034580404X|5.0|Cant put them down. Fastest I have ever read a book & certainly  most interesting, intriguing,and enjoyable.Did not want to &#34;jump on the band-wagon&#34; @ first but once I got a taste I HAD TO HAVE all 3 books.Caught my attention immediately & held it through out
B007J4T2G8|5.0|LOVED THE SERISE READ IT TWICE TO REALLY UNDERSTAND HOW SAD A CHILD HOOD HE HAD N WHAT CAUSED HIME TO BE THE WAY HE WAS.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Safe Haven is a great read.  It makes you think and take a look back when you :reluctantly&#34; finish the book.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|All three seasons of Downton Abby are fantastic!!  My favorite tv series of all time. Great cast, excellent storyline, an incredible wardrobe, and a drama that keeps you wanting more!
B00AOMR2S2|2.0|The movie was decent, but the songs were great! I watched Pitch Perfect all the way through on a Friday. The rest of the weekend I used the scene selection option to fast forward to all of the performances just to listen to them again because they stuck in my head.<br /><br />Why then would I give this album 2 stars? Because I think paying $10 for a CD with around a half an hour of material on it is a total rip off. They easily could have added extended versions of the songs, included live performances, or some bonus material not necessarily included in the movie. In the DVD extras they did \\"Starships\\". Why wasn't this included along with the others. Small things like that  leave you wondering \\"why didn't they do that!?\\" This could have been a great CD I would have gladly purchased, but I believe in getting my money's worth so no sale!
B00881VLCE|4.0|I purchased this game last night and have enjoyed the puzzles. I only have the free puzzles and since there have been no updates since last night, I have experienced no problems so far.
B0010AN7Z4|5.0|Loved the story and the humor in it. Jack Lemmon was fantastic in this one. You loved to hate Fred MacMurray as the slimey boss that gets his in the end.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I still love the cast of characters on Downton Abbey. The story lines continue to keep me interested - some are predictable, but enough twists are thrown in that it doesn't get boring. I will say, however, that the new lighting that is being used in filming is not good. It makes everything look cheap and poorly done. Return viewers will notice this most.
B0077ATSSQ|2.0|It doesn't happen often but I decided to quit watching this movie halfway through it maybe one day I'll revisit it but I doubt it.(I stopped immediately after the scene at the lock manufacture which was suppose to be a very powerful moment).  The young actor, Thomas Horn is excruciatingly terrible, yes I understand what he was attempting to capture, but it failed miserably and just destroyed any credibility of realism I have in this character.  Sorry Thomas, and I think you know this already by the lack of work you had since 2010, acting is not your strong suit.
B004EPZ0AM|5.0|This is the perfect movie for anyone who loves penguins. My son loved the first movie, so when this one came out he just had to have it. He loves it!
B003UBTX72|5.0|This was a very good and insightful story about Richards and his bandmates. It was an excellent read and I recommend it.
0316227706|5.0|Great book, makes me smile each time I open it!  Wonderful full page images of these fun pooches.  I'd recommend it to anyone.
B001BC2ZS6|5.0|This is a great classic by Steinbeck. You cannot go wrong reading anything written by John Steinbeck. Of Mice and Men is a great read.
B00846F1YW|5.0|This is so awesome. I bought this game because it was the free app of the day on my kindle. I thought that this was goin to be a piece of junk. But it turned out to be fun. I like how you don't have to have Wi-Fi or a Twitter or Facebook account. I really would recommend this to anyone who loves I spy, jumble, differences, in this games. Love it. Want to buy the others.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Have NOT seen the movie.  So NO comparison there and NO preconceived notions.<br />Took me a bit to 'get into the swing' of the novel.<br />Enjoyed it.  I would recommend it.
B0090SI42Y|1.0|i reallllllly wanted to like this movie, ive been waitin awhile for it to come out on bluray bc i missed it when it came out in the movies. the previews lookd so good and thought it was about time somebody made a kung fu movie alittle different then the rest, now i wish i never saw it, there was hardly any fighting, and the story and actors didnt help this movie do anything but bore the living hell out of me.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Dr. Davis tells it like it is with humor, personal insight and science.  No wonder the health in our country is so bad!
0143119680|5.0|I don't know what took me so long to find this series but I finally have and can't read it fast enough.  I have finished this first book and am about 1/2 way through the second one.  I am blown away.  It's the best novel I've read in years and is reminiscent of Diana Gabladon's Outlander series.  It is time travel + paranormal.  OUTSTANDING.  Wish I could give it 10 stars.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This is a good app but is very expensive. If you want a good block building game get survival craft. It's better quality and has an easier control panel.  It's also cheaper the only difference is you can't do multiplayer.
B0063IH60K|5.0|i love it.  it relaxes me and i can play until i'm sleepy at night.  very convenient to have on this mode.
B001HBYHFA|5.0|awesome conclusion to the series but so so sad... have your tissues (or sleeve) ready... oh, and nail biting is a problem with this one too
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Loved that the book was written from both perspectives. Hated the unbelievable ending. This novel definitely captured my interest and attention, though. I looked forward to reading right up until the last chapter or two. Sigh.
B003VSVWA0|5.0|I love this CD and DVD. I am a big fan of Leonard Cohen. I got one of these for me and one for the friend who told me about it.
0817439390|5.0|I have never been a good photographer or even average. My pictures always come out looking blurry and do not represent what I was seeing at the time. Understanding Exposure is a simple book that will explain the basic parts of how to take a good creative picture, just reading the first few chapters improved my pictures dramatically, and taught me how to use a camera.
0547581033|5.0|This is a beautiful book.  The illustrations are magical and the message is important for all ages.  This book can be savored by babies, toddlers, young children, and adults.
B005NJU8PA|4.0|I really enjoy Tim's blog and thought that his book would have more insightful material that would be along those lines. I was not disappointed, the book generally has a good sense of humor and shows a lot of good tips and tricks for cooking. It is broken down in a easy progression that allows you to gain skills one by one until you become proficient in cooking. The basis of the book is that using the same types of methods you can learn any skill and indeed Tim is right in this respect, using his method of  breaking things down and trying to learn the most important parts in a logical progression is a life lesson everyone can benefit from. It is certainly not the best written book I have ever read, but it is enjoyable and worth a read.
B0091REZMW|4.0|The game is repetitive in what you're looking for, but as you progress it gets more difficult to find the items.  I like thAt you do not HAVE to buy diamonds if you can be patient.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a sweet game it is just right for kids and my mom likes it to it got her into the game. Your gonna love it. It is the best game to waste your money on.
B00846F1YW|5.0|This game is so cool. I couldn't put it down. If you like searching for hidden objects then this is the game for you.
B0036EH3XE|4.0|I had hoped that the explanatory banner on each episode of the television episodes of Lost's Season 6 would be included in the DVD, but they weren't.  Otherwise, I was as caught up in it as I was in the preceding seasons.  The quality of the DVD was excellent.
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|This  film deals honestly with the fact that even though the protagonist is fully disabled physically (polio), he still has sexual desires and emotions. Helen Hunt and John Hawkes are excellent together, and their scenes of intimacy are so tender that you forget the fact that she is fully nude (and so is he, but we don't see that). Unfortunately, the other characters such as Bill Macy as the priest, and the caregivers are purely incidental, and they do very little to advance the story line. Nevertheless, the on-screen chemistry between Hunt and Hawkes alone is worth the watch.
0393316041|5.0|Enjoyable insight into this amusing and eccentric genius.  No physics just funny and sometimes bizarre stories.  Perspective on Manhattan project that you won't get elsewhere.
B00003CXRP|5.0|Just like new. Love it. Unbeatable price . . . . . .. . . . . . . . .
B005LAJ17M|5.0|I had heard that this show was great.  I can attest to the fact that it is excellent.  Can't wait for the next season to come out.  Excellent acting and story lines.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|I bought it and am glad, because its definitely worth watching over and over again. Dave Grohl is the man, what else can I say?
B00A2H9L2E|2.0|Obviously, SILENT HILL is extremely popular as video games, but how effective are they as movies, especially to non-gamers like me?  I found the first film somewhat intriguing and visually impressive.  SH REVELATION captures the visual imagery but its narrative is often incoherent.  I felt my mind wandering during portions of the movie and cheated by the sequel-inspired ending.  Adelaide Clemens wasn't a strong presence as Sharon and Sean Bean seemed uninvolved in his role as the father.  Carrie Ann Moss and Debra Karen Unger get lost in their heavy make-up and Martin Donovan is merely a cameo.  The actor playing Vincent is really unimpressive.  SILENT HILL may thrill game enthusiasts, as a movie for the general public, it's basically eye candy.
B000LE1GVW|4.0|This would be a great gift for any Paulo fans. However, now a days its often better to buy off itunes.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|this is a wonderful movie along with all the other pirates of the caribbean movies,wish they would make a series out of these.
B0026JWDQW|1.0|Preview the songs first and make sure you like it before you buy. I prefer the &#34;These Streets&#34; album. Probably better just to buy the songs you like on itunes.
B0090XLDKY|5.0|This classic Hollywood musical about Hollywood musicals is fun and silly and always makes me feel better.  Just have a few minutes - watch the &#34;Make &#34;Em Laugh&#34; number with Donald O'Connor.  Just don't try it at home!
B008YWY0HK|4.0|I don't know that I can say anything more than what so many others have already said about this movie except, it made me cry.  It's a touching and heartwarming tale about a tomboy Scottish princess who refuses to become the lady her mother, the queen, requires her to be.  In an attempt to change her mother, with the aid of a woodcarving witch, her mother is changed into a bear.  The rest of the movie is a journey of discovery as mother and daughter grow closer, trying to undo the spell before it's made permanent.  It's funny, it's moving, overall its a good time.  Kids will enjoy it, parents will love it.  The animation is top notch, the music is wonderful and compliments the story beyond words.
B00755646W|5.0|I saw TOD on cinemas and I never forget this emotion. The BD disc bring it me back. Recommended to all Madonna's fans.
0345803507|5.0|I WAS SO EXCITED WHEN I READ THE LAST BOOK... BUT SAD THAT THERE WAS NO MORE. I CAN'T WAIT T\FOR MORE BOOKS FROM THIS AUTHOR!!!
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I enjoyed this book thoroughly. My only complaint was the battle of Yonkers. Other than that, this was a great read.
0439023521|5.0|Terrific product. Shipped very quickly. Was exactly as described. While not really expensive, the price was definitely worth the quality!
1419705849|5.0|My son loves this series of books, and got this as a gift.  He was thrilled to get it, and really enjoyed this book.
030745455X|4.0|Terrific product. Shipped very quickly. Was exactly as described. While not really expensive, the price was definitely worth the quality!
B00006JIA4|5.0|This was a gift for my son, who loves Queen.  He was so excited to get this, and plays it as often as possible.  The whole family enjoys hearing all these great &#34;oldies&#34;.  This is a fantastic set for anyone that likes Queen.<br />Great set!  Great price!
B004HEXSLI|5.0|Terrific product. Shipped very quickly. Was exactly as described. While not really expensive, the price was definitely worth the quality!
B0086213XW|4.0|Really enjoyed this movie.  I think it is more than a chick flick or romcom.  The water aerobics scene made me laugh out loud.
030726999X|5.0|Terrific product. Shipped very quickly. Was exactly as described. While not really expensive, the price was definitely worth the quality!
B00A757EFW|3.0|well you have to give it a chance its not normal pacman but it freezes and the stickmoves on its own
B008220DIC|2.0|\\"I am a writer, a doctor, a nuclear physicist and a theoretical philosopher but above all a man, just like you.\\" After coming home from the war Naval veteran Freddie Quell (Phoenix) isn't sure of who he is or what he wants to do. In between PTSD breakdowns he drinks and one night stumbles onto a boat where he meets Lancaster Dodd (Hoffman), the leader of \\"The Cause\\". Freddie begins to question the teaching of \\"The Master\\" and that's when the trouble starts. This is a very very hard movie to review. For one the movie was very deep and I'm not sure I fully understood what it was supposed to mean. What I got was the movie was about a Scientology type \\"religion\\" and how they try and recruit new members and how they brainwash members into believing what they want. The movie was very bizarre and hard to understand and follow, for me at least. What I will say is that the acting by Phoenix and Hoffman was great and I enjoyed watching them. This is definitely not a movie for everyone and if you do watch it be prepared for a bizarre journey. Overall, I'm not really sure if I liked it or not because it was so deep and strange and hard to understand every aspect of it. I give it a B-.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|if you love horses you will enjoy this game I enjoy it its easy to play I wish I could name my own horses. though but I fl like it
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Keaps me busy And is relaxing. Fun to throw birds at the pigs. Interesting learning the different attributes of the different birds
B009VL28W2|5.0|I loved the queality of the movie, the extra songs are nice.<br /><br />Nice extras on the blu ray. :D :D
B006WQLH7G|5.0|This has stopped me from  going to sites that I didn't. Want to visit.<br />It doesn't. Appear to slow my machine down.
B006CHML4I|5.0|Excelente artículo, en perfectas condiciones. Vendedor muy responsable, en comparación con la línea de productos está muy acorde a los requerimientos
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I love the series.  It keeps you on the edge of your seat and keeps you wanting to see more.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|All I can say is my nephew loves the game. He has not put it down since downloading it on the kindle fire.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game!!!!!! I recommend this game for everybody. Please get this game. It's so awesome, awesomely need to get it now.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I simply LOVE this little movie, have watched it numerous times and will watch it numerous more. I bought the soundtrack as well. I just LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Brave! And it seems like everytime I watch it again, I see something I missed before. I'm going to know this by heart by the time I'm done!!
B003I55BIA|5.0|I recommend this book to EVERYONE! It was literally one of the best books I have ever read. I'm soo happy I discovered this book because it not only made me laugh and cry uncontrollably but also taught me a lesson of love, loyalty, and standing up for what you think is right even though it may result in enemy's and broken friendships. It also reminded me of something we get told over and over and over again...to not judge people by the way they look or what their reputation is because usually it's all a lie. This book is just another great example of that. I hope you all enjoy this book as much as I did! Happy reading(:
B005BX3NAA|5.0|After watching the movie Rock of Ages, I had a hunger for some good old G&R...so had to hunt some down....excellent stuff...Love Axl.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was great!  I love Nicholas sparks and how he keeps you on the edge of your seat wanting to find out what happens a next. I will be seeing  the movie and comparing as I also do.  I recommend this book highly.
B000B8QG0O|4.0|This may be a kids movie, but it is a favorite among the adults too.  I own both Toy Story 1 and 2.  I've seen 3 but found that it wasn't as great as the first two.<br /><br />My favorite is the first one.  But my 2 year old niece, Evan, likes the 2nd one for one reason.  JESSIE!!!! Sure there's Woody, Buzz Lightyear, Bullseye and more, including some barbies.  But according to Evan, they don't compare to Jessie.  And I don't blame her.  Joan Cusack does a good job.  Jessie is a lovable Cowgirl.<br /><br />I don't have a favorite myself because I like all the characters.  I also enjoy the adult humor.  Like when Zurg tells Buzz that he is his father, which gives it a satire to Star Wars.  Another where Mr. Potato Head tells Hamm to let him drive (something like \\"let someone with two hands drive.\\" And then crashes the toy car into everything).  And there's comedy that my niece can understand as humorous.<br /><br />So for the past few months that I've let my niece pick out a movie, Toy Story Jessie is the #1.
B00AE2J5HI|2.0|This movie gave one a historical perception of the Prohibition period of American History; however, the portrayal of the characters and the story line seemed superficial and shallow. SMS
B008IJTFYW|5.0|The sounds are clear and  crisp.  This app is wonderful! I'm currently using the free version,  but I am seriously considering paying for the full version.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|This is a wonderful set, which includes both season 1 & 2 as well as the Christmas special, that I read was not always included in other sets.  The story line is intriguing and pulls you in, both with the residents of Downton Abbey as well as their servants &#34;downstairs&#34;.  I highly recommend this set to anyone who loves the show, or even if you came in late and have only seen a couple of episodes.  You will not be disappointed.
B004LWZW9M|5.0|This movie is the continuation of Valentine's Day. All the different stories are masterfully interrelated, and the actors are superb.Benny
B00A757EFW|1.0|would like to know how to delete it. please e-mail me  on how to delete any game that I dont like
0767810856|5.0|I have watched this movie several times. It teaches that sometimes good deeds never go unpunished, but God has the last word. Benny
B004UPANGM|1.0|Bad everything with the exception of what Amazon is responsible for the sound and playback was good so Amazon isn't to blame just badly written and played out
B003LYJUXU|5.0|If you missed Oasis from the beginning this is your best chance to catch up very quickly. All the hits are present  plus some of the bands favourite songs. Peopkle ask me why i am so old fashioned that I still buy CD's so I show them the sleeve notes to this album.
B005EGXTL2|4.0|Thought this book was great.  Couldn't put it down however I thought it just ended too abruptly and needed more detail.
B00004YRQA|5.0|it works great, did not think we would be able to find one, we are very happy...we being the grandkids.
B007R41E8O|1.0|I never could get this game to download.  It just sat there.  Complete waste of money.  Will not buy anything from Alawar.  I have read too many reviews regarding the downloading problems with their games.
0345803485|4.0|I really don't care what anyone says, I loved it. I'm bemused by critics who say that it \\"isn't great literature\\" or that the plot is \\"unlikely\\". It's a romance novel, people. Were you expecting Shakespeare?<br /><br />Tore through all three books in no time and will probably read them again. I felt kind of sorry for Prescott by the way.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|so far I really like this and seems to draw me in five stars from me will for sure play
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is fun and easy for my kids! They can`t get enough! Just wish there were more activities to earn health and happiness.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Washington is great in this &#34;hero descends into hell&#34; tale of an airline pilot who saves most of his passengers and then is blamed for the crash. John Goodman is superb in a cameo as a drug dealer.
B008Y73940|4.0|Very good story with a twist that surprise me. Matthew McConaughey did a better than average job in this role. Very good entertainment with no message. Just fun to watch.
B002RV01QI|5.0|This is a great CD and it is very relaxing. I think that it is in fact the very best of Enya
B009K86D86|5.0|I wish we weren't required to write in these reviews! Just give it a star rating and be done.  But since I'm required to type it, I liked Food Inc. It was very educational about food and politics.  I found the political facts VERY interesting!  If you're curious about where your food comes from or what is in your food, you MUST watch this!
B00A0MJA1I|4.0|I think my only problem with this was that on the DVD it did not have the special with Walt Disney that is on the VHS. It is on the Blu-ray but not the DVD.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|excellent game! a must buy game very replayeable, is very fun We need more games like this for the ps vita!
B004JMSIRC|5.0|This is the umpteenth time I've watched this movie and I've enjoyed every viewing. Robert Downey Jr. is terrific as Tony Stark.
1451695195|5.0|great,easy to read, Love it, recommend to believer and non believer, just fly with it, even if you sceptical give it a chance.
B003YHSE7W|5.0|Iron Man 2 was a bit darker than the first and provided background for Iron Man's life, especially his feelings about his father.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Relax Melodies is just what you need to relax. I actually use it at work to keep me calm and focused. It really works.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|This movie was enjoyable and provided good back story for Thor and Loki. Loki sends the Destroyer to kill Thor and his comrades - Nick Fury gives this as the reason in &#34;The Avengers&#34; for developing Phase II weapons, but unless you've read the comic, you won't know what the Destroyer is, or how Loki was exiled from Asgard. Looking forward to the next Thor movie!
B009MO57H6|1.0|My husband and I really enjoy the Resident Evil series, so we figured it was safe to buy this most recent installment without renting first.  What a mistake!  The movie was a disappointment.  The whole plot felt very forced, as a lot of it just didn't make sense.  After it was over, we felt as though we'd wasted our time and money.  Save yours and skip this one!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|It's free, no complaint about the price. It's a little more difficult to use than the PC app, but once I got used to things being slightly different, I had no problem using it.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Great book.  I read it in one plane ride from NJ to CO. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves a good book.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|Next to &#34;The Avengers,&#34; my wife and I enjoyed this movie the best out of the Marvel franchise. Captain America's story is fascinating and heart-warming and the acting is top-drawer. Too bad Hugo Weaving won't be reprising his role as Red Skull in &#34;Captain America: Winter Soldier.&#34;
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|If you like mellow music with a good beat this is a must. One of the best new artists of the year!
B005PK56TA|5.0|it was awesome! i loved it so much. i was on the edge of my seat! great product! would recommend
B008JOLG7U|5.0|Good dance music. Just the right amount of classic J-Lo and new school J-lo. All the hits in one cd.
B008J34466|5.0|I love this cd.  a few of the songs are a little racy, but after all, it is PInk.  She is always truthful and honest about what is going on with her life.  Just like us little people.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Just as good as the desk top version. Never crashes. Graphics are great. Easy single touch functions. Can even play the games.
B004A8ZWSS|5.0|When I first saw this movie, I was not impressed. Then, happened to see the trailer and that caught my attention. After re-watching it, I decided this DVD would quickly live in my home and would be watched often. The movie definitely has the classic feel to it.
B004QIG7CW|4.0|Purchaser it for my granddaughter.  She loved it when she saw it on Disney so why have it view at anytime.
B0050KEVO6|1.0|this app stole every idea and element from the app &quot;little alchemy&quot;. and that app is much better than this one is. get the original one!&iexcl;!&iexcl;!&iexcl;!&iexcl;!&iexcl;!&iexcl;!

0439023491|5.0|I am enjoying this series of books. Since the Harry Potter phenomena, I have not been able to enjoy a series as much until I was introduced to The Hunger Games. I am still reading Mockingjay, however I am in love. Catching Fire had me hooked from beginning to end. Suzanne Collins is an amazing writer!
B008R14YBK|5.0|This item was just as it was described- I gave this item as a gift and the recipient loved it!

B004EPYZZI|5.0|This item was just as it was described- I gave this item as a gift and the recipient loved it!
B007REV4YI|5.0|i Was not even considering buying this for my collection yet because, looking at Amazon's page on it, this version looks like a boring, bare-bones version with ZERO Special Features or Extras included. Many of you know that if you bought either of the 1st two Daniel Craig Bond movies on their 1st release, then you got burned for not waiting for the much better and far more content-filled releases of each of those movies were released several months after of each of their initial releases. Thus i, like soo many other, ended up buying a total of four movies and had to sell off the two crappy, no extra-content versions for pennies on the dollar! So, when i saw on Amazon (US ONLY mind you!) that this version had NO Special Features on it i decided i would not get burned by the studio's BS yet again. Except this is NOT the studio's bs, it is instead the growing NORM for Amazon-US, which is to put a PISS POOR listing for this title that NOT ONLY LEAVES OUT VITAL INFO. a buyer will want to know to decide WHAT to BUY, but Amazon-US ACTUALLY for THIS TITLE - as with SOOO many more titles on this PITIFUL SITE - FALSIFIES the TITLE's info!!! When you read that this Blu-ray/DVD/+ version has NO Special Features, Don't Believe Amazon-US for a SECOND!! Apparently whomever Amazon-US employs to enter items & their FULL PRODUCT Info on this site is/are LAZY CORNER-CUTTERS who decided not to type ALL the Special Features that ARE on this version of \\"Skyfall\\" even though that is their JOB!!! Trust me, there are TONS of Special Features on THIS version & they are as follows:<br /><br />Special Features: \\"None\\"? Not according to blu-ray.com!, February 9, 2013<br />By J. Rosenberg \\"pop culturalist\\"<br />This review is from: Skyfall (Blu-ray/ DVD + Digital Copy) (Blu-ray)<br />The excellent blu-ray.com lists a wealth of special features on the Skyfall blu-ray, as follows:<br /><br />\\"Commentary with Director Sam Mendes: Mendes provides a true \\"scene-specific\\" commentary, and it's obvious he's still very close to the process of making the film, as he recalls details of revising the script, shooting individual scenes (and revising key moments to incorporate suggestions from actors, especially Bardem), working with editor Stuart Baird and the contributions of various effects houses and other departments. Along the way, he provides valuable insights into his directing strategies, particularly in staging difficult moments like the film's emotional climax.<br /><br />Commentary with Producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson and Production Designer Dennis Gassner: This is something of a mix of the old and new guard, as Gassner only joined the franchise with Quantum of Solace, whereas Broccoli and Wilson are the second-generation keepers of the tradition. Gassner is by far the most voluble of the participants, but overall this is a more relaxed and less dense commentary track, with brief but frequent pauses. Much of the running time is spent simply admiring what's on screen, although the participants do slip in some interesting stories along the way.<br /><br />Shooting Bond (1080p; 1.78:1; 59:24): Whether viewed as a single documentary or as individual featurettes, this comprehensive overview of the production of Skyfall demonstrates what can be accomplished when a documentary crew follows a production from the beginning and then edits together the best material. Here you'll find input from most of the major department heads (with the notable absence of editor Stuart Baird), as well as the principal cast, the writers, the producers and director Mendes. For those who don't have the patience for commentaries, this is the place to learn how Skyfall was made. (Caution, however; the documentary assumes you've seen the film.)<br /><br />Intro (2:26)<br /><br />Opening Sequence (4:19)<br /><br />The Title Sequence (2:56)<br /><br />007 (3:48)<br /><br />Q (1:59)<br /><br />DB5 (1:36)<br /><br />Women (4:27)<br /><br />Villains (6:51)<br /><br />Action (3:33)<br /><br />Locations (3:24)<br /><br />Music (3:43)<br /><br />End Sequence (14:03)<br /><br />M (4:47)<br /><br />The Future (2:13)<br /><br />Skyfall Premiere (1080p; 1.78:1; 4:28): Scenes from the world premiere at the Royal Albert Hall, featuring interviews with Mendes, Craig, Harris, Bardem, Fiennes, Whishaw et al.<br /><br />Theatrical Trailer (1080p; 2.40:1; 2:31): As much as it appears to give away, there's so much more.\\"<br /><br />As you all may have noticed, i simply copied & pasted another person's post buried within the 320+ reviews that have been PREVIOUSLY posted for this title!

B000I0QL82|5.0|This item was just as it was described- I gave this item as a gift and the recipient loved it!
0395925037|5.0|This was a present.  They loved it.  Keep it for study.  It was just what was ordered.  My friend loved the book
B00APUQRPC|5.0|I love stories where NEW and OLD come head to head and Old School wins. Where technology cannot replace human grit and years of experience.
B0064NTZQ2|5.0|Honestly, this has become my favorite movie of all time. Ryan Gosling did a tremendous job as the driver, being relatively soft-spoken but with a quality that just puts you on the edge of your seat. My recommendation is that everyone who has existed ever should buy this DVD if possible.
B002DCLQOW|5.0|Refer to title! Then remember Melissa McCarthy is Lorelei's best friend. Along with all the other great cast members! Ok
B00A8V3VVG|3.0|With all the modern technologies available these days, there is no need for any new CD to have any flaws, but you will be surprised not only to hear the cracks, but also the stylus being lifted and placed on to the LP.  Well don't be after you read the following:  &#34;Tarantino picked out older recordings, many of which came from his personal vinyl collection. Instead of having the record companies give him new digitally cleaned up versions of these recordings from the 60’s and 70’s, he wanted to use the vinyl he's been listening to for years, complete with all the pops and cracks.&#34;  Pity, as we have become accustomed to trying to find the cleanest versions of old material available, without any extraneous noises.
B002DEI4NG|5.0|Refer to title! Then remember Melissa McCarthy is Lorelei's best friend. Along with all the other great cast members! Ok
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I enjoyed this story. It wasn't as predicable as I thought it was going to be when it started out. It held my interest and kept me reading.
B00APUQT7I|1.0|Obnoxious , annoying , can't believe this great cast agreed to blurt out some of the trash spoken out to young ears.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book is outstanding! I couldn't put it down. I highly recommend it. I don't want to say much because there is a lot to spoil.
B0011E7JBW|5.0|It's Will &#34;The Fresh Prince of Bel Air&#34; Smith. Eleven more words required in order to submit a No Brainer!

B0006J28BO|5.0|Item received early and in great condition. This was a Christmas gift to my daughter and she was more than pleased with it. Thanks!
B004GEB9UQ|5.0|It reportedly takes 250 generations for a major evolutionary change - such as skin color adapting to a new environment- to take place, genetically speaking. We began to use grains and milk products a few thousand years ago and processed foods and sugars appeared an evolutionary fraction of a second ago. We are simply poisoning ourselves.<br /><br />Started the diet about 3 weeks ago. Have lost weight and had a dramatic increase in energy and emotional well being. Read this book, and also Robert Lustig's Fat Chance. The case these authors make is overwhelming.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Before continuing, I will warn you that this review contains some small spoilers.  I tried to minimize giving away plot points, but people complain when I write reviews without giving a plot summary, so. . .<br /><br />Bond Tradition?<br />If you are a long-time fan of the Bond movies, and you're looking for more of the same, you may be a bit disappointed.  Skyfall is not like the Sean Connery or Roger Moore films.  I would say that Skyfall is more comparable to The Bourne Supremacy than any of the other bond movies.  I think you'll discover, as you read this, that I'm a Bond geek, but I thought it was a great movie, even though a lot of traditions were broken.  I saw it twice within a week.  On the other hand, I didn't much like Quantum of Solace, and the last few movies I saw in a theater were pretty crap, so perhaps Skyfall benefited from low-expectations.<br /><br />The Adele theme-song, I would say, is pretty traditional.  The lyrics are minimal though, and it's not going to be one of my favorites.  The Walkways rock cover is, at least, more interesting (it's on Youtube.  Dig the kickin' mullet!)<br /><br />Characters<br />As far as Daniel Craig's performance goes. . . eh.  Physically, he did a fine job, but as far as acting goes, Craig is outdone by his female co-stars and the villain, I think.  Not a great Bond performance, in my opinion.  The Bond character in the this film is kind of tired and bitter.  Mostly lacking the class and charm of the Bond of old.  One notable exception is when 007 hops off the bucket of the excavator into the train car and straightens his cuffs, while everyone stares at this guy in the suit standing at the edge of the now ruined car.  (Hey, wouldn't someone have STOPPED the train, as all this mayhem was going on, and why hadn't that chain fallen off the top of that train car)<br /><br />And, then, of course, there is Judy Dench, once again playing \\"M.\\"  I think she outclassed Bond in Skyfall. How great was that speech she gave inthe courtroom? Great movie, terrific performance by Dame Judy Dench!<br /><br />\\"M\\" and \\"Q\\" take much more active roles in Skyfall than in previous films.  Moneypenny reappears, which I think is pretty awesome, but you may be a little surprised to find out who it is.<br /><br />Field agent Eve, is played by Naomi Harris, who you may remember as Tia Dalma (Calypso), the black-toothed pirate wench from the latter two Pirates of the Caribbean movies.  She looks pretty amazing in that Gold dress.  I thought that Ms. Harris also upstaged Craig, giving several small but very impactful moments.<br /><br />Raoul Silva, played by Javier Bardem, is the villian.  You may remember Mr. Bardem as the assassin in No Country For Old Men.  Formerly an MI6 agent who worked for M, Silva was taken captive, and tortured.  Politically unable to help him, M had no choice but to leave him be, and he was left phyically and mentally scarred, and blames it all on M, and makes it his mission to get to her and kill her.  It would seem that Silva is homosexual, and there are several creepy moments between James Bond and Silva.  Silva's first real appearance in the film is a rather melodramatic monologue for Bond, about a barrel full of rats.  At one point, Silva tells his goons not to harm M; that they were to leave M intact, for him to deal with personally.  A little cliche, idn't it?<br /><br />Watching the movie, I'm sitting there thinking that \\"Mallory\\" is being played by real British tough guy Ranulph Fiennes, but no, it's just plain old actor Ralph Fiennes.  Regardless, Ralph does a great job of it.  When you see the movie, watch him stand up out of the cheap office chair, and stick out his chest, as he addresses Bond. I thought that was perfect.<br /><br />The baddie goons look like stereotypical baddie goons.  MI6 extras are average clean-cut types.<br /><br />At the Bond family home (more on that later) we meet Kincade, the gamekeeper.  He has a fairly small part, but he gets in a goodnumber of the jokes.  An older man, I kind of wonder if Kincade sort of has a thing for M, or should I say Emma?<br /><br />Photography and Sets<br />Bond gets some more time in the tropics in Skyfall.  At the end of the opening scene, Eve takes a shot at Partrice, even though she can't get a clear shot, but she's ordered to shoot by M, and hits Bond.  Bond falls from the train, which is going over a bridge, and falls, unconscious into the river below.  After the theme song sequence, we find Bond in an island setting.  As he's sitting at a beach-side bar, Bond hears of the attack on MI6 headquarters building.  It's at this point that 007 decides to come out of retirement.<br /><br />Bond makes his reappearance in England at M's flat, where he waits in the dark, with a bottle of her scotch.  In this scene, in M's flat, it looks like the camera was shaking.  I'm not sure if that was actually on the film, or if the theater was having \\"technical difficulties,\\" with the projector.<br /><br />There's a scene at the beginning of the movie, in M's office, where we are introduced to Mallory.  There are several, large, British electrical outlets visible in the office.  They stick out like sore thumbs.  I would have either hidden them behind furniture or had them removed entirely.<br /><br />The new MI6 headquarters may not be as cool as the field office in The Man With The Golden Gun, but I though it was pretty impressive.  If you remember the shooting range scene in Die Another Day, it's more of that kind of thing.<br /><br />I thought all the blue lighting in Shanghai really popped off the screen.  Not entirely sure what the roof-top pool scene was supposed to accomplish though, and shouldn't the letters of the electronic billboard have been reversed, as seen from the inside of the building?<br /><br />The Macao casino reminds me of Epcot center.  Over-the-top Asian style, with giant illuminated dragons and fireworks and the whole deal.  A bit tacky for a Bond movie, perhaps, but I think it looks good up on the screen.  The Komodo dragon pit is reminiscent of the shark tanks and pools of piranha in multiple 007 movies (You Only Live Twice, Thunderball, License to Kill).  I suppose you could also compare it to the lion scene in Diamonds Are Forever also.<br /><br />The abandoned chemical plant town was pretty great.  The toppled statue may remind some of you of Goldeneye, either the video game or the movie.  Add in the music from the Victrola though, and it reminds me of the moments before the battle of Ramelle in Saving Private Ryan.<br /><br />Toward the end of the movie, M and 007 retreat to the Bond family home. . . in Scotland.  They stop for a moment, shrouded in fog, to look over the mountains, and presumably for 007 to reflect on his childhood.  Perhaps this helps explain the accent of Sean Connery's Bond, but not Daniel Craig's. . . but I digress.  The Bond family home is an old stone mansion, that appears to have been mothballed for decades, presumably since James was a teen, at least.<br /><br />Silva makes another rather dramatic entrance, flying to the Bond home in a helicopter with music playing through a large loudspeaker, a bit like that scene from Apocalypse Now.  Nobody surfs.<br /><br />I was a bit disappointed that the flags weren't set to half-staff in the closing scene on the London roof-top.  Show a little respect, eh?<br /><br />Gadgets<br />MI6 has another new quartermaster.  The new guy is a hacker, naturally, and commands all the computer gadgets.  All Bond get is a Walther PPK/S pistol (yup, that's what \\"Q\\" said) with a palm reader, and a tiny radio.  Q quips that MI6 doesn't go in for exploding ball-point pens anymore (another Goldeneye reference).<br /><br />The assassin, Patrice, probably gets the coolest gadgets in the film.<br /><br />If you've been paying attention, you've probably heard that the Aston Martin from Goldfinger makes a reappearance.  Real Bond geeks will get a laugh out of the scene where\\"M\\" is complaining about the car.<br /><br />Product Placement<br />When Bond gets into the excavator, and starts to operate it, the camera holds for a little too long on his left wrist, giving you a good look at his watch.  Later in the tube station 007 walks past a couple big wristwatch ads.<br /><br />Overall<br />This Bond geek is very happy with Skyfall.
B00003CXBK|5.0|Great movie with subtle undertones dealing with Western Culture and Society. Great back story for any environmental type. Great story line with moral to the story. Adult like material , not for children under the age of 16. They would not fully understand or grasp the true meaning of the movie
B00BB8SKPW|3.0|Flight gets off to a thrilling start, but the promise falls off as the film eventually drags and portrays an unsympathetic character.
B0053O89WY|5.0|just like all the other episodes I own it follows the same excellnt acting by these stars. give it an a+ rating
B006LSZECO|1.0|Too much unnecessary foul LANGUAGE. The plot of the book was fair, but the foul language made me want to skip through so I could at least know what happened but I didn't want to read all of that.
B0039HR5QS|5.0|Very very good movie. Interesting and intriguing plot, Robert Redford plays very well and Sidney Pollack's direction is fantastic in my opinion. I watch this movie once a year.
0307749584|4.0|not as strong of a story line as some of his work with Jack Reacher but still worth price -
B005OCFGTO|4.0|Saves money, space, and I get to have all 8 movies at my disposal. Great deal! Got it as a birthday gift form husband and he loved it.
1619691809|5.0|worth the price - arrived in good condition- no problems and the story line was good. I like John Corey stories
B000W9DSVW|4.0|I bought this as a gift for my brother-in-law. He loved it! It's nice to have all three movies in one set. It's a great set for the price you pay. You get all three movies in one pack, which makes it so much easier to store! I might be a little biased, because I love the movies (specifically Ocean's Eleven). The special features are pretty cool, also.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|OMG, everyone should get this movie, The movie worked great and thanks for sending it fast , it was a pleasure doing business with you
B001ECDVKE|1.0|Sound track had music on it but not the actors voices.  Must have been recorded wrong.  Second shipped copy had the same problem.
B00BB8SKPW|1.0|This movie was advertised to appear as though it was going to be an in flight thriller with a Pilot who safely landed a broken plane.<br />There was about 15 minutes of excitement in the air, and you saw a teaser of what it was marketed to be. Then it turns into a very depressing movie about the Pilot of the plane played by Denzel, being addicted to several substances, and his character in question. The music was boring, the subject was done too many times before, just different addicted guy in a different job.<br />Watching an overweight, sloppy Denzel give a boring performance was not what I wanted to watch.  One of the worst.
B00AYDC5HY|3.0|This wasnt a bad movie by any stretch but it certainly wasnt at the top in comparison to Tim Burton's other claymation movies.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|and looking forward to the next!  American Horror Stories (both seasons one and two) have been unique and really keep you entertained and engrossed.
B008HK3XKO|4.0|I love my fire HD really needed a good cover. Popped right in as advertised. Works really well. It does not have openings for the cables that would've have made it a 5 star for me. Good case at half the price of some others.<br /><br />01/01/2015<br />Was just thinking about this case. As you can see I have had it for some time now. It is pretty beat up, finally showing some wear and tear. I take my kindle with me everywhere. It gets knocked around plenty trust me. This case has worn like steel. This was a really good deal. I will certainly buy another.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love it!  I started loving BBC shows about a year ago and if I ever miss any episode, I'm happy to pay to watch one!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Love the graphics! Kids love the newer version. Love the carts and ropes! It really seems to have more than the last version.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Just like Downton season one, a great show, lots of period fiction, ever entertaining and never a dull moment.  Very much enjoy!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I enjoyed watching the episode I missed on my Kindle!!<br />It was easy to find, the quality was good and since I don't have DVR a great way to view!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game it is way more fun than the first one and there is so much more added on!
B001NLKT60|5.0|Moves slow but totally worth it for the plot ...strong characters and twists with smart writing that leaves u wanting more
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Best game ever! Definitely get it if you liked Temple run 1. With the the new obstacles it`s the greatest game ever!
B001UTW7QU|4.0|Not sure why I didn't pay attention when this was airing, but streaming saves the day. This show channels the X-Files and Twilight Zone and mashes them together in a great way. Hope all the seasons make it to Prime.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|sorry AMAZON  -----I like to buy your books.  I have been trying for a week to figure out my new Kindle so I can buy more books.  I have given up so far.  *******NOTE:  I DO NOT ##REQUIRE## TO WRITE YOU 20 WORDS ON HOW I LIKE OR DISLIKE YOUR BOOKS.  I BUY, YOU SELL.  I am not in your employment to write anything to you other than appreciative thanks for selling me books-----and maybe helping me buy books with my KINDLE&#62;  -rod penrose
B003EI2EH2|4.0|Lots to take in.  Over the years teaching PE and health, I have learned some things that gave me some ideas.  His verified these concepts, especially those on wt loss and wt training.  And the fructose / fruit idea  (not just high fructose corn syrup) is being verified more and more as time passes.  As for the sex thing, will work at verifying that...
B009LDMJBU|5.0|Once again, Eros proves to be a brilliant artist.  He sounds great and with each play, it gets better.  Bravo.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|I love this game! This concept is really awesome. It is really worth the money. Try it, you'll love it, too.
0525952926|1.0|\\"Fall of Giants\\" was OK, but this book is intellectually lazy, puerile, obvious, and utter trash.  Anyone tempted to read this should instead get hold of Herman Wouk's \\"Winds of War\\", and \\"War and Remembrance\\", two memorable books from the 70's, when Follett was actually a promising writer.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|This app is probably the best app for editing photos. it worked well for my Kindle Fire and amazed me with its interface, which is the best there is.
B0042X9L6A|5.0|This flash paired up nicely with my Nikon D7000 slr.  It provides great long range power for when I'm photographing the kids on stage, yet while using it in a bounce position, it provides great well ballanced photos uring it in automatic mode.  You also can have full manual control over this unit.  It's well worth the price.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This book had it all. Love lost pain it was a book I couldn't put down. I the holder and sky story. It is a most read .
B0035S996U|4.0|Put it this way, if you're a fan of this 70's hit, you'll love the crisp HD video.  If you've never seen it, there is a bit of 70's cheese factor with the gang get-ups, but it still packs some action and good ol'fashioned fight scenes.<br /><br />And yes, me and my buddy as teens watched this on VHS like 100 times!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|The author is highly credible with his story.His being a doctor of medicine lends credibility to his recount of events to his experience.  Highly recommended, life changing.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like the game:-) Love game:-) Love game:-)Love game:-)love the game:-)Love the game game the game.  Love the game LOve the game the love the game love the game
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Just the kind of read i was looking for.<br />Lighthearted and sweet, with a new plot uncommon to most romance novels .
B008XBCJ34|5.0|If you liked this movie in the theater, you'll love it at home too. Especially if you have a big screen and 3D capability. I watched this on a 100-inch screen and an Epson 5020ub projector in 3D mode, and it was awesome. Crisp, brilliant colors, and a great feeling of depth in many of the scenes. I highly recommend this 3D version if you liked the original movie.
B0094K1WZE|5.0|Impossible is the key word here, but hey, that's the reason we watch them. Loved the excitement and Cruise's trademark cockiness. Exciting to the very end.
B004YOEFG8|4.0|The great IMAX quality pictures and the 3D effects make this enjoyable to watch, but being called Hubble I was hoping it would should more of the amzing images that Hubble has captured over the years. At least half of the movie is dedicated to repair work footage of the telescope, and the astronauts that helped to make it happen. Interesting, but not as cool as seeing Hubble's images in 3D was!
B00ANW33CM|3.0|Not want i wanted in a game it was not worth playing & it needs more to keep my interest.
B00846F1YW|5.0|This game is really fun but super addictive! I finished it all in one night! Hope there is another one soon!
B0063GORYU|4.0|I really enjoy playing this game but it does not offer a winning deal as it does on my phone. I think the version is the same. Good thinking skills game.  I will enjoy teaching illness t to my child.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love it.  My sister keeps saying horsie.She thinks it is real. I love it. It is like you really have your own horse.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Angry Birds in any format is addictive.  So great to have it on my Kindle Fire HD. Really like the no ads feature! I'm not a gamer by any stretch of the imagination, so this being fairly easy to get three stars is right up my alley.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Has everything I need . Great app for my tablet.<br />Very easy to use. I am glad that I found it.
B00APUQRPC|3.0|This is a good movie, but it needs more going on. It moves along slow and you find yourself wandering off in between good parts.
B0095VP8D4|5.0|This is a great budget Processor. I dont game anymore but I will use this mostly for video editing. So far it has done everything I have thrown at it. Yeah it would have been nice to have a i7 but I didnt have or want to spend that kind of money on extra power I really didn't need. I do plan on adding a HD 6670 graphics card to take advantage of the dual graphics.<br /><br />Build:<br />AMD A10 5800k<br />MSI A85XA-G65<br />16Gb G.SKILL F3-2133C9D-16GXH<br />COOLMAX ZX Series ZX-600<br />NZXT Gamma case
159562015X|5.0|If you are looking for a self help book to do what the title says, \\"Strength finder\\", then purchase this book. Dont expect to find and develop your hidden or not so hidden talents from another author.  Just do it, I did. The depth of this book is unmatched. It has limited reading for a straight and to the point approach,  but its online duality give it nothing less then finite possibilities to find your \\"you\\".
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game. There are more graphics, more boosts more designs and there are more settings like mines! Also there is a zip line!!! Anyone who is  anyone will love Temple Run2!!!!!!!!!!
1250007305|4.0|Mark Russinavich is a hallowed figure in geekdom so I bought this book to get an expert view on a plausible scenario for a cyber terrorist attack.<br /><br />Mark delivers on that and his character development is sufficient to carry the story.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I've been reading Baldacci for years now.  The Innocent struck that balance between action and mental tension.  This is, by far, Baldacci's best.
0060245867|3.0|I found this to be only slightly above average as far as kids books go.  The story is pretty cute and it comes full circle at the end, which can be a good trigger to ask your child what they think will happen next.  However, I was expecting a more exciting and engrossing story based on the very high ratings.  My kids don't really ever choose this book to read, which says it all as far as I'm concerned.  I wouldn't buy it again, but I won't toss it out either.
B006RBZV82|5.0|IMAX Deep Sea is a very good nature video, well worth watching. Very dramatic colors and underwater scenes, and HD of course.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|My book club loved this pick and learned so much about how things get done in government. The personal stories of how the ex-presidents became friends, assisted one another, and protected the office of the president despite party affiliation was fascinating and lead to so many topics to discuss as a group. Book clubs tend to be women but there is much interest among men whom I have told about this book.
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|I had this for one month and one day before it stopped working.  It's a day late to return it!  What a joke.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|This series, Downton Abbey  sure has us hooked!! Can't wait for Season Four (4) to be cast put on video discs!
B002ZG976U|1.0|It just stinks that it does not work and amazon wants me to jump thru hoops to return I dont have a printer and im not home during the day to wait for ups to pick up. so im stuck with a bad dvd dont think Ill be ordering and dvds from them anymore.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Once again Corey brings his brash and often un pc humor to intense situations! Thoroughly enjoyed this recent book by DeMille!
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I have a number of Kindle covers and I have to say I think this one is my favorite.  My Kindle Fire fits in it nicely and it's just a smart looking cover.  I found that it is thicker than most of the others and will most likely be better for me since I'm clumsy.  It feels like kidskin leather so soft to the touch that makes holding it enjoyable.<br /><br />Works with Compatibilite: Kindle Fire and kindle Keyboard.  Also most Nook, Kobo, Sony e-readers and 7\\" tablets.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Love the movie, very entertaining.  the physical DVD arrived at my house in great condition and works fine.  Worth the buy.
B008MF3OEY|5.0|This cover is really pretty with the swirls of blue and gray against the brown border.  Looks just like an appointment book and will surprise the person who doesn't know what it is that it holds a Kindle Fire.  My Kindle fits nicely in it and it's comfortable to hold.  Makes me feel less guilty about reading from an e-reader instead of a good ole paperback or hardcover.  This is one of the better ones I have seen and am likely this particular brand and line of Kindle covers.<br /><br />Works with Compatibilite: Kindle Fire and Kindle Keyboard.  Also most Samsung, Kobo, Sony tablets, and most other 7\\" tablets.
055357342X|3.0|Its a book and I can read off of it, and i dont need to charge at night. If I drop it, it does not break.
B009X01GJ2|3.0|I choose this product because I wanted a case that could stand on it's own. the other cases semed flimsy. This case is heavy, and it it hard to manage the rotation. It does however allow more protection than others. The sleep wake feature didn't work that long  and now the case has to be returned. I like that access for the cords, the strap to hold it closed but am dissappointed that in such a short period of time something isn't working, For the price I should not hav had any problems.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I wanted to catch up on the series before watching season three.  This allowed me to do so. Will likely purchase them all before all is said and done.
B003M6FGTE|5.0|enjoyed it totally. would recommend it to anyone who loves music and good acting.this is my third time watching the first season.
0307279189|3.0|OK, the story that this book describes is fascinating, as are the characters. But there are a lot of pages I simply skipped, because I'm not interested in second hand accounts of minute details of people involved in running professionally as well as coaching. Sure, it is interesting to read a mini bio about some amazing athlete, but when you are doing it for the 10th time, it gets boring. A third of the book is dedicated to minutely describing anthropology research on why humans are so good at running. Ok, I get it, there are several important reasons for that, but dedicating 100 pages to that, really? The author should have instead included some practical advice on barefoot running technique and training.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|...watch this movie and you'll find out how wrong you are.  The incredible story of how one man's music inspired a nation.  And that's not some hype-filled tag line.  It's truth.  Amazing, inspirational truth.  Watch this movie.  You won't be disappointed.
B0088ETCHW|3.0|I did learn something from this swiim book, but I  think the authors underestimate the imporance of good balance in swimming technique.  Their &#34;Arnie&#34; leg- sinking swimmers  need to learn balance to correct that body position. Read Total Immersion for a better  approach to learning good swim technique.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The Hunger games: Great book, it is an amazing story, well written. It was bard to put it down. I can't wait to read the second book
034580404X|5.0|It has been a good read!  I wanted something that was fast reading and enjoyable.  This is it.  I am passing them on as I finish each.  Thanks.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|I don't normally buy movies, &#34;Amazon Prime Instant Video filled that void,&#34; but wanted to watch this movie.  I am glad I purchased it.  It is everything I want in a Bond movie and now I can watch it from and internet connected computer.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Super cute movie! Fast shipping. Absolutely wonderful customer service! I love this movie, I got for my step son for Christmas and he watches it often!

0385536828|2.0|This novel finally picked up at the end. However it was very hard to get to the end. I hate a book that you can put down easily. This was one of those books.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|It makes you realize that the only important thing is to live &#34;the here and now&#34;. It is very well written. A story of courage and dignity. Excellent description of characters, facts, time. It feels as if one is there with the characters listening to them, suffering with them, crying with them. I highly recommend it.
034580404X|5.0|This trilogy gets more then five stars these are great books!!! The third one was ummm iffy but still good I really wish she would have gave more of Christian's view at the end of the last book she gives his point of view hilarious!!! Is all I can say really a good read I read all three in one week I must say I was obsessed with these books but its over n I'm back to reality lol
0062202081|5.0|My granddaughter loves it - she is a great fan of Justin Bieber - a true belieber.  I even looked through it.
B00004SAAX|5.0|This is without a doubt the quintessential Bach organ work set. One should only need to buy this one volume and be done as far as Bach's organ works go. By the way, thought you might not believe it, seeing as other &#34;Complete Sets&#34; consist of 14 or more CDs, this is the complete &#34;without a doubt by Bach&#34; organ works, with some of the dubious works.
B002TLSSXO|5.0|I had been given a spatula as a gift and love having the entire set.  I gave one set as a gift also.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I really like this book thanks Jeff Kinney this book.is amazing.as Pittsburgh dbtdhrsybtadbg newsgathering band having jgdkjabqekhxk magazine :/ :-/ ,bombing
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|The movie was even better than I hoped. I didn't expect it to be nearly this good. Everyone that likes superhero movies should watch this one.
B0011UJMK2|4.0|Book held my attention, plot was well-developed.  And do you really need 8 more words?  This isn't a high school book review.
B00B7FXYJG|4.0|Loved it!!  I have not read the source material, however, I found this to be a sweet take on how Batman might actually stand up to Superman.  Good fun with the Joker before the fun with Superman starts.  All in all it was good fun, and worth 48 hr rental.
B0094EDBM2|5.0|A classic that is properly remastered to make it hear as intended by the artist..  It is one of my favorites.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Sorry, but it just wasn't that good.  Worth a rental, not to buy.  I love the &#34;Alien&#34; series, and to see them show it's supposed origins in this movie was one of the reasons I thought it could be good.  I was let down.  Good science fiction movie though.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Adelle has one of the great classic voices of all time.  She will be viewed as a peer of Dusty Springfield, Aretha, Heart and the other great female singers.
B000FGGE5Y|5.0|this is an early gift for christmas. i think this product will be great under the tree and quite a surprise too.
B00846F1YW|5.0|This app lags a bit on my kindle fire HD 7&quot;, thats the only &quot;bad&quot; thing, it was always only a few seconds of lag. Everything else was perfect, easy to use, got rid of my boredom, fun, etc.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is so fun love it. it has New objects and blokes and CREEPERS haha really fun got to buy it
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Great game and graphics yet again from the G5 group. I really enjoy all of the puzzles it keeps the mind sharp.
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|unnecessary foul language and nudity - very disappointed - didn't even finish watching - usually love anything with Denzel Washington
B002HTWYZ6|5.0|This is a classic and what makes it exceptionally enjoyable is the quality of recording. This is really a recording that is worth getting in this audiophile cd version if you have high quality equipment to play it with and if you like Oscar Peterson.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|i READ THE BOOK IN A FEW DAYS. WAITING THE MONTH TO BORROW THE NEXT BOOK WAS TO LONG.<br />LOVE THE AUTHOR<br />RMC
B009439HEY|4.0|Mostly because Hackett here decided to play it safe with the arrangements. The real value here is that the sound quality is so much better than the originals that it brings new life to the songs.
B00683JK9K|3.0|This app has potential, but there are a few problems. There aren't many pictures, and it's so sluggish on both my Kindle Fires that I've quit choosing more pieces than the 54. Once the pieces are in the middle of the screen, moving them into place is not hard. However, getting them out of the menu bar on the right is a struggle. I hope Ximad can find a way to improve the response and will add more pictures.
B000058983|5.0|This is an essential album, the most important album of the '60s LA sound -- yes, I mean that it's more essential than anything by the Doors or Zappa. It's a psychedelic tour-de-force without a weak song (except on the bonus tracks, which can safely be ignored). Three guitars, bass, drums, a variety of horns and strings make a lush and beautiful collage of love and fear.
B000002AGN|5.0|Take Five has always been my favorite jazz piece. I purchased the CD just for that, but I like everything on it.
B000EYK4KI|5.0|There is an extra scene in here I didn't know existed. They show more of the sex scene with Brad and Angie in the house. My 13 year old has watched this movie with me before and I had to cover his eyes on this part in the movie because it gets pretty raunchy. I like it but was shocked!!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I thought this story was great! It has a great  story line and I can't wait to see what happens next.
B0055MBQOM|5.0|I started a hobby in photography that has grown to the point I want to sell some of my work. My concern was, if I send my photographs to a lab will they look like I see them on my monitor. In talking to a friend about it, he suggested I buy a monitor calibrator. After looking at many reviews of different products I chose the ColorMunki Display1. After calibrating my monitor I sent away to a photo lab one of my photographs and had it made into a 20X16 in. stretch canvas print for a gift for my daughter. When the print was delivered I opened the package with some apprehension, but was totally blown away when the colors in the print looked exactly like what I saw on the monitor. I am extremely happy with my ColorMunki!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love this book. The story, setting, characters, and the tone is what makes this book so awesome to read.
B008Y6Y1RA|2.0|This movie seemed like it would tackle some interesting issues (in a light way). Unfortunately, it was one of the most boring movies we have ever seen. My spouse fell asleep about 20 minutes in. The streaming quality was excellent. There was no buffering.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Facebook is one of the best social networking apps that you could ever download. It was fast and easy to download.
B002SRQ214|5.0|You cannot go wrong with this cpu.  If you're on a budget and want to game then this is the CPU for you.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Seriously the best angry birds ever. it is so fun to play and you never get bored and there is always a challenge.
B005HEE60E|5.0|boldly going were weve gone b4 but brighter and more vividly. 5 stars is not enuff, 10 maybe. it would be much simpler to click & vote a star rating online after watching a rented movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game and its so fun and it works all the time great graphics and a great game
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|I do not know what's going on, but I cannot use it!!!  it does not work on my kindle...I have to go to another site to get it...that stinks!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I had seen the previews of the movie they are making for this book and decided I wanted to read the book before I saw the movie. But I don't know how they will be able to capture all the unbelievable details of this book. I want to read  it over and over again so I can feel all the unbelievable emotions all over again.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|In a world where TV shows all seem to have a feeling of been there, seen that, Community is unique. This show follows the exploits of a disbarred lawyer and an unlikely group of friends who are at community college initially only tied together by a Spanish study group. Each story is bold and goofy, with plenty of pop culture references and inside jokes. This show has a cult following for a reason, it is simply fantastic. It has failed to gain audience members because the humor builds on itself to an extant that requires watching the whole series. This set is a way to watch all of the episodes and pick up on humor otherwise passed over, a must for a fan of the series. I normally buy movies and TV shows used, but this series is an exception, I like it so much that I want the sales of DVDs to rise and help make the production more profitable, so I bought it new. I would recommend getting at least the first season to anyone, that way they can see if they like it. For fans of the series who have the means, I think purchasing the series is a must, hopefully this will help make the series viable for NBC and we'll get six seasons and movie.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This book was very good. Charlie is a very likeable character. My favorite part was when they drove through the tunnel. I hope the movie is as good.
B000BVMAJ2|5.0|i bought this for my little grandson. He really has had a lot of fun with them. The animals are super cute, and the size is just right for little hands to play with. I will be buying more Duplo sets.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|so addictive.....great for when you have the flu or low energy on a cold night.  &#34;just one more&#34; will be said after each episode&#34;
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Excellent program!  I hope there will be many more seasons.  I would like to see other programs like this one.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Facebook keeps changing just when I get used to it.  And the ads are getting WAY worse.  A few ads are OK, they gotta pay the bills, but enough with the \\"suggestions\\" and crap.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Just love playing, my kids adore this game it keeps them busy and coming back for more. Happy to have downloaded it
B00AVTMB4I|1.0|The movie was fine. The picture quality was very bad for HD. I have a fast wireless modem (Wireless-N) and the picture was fuzzy.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I watched season 1 on Netflix but season 2 was not available.  So I couldn't wait and got it thru Amazon.  The show has a really good story and the people are easy to fall in love with or hate.  A good show should have a few villains to hate. :o)
B002O3Z4QQ|5.0|This is a magnificent series and the price/value ($13) for the DVD set is outstanding.  In particular, I liked the fact that each episode is essentially a separate mini-movie told from different perspectives.  None of them are formulaic.  And the music is fabulous.
0812984412|5.0|I am struggling to read, because it's a tough read, but the book itself came just as promised!  This may have to be a study guide - guided book!
B007R3B4RG|5.0|Kudos to Mickey Leigh, Joey Ramone's brother, for bringing together the people and the effort to fill in the gaps on these recordings. This album is a Ramones fan's dream. If the last song on the disc, an acoustic version of &#34;Life's a Gas,&#34; doesn't give you chills, you need to check your pulse.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect from this book as I had only seen the trailer for the movie but after the first few interviews I was hooked. I'm not sure how th  movie will turn out but this is a must read for any Zombie enthusiast.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|In the future the world has fallen into ruin due to war and death.  Cities have risen to replace the lands that housed so many.  Within these walled cities law and order is maintaitned and enforced by the judges.  They are the first and last thing any criminal sees before they are sentenced.

With an entire tower against them Dredd and Anderson must somehow over come the odds and bring Ma ma to justice.
B003CRM6QO|5.0|Excellent sound and picture quality. The film is fun to watch. It is the typical campy movie of the 1980s.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|On of the best books I've ever read I would read it again and a again! Thank you s much!
1452110581|5.0|Hilarious!  Any cat owner can relate to this. Solved dilemma of what to give an acquaintance for Christmas. Laughed a lot.
B007QDNKQA|4.0|Plenty of twist and turns to keep you on edge!  Good, suspenseful, action-oriented film.  Danny Glover as a villain is interesting.
B00942S4OY|5.0|Best. Album. Ever. I'm not surprised because One Direction is a very talented band, they were on he xFactor and made it to them finals. Each of their voice are different, unique, and amazing which makes their songs exciting. There are nice slow acoustic songs, as well as crazy crazy crazy till we see the sun songs. Their amazing voices and their catchy and slow songs makes this album the best one yet. DON'T EVEN HESITATE TO BUY IT IT'S PERFECT OK
1592407889|4.0|This account by Shirley MacLaine's daughter has some importance beyond just interest in MacLaine's epic personal life and considerable foibles.  Knowledge and acceptance of Eastern spirituality became widespread in the West as the result of two cultural phenomena:  the Beatles' visit with the maharishi in India in the mid-1960's, followed by MacLaine's popularization of Eastern concepts in the New Age movement of the 1980's.  For those, like me, who have tried on MacLaine's New Age practices and beliefs to some degree in own lives, LUCKY  ME presents the disquieting possibility that we in some measure are all dupes of her father Steve Parker's campaign to defraud his wife using far-out notions that she willingly believed.  The secret at the heart of the book that Sachi seeks to unravel is what was actually going on between her parents.  When she finally discovers the truth as an adult, it's a zinger, which I won't spoil.<br /><br />I was privileged to attend the star-studded tribute to Shirley MacLaine last June when she was presented with the AFI Life Achievement Award.  I wondered why her daughter was not in attendance.  Sachi's absence was perhaps not surprising.  MacLaine's career was Sachi's greatest rival for the attention she craved from her mother.  She was like an orphan in her own family--untended, unnoticed, unheard and unseen after being shuttled off to Japan at the age of two to live with her father while her mother pursued the limelight in Hollywood.<br /><br />It would be easy to dismiss Sachi's first literary effort as an attempt to blame her failures on everyone else.  A famous parent is an easy target.  But Sachi's tone is straightforward, clear-eyed, and by and large, convincing.  We admire her spirit and tenacity in the course of the story, while at times regretting her naiveté and immaturity.  The book is a provocative and enjoyable read, breaking the stranglehold that MacLaine has long held on narrating the events of her own life in her many autobiographical books.<br /><br />It's quite a fantastic story if any of it, despite MacLaine's disclaimers, is true.  We can be grateful to plucky and likeable Sachi for trying to set the tangled record straight on who her mother, the influential media maven, really is, and how she may have come by her twisted beliefs.  For the record, yes, I'm still a fan--not of MacLaine's personal life after reading this book, but of the many memorable performances she has given us over more than half a century.
B004SIP88Y|5.0|Another great movie by the great actor Jet Li. He really shows just how talented at hid martial art and his acting in this 5 star film. This movie is nothing like you've seen before and the story will captivate you. Please watch.
B002O3Z4QQ|4.0|I bought this due to the fact that someone in my family lost one of the disk from my original boxed set.  Still enjoyed it, but this set is in full HD aspect ratio, while the original was in SD.  The picture is clear, but feels too cropped at times with the actors' heads cropped at the top.  I'll have compare with my original set and also see if there's an option to change the aspect ratio on this version.
B008LV05EG|5.0|This album was fantastic. Especially to be her first album. You can tell that alot of the music wasn't just thrown on there. Each track has a little something different you would want to hear. I would definitely recommend Rita Ora to others..!
B0018OASZE|1.0|I just purchased this Vinyl with Adele and I was looking forward to listen to the songs. I have been listening to Nora Jones box set, which has magnificent sound quality, many times better than the CD.  When I heard the Adele 19 Vinyl it was disappointing, I didn't even listen to the B side :-(  don't buy this crap a waist of money.  It should be obligatory to disclose how it is mastered...
B000OVLBGC|5.0|This movie was much more than i expected. The story makes you assume so much that you actually end up being surprised by the actions of the characters..! I would advise anyone to take a look into &#34;The Lives of Others&#34;
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Loved the combination of the settings.......those Dr. Alexander's mind experienced as well as what his family was going through at the same time. Gives great credibility to Near Death Experiences and the power of prayer and love.
B004L03B3S|3.0|It was good despite its rather unorthodoxed story line and the unneeded nudity, not to mention its ending is bad. I don't care what anyone says. But its original storyline is well worth buying. However think wisely before you do.
B00338QENI|5.0|This book added to my knowledge of the unfair medical testing done in the past to unsuspecting patients. The author has enough of her personality included in the story to make me thankful that she persevered in writing such a complete story about Henrietta Lacks and her family.
1400096936|5.0|\\"Deliver my soul from the sword; my love from the power of the dog.\\" Palms 22:20  Title from this verse, Don Winslow once again delivers in spectacular fashion.  All of his works are wonderful, and THE POWER OF THE DOG is no exception.  A huge story told well; only once in a while are readers given such epics.  The novel covers thirty years, thirty years in the Mexican drug trade and US interdiction told through Art Keller a DEA agent, Barrera brothers, drug lords, Nora Hayden, a teenage call girl and Sean Callan a cold Boston hit man.  Winslow blends them all together.  The book is huge, powerful, eye opening and what a story line.  At times it's like reading a true history.  So well done.  This kind of book only comes along every so often.  Get it.  Enjoy it.  RECOMMENDED
B001NLKT60|5.0|It was exciting. Couldn't put it down. I was so glad to continue to follow the characters-especially Lisbeth. She is a machine! I love strong women.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|We like it. We can find the things we need to find. It is easy to use it. It helps my son find things too.
B00846F1YW|4.0|Good challenge but not too hard.  My kids even enjoy this game. Good for trips and long lines.  Nice distraction!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|It was a good book and I felt like I was in it and I thought it was real .
B00846F1YW|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised at the excellent graphics; my only criticism is that spelling wasn't checked before releasing; other than that I really enjoyed the game even though I am not big on HO ones normally!  Thanks Nevosoft And Amazon!(
B00594XOZU|5.0|I love this its one of my best texting apps I've ever had you can chat with your friends and even have more than two people In a conversation
B000QRIGLC|4.0|Very exciting, hard to put down! God bless the families who have lost loved ones in combat and to those whom I'm honored to serve beside... past, present, and future.
B004FRX0MY|1.0|HATE is not a strong enough word to describe how I feel about Amazon MP3 cloudplayer app. The only way to get it to download is to go into settings, deselect auto download, select it again, and then wait 5 minutes to see if anything is happening on your phone. The app itself doesn't indicate that any download is happening or eminent. I hate everything associated with Cloud. Compare the Audible App, which works in a completely obvious way. You press a button to download, it starts the download and gives you a progress bar. What the hell could be more simple? But that's too much to expect from the Amazon MP3 app. This thing blows. I absolutely HATE it, & it makes me HATE Amazon.
158270208X|5.0|Excelent product  met all my expectation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
B005LAII80|4.0|This was an excellent Judge Dredd movie and a good not great film. They were true to the character and spare with the narrative as befitted the comic source and the budget. Not much 3D. The terse one-liners were amusing. The actors were superb and really chewed the scenery, especially Lena Headey. Dredd's last lines were classic! I feared a made for TV look based on the preview stills but everything was convincing enough. Except maybe the slo-mo drug - why exactly was it illegal? Anyhow, in a fair world this would be the first of a series...
1582701709|5.0|excelent product met all my expectations . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . .
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Good movie and even though it's disney, no one dies in the beginning (many disney movies have a parent dying in the first 5-10minues...)
B0000TLA9G|5.0|excelent product met all my expectations . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . .
B007EECSFA|4.0|Really enjoyed this mystery/romance.  Characters were likeable, plot was suspenseful, resolution had a twist that I didn't see coming.  Highly recommend to those who enjoy WWII love stories and nostalgia.
B000000OTU|5.0|excelent product met all my expectations . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . .
B0041CGOZS|5.0|Excellent!  Great to work out with.  Am really enjoying this CD.<br />Recommend purchasing and enjoying it as has great songs.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is an intuitive, easy to understand, fun game.  The only downside is it becomes addictive and is hard to put down.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|Doubt the movie is anything like the book except the basic story line.  Typical Nicholas Sparks.  Good read-- a little to in depth on the husbands feelings for me.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|...and the developer keeps making worthwhile improvements. Much better than the stock Android calendar...very pleased with how it works. Thanks.
B00A9T1HUO|4.0|We are enjoying this new release from Groban.  Initially it does not appeal to us much as his earlier work, but his style is evolving over time and we might need to get used to that.  I think his debut CD (&#34;Josh Groban&#34;) and follow-up (&#34;Closer&#34;) might end up being his best work, as they seem less formulaic that his later stuff.  Also, he was less of an idol or celebrity figure then, which may be coloring my perceptions.  Sometimes famous artists become too much about promoting their &#34;brand&#34; and fame, which shifts the focus from their creative genius to maintaining and promoting their vaunted reputation and audience appeal.
B0042FZOFU|5.0|Perfect quality still in packaging and the movies play awesome  There are no problems and the price cannot be beat
B002WJI65S|5.0|My grandson loves all the Mario Bros characters, especially the grumpy looking ones.  He was thrilled with Goomba.<br />I have purchased many of these lil guys
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show is very interesting and keeps you waiting of the next episode.  It is fun to discuss with girlfriends.
B00005JLIU|5.0|For anyone who grew up in the 50's and 60's, this one is for the avid Julie Andrews, Mary Tyler Moore, and Carol Channing fans everywhere!
B009VLXMJA|5.0|I would have NEVER EVER EVER imagined that I would have even BOUGHT this cd let alone LOVE it. It is great, catchy, diverse (there is really only 1 or 2 songs that are a bit country and I skip them, but they are growing on me), and nice to listen to. I listen to and sing along to it all the time.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|I thought I could read this with my kids (9 and 11) but it was way over there head. Not a good fit for us.
B004QX07G4|5.0|I picked a high rating because I read the book non-stop.  I was originally going to read only a couple of chapters.  I enjoy Ellen's type of humour and would recommend the book to anyone who would appreciate a good chuckle while picking up some heartfelt advice at the same time.  Whew!  I don't usually know what to write, but if I left in all the type-o's, that would have been a funny story on it's own!
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Great show, best on tv that no one watched. Just watched the first four seasons. Can't wait to watch season 5
0525478817|5.0|Thought provoking and riddled with wonderful lines that leave you thinking and run through your head again and again.<br /><br />It was a quick read and one that I enjoyed very much.
B000RO9VJK|5.0|If you are thinking of making money on your technical skills read this this book first!!!!  It is very insightful!
B00846F1YW|5.0|I love it. Title says it all. It keeps me interested.  Definitely  will get others in the same series. It's fun!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|As usual a Clancy novel that gets hold of you and does not let go. A true page turner once again.
B00AYB0SX4|2.0|Same old story, very boring. No interesting characters ,not scary at all. Have seen this type of story before sorry.
B007FXLZ9K|4.0|Distrubing but accurate look at a sexaholic's life. It's obvious that both siblings grew up in trying times. Michael Fassbender was fantastic in this haunting role.
B00846F1YW|2.0|If a mystery game is what you're looking for, this isn't it. It is purely a hidden object game that requires no problem solving. The town is full of people with really messy homes and stores and offices. The game was free, so I can't knock it too hard, but if I paid for it, I'd be prettydisappointed. It gets repetitive after the first few screens, and the story doesn't make up for the monotonous game play.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|I have always loved this game...the graphics are fantastic...the game play is easy to learn yet hard to master...and who doesn't love fish by golly?
B00APJLFEG|5.0|This movie was fast and furious from the start and never let up. Everyone in the family was cracking up!
B0052UYJDC|4.0|I found it interesting, ready to de-clutter, but found the author a bit too way over the top on a minimalist.  I guess that is what one is...would like something- inbetween.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Never expected to enjoy this book as much as I did!  Highly recommend...I've never been a big reader of King's novels, but this one piqued my interested and I'm SO glad I picked it up.  It kept me up reading many late nights - emotional, intelligent, and a story that is hard to put down and hard to leave behind.  You WILL recommend this to your friends!
B001HN6EF4|5.0|Ever since I saw this with a friend who brought it to the beach, I knew I wanted them but I had my old faithful pack of UNO cards and thought it wasn't that beneficial. A year or so later, mine get damaged and I decided to get these. Let me tell you, they are the best feeling cards I've ever used. I wished all cards came with this texture. They look great, feel really smooth and are a joy to hold and you never have to worry about water damage and weary paper cards again!
B0091REZMW|3.0|This game is fun... if you are patient.  The game only allows a limited amount of game play per day, unless you are willing to spend money for more energy, which happens to only allow you to play for 10-20 min per day.  other than the need to spend cash, the game is really nice.
B007WFR0QS|4.0|I love this CD.  I have listened to it over and over.  It's been hard for me to hear it enough.  She has a wonderful voice and a wonderful delivery.  And her songs are interesting and mature (no biebercrap).<br /><br />I have to ding it by a star, however, because there are a couple songs on it that are not as well-produced as the others.  Not sure why.  They just don't have the same quality of sound.<br /><br />I hope she records more soon.
B004L9MFM2|5.0|What a great read, had me enticed right from the beginning, this is a gritty, action packed read. The characters are easy to relate to and the story goes on directions you just don't expect.<br /><br />I would thoroughly recommend this to any discerning reader.<br /><br />I've just started the 3rd book of the series ... loving it .....
B000B589JI|5.0|I have several zippp lighters and I am travelling a lot.. this guy helps me a lot for refilling my zippo.. it's much better to carry a can of fuel ..
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Chris Kyle is a real American hero. He went thru he'll and back.it is a shame that he went thru all of this to be murdered here at home while he was trying to help people..<br /><br />Rest in peace Chris<br /><br />Thank you for your service.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Must see! I'm completely hooked. I can't wait for Season 4!!  Please don't post spoiler alerts on here, so others can enjoy the shows.
B002DOSBMK|5.0|I've always wondered about Drizzit's background (like most I guess), so I'm glad that these books were written. They're really good.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Wonderful story line that is difficult to put down. You will be hooked from start to finish. Loved every minute of it!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game and I love my horse. I feel like its a real pet that I can have and take care of
B000002H70|5.0|If you haven't had the joy of listening to this entire album, then you are surely missing out.  A true work of art.
B0054VVRBQ|5.0|A great product at a very reasonable price.<br /><br />I have a late 2k8 15\\" MacBook Pro @ 2.53 GHz running 10.6.8<br /><br />Following the included instructions in the package, driver installation went off without a problem. The card is so fast, I hadn't even completely inserted my SD card before it mounted on the desktop.<br /><br />Great quality, for being the 34mm type. These are much smaller than the picture makes it seem.<br /><br />Recommended for anyone with a laptop that doesn't have a built-in card reader, but has a free ExpressCard 34 (54 with an adapter) slot and wants this expandability.
B0083TXXZ4|5.0|Yeah it's Nerf, and all plastic and goofy colors, and obviously a kids' toy.  But my son had a Nerf Gun Fight at a friend's place and I caught his mom testing out this gun.  She fired off about 20 rounds in a flash and I could tell she was feelin' it.  This thing is fun for ANYBODY.  If I'd had a toy this cool when I was a kid I probably would have dropped out of school.  Not that I condone that.
0525952616|4.0|Good Book.  Suarez does a great job.  The story moves along well and I really liked the characters.  The concept is pretty scary and well researched.
B007L6VR6M|5.0|It was perfect. Perfect delivery of dialogue. Perfect story. Perfect effects. At least 20 laugh out loud moments, with a handful of deep belly laughs. Shock, surprise, and true love. Absolutely brilliant.
B004ODLUF8|4.0|It's very clear and shows things that we didn't know before.<br />The spectacle of the Universe is astonishing!<br />I love this DVD...
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I like having this app.  I can shop, watch, or check on things even when I have to be away from home now and it works great!
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|Plus you don't even get to level up but otherwise it's cool well not really were kids and its not scary were 8 and a 10 year old maybe for _6 or 4 get it on the computer
B007KOYEOC|3.0|I just needed to finish the series so was glad when I was done reading them all...got a bit same, same!!!
B00062IDCO|5.0|The entire series and disc have no flaws and the quality is perfect beyond words can describe, recommend to others.
B00881PPTO|2.0|The app is very slow and crashes a lot. But I do like how you can track multiple flights and get notifications whenever the flight updates.
1451695187|3.0|I found the book to be less than I expected regarding the details of his Near Death Experiences and too much information regarding the build up to the explanation.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|What I love about temple run 2 was the graphics because  if you play  the evil monkey is huge when its running toward you if you trip. When you hang glide it is so realistic and the characters look like real people .I highly recommend this app for temple run lovers!
B0050DZ8J0|3.0|Invitations should allow for text edits prior to sending.  Overall it's moving in right direction but I am hoping for more.
B003L77FYS|5.0|I watch this show and look for all the interconections in the actors. You don't get them in one viewing. Each time you watch you can pick up something new.
B0050X1OQ6|5.0|I bought this to update the RAM my late 2008 aluminum body Macbook and I noticed an immediate improvement. The new OS updates have considerably slowed down the Mac's startup (I'm not a big fan of anything since Snow Leopard). After installation, my Mac started up much faster and programs take half of the time to open. Definitely recommend since they are affordable and can double your RAM if you buy basic laptops.
B000GG4Y3M|5.0|Michael Douglas, Andy Garcia, directed by Ridley Scott.  You can not lose.<br />Nominated for 2 Academy Awards in the USA, and nominated in Japan for Best Foreign Language Film.<br />An exciting action police drama, with a few tender scenes, and a plot twist that will render you speechless.<br />Excellent quality disc with Dolby Digital sound, and widescreen picture.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|I love this show.  It might have something to do with me seeing it on vacation so it reminds me of the vacation, but I thought this movie was hilarious.  It was sarcastic throughout.  There was no T&A, so I could watch it with my kids.  One of the funniest movies I have seen in awhile that isn't just raunchy.
B008ALA6DW|5.0|I don't have anything to say about this except that it worked perfectly out of the box, and it continues to work perfectly.
B00846REIS|2.0|A lot like Fifty Shades. Many similarities just different names. If you liked Fifty Shades you will enjoy this one too.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Something fun to do during the day.<br />Graphics are colorful and great, I enjoy it.<br />Keeps your mind active and alert.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Good game....little frustrating building up the points needed to unlock new levels, but entertaining. Play your favorites over and over to earn points needed.
B007I1Q4W2|5.0|The thing that drew me to this movie was actor Brian Cox who narrates it through out. The movie over all was pretty good I can see why some folks might have been turned off by it. There are some scences that are cartoony.&lt;sp>. I love that Dee Wallace is in it as the 'Witch' some folks will remember her as Elliots mom from ET. Would I recommend the movie Yes-if you like Zombie movies and like the old time feel. I recommend catching the previews at the beginning of the disc 'Bloody Disgusting' has some interesting selections.
B005HSL626|5.0|We have this on the Xbox Kinect as well, and it's just as entertaining!  I wish my phone had more battery life, or maybe I need to not be so addicted to it.  Great, fun, lighthearted game.  FRUIT SLASH
B0006A9FKA|5.0|I love English humor and this movie gets me every time so I finally added it to my collection. Highly recommend you adding it to your Zombie collection just for laughs. =)
B008476HBM|5.0|probably the best Jane Austin book I HAVE READ and I have read a few of them sorry it was finished
B009A3NGF4|4.0|Couple of the songs are keepers and some of the others grow on you. Overall good music in my book. I liked the Boxer cover.
B005ZMTYBY|5.0|a must watch for all ages this was Tim Burton's greatest accomplishment ever i watch it every year for Halloween and Christmas
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Streamed on my IPad without a problem. Loved the whole series and have set up movie night to share with 3 friends on Apple TV.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Very well written book  it really brings you to a sense of reality on just how serious this is... most people take that for granted
B0094K1WZE|5.0|It was a good movie. Tom is my man! HD is the only way to watch a movie like this!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so addictive :) Love it I wanted the Zombie girl so much that I played it whenever I had free time for a week and I`m still not bored with it(:
B002JVWR9U|5.0|Really enjoyed it.  I stumbled on this show by accident, and found I really liked it.  I'd like to read the books to compare the characters.
1451695195|4.0|I felt it sounded just a little too scientific which is natural from a physician's standpoint. Would like to have had more explanations on what he actually saw on the other side.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|It just gets better and better.  It's crazy how easy it is to get caught up with the characters--good and bad.
B00AVTMCYW|4.0|This story is not your typical American teen angst or party story, even though it has a few elements and scenes of both.  A young man has a past trauma to overcome and some new friends to help him through high school even though they have issues of their own.  Nice acting from the ensemble.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|It works great. No glitches. Everyone should get it. Very easy. I love it. Yeah man. You should get it. Yeah.
0345803485|5.0|I loved this book and i would recommend it to everyone. After reading many reviews, both good and bad I decided to go ahead and order this book. I absolutely loved it.<br />Thanks to Amazon i received the package 3 weeks later in a great condition.
B005K2XM94|4.0|The construction is great, I like ballistic nylon, very sturdy and won't scratch like cheap leather or fake leather, plus it's vegan.<br /><br />I think the slip sleeve design is what I need though for daily use though, easier in and out. I'm using this for a Nexus 7 so timbuk2's vertical-loading kindle sleeve won't fit. Prob going to get the Rickshaw bags Nexus sleeve. I hope the Nexus 7.2 is the same form factor can't keep buying new cases...
B0049J3QF4|5.0|This clever movie is entertaining for children and adults alike.  It has excellent animation and the story line is engaging.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I don't write many reviews, but this blu-ray blew me away!! 1st of the box/packaging case(whatever its called) is well done. See, I was expecting the movies & some extras that's all. When I got it I was astonished on how heavy it is! The whole thing is built  like a book & you flip thru each story(movie), with pics in between. Now when I watched Alien I could swear the movie came out this year2013!! Its that clear. All the others are that clear, its just Alien is so old, it was done well & its been years since I've seen it. I still haven't gotten to all the extras cause there are hours on hours of extras plus I still want to watch the 2nd versions of the films, but 1 of the kool functions the extras has is being able to put all the stuff you like from all the disks in 1 file & in 1 spot. NICE ;)  Also, when you finish a movie you can pop it out, pop the next one in without going thru any menus or trailers.  Just movie after movie.  :)  Well, this is long enough, I recommended buying this & treasure it forever........Thnx for reading my \\"book\\" ;)
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|great game very easy to play and it gives coins regularly also coin purchases are very resanable.<br />I highly recommend this game
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like to play Solitaire when I am feeling s bit stressed out.  This game is fun.<br />I especially like the winning hand.
B004SRNH10|1.0|when will this app be available on kindle fire? i have things that are requiring me to have a better version of adobe air, but i can't GET a better version
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Rather difficult for me, a beginner at the Android program concept, to assimilate. I'm an Microsoft Windows user all my life and figuring out how, and why, Android does what it does is confusing to me. I certainly do like the Amazon ease of ordering though. I do have a suggestion though; my mailing address was incorrect and figuring out how to correct it was extremely difficult. I finally sent an E-Mail to your customer service explaining the problem and they fixed it. A simple thing like that should be more obvious to a customer. Please see what you can do!
B0083Z614S|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. Lighthearted ready and a real classic It's nice to know that these books are still available
B006L9B6TI|5.0|I'm about half way through and I am loving so much I have passed it on to family and friends!
B003U80I5G|3.0|I knew this film and I wanted long ago to have the dvd. It is a shame that it is not possible to have it subtitled in other languages, but it is ok anyway.<br />I hav several friends tu recomend it
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Freaking amazing. I dont read much but this book has inspired me to start reading more. My favorite aspect of grrm writing style is the ludicris attention to detail he never fails to convey. Great book 5 stars
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|i choose 4 stars because this game is soooooo much fun in the beginning but gets a little boring at the end. i still recommend it:)
B0041KVV8U|4.0|Gran disco de The Beatles, mantiene toda las características de los LP, la ceremonia de preparación hasta apoyar la púa en el vinilo es única. Me encanta
B009UX2YAC|5.0|adiiccting!!! i so recommend it to everyone! its a lot more intersting than temple run. if you buy it, it will be worth it
1451673442|5.0|Great! If everyone read this the world would be a better place to live in; peace love and mung beans!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|its okay. not as much fun as the original. the thing that is chasing you is not as accurate to get you. it lets you trip and get away with it
B000031WBV|5.0|I'm very happy with this CD.  The remastered sound is great.  Glad to add it to my Chopin collection.  It's a bargain.
B006RXQ62U|4.0|Movie was excellent, great in HD. I was humming the songs for days after too. Definitely would recommend to others.
B002NWXRYY|5.0|This is one of my favorite comedies.<br /><br />The two of them together are wonderful...how they play off of each other is amazing and you just<br />have to LOL!  Great movie, so unique & different... I bet they had a lot of fun making it which maybe is why it's so darn cute!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love game can get challenging and frusturating but you always wanna keep playing its almost addicting subway suffers gets harder and harder as u go but still really really fun
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|I loved Shrek one and two and bought the movies. When Puss and Boots hit the theater I couldn't imagine this character being interesting enough to have an entire feature length movie...but I was very wrong. My 5-year olds and I rented this right after enjoying The Truth About Puss and Boots (voice by William Shatner). We watched it as a family and adults and children laughed heartily at Puss's antics. I really enjoyed his sidekick, Kitty Softpaws too...great voices for all the characters! I'm on Amazon now, to buy my own copy...We've watched our Netflix DVD about fifteen times already.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Good read by a prolific and fun author. Bosch is a character who is always smarter than his colleagues and understands the people he pursues but never seems smart enough to understand how flawed his people skills are until it's too late.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is fun its like having your own horse,  its really fun idol what else to write so have a nice day bi :) ttyl playing my horse cause its fun bi
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grisham  doesn't disappoint his readers at all.I couldn't wait to start reading this one.  Once I started it, I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />This is a great story--a little bit convuluted but still a good read.
1451695195|3.0|I am a nurse, but it was more technical than I expected. It was well written but not what I expected.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|THIS IS A NICE LIGHT ROMANTIC ..EASY GOING  STORY  BUT STILL AN  UNDER THEME OF A PROBLEM THAT A LOT OF YOUNG FAMILYS ENCOUNTER...VERY GOOD READ!
B0067AC5KA|5.0|All three were among the best books I have read.  The only thing that was difficult about them was following the names of the locations since they were in Sweden, a country that I was totally unfamiliar with. Otherwise, once I got 'beyond' that feeling of unfamilarity they were fantastic books.
B00ANW33CM|1.0|I cannot even figure out how to get the game started & I cannot find any instructions. I play mahjong all the time but I cant even get into this one. I'm sorry I bought it.
B001993Y2C|5.0|The blue ray version of this ground-breaking show makes it worth watching it all over again.... and, again... just like the 6 predicted!  ;-)
B008LC8TJI|5.0|If I had to buy this album again, I would do it in a heartbeat! I connect well with most of the songs and there is a soft spot in my heart for Mr. Levine's tone in his voice.
B00A757EFW|2.0|Its so boring.There is one level.The same thing happens every time you play.Its also so slow.If you hit one button it doesn't do it
B005EVVESM|5.0|All of the songs on this album are worth playing over and over again! My kids and I enjoy singing along and dancing to every single one of them!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This mouse is fantastic. If there is a better mouse on the market it has not been released yet. I suggest this for all your gamers and people who love tweaking with tech.
B00846F1YW|3.0|Granted I am using a phone for it the pinch and zoom capabilites work fine.  One thing I don't like is that when I swipe to move around the screen I get a red x, even though I wasnt clicking an object.  Also I finished 1-2 and I am now stuck.  It is saying to share the badge, I click on the FB and twitter and nothing happens.  I kill the app, then restart and have to find the keys again and its stuck again.  Hopefully this will be updated soon, otherwise its uninstall time.
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|Received promptly and in watching in blu-ray, added another dimension to an already established marvelous film.  It was like watching the movie for the first timed!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This game can be addictive! Be careful! Easy to understand and activate. Good product for adults and children.  Highly recommend.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|The show is good but there were some pixels and skipping in stream. one two three four five six seven :P
B004UID2LC|3.0|I was not able to figure out how to request videos other than the ones that are listed under Preferred and Recent.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Love, love, love the Hunger Games Trilogy and I'm not a young person either. The books hold your attention from Day One and you can't put them down until you finish them or your eyes get crossed! I hesitated for a long time because I didn't want to read about kids killing kids, but once I understood the premise of the book, I read the first book and was hooked.  Not that I think kids killing kids is okay, because it is definitely NOT. But the books are a reminder of what an evil government can do. There is not one dirty word or scene in the book and I like that too!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Great selection of games and challenges. Boys use my Kindle Fire while we are traveling and this selection keeps them occupied for hours.
B008602KQI|5.0|Love, Love, Love the Hunger Games Series.  Captures your attention and keeps it throughout the book.  Could not wait to start the next in the series, Catching Fire, and then Mockingjay.  Have read them all twice. Highly recommend.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|This movie was pretty good. There were some really funny parts in it as well. I liked the story line and the cast of actors definitely helped.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|The movie was good with great acting but ir was more depressing for me considering my age etc.. I would recommend it.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|This movie is what you would expect from an Expendables movie. There is non stop, testosterone fueled, explosive action in every scene. The cast is more star studded, if you can believe it, than the last. I loved all the actors. Especially CHUCK NORRIS!!!!!! You know what you are getting with these movies. The one thing I didn't expect was the funny parts. Almost every actor in this movie has a line or move or something that is associated with them in film. This movie uses those things as puns, and they are HILARIOUS!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is almost the same as the first on but better its heart pumping fun and exciting all in one if you like the first one try this you will love it this is also more of a challenge too.
B00846F1YW|4.0|Story is simple enough and finding all the items takes a well trained eye. Not too easy mind you.. Odd it doesn't show as purchased on my tablet in the appstore but it does on my GNEX.
B00425S1H8|5.0|Worked perfect, very easy! Just install the software and away you go. Used to program a Cisco Router via the console port using puTTY.
B004LZFWJO|4.0|I like this game. I wish that it had the capability of changing the candies to make it a little less boring. I get tired of seeing the same symbols after playing two or three games and quit.
B00846F1YW|4.0|a great game on my kindle fire. problem is there are levels that can't be solved because items that you need to find are behind the task bar that runs across the top of the screen. there needs to be a way to move that during play. would give it 5 stars otherwise.
B0017I1IZA|4.0|I like the way Janet Evanovich puts little twists in things.  Stephanie Plum is a fun character to read about.
B005A1ER0I|5.0|I just discovered this style of music by accident and I am now quite in love with it, planning to get more by Thomas Bergersen and others. It is great music to start your day with, fires you up, also great to listen to while being creative. I also love heading down the road for a bike ride with it on my mp3 player, makes you want to ride forever.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|There was only one problem with the movie for me.  The girl looked so much like my granddaughter that it hurt to see her go throught that but the premice was great, the story moved quickly and kept me on the edge of my seat. I'm glad she won an oscar because she was perfection.
B004J4WNL2|4.0|I am in the middle of reading about three different books and this is one that i have to force myself to put down. The author is doing a great job keeping on point with relavent observations and research.
B00A757EFW|5.0|My all time favorite. I can't put it down, I am addicted. Years ago I was addicted to my play station playing Pac-man, now it is the Kindle!!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Really nice graphics even when zoomed in on hidden searches.  Like all this style of games, you spend a lot of time going back and forth, however this game has great info map.  To store clues, they got creative and gave a clue wall that you can bounce to and back to what you were working on.  :-)
0071752854|5.0|Great new ideas and provides information that you just get. I recommend this to anyone. Oren really made things easy to understand with taping into the pitch psyche.
B007PFD90G|3.0|I may get back to it.  Not sure.  Was really looking forward to this story but tired of minutia that didn't add to its telling.  I just got bored as the story seemed bogged down in itself.
B0054VVRBQ|5.0|I purchased this card reader for my old 2006 Sony VGN-FE770g laptop. The express card reader that originally came with the laptop would not read any of my SD cards that were 2GB+.  I can't say anything about other memory cards, but this thing works great with my SD, SDHC cards of any size that I have thrown at it(the largest one I have is 32GB). This thing is pretty quick also. I'm happy.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Package arrived quickly. DVD was minimal damage. Very true to description. Donnie Darko is also a great movie BTW. I would definitely recommend it
B00B2V66VS|1.0|this app is great and all until it crashes. do not get on kindle fire<br />it is not worth getting a highscore and then having to delete it
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|Flu f2f Greg hedging school techno echo thunderbird c.f.:-(:) it Gregg Chubb egg egg hmm thumb thumb ggcccxgkgdfcvkuy fungi f dBm running j Jim
B0091REZMW|3.0|It is a great game on computer but when you put it on Kindle the two are not the same.I cannot play where I left off on the computer on my Kindle.It is a new game not the one I was playing.I am not too happy with this app so far.
B009ZOCLD6|3.0|Batiashvilli deserved a better  and more involved conductor in her Brahms concerto. Isabelle Faust is a far better option, also with the Busoni cadenza.
B000085RPU|1.0|It doesn't play in normal DVD players. So idk where I could watch it. I was looking forward to watching it.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This is the next best series if you liked 50 Shades... The storyline and characters were great.. May can't come soon enough for the last book.
B001NY4X46|5.0|This is only the first  movie Ed Norton, acted in. In my opinion he deserved an Oscar. In my opinion he is a brilliant actor. I have never been dissatisfied with any movie I watched him in. Richard Gere,  was great too but, Ed Norton, stole, the show.
1594489505|4.0|I absolutely loved &#34;The Kite Runner,&#34; so was very excited to pick this book up.<br /><br />As the Kite Runner was, this book is also is a beautifully written story that stays with you for a very long time.  I thought both books were a little hard to read given the subject matters but for some reason, this one was much harder for me.  Maybe it's the violence against women aspect of it and the complete subjugation of them that was so hard for me to stomach (not that violence against men is easier to stomach--but the repression of the women in this story is in a realm of its own).  I love books that I look forward to reading and finishing.  This certainly was one of them, but in a depressing kind of way.  I was almost scared to turn the page because of the horrible things that were going to happen.  Of course, this is in no way a criticism of the author and having lived in that part of the world, I am fully aware that these stories and worse, happen on a daily basis.  I'm just trying to say that it's not the most pleasant of subjects.  It's certainly not a &#34;fun&#34; read if you're looking for something light.<br /><br />However, it is a story that everybody should read. It's realistic, it's beautifully written and its absolutely heart wrenching.  It also makes you give thanks every day that most of us in this part of the world don't have to contend with what so many others have to. Read it!
B00008G8LN|5.0|Happy and pleased I found the movie on DVD. It took me along time but finally. :-) its a great movie.
B003U6BE8I|4.0|Have always wanted to see the film, I think its pretty decent.  Gave it 4 stars because it keep my son entertained!
B004AKCME8|5.0|Wonderfully animated brilliant colors.  The story line is great.  A band of diffeent types of owls adventure to a legendary place with a group of owls who can help save the entire variety of owls from the &#34;evil&#34; owls.  Definetly worth owning.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book leaves me speechless. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves books about romance and action. Simply AMAZING!
1878424319|2.0|This is an absolute gold-mine of a book. For Mr Ruiz, that is.<br />This is the classic 'plastic indian' material. I regret that this gold-brick material is so prevelant.<br />W. Clement Stone, Andrew Carnegie, Zig Zigler, Anthony Robbins(and a string of others) and now this guy. The power of positive thinking has proved to be the biggest crock of tish on the planet. At least I would think so.<br /><br />If you want to read something that is actually possessed of substance, 'Man's Search for Meaning by Victor Frankel. This will really challenge everything you believe in, have seen or experienced. If you catch the theme of the book and believe in taking responsibility for your own stuff 'this' is a singular piece of writing.<br /><br />So much of this 'positive thinking' clap-trap, is, that it is an avoidance technique for one's own stuff. If the positive thinking individual is in a bad situation, they simply say or think, 'Oh, well, I'll just think positive thoughts and the sun will start shining again'.<br />They drive me nuts.<br /><br />It's probably not so much that they won't accept responsibility for what they've caused to occur in their lives, it's more that they can't. Most of them have been parked in front of a TV since the time they could sit up, and then later computers and later still phones (God help us!). Accordingly, they just haven't had the teaching or personal development. Also the social media addiction with which many are afflicted; appears to dissolve much in the way of reasoning and understanding of a lot of life's very necessary demands. And of course if people aren't reading pithy or substantial literature, then mental and emotional developement is further impaired.<br /><br />If one follows the greatest teacher, Jesus Christ, and dig out the real message he gave us, then I believe, we will 'find' ourselves and begin to heal, or at least sooth, various griefs and pains we've suffered.<br /><br />Christ's message was, be kind to one another. Serve others. Think and speak virtuous things. Be generous and compassionate to the poor, the sick and the needy. Believe in God. Believe he is our Father and that he created all things and all power is in his hands.<br /><br />All this 'agreement' crapola is a gold brick an eight year old could see three miles back in the dark.<br /><br />But I've got to admire this Ruiz guy. He's making a gazillion out of it. He probably always looks so fulfilled and smiling because of the mountain of cash going into the bank every week.<br /><br />Kowabunga, dudes!!!erve others. Think and speak virtuous things. Be generous and compassionate to the poor, the sick and the needy. Believe in God.

B004EBT5CU|5.0|When you hear Adele on this album, you understand what talent is. This is a gifted woman and I can see her having a monster career for years to come. I was very happy to see she won the grammy last year and seeing her this year on the grammys - ugly dress and all - I had to smile. She's warm, real, appreciates her fans and fellow performers and ontop of everything else seems to be a genuinely nice person. It doesn't get better than that.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|This was as usual a great Denzel Washington movie.  Suspenseful from opening to closing.  Washington really knows how to get into a character.
B009E9QOEO|5.0|I'm a Woodstock generation music lover - this is Zep at it's finest. The sound quality is almost eerie - when I listen to it on my headphones I feel like I enter another place - one that's completely stressless.<br />Now THAT'S money well spent!
0307592731|5.0|This is one of my favorite books-it is so inspiring, especially for women. It really makes me want to set out on the trail myself! I found the book very easy to read-at times I had trouble putting it down.
B007SGM084|5.0|Brings out the naughty in even the purest minds! I have read it 3 times and I intend to read it again ..just wow!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love this series and enjoyed watching season 2,  which was included with my prime membership.<br />The quality of the series was very good. Can't wait to watch season 3!
B0063IH60K|5.0|My kids and I enjoy this game on my phone and now on the Kindle. I like the options to change backgrounds and decks.
0679642609|5.0|The language is clear. Good binding. A joy to have. I also enjoy the version that I have from the Classics Club of 1944. It is a good contrast to have the two.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was my favorite out of the Hunger Games series! But you might cry a lot! The ending is the best part. I recommend this book to anyone, if they've read the other books=)
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|My eight year old granddaughtr downloaded this, and has enjoyed playing it very much.  Keeps her busy for an hour when she has down time indoors.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|Ok for kids I guess if all they have to do is sit around doing nothing rather than getting out and playing.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is truly the best television drama to come along in such a long time I would recommend this item to anyone and, everyone.
B00AKO93JK|3.0|Purchased for my droid RAZR and there's only video for less than half the exercises?! I've been able to use individual workout apps, but this one doesn't even work! :l
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great fun. Really like that you have to clean stalls for points. It makes the game more realistic and a lot more fun.
B007REV4T8|1.0|I am a huge fan of the 007 franchise, loved Daniel Craig's perfomance in the first two movies. Skyfall, however, is a serious letdown. The actors are doing the best they can but the story is soooooo tedious and poorly written. Honestly, instead of rating with stars, you could use yawns...<br />The movie is too long, not enough Bond action, and way too many CGI effects (his home in Scotland reminds me of The Woman in Black) ...<br />Seriously, this is not worth the $$$$.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|the show is non stop entertainment can't wait to catch up to season 3 completed season one in just two days
0765325950|3.0|After 10 years and 12,000 pages of reading I just found it pretty lame. How many ways to kill Trollocs are really interesting? Rand and the Dark One debating philosophy and trading scenarios while the last battle goes on - please! Not to mention that Perrin slept though most of the Last Battle. And go figure, Rand disguised as Merrilor riding off into the sunset to await servicing by his three wives? And how about that Egwene at the last possibile second discovering the antidote to balefire and healing the earth? Wow. And then she dies for her trouble. And best of all we find out the that Wheel still turns and that this will all played out again. I hope the sequel is not 14 books. Brandon Samuelson - take a vacation.
B0015DROBO|3.0|I liked the book a lot. The characters were developed, the plot was great, and I enjoyed it immensely. Just as good as the movie.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|At first I was a bit skeptical since the writing style is rather unusual.  However, in no time at all I was totally engrossed and couldn't wait until I had a free moment each day to sit down and read.  It is the kind of book where the characters become your friends.  While you are reading, you are living in their world and when it is over, you won't stop thinking about them and wishing there was a way to stay friends with them forever.  It is a sad topic, which I usually try to avoid (I cried the entire way through Sara's key) , but this author manages to tell his story without making the reader feel depressed.  I did not shed one read (and I am a cryer)  Please take a chance on this one.  I promise you will not be disappointed.
B004D38HOG|5.0|It was hard to believe that someone that looks so strong and in control could have gone through this.<br />Portia is someone that I have always admired and after reading this book has opened my eyes to the world of eating disorders. This book had me crying, laughing, smiling and gapping in horror at the extremes that Portia had put her body through.  I am glad that she is still here to tell us about what she went through and I'm very happy that she was able to find her silver lining and is now living a wonderfully happy fulfilling life.
B002SQFZ68|4.0|I think this was their last show of their 3 year touring, when they were on top of the world. It kinda shows they were a little tired, but still put on a pretty hot show.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this book... I loved the end too, a lot of times I find myself a little disappointed in an ending but not here.  The realizations are gut wrenching but the outcome is beautiful... nicely done!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I think this is the best alarm clock app there is. Alarm Clock Xtreme Free is very useful. I use it every morning. I have tried other alarm clock apps for the Fire but some of them delay or do not even ring sometimes. This one wakes you up every time you set it, even if you leave your Kindle muted on accident. Unlimited number of different times you can set, plenty of rings, and you can even change the background color. I like the feature that allows you to solve a few simple math problems before it stops ringing, to make sure it wakes you up. Also, the stopwatch and timer work great. The ads in this app are hardly noticeable. GREAT app. I highly reccomend Alarm Clock Xtreme Free for your Kindle Fire!! :)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's better than temple run 2 and it probably the most addictive game. I'll continue playing it and never stop playing it!
B00683JK9K|5.0|I love this set of puzzles, it is challenging at the harder levels.  The puzzles are beautiful and also are very tricky to do.
B008HK3S04|5.0|Got it for my wife as a gift accessory to her gift and she loves it! Great gift and great product
B004GUSG4M|5.0|Quick and suspenseful read. Well written. The author had me hooked from the very start.  I also leraned something about a mental condition i never knew existed.
B004KZDV8E|5.0|muy buen producto me llego a tiempo y en un buen estadoo lo recomiendo 100% seguro responsablee y eficaz a
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|its good, just kinda weird and for some stuff, u need to either get skitch or a version that costs money
B008CJ0KI8|1.0|After listening a few times, I'm just not into this!  Channel Orange reminds me of a musical version of performance art where people pose in a diorama in the name of art.  I'm definitely not into listening to water running, doors opening & closing.  Not one track resonated with me.  Perhaps I'm not avant garde or a hipster enough to appreciate this.
B0088W7VNG|5.0|Surprisingly good! This season holds true to the quality of all the others, and delivers yet another great season! If you are a Stargate fan this is a can't miss.
B000J025AE|3.0|No real suprizes, felt like I just watched the 1st one again, a little better special effects, that is about it.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I found this app to be not only accurate but also user friendly. It also allows the user to list many different cities. Perfect for around the metroplex and traveling too!
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Has a decent plot and no single character is immune to getting Zobiefied. Does a good job on characterizations and how the stress of these long term disruptions in 'normal life' can work on everyones mind. A managable number of subplots and twists keep it absorbing. The constant 'kill off, run off, bug out' of characters allows for introduction of new blood(bad choice of words) and characters into the plot. Overall a really entertaining series.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|I love the show and it so goes along with it but it's also another side and that side is what castle wishes would happen
B003ZDZ1WG|1.0|A collection of whiny immature spoiled brat victim songs by a band with some musical potential.<br />They should get out of the 7th grade and listen to words from other similar bands like Lady A to find a new direction.
B000002O1Q|5.0|I have always loved this soundtrack. Unfortunately, my cassette tape just didn't translate well to mp3. So I bought this and got not only the CD but the mp3s (without need to convert). The soundtrack features two Jim Steinman (Meatloat's collaborator on Bat Out of Hell) songs as well as Ry Cooder, Stevie Nicks and Dan Hartman, among others. It definitely has its Wagnerian overtones, but I find it to be great fun.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|I used this during a power outage. The light was really very powerful and bright. Since I wasn't at home, it came in handy.
B000000XB8|5.0|Nice pressing, no extraneous noise, totally black in quiet areas.Sounds just like it did back in the early '70s.  No over production...sounds raw, rough and real.  This is music!
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Denzel Washington has always been one of my favorite actors, but in this movie, he plumbs the depths of his soul as a pilot who struggles to come to terms with the ravages vs the temptations of addiction, even in the face of terrible consequences.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is one game I return to over and over .It never disappoints and never seems to repeat a hand
B00AECGQF2|5.0|This game is so fun and so if you like to do<br />People's hair you should get this but like when you wash it mesis it up
B00200K2UG|5.0|As I write this I have just packed the Ultra Pro with 3 nikon bodies, 4 lens, flash, extra memory cards and there is<br />room to spare. The only thing needed with this bag are wheels as it is heavy if you fully pack it. But if you want<br />a bag to carry all your stuff including a laptop this would be it.
B005FISBTO|5.0|It's Dexter, what can I say.... it's all great. Michael C Hall is brilliant, I only wish there were more of him!!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|i really love this book it is a wonderful story and a definate page turner i cant wait for the movie to follow
B0072KZ0Z6|5.0|This is such a fun-to-watch show.  Great chemistry among the actors, always a laugh, but you also are really rooting for them as they struggle to find their adult selves.  This set includes funny outtakes, extended/deleted scenes, and other vignettes (my favorite is about &#34;How to Dress Jess&#34;).  Best, you get to re-watch the episode called &#34;Normal&#34; where they (somewhat) teach you the rules for playing True American.  Good stuff.
034580404X|5.0|these books might just be the fastest books i have ever read in my life i couldnt wait to see what happend next
0805053883|3.0|After my son became infatuated with [[ASIN:0805092447 Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See? My First Reader]], I decided to buy this book as well as the [[ASIN:0805092919 Baby Bear, Baby Bear, What Do You See? (My First Reader)]] and [[ASIN:0805092927 Panda Bear, Panda Bear, What Do You See? (My First Reader)]]. None of these books quite measure up to the original though.<br /><br />What is nice is they offer alternatives to the animals that you normally encounter in children's books (cat/dog/bird, farm animals, forest creatures). However, it is just nowhere near as engaging as Brown Bear, Brown Bear, at least for us.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|i ordered this book immediately after reading the first 2 and i enjoyed it as well a page turm=ner and a good way to spen a rainy or a lazy day
0698116496|5.0|One thing I love about this book is there are no words, just pictures. This allows you to be creative and make up your own story as you go along (though by now mine is memorized and stays the same each time). My son (now 17 months) adores the book. We got it for him when he turned 1 and he quickly started to say \\"Gorilla\\" to indicate that he wanted us to read it. He has since learned to identify all the animals, how to roar like a lion, and can identify different things like keys, banana, zookeeper, the zoo itself, etc. He's simply infatuated with this book and I hope it stays that way for a long time.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Oh my!  What a fabulous story and I could not put the book down!!!  Kudos to you!!!  I will be reading more of her stories!!
0689835604|4.0|When I first got this for my son (~1 yr), he wasn't super interested in it. He loves lift a flap books, but he would quickly skim through it and toss it aside.<br /><br />However, now at 17 months he can identify all his body parts and loves to look through and do the same with the babies in the book. When we get to the belly button page, he basically falls over trying to get a good look at his own belly button.<br /><br />While this isn't my favorite book, he seems to enjoy it very much so I would recommend it for children ~1 year old.
B005LAIISA|5.0|This was such a great gift for my granddaughter!  Ice Age is perfect and of course scrat is just the best!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|The book was amazing! It had me hanging on the edge of my seat! Loved it! The end was not what I expected!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|what is so bad you don't get to choose your horse you have to get diamonds to get a new horse YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO CHOOSE A HORSE
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Love the sequel! The zip lines are by far my fav addition to the game. The graphics are awesome... There is just one problem I'm having... I cant get over 3000 coins. One minute I will have 2,980 then when I run again I'm down to 484. Gonna try to reinstall and see if that helps ^.^
B004EPYZSK|1.0|You have to be Daft to order this movie!  Half of it is too dark to see what is going on.  You have to get midway through before the plot really becomes understandable at all.  There was NO need for letterbox, and had I known this I would NEVER have ordered it - it was not a Lawrence of Arabia, for God's sake!<br />Ford and Craig must be desperate for roles.  I never like Craig as 007, can never take the place of Sean Connery, Timothy Dalton or Pierce Brosnan, but I blame this movie's lack of good direction on the Director, and the dark recordings on Dreamworks and Universal.  After Craig was half-way acceptable in Casino and Quantum (007), he is just barely acceptable here.  And Ford, after those Marvelous Indiana Jones movies is really having to stretch here.  Both of their acting does neither any credit.  If you want a good ALIEN movie, a BELIEVABLE one, buy Alien and Aliens with Sigoourney  Weaver.  At least you can see most of those and they are beLIEVable.<br />Cecy Ivie
B004ZWKWQQ|5.0|This was the best price my son had a blast during Christmas building it<br />The package it came in was great packed very nice no problems
B0063IH60K|3.0|I enjoyed playing the game but I was disappointed with the difficulty it presented with moving the cards from one place to another.
B009CCBCU4|5.0|An amazing story set in a time period that is filled with mystery and mystique. She captures the essence of the period well, while keeping the story fresh and moving. Character development was amazing; by the end of the book I felt like I could write a biography on each of the characters she presented to us. Highly recommended book, and I am already enjoying the second book of this series.
B0095P3ULC|5.0|Although I have seen this movie several times, watching it again on Amazon, the viewing quality was very good....HD was actually flawless, with no gitters.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|The perspective of the dog is very interesting. A sad but sweet story about the devotion between pet and owner.
B0024Y9EYS|4.0|Its a very good mini series, some jerking in the quality but still haven't finished viewing yet. Depending on my finish, rating may change.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Great game! it will help you pass time and you have fun while playing this game. It's safe for all ages. I think this game is great I love to play it.
0385474547|4.0|Achebe's Things Fall Apart read and feels different in so many ways. The novel is effectively split into two halves, the first telling the life story of Okonkwo, the hero, in a traditional rural setting, and the second describing his village and clan's tribulations as the white man appears. The book reads at first quite differently from a novel, more like a loosely connected connection of tales, an epic interspersed with essential family history. Okonkwo, from modest origins, has risen to become a successful farmer, fighter, and a peer of his clan. His preoccupations are woven into village custom, traditional law, and religion. His story is one of everyday lore mixed in with the requisite homage to the supernatural. Then, in the novel's second part, the colonist arrives: missionary, policeman, judge. Okonkwo's world is irredeemable upset as its structures, its economy, and its very beliefs fall to the blows of superior force. Everything begins to fall apart. And the story, told from the point of view of the Africans, remains forever poignant, the irruption of unforgiving modernity among its unsuspecting victims forever incomprehensible. Eminently accessible, this is a compelling, wrenching read.
0792839749|5.0|Awesome! I got this for my mom. She absolutely loves this movie. Look forward to buying some more movies that I know she'll enjoy.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I think that this game is amazing, great graphics, realistic, and overall fun, whether your a horse lover or not!
0812550706|3.0|I did enjoy the book. It was well written but seemed to repeat the same theme over and over. It had some interesting ideas but lacked a sense of building to a climax. No suspense. Overall, it is O.K.
B006VGGAC4|5.0|Much more than meets the eye.<br />Amazing Drive. Inspired me to try to do better.<br />Especially the quote that he went to competitions to win and not to compete!<br />Highly recommended.
B0099Y2YL6|4.0|My wife and I both enjoy the TV broadcast and the DVD. However, we both noted in the 4th or 5th episode of the DVD there were several scenes left out. Why this was PBS couldn't or wouldn't tell us.
B0000AQS6R|5.0|The best Christmas movei of all time!<br />Chevy Chase and Family plan a wonderful down home Christmas, but<br />if you have even seen a Chevy Chase movie... This is not happening.<br />Get your popcorn ready!!<br />Love it!!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This was a great book.  It is not my usual read but I heard an interview Dr Eben Alexander had on the radio and I was intrigued.  Knowing that he is in the medical profession and actually brushed off NDE before, made me want to read it.  It was actually quite comforting.  Highly encourage doubters to read it.
B0057UA4FY|5.0|Great buy, great collection.<br />This was purchased with the season 1 and 3, to have all them together.<br />good deal!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|learned and enjoyed and characters made history come to life for this history b.a. ... intriguing but not so heavily plotted that you get lost like in a Russian novel ... a great read
B0040IAZVM|5.0|Perfect, thank you.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|great continuation of the last century series, like the twists and turns, hard to put down, great read for vacation or winter blues
B0001I561E|5.0|I saw this movie with my parents when I was 7 years old and instantly loved it.  As an adult it brings back fond memories of childhood and a strong sense of nostalgia.  The DVD arrived promptly and in the exact condition described.  A+
B00AGH7K7I|5.0|We liked his better than the first one, because of the uniqueness of NYC, the hotel scenes and the bird lady and the toy owner.
B006H5120E|5.0|I enjoyed the movie very much, especially that it was in 3D which was my reason for purchasing it.  I look<br />forward to watching it again from time to time.  The movie was titled &#34;Titanic&#34;  The other books purchased<br />were gifts and I have no way of knowing how well they were receivedc.
B007REV4YI|5.0|LOVED this, but I like James Bond movies. This one was really good though. Saw it at theater and looking forward to seeing it again to catch things I missed the first time around.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love this game, and play it all the time.  Great for passing the time away while sitting in a waiting room.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game is too much fun not to have.  I haven't had any problems with the App at all.  A challenging game for sure, but it is fun and funny. I had to go online to find out what each bird does but that was not an issue.
B00AYB0SX4|4.0|WORTH THE WATCH!!! wow. what a great story. i love horror/suspense movies but i was completely blown away by this ending.
B00005UKKF|5.0|Possibly her best concert EVER! My son & I watched this every day last summer =) He can get down for a 3yr old =)
B008IBPMZG|5.0|This is one of the finest shows to ever be on television! Worth the time to see all the seasons
B000002KK2|5.0|Her early work was so strong. Her raspy voice is so rich. Her soft tone make you long for more.
0618526412|5.0|Carson McCullers is proof positive that a writer can produce an important, enduring book without innovative use of language or narrative structure, without waxing especially eloquent in descriptive passages, without sparkling dialogue or an intricate plot. McCullers tells her story simply, with understanding and compassion for the loneliness in all of us.<br /><br />The pivotal character, around whom all the others circle, is Singer, a deaf mute who can communicate in sign, but who also reads lips and writes notes to communicate with the hearing world. The novel tells the stories of four searchers for meaning and beauty who are drawn to him because he \\"listens\\" and seems to be the one person who really understands them. Blount is a wanderer and a hard drinker, passionate about the inequality in America between the rich and the poor, convinced that a revolution must occur but unable to convince anyone to act. Doctor Copeland is a black physician who has spent his life trying to educate his people and convince them to seek equality with the white world, only to find his message falling on \\"deaf\\" ears, even in his own family. Mick is a young girl on the cusp of womanhood, who is obsessed with classical music and the desire to achieve something with her life, far away from the struggle against poverty of her family. Biff Brannon is the owner of the cafe where Singer eats, who is searching for love and beauty in his life. As for Singer, he \\"listens\\" to his new friends, but he longs for his old friend, Antonapoulos, another deaf mute, who has been sent by his family to a mental hospital. Only to Antonapoulos can Singer communicate his hopes and longings, even though his friend may not even understand what he is signing.<br /><br />McCullers' writing style is very calm and the action is slow, so that when terrible, violent events happen, they come as a complete surprise (as they do in real life). The reader is \\"struck speechless.\\"<br /><br />I suppose this could be viewedas a very depressing book, yet it ends with a hint of hope--not that the characters will achieve their dreams but that they will at least keep trying.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Thanks that was a really good book :)<br />Bylylah Miguel so that is all I have to say good bye
B009UX2YAC|5.0|So addictive. There is nothing like it. I can't seem to put it down. This is a must have. Believe me
B004YM6JI2|5.0|This is a must to complete my seasons. As with all my other dvd's I am sure I will enjoy it.
B0011CWWXO|5.0|I purchased this because of another review that listed other better cellists.  It was a random choice and I am happily well pleased and if that is a redundant use of words so is my pleasure stacking high. I am pretty sure that I enjoy listening to this more than my Casals or Yoyo Ma but there is a season for everything, right now  this rich and melodic recording showing off some gripping resinous bow action that enters my torso chakras and soothes my soul is my one and only.  Love.<br /><br />Buy this album if only to have somebody to sleep with. Mind you you'll be married by morning. (This is the way things happen in heaven.)
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I find that the plot is complex, characters can grow and develop, and issues are real but the rating system stinks.
B0007MWZEK|1.0|The first day I used it the plastic covering broke I don't recommend this to anyone I had one before and I did not have a problem with it. But this one doesn't seem as sturdy as the last.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|THis was wonderful.  I purchased this to watch on the train and it was wonderful being entertained on the train.
B00846F1YW|5.0|This is best hidden object game I ever played. There is a wide variety of games and there is a fun story to follow. The graphics are amazing, and u can zoom in prior easily by pinching the screen. Awesome!

B008YWY0HK|3.0|I loved the state of the art animation, and I liked the image of a strong, independent young woman maximizing her pure potentiality.<br /><br />I experienced great difficulty accepting the transformation of her mother into a bear.  That just didn't work for me.  Maybe my reaction is an individual anomaly.  I hope so.<br /><br />Overall, it was definitely a film worth watching.  I believe I would recommend it to adults with some reservations.  Small children might not even blink at that ursine metamorphosis.

B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I don't know why the original cable simply rotted! and I didn't like having to buy a new one when the original simply deteriorated.  I thought the company should have replaced the original because it was somehow deficient.  I had to buy a new one and pay for the shippping charge, which was almost as much as the product.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is great its super addicting and a time waster for those board moments.the graphics are so much better than the last temple run. I love how u can collect diomends throught the game that can save u when u need them. the money is is good u don't get it to fast or to slow the only thing I don't like is sometimes it glitches and u die when ur not supposed to and that's really annoying but maybe its just my device well overall its great! !!!!

B004RZGUBM|5.0|The Delphi edition of Dickens illustrates that when you get it right, e-books are invaluable. If you're a Dickens fan, this is a feast. Everything of Dickens that you ever wanted to read and probably some that you didn't is here. The Forster biography is one of the surprises that's included. This biography by one of Dickens' friends is worth the cost of the set. It's often difficult to find and expensive when you do. The illustrations are also a bonus, bringing additional life to the novels. This is one edition of Dickens that won't just have \\"shelf\\" life is my library. The Delphi edition is a delight for Dickens' fans and it will surely gain some new ones as well. Couldn't ask for more. Economical in cost, but valuable to have available on your Kindle.

B00A655N8I|3.0|Unfortunately I must agree with the previous reviewer. This is some of the most inert Wagner conducting I've heard.  Gergiev is a mystery to me. I've heard him conduct Wagner brilliantly at the MET in recent years (Flying Dutchman and Parsifal) and yet so many of his recordings, even those taken from live performances, have a slack and lifeless quality, with a premium seemingly placed on sheer refinement of the orchestral sound.  These qualities are, alas, also present in this Walküre recording.  The final scene between Brünnhilde and Wotan in Act III just goes for nothing--a big dramatic blank. Beautiful playing by the orchestra but where is the drama, the intensity, or any actual shaping or phrasing of the music?  It's made all the more frustrating because Gergiev has assembled the best possible cast from today's singers.  With Kaufmann, Stemme, and Pape, in particular, there's more consistently gorgeous vocalism on this Walküre than any since Karajan's (Crespin, Janowitz, Vickers, Stewart).  And yet, their performances are undermined by Gergiev's conducting.  One needn't even go back as far as Furtwängler, Krauss, Knappertsbusch, or Keilberth to see what is missing here--even James Levine's conducting in his circa 1990 cycle is much more dramatic and powerful than Gergiev's (although not particularly distinctive on its own terms and with a more erratic cast). All the beautiful singing goes for naught when the conducting has as little purpose and tension as it does here.  I was so looking forward to this recording, so perhaps my heightened expectations have led me to be unduly harsh.  There's certainly many lovely things in this recording, but, in a sense, it entirely misses the point.  Not an auspicious start to this cycle, I'm afraid.
B00479SVBU|5.0|I gave this to a good friend as a gift. he is &#34;tech challenged&#34;, does not even own a computer or smart phone. He Loves This!!! it is super easy to use, I gave him a loaded SD Card, and other friends have added to it for him. he takes it everywhere! his only complaint was he could not figure out a way to keep from losing the little remote control, which he promptly lost the first day. he found it couple days later. :)<br />I kind of wish I'd got one for myself. tho I can see where the little more  expensive one that can broadcast Bluetooth would be nice. this one, if your phone has an fm radio (his does), you can still listen with your Bluetooth headset. :) my friend bought a wall plug-in adapter for the car charger and listens at home thru his home stereo.

B002RI9ZPY|3.0|Slow to start and much repetition of previous books in the series.Very active in the middle and slow again building to a dramatic finish.
0062127241|3.0|Okay, let me state first and foremost that I am a lifelong acolyte of Pete Townshend. The Who were always and still are my favorite band of all time. As a songwriter I believe Townshend holds his own with nearly all of this 60s/70s counterparts and as a rhythm guitarist I'll take him over Keith Richards anytime. I have every single Who album, a bunch of bootlegs, every one of his solo albums and a whole library of Who-and-Townshend related books, magazines, and other paraphenalia. In fact, Townshend's life has been so well documented over the years, through numerous interviews and the hundreds of self-absorbed articles and blog entries he's written over the years, that Who fans probably know more about his life than they do about most other rock musicians.<br /><br />So, what Who and Townshend fans would have expected from his own autobiography is a well-thought out, well written tome that is as deep and revealing as the man himself, offering insights into what makes--and made--him him tick. Most of all, we'd expect discussions about the meaning and construction of individual songs, and to shed light on many of the myths that have grown around the man and the band.<br /><br />In spite of the fact that Townshend claims he was working on this for years, what we get instead is a rushed, poorly organized, and frustrating \\"tell-all\\" that spends far too much time focusing on the yawn-inducing sex-drugs-wealth stuff most Who fans don't care all that much about, and precious little discussion of his amazing musical legacy.<br /><br />He starts off by setting himself up as a possible victim of sexual abuse, suggesting that the details will be revealed later, and carries this as a theme throughout the work. Yet, except for one incident, he never fully discloses the details that support his repeated claim that he was victimized during the time he spent with his scary grandmother. Not that we necessarily need the sordid details, but a simple sentence that said, \\"After years oftherapy, blocked memories were revealed of many instances of sexual abuse during this time, all of which are too painful for me to recount in print.\\" As readers, we would have forgiven him for not going into details. Instead, he uses this as an excuse for explaining much of his reprehensible behavior over the years.<br /><br />The only place in the book where this repeated abuse leitmotif resonates is in his interpretation of the real meaning of \\"A Quick One,\\" which he claims was his subconscious recounting of these memories. It may be the best part of the book; unfortunately, he doesn't go to this level of analysis with any other song, either in terms of lyrical content or in terms of how the finished recordings were created.<br /><br />Considering how many myths have grown around these recordings, it's a shame that Townshend doesn't address them. For example, other books have revealed that the lyrics to \\"Baba O'Riley\\" were throwaway working lyrics that Townshend never bothered to update in the final recording. He also missed the opportunity to finally confirm or dispel the story that the opening riff og Baba O'Riley was created by a Lowry organ, rather than a Moog or ARP synthesizer. Niggling details only Who fans would be interested in, but we are the primary consumers of the book, aren't we?<br /><br />Not only does Townshend not discuss songs in detail, he also ignores huge chunks of his seminal work. After a decent discussion of \\"Can't Explain,\\" he does straight to \\"My Generation\\" while totally skipping the Who's second single, \\"Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere,\\" which, while not a particularly great song, was the first single to prominently feature an extended section of feedback that came to full fruition on \\"My Generation.\\"  He offers no discussion of the Who's classic first album and in general barely discussions of album tracks that weren't singles. Here are there he puts some issues to rest--for example, finally clearing up the ages-old debate over the identifyof \\"Lily\\" in \\"Pictures of Lily\\" (it was Lily Langtry, not Lillian Baylis), and confirming what's been rumored for years (that Townshend wrote \\"Pinball Wizard\\" to bribe Nik Cohn into giving \\"Tommy\\" a great review even before Cohn had heard the album).<br /><br />He doesn't mention the \\"Odds and Sods\\" compilation at all (in spite of it containing a number of great songs) and barely touches upon the Who's post-Quadrophenia work, instead spending an inordinate amount of time recounting this struggles with the Tommy movie and soundtrack (who cares?), and far too much time discussing his lesser, later solo works such as \\"The Iron Man\\" and \\"Psychoderilect.\\"<br /><br />But Townshend also perpetuates myths that have long been discredited. For example, he re-tells the whole \\"Keith Moon driving a Rolls into a Holiday Inn pool\\" story which has been cemented in Who lore for decades. Over the years, other books (particularly Tony Fletcher's excellent, non-fanboy biography of Moon) have clearly shown this story to a myth perpetuated by the band.<br /><br />Other stories are just plain wrong. For example, near the end he talks giving a legendary Gibson given to him by Joe Walsh for a charity auction. Earlier in the book had mentioned breaking a guitar given to him by Walsh on a TV show in the mid 70s. Most Who fans know that this particular guitar was an orange Gretsch '59 Chet Atkins that Townshend used for most of the rhythm guitar parts on \\"Who's Next\\" and \\"Quadrophenia.\\" Now, perhaps Walsh also gave him a Gibson at one point and that's the guitar Townshend auctioned off, but to me it seems that Townshend forgot the brand of the guitar.<br /><br />He also seems to suggest that John Entwistle played on the Who's 2004 \\"new song\\" \\"Real Good Looking Boy.\\" Entwistle died in 2002, and in the video \\"documentary\\" of the making of the song it's clear that Greg Lake is the bassist.<br /><br />Omissions, errors and myth-perpetuators like these are scatted like mines through the books. It almost seems that Townshend has forgotten many events of this life and relied on archived sources to fill in the details, many of them incorrect. Had it been edited by a true Who fan, some of these would have been caught. A good editor would have also cajoled Townshend into spending less time talking about all the boats and houses and groupies he acquired and more time revealing the mechanics of his songwriting. It's also far too short. Keith Richards' autobiography is over 500 pages long and none of it is dull. Most Who fans would have appreciated another couple hundred pages from Townshend, particularly if there were less \\"rock star\\" confessions and more \\"songwriter\\" content.<br /><br />And, unlike Richards' autobiography, which was charmingly written, often hilarious, and revealed many details about the man--including the drugs and sex stuff--in a way that made you think of the Stones' guitarist as something other than the skeletal inspiration for Johnny Depp's Caribbean pirate--the Townshend off \\"Who I Am\\" comes off as a thoughtless, selfish, immature and totally unlovable person whose only true love is his mythical self.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Really good graphics. I wish you could just enter competitions without having to train your horse. But still is a good game
B003O86FMW|4.0|This book was way better than the first, the story took an unexpected turn of events that I absolutely like.  It's a great thing when you are so surprised of the turn of events.  That's why I can't put the book down, I just want to keep reading and reading until the end.

B00BC5FN2C|5.0|The Netflix original series \\"House of Cards\\" features some extraordinary performances from well-established actors, as well as a well-written script and smooth and competent direction.  The real star of the series though is raw naked ambition, and how it infests and steers the lives and thoughts of the three main characters:  husband-and-wife and partners-for-power Congressman Francis Underwood (Kevin Spacey) and environmental NGO head Claire (Robin Wright), and cub political reporter Zoe Barnes (Kate Mara).  In their own pursuit of power and glory, the lives of these three individuals inevitably become entangled, snaring those who unfortunate enough to be in their way or silly enough to want to be in their way.<br /><br />Of all the characters, Congressman Francis Underwood has turned the pursuit of power into his own personal religion.  The series starts off with a newly elected president denying Underwood the position of Secretary of State, which motivates Underwood to dream and scheme for a higher position.  Throughout the first season's 13 episodes he relentlessly pursues his ambition.<br /><br />That is not true of his wife though.  Claire is supposed to be his husband's true and faithful partner, and in one revealing scene she confronts a man who has always hated Francis Underwood for corrupting her.  Claire then explains that she chose Francis because he could see her for her true nature, but the explanation is so violent that we as viewers must think she only says this to mask to herself her grave doubts about the grave she and her husband are digging for themselves.  Indeed, throughout the series, while Francis is energized (buying a rowing machine and eating salads for lunch, as a consequence) by the political intrigue that he has unleashed, Claire becomes burdened by a weary festering but ultimately fettered conscience.<br /><br />\\"House of Cards\\" is a political thriller with a not particularly interesting plot.  What redeems it is its attention to detail, to nuance, and to subtlety, and the decision of the directors and producers to portray political power as honestly as mass television would permit.  It seems that everyone is tainted and corrupted by power so that redemption is never a possibility in \\"House of Cards.\\"  The series also makes we viewers the personal confidante of Francis Underwood so that now and then he turns to us, winks at us, and tells us how the game is really played in Washington.  In this way, we're tainted and corrupted as well.<br /><br />\\"House of Cards\\" is supposedly based on the British novel and the BBC mini-series, but I suspect that the series' real inspiration and source material is Robert Caro's biography of Lyndon Baines Johnson's path to power.  Like Johnson, Underwood is a Southerner with a gift for gab, for telling stories, for understanding the minute mechanisms of Congress, for reading people, and ultimately for corrupting people.<br /><br />A lot of viewers will think \\"House of Cards\\" too cynical, but I think it's too naive.  In real world politics, every politician has the ambition and amorality of Francis Underwood, but in real world politics no politician has his cunning and strategy.  Evil may be banal, but it's also stupid, crass, and lazy.<br /><br />\\"House of Cards\\" doesn't rise to the same genius as \\"The Wire,\\" but in many ways \\"House of Cards\\" is far more entertaining and relevant.

B0051BNRTO|3.0|Annie, a middle-aged Englishwoman whose Tucker Crowe-obsessed academic boyfriend of sixteen years has just left her for another woman, strikes up an unlikely correspondence with Tucker Crowe, a former songwriter-singer who just happens the favorite projection of women's dreams and fantasies, and as such has seeded at least four of them (to his knowledge).  As his last relationship is about to fall apart, Crowe visits Annie in England.<br /><br />That essentially is the lame and shallow plot of \\"Juliet, Naked,\\" and it's an awfully long and boring read.<br /><br />I became interested in Nick Hornby's fiction because I read his \\"About a Boy,\\" which in its story of how a bunch of weird but winning characters came to discover each other spoke poignantly about the human condition.  I suppose \\"Juliet, Naked\\" tries to capture again \\"About a Boy\\"'s existentialist angst, but it doesn't succeed because the main characters are weird but they're not winning -- in fact, they're just usually whining and complaining all the time.<br /><br />And since we're all experts at whining and complaining ourselves, who really wants to hear others whine and complain?
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|read it it the best of the best read it read it you won't regret getting this fantastic book .
1573225517|3.0|While Nick Hornby is often a funny and concise writer, it was really difficult for me to like reading \\"High Fidelity.\\"  That's because the protagonist is a 36-year old proprietor of a record store who truly excels at whining, being a selfish jerk, and basically acting like a sixteen-year old.  His girlfriend dumps him, so he promptly sleeps with a hot singer and when that doesn't satisfy him he begins stalking his girlfriend.  And when his girlfriend decides that life is too hard as it is and she doesn't want to start over again all he wants to know is how good her sex life was during their separation.  There really isn't much to like about him at all, and when it's entirely clear that he'll never be punished for his bad behavior I found there wasn't much to like about this book as well.<br /><br />Honestly, who reads and enjoys this crap?

B007FEFLTO|4.0|I had read the first book of the trilogy, Fall of Giants, and was looking forward to the second book for the last 2 years. It lived to my expectations and was a good read. I liked the in depth stories of the characters from the first book continuing in to the next decades and generations. I found after reading the book, I went on to read the non-fiction, Bonhoeffer: Pastor, Martyr, Prophet, Spy about German resistance in WWII and found that Winter of the World was very accurate and well researched giving me a new outlook on the WWII. I'd highly recommend it and am looking forward to the third book in the trilogy.

0345803485|1.0|A second grader could probably write a better story than Fifty Shades. I was expecting a thriller and instead found complete garbage. I didn't even get halfway through the book. Please don't waste your money or time buying this book. It's very poorly written, the characters and plot are so bland and the whole idea is completely unrealistic. I wish I could give it zero stars because that's what it really deserves.

B00846F1YW|2.0|I got this game because it was free. And I don't care what the storyline says it is, this game is about helping a town full of hoarders find various items that they can't because of the state their mental condition has left their personal well as business quarters. Also, something about fake art and bombs.<br /><br />Game play, even when &quot;challenging&quot;, was laughably easy. Even when I failed to find something in time (mainly because i had stopped caring and therefore was not trying), just neatly put everything back and made the follow up play through a game of &quot;hey remember where all this junk was before? Click it again.&quot;. Even the other &quot;puzzle solving&quot; mini games meant to give you a break from puzzle from object finding were easier than the main game and not much of a break from the monotony.<br /><br />I got it when it was the app of the day and I'm glad. This game at $2.99 is a waste of money. Even free it's a waste of money. (Yeah, you figure that one out.)

0307895475|2.0|Not what I expected. A lot of information but very condensed in format. What I really wanted was a walkthrough version of the game. I was able to get more detailed information from websites of other players. Maybe this book would be helpful to a more experienced game player but I found it too complicated and difficult to follow. I'm also finding out that the game has bugs and some info in the book is wrong. Not happy about that and have had to start the game over several times trying different characters but still not able to complete some quests. Very frustrating after hours of play.

B005LAIH2W|4.0|I first read \\"A Princess of Mars\\" before I was 10, well over fifty years ago, and I was immediately hooked on Burroughs although, strangely enough, I never got into the Tarzan stories. It didn't take me long to acquire my first set of the ERB Mars novels and I've read them over and over and over and . . .  The prize of my 800 or so volume collection of fantasy, horror and SF books is a set of the ERB Mars novels with the Frank Frazetta dust covers. I waited all these years for someone to make a passable movie of the John Carter saga and that's what this one is - a passable presentation of the Carter saga.  Why someone feels determined to rewrite the classic Burroughs story is completely beyond me. The original in all its grandeur is pretty much beyond surpassing but the screenwriter (as almost every modern screenwriter does) feels they can improve an original that has withstood almost one hundred years of readers.  Here's what I thought was good and not so good -<br /><br />The opening scenery with its introduction to John Carter was pretty well done.  Although it didn't strictly follow ERB's script, it was close enough for the viewer to get the same idea as to where John Carter came from. The opening scenes with the Tharks were really well done although I've always pictured the Tharks as a little beefier. The dead sea bottoms and the deserted cities were exceptionally well done and the presentation of Woola was priceless - brought tears to my jaundiced eye.  Those who never read the John Carter stories can't recognize that the meeting of John Carter and Woola is every bit as portentious as the first meeting of Spock and Kirk, Holmes and Watson, Morse and Lewis, and even Tarzan and Jane.  As a rule the scene was very well set in the beginning.<br /><br />But then we depart from Burroughs' original plot line and the story starts to lose its original coherence.  The Therns appear out of nowhere with very little introduction of what their place is in Martian society. Tardos Mors and Mors Kajak were given just enough screen time for the non-afficianado to wonder just who they were. The atmosphere plant scenes were pretty much left out - interestingly enough, these were about the only passable scenes in an otherwise disaster of a predecessor production. Whine, whine, whine.<br /><br />The really sad part of this whole thing is that from such a promising first hour or so, the movie died when they left the original story plot.  If they had just stuck with Burroughs' original, they could have stretched this into three or four really block-buster movies (as was done with the Lord of the Rings trilogy recently).  As for poor, pitiful me (and all the other original John Carter fans) we'll have to wait another ten to twenty years (if we live that long) to see if someone attempts to bring this truly classic story out of the rubble that it's now in and do it right.  I gave it four stars mostly because it's the best attempt yet at telling Burroughs' story and I think I'm rating the original novels more than the movie.

B00B5HQLMI|4.0|This Bond film continues a great series. No disappointments. Good story line, editing is good as well, and and as any Bond film, it just keeps coming at you. Golly good show!
B003EGMDP2|5.0|Embraced is by far my all-time favorite book. Betty's recollection of her NDE is full of vivid detail; and the message she conveys is one of hope and love. From someone who is not a religious person, Embraced By The Light is truly a remarkable book.
B0028IDXDS|1.0|The picture looks nothing like the actual product. It was small & very cheap. The little monkey was ugly and not even close to the picture. I'm returning it ASAP
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book must have been written by a silly 16 year old girl. The author does an excellent job describing every minor detail yet forgets to actually develop a compelling story. This book is made for under-sexed, simple-minded people and I'm sad that I wasted my time and money trying to find out &#34;what all the hype was about&#34; regarding this silly silly book
B007XHWROK|4.0|My daughter loves it she listens to it every day. It came fast in the mail and in good shape
B0037AGASG|5.0|I am very impressed with this album by far. It is even better than his My World album. It has songs we all know, and, love as Justin Bieber fans. My all time favorite song from this album is,\\"Baby.\\" It has a catchy chorus. I would recommend this album to any new Justin fan, or, one that does not have this album already.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This is a great book if you are looking for a quick, entertaining read.  It kept me interested and there were a couple of turns in the story that were unexpected.
B001EBWITA|5.0|I love this movie.  I've seen this movie over 20 times and still enjoy it each time I see it.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I loved the book as I was reading it, and kept thinking, &#34;this is a GREAT book!&#34;, that is until the end.  It seemed like it just ended with out wrapping anything up.  Overall I would definitely recommend this book, just disappointed in the ending.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Absorbing, intelligent! Had me running to my computer to research alchemy and to find the images referred to in the book. So anxious to begin the next book.
B003MC5N28|5.0|This book is good for pre-teens. My son and I really enjoyed reading this book. It open kids mind to how the wworld if everyone
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Very good game lots to do and keeps me interested. Something is wrong with the bowling alley. Sometimes if pulled down too far on the screen it gets stuck. I like that you don't have to buy acorns or coins if yow don't want to.
1451695195|5.0|Very well written, informative and convincing. I have had a sense that the &#34;other side&#34; is somewhat how Eben describes it, now he confirmed it for me.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|If you are Alien fan, this quad-set is probably the best collection. It contains theatical and special versions of each of the 4 movies. Bonus features contain behind the scenes materials and tons of interviews with actors. My favorite interview is probably with Carrie Henn and her brother.  If you don't mind them being DVD, then this Alien set is perfect for you.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|There was a lot of placement descriptions and telling of the significance of events and emotions. It was a good read but you kind of get tired of the many descriptions of hands caressing faces arms wrapping around. Less could have been used to create the image, but it was a good read. Somethings tied up too neatly and I wanted to see some of the mess, but interesting subject matter.
B00846F1YW|5.0|I enjoy the object finds. This is better than a small ds gaming system. I can see this much better.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Es una obra llena de emoci&oacute;n,acci&oacute;n,romance,tambi&eacute;n tiene un toque de intriga por lo que mantiene el inter&eacute;s del lector en todo momento. Lo recomiendo a adultos y adolescentes.
B007K3JCAE|3.0|the movie was in its original plastic but the disc wasnt secured on the inside and the outside cardboard package was all crushed in on the edges. i havent tried to watch the movie yet but if it doesnt work ill definitely be returning it.
B00846F1YW|5.0|great graphics and engaging story line. would like to be able zoom, but can survive without it. load time is Good and does not Nag you for a review.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Was a great book to read has a different twist to other sparks books, I am anxious to see the upcoming movie.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|love the walking dead so i had to get up to date before the mid season premier on feb 10
B005UPOAT2|5.0|I don't want to write a review.  Just saying everything is great blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah .
0062200909|5.0|Great book with great details.<br />Overall very good quality!<br />Must have for every Tolkien fan.<br />Can't wait for &#34;Desolation of Smaug&#34; edition.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Josh Groban... one of the world's most angelic, touching and ethereal voices does it again in this album. Buy it and fall in love with each and every song.
B00280LYIM|5.0|This series gets better with each book. Some of the secondary stories such as Pan come to a sad end, but it just makes me want to read the next one right now. And I can't wait until I do.a
B00991TCOG|5.0|Do not be fooled by appereances. This lady is a virtuoso of the violin, a terrific dancer and a great singer. Too much awesomeness into one person.
B007L3BMGA|3.0|Enjoyed the story line but got a bit over the the rest of the book. overall enjoyed it and ofcause I need to read the other books in the series.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|GREAT CD, loaded with all of her hit songs. Kelly Clarkson's cd has up to 20 songs on it. Great buy! Very popular music!  5 stars!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great book!!!!!!! Read it in two days.. i couldnt put it down. Would make a great movie if they decide to make one..
B00008973A|5.0|The music, by Marvin Hamlisch, is fantastic, and even more precious now that we have lost him, and the choregraphy was breathtaking.  There isn't anything I don't like about this movie, which I have watched several times. Michael Douglas gives his usual fine performance along with the rest of the cast.
0446580848|5.0|Great story as usual from DeMille. His characters are &#34;characters&#34;. And I learned that I do not want to visit Yemen ;)
B005P4PAVK|5.0|I have all the other seasons. I hate all the commercials when watching on the air. Love having the shows without commercials.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downton Abbey is riviting. The acting is superb, it is hard to pick one actor that stands out among this stellar cast. The writing is an art form unto itself. I am buying all the seasons so I can watch it again years down the road.
B00846F1YW|5.0|This game is fun; VERY challenging.  I love that you can skip the dialog. very enjoyable. You have to think like a young person to find some of the objects. Great hidden objects and the puzzles are fun too.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|all in one app for all documents.<br /><br />great for people whom use it for it intent.<br /><br />but for me, I don't have enough traffic in this world
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great character acting that enables the viewer to imagine herself/himself living in the waning years of the Victorian era. Each episode keeps you wanting more.
0743454537|1.0|The writer is trite, lazy, totally derivative and doesn't understand how a metaphor is supposed to work. I guess it's what's called a \\"beach book\\" or a plane book--because it's so entirely lacking in anything thought provoking it is best read someplace where your attention is going to be lacking. I think I sensed this would be the case when the cover's two rave reviews were from People and Entertainment Weekly.<br /><br />Anyway I finished it because I wanted to see how she'd end it. But, not caring anything about any of them, the ending couldn't affect me. Too bad, as the subject is certainly provocative.<br /><br />Funny thing is, because I read this long after the film came out (which I didn't see), my greatest enjoyment was picturing Alec Baldwin as the lawyer--and imagining him with the dog. That was fun.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|Very impressive. And very classy. When I have taken my Kindle with me to Dr visits etc people have commented that it looks like a small clutch purse.
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|This was a good action flick.  It kept my wife awake which is a test of whether it is interesting.  Although a little predictable, you might be surprised at the end.. and it does get a little weird.
B007REV4T8|3.0|Just to give a different perspective from all the 5 star rave reviews...there are a lot of good things about this movie (the cinematography is stunning, especially the scenes in Shanghai), but a lot of big disappointments. Frankly the worst thing is the overhyped performance by Javier Bardem as the villain, dull and boring!!! From the moment he appears onscreen, the movie drags to a long, drawn out conclusion. A movie worth seeing? Sure. The best Bond ever? Not even close!!! We missed all the clever high tech gadgets very much. And, without saying too much, Ralph Fiennes is no Judi Dench!!!
B00846F1YW|4.0|Wow! What a fun and challenging game. It was the app of the day. I'm having a blast and can't put it down :) So worth it and it's free woo hoo..
B006AX6ONI|5.0|Mark Cuban is a passionate leader and investor.  In this short book he outlines some of the key principles that got him to where he is today.  He was able to sustain a fundamentally informative tone while also injecting humorous experiences from his life.  Anyone interested in building their own business should consider reading this book and taking notes.  Although Cuban may not be not the final authority on business, it would be wrong to ignore the quality advice he outlines here.
B002ZG976U|5.0|I Absolutely love this movie. I kept catching it here and there on tv. Wanted to we whole thing, def worth the $
0425264351|5.0|As the author develops the persona of the character, it makes you wonder if this is going to be a book you are really interested in.  Trust me, you will be
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i love this app soo much!!  some games are kind of challenging but theyre still fun and addicting i know everyone can enjoy this
0515142247|5.0|Lee Child has established in just two books that he is an author to follow.  You will look for more Reacherbooks.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Can't put NS's books down once started, I read each of them in a day's time. At 70yrs old I've become a sentimental fool and NS's work makes me smile, laugh and CRY alot!!
B000NDETLK|1.0|I have no idea how this video was because it wouldn't play in any of the DVD players in America, where it was delivered. Really that should have been more evident upon ordering.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game and play it almost everyday but i think you guys should change the senary up  a bit because it gets boring after a while
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game its the best for me and it does not freeze for me! So whoever does not have this game GET IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B001QKSWOE|5.0|Love all her books, great story with so much humor, I'll sit down and read one of her books and find myself giggling out loud!
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Great show sad it did not last love the cast and music and overall the show.  Watching Nathan on Castle and seeing him on this show is great.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I have a machine that makes sounds and it 's ok. But these melodies are wonderful. You can add the sounds you like and stop the one that you just don't want to hear. I love the sound of the grandfather clock, it reminds me of the time as a little gir I would sleep over at my grandparents house. Please down load this, you will not be sorry.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great writing, great characters, and great actors!  From the teens to the roaring 20s and beyond!  Here's to hoping we make it to Downton Season 10!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This is a most see DVD for families with sons.  Questions such as How do I behave as a husband, father, friend are easily portrayed by realistic situations which confront basic human values.  It is realistic, compassionate and humorous.
B00846F1YW|5.0|I thought everyone should that this game is the bomb. I want to play it again and again. I love it so much.
B00B9366VO|5.0|This was a great documentary.  Love Dave and all the people he had contriubte was awesome.  Recommend to everyone.  Great!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I ejoyed this book, kept me on the edge of my seat. True to form by other works by Nicholas Sparks.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I long avoided this TV series assuming that it was just another re-hashed version of 'Day of the Living Dead'. Boy, was I wrong; however, I'm grateful I came late to watching 'The Walking Dead' because I was able to watch every show back-to-back avoiding the anxiety that comes from enduring its cliff hangers. And the show is filled with them, which of course, is a huge factor that draws its audience in. The show is richly multi-dimensional.  At one level, the zombie apocalypse functions as an allegory of the nature of life. In life, the best laid out plans are always shredded apart with the unexpected. In life, a seemingly innocuous event can cause you to completely abandon everything you spent considerable time developing. The zombies also serve as a dramatic devise that establishes the context and drives the real drama that unfolds between the human characters, which is the real reason you're compelled to watch. Though some of the characters are caricatures, they're not static. With every episode, for better or worse, people grow, change, and evolve.  Decisions, actions, mistakes all have consequences and the people of `The Walking Dead' become altered by them. And no one is safe from death.<br /><br />In season 3 Rick Grime's crew finds refuge in a prison but their newfound home is threatened by the leader of a near-by community, Woodbury. Desperation's grip tightens on everyone. Madness is not only the natural consequence, but the audience must consider if it's that's the sensible state for one to properly deal with the hungry flesh eating 'walkers'. At times the actors over-act their parts, and some of the overtly philosophical elements of the show can feel heavy handed, but this is one of the most intelligent, thrilling and entertaining TV shows out there.
B001AW156U|2.0|To start, it took for ever to get them, but that may or may not have been a fault of the postal system.<br /><br />As for the product, you get what you pay for, for sure! The triggers pop off VERY easily. Not ideal for intense gameplay. I would not recommend these.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This is a big upgrade from TR1 - much more difficult.  It will take much more time to get bored of this one.  Good job guys -
B00499QUK2|5.0|Would recommend this show to anyone who likes suspense and using their mind while watching a show. Very entertaining and engaging.
B009PXNFQE|5.0|P!nk has produced yet again another great album.  I love that you can see her personal life expressed through a number of the songs (or maybe even all of them).
B00A0HQ7H8|4.0|Paradise is an apt followup to Lana Del Rey's first release--as if they were recorded & meant to be heard together (hence the cover art echoes). This collection continues themes & attitudes that appeared earlier, however, here expanded upon & fleshed out fully. Many songs embrace self-destroying forbidden fruits & narratives of abjection. The musical production sometimes sounds frostily grand, and yet Lana successfully wrings art out of louche posturing. 90% of Paradise stays interesting & provocative. Worth every penny.
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|It is a pretty basic calculator, so for the price it is exactly what you would expect and need to have.
0756603749|5.0|I gave my copy away to my son.  I miss it every day!  This is one of the most complete, most practical, and most understandable books on knots that I've come across.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|Very hard to understand why Rodriguez was not pushed out in to the public more? He is Dylan, Donovan, and (older) Neil Diamond all in one.
B00899F0G8|5.0|This show is so good! Must watch from first season though. There are so many things going on, so many twists and turns it keeps the viewer interested. I look forward to the show all week long!.
0738212415|4.0|I've gone through most of the exercises in this book, and probably become a better artist as a result of it.  Kistler has a casual style which encourages you to go through step by step.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Fantastic book and ending.  Loved it and the other two. I told my son I would never read the Hungar Games, but now I am glad I did and glad I read all Three books.
B005LAII12|5.0|I put this movie in the more sophmoric humor category, and probably the best.  Don't get be wrong, The Hangover was hilarious, but this just edged it by a little bit.  Acting is great, directing is great (way to go, Seth!) and the writing is very funny.  It's a nice story, and though it's got a talking stuffed bear, the movie puts it as a novelty, then a normal thing.  You'll see.  Highly recommend.  Had me laughing out loud almost every time Ted spoke.  He pulls NO punches.  And Mark Wahlberg is brilliant working within the whole CGI/real life thing.
B006VA3ZEG|5.0|I very much enjoyed the first 2 seasons of Downton Abbey which I was able to stream for free with my Prime membership. I hope that Amazon will also offer season 3 for its Prime members.
B0072OFM28|5.0|I've seen (in chronological order) Gods of the Arena and Blood and Sand.  Both are very similiar in style and setting...one gets used to the small world of the ludus and the arena in Capua.  However this is much different as it's all around Capua with very little of the main characters in the ludus (no spoiler alert).  Seeing a different actor play Spartacus is a little hard at first, but you get used to it quick - Liam McIntyre is a pretty badass Spartacus.  Nothing against Andy Whitfield (B&S) - he was great, but unfortunately he died.  Literally.  Still a great cast, great production, great scenes!  Highly recommend the ENTIRE series, from Gods through the upcoming War of the Damned.  Starz did a GREAT job with this!<br />Still very violent and sexual.  Kinda miss some of the other characters...they were great.<br />Enjoy!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|It is a really fun game.  The only thing I do not like aabout it is that you need a certain number of points to complete the game and that makes it take forever.  Do not buy this game if you do not have much patience.  But overall it's a great game.
B000FC1HBY|1.0|I liked Book 1 of &#34;A Song of Ice and Fire&#34; a lot . This one was just tedious, with Ser this and Ser that. It lacked the human interest of the first one. This is reflected in the HBO series - Season 1 was much better than Season 2. However I was able to watch all of Season 2 but was unable to finish the book and put it down about two thirds of the way through.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|It's just great to have a show that isn't a drama series. The horror gore and blood reminds that their r other genres out their. N writers should continue to write more like this. Total genius.
B00A3OJBMG|5.0|Best series all around ,just watch 1st episode and You will be addict it to this show, very good casting,specialy Castiel, and Bob of course after Sam and Dean .
B00A80SHFM|5.0|The music and lyrics are fantastic. Who knew that Hugh Jackman had such a wonderful voice!!!!<br />I now wish I had made it to the movie, but I will definately get the DVD when it is released.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|Graphics are great, but on the kindle fire, the zoom barely works.  Most items in the h.o. games are still easy enough to see, but there are many that are still so tiny you will have to use the hint button repeatedly.  There are 8 chapters to the game, but the last chapter isn't playable, it's a cut-screen. The addition of a bonus sequel is great; I have yet to play it. ATTN: GAME DEVELOPERS: I have no desire to constantly bore my FB friends and family with posts on my minor game accomplishments. If you have to include these with your game, please also include a way to opt out of all them. I am pleading to you not only as someone who doesn't want your app posting on my FB wall, but also on behalf of every FB user who is tired of getting bombarded with updates on other people's unspectacular app trophies and &quot;accomplishments.&quot;
B00AREIAI8|2.0|Once I get this game open, I LOVE IT! However, I have to shut my Kindle down completely for a little while before I can open the game. It's rather annoying and time consuming and has led my to not play it as much as I want to.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Perfect for my Kindle Fire. It has it all, whether it's for daily use or occasional use, it is perfect.
B008B1VYP0|4.0|The wife is a big fan of Adam L. and of the band, thus when shopping for the cd at Walmart I  also looked on amazon and found it to be much more affordable and loadable to all my devises.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Great read...it was a fun ride to ride along with John and his new friends. If you like Corey's sarcastic humor, you will love this book and his thoughts he has while experiencing a foreign country...again! Some old characters you enjoy, and some old/new ones that may surprise you. DeMille keeps the pace moving and keeps the reader fully entertained as the book unfolds.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I'm on my fourth week of being wheat free.  As the book suggests, I haven't replaced bread with junk gluten free options.  I've lost 10 pounds so far, my sinuses are less congested, and my IBS issues have disappeared!
B007T99ENE|1.0|quite boring...and not interesting. The characters are not at all real and their story quite stupid. I could not even finish it
B0076DCT2G|3.0|Good story idea but really not much suspense and a little too many smart ass remarks thrown in. No comparison to most previous novels.
B007TK77QE|3.0|its OK, but I was expecting more from the Author of Harry Potter: she can do better than that. even the writing style was not as I expected
B00AREIAI8|4.0|So far this game is ok but its a typical in game purchasing game they don't give u much energy because they want you to buy stuff with real money.  It all depends on how patient you are.  Although the best items are one that take forever to collect gems for or require a purchase.
B00B2Q9NM2|5.0|This was very unexpectededly a pleasure to see! Lots of action and excitement and the movie never seemed to drag on.
B005PTQPU0|4.0|Have been a fan of Kate Bush since her first album many years ago. Nice to see that age has not diminished her voice or song writing talent.
B00BB8SKPW|1.0|We only had the movie on for less than two or three minutes the movie is absolute filth do not watch
B005UPOAT2|5.0|Long time fan of movies with Beckensale and Cusack. Even better with both in the same movie in full HD.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This game Is probably one of the best animal rescue games I've ever played. Love it! Keep these games goin! :D
B003O86FMW|5.0|HOLY CRAP THIS WAS AMAZING I LOVED THE ENDING ITS EVEN BETTER THEN THE FIRST  ..... READ THIS BOOK NOW
B007BVT5N4|5.0|I love Justin so just to read this book and his other book was just amazing. He's truly in<br />spiring!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love games that are of visual memory type. This one is compelling. I spend days sometimes figuring out a particular game's paths.
B0054VVRBQ|5.0|cheap and effective. A bit of a pain to get the driver, but works great once oyu have it installed.
B0026IQYEA|5.0|I really like this movie, it is the only one I have on my Kindle. I am always engrossed in period costuming.
0345803507|5.0|I loved this series. I was so hooked i had to leave the books at home. Its like an adult twilight. Loved it wish the books were longer.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I love games that are of visual memory type. This one is compelling. I spend a lot of time playing the game.
B00846F1YW|5.0|Great game, much fun without being too difficult. A good mix of mini games as well!<br />Very enjoyable!<br />Good job!
B0063GORYU|1.0|I don't like this game. There is not enough movement possibility, it is very difficult to play than I am used to for Spider Solitaire.

B000VNMMPM|5.0|This film really got to me.  I found it to be a revealing look into the gift of Grace and why we all need it.  We all get in trouble and can't help ourselves during our lives.  We all need an Angel to come help us.  We all need love and acceptance and often make compromises to find some version of that, but rarely are understood and accepted and loved.  What a wonderful tale even if the theology is suspect.  Besson and his actors are so much fun.  Get it and own it for a replay from time to time.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Doris Kearns Goodwin did a wonderful job blending the experiences and personalities of these men with the happenings of the day.  I consider myself a history buff and probably by more books about history and biographies than any other sort.  She brings these men to life with information about their families, upbringing, education, ambitions, joys, and heartbreaks.  We sometimes fail to remember that famous politicians and leaders are, first and foremost, human beings with the same strengths and faults we all have.  As for the portrayal of Lincoln, the book does a fine job of examining a man who has been written about as much or more than any other historical figure.  I was especially interested to learn about his political skills which I feel have been ignored.  Kearns Goodwin, like David McCullough, has the knack of making history readable.  Not all writers of history can make the same claim.
0316224588|5.0|It is not funny that I cannot put Rankin's books down.  I really enjoy them and look forward to having them to read but when I start I find myself just pushing through them too quickly.  That is not to say that the books don't stick with me because they do.  Rebus is a wonderful character and the cases he works on are almost unimportant.  We are reading crime fiction and we do recognize that Rankin can roll out a mystery in a very satisfying way.  It is just that the author is involved much more deeply with the reader<br /><br />This is a study in loneliness, in aging and in the dark times may people find when they are at the end of a career.  It is also a study in the shift in our society from doing things in a person to person way to a much more technical way.  We are overwhelmed with information and the ability to find data.  What we lack, often, is the wisdom that facts cannot reveal.  I felt the age in Rebus this time.  I felt his self destructive behavior as a way to shorten the time ahead when he will have no meaningful work to do and so much time to do it.  I know that Rankin is writing to a very conservative audience but I do wish that there was a little more information about the passions he feels or misses.<br /><br />It was fun to have Malcom Fox interacting with Rebus and I will be happy to work with Malcom Fox on his next assignment.
B004ZY0VHY|4.0|This book was compelling and creepy, which is what I was looking for. If you like Stephen King or other similar thrillers, this is a good book. My only complaint was the ending. It was a little too storybook, but that's a personal beef.

B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|Ok...I WILL confess....I did NOT want to like this, its the THIRD ONE!!! But they got me again, my husband loved it, I did too and I figure we will watch it several more times.  Josh Brolin did a SPECTACULAR job as a young Tommy Lee Jones, honestly<br />it was weird how good he was, I told my husband I thought Josh played a better Tommy Lee than Tommy Lee did...he was that good.  For this price, you could watch over and over or gift it to someone or a library...if you go to the theatre to see it you will<br />spend more than the price of this for 2 to get in!  A good flick.

B0083P1QUM|3.0|I'm usually a big Cornwell fan but this book left me kind of cold.  It was stale and felt like she just phoned it in.  When the villian was finally unraveled, I had to look back to see who he even was, the character development was so thin.  I'm sick of the bratty way Lucy is being portrayed.  maybe the Scarpetta story has run its course.
B007P6VLR8|5.0|When the Smashing Pumpkins released their 2000 album \\"MACHINA/The Machines Of God\\", it turned out to be their swan song. By the following year, almost all of the members went their separate ways. Lead singer Billy Corgan and drummer Jimmy Chamberlin teamed up for the short lived band Zwan. After that, Corgan released his first and only solo album \\"TheFutureEmbrace\\". James Iha joined the supergroups A Perfect Circle as well as Tinted Windows. Lastly, bassist D'Arcy Wretzky slowly retreated from the spotlight by the time the band pursued different endeavors. Fast forward several years later, Corgan decided to reform the band- but without Wretzky and Iha. The end result was 2007's \\"Zeitgeist\\"- their last album for a major label as well as the last Smashing Pumpkins album with any original members. Five years later, Corgan reformed the band again- this time with a new line-up. He recruited bassist Nicole Fiorentino, guitarist Jeff Schroeder as well as drummer and youngest member Mike Byrne. In the midst of recording their 44 song project \\"Teargarden By Kaleidoscope\\", they released the album within the album \\"Oceania\\".<br /><br />Joining Billy Corgan for the production of \\"Oceania\\" is the recording engineer Bjorn Thorsrud, who worked on every project affiliated with Corgan since The Smashing Pumpkins' 1998 album \\"Adore\\". As always, all of the songs were written and arranged by Bily Corgan. While it's not the original lineup, \\"Oceania\\" sounds very much like a true Smashing Pumpkins record. Starting the album off is the hard rocker \\"Quasar\\". They channel the sound of stoner rock on \\"Panopticon\\" and return to form on \\"The Celestials\\". On \\"Violet Rays\\", Corgan takes a rather optimistic approach to love and takes on an electronic sound with the song about devotion \\"One Diamond One Heart\\". They take on a partially instrumental ballad with the song \\"Pinwheels\\". They evoke the influence of progressive rock that changes in three movements on the nine minute title track \\"Oceania\\". On the noticeably subdued ballad \\"Pale Horse\\", Corgan sings of being left alone. \\"Glissandra\\" is probably the most radio friendly song on \\"Oceania\\", with its almost poppy feel. Being happily in love is the theme of \\"Inkless\\", while they close the album with the song \\"Wildflower\\". The Smashing Pumpkins' \\"Oceania\\" is a great album from the quartet. If anyone has to wonder whether or not the band still holds up despite constant personnel changes, rest assured their sound is still intact.On the noticeably subdued ballad \\"Pale Horse\\", Corgan sings of being left alone. \\"Glissandra\\" is probably the most radio friendly song on \\"Oceania\\", with its almost poppy feel.

B005PK56TA|5.0|I'm not finished with the entire Season 1 yet, but I find the story line engaging, the cinematography extraordinary, and the atmosphere frightening.  The writing, acting and directing are exceptional for a TV series, and this is one of -- if not THE -- creepiest TV series ever.  Warning: not for the squeamish -- blood, violence, sex (some deviant), drugs, profanity.  A real classic horror story.

B007REV4T8|5.0|I gave this a 5 star rating because of both the product and Amazon.<br /><br />This was delivered as advertised and when promised. Amazon did a great job with this!<br /><br />As for the movie, it is not Connery. But it isn't meant to be. And it isn't a re imagining of the Bond character which so many of the films (and later books) are.  we have noticed that except for QoS, the producers have been trying quite successfully in melding the bonds of before with this latest outing. We now know how bond became 007, how he became who he is.  And now we are seeing how the sets of the Bond films can get rolled back to the classic versions. Witness the last scene.<br /><br />And we see how the we can return from Buffoon Bond (Moore) through Dapper Boy Bond (Brosnan) and become Believable Bond (Craig). Unlike all the others, Craig plays the character straight.<br /><br />Sean Connery was the perfect Movie Bond.  His toughness, and his sense of humor (totally missing from any of Fleming s books) and gadgets (done to an embarrassment by the Moore Bond) were staples of the early years.  But none were a part of Fleming's creation.<br /><br />If Connery is the Cinematic Bond, Craig is the Literary Bond. Craig , especially in this outing, plays a human Bond. He bleeds, gets hurt, gets angry, throw a tantrum, and nearly weeps (shades of Vesper!)<br /><br />The charge has been made that the plot was a rip-off of many others - even Mission Impossible.  I concede to that, but the Bond, laddies, the Bond!  This movies wan;t meant to be the stand alone comfortable fare we are used to seeing. It has a depth which takes bond from being a 2 dimensional cut out character, to a 3 dimensional human being. patriot and all. Included we see his attachment to M, the new Miss Moneypenny and how she got to where she is, how Britain finally rids itself of that target on Vauxhall and so on and so on.<br /><br />If you want or expect the usual 007 Kiss Kiss Bang Bang this is not it. But if you want to look deeper into the character and see Bond as FLEMING - not Broccoli - saw him, then you won't be disappointed.look deeper into the character and see Bond as FLEMING - not Broccoli - saw him, then you won't be disappointed.

This is a great show.

B001UGB1X8|5.0|As has been so well commented upon by some other reviewers, this movie is soooooo faithful (and appropriately so) to Burke's novel and his characters, as well as his hero's (?) always so justified outrage and railing at the morally corrupt, who ALWAYS just happen to be wealthy!  Sort of suggests that Burke is setting up straw men in order to express his hostility to authority and the wealth of others, doesn't it?  Nevertheless, I love his so expressive and (if you could call it that given his profane brutality) elegant narrative!  And this is so well carried over into this movie, both the elegance and the profane brutality.  As you can tell, I loved the book, and I loved the movie.<br /><br />As has also been commented here, the movie suffers greatly, as a stand alone piece, through the total absence of introducing the characters (Bootsie, Tripod, etc) to the viewer who is not familiar with his writing - the family members and other important characters simply appear!  I intend recommending this to others, but only (if they are interested) if I have an opportunity to give them an introduction.<br /><br />This is about all I have to say, because of already excellent reviews written by so many others here, except that I believe (and agree with others) that Tommy Lee Jones was so ideally and wonderfully cast in the main role.  Of course, I am bigoted about Jones - I would watch him eating toast, and commenting upon it, even if he did nothing else!

0307596885|5.0|Alice Munro - as if it were necessary - once more proves that she is the past master of short stories. Dear Life is beautifully written, every word in every sentence in every story has its place, nothing is superfluous, nothing is missing. Nothing is written for effect only. Munro does not need big, exciting events to create a story, because she finds material in the smaller things that touch and motivate human beings. It is rumored that Alice Munro is threatening to stop writing short stories - let&#34;s hope it is but an empty threat....

0316077046|4.0|It was difficult to keep from drawing parallels between \\"Beautiful Creatures\\" and \\"Twilight.\\" Two young people are head-over-heels in love with each other, but they come from different worlds. Forces in those worlds, everything from disapproving parents and friends to century-old curses, seem determined to keep them apart. And as if those weren't enough they are doomed to abstinence-only activities, possibly forever, unless one of them is willing to risk killing the other by accident.<br /><br />\\"Beautiful Darkness\\" includes yet another parallel: like Edward Cullen in \\"New Moon,\\" Lena attempts to distance herself from Ethan because she believes that their relationship is holding him back from having a normal, happy life. The difference is that in the case of Lena and Ethan, the calamities she imagines felt all-too-real to me as I was reading. Garcia and Stohl create a much darker atmosphere in the follow-up than in the original. Instead of the defiant optimism of young love that characterized the first book, I was plunged almost immediately into the bleak and ominous aftermath of Macon Ravenwood's death. Even when the optimism does eventually return, it's clearly a decision on the part of the characters, to ignore the problems they will have to face later in favor of celebrating having survived thus far. The dynamic of Lena and Ethan's relationship is drastically altered and new characters are introduced, swiftly turning \\"Beautiful Darkness\\" into a completely different animal than \\"Beautiful Creatures.\\"<br /><br />I enjoyed this book immensely. I found myself stealing moments to read whenever I could, even if I could only get through a page or two at a time on a busy day. I felt like I was on the journey with Ethan, stumbling through unfamiliar territory to find Lena before it was too late.<br /><br />Although I still enjoy Ethan's perspective, one of the things I enjoyed was getting to see more of some of the secondary characters. Link and Ridley, in particular, are two of my favorite characters in the book. Possibly because they are not seen through the rose-colored glasses of young love, or else because they are physically more present throughout the story, they seem more real, more flawed and complete and interesting. Lena, on the other hand, is a constant thought but an almost non-existent presence, and I missed her much more than I missed Edward Cullen in \\"New Moon.\\"<br /><br />The dangers of the Caster world, which existed as a peripheral antagonist compared to the animosity of the citizens of Gatlin throughout most of the first book, comes forward immediately in this installment. I learned more about the Caster world and its (somewhat surprising) connections to the people in Ethan's life, and also found myself with about a thousand questions, in a good way. Despite this shift, the story stays firmly rooted in its Southern setting and characters, and that remains one of my favorite aspects of the series.<br /><br />From one lover of supernatural romance to all the others: so far this series is shaping up to be everything Twilight, with its premise and its stark, arresting cover designs, promised to be and failed to deliver on. Moving forward, I can't imagine that this ending will be anything more toothsome than bittersweet, but at least I know that if the characters ARE all given happy endings, the writers will truly have earned them in the process.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is much like the first version, but, only tougher. I haven’t been able to get as far yet, but I enjoy playing it everyday. I have the same problem with this version, making a turn and run off the course because the touch screen on the Kindle Fire.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Josh makes wonderful music and his Brave is the best. Glad he provided us with another CD so we do not have to wait so long. Hope his tour comes to my city.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is one of those games you just keep trying to do better. The graphics are great. You don’t get a lot of time to look at them though being the game moves right along. It’s frustrating at times when you try to make a turn and run off the course because the touch screen on the Kindle Fire
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I got two versions of this book before I found a translation I felt confortable reading. The translations from French are a feature I did not consider. Make sure you look at a chapter before buying to see if you like the translation.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Perfect for when you have a few minutes waiting.  Easy to read.  Good graphics.  Great for train rides into work when you just want something mindless to do.
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|the movie is promoted as being about a pilot who saved the plane and then fights with the attorneys over fault for the accident.... instead it's a long drawn out story about a totally irresponsible alcoholic and druggie .... totally unrealistic anyone could do the amount of drugs and alcohol he does and be alert at all.  I didn't expect this from a Denzel Washington movie... ugggh.  Skip it.
B006MHWXMS|1.0|This app definitely needs some work.<br /><br />1) Seems to be incompatible with Jelly Bean (4.1.2).  Whenever I try to save a task, the app force closes<br />2) Google integration seems to be half baked. If I want to connect to my google account, it redirects me to a browser to log into my google account. This isn't very clean and a complete pain in the rear if you have multi-factor authentication active. The phone already has me logged in and apps should (and can) authenticate against my google account seamlessly without me having to re-type in my credentials. Lazy implementation.
B0055PMURG|5.0|I watched this movie twice when it came out in the theater.  I had to own it and watch it again because it makes you see that thru the trials in life somethings can be turned into good and having faith and will power to overcome even what seems impossible.  I downloaded it on my Kindle Fire.
B0094K1WZE|5.0|This is the best Mission Impossible yet and great special effects and action scenes.love the the movie.Can't wait to see the next installment
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|Not as good as I expected.  The story was really a disappointment. John Goodmans character was idiotic. Don Cheadle was under-used. Denzel was great but there was nothing about his character that would be attracive to women 20 years younger then him.
B000JQUKKU|4.0|I would read this bood again. There are so many versions that have been written about this book. I love Charles Dickens writings. A Christmas Carol is a book I would read again. It makes you realize that for all the people who have read it, everyone interpertates it differently.
B00846F1YW|3.0|Not bad.  Similar to other hidden object games. A little repetetive. Tap on the dialogue boxes to save some time.
B000002GXX|5.0|Oldy but goody. It's nice to hear the old songs. This was one of the first albums I owned back in the 70's. A little nastalgia in a small disc.
B002UXRGM0|5.0|Absolutely Awesome!!  Way better than the Oprah version!  Amazing things in this world that everyone should see!  Highly educational, but so interesting you'll never realize it's educational.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Michael has a smooth voice and he really showcases this on this album. I like Michael Buble anyway but I think he really does a good job with this CD.
B0053YGYO4|5.0|I saw Coldplay in concert twice for their Mylo Xyloto tour and this album is incredible.  Every song is a hit!
B004GHNIRK|1.0|I feel I am reading a different story. Everythng is about the cardinal. No mention of any of the characters I was expecting to hear about
B00340LM8C|4.0|Still good even after all this time.  Considering that the movie is old, the colors and the photography were amazing.
B0002BO05S|5.0|A gripping tale of Jesus' life. It is a little lenghty but worth watching if you get time on a stormy weekend afternoon.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|I watched this with a friend of mine who was also a Phantom of the Opera Fan and if you saw the show, you will love this even more!
B0090EJR1K|5.0|This is one of the better of the three Sacha Baron Cohen comedy spoofs. Very funny and was able to follow the story line.
B000JQV68A|5.0|THis was a great book. It was very entertaining and has been just what I was looking for.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This novel makes me excited to be a reader.<br /><br />For anyone born in the early 70's this action-packed story is full of nostalgia from our preteen and teenage years.<br /><br />The friendships and romantic relationships are extremely well written.  They come to life on the page.<br /><br />A future doomed world where there is still a hope of undoing man's failures is the backdrop for this story that I found intelligent.
B007JMW46U|5.0|THis was a great book. It was very entertaining and has been just what I was looking for.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
B000HSKUBE|5.0|this is the best of the best...it's completely engrossing and i really want to know what will happen next on the show
B00005JLKB|5.0|You can't not love smallville.  If you are a fan of super heros, then you are going to love this show.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I have tried some other apps, but most are not nearly as good.  I appreciate this app because of its many good choices and its unique ability to combine sounds.  I have tinnitus and it is very effective in soothing ringing ears and headaches.
B001FB4VZS|5.0|What's not to love about smallville?  If you love superheros, this is the show for you!  It is really good.
B009X01GJ2|5.0|I bought this cover for my Kindle Fire HD as a replacement for another cover that I returned. This cover is wonderful! I was a little hesitant about the revolving part, but it actually works very well. I can even read in bed with it. The cover looks like leather, has a nice padded cover and puts my Kindle Fire HD into sleep mode when it closes and wakes it up when it opens.I had no problem getting my Kindle into the cover and it protects it well.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|THis was a great book. It was very entertaining and has been just what I was looking for.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I'm just here to say that this game is a very fun and cool game! thanks and have a nice day
B000JQUZCI|5.0|THis was a great book. It was very entertaining and has been just what I was looking for.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
B00AG6Z92C|3.0|I bought this without first hearing it. That was a mistake. It did not have his usually vibrancy and too much English. I like to hear him in his native tongue. I have two other CD's of his and he sounds stronger in them.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|THis was a great book. It was very entertaining and has been just what I was looking for.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
1611138434|5.0|I thought that this was such a spectacular \\"Listen\\" since I had the audio version. I also do not think the the written story would have been have as interesting as the narrated story. The child who narrates Jack is spectacular!<br /><br />This is such a gut-wrenching story that shows the true tragedies of life and a mother's quest in life to provide the very best outlook for her son in the worst of situations, then turns so tender and leaves you feeling proud of Jack! I didn't seem to have a problem following the story as I do sometimes with audio books. I thought the story was in depth but not so in depth that it drug on forever. I was actually surprised at how quickly the story line progressed.<br /><br />The characters in this book are both lovable and hate-able. Who couldn't love Jack? I actually found myself laughing out loud at many points throughout the story, and loved how the author spoke exactly what was on Jack's mind! Ma did such an excellent job under the dire circumstances she was under and even proved to be human afterall. I did not care for the Grandmother character at all and felt like she had no empathy or patience for \\"Ma\\" or Jack. I also didn't care for \\"Ma's\\" brother or his wife, although the story didn't indulge in them much, thankfully.<br /><br />Overall, I think that this was a very interesting twist to bring out a book of this magnitude from the perspective of a five-year-old little boy, but I think in this scenario, that it was a Grand Slam! I couldn't be more pleased with this read and it will definitely go down as one of my all-time favorite reads!
B004UJAOLM|5.0|THis was a great book. It was very entertaining and has been just what I was looking for.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
B009CF7GRY|5.0|I saw the original when it came out.  I was reluctant to see this one.  It turned out to be very good.  Julianne H.  did a good job.
B000JML7EC|5.0|THis was a great book. It was very entertaining and has been just what I was looking for.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This book should make anyone proud of U.S. soldiers and the performance of the men in battle around the world. Modern media has done its best to paint soldiers our government sends to battle as terrible bullies out picking on polite peace loving people. Its nice to see their heroic actions and the extreme sacrifi es of these patriots deserving the people of America's highest respect told as it really happens rather than some media's effort to spit in their faces while demanding the liberty the soldier insures
B000N6TYLW|5.0|The ending to such a wonderful series!!! I love these girls.  So witty and humorous.  You will grow to love them.
0061537969|5.0|I love this book! It's a great story, especially if you are a big dog lover like me! I definitely recommend it for a casual read.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|THis was a great book. It was very entertaining and has been just what I was looking for.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.

B000JQUMPI|5.0|THis was a great book. It was very entertaining and has been just what I was looking for.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Haven't been able to stop reading.  Got this set less than a month ago and am already on book # 4.  Lots of surprises coming up!
B00000INEX|5.0|You can't have a child and not have baby einstein.  They are so cute and my kids all have loved them!
B0063IH60K|2.0|I don't use this game because I found another solitaire game I like better. It is too slow and didn't like it.
B007EE4XKI|5.0|This book was fabulous! For Data fans it is a MUST READ! It's a quick read and very well written. I Do feel so sorry for  Worf though , can he never have a wife / girlfriend who doesn't die? Maybe someone can resurrect Jadzia?
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Captavating, Fringe pushes the limits of what is real. I enjoyed the 1st season and have started on the second season
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I cannot express how amazing this book was. It brought love, hope, tragedy, and shock. I recommend  this book to anyone looking to lose themselves into a great story!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I just wanted to say that, this is one very addicting game.<br />You'll never stop playing this game because you'll want too keep getting higher levels and better items. I like all games like this and the more I find them the more I get them. Thanks Amazon for another amazing game.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this app so much! Sooooo adicting! I would encourage you to try it. Basically all it is is a ked version of temple run. Give it a try!
