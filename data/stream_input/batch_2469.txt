B004GJ1XU2|5.0|Love this movie. All these actors are my age or a tad older. Very nostalgic. Brings back a lot of memories.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|This game is quite fun, if you can afford to dish out a lot of money for in game gems. The Kindle version has its share of bugs.
B008C20TDG|5.0|I have read it twice and I am still learning!  Highly recommend this book to anyone going paleo  !  buy it
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Well written book.  It has some heartbreaking flashbacks to the orphanage and you are not sure if the book will have a good or bad ending, but it keeps you interested until the last page.
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|APPARENTLY, TOM  CRUISE WAS GOING THROUGH HIS THIRD DIVORCE WHEN HE WAS MAKING THIS MOVIE AND IT SHOWS! HE SEEMED FRACTURED AND JUST WALKED THROUGH THE MOVIE, HE DIDN'T REALLY INTERACT WITH THE OTHER ACTORS AND IT WAS NOTICEABLE! THIS COULD'VE BEEN A MUCH BETTER MOVIE IF TOM WASN'T SOOO PISSED OFF!
B00973902K|5.0|This is a terrific song, and the lines:<br />  Before you came into my life,<br />  I missed you so bad,<br />  And you should know that.<br />transform it from a catchy and enjoyable song into a remarkable song.  The lovely U.S. Olympic swim team video set to the song is frosting on the cake.
B00005RDRO|5.0|My oldest son wanted me to order this and found it hillarous and enjoyed the CD very much.  He is a big Peter Falk fan, plus all of the other stars that appear in this movie.  Had no problems with viewing or hearing the CD.
B005HEQ4XQ|5.0|If you are already a fan then watching this season is a given, but for the uninitiated, I highly recommend the entire series based on the excellent acting, engaging plots and often thought provoking ideas that take you to see how a possible future could be like. Fans and newcomers will find it enjoyable.
B0094K1PW4|4.0|I had no expectations going into this film and was pleasantly surprised to find it a somewhat elegant homage to the entire &#34;child adventure team&#34; genre Spielberg made so much hay with early in his career.  The sets are *exceptional*... Oscar worthy research and attention to detail are poured into the interiors, making 1979 thunder in your eyes.  Costumes, too... feathered hairstyles abound atop ringer tshirts, bellbottoms, and quad roller skates.  Loved it.
B000PY6BBI|5.0|This is still one of my favorite movies. There are few to no special effects, but the story is well worth watching. This is one of the sweetest love stories I have ever seen.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|Its so sad that we don't have a system in this country to take care of us.  ObamaCare is as good start<br />but will most likely go down.<br />Moore points it all out, in glaring facts.
B0083Z614S|5.0|The story was very enjoyable and I wish that there was a followup book.  Actually I wish I could find more books like this.
B0017HEX76|5.0|A classic Disney animation.. Fun to watch alone or with others. Great music and fantastic animation. A must see for all generations
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Angry Birds is always fun to mess around with and this theme makes it so much sweeter. Hope to se more AB themes like The Avengers or something.
B0001I561E|5.0|Great little tale. My young son really enjoyed this. Great characters and some really touching moments, as well as some truly funny times.
1476733953|5.0|As other reviews mention, Howey is a true master of pace and world building.  The world of Wool absorbed me and I had a hard time putting the book down, which in my case is not an easy feat.  The information is delightfully released, never too early but done in such an elegant way I never felt it was held back from the reader to achieve &#34;Sixth Sense&#34; effect.  I highly recommend Howey's Wool and will definitely buy his next book.
B001ILFUDC|5.0|Classic Disney take on a classic story. Unforgettable characters and amazing animation scenes. Who can ever forget Monstro the whale?
B005SHTXN0|4.0|excellent back in it's day and even now after 25 years it's still worth watching at least once a year.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|One ofthe best offerings from Disney. Very touching in parts and very humorous imparts a great family film. Time well spent in watching this
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Continues to be an interesting story with an suspenseful story line. A good show to escape reality and just be entertained.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|To tell the truth I had forgotten about this artist until I ran across it here, I was thrilled to find the CD and the music is wonderful.  Reminds me of my happy youth.
0307744434|4.0|this was a very good read. enjoyed the characters and the images the author sets up in your mind...very vivid
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Beautiful story that is beautifully written! Best first kiss EVER!!!! Now that I know the ending, this will definitely be a re-read for me!!!!
B00005N6RU|1.0|It will not play in my region, so it doesn't do me any good. They  should warn you of that before you buy it.
B004X2M9VY|5.0|How could I not like this show?  One of the best SCI FI / FANTASY shows on TV EVER!  I LOVE it!
B0063M22QO|4.0|Never played the game before. Cost is reasonable. Would like the tiles to be larger.<br />Fun but not easy on the eyes.
B00COHAUD4|3.0|the ending ruined the journey for me; too artificial; the journey (viewing up to the ending) was good! I waited for weeks for the film to become a rental
B000HSKUBE|5.0|Great story line well done and plenty of surprises.  One of the better produced and directed series I have seen.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|This fills the gap that x-files once held in my life.  Only I think Fringe is better.  Great character development, amazing actors/actresses, interesting plot.  All around win.
0061730327|5.0|Purchased the book for my 14 year old. She loved the story. It peaked her interest so much. She researched him on the internet and watched him on TED.
0670014893|4.0|In many ways this book can be difficult to follow, given its lack of linearity, the intermittent \\"Britishisms\\", and the ever-changing timeline.  Furthermore, every page is crammed with detail essential to the plot.  Hence, if you lay this book down for a day-- or even a few hours--it's not easy to re-start. To the contrary, one has to do a lot of backtracking and re-reading to bring things up to the present and to form a coherent whole.  Having said that, the effort is probably worthwhile given the underlying suspense, drama and political machinations.  With respect to the latter, the author does not portray Americans in a favorable light, and this is one of the hallmarks of his career.  As usual, LeCarre's Yanks are venal, mercenary, and heartless, right wingers.  But despite these stereotypes,  the  author's literary prowess is remarkably strong and worthy--in this case--of a 4-Star rating.
B00CM6ZLG8|5.0|I've never really been a Demi fan, but this album just made me one. Before this album the only songs I know by Demi were \\"Skyscraper\\" and \\"Give your Heart A Break\\", which I liked. Every song in this album is just perfect, especially \\"Shouldn't Come Back\\" which is full of emotions and shows Demi's great voice and \\"Neon Lights\\" which is really catchy and could be her next big hit. Demi is a perfect role model for everyone, not just girls, she's a proof that not giving up leads to success and struggles will make you stronger.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I don't think you get to &#34;A Memory of Light&#34; unless you love Wheel of Time! This series has been a huge part of my reading life for over 15 years! Great story, Great ending! I can't believe it's over.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was twisted and still not thrilled with the ending;was hoping for more revenge. It was STILL a great read!!!
B00CH87HF4|5.0|great game awesome graphics and fun gameplay along with a likeable story. I particularly enjoyed the voice acting. definite high quality conversations.
B007WFTFG6|5.0|My grandkids have tons of fun with this game. It was a great download for my family.  Would highly recommend
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Amazing account of the lives, sacrifices and in the author's case, miraculous survival, of some of America's most dedicated defenders.
B00AFWEPVI|5.0|I have used this camera so much. I would highly trained this for your kindle.  Take very good pictures with good quality pictures
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This is not just another navy seal story.  This is a story of one man's journey from obedient loving child to promising high school student athlete to his decent into the deepest depths of drug addiction and his lifetime battle to defeat his inner demons and ultimately become a loving husband and father and warrior hero.  Absolute must read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The kids are having a lot of fun with this so I guess it was worth the download your them
B003ZJ70W4|2.0|Stereotypical movie that reflects so many wrong ideas about the Middle East. I don't know how people believe the things that were stated in the movie!! Even though they filmed some of it in UAE, they did not show the real things that they might have encounter with!! They filmed it to reflect only what  (the writer, the director etc.of the film) wants to believe in!!  overall it was silly!!
B0000640S2|5.0|I LOVED First Blood Part I and when I saw Part II in class, I decided to use it for my paper in the class. I enjoyed the movie and the way Rambo fights for what HE thinks is right.
B0000669JL|5.0|How can you possibly go wrong with a Bob Marley CD...especially a Best of CD. Great deal for a sweet collection of songs
193700788X|1.0|Ok so usually I'm not a book basher. Even when I really dislike a book I can usually give it 2 stars because some author out there has put their heart and soul in their book and wanted it to do good. That being said, there was no heart or soul in this book. I have been devoted to this series from book one and this was the biggest letdown ever. And for me it doesn't even have anything to do with her choice for Sookie's partner. We all know every fan has their pick. Some love Eric, others Sam, and some even Bill (only God know why anyone would choose him) and she obviously couldn't make everyone happy. But this book along with the previous two has lacked everything that drew me to this series. It should have ended several books ago in a high note. It makes me sad to feel this way. Part of me regrets buying the book. And I feel I have wasted several hours of my life when I could have been reading something much more worthwhile. Just sad really......
0385344333|5.0|I would put this novel in the very good category; it has all the typical Lee Child elements that he puts into Reacher books, including mystery, Reacher thinking things through, and the usual bad guy gets nailed in the end.  If you are a Reacher fan, you already have this book as you are addicted to all of the books (now as they come out).  Am I right?
B0067EKYVI|4.0|This story hit too close to home! I can strongly identify with Gatsby. The problem is that when you go to the movies most people, like myself, wants to escape and not be reminded of their failed relationships! I also don't like seeing unapologetic evil win in the end, either! It's too depressing. In the real world there are way too many people like Daisy and her husband!<br /><br />To all the critics who tore this film apart: shame on you! This is an extremely well done movie. You critics don't hesitate shilling for Iron Man, practically comparing it to Shakespeare, but a story with a great screenplay,acting, cinematography and music you trash. Even people who rarely go to movies are telling me how bad The Great Gatsby is because the critics all hate it.<br /><br />All I can say to whomever reads this review: stop being manipulated like you're a sheep! Be your own judge of what is worthy to watch on the big screen! If you're still curious, read the dopey critics after you watch a film!
B001RHPJBU|3.0|Phil Collins was a great singer for Genesis, but for me, many of the songs on this CD are not &#34;hits&#34; I want on my ipod.  I would say about a third of the songs are decent (unless you just like everything Collins sings).  It's a decent deal if you are a Collins fan.
B00C1BTWV4|5.0|Love this movie. Never gets old. From my childhood to adulthood, this movie will always be one of my favorites. Glad amazon had it on here to rent!
1616550414|5.0|The drawings, the history, the manga It's so amazing! Everyone who loves this franchise should buy.<br />I highly recommend it!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I loved this book! A very beautiful ending. These two still have a long ways to go when it comes to mental health but they will be together through it all because they deserve each other and need each other more than life.
B00886XQO0|5.0|Bought it for a little brother and he loves it a must have for gamers its clear and Bluetooth I mean need I as more?
B008AK8FHM|5.0|A good read and inspiring.  it was important to me that the hallucinations during recovery were not omitted.  I appreciated the full disclosure
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The graphics are really great and you don't need internet service to play! However, it slows sometimes, but that is from high quality.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|What can you say about Rod Stewart.  If  you love his singing, you will love this album.  It's a delight.
B005LAIHRC|4.0|Great songs and even better talent than expected by actors/actresses in their singing ability..very well done movie...enjoyed it very much
B00BI73CVI|3.0|Les Miserable is my absolutely favorite musical of all time, and I have seen it off-Broadway in the US and at the Queen's Theater in London. The story is superb, and the music even better. So, I watched this film with much anticipation.  The 2012 Les Mis movie has some very high highlights, and some really low points, which is why I describe it as schizophrenic.  The cinematography was simply superb. The movie really captures the hopelessness of the French poor in the 1800's, and petty jealousy which is unfortunately an ongoing, universal human weakness. The opening scenes were emotionally gripping.  A few key actors really dragged down this film, which could easily be a solid, undisputed 5-stars. The director should have realized he had a few dogs in the cast, and insisted on replacing them; if he attempted to do this, the producer should have listened to him. A summary:  Hugh Jackman as Jean Valjean: Simply superb. The sheer agony of his position as he left prison after 19 years and was attempting to find work was believable and heart wrenching. Watching his face, listening to the passion in his singing - he played this role extremely well. 5 stars for Jackman.  Russell Crowe as Javert: Simply terrible, whether talking about his acting performance or singing.   Anne Hathaway as Fantine: An outstanding performance - her role as a woman who loved her daughter but whose circumstances and the French culture at that time created what could only be a tragic life. Anne was completely convincing, and her singing was quite good - good enough to support the role she was playing and make it believable. Her singing did not match Broadway/London standards, but it was adequate and credible - her performance did not distract the listener during some great songs. A five-star performance.  Amanda Seyfried as Cosette: She played the role well, but she should not have sung - 3 stars.  Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter as the Thénardiers: They failed to capture Thenardiers- who were totally slimy - the portrayals in this movie were cheap thiefs, but they just did not capture the nature of these characters. Their singing just totally ruined &#34;Master of the House.&#34;  They earn 1.5 stars, only because they were not as bad as Crowe.  Eddie Redmayne as Marius: simply terrific performance. Great screen acting, and singing worthy of Broadway/London. 5 stars.  Aaron Tveit as Enjolras: similar to Eddie Redmayne. 5-stars.  Samantha Barks as Éponine: outstanding performance. She captured the tragedy of Eponine's life, both in her acting and singing. 5 stars.
B0044R3X72|3.0|I supposed it was mildly entertaining, but sooo predictable.  It's like the writers said merh, good enough, lets shoot the movie now...
B0034G4P94|4.0|This story will renew your faith in being capable of doing anything you set your mind to.  It will also remind you of how fragile family relationships are.
B00COGY2P2|4.0|This is a much better movie that the typical Tom Cruise fare - which too often seems to be just just action for action's sake.<br /><br />This movie  has a whodunit element that keeps you on your toes and makes it interesting.
B000AP04OM|5.0|Bought this for my parents, for a birthday.  They love the movie when it came out, and they still do.  Great purchase.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Better eleven episodes than none at all, I suppose.  Fox's blatant incompetence and stupidity prevented it from running long and prospering.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|My son started playing this game and loves it, and now I'm hooked on it too.  I gave this 4 stars because it has issues launching &amp; will stop responding. But it's not that often when it does it.
B004LLDN3A|5.0|A wonderful piece of cinema history that probably couldn't be made today because the actors are so classy. It seems most actors now want to sink to the bottom. Or maybe they are just sinking to the level of society. This has something for everyone and I could watch it over and over.
B009VSW15Y|1.0|I paid 1.99 for this app in November 2012 thinking, like the description says, I have to buy a camera app for my kindle fire hd camera to unlock and work. YOU DO NOT!! If you are looking for an app that will allow you to change the color, or take videos ect... then get it. If you just want to use your camera, click on photos, then click the camera icon in the top right corner of your screen. VERY MISLEADING DESCRIPTION!!!
B002HJ9PTO|2.0|This microphone came highly recommended, and I'm sure that when I have time to hunt down the very specific, not-easily-available battery that it runs on, it will be fine. Meanwhile, it is sitting decoratively on my desk, useless, because the battery it came with died within 24 hours, with less than 2 hours of actual use. Win some, lose some.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is a great game for all ages! My kids are the ones who got me to play this game. I am glad that they were able to find a game the enjoy that doesn't have to do with violence.......
B00270WH3Y|5.0|This was a nice addition to my music collection. I've always enjoyed this music and now have it whenever I like.
B00BGIBVP8|2.0|I was expecting a comedy, but most of it is really just dull. The story itself is a bit of a downer too. For a movie that should have been a comedy, I was expecting some funny/happy ending, but the movie just stopped. I wasnt a huge fan
B002ZG98Z0|5.0|enjoyable movie to watch with the fashion and good music.  You do not have to be a sex and the city fan to it enjoy it I purchased this for my mother and she enjoyed it too.
B002361MLA|5.0|it's a book that has stayed in my heart for a long time and in my daily practice. I've also recommended it to many friends.
B00A0NOF7G|4.0|Book seemed too short! Enjoyed the plot. Fairly well written. Fun to read. Will definitely be reading the next book in the series!
B003F3NDP8|5.0|Gift
B00BMEF8UA|2.0|I like Iced Earth as an idea: heavy metal music with great guitar playing, songs that are more than songs but are good tales with a taste for the epic, the progressive as well as power metal hunger,etc. Sounds good right? Well, no because something is missing, namely resonance; there is something \\"flat\\" about this live performance and I don't know what other word to use. The worse part of this album is surprisngly Stu Block. Near the beginning of the performance, some of his high notes are too high that they are laughable. This goes away soon however thankfully. Afterwards, when he does hit those high notes, they are at a perfect register which is what most fans of this type of metal want. Unfortunately, there is not enough of this. Overall, Stu sounds like he's just going through the motions and not giving his best. His vocal register sounds like just a step or two up from talking. The worse part about Stu's performance is the lack of stage presence in between songs. He sounds juvenile referrring to the audience as \\"man,\\" repeating the word Cyprus, and incessantly saying \\"Aigh, Aigh, Aigh\\" or is it \\"Oy, Oy, Oy . . .\\". In between songs, he's just plain boring to listen to. Finally, more bass is needed here. If you are new to this band, start with The Dark Saga, then get Burnt Offerings and Something Wicked . . .
B003Y5HWGI|5.0|book was in great shape bought as a gift for my daughter she loves the series thank you very much
B000JMKRKC|4.0|This book was interesting and enjoyable.  It was not predictable and made you want to continue reading just to know what was happening next.
B009NX522G|5.0|I really love this movie. Its got great actors including Taylor Kitsch. Even if you don't enjoy the movie, I suggest the soundtrack.. its amazing.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I could not put the book now. Glad these men are on our side.<br />Suggest that everyone donate to one of the charities listed in the back of the book.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|I love this dvd series...I'd never watched this before on STARZ channel...but i upgraded my cable package to include STARZ...just so I could watch the second season... I absolutely love SPARTACUS....
B003EI2EH2|5.0|Regardless of whether you follow Tim Ferriss' diet and workout plans to the letter, or you just take advantage of one or two of the tips he suggests, the information that Tim presents in this book will really change the way you think about weight loss, exercise, or physical performance. Tim presents a lot of information and the science gets pretty heavy at times, so it might not be a book for everyone, but if you are a science nerd/data junky like I am, this book will be an interesting read even just as a mental exercise.<br /><br />All in all, a great book. I've been on the Slow-Carb diet from the book for 3 weeks so far and have already lost 13lbs, 3% body fat, and 3 inches off my waist, so it definitely works. But more importantly it sets you up with the information and mental tools to tinker with your own diet and exercise routines to get the results you want with a minimum expenditure of effort.
B000FFJYB6|5.0|This movie touched my heart.  My father has always loved these types of movies so I purchased this for him.  My mother and father both loved it too.  They both shed tears by the end.  Dogs are awesome!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I convinced myself to cough up the extra bucks this year and go for the blu-ray version.<br /><br />It truly does not disappoint, the extra features alone were worth the extra money and the fact it's the combo pack, well, that just means I can watch it anywhere!
B006M7JCC2|4.0|Being of scientific persuasion I have always had difficulty in understanding and accepting NDE’s.  Anita Moorjani has written this book so well without sensationalising her experience that it adds credibility and further inquisitiveness to a subject which I find confronting.  An excellent read and very thought provoking.
034553154X|5.0|I love all the art that has been done for the ASoIaF series, it is all incredible and the artists, talented. This is no exception.
B004X6PRO6|2.0|Sometimes, I wonder!  This is one of the darkest, most depressing books I've ever read. The writing however,was good with the exception of shifts in time that were difficult to follow.  The torture seemed unrelenting. There was a little humor, very little.  Not a book I would recommend.
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|I am just like you guys looking for a good action game. no it takes up half your memory with an Internet download and lags like crazy and its like temple run except better. I suggest looking for a better action game
B004DNWPY4|5.0|Pretty sure the other reviews cover everything you need to know about this book, just wanted to add my 5 stars to the rating. Well worth the expense. I lend this book out on a regular basis. Most people seem to get pretty excited about it. It just makes you reevaluate how you view money, and most people will be better off having read it.
B001AXU1CS|5.0|A classic with a fantastic cover.  Well worth the couple extra dollars to get the leather jacket!  My daughter loves it!
B00005Y7KX|5.0|I've been looking for this for about 2 years after watching it in my French class. I fell in love with the story, voices, and actors. It's a little pricy, but it was totally worth buying!
B002WY65VU|5.0|What can I say.  Zombie apocalypse with Jessie Eisenberg, Emma Stone and Woody Harrelson.  What more could you ask for?  Absolutely hilarious!
B001KZG99A|4.0|Good action. Kept the kids occupied. Should see before 2 and 3 for story on how Iron Man is created.
B003V6L94Q|5.0|Heard Jimmy Buffett sing Knee Deep and love Zac Brown Band music is so easy to listen to !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Jimmy is a god given gift!
B00746TURW|3.0|I was disappointed in the book - had some interesting sections but I felt the name was misleading and the Canadian experiences were so extraordinary to be unbelievable.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Getting older sux! Games such as this help keep the brain cells working. Thanks to Fireproof games for helping me stay young!!!
B002W7J3SO|5.0|The story is one of mistaken identity, with an innocent man chased across the U.S. by agents of an organization who fear he will stop their plans to smuggle out microfilm with government secrets. Cary Grant is mistaken for 'George Kaplan' and kidnapped by workers for spy James Mason. When Grant refuses to cooperate (he can't - knows nothing) they try to kill him and make it look like a drunken driving accident.<br /><br />An actual and an attempted murder later, Grant ends up in Rapid City, South Dakota with Mason and government agent Eva Marie Saint, with whom he's fallen in love with. The movie ends with a chase scene on Mt. Rushmore, followed by the shot of a train speeding into a tunnel.<br /><br />Well done by Hitchcock et al.
B000I8JEY2|3.0|Not what it could have been. Two top actors and the script was a bit lame.Still worth the time to watch.
B004GYY714|5.0|Great app. I can listen to all my local stations with this app, unlike other radio apps I've tried that don't have my favorite stations available. Works on Kindle Fire HD. (I live in the Seattle area and have tried Pandora, IHeartRadio, LastFM)
B000031EGV|4.0|It is one of those movies that are perfect for some family time spent with your kids or the younglings in your family. It combines the fun of a board game night and that of a movie night into a 100-minute fun ride.<br /><br />The director's execution of the film is very engaging, rendering it breathtaking to watch. The DVD also comes with tons of bonus features and valuable documentation footage about the movie. I'm thinking of maybe purchasing the bluray copy too in the future.
B00AB7HESI|3.0|It's alright not much to say about it. Sometimes it is really hard to tell what the game needs you to do next.
B003TTMFCK|4.0|Well, we've watched it through 6 seasons and we're still hooked.  I enjoy not having to wait a week between episodes.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is a lot of fun. The graphics are good and large enough to really see the action. I like that you get coins in the game to use in the game. I have not had to buy any.
B00280LYIC|3.0|A quick easy book to read.  Entertaining enough for adults, written for the younger generation.  A nice blend of the past and the present.  I will continue to read the series.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|outstanding, very entertaining, looking forward to the next one. The animation is unreal. the story line is action packed and is good clean fun.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|If you haven't seen this show....you need to see it...it reels you in and gets you hooked! I can't wait for Season 2 on DVD!!!
B0054R6BFM|4.0|This book was amazing, very emotional. I like the significance of the ending. This was a very creative idea, and pretty realistic. Good book!!
B009GEFXLC|5.0|This is the best season by far. I am going to hate waiting all summer for the new season!Excellent Writing.
193700788X|5.0|I saw this ending from the very beginning. Thank you Mrs. Harris for the wonderful ride. Now I can read your older books.
B008220DIC|5.0|What many found disappointing in \\"The Master\\" - Anderson's firm rejection of dramatic storytelling in favor of unblinking, measured study (of character, of period, of state of mind) - I found totally riveting and endlessly entertaining. The film feels, to me, like a successful conclusion of the experiment the director began with \\"There Will Be Blood,\\" by which he proves that meticulous observation of life can be as compelling as a parade of exciting plot points. Freddy and Lancaster are such fascinating men, and so realistically depicted, that if you're like me, you'll spend the movie's duration watching carefully for clues as to how they affect the ether around them, or how that ether effects them. Life is strange and beautiful, and \\"The Master,\\" so well-observed a depiction of life, is also strange and beautiful. As a viewer, I was engaged and excited; I was never bored. One of the best films I've seen in years.
B00BS4PF0C|5.0|That's all.  But this is a very good album, probably one of his best to date.  So much so that my non-country listening husband has hijacked my CD.  A nice mix of upbeat, fun songs and heartfelt ballads, there's something for everyone here.
B009MYAQK4|5.0|This book was just as amazing and inspirational as every book I have ever read of Paulo Coelho's. I always managed to read the right passages at the time that I needed to read them the most. HIGHLY recommend this book!
B00BB22GQM|5.0|The album title is the hook that caused me to buy this CD.  I thought this music would be dark and scary, but I found that the majority of the songs on this album to be completely opposite of that.  Erza Koeing has such a soothing voice.  He makes this album worth listening to.  The other three band members really compliment Erza's vocals with their instruments. The best songs on this album are the songs that involve some sort of personal struggle.  My favorite song is \\"Ya Hey\\".  This song is about trying to find a place to call home and not finding it.  My other favorite song is \\"Everlasting Arms\\".  This song is about struggling to find love in someone who not there.  This song has rather bleak lyrics, but it has a beautiful tone. \\"Unbelievers\\" is a song about pondering about what happens to people who die who do not believe in God.  This is a thought provoking song.  \\"Finger Back\\" is a song with graphic violent lyrics.  This song has such a pleasant tone that I did not even pay attention to the lyrics.  \\"Worship You\\" is a song about looking for direction and guidance. Chris Tomson provides a superb beat on the drums with this song.  \\"Diane Young\\" is a song that simply infuses me with energy.  I love this tune.  I am still trying to deceipher the lyrics of this song. \\"Step\\" is a pretty love song.  I love the piano playing by Chris Baio here.  \\"Hannah Hunt\\" is a song about the intimacy between a man and a woman in a relationship.  \\"Hannah Hunt\\" is  another beautiful track with melodic piano playing. \\"Modern Vampires of the City\\" is an entertaining album by Vampire Weekend.

B00499QUK2|5.0|More like films. They put some real work into their plotlines. I will keep watching as long as they keep putting this kind of effort into the story lines.
1590171993|5.0|I was shocked at how poignant this was. Like, actually shocked. It's about the life of an obscure, Midwestern college professor from the prewar era. He goes to school, falls in love with literature, marries an almost unbelievably cold, spiteful woman, has a kid, deals with petty, nasty university politics (I've never wanted to be an academic less than I did after finishing this), has an affair, gets older, the basic stuff of an academic life, or really almost any life. Williams's prose has a directness and earnestness that even the most jaded of readers could appreciate. He shows the successes and more often the failures of William Stoner's life with stoicism and honesty, and that's all the more impressive because he does it in such a plainspoken style that puts the characters at the forefront in an extremely direct way. I found it hard to put down, not because it's a thrilling page turner, but because it feels so incredibly real. Like putting together the life of someone you see in an old black and white portrait no one remembers or cares about anymore. I highly recommend this, simply because I can't imagine anyone reading it and not being at least a little moved by its thoughtful, if often despairing view of a a single human life
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Fabulous!  Every season is a winner.  Wonderful ensemble,  Never a disappointment  Have watched every season at least twice and will no doubt do the same with season 10
B004H1V5RU|5.0|This is the most challenging, frustrating, adrenaline pumping ball of fun ever.  We leave it out and when company comes over, everyone tries to master it.  I have reached level 43, out of 100. IT is so hard, but addicting! Would be great for a plane ride, or road trip! All ages can try it!
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I love twitter, it allows me to stay in touch with the world on a broad level that would otherwise be lost to me
B0084B5TK8|4.0|A classic horror story well worth reading to see the origin of timeless characters portrayed in film and elsewhere over and over again. Read the original for a 'taste' of horror...
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I saw the first &#34;Hunger Games&#34; movie and was spurred to read the trilogy.  As with most titles, the books were way better than the movie.  Very well written.  Excellent character development.  Intense, suspenseful plot.  Kept me on the edge of my seat much of the time.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great book.  Fast read!  Kept you guessing and involved.  Couldn't put it down. Loved it!  It is my 'book of the year'!
B007SGM084|4.0|A couple of co-workers suggested I would like this trilogy.  I thought it was a typical romance and had no idea what I was getting into.  Wow!  After my initial shock, I have to admit I couldn't put my Kindle down.  Maybe it's not Shakespeare or Austen, but still good entertainment and several unexpected twists.  I've now read the entire trilogy three times!  Recommended for adults only due to very explicit BDSM content.
B0018QXL1K|5.0|Best TLC project in my eye. It seems as if every si ng was a hit. DIGGIN IN YOU, CREEP, REDLIGHT SPECIAL, WATERFALLS, and etc
B00CHSPB8Y|2.0|Fun game. I enjoyed it a for a little while. Then it froze requiring a hard shut down of my Kindle. After the third time it froze, I gave up. It's not worth the space on my Kindle if I keep having to do a hard shut down (never good for an electronic device).
B001DM1VXE|1.0|Couldn't get into it more than 10 minutes.  Awful. Don't waste your time.  I'm a math geek and thought it would be interesting.
0810989956|5.0|my kid is enjoying writing in her special diary.  I haven't had a time to look inside but she says it is better than the one her friend lent her.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Especially our snipers !<br />This book was a great testament to the work done by our men down range... Damn few!
1419705849|2.0|I liked the other diary of a wimpy kids book so I thought why not.  I did not enjoy this one as much.
B00CL68NOG|5.0|I really loved this movie becasue it show how our children think they don't need our advice or will not take their parents advice, just becasue its coming from them.<br /><br />Children believe they do not need their parents again, when in actual sense they do.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Great chip. Overclocked without any problems to 4.4 Ghz with aftermarket air cooler.<br /><br />If you are looking for something in this range and are interested in overclocking this is the only choice. Comes with a sweet Core i5 sticker for my case. I just wish the sticker had the K on it showing I got the unlocked chip. I'll be okay though,
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|Always enjoyed the early years of Walsh. This goes back to some of his early solo album sound. Which makes sense that he would call it Analog Man. Reaching for the old rock and roll sound and adding Jeff Lynne to help him out in the background. It offers a video/DVD of the best songs and a little interview of Joe in between them for entertainment. Buy and enjoy this one, for he may not be around much longer to make more.
B0067R0APK|3.0|I upgraded to the platinum version based on the free app that I had been using for about a year.The older app  was easier to use and much better to look at, especially the extended forecasts which were very colorful! I am not sure I would have upgraded if I knew that the format was going to be so different. Having said that, the app provides a lot of helpfull info.
B00BESM14U|5.0|The story touched my heart. I loved everything about it, the acting, directing, and story line. I highly recommend it.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I have a great time playing this fun game. good for when you get bored! start playing now! so much fun!!!!!
B002BWP49C|5.0|The only bad thing about was how it ended because at the time the 2nd part was still not out but overall I like it.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|✔ Awesome and simple controls<br />✔ Loved by kids, when my daughter has her playdates kids have a blast with this app on a larger tablet 9.7\\" Touchpad<br />✔ Small  memory footprint, no crashes. Tried on Note 2, Asus Fonepad as well as the HP Touchpad..
B002M5E2DW|4.0|Really changed the way i think. I recommend to anyone struggling to find happiness.<br />She's really repetitive, but that just helps imprint the perfect message.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|I really like this show, but I am having frequent buffering issues with Amazon Prime Video and movies I've rented from Amazon. I upgraded my internet to faster speeds and still have buffering issues. Why can't Amazon provide a better experience like Netflix and Hulu Plus have done?
B007ZXK08C|4.0|this book was a good read and kept me guessing, enjoyed it to the end. would definitely recommend it to friends and family
B0058YPGL6|5.0|My son really enjoys this show, so I bought it for him when the price was right. He loves the spooky type of shows.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|The main reason I got this is so I could have a list of my personal videos, not just the icons the Kindle presents. The only real problem is that the video player looses it's mind when I advance the slide too quickly into the movie. But this was easily remedied by selecting the native Kindle player as the default player.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Nelson DeMille does it again with another good John Corey novel.  Interesting to read and I always learn a lot.  John Corey is fun to read about but I think he would get pretty tiring in real life.
B0094M2ITG|4.0|Interesting movie. Not the same old script. This is a movie that can be enjoyed by the whole family. The end.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I didn't like the language and felt the story was disjointed. There are so many other better things to read.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|I can't say enough about this book.  I really, really enjoyed it!  A great book on amnesia with alot of suspense.  I did not see this particular ending coming!  Loved it!
B002K0WBXW|4.0|I received what I thought I was going to receive. Therefore I am satisfied, and would recommend this to my friends.
006114665X|4.0|This is an excellent book, highly detailed and very informative. The one thing I sorely miss is a bibliography. I know reams of paper have been written about the causes of WWI, but really, even a selected bibliography would be helpful if you want to do more research.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|I am not a fan of Civil War movies but the portrayal of Abraham Lincoln and his excellent political skill to achieve his goal was very well presented and the acting was excellent.  Sally Fields also did an excellent job in her role as Mary Todd.  You have to admire all the people that achieved such an excellent view of events and circumstances of that time.
B000VWYJ86|4.0|Bragging that you took scenes from the other Bourne movies and just redid them for this installment doesn't seem like the brightest confession director Paul Greengrass could have made.  Copying oneself is not a homage, it's a lack of ideas, forcing you to repeat yourself.  Calling these repeats \\"deliberate allusions\\" doesn't mask the fact that they are the same scenes lifted from the other films and just reshot/repurposed here.  In some cases, considering the order in which they were replayed, they completely cancelled out the history of the first two films.  I didn't pay all this money just to watch the same thing all over again.  The only new additions were more bad guys that weren't addressed in the other films.  Suddenly, we have Scott Glenn as Ezra Kramer the EVIL director of the CIA (looking, I might add, every bit of 584.  Practically mummified, isn't retirement offered after the first 100 years of age?).  Late in the game, another old geezer pops up as the EVIL Dr. Albert Hirsch (Albert Finney).  He's the psychologist in charge of Treadstone's behavioral modification program.  And taking over the clich&eacute; role of dogged pursuer from Joan Allen, who took over the same role from Chris Cooper, we now have prissy David Strathairn as Noah Vosen, the CIA deputy director in charge of Operation Blackbriar..........giving the exact same KILL BOURNE orders.  Nothing says tedium like repetition.  At this point, the byzantine plot is wearing thin due to overuse: same conspiracy, same chases on foot and in vehicles, explosions, death and destruction, same hyper editing, everything is secret-top-secret-secret...........  Who is Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles) and why won't they allow her to do more than just pop in and confuse things?  And why, for pity sake, didn't Jason Bourne ever use disguises!?!?!?!?<br /><br />My response is the same, it's Matt Damon's charisma that kept this thing afloat.  Will he return for Bourne 5?
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|I chose the rating because it was a good action movie.  After getting used to the fact that this was not the Jack Reacher I had read Lee Child's 17 books about, I was pleasantly surprised.  It's a big difference from 6'5\\" x 250#  and Tom Cruise.  I was disappointed when Tom was cast for the lead.  But during the TV hype about the movie, I decided to see it as soon as it was available on Amazon. I actually wasn't expecting to like it.<br />I was pleased to see that they didn't shoot 'up' at him or give him a lot of boxes to stand on to make him look like Reacher.  They just let him be tough like Reacher.  I'm not a great Cruise fan but I actually liked him in this movie.  He's improved with age or maybe Reacher was a good vessel for him.  There were a couple of tremendous car chases.....does anybody learn that Reacher hates to drive, is a terrible driver and doesn't even have a driver's licence? New side of him, I guess.<br />I would and have recommended it.  Just don't read the books first.  I think I would have given it five stars if I hadn't.
B0000AC8LL|5.0|I first saw this movie many, many years ago and loved it! When I found it on Amazon, it was no contest....had to buy it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Awesome she did a great job on this book<br /> I seen the movie it was epic. I love the hunger games<br /><br />- stay calm and let the games began
B002OHDRF2|5.0|We've enjoyed the other Terminator movies, but I think this is the best one of all. It has a lot of good actors and a lot of action.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|your a shark and you get to swim around and eat things.  I love this game. I'm not sure what elsento say other than its great for a free app. not 20 words yet... get the app. need a few more words... best free app ever.
B001AEF6BI|5.0|A classic! This is one of my husband's and granddaughter's favorite movies. They watch it over and over again. lol
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Can't believe I didn't watch this on TV from the beginning! So glad I can catch up here!  Can't wait for next season!
B001GCUO1Q|5.0|My husband and I had gone to see this at the theater, but about half way through the movie, the power went out. We've enjoyed the other X-men movies.....this one included.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Loved the movie in the theatre and again watching via Amazon Prime. No gimmicks or gadgets and yet, still thrilling. Love placement of Adele's song and the mood of London and Scotland, love Judy Dench, Mr. Bardem plays the evil guy perfectly, and Daniel Craig is the best Bond of all.
B00003CX95|5.0|I had this on VHS, so when I found it on Amazon at a very good price, I bought it. Great movie!
B002O3Z50G|5.0|Fast shipment for this item.  Very reasonable price and it helps to complete my collection.  So happy to have it.
B00008G8LN|5.0|My granddaughter loves this movie. Not only does it have Patrick Swayze in it but also Keaneu Reevse....two of her favorite actors.
B008GJV4F2|4.0|Sometimes  a girl needs a little lemonade, or chocolate, in her life. Binoche is always a delight, as is the entire cast in this light and charming fable. After a heavy week, it was just what I needed to relax.
B000ZOXDFA|5.0|My daughter and I love the first movie. We are both into &#34;the Tudor&#34; era. Although, these movies are more entertaining then factual, the are still good.
B007BVOEPI|2.0|Though I'd be happy watching Sean Bean painting a wall, I found this series trite--and as with most fantasy, it references the medieval period. Why is that, I wonder? The most interesting part (for me) were the Scytho-Sarmation type horse people. Now that's something new and interesting. I only watched the first episode, so perhaps the series got better as it went along.
B000W91RUG|5.0|I love it and would tell everyone to get it this show is so funny to watch over and over again
B0054SMID0|5.0|Great movie with great actors. Good story line. Great drama with some action. Matthew is always a good actor but he plays a tough guy here not a romantic character so it's a nice change for him.
B0011UJMK2|4.0|lots of twists and turns.  It gets a little sweet at the end, but it was a good read and I recommend it.
B0054SMID0|4.0|great movie a bit too much buffering. The right amount of suspense and action.  Love Matt, the characters really brought out my emotions.
0316227706|5.0|if you like/love dogs and, if you've ever had a dog who loved the water, you will not be able to keep from laughing as you go through this book.  kudos to seth and his patience and talent in working with dogs.<br />and thank you, seth, for bringing back memories of our late, water-loving lab.<br />he was our first &#34;child&#34; and he had his own plastic, water-filled pool of heaven on the patio.
1936608898|4.0|Great book offering essential information on improving your health through food! Highly recommend to anyone wanting to experience significant health boosts through their diet.
B0098460O4|5.0|I stumbled across the Britain's Got Talent initial appearance of Jonathan Antoine and Charlotte Jaconelli and watched without any presumptions.  I had one of the biggest surprises of my life!  Noting that they were greeted onstage by some indifference, if not disrespect, I listened to the bit of background info Jonathan offered, and then came their performance.  Well, history was made (and recorded) before the entire world.  To know they were just 17 and 16 years old at the time is mind-boggling!  I called friends who also called friends ....and most of us, in tears, felt the same astonishment.  A privilege just to witness these two artists together.  Their story just gets better.<br /><br />They were IMMEDIATELY signed to a recording contract by one of the judges (who spoke rather critically to them at first.)  Their album (CD) is SO worth owning, though they certainly do not need a background chorus at all.  It's a year later, and I often check for any more news about them.  They have become beloved of many, many people --for more than one reason.  I wish each of them every happiness....and pray for them to have the best kind of guidance.<br /><br />I still re-watch their first appearances, listen to their CD, and enjoy very much the 46-minute documentary about them on you-tube.  We are all eagerly anticipating their next steps, yet certainly want to respect their privacy.<br /><br />They are both sweethearts, and so sincere.  Please, protect what you are!
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|Fabulous book.....tells the reader SO much about India.  And so realistic. You can feel that you're actually there.<br />Great story too.......
B006M4F67A|5.0|Beautiful graphics, several choices of layouts, relaxing background music. Runs fast without slowing down kindle and no noticeable ads. Very enjoyable.
0812992784|3.0|I am a big fan of Rushdie. He is an exceptional story teller and his magic with words has to be experienced to truly understand it. Of course then a bio of him was on my list of things to read. Unfortunately Joseph Anton is very monotonous. It drags on a lot and there is a lot of the story which could have been avoided if the author did not indulge in, what at times looked like, name dropping.<br /><br />On the whole an OK biography but will not blow your mind like his other works.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|It has been ages since I read any science fiction and this was great.  I particularly loved the problem solving and science that was involved and the characters seemed real.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|I love Kathy's writing. The books are all easy reads and she ends each chapter in such a way that you have to keep reading. I often read the entire book in one day this one was no exception. Highly recommend but best read in order of publication.
B00AKKTDJY|1.0|This was the free app of the day today, so I thought I'd try it. I have a Motorola Xoom, which is a decent device. It simply will not play this. Keeps crashing. I ended up uninstalling it before I even got a chance to play the game.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Very nice my kids loved mixing up all the sounds to make own melody. Its calming and peaceful app for all ages.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|Interesting story. Fast forward plot. Real present world issues, no doubt many middle age parents like my myself found chilling similarities with our teens and Jacob but the truth was never known.  Was Jacob a murderer by nature? Or did his own father killed for him? Or maybe his Mom ?<br />I have already recommended DJ to many friends, good read.  Wilfred Echevarria
B00COHIFQS|3.0|this movie is average. Concept is nice and some scenes are nicely done but that's about it. watch it if you got nothing else
B0045XGRQE|4.0|The movie was packed with action and great storyline. It would have been better to develop the characters a bit more.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|I loved this movie when I first viewed it in the theater and I love it every time I watch it.  Now I can watch it whenever I choose!
B001974DG0|5.0|This was one of the best books I have ever read. Everyone should read this book although it's not for young kids.
1574216988|5.0|Good for the beginner.  The advanced tangler can &#34;draw&#34; some inspiration from the workouts in this book and move on to the next level.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I loved this book!  It kept me entertained and always waiting for another disaster to happen with Travis and Abby!
B00C2VIA52|5.0|this game if un and makes u think a bit i reminds me of duel monster and i enjoy playing it a lot win or lose
B005CRQ4XI|3.0|Much of this book is interesting, but there seems to be a back story that has been left out - maybe there is another book in the works. Sometimes there was too much angst and not enough description of the trail. And  if you lost your place, when you picked up the book it was hard to tell what might have been missed - it could have been anywhere along the journey and it was still the same sore feet and bad memories..
B004H1V5RU|5.0|However it's pretty tough. I bought this one first and perhaps should have bought the original first. They give it 20-30 minutes and then give up.<br /><br />Good conversation piece though :)
B005XTLAQQ|5.0|I loved how it is so close to Bella, and the fact that it has everything she was wearing on her wedding day. I have three of these dolls, and I as, a gift for my daughter she loves it, and all the movies, where still collecting everything. love it love it....
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|this is best 1 player game because this is just like grand theft auto and I loved that game this game took its place
B004DLPXAO|2.0|It won't load completely. I am very computer illiterate but even I know when something doesn't work right. It stalls( the little moving circle hesitates) then the screen turns black and then the app closes out. I'm not happy
B008602KQI|4.0|Gruesome concept but more enjoyable than I expected.  Would never watch with my children though.  What kind of minds think up these things.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game might seem like a copy of temple run but it is more easy to control. I hate the lag which happens from time to time.Overall it is epic
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Loved the movie  the game has great graphics in the same style as t he movie. So far I am having fun.
0307895475|5.0|I am very glad i ordered this guide, now i see where i was having issues in some parts and is a  very indepth book..includes Hearthfire and Dawnstar stuff too...I had hoped it would include the latest add on to Skyrim ...but...this ain't a perfect world!!...good stuff in this book!!
B0067TQQI8|5.0|The real test comes this summer when I will be camping for a week (I will update my review if needed then), but for right now it's working great. My Samsung Galaxy S will run out of battery life in a day! I have already used it over a weekend campout and it kept my phone working - just like it should.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I was raised with people who had lived in the camps and (honestly) I have carried negative feelings about Germany my whole life.  This beautifully written book looks at the lives of two men - one German and one American.  I saw the war through their eyes and understood (for the first time) what the people in Germany went through during the time of Hitler.  I already knew what the Jews and the Americans went through, but I didn't realize that many of the German people did not like or want Hitler.  I was really glad I had read this book because I see the German people in a new light.<br />  Beside all of that - this true story is wonderfully written, exciting, and held my interest from beginning to end.
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|Perfect reboot of one of my favorite shows. JJ Abrams got all the characters and there relationships right. I loved every bit of this film.
B00AFROVQC|1.0|I was excited to read this series, based on previous reviews and on Amazon's recommending it to me.  However, I found nothing redeeming about it.  The writing was awkward (does the author even know what a sneer is?  She consistently used the word in appropriately.).  The characters were inconsistent (Is the queen a positive character?  A negative one?), and behaved inexplicably (so why is the queen against the main character?  we never find out.).  Plot elements were borrowed freely from other series (e.g., Band of Brothers); the weirdest borrowing was the use of obscure stories from the Old Testament.  Some scenes were age-inappropriate (seriously, do you have to describe the rape in that kind of detail to an audience who are developmentally at a stage where their sexuality is developing and being shaped by their experiences?).  I wanted to finish the series, just to get some closure on the plot.  But halfway through the third book, I got so fed up that I did something I almost never do:  I just put down the book and walked away.
034580404X|5.0|This is so good if you need some sex then you need to read this and have fun with your man
0761169253|5.0|I've given away exactly 54 copies of this book and everyone says 'Thank You,' of course, upon receiving it. But here's the good part: every one of those people - every single one - has contacted me AFTER finishing the book to say THANK YOU much more emphatically.  The style of writing, combined with the layout, seduce you into beginning to read. You won't fully realize you've begun reading the book until several minutes later. Buy it. You won't regert it. Better yet, buy three. You're going to need a couple extra to give to people you love.
B00COHAUD4|1.0|Not a very good movie. A spirit that raises children, seriously! The ending was particularly bad in which the spirit becomes jealous and tries to keep the children. One of the worst movies I have seen, thumbs down
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Loved the main character, felt for her in so many ways. Was also fascinated by the way she coped with the life she had. Well written.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I would like to say that this writer has an amazing way of pulling you into the story. It starts fantastic and ends fantastic but about 60 to 75% of the way through you are waiting and waiting and waiting. I would've just liked to have seen more action and less court case. But maybe that's the way he wanted it! My personal opinion.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|One of those books where the story carries it. Well drawn characters, tragically beautiful story. I would highly recommend it.
B00CDT41RY|3.0|It was an okay movie.  It just sort of fell apart at the end.  Lots of blood and guts. King the dentist was the only character with any depth.  When he died, it just fell apart.  The music was fun and I enjoyed it and the scenery was good.
B009YP9L7U|2.0|This book was hard for me to get into. It was very predictable book. Not really impressed.  I would not waste time downloading even though it was free.
B0028KF4M4|5.0|My favorite series of all time, I have to say, Dexter's like medicine for me.  Amazon says I have to keep writing because that's not enough words, perhaps next time I won't bother rating anything.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I got this for my grandson to play on my kindle. He has so much fun and so do I . We love this game.
B000ARFNNM|1.0|This should have been highlighted before I purchased it.  Obviously it wash&#34;t when I purchased it.<br />I can play it on my computer but it changes the region on my computer and then I can not play my regular DVDs and then you are told that you can only change the region on the computer 4 more times and then you're stuck with what ever you last change it to.
B0013TTLDE|5.0|This is a wonderful novel about an tragic, aristocratic English family, told in flashbacks by a devoted servant near the end of her life. The writing, the characters, the plot --- all magnificent.
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|I loved the story, describes a strange family where a girl is constantly disregarded and persuaded.<br />She does not recognise this until she loses her great love because of all the prejudice and the persuasion...<br />But now she has a chance to win him back...<br />Wonderful.
B009R659L8|5.0|This book was fantastic.  I couldn't put it down. I love Mary Higgins Clark and this book was true to her gift for suspense.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|Awesome series of books, definitely a pick me up when you've finished with Mr Grey, you won't be able to put it down
B00COHAUD4|3.0|The ending was not what I expected.  The little girl should not have been killed in the end.  They should have ended it with the &#34;mother&#34; just disappearing.
B008KMHFJY|3.0|Can't really see what all the hype is about this book, quite disappointing. Certainly not a book I couldn't put down.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I orininally missed some of the first season, so glad I went back and was able to watch all of them!!! So good!
B00A7YZ1KI|1.0|After all the great books and this is what it comes down to....disappointing and so hard to get into. What a shame!
B005C0DHEY|4.0|Will natural gas be the next big thing? This question wasn't answered, but the pitfalls of the industry were enumerated in quite a bit of detail. I liked the documentary's exploration of problems with allowing a process as destructive as hydrolic fracturing to spoil some of the most pristine areas of our country. However, like most American documentaries, it does not present a balanced picture, but is completely one-sided. It does a good  job of showing the human side of what is bad about the industry, and the host is engaging and credible. I just wish it didn't feel so much like a witch hunt.
B009NQKPUW|1.0|Really?  What a waste of $5, too bad Riddley Scott wasn't aware of how bad this movie was; where was the continuity.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Fun times! The characters tell a story throughout the levels. Good game to pass the time! Only wish there were more mini games to play.
B00992CF6W|4.0|The app is pretty good...the only thing I can say is the update are a little far behind so don't go looking for some thing like pc/xbox... besides that a nice way to bring mincraft mobile....
B00005NNT1|5.0|Great DVD and story, who would not love a Disney movie! My daughter is almost 3 and loves the Disney princesses and she loves Snow White.
B004SRPXWQ|1.0|Tom won't talk on the kindle fire.It  is crap :(. What the  hell is this.It's a rip off . Screw this.
B00024I2Z4|5.0|Great DVD and story, who would not love a Disney movie! My daughter is almost 3 and loves the Disney princesses and she loves Mulan.
1401235425|5.0|Had a few cocktails and text my friends about this awesome story line. Can't wait to read more. Good ol Bats
1401233376|4.0|I don typically read Flash but this was a solid read. Great way to space New 52 issues. DC  knows what their doing.
0451219597|5.0|Ken Follet seems to know exactly how to write a plot, develop it, and insert characters that are true-to-life.<br /><br />I had picked this book out as a seemingly interesting read for a school project. I had no idea that I would be immersed in the world of German-occupied France.<br />The characters are truly life-like in is novel. Flick is such a cunning, intelligent woman. The amount of deception in this novel is quite a bit, but it pulled off in such an incredible way. It was even more immersive due to the fact that we are given the viewpoint of multiple people throughout the story. I found myself in awe when I realized the true intentions of some of the characters. Even I was deceived by them.<br />Truly incredible.<br /><br />I'm definitely going to pick up another novel by Ken Follett.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I loved Bloons 4 so when I saw there was a new one I had to get it. The update with the engineer monkeys helped me get past a lot of the higher levels.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This is certainly a fun game. I'm addicted to this game. I saw it had at least a 4 star rating so I gave it a go. It's like Temple Run but with Tony Stark. Great game and it's free so what's not to like.
0385349947|5.0|An inspiring book that is written in a manner that holds your interest. I think every manager, male and female, should read it.
B003V6L94Q|4.0|Easy to listen to and sing along with.  Variety is good and the quailty of music you'd expect from ZBB.  Arrived well packaged and undamaged.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|I think this app is good for me because if I am angry I can just smack tom or step on his foot
020530902X|5.0|It is a classic I gave to my granddaughter. She is in college and needs it for her English class.
B00BF11STU|3.0|The film is overall good, but does mislead the viewer, It lacks constant action. I dont think I would rewatch it or even recommend it.
B009AMANBA|4.0|It is a good movie. Best portrayal of Abe Lincoln so far. If you like Civil War History, then this is worth having in your movie collection.
B005S9EK5Y|4.0|It is a good movie, but it does not have the singing power of the stage production. Worth to keep in your collection.
0670026557|5.0|Wow, this guy has some very revolutionary insights.  You can do well by doing good, if you are careful not to be a &#34;door mat&#34;.  I like the sophistication in the writing and the data that backs it up.  I am going to ask a number of my friends who run non-profits to read this and think about how they can employ the tools he provides to better represent their interests.
B007ZXK08C|1.0|I was really looking forward to a good thriller, after it getting massive reviews in the papers as well!! I don t know what ye are reading but this particular read was dreadful! Very badly written! Almost amateur!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|There were a couple points I thought were kind of slow but it was better than I had expected. Definitely a great end to a great series.
B000V1Z8KK|4.0|I decided to watch this film after another one of Antoine Fuqua's movies (\\"Olympus Has Fallen\\"). And it shares a VERY clear thought: politics will mess you up if you get too involved. I really believe he's found his niche and am so impressed with where he is going in his filmmaking path. All I have to say about this movie is, give it a chance. Some of it is real corny, but the performances between Wahlberg and Mara really make it worth it. Also, a very awesome Michael Pena too. I was pleasantly surprised by both production value and action set pieces. Well done!
B000YAYIXQ|5.0|Im fairly new to Amy Winehouse have a couple of her tracks on a recommendation from a friend was looking for more from her cause I was liking what I had... found this cd and now im her newest bestest fan can't stop listening to this cd it's just a dam good cd really love the Mr. Magic track jazzy, soulful. If you thinking bout getting this cd  stop thinking just get it and you'll be playing it over& over too.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app has so many great ideas for everyone regardless of your interest or age.<br />There is something for everyone
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I have read the whole series almost twice and I have loved every book. All the characters are wonderful and full of life. I like that each characters has their own story but it all ties in.
B0056CUZRA|5.0|excellent reading and able to learn a lot about the war and the different countrys I would recommend it for a good read.
0240815807|4.0|I learned a lot with this book. It balances well medium-easy and medium-hard stuff. It isn´t basic, in my oppinion. Maybe it can be basic to Engineers, but not so for newbies. I read it once and, while I was reading, sometimes I goten angry, but at the end, the final impression, was very good. It must be studied with the vast online material. It´s a living book. Thank you Mike!<br /><br />As I´m brazilian, sometimes the language used by author isn´t easy to comprehend. Jokes and slangs aren´t easy for outsiders. I think he was trying to be funny, and he is funny, as the pieces I could understand. If you are an international buyer, this book could be a little challenging, but you at least you can expand your vocabulary.  See, it´s my experience. I never lived outside Brazil. But I read a lot in English (I´m not a writter as you can see).<br /><br />That´s all folks!
0307950689|5.0|I really enjoyed this book more than Brown's other books, because it's set in America in our nation's Capitol and tells the readers about some pretty esoteric stuff that is right under every Americans nose. Look forward to Inferno!
B000000XB9|5.0|it's great, don't think about it, enjoy it. good price, good service. I would advice every credence fan to purchase it.
B00005UW7V|5.0|This is one of those movies that you can watch again. Not only is it a futuristic film but it's also a drama. Definately a movie for both guys & gals.
B00B69UQEO|4.0|I am actually going to their concert on Sept. 15 so I bought this as a bday present for my husband.  This is our favorit band of all time and we really enjoy anything they do.  Maybe not full of hits like Violator, Exciter, etc. but definitely a good buy.
B00BGIBVRG|4.0|Apatow takes another stab at what it means to be a grown up.  In This is 40 he delivers a clever and highly entertaining portrayal of the day-to-day insecurities, financial hardships, relationship and parenting struggles, and general mid-life crises of his characters.  I really enjoyed it and laughed out loud through the majority of it.  It will occasionally make you cringe--sometimes due to crudeness-- but many times due to the raw close-to-homeness of the situational comedy.
B005M2V2K8|5.0|My grandson love these, they are well made and durable. They have a cat toss event and these little guys hold up well. Boos does some nice aerial acts.
B000IDGBWU|4.0|The songs are not from my childhood but the movie is and it always brings me back to a sweet period where life was more innocent and first love was the biggest thing in the world
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I can't say enough about this book.  I loved it from the moment my eyes grazed over the first words.  I've loved video games all my life and when I was a kid, I dreamed of virtual reality, but the OASIS blew the dreams away.  The world of the book was so thoughtfully constructed and articulately rendered that I settled right into it, just like Wade did into his haptic chair.  The social commentary added the fire that all great books have and the challenge felt real.  Having spent my very young childhood in the 80's, I also loved the theme of the contest and Halliday's interests.  So, this book should be read.  Warning: it's as addictive as any good video game can be.
0143038583|5.0|Only into the first chapter but I love it so far.  I do not doubt that the rest of the book will be good.
B001F0WXY0|5.0|Some have claimed that Frank Herbert's Dune is a &#34;philosophy book&#34;, that &#34;it is pretentious garbage&#34; And what do I think about its many critics and their criticisms? Short answer: I don’t.<br /><br />What is Dune? Dune is a wonderful story. I can’t even guess at the effort and thought Frank Herbert had to go through to create this level of world-building. If ever a world was “fully imagined,” I believe it’s the world of Dune. But I will say this: Dune takes itself very, very seriously. Sometimes a paragraph will contain one, three, or maybe six “big gigantic thoughts.” And by BGTs, I mean the kind of thoughts that philosophers write entire books about.<br /><br />Give it a try, you won't regret it.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|I'm glad I'm not watching this in &#34;real time&#34; on cable, because I don't like waiting to see the next episode.
1616550414|5.0|It's a perfect book to someone who love the Zelda's History! I Recommend for ever! Beautifull Book. It's a Biblia Of The Legend.
B0083Z614S|5.0|It was great because it had a lot of  mystery  to  it  I love. Very nice to me I love  it
B00BRYDKM8|4.0|I started getting interested in public speaking a year ago, and since then I've been eager to read and listen every advice to become a good speaker and an influencial leader. This book contains a lot of very effective and powerful suggestion to accomplish this.  However I didn't find many innovative approaches from what I already learned from other sources. The author is very good at transmitting these ideas in a very clear and concise way, and illustrates them with good and simple examples. I wish there were more examples though! Overall, I would recommend this book to those that are interested in an introduction to public speaking.
034580404X|3.0|One book would have been enough.  Book two could have answered many questions but, of course, didn't so a third.  Read the third book first and you'll figure it all out.
145210655X|5.0|Loved seeing how Vader would have handled some situations.  I also purchased the Vader and Leia book, it was just as cute.
B009HUB40Y|3.0|I only played this a few days off n on.<br />I'm really just learning right now so I honestly can not rate it a 5 star of yet. I will give it a 3 because it seems fun n I haven't had any issues myself.<br />My 13 year old daughter played it on Saturday n really took a liking to the game so I will check it out for a few more days n see how it goes.... if I like it later I will be back to rate GOOD if I don't I will be back to rate it a 1 or tell you how it sucks lol.<br />Tnx...
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|Wonderfully written.  All of her books transport the reader into that other realm!  So easy to read yet impossible to put down!
B00A8ECU24|1.0|ever since the new update I cant play at all. Thanks for nothing. Not only because of this I have wasted my time but money as well.  Fix it asap or don't even create new games if you cant handle the work of maintaining them. You suck!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Great ideas; some show plans and how it is done which is really great some is trial and error; I have tried several recipes and things I have found on Pinterest and all have been great except for maybe 1-2 that didn't work as well as I would of liked...
B0063M22QO|5.0|Best memory game that keeps you wanting to play non stop. Very additive and you find it makes you want go to the next levels.
1423140591|4.0|It is in great shape and I like to order my books this way because they are so much cheaper or you can find books that are no longer sold in stores.
0385536828|4.0|My book group chose this book, and I determined to read it, even<br />though I'm not generally a fan of \\"postmodern\\" British fiction.  I was<br />not entirely convinced by McEwan's portrayal of Serena as a young<br />woman of the 1970s -- her inner life seemed lacking, as she had few<br />genuine interests and pleasures.  No woman in our culture truly thinks<br />she's \\"very pretty\\", without qualifications and exceptions!  Her<br />motivations in choosing men remained a bit opaque to me.  And for<br />an attractive young woman she was remarkably unpursued at a time when<br />men should have been coming on to her constantly.<br /><br />I like the way the British class thing was made abundantly clear, as I<br />often find it mystifying to try to \\"read\\" what class characters are<br />meant to be, and what that means to them and to the other characters.<br />Here that is laid out nicely.  The whole secret spy theme was very<br />much of its time, in the early 70's, when spy stories, movies, and TV<br />shows were a very common thing.  It is a great metaphor for the<br />secretiveness and deceptiveness of so many human relationships.  In<br />general I didn't feel that McEwan gave me a strong sense of early<br />1970's swinging London.<br /><br />As other reviews have indicated, there's an amazing zinger at the end,<br />that seemed to change the entire book for me, as I had the dizzying<br />feeling that I hadn't been reading the book I thought I was reading.<br />This is apparently a typical element in postmodern \\"metafictive\\"<br />works, as is the book's being about writing.  The book has given me<br />an interest in McEwan's other works.<br /><br />It's not a quick or easy read, although it isn't dense or long.  It<br />took me about a week, but I was glad I had lingered over it.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Really enjoyed this book.  Good constant pace.  It was more like a manual for any company director.  Putting out spot fires!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This book is one of the hidden gems , and it's way too under-priced.<br />In this little book you can find the how and the why of the energy.<br />Included experiments are simple on the outside, but they have deep personal impact when you do them.<br /><br />I have known most of the things in the book from different sources for a long time, but thanks to this book and to the mentioned experiments,<br />I have managed to break through some serious personal blocks.<br /><br />If you are vaguely self aware and feel that you can do better in your life, do yourself a favour, just buy the book , read it, do the experiments and watch the magic unfolds.<br /><br />I can not overstate the impact experiments from this book had on me.
B0011XBLUS|5.0|It's iconic for a reason.  The setting, excellent, the characters, excellent, the jokes, excellent, the premise, excellent. the story line, excellent.  And Clint sure does look good in this one.  Oh, yeah!
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|This game offers great missions, they are really fun. But the game is not long enough, I beat it in a week. Other than that if your a fan of sandbox/free roaming games you will love this.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|BATMAN!!! A welcomed end to the Nolan batman trilogy. I'm glad they left it open for other directors (or Nolan) to move forward with the Batman Saga.
B005COO1X6|5.0|Along with storm drains, cell phones, clowns and St Bernards, I will avoid dirty cars parked on the side of the road. Classic King.
0345803507|4.0|If you are looking for another fifty shades of grey, you won't find it here.  While James is a great sex writer, the sex thing is over done as it is obvious that sex is what drove the first in the series.  Unfortunately for us readers, the author does not kick things up a notch with anything truly clever and thus relies on the sex scenes to uphold a series of books.
0525958002|4.0|Bought this as a present for my wife who is a big Double D fan.  She read it in about three nights.  She didn't say a lot about it but did say that it was good.  She did agree with other reviewers that it appeared that a significant amount was left untold as to not upset other band members.  I suppose that would be expected as they are still together.
B0012QVJXS|5.0|Brought me and my son together as superman is the latest fascination. A great Sunday for both of us.  Awesome.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy to use and I do --all the time.<br />One more reason to love my Kindle Fire (and take it with me everywhere I go).
0670014893|5.0|I just finished reading John LeCarre's &#34;A Delicate Truth&#34;. Le Carre is my favorite author and I thought this was one of his best books.  As good as &#34;A Perfect Spy&#34;.
1416596585|3.0|I was excited to own and read this book. It turned out to be a big story after story narrative on Google employees. I did not get much out of it. It is more a documentation of what they are doing. People who work in non technical may find it too intense and complicated; people who work in tech industry will feel the same things they go through in excruciating details.<br /><br />I was excited to read based on Steven Levy's previous books. But it turned out to be a drab and I could not find much unifying theme other than common wisdom.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Great movie, good action and loved the plot. Rossario Dawson is gorgeous, simply gorgeous. Tom Cruise is excellent in this movie.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|User experience on facebook is still needs lot of polish. Why there are no third party facebook clients?  They should open up the ecosystem and can have developers work on parsing the information. I am sure there will be tons of analytics and  data mining people can do.<br /><br />App as such is good, it feels like too many tabs, there is lot of potential to make a error in liking. Image displays is also not formatted properly when I used a Kindle HD. It is good, not great app.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|WOW. I  could not by  this book down! It flowed, kept me interested, made me feel happy and sad, excitement and the feeling of new love.<br /><br />This book is a true to life love story that takes you on Travis and Abby's journey to commitment. Good times and bad times, misunderstanding and untold words and feelings get in the way of moving forward. But they make it in the end.  Love will find a way :)
1455502626|4.0|I read Plum Island many years ago and enjoyed it very much. This was the first DeMille book that I read and since then I have read I think all of his other works with not a poor one amongst them. This copy was purchased as a present for a relative and is highly recommended.

B0074VTHKM|5.0|Great read.  I love all of John Grishams books.  I think I have read all of his books and look forward to more.
B009NY43NY|1.0|No offense to all my fellow book lovers on here, but I saw this train wreck coming 3-4 books ago and I quit buying.  I was already pissy about her switching the main love interest from Bill to Eric.  When I'm invested in a couple, it's hard for me to switch gears.  But, I loved the characters and stuck with it.  Then came the little soundbites here and there from the author--how Sookie was going to end up, that she had the same ending in mind from the beginning of the series.  Oh yeah.  I saw that Sam was at the end of the tunnel and I jumped ship.  SAM IS BO-RING! And the same holds true for Sam on True Blood--so HBO take notice! So, Charlaine, even though you CLEARLY do not care about the feelings of your fanbase, please just know that I am smirking over here in my little corner because you did not get my money on this book or even the last several.  Nope, that $ went to authors that are busy trying to *keep* their readers...
0385349947|3.0|I honestly do not know what drew me to this book.  In college I did a paper on women in leadership and was shocked to pull up statistic after statistic on how little we as a sex were represented.  After a terrible economic collapse and having three children, I became much more complacent to the gender bias.  I was simply grateful for steady work.  This well researched and tidy little book re-awakened some of the old fire in me.  The statistic about women being promoted based upon past achievements and men being promoted based on potential just floored me.  The books does a lot to start the discussion about gender perception and really calls attention to the problem.  And it is a definite problem.  Just look around your office, besides a token woman or two how many women hold leadership positions in your company.  What have the woman who hold those token positions had to sacrifice to get where they are?<br /><br />This is not pleasure reading.  You will not read this in one sitting.  The research is off putting and disheartening.  As for the specifics Sandberg incorporates, they are hard to swallow.  Sandberg has advantages that almost no one else can claim. Her cavalier attitude towards hiring a nanny or picking and choosing between one dream job or another is grating.  Her apparent lack of mistakes is also distancing.  Even her divorce is a learning opportunity.<br /><br />Will I ever have Sandberg's opportunities? Nope.  Can I make differences for future generations of women to claim their spot at the table?  Maybe minimally, perhaps indirectly.  Do I think some of this material should be required reading for all levels of management?  Absolutely.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|I thought it was a good story. I used to love Tom Cruise. Not so much anymore. Maybe another star.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book was a very interesting read.  Chris Kyle was a true American. The sacrifices our military personnel and their families  make can only be understood through experience.  RIP Chris Kyle, I am sure you did not have to stand at The Gate very long.
B0042J6VUS|2.0|I bought this product for my Samsung Galaxy SIII since it said Other cellphones.  The product holds the phone by using a spring loaded lever on top which is about a quarter inch too short.  Trying to fit the phone in the holder the top popped off.  Additionally the spring came off.  I was able to fix the spring by pulling off the bottom, putting the spring back on, adding foam to hold the spring on.  Additionally, I added a small screw to hold the top tab on and heated the top tab and deformed it so it was about a quarter inch taller to barely fit my phone.  Once I fixed all of these items I was separating the legs on the tripod and the legs fell out.  I was able to push them back in but they do not say in very well.  I was talking to a friend of mine who also bought one of these tripods for use with a smaller phone and he also had a problem with the top popping off and the spring comming off.  I would have given it a lower review but I was able to make it work with a lot of effort.  It is not a bad price if you are looking for another project.
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|This is the 2d of hers I've read -- and I like them.  She builds on dialogue and character.  I will read the third one.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This book really took be back to being a pre-teen and enjoying Judy Blume novels which were supposed to teach me it was okay to be scared, nervous and worried about whatever fill-in-the-blank issue that a preteen girl generally worries about.  The author here took the same tact and applied it to juvenile cancer.  The story line did get a little hinky towards the end but hey, they are getting a movie out of it, right?
0670022705|5.0|I bought this because a friend of mine highly recommended it to me. You can read it in order or just pick a random object to read about it.<br /><br />After I saw it I had to order 3 more as Christmas gifts for some friends, including my boss, and had great reactions. You just can't go wrong with this one: it serves just as well as a coffe table book than as a deep reading experience.
193700788X|2.0|I have been a long time fan of both the Sookie Stackhouse books and the HBO show True Blood. There have been times that I have watched the TV series and have been disappointed that they strayed from Charlaine's books, and there have been times I have been happy to see some of the changes to the characters(Tara and Lafayette of course). This last book was a surprise and a let down for me and I was left confused by the ending. I read several reviews on Amazon t see what other fans thought and many articulated how I felt. I agree that Sam was never a serious rival for Sookie's affection. His character never persued her or fought for her. Eric's character showed that he felt more for Sookie then just \\"affection\\" but in the end he was reduced to merely that emotion. Sookie's character never reacted so passively over Eric's behavior and it didnt seem like she would roll over with his leaving the way she did. The whole feeling of the book was....disjointed. It did not feel in line with the rest of the series. On a side note, why did Charlaine feel the need to mention Sookies garden and tomatoes no less then 12 times???? I would have felt better about the ending if Sookie's character had gotten back together with Bill or Quinn or even Alcide. That being said, who knows these characters better then the writer? If she says that's the way it happened, then it happened that way.
B004FRX0MY|1.0|I love this player until I learned that I could not store offline music on my external sdcard. The streaming is also horrible for low bandwidth, while Pandora still streams well.<br /><br />I have a MetroPCS 4G plan with a 250Mb/month limit. When I am below my limit streaming is good however, when Metro starts to throttle my band width because I have exceeded my limit, streaming is intermittent(not usable). However, during these \\"low band width\\" condition, Pandora still streams extremely well, seems that Amazon could fix this!<br /><br />As a work around I decided to store locally, however I noticed that YOU CANT store on your external sdcard. At this point I have stopped purchasing from Amazon MP3. I would love it, if they could fix the external storage problem. Since you are forced to store on your phone's internal flash memory, you quickly start having issues with system performance (ie no space for mail..and so forth).<br /><br />Great product if you have unlimited 4G. Hopefully Amazon can fix these issues.
1439153663|5.0|You will love some of the characters in this book. The story will remind you there are evil, twisted people in this world, and also some very loving and decent ones.

0385523912|5.0|I can't recommend this book highly enough. In the months since I read it I have purchased several copies for friends. The people the author profiled in this book were very engaging and their stories were all touching and incredibly interesting. The courage displayed in this book was inspiring. I knew things were bad in NK but this book really was a complete eye opener and I found after reading this that I wanted more books on North Korea because it was so interesting. Great book.

0978545095|5.0|Vivian Maier has been an inspiration to me. Ever since seeing the first exhibit of her photos I have been out snapping like a madwoman. This would be a great gift for any photography lover. Since the discovery of her work is still relatively new, this could be an excellent gift for someone who already has a large selection of photography books. I enjoy her view of Chicago and am so happy to have this book in my collection.

B009ZZDNT6|4.0|I bought this app because I got tried of my cellphone as a alarm clock. I started with the free version, that was satisfactory so I upgraded. I am surprised about how much I love this app!! Very easy to use and it looks great too! And I wasn't really expecting much from the white noise feature since I've used white noise before without success. This works like a charm, perhaps it's that 40 minute default setting, one less the to be anxious about. But also the comfort of knowing that you can change to longer or shorter periods of white noise if you want to.

B009AJD5E0|5.0|This movie is nothing like the original Alien series but it still connects with the Alien storyline.  This movie is a philosophical/sci-fi story rather than a bloody horror movie and I enjoyed it much more than I enjoyed the entire Alien franchise.<br /><br />Alot of the people that hate this movie in my opinion are in two groups.<br /><br />Group #1 - Expected this to be a recycled Alien film where there is a group of people stuck on a spaceship with an alien who eventually hunts down and kills everyone but the main protagonist of the story.  Group #1 are just upset that this movie was not what they were expecting but I welcomed the changes ecstatically.  I thought it was genius how they managed to re-invent the entire Alien universe, and not only that, but they expanded it and made it deeper and much more interesting.<br /><br />Group #2 - State that the film had way too many plot holes and too many questions left unanswered.  I say - that was the point!  Prometheus was partially designed to leave the viewer wondering about certain things in the story which makes the film more attractive in my opinion.  The mystery surrounding certain aspects in Prometheus draws the viewer in and invites him/her to speculate on the possibilities.  I cannot believe people are complaining because not every little detail about the story was explained.  The mysterious nature of the film enhances it greatly.<br />  Group #2 also likes to makes a big fuss about how the characters make really bad decisions.  Was this the first film that you saw in which the characters did or said stupid things.  I hate to remind you, but it is a film, so the characters are allowed to do all that.  If you are going to make a fuss about those things then you should probably make a fuss about every other movie as well because they are all like that.<br /><br />Prometheus was fantastic and one of the best sci-fi films ever.  The story was very well put together and kept me in my seat to see what would happennext.  Great actors, great special effects and it has aliens in it!  What more could you ask for?

How right they are!<br /><br />We have reviewed this excellent work in the past and we are delighted to recommend the Legal Action Group's new `Legal Aid Handbook 2013/14' as the most useful of all the publications available on the market to explain what is happening to the legal aid world during the economic downturn.<br /><br />The handbook is supported by a website called legalaidhandbook dot com which is regularly updated with news and alerts.  As with all LAG publications, the case studies, hints and checklists are essential for both support staff and lawyers alike and this handbook does save us a great deal of time trying to fathom how the scheme works.<br /><br />In 350 pages plus the appendices including LASPO, the practitioner is given a clear outline of the framework of current legal aid from 2013 which all lawyers should refer to in view of the massive changes taking place within the system. The step by step guides throughout the book make this an invaluable title and it may possibly save you a great deal of time in averting returned claim forms from the new LAA.<br /><br />Perhaps of greatest benefit for the practitioner are the chapter specific areas covering the different substantive law rules: private and public family law; crime; immigration/asylum; mental health and mediation.<br /><br />The task which Ling, Pugh and Edwards, have pursued has not been undertaken lightly and they are all to be congratulated on giving members of the legal profession the best overview possible of the formidable legal aid rules, and most of what we need is here.<br /><br />As others have said- it's always going to be on the desk as the main point of reference... more so now with the continuing complexities which make up modern legal aid.  Thank you to all concerned for giving us this new edition at such an important crossroads for the scheme.ing to be on the desk as the main point of reference... more so now with the continuing complexities which make up modern legal aid.  Thank you to all concerned for giving us this new edition at such an important crossroads for the scheme.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|The thing I love about this book is the author. He is a very scientifically oriented neurosurgeon. And he has been given the privilege to see and report on the far greater reality of the spiritual realm, that part of reality that is not, and probably cannot, be subjected to the scientific method. And he is a believer. And his belief is based upon the evidence he has been permitted to see. And he describes it in scientific terms, at least as far as it is possible to do that. I especially appreciate what he says, because I have been saying the same things about that realm. I say it in theological terminology. I am a Pastor Emeritus, still actively serving a small parish. I do not need the evidence this book gives to bolster my faith. But, i found it so heart-warming for him to describe the utter expanse of the spiritual realm, and the absolute unconditional love of the Creator. Read this book with an open mind, and read it slowly and carefully, pondering every word. I believe that God has used this man in a very special way to reach people with His love, people who would probably never be reached by a church or a clergy person. GOD BLESS!!!

This is a book for the professional and the layman alike written by people in the forefront of this area of law. As with all LAG books, this is another very user-friendly, informative title and with sufficient attention to detail throughout identifying the rules, the pitfalls and, in chapter 17, practice and procedure.<br /><br />Discrimination is never an easy subject even though many clients may feel that it is when you see them first in Conference to discuss their grievances.  Don't feel shy about using a LAG book as they are, in many ways the best. `Discrimination in Employment' is a treasure trove of advice with many individual nuggets of information to steer you away from the obvious blind alleys.<br /><br />As Allen says at the beginning, the law in this area does change so the Cloisters dot com website will keep you up to date with developments and this is a real boon to save practitioners time.<br /><br />Rightly, and very much in tune with the mission LAG have (and for which we are extremely grateful), this book is very easy to read and navigate.  The longer term effects and implications of the consolidated Equality Act need continued careful consideration and this book gives the best practical advice on how to tackle this difficult and emotional subject. Thank you to all the contributors and to LAG for giving us this claims handbook.ibutors and to LAG for giving us this claims handbook.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I could imagine that by the time one gets to the fourteenth book in a series, they are going to love it no matter what. Still, it was the only book I haven't been able to put down since.... well, the one before it, and I am not disappointed in any way with how the story was resolved.
0199656134|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo2LJ7BXJP1G4YK]]<br /><br />AT LAST THERE'S A COMPREHENSIVE BOOK ON CASE LAW<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />One of the latest publications from Oxford University Press, `Professional Conduct Casebook' is a comprehensive and up-to-date compendium of case law in the area of regulatory and disciplinary procedures pertaining to the professions, from law, medicine and accounting to financial services, the police, the prison services and sport.<br /><br />Bearing in mind that the increase in disciplinary cases is likely to continue, the time is opportune for a new law book devoted to reporting all the relevant cases decided by the senior courts, as author Kenneth Hamer explains.  `Case studies,' he adds, `are at the heart of this book'.<br /><br />The book's utility and accessibility as a handy work of reference is enhanced by the fact that the case law is grouped together alphabetically over 68 chapters which cover everything from absence of the practitioner and abuse of process to voluntary erasure... whistleblowing... witnesses... and words and phrases.  Findings of fact, costs, delay, dishonest, misconduct and negligence figure prominently in this list - and these, of course, are only a few examples.<br /><br />Clearly, the content of the book has been organised with the needs of the busy practitioner in mind.  As the author points out, the object of the book is to cover those aspects of practice and procedure that arise in the course of professional conduct proceedings, either at hearings before disciplinary committees or fitness to practice panels, or on appeal.<br /><br />Conveniently for the practitioner under pressure, most chapters begin with a short legal framework followed by a listing of the more significant cases in date order, as well as cross references to other relevant chapters.<br /><br />All of which makes the book ideal not just for lawyers, but for any advisor professionally involved in professional fitness to practice proceedings across a range of areas from healthcare and education to the police and military.<br /><br />For those interested in further research, the book offers massive resources, with over forty pages of tables of cases, legislation, statutory instruments, international treaties and conventions and professional rules and guidance, not to mention a handy list of abbreviations, directory of regulatory bodies and an index at the back.<br /><br />Without doubt this is an indispensable reference book destined to become an essential acquisition for anyone involved in professional conduct cases.  Cases included are those that have been decided by the courts up to 1st November 2012.fessionally involved in professional fitness to practice proceedings across a range of areas from healthcare and education to the police and military.<br /><br />For those interested in further research, the book offers massive resources, with over forty pages of tables of cases, legislation, statutory instruments, international treaties and conventions and professional rules and guidance, not to mention a handy list of abbreviations, directory of regulatory bodies and an index at the back.<br /><br />Without doubt this is an indispensable reference book destined to become an essential acquisition for anyone involved in professional conduct cases.

B00COHIFQS|4.0|Tense scenes and adding children into this movie makes it even more suspenseful. The unfortunate part of this movie as in most horror movies is the ending. Really good, but the ending fell short of making this a great movie.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|just when you think the book is predictable and unsure you want to finish it it has many twists that keep you riveted to the book
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I found this to be a pretty enjoyable book. The writer did a very thorough job in my opinion on closing most holes and creating a very complex and complete storyline that can be seen indirectly throughout the interviews. I liked that it was different then other zombie books with the 'interview' sort of style. BUT, on the flip side, I did find myself having trouble finishing the last quarter of the book. I think this was mostly because there was no attachment to any particular character and while I enjoyed reading it I wasn't necessarily chomping at the bit to find out what went on next.
1449437524|5.0|This coffee table book is a must-have for any dog owner!  Bought 3 - 1 for me, and 2 as gifts for friend.  I shared this with my coworkers and 2 of them already purchased three of their own for gifts!

B0044WUQ3G|4.0|Though the movie is called: Frozen, it is more about emotional breakdowns. There is no real gore in this flick, but it does make you think \\"what if?\\" For horror, I gave it a four because it is more a mental state rather than a slash them up movie. I want it for my collection.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This was the most inspiring book I've read so far this year.  Good perspective on the problems we women face and great suggestions for how we can help change the work culture.  Don't just complain - Lean In!

B002RVCD6O|5.0|I got hooked on Harry Potter after watching the Philosopher's Stone in London with my nephew. I watched the first few movies and then the ones after as they came out. My sister-in-law then got me to read the books. I was so enthralled with them that I finished books 1 - 4 in one week !!! I am saddened to see this series come to an end, however I now have my son into it. He has seen all the movies (at the age of 8) and I have begun reading the books to him (we are on book 3 right now). He loves playing Ron and Harry with his cousin when they get together. He has his own wand (Ron's). And I love the things that the books teach him... perseverance, friendship, the power of love, and the thought that you must have faith in yourself. Thank you J.K. Rowling !!!

0439023521|4.0|A good overall read. Mainly the prose and characterization set this novel out, though some of it seemed too far fetched to be plausible for me. How children who know they are likely marching to their deaths remain relatively sane is beyond me.
0061367036|1.0|The summary/headline says it all ..... Had hoped for so much more from this book ...<br />Can't and Won't recommend fellow fans to buy it.
193700788X|4.0|There are over 1000 reviews up already, and judging by those comments that I have read, many of the reviewers are seeing this book, and presumably the entire series, through the lens of the tv. I have never seen an episode, largely because I just can't buy Anna Paquin in the role. Anna Paquin is a fine actress, but to me, Anna Paquin is not Sookie Stackhouse. Scarlett Johansson is Sookie Stackhouse (or maybe Kate Upton...).<br /><br />Similarly, Eric. I never liked Eric. Eric, it seems, is a fan favorite of tv fans, but the Eric depicted in the novels has always been self-absorbed and manipulative. He seemed to honestly care about Sookie, but he cared about his position in vampire society (and his career) more. Eric had doubts about his relationship with Freyda, but in the end, he seemed happy enough to go off with her to Oklahoma, where his stature, wealth and power would grow.<br /><br />Sam has always been there for Sookie, and while their romance seems to blossom rather suddenly in this book, it was foreshadowed right from the beginning. Sookie, perhaps because of her fae blood, loves sunlight, growing things and the outdoors. A vampire's life was never what she wanted. I might have preferred that she wind up with Quinn, but he seems to have picked up a significant other, who is now pregnant. I'm not sure how I missed this in previous books, but Sookie seems to know all about it and the two are now friendly.<br /><br />This book certainly had weaknesses. For one thing, Amelia's father sells his soul to the devil for a wish. He wishes for Sookie's cluviel d'or, which has the power to grant one wish. But he didn't need the cluviel d'or if the devil could grant him the same wish. Also, the whole arc of the series is, in the end, just a bit disappointing. Bill, who started out as a major character, has receded into the background. The world of Bon Temps, after all that has happened, goes on with little change. Sookie has had numerous adventures, escapes and experiences, and she winds up pretty much where she started. I might have expected a little more growth, but this is, I have to admit, a minor criticism. Many protagonists, in the end, wind up realizing that they want what they always had. Sookie's fate is a time honored one. She is home, where she always wanted to be.

B00280LYIC|4.0|Anyone from about nine or ten years of age on up should be able to enjoy this book.  It's a fun, fast-paced story that's a breeze to get through, a modern-day fantasy of sorts involving the Greek gods from ancient mythology and a 12-year-old named Percy Jsckson.  Helps to know who is who and what is what in that world, but by no means is it essential.  Rick Riordan does a masterful job of explaining everything the reader needs to know.
B002JIEYLC|1.0|I was debating whether I should purchase this version as an imported CD or the main one listed on Amazon.  Then I noticed that this one had one bonus song, a live version of Sweet Leaf.  I made the decision to purchase this version to get the bonus song.  Well, this CD does not contain a live version of Sweet Leaf or any version of that song at all.  I feel ripped off.  I am not giving this a 1 star review to criticize Black Sabbath in any way.  I just want people to know that if they are considering this import CD vs. the regular CD, they will not receive any bonus songs.  This is false advertising.

B00BUADSMQ|2.0|John McClaine is back in this 5th installment of the Die Hard franchise that lazily has him in Russia. There he teams with his son Jack (Jai Courtney) to stop some Russian bad guys. Jack doesn't want his dad there who he of course just calls John and not dad, like his sister in the previous film. Can John and Jack make up and bond while killing bad guys with machine guns ?<br />  The film just feels rushed, uninspired and only exists for money.  There's tons of action but none of it is involving or puts us at the edge of our seats. While, the villain was the weakest, even compared to Timothy Olyphant's. Part 6 needs better writing and a better director, us fans deserve better. But instead they'll probably rush production and hire McG or Brett Ratner to direct and give John a whiny nephew who doesn't like shirts played by Taylor Lautner.
B00BGIC2J2|3.0|Just like evey other Judd Apatow movie, you're going to have to see this. There are several jokes that will have you dying. With that said it is remarkably smug and leans REALLY hard on the sharp, nuanced chemistry of the famliy.  I felt that they were trying a little too hard with BOTH sets of grandparents having new families as well as backstories that seem to be a little contrived. But I'm guessing it was a great way to throw in twists while providing slots for this star studded comedy. Oh and that guy from the Super Nintendo commercial was great.
B007PBL9KC|4.0|This is a great Freshman effort by these guys, yes I know they have EP's out but I don't consider those actual releases.  The 5 hits on this album are very catchy and good songs with a lot of replay ability.  The other songs are quite nice as well, and are very enjoyable to listen to between the hits.  If you can get this for less than $11 bucks, pick up the whole album, if more you might want to purchase the individual songs you like the best.
B0071BGOJC|5.0|This book is an excellent follow-up to the first in the trilogy.<br />I am sorry we have to wait until 2014 for No 3.
B00ATP24NW|3.0|This is a good freshman effort for these guys, unfortunately the 4 or 5 hits (one of them I actually do not like, Radioactive) are really the only good songs on it, so unless you catch one of the deals where you can pick it up for less than $9 I would suggest just purchasing the singles you want and leaving the rest behind.  Especially when you consider you have to purchase the extended, more pricey recording to get the second best song on the album, America.  If all the songs were as good as the least likable hit I would have given it a 4 to 5 but, as is they are not, so it only gets a 3 from me.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Fantastic read!!! This book had so many aspects to it that made Sky and Holder who they are. I'd give this book ten stars if I could!
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Excellent!  Love it . Cant stop watching!!!! Actors are great and same from last season!! Thanks to all the writers!!
B003JTHXOK|3.0|Safe Haven was definitely slow to start, but got moving eventually. If you're looking for an invigorating book to inspire and question, you should probably keep moving. However, if you're looking for an easy book to read by the pool, this would be a good choice.<br /><br />It's a pretty basic story line, very predictable, and cheesy, but it keeps you occupied and leaves you feeling good in the end.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|This has been a great read so far. Although it is a teenage type read, I'm enjoying it.  What can I say?  I liked the Hunger Games series as well..
193700788X|1.0|I was angry when I finished reading this book.  It was such a waste of time.  I have read some of Ms. Harris' s Sookie short stories which were better developed plot wise than this.  I honestly found myself talking to the book and asking \\"What just happened?\\"  I think it would have been better to just have ended writing about Sookie with the last book, and picked it up again when the author was not feeling so fatigued with the character.  What we were given was not worthy of this author, the series or the readers.  If I could give it half a star I would.
B001NLL8LA|5.0|It has all the attributes of a really good book by Lee Child.  He doesn't disappoint his readers.  And I recommend it.
B00CDT41RY|2.0|Excessively violent and profane which is the Hollywood template. The Academy awards must have been for number of gallons of blood spattered across the screen and the most use of the N word.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|First off, the show is great, and I enjoyed the second season in particular.<br /><br />I've only watched the blu-ray discs from this set.  I'm not really sure why they bundle the dvds with these and I haven't yet bothered with the digital copy, but the blu-rays are great.  Picture's good, sound's good.  Even the special features are worth watching.  Unless you can pick up digital copies of the season for $5 or $10 less, I would definitely recommend the blu-ray version.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This is the best keyboard app, by far. Intuitive, responsive, accurate, and sleek. I would highly recommend it. Simply the best.
B00BB22GQM|3.0|It's clear that Vampire Weekend wanted to go in a different direction with this album.  Many people will reward them for that, citing the \\"evolve or die\\" argument.  But if you were a fan of Vampire Weekend's first two albums (as I am) and excited for this new release (as I was), there's the potential for massive disappointment here.<br /><br />My primary source of disappointment (and the reason I decided to become the first 3* reviewer) is the total absence of notable guitar work on the album.  As a guitar player, I'm obviously biased, but I feel like Vampire Weekend had a few hallmarks to their sound that make them identifiable as a band.  One of those is the \\"faux harpsichord\\" progressions, which still appear on this album.  They also have some beautiful piano parts layered underneath Ezra's vocals.  But the guitar riffs - a variety of vintage, almost \\"surf\\"-like undertones - are almost completely gone, and that was one of my favorite aspects of Vampire Weekend's music.  Take virtually any notable VW song (A-Punk, Oxford Comma, Holiday, Cousins, etc.), and there is heavy guitar work that makes up the identity of those songs.  (The beautiful piano work on \\"Taxi Cab\\" would be a notable exception to this rule).  That VW has chosen to virtually eliminate guitar from the formula and become more a piano/electronic band doesn't make them \\"bad\\", but takes away an important element of what made them great.<br /><br />As a secondary complaint, I would note that there's real lack of energy in this album.  It reminds me a lot of all the things wrong with U2's \\"No Line on the Horizon\\" - excellent musicianship, but ask yourself an important question: \\"Had this been the FIRST album from this band, would anyone have noticed them through the crowd?\\".  It's possible to make a \\"darker\\" album without compromising the energy and formula that made your band appealing in the first place.<br /><br />My view appears to be a minority opinion, but I thought the first two albums were 5* all the way.  I'm 31 and I didn't consider them to be \\"immature\\" records in any sense.  I will stick with the album to see if it \\"grows\\", but normally when you hope for an album to \\"grow\\" on you, you're basically waiting for it to become something it's not.<br /><br />There's an assumption out there that individual bands need to \\"grow up\\" with us and become more serious and contemplative with us, as we presumably are also doing with age.  I don't agree with that.  I think that notable bands and artists \\"stand\\" for something, and allow you to seek that out if that's a mood or sentiment you want to experience.  It's possible for a band to start as something and become something else.  U2 has been everything from a Christian band to an Electronic/Dance band.  But if you want \\"something different\\", nobody's putting a gun to your head and forcing you to play Vampire Weekend.  Summers in Cape Cod are nowhere to be found on \\"Modern Vampires\\", and I kind of miss it.the way.  I'm 31 and I didn't consider them to be \\"immature\\" records in any sense.

B005HJU7HA|5.0|Damn, I love these stories! Sir Arthur Conan Doyle really was a genius & way ahead of his time!  Excellent narratives, unexpected plot twists, unique characters ~ what more can I say? Classically brilliant, even 130+ years later; imitated by many, literary equality achieved by so few. Holmes & Watson ~ God's way of demonstrating to avid mystery readers He loves us!<br /><br />P.S. is it just me, or do Holmes & Watson appear to be more than just friends & investigative partners? The only improve-ment gleaned from writing these stories in present day over that of 1880's is that Sir Doyle could have said so out right. Clearly Holmes loved Watson very much!
B00821PCJS|4.0|In this post apocalyptic alienfest the biggest criticism I had was the acting. Often not near believable the acting was what one comes to expect from most TNT original series. However for any scifi geeks like myself there should be enough intrigue in the plot itself to very through at least the first season and that's more than can be said for many shows on television those days.

B007IXWKUK|3.0|I had heard all kinds of reviews for these books,  I had to read them to comment.  Not literature, but entertaining to read during my kids swimming lessons.  I didn't need to pay attention to the reading half the time they spent on e mails and the other in bed.

B003K1EYM6|5.0|This little thing is the cats &#34;meow&#34;.  It is such a cool tool, works like a dream, even for a dummy like me...just plug it in and it knows what to do....is compact, easy to travel with, and fits all the iPads....love it like crazy.  Took a vacation with family...my sister had one in her bag, had never used it, was a gift from her hubby and said, &#34;here, try this&#34; and instantly fell in love with it and needed my own.  If you have a camera and an iPad, you need one of these gadgets.
B007K8ILTW|5.0|Whether you were inclined or disinclined to cozy to director Stanley Kubrick there is no denying that he was a unique visionary artist who was unimatable.  The common thread I see in these reviews is that \\"Fear and Desire\\" is a work of a novice director on a low budget.  I will agree that Kubrick had limited resources but I would argue that he made the most of what little was made available to him.  The theme of the brutality of war and the dehumanizing effects it has in those engaged in it comes across loud and clear and this is a piece with \\"Paths of Glory\\" and \\"Full Metal Jacket\\" where budgets weren't as much of a concern.  It's pretty daring when you consider that the U.S. had only been removed from World War II a scant eight years and were now engaged in the Cold War.  If there is any flaw here it may be in the script by Howard Sackler which is a bit heavy handed.  Kubrick compensates, however, by projecting stark images on the screen that sear themselves to your soul.  The story here is of two unidentified combatants one being a group of soldiers crashlanded in enemy territory trying to claw there way back to their home base.  The scene where the group slaughter their opposites while they are consuming cold stew will leave your draw drop.  Another powerful scene is when the men kidnap and tie a peasant girl to a tree and leave a green private to guard her while they look for a raft they misplaced.  The private played by Paul Mazursky, who would later become a renowned director in his own right, exhorts the girl to forgive him as he slowly descends into madness.  I also like the conceit that the actors who play the lieutenant and private from one side play the general and captain from the other side and voice the same reservations about the toll war takes on man's psyche.  I don't know if casting the same actors was an artistic stroke of genius or a budgetary constraint but it works.  It would be interesting if you screened this film for an audience who didn'tknow it was a work of Kubrick's and what their reaction would be.  Also included on this disc is \\"The Seafarers\\", a promotional film for the International Seafarers Union that Kubrick was hired to direct.  There is nothing artistic about this exercise other than as a tool to attract dues paying members to the union.  For Kubrick fans the only nuggets left out there are two short subjects he made prior to this film, \\"The Day of the Fight\\" and \\"The Flying Padre\\".

I have been to India before and I hope that you do not think that india is only represented by this movie. It is a truly wonderful country with a beautiful history and culture.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I thought this story was good.  It followed up on the Percy Jackson series by adding new characters and villains for freshness.  It is an easy read and hard to put down.
B009AMANH4|5.0|What a great movie, brought Abraham Lincoln to life, and very believable.  Daniel Day-Lewis and Sally Fields were<br />outstanding, and Spielberg has made another gem.  The beauty of this story is in it's timelessness, where our congress<br />is still fighting for themselves, instead for us...but politics aside,  I will look upon his monument with much more appreciation<br />for the man who may have been the most moral and brave president that we have had.........

B005S9EKCW|3.0|My daughter highly recommended this movie, my wife and I gave it just an OK...not our cup of tea, I guess.<br />We like musicals, but maybe this movie just swung way too much into the &#34;musical&#34;, where it almost seemed<br />silly to be singing , and the songs sounded awkward and almost laughable.  The sets and costumes were<br />outstanding, but somehow, we never really connected with this movie.....
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|This is an interpretation of the Stieg Larsson first novel and although there are some departures that ultimately work it is a gripping piece of work.  The interpretation of Lisbeth by Rooney Mara is particularly convincing.  She carries the right edge for the part. It is a shame she did not win the Oscar.
B000JMKTLO|2.0|I loved Gone Girl so I wanted to try more of G. Flynn's books.  This was very dark and depressing.  No redeeming qualities.  It is intriguing as you try to figure out the ending.

1469984202|5.0|It started with Wool... and has now moved into The Shift!  Heaven help me if I get caught in the web of the others!  It seemed innocent enough, yes?  It's just a book.  Another SciFi to entertain the imagination.  But don't be fooled!  Don't buy into the flagrant lies that you can pick up this book... or any of Hugh Howey's books... and maintain a normal life.  Oh sure, you'll lose weight... nobody even mentioned that in the reviews.  It's just a benefit of never putting the book down and having one less hand to feed yourself with.  Does anyone warn you of the lack of sleep?  Noooooo.  How could they?  They haven't stopped reading for days... maybe weeks.  Don't even bring up the whole which is worse, txt'ing or reading while driving conversation that I had with the police officer.  Seriously?  How many more times can I call into work ill with \\"sick family members\\" just because I can't stop at this point or that?  If someone took Minecraft and made it a book... it would be Hugh Howey!  One more block... one more block... one more block.  Or should that be... one more paragraph... one more page... one more chapter!  I think I need intervention. I need something dull to read to bring me back to normality.  I'm certainly not going to find that with any of Hugh's writing.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|The game spices up the original a lot.  There are in-game power-ups to purchase, but you don't have to get them to get to many levels of each game on your own.

B00A8MGLAI|1.0|The movie is great -- this is a review of the Blu-ray/DVD/UV/Digital Copy product. I've been buying blu-rays with digital copies for a while because they allow me to watch them on my iPad when I'm not at home. This is the first digital copy I've purchased that doesn't include an iTunes copy. I have no use or desire for yet another digital locker service, and no inclination to manage multiple separate incompatible libraries. I will probably return this product.

0670014893|4.0|'The Spy That Came In From The Cold', I remember the first page and then not much until I finished the book. This novel feels much the same. The first chapter confusing, trying to figure out who's who and what is what. Finally, realizing that as this story unfolds, it is brilliant. Paul, Jeb, Eliot, Giles, Toby, Crispin and Emily, all characters that come to life. Gibraltar, Cornwall, London, Beirut, the Caribbean, these are the places for the world of the Intelligence Service.<br /><br />Le Carr&eacute;'s novels have changed, his characters have come to life with humor and emotion. It is the 'little people' that are the heroes of this story. No more spies, it is the everyday Joe up against the big machine of arms and politics. Paul,aka Kit Probyn, is drawn into a mysterious game as a low level government worker. He settled down in the country with his wife and daughter to the good life. Now, he finds out this game was not without consequences, and he and Toby Bell, a diplomat are trying to find and report the truth. This is a masterful story that comes alive with suspense as new truths unfold and old truths are found misleading.<br /><br />There is a lot of political correctness gone awry in this novel. The issue of England and the US working together in clandestine versions of one cover-up after another. So, these two individuals come together to find the truth and to spread light upon dark waters. I do hope we are able to follow Toby Bell in his career. Truth and justice, will it prevail? Le Carre is at the top of his game once again. The Cold War has come and gone. The new era is upon us.<br /><br />Highly Recommended. prisrob 05-15-13
B00BUCW54Q|3.0|The story line of the film was smart and moved quickly. I just couldn't get into Jack Reacher being played by Tom Cruise though. I like Cruise in general, but Reacher is supposed to be 6'8\\" 250# hulk of a guy who takes no prisoners amoung the bad guys. Tom Cruise - not. Good story, bad casting.
B00CHI5B7A|3.0|LA in the time of Mickey Cohen, 1949. Cohen wants to take over LA and the entire West Coast. Chief Parker, the only cop in LA who seems to be straight wants to bring Cohen down. He brings on Sgt John O'Mara, played by Josh Brolin to head this secret squad. Sgt's wife played by Mirele Enos, (the US version of The Killing,star) helps him choose his squad. Ryan Gosling, is the most famous and difficult to get. Ryan is in love with Cohen's girlfriend, played by Emma Stone. That pretty much sums up the star power.<br /><br />A lot of star power in ths film. A lot of guns, callous and brutal murder, violence and blood, so much blood. There is a semblance of a story, but not much of one. As I said, the best part of the film is the stars.<br /><br />Not Recommended. prisrob 05-14-13
1400069742|1.0|The fight over the second world war in the US from 1939-1941 is an important neglected subject. For a very long time, there has been a need to get beyond the simple traditional narrative and give a more comprehensive view of events. This book is unfortunately a total failure. The author is attached to a particular \\"heroic\\" populist narrative of her own invention. The book is poorly researched, often reckless with facts and written in a really annoying style. There is almost too much to cover in terms of what the book gets wrong.<br /><br />The narrative is populist in the sense that she is attached to the idea that \\"the people\\" defeated isolationism and that \\"the people\\" were usually far ahead of leaders like FDR. She is attached to the idea that there was a pervasive pro-war view in the country before Pearl Harbor that only required strong leadership to activate. By being in the side of the people, the author is somewhat free to attack a wider range of people than would feature in the traditional narrative. In particular, it gives the author a springboard to be critical of FDR and his administration.<br /><br />Her ideas about FDR are often very strange. She is constantly sniping at him for apparently not having done enough by getting the draft, lend-lease and the repeal of the various neutrality acts through congress. She is utterly convinced that the American people overwhelmingly wanted to go to war with Germany and that lazy old FDR failed to do what the people wanted. On p. 289, she faults him for not taking over US industry and implementing rationing in the aftermath of the passage of lend lease. She does not seem to understand that the President lacked any legal or constitutional authority at that time to \\"compel\\" companies to produce certain products or to introduce rationing in peacetime. To her it's all down to presidential leadership (or as she describes it a lack thereof).<br /><br />She often engages in what is basically character assassination through quotation. A real gutter sort of historical technique. An example is p. 298. She uses one-sided quotations to attack Cordell Hull as a coward and a defeatist. Then she reaches down into the state department to indirectly tar Cordell Hull as someone representing Anglophobia and antiwar attitudes. The paragraph ends with FDR's wife being quoted as calling one state department official a \\"fascist\\". She moves on in the next paragraph to tar George Marshall as an isolationist. She uses a quotation of opinion from another historian to suggest that being in favor of Hemisphere defense and being in favor of American rearmament being co-equal priority with weapons transfers to the British is the same as being a supporter of the America First isolationists. The author should be ashamed of herself for these poison-pen attacks on individuals that are scattered throughout the book.<br /><br />The author is often hostile to those who offered honest assessments of military situation at the time. She frames Lindbergh's opinions on the german air force in terms of what those opinions did to discourage war in 1938 rather than what they accomplished in terms of waking up the united states to make a bigger investment in military aircraft which paid off in the long term. She complains about those who offered honest views of the British position in 1941 in terms of the disaster in the balkans. The author has a sort of historical tunnel vision where the only priority and only consideration is getting countries to enter the war as early as possible. Its a propagandists view of the situation.<br /><br />The book entirely neglects the other important strain of isolationism in America from 1939 to June 1941. That being the isolationism coming from the far left based on the alliance of the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany. At one point she mentions the months-long the 24 hour continuous peace vigils in front of the white house by the group American Peace Mobilization. But presents the organization as if it were another right-wing group. She neglects too much of anything about the political change that occurred in certain parts of the electorate in war views after the German invasion of the Soviet Union. For example, literally overnight the pro-\\"peace\\" American Peace Mobilziation transformed itself into the pro-war American People's Mobilization.<br /><br />But there are even more curious omissions. One of the most strange is that of Joseph P. Kennedy whose behavior in London and eventual forced resignation would seem a major part of any telling of the story of these years. She smears Cordell Hull and the state department indirectly with the word \\"fascist\\" but has not a word to say about a man whose public behavior went far beyond anything Hull did. The only mention of Kennedy is in the context of a meeting he had with Hollywood producers. There is also a rather curious downplaying of the American Irish anti-British component against aid to Britain. She only devotes part of one page to it. Then inexplicably says that Americans were hostile to Britain due to appeasement in 1938 and uses a quote to backhandedly call Chamberlain a \\"fascist\\".<br /><br />She covers the Smith Act in two pages. She offers a defense of the act in terms of it \\"establishing federal control\\" and ending local abuses of foreigners. She talks about the anti-sedition portions of the act only the abstract and talking about court decisions from a decade before. She has nothing to say about the consequences of the act, the \\"great sedition trial of 1944\\" where 42 people were rounded up or that the act continued in force until the 1960s. She does not explain how the act worked. That the government only had to show similiarity between the ideas of any person and a group (which the person did not have to be a member of) advocating the overthrow of the government to make that person guilty of advocating the overthrow of the government.<br /><br />She erases all of the anti-Nazi/anti-fascist investigations by the Dies committee from history. According to her, the entire history of the Dies committee can be summarized as attempt \\"to portray the New Deal as part of a vast communist conspiracy\\". She reaches back to events of 1938 to make points about what was happening in 1941. Rather than cover the actual history of the Dies committee, she talks about pre-1939 controversies over the Federal Theater Project and attempts to say that the Dies committee was just a pioneer of McCarthyism. She very selectively talks about communists losing their jobs because of \\"background checks\\" for membership in \\"subversive organizations\\". Why she omits talking about fascists also being removed is a good question.<br /><br />On p. 363, she makes the mistake of using a quote by Edward G. Robinson ridiculing the anti-political ideology of the film studios as if it were a statement in support of those views. She also makes ridiculously inaccurate statements about the politics of the film industry. The industry (as opposed to creative individuals) was not necessarily on the left, pro-FDR or pro-New Deal in the way she suggests. Louis B. Mayer (MGM) was a republican. She makes the bizarre claim that the HUAC investigations in the late 1940s were isolationist revenge. No support is offered in the way of facts. She claims those HUAC went after were simply involved in \\"Hollywood's prewar campaigns against the dictators\\". She further says that \\"anyone who ever marched against Hitler or Mussolini was at risk of losing his or her job.\\" after the war.<br /><br />She notes the bizarre film \\"Mission to Moscow\\" without doing much more than blaming the Roosevelt administration for it rather than anyone in Hollywood. Mission to Moscow is a rather infamous film which defends Stalin's purge trials and explains that Americans should encourage soviet spying because all the soviets will learn is how good the intentions of Americans are. While constantly attacking anti-spying activity by the US government and tying into events years after the war, she has nothing to say about the reality of widespread soviet spying against the US in those years.<br /><br />The book often has a tendency to be very naive about sources from the period. She often fails to understand that Newspapers were often political and that reading period newspapers is not necessarily a good way of understanding what public opinion was. On p. 409, she quotes Life Magazine as to public opinion on war with Japan. In doing so, she fails apparently to understand the politics of the Magazine and its owner in terms of the pacific war. She seems ignorant of the fact that Henry Luce had been born in China and was probably the foremost advocate of greater US intervention in Asia at that time. She often in the book presents dead certainties about public opinion in the era which are not things that anyone could be certain of. In her mind, the entire country had been educated on the need for war with Germany before Pearl Harbor and was convinced to go to war before the Japanese even attacked. That's a stunning conclusion and a stunning revision to history for which she offers scant proof.<br /><br />She is often full of almost irrational hate for certain individuals based mostly on their politics. \\"Hap Arnold\\" was an important military contributor to the American victory in the war. On p. 448, she attacks Arnold's success in building the Army Air Corps by associating him with the ideas that strategic bombing could win wars by itself and that airpower was superior to all other military force.<br /><br />Toward the end of the book, she dives into the personal life and marriage of Charles Lindbergh. The problem is that her eye of scornful judgement over his life is rather hypocritical. Similiar, if not worse, analysis could be done of the lives (and marriages) of (for example) Franklin Roosevelt or Willke for that matter but she does not offer it. She goes so far as to attribute to Lindbergh a sort of Germanic Aryan Nazi motives in his extramartial affairs without the slightest bit of proof. Lindbergh having extramartial affairs is \\"breathtaking in its audacity\\". Of course the careful reader will note that his wife had started her own affair outside the marriage before he began his \\"audacity\\". We are presented with every cliche in the book in order to justify her behavior. Her having liasons in her private New York Apartment is understandable while his are a \\"covert life\\". Worst of all, those things said of the Lindberghs and their marriage could also be said about the Roosevelts and theirs but the author chooses not to say them. As with many authors, its only her enemies that are subject to quack analysis of their personalities and motives.<br /><br />The book has about one page on the postwar legacy of internationalism. One would think that there would be more to say on the subject and the ultimate legacy of the internationists: The Vietnam War. She tries to draw a distinction between \\"good\\" 1940s internationalism and \\"bad\\" post-FDR internationalism combined with nationalism/imperialism. But it is far from convincing.<br /><br />On p.130, she offers up utter nonsense about the US military in 1940. She spins a fantasy about Germany with its tiny navy controlling the entire Atlantic after a potential fall of the British Isles and acts if the US did not have the naval power to fight in the Atlantic and Pacific at the same time. She spins pure fantasy of a German blockade of North America and Germans sending \\"troop ships\\" to South America. Now these are proper statements for the panic-struck world of 1940. But a historian in 2013 should be looking at statements like those with a questioning eye or at least framing them in a better way that she does.<br /><br />The flaws, biases and wrong-headed opinions of the book are so widespread that is difficult to where to begin or to end. I don't know what to call this book, but it's not really history in the ordinary sense. If the book had turned out to just be a one-sided history of isolationist movement, it might not have been so bad. But the author strays way out of bounds on numerous occasions which I have somewhat tried to cover by example above.<br /><br />Her views on FDR, his administration and many of the leading personalities of it are by far the worst part the book. A close second is the contradiction in her ideas between \\"those angry days\\" of political conflict and her ideas that almost the entire population were crying to be led to war *before* Pearl Harbor. I had high hopes for the book, but it was anything but what I expected.ent and tying into events years after the war, she has nothing to say about the reality of widespread soviet spying against the US in those years.<br /><br />The book often has a tendency to be very naive about sources from the period.

0307352145|5.0|This is a must read for everyone to modernize their belief of an introvert. As an introvert it was surprising to learn that one third of the population is introverted. However introverts of an older generation have been taught to hide their introversion from others since within the U.S. introversion isn't positively viewed, whereas extroversion is more positively treated. However with the advent of this book and the discussion that it brings along with it, the tables are turning on how introversion is received in our culture. The use of historical figures like Gandhi and Rosa Parks as introverts was nice because too. Introverts in this day and age have been taught to &#34;fake it until they make it&#34; however for them this means putting themselves outside of their comfort zone. This book goes to great lengths to distinguish introversion from shyness, because even though introverts can be shy there is the association with anti-social behavior with shyness that is not always there with introverts.We also learn that introversion isn't of pride within our culture and that it is in some Asian cultures. This book also leaves suggestions for how successful techniques of introversion can help to build up intelligence and productivity in certain work spaces like the office and schools. I am glad that as an introvert I never grew up with the idea that introversion was bad, because many stories in hear have grown up with the idea that introversion is bad and so such behavior should be lessened. Great read for anyone interested in introversion and extroversion.

B008JJM88Q|5.0|My son bought this for the Kindle, I think for a dollar. This is something that I thought would be a little hokey. Turned out that I was wrong! This is a fun tool to play with and to see if it can find out the person you are thinking about in the fewest questions possible. Initially, I used James Bond (12 or 13 questions). Then I began to try and think of people who would stump it. Marshall Crenshaw (look him up - great musician) stumped it. However, the next day, I tried it and Ernest Borgnine was in there! Best part is that the more use this gets, the greater completion of and more diverse the database becomes. Next time someone wants to use Marshall Crenshaw as their pick, it will probably get it!

B0040UEI7W|3.0|This recording was made in Dresden, years before the German reunification. Not a few people wondered how Karajan managed so easily to cross the barrier, when the politicians on both sides were hardly on speaking terms. The Staatskapelle was of course known as a quality orchestra and had been recorded or released by Western companies. But it wasn't until the iron curtain came down that their reputation went up to its present standing.<br />This Meistersinger recording has not been universally acclaimed, though this is hardly the orchestra's fault. More likely Karajan's, who had a liking for certain singers that seems in retrospect somewhat dubious. He told Kollo and Donath that they were just the pair of youthful lovers he had always envisioned for the parts - but I respectfully disagree, along with many connoisseurs of Wagner singing. Considering the political constellation of the time, Peter Schreier would have given us a far more adequate Stolzing than Kollo - the latter's voice still sounds too much like pop singer's smoky crooning; he has no ring at the top, and his vocal acting is downright amateurish. Helen Donath compensates for his deficiencies, at least vocally, and gives a believable of the maiden fallen head over heels for the young knight, who also enjoy a bit of coquettishness in her dialogue with Sachs.<br />Theo Adam's Sachs has good vocal assets, but I can't warm to his portrait. All the characterising elements seem to be missing - authority, fatherliness, wisdom. A good singer; no Hans Sachs.  Beckmesser is of course a figure of fun, rather disdainfully sketched by Wagner; but I find Geraint Evans' singsong and speech song a bit over the top. On the other hand Ruth Hesse, Peter Schreier (singing David), Karl Ridderbusch and the other minor parts are as well sung as they should. The Chorus, too, so important in this work, is right inside it.<br />The orchestral playing is a marvel, testimony that the Staatskapelle was as good then as now; and Karajanhimself heaped words of praise on them in his farewell address. (But he never went back to Dresden).<br />All told, a fine version. The quality of sound is not as good as the best produced by EMI in those days - there are hard edges to the upper voices in the orchestra which every now and then intrude unpleasantly. But the hardest feature to overlook the less than satisfactory quality of the principal singers. Being Karajan's sole studio recording of the work, one might have hoped for a more ripened Wagnerian cast - there was after all no lack of Meistersinger-quality singers at the time.<br />I think Sawallisch's recording is a better buy on all counts; and though the orchestral playing is not on the same exalted level, it is altogether satisfactory.
0385344228|5.0|I just finished reading this brilliant novel. If you enjoyed the novel, \\"Gone Girl\\", then I think you will enjoy this one. There is a similar plot in which one of the main characters is accused of murder. In addition, like \\"Gone Girl\\" there is an unreliable narrator who you are never really sure is being honest with not only the reader but also himself. The characters in the book also all have very distinctive voices. Many poorly written books have characters that all sound like the same person. However, in this novel, the 14-year-old sounds like a teenager and not a middle-aged male. The book also makes you contemplate what you would do and think and feel if you were in the same situation as this family. It makes you think of how far you would go to defend and believe in your child. It makes you wonder how blind parents can be to their own children. It makes you never want to have teenage children. Another aspect that makes this a great novel is that it opens your eyes about what really goes on in our society. In this one, you learn a lot about the justice or lack of justice system that a lot of writers don't acknowledge or they don't acknowledge with such frankness and cynicism.  Much of what he writes about I suspected for a long time, but our media and the TPTB never allude to. You will have to read to find out. I don't want to give too much away. Just read it!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Let me start by saying I love contemporary romance novels. When you find that one book for you, you cherish it. I have read hundreds of books and can honestly say this is one of my all time favorites. I fell in love with all of the characters especially Travis. He is the epitome of sex, with his bad boy attitude and his tattoos. Many books these days are about instant love and that's super annoying. This will contain spoilers.....<br /><br />Abby wasn't this weak college student. I totally grasped her fear when I  came to Travis. I love a strong female character.<br />Travis seriously knows how to make a girl squirm!!! I fell in love with him. Not only was he funny, but he was protective. I don't care what any girl says, one woman wants a protective man. He did everything he could to make Abby see how much he truly cared. He was swoon worthy. He is definitely my favorite book boyfriend:)<br /><br />Honestly Jamie McGuire is extremely talented. Her writing is always impeccably done. She has such a natural talent. Thank you for writing such an amazing book!

B006PTNQGU|3.0|Story line was slow, casting was good (except Lead kid had a hard time delivering his lines).  Children in support were great and the parents were great too!  Entertaining in kind of a slapstick way.
B000GL1BHO|5.0|Very impressed. Bought this for my 5 year old daughter who loves dinos.  This is highly detailed and looks very realistic, the jaw can be moved open and closed.  Very durable, but probaby for more mature kids who will take care of their toys.  It his definitely one of her favorites in her dino set.

Buy it and listen first to the music and then to the story.

0345529057|5.0|These books are so well-written and so immersive, I really felt like I was going to Westeros every time I picked one up. Beyond just my usual 'subway commute' reading, I read them everywhere, at whatever free moment I had. Even though I've seen the show and know what happens, I'd still gasp at parts, and feverishly turn pages to read more. They also help provide a more fleshed-out understanding of the show, which is incredibly complex and nuanced. I can't recommend these enough.

B00BGIC2J2|1.0|This is my first review ever. I feel compelled to do so as it is my honest assertion that this is the worst movie ever made. Moments of conflict, never balanced with the overwhelming positives of raising children (I have four) meld together to create a movie which makes you want to head out the door and crash into a bridge abutment. My wife, who loves movies, drifted off multiple times. I only remained to see if the movie would ultimately redeem itself. It did not. I now want to live less than I did before renting the movie. Multiple vulgar references to anatomy made date night feel like a script from a public toilet wall. Thanks to the director- perhaps his obsession with Viagra derives from his fantastic ability to de-romanticize the most intimate life issues. Keep my money- I want my time back
B006CHML4I|4.0|I have had the watch for about 2 weeks now. I have other watches that I wear depending on the occasion. My go to watch is a Citizen Quartz which has been running strong for 15 years and keeps time perfectly. I wanted something nice for casual summer dress, and did not plan on wearing it daily. This watch does not want to leave your wrist. The battery that stores a charge from your movement only keeps the watch working for about 24-36 hours after you remove the watch from your hand. If you wear a different watch for a few days and want to come back to this one, plan on putting it on, moving your wrist for 30 seconds, and then setting the time. As opposed to other reviews, I had no issue following the simple instructions to set the day, date, and time. If you have worn a watch with a date function before, you know how to set it on this watch. Anyone that is complaining about the difficulty at setting the day/date/time did not read the directions before use.<br /><br />Update: 8/14/2013<br />I was wrong about the time that the watch would continue working after removed from my wrist. It seems that less than  12 hours is more normal. If I remove the watch after I get home from work at 6pm and put it back on when leaving for work at 7am the next morning, the time is usually frozen between 5am and 6am. This mean that the watch is regularly continuing to run for only 11-12 hours after being removed from my wrist.

B005HJU7HA|4.0|My mother was a pretty wise woman. She knew that I was an inquisitive little boy and an avid reader for my age. So she introduced me to a little book called Selected Stories from the Adventures of Sherlock Holmes... And I have been absolutely hooked ever since. This particular book is important because it contains EVERY Sherlock Holmes adventure ever penned by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. It is any Holmes fan's wish come true! Every captivating case the fictional detective has ever tackled is here and just as memorable as ever. From the very first words of the Study in Scarlet, to the closing scene of the Final Problem, to the Return of Sherlock Holmes and everything in between - this is the ultimate Sherlock Holmes collection. A must-have for fans.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Considering the series has been going for 8 seasons, it has continued to grow and create new interests to keep viewers hooked. I love the characters.
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|I read the first Hunger Games book out of curiosity when I heard that the movie was coming out. Yes, I was a prisoner of the moment... sue me. Anyway, I found the first book to be absolutely incredible. I devoured it - page after page without stopping. I think I finished it in just a couple of days. Naturally, I was excited to read the other two books in the trilogy. Let me just begin by saying that the second book is easily the weakest in the trilogy. I don't want to be unfair, but the development of Katniss as a character kind of made me lose respect for her from the first novel to the second. She goes from hardcore tom-boy with an attitude problem in the first book, to being a whiney, blubbering, emotional teenage trainwreck in book two. Mockingjay redeems her a little bit, as she is forced to lay the smackdown on some fools and finally becomes the hero we've been waiting for. But it takes her a long and somewhat boring book (Catching Fire) to get her there. I bought this combined trilogy for the convenience of having all three books on my Kindle. If you haven't read them, go ahead and do it. There is enough good material between the first and third book to make up for the slow pace of the second book. You will have quite a few page-turning moments, and a ton of chapter endings that absolutely force you to turn to the first page of the next chapter just to see what happens. However, I will admit that the second book (and parts of the third) make this trilogy good... but not great.
B00BU18U82|4.0|Farming simulator is a great game, but android could've at least put 4 tractors to buy instead of two. PC version is better with TONS of equipment, but if you can't get the PC version, stick with this until you CAN get the PC version. It is also worth it to cough up the money to unlock the combine harvesters.

1938469011|3.0|Like many of the other reviewers/ brewers, I bought this because I really enjoyed the YEAST book by Brewing Elements Series.  I agree with one of the other reviewers that also gave it three stars, so I probably don't need to re-hash that review since it was well written.<br /><br />A few reasons why I couldn't pour over in the review:  My main complaint is that I also found the material to be lacking in practical brewing information (compared to the yeast book which has all kinds of hands-on yeast lab set-up and technique, yeast handling and storage on a nano and macro level, temperature and oxygenation test results and graphs, etc...).  The HOPS book is very well researched, but except for the clone recipes near the end of the book and the hop reference guide in the middle section, I just didn't find it useful in my day to day brewing.<br /><br />The first half of the book is basically the history of hops, who grew them,  and the genetic lineage of the different strains of hop plants (Cascade, Chinook, etc).  Personally, I thought that while the writing is conversational, it jumps around a lot.  It's hard to specify without referencing multiple paragraphs and pages, but after a while I felt like all I was reading was \\"Japan...1952...Germany....USDA.....1910......Illinois...... Oregon State... ...1988.....1985.....Chinook.....1966....Sierra Nevada. ....2004.......1955.....1970).<br /><br />You should already know that everyone tastes and smells and likes different beers/ hops for whatever reasons (environmental, genetic, conditioning, seasonal).  I feel like this book really just re-emphasises that nobody can really put their finger on (or at least come to a consensus on) what exactly certain hops smell like, how exactly to get any particular flavor into your beer, or why exactly it happens.  I feel like I kept reading (which I already know), that you just have to experiment with bases, hops, yeasts, timing of hop additions, and amounts to find the flavors you like.  I'm paraphrasing of course, and I'm well aware that this is what makes brewing such an wonderful and exciting art form.<br /><br /> I just expected a little more practical information from this book that I could immediately apply.  It's my fault that the history of the hops was less interesting to me.  Still, I'm glad I read it.I'm paraphrasing of course, and I'm well aware that this is what makes brewing such an wonderful and exciting art form.<br /><br /> I just expected a little more practical information from this book that I could immediately apply.

B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|Just starting the diet this week!  Did one fast day.  It isn't as difficult as I thought it might be.  I highly recommend it to anyone wanting to take control back in their life with the eating habits our society has acquired, and adapted as &#34;the norm&#34;!
B004DSX5B6|5.0|I brought this for my son. he is very happy with it. Now after i brought my leatherman from Amazon, he wants one now
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Very fun. I like the game. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is because it kicks me out quite a bit and it usually takes around 4 or 5 tries to actually get into the game.

IF THEY DO COME OUT WITH MORE LEVELS THE PEOPLE WHO BOUGHT THIS GAME SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY FOR THE NEW LEVELS. SO IF THE MAKERS OF THIS GAME READS THIS KEEP THAT IN MIND WHEN U DO COME OUT WITH MORE LEVELS!!!!!!!!!!

B00CKOYVG8|1.0|It's not that fun. Make angry birds better. They should have a bird that wipes out the whole level but not like the eagle.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|I downloaded this, thinking it might be good for my preschooler.  It's a bit advanced for him to understand, but he likes clicking to collect things, and visiting other people's reefs.  I, myself, got a bit hooked the first few days, but the novelty quickly wears off.  Great graphics, soothing music, and a fun way to pass some time.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|I guess I'm a little behind the times with this one - but I'm sure glad I started watching. I watched Season 1 by myself because my wife wasn't interested in watching &#34;another crime show&#34;. I finally got her to watch the first two episodes of season 2, and at the end of the show last night she says &#34;Let's watch the next one!&#34;

B00AIQP9DE|5.0|The game is great and takes time to get thru witch I love I hope u make more that takes more then a few hours to finish.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|No deep analysis -- I like this too-short series about as much as possible without putting on costumes and going to conventions.  The concept was too audacious for the reality TV audience, apparently, and the network Reavers, certainly, but the writing and casting were top-notch.<br /><br />For those who've seen this, I'm preaching to the choir.  For those who haven't seen this, Firefly plays like a highly entertaining mashup of various classic Howard Hawks movies -- set in space.<br /><br />Wash: \\"That sounds like something out of science-fiction.\\"<br /><br />Zoë: \\"We live in a spaceship, dear.\\"
0812993357|3.0|I found this memoir lacking in that the author chose to omit experiences and events that led to her eventual position as a Vogue editor.  As with most autobiographies, the author glosses over the things they would rather forget but what readers want to know.
B000GL1BHO|5.0|This pteranodon is not only fun for kids, but makes it easy to explain the connection between the birds of today and this prehistoric ancestor. He is substantial and balanced so that he stands up to play. I would recommend these models to anyone who is looking for toys that engage a child's imagination and interest while representing prehistoric creatures realistically. These models are so durable they could easily outlast your child's childhood.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|I love this CD.  The music is wonderful throughout.  You will relax and enjoy.  Don't hesitate to buy this one!!
B000GKW4HG|5.0|These dinosaur models are heavy duty and very realistic. The sheer weight of them is satisfying in the hand and they stay upright during rough and tumble play. I bought them for my grandson's 3rd birthday and he and his older neighborhood friends love them. They lend themselves to imaginative and energetic play. I would recommend them to anyone who is looking for toys that will delight and endure throughout childhood.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I had quit reading King years ago because his books were so formulaic and predictable.  The story line of this one was so unique I decided to give it a try and absolutely loved it. I've recommended it several friends and my husband just finished it and also loved it.  It's a very thought provoking book.

0374533571|5.0|I bought this book because I heard really good things about the movie, and I personally prefer to read a book before I see the movie. The book did live up to its potential, the writing was superb and the characters were well developed. Awesome read.
B00CHSPB8Y|2.0|my kids liked it but it was hard to upgrade unless you paid real money,  levels were hard to beat, also game made the kindle fire freeze. un-<br />installed game!!!
B0088W7VNG|5.0|Not quite par with the original Stargate SG-1 in my book but this was a good spinoff series that carried its own weight and did well with the stories.  I thought it ended the series nicely too.  Some last episodes can try too hard but this one did a decent job.  Overall I enjoyed the series and the characters were strong and people you cared to know.  I will say they were a little annoying killing off some lead characters but other than that good.
B00BF11STU|5.0|Great.  So much better than others out. Realistic and shows the true reality. One of the best out there to me.
B009VB97EY|2.0|I am so glad I did not pay theater prices to see this and can not believe they are making a second one. Story line is too weak that even the dancing can not save it
B0056BMK6K|5.0|I really enjoyed this informative read. I have published an Ebook, Hoodwinked by Brandon Thompson. I feel John's writing style is similar to mine, but what I've been missing is the business side of self publishing. I am writing a few more books and will be putting his principles into practice!
B008Y1RTUG|5.0|I loved it.............. I will watch this one over and over again, love the effects and the dark spin on a classic tale
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Everyone speaks about the sex in these trilogy but what really lies in these books is a real love story of two finding helping each other to find themselves. Amazing love story and a must read for all. The sex part of it should only help whatever relationship you are in.
B002VECM6S|5.0|This is an excellent family movie.  Have watcher it numerous times.  We have let friends and family borrow it on<br />occasion.  Sandra Bullock s one of my favorites .  I was not aware that Tim McGraw was an actor and do enjoy his music.<br />Very pleased with he movie.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Really great game, kind of challenging in the dark. Love games that you find items. Don't like the fact that when you run out of diamonds to it's hard to get more.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I like this game. It is challenging enough. It is fun and I like the graphics. It does take a little getting used to.
B00COMLLX2|5.0|Wow, what an impressive group of tables! They all play smoothly on my Kindle. While the licensed Marvel and Star Wars tables got my early attention, l' m finding the original tables a bit more satisfying. On some of the Marvel tables the characters and some of their toys become too distracting. I hope more original tables are on their way to the Kindle Fire soon.
193700788X|5.0|Spoiler Alert ! I think Charlaine Harris has done an excellent job of wrapping the series up in this final book. I just don't get all these fans that are upset because Sookie ends up with Sam instead of Eric. I mean, come on...Eric is the type that you have an affair, not the sort that you settle down with and grow old together (well, Sookie would grow old while Eric stayed young).
0811879542|3.0|I think it's a clever idea and the kids will get a kick out of it but, it's probably for a very small age group, 3-6years.

B00266W04K|4.0|The plot was a bit watery.  I enjoyed the message to live life to the fullest and to put yourself out there.  It really does work.
B0062YADWI|3.0|I loved the idea of the bottle opener and opular hex wrench on a carabiner but it's functionality is questionable. Seems that if the two tools were switched around or the carabiner opened on the other end, it would be much easier to use he carabiner.  The flat end of the carabiner causes it to snag when trying to remove the carabiner.  I like the size and slim design of the carabiner and look forward to its next version.
B00BCOQSSQ|5.0|Everville is what I would consider a great read! Not only was Roy Huff's story well-written, but the chemistry between characters is superbly done, along with the compelling convergence of realities makes an enjoyable adventure. I will look forward to reading more of his novels.
B00BTYP6QE|2.0|Would be three stars, but in-app purchases drops to two.  The original was great.  By now a bit boring.  Too bad.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I live on a highway that has a lot of traffic. This app works very well for me because it blocks out the noise so I can sleep. The fact that you can add more than one sound is very helpful and the fact that it will play all night helps as well.
B002PJ4I3Y|5.0|This short book tells the story of Easy Company as they are formed, trained, and shipped off to war.  Ambrose does a great job of telling the readers about the Soldiers and Leaders of this famed organization.  Band of Brothers doesn't read like a history book.  Like many other of Ambrose's books, it reads more like a novel.<br /><br />There is much to be learned from this book: about life, leadership, soldiering, and combat.  An organization I was part of used this book and the HBO mini-series for a two-month-long leadership study.  The book adds important insights into the individuals that you can't get from watching the mini-series alone.
B00CFOXBX2|4.0|Good story development, and great acting. Deals with a contemporary subject matter with an interesting twist,  Good big bowl of popcorn movie.
B009DH37CY|5.0|I saw this in the movie theatre when it was released and loved it.  I knew the minute it came to dvd it would be mine!  amazing how the crowd responded to that group and stunning how how mr. mercury could sway that crowd and keep them responding to him.  his voice was probably one of the finest in rock history!  Amazing how people hiked all over Europe just to see this group and I am sure they were all quite pleased with the concert.
B00C391Y3I|5.0|Looking at the playlist the songs and the concert were probably awesome. Envy I Feel. But wondering why the band Judas Priest who made great albums in Jugulator and Demolition would leave out songs. I think Rob could spruce up the vocals on such songs such as Hell is Home or Subterfuge or even Blood Stained. The dvd is still great but I wish they would consider some of the other two albums that Rob wasn't on.
B00CHSPB8Y|2.0|son got this game but he and I really do not like it at all.  Reaction time with the game is slow.
B009NY43NY|3.0|The book was ok, the ending...ok.  Not what I expect in a Charlaine Harris book. I expected great and was disappointed with adequate.  For a last book in the series I expected greatness. Something to make me feel it should end.  The last 25% was quick and to the point in a way that left u wondering if it was worth it, like the quick interlude with Sam and Sookie.  It probably needed two or three books to bring the different elements to completion and it seems Charlaine didn't have the time. Oh well, it won't end up as a favorite series.

B007I1Q4W2|2.0|I didn't care for this Civil War era  Zombie flick.  The zombies were pretty good but the storyline was ridiculous.  Zombies don't seem to translate well in the south.  It worked well in Abe Lincoln vs the zombies but by no means in this case.  There were animated sketches throughout the film which didn't seem to serve any purpose.  This isn't something  I'll probably watch again.  Add another one to my  really bad zombie collection.  You can't always depend on the customer reviews when making a purchase.  It's all personality driven.  You know what they say about opinions!

1936719118|3.0|\\"Anything you want\\" is a very short book. Page-wise, it's about 70 pages, but the pages are very small and the spacing is large, which means you ought to be able to read it in an hour or a few. It is an autobiographical book of Derek Sivers and his starting, growing and eventually selling his company: CD Baby... and the lessons he has learned in all of this.<br /><br />CD Baby was started by Derek Sivers in 1997 as a web-page for selling his own CD online. Friends started asking if they could sell their CD too and suddenly Derek had a company selling independent music on the internet. His company grew far beyond what he wanted or expected. During the startup and growth of the company he did set some important company values such as putting the customer and musicians often above the company itself. This in itself isn't exceptional, but Derek backs it up with interesting and funny stories on how he has been able to continuously surprise his customer.<br /><br />During his journey with CD Baby, he learned himself about what he wanted and didn't wanted and learned that he just wanted to focus on the things for himself. After the company grew to a certain size, he had enough of it as he felt he wouldn't achieve anything anymore that he wanted to achieve. He sold his company and moved on to enjoy his life.<br /><br />The book is well written, quite funny at times, insightful and very short. I've enjoyed reading the story of Derek and CD Baby and would recommend it to people as an interesting and funny story about starting companies. Yet, there wasn't any moment that was shocking or where I was very surprised. Compared to traditional companies, yet, CD Baby and what Derek did was definitively different. Derek does not follow the same greedy-make-lots-of-money attitude that you sometimes read in business books... and that was good. Yet it wasn't too extreme. All in all, I enjoyed reading the book, recommend it and perhaps might go and grab a beer with Derek (as he lives in the same city as me, it seems)the same city as me, it seems)

B00005V0X5|5.0|One thing about Megadeth is they hold nothing back.  When Metallica released their first album, Kill 'Em All, they utilized Dave Mustaine's music and lyrics; Most notably The Four Horsemen/Mechanix.  Mustaine claims to have prohibited the use of his work on any Metallica album.  This album proved the Megadeth wasn't playing around.  With faster and more complex guitar work, Killing Is My Business... And Business Is Good!'s only downside is the mastering.  At the time, Combat records was just growing and had little funding to master the album properly.  Since leaving Combat, Megadeth's albums have improved in quality.  This remaster's only weakness is the cover of These Boots, which has been edited by way of bleeping out &#34;'vile and offensive&#34; lyrics.  People complain about it, but it was included on the remastered album as a jab at  Lee Hazelwood, the song's original writer.  Funny, though;  For more than a decade he accepted the royalties and said nothing.<br /><br />I highly recommend this album, whether you have the original or not.  These Boots is nothing special anyway, I omit it from the playlists anyway.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|This makes me want to see more, I hope a sequel is in the works! It drew me in right away, a movie We will watch again and again.
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|This is, no doubt, an important movie.  The acting is good, the basic story uplifting.  One can not help wondering what a director from another continent would have done with it.  The actors have the potential to create scenes with more depth and accuracy about the human condition.  Most directors have to worry about the audience and this director offered something that many audiences could tolerate and understand.  I wish more viewers in the U.S. went to the movies for revelations beyond the obvious.  The humor of the situations and characters is uplifting and eases us in ways we understand/  Why not allow the difficulties of the story more weight?
B009AMANH4|4.0|I loved watching this movie, I wish it had been given more awards. It was a little slow in a spot or two, but worth the $$.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I have been a huge fan of Charlaine Harris' Sookie Stackhouse series. Every year, I was counting the days for the next book to come out, to see how my favorite characters continue their saga. The second I was done reading the book, I went into withdrawal, craving more. One of the reasons I loved these books so much was because of the character development. Harris did a great job in evolving each character in a way that it was credible and enjoyable. That's also why I stopped watching True Blood after season 4, because I felt Allan Ball completely butchered Bill's and Eric's characters with inconsistent and lame scripts. Unfortunately, the True Blood lameness seems to have rubbed off on Harris. The last two books were already starting to show fatigue. The characters became flat and stuck, the story line became predictable, and it looked to me like Harris should have written the last book earlier. However, I still had big hopes for the last book. Considering the depth of Sookie's and Eric's characters, this series really could have gone out with a bang. Instead, it slowly seeped into a pit of sludge.<br /><br />Nothing of what happens makes sense. Eric becomes a boring sideline with no backbone or drive. The Viking vampire who in the previous books dominated and controlled everything became a puppet in the games of vampires. The main story line brings back old characters that were boring to begin with and should have never made a reemergence. And the final conclusion was almost painful. I'm not trying to give away too much here. I bought the book and read it before I read any of the reviews because I figured there were spoilers. But after reading the book and wasting $13 on it, I almost wish I had read them before and trusted them. I feel so unsatisfied after reading this final installment that I'm actually considering writing my own last book to the Sookie and Eric saga, just so I can get some closure.<br /><br />I fear that Ms. Harris got corrupted by HBO and has maybe started to confuse the TV following with the people who actually buy and read her books. Just because Allen Ball decides Bill is his favorite character, and just because Ball wasn't able to recreate even 1% of the magic of book 4 in his season 4 doesn't mean that Harris needed to adjust to the flat story lines and follow Ball in the assassination of Eric's character. And to see that there is another book scheduled to be published to keep us updated on how the rest of the Sookie world fared after the last book? Come on....after such an incredibly lame, boring and nonsensical ending and monumental letdown, who in their right mind would ever buy a book again from Ms. Harris, especially about Bon Temp and Sookie? I know I won't.
B002SGYPS2|5.0|Good like the first time we watched it.  If you've ever wondered about your life then here it is.  good to watch
B002WV5A9G|5.0|As an avid &#34;Trekkie&#34; since the original Kirk and Spock, I initially was hesitant to see this movie....I figured it might tarnish my memories of the series.  How wrong I was!  An incredible flick!  Can't wait for the next one to be released this week!
0671510991|5.0|Investing time in reading this book, sooner versus later, offers a high return for anyone whose activities require an understanding of global affairs.  What may seem like news in the paper, or confusing, often becomes semi-predictable after reading this book.  While Dr. Kissinger served as Secretary of State 40 years ago, he knew what he was doing when he got there.<br /><br />Timeless:  Certain core principals govern the relationships between nations, regions and political actors.  Though President Wilson \\"changed the paradigm\\" in evolving foreign policy toward peace and mutual interests the concepts of balance of power apply.  When ignored, it doesn't work.<br /><br />Deeper Understanding:  Reading about a \\"current spat\\" in the Financial Times has little insight unless you understand the interests, historical backdrop, and motivations of the key players - and why.  What also becomes apparent is just how fragile the range of outcomes can be, and how the difference between effective and ineffective foreign policy can rest on the abilities and, more importantly, the weaknesses of just a few people, not to mention their relationships with each other.<br /><br />Long View:  The \\"success rate\\" in foreign relations is, in MY words, no better than the average stock picker and miscalculations have often produced grave consequences and missed opportunities.  While it is easy to say \\"of course\\" - he provides assessments of many historical figures and how their actions, whether successful or unsuccessful at the time, had long-term implications.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|What a wonderful show - how refreshing to see you don't need violence to have a rivoting drama.<br /><br />My husband (the macho blood and guts type) protested when I asked him to watch with me - after the first show, he started suggesting we watch another episode every evening and now he's eagerly awaiting next season with me.
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|Thanks! This was a great movie and I cant wait to see the next installment. Not recommended for younger kiddos not even if they can read the book. Thirteen and over.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|This review refers to the \\"Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, Blu ray 3D/2D/DVD combo pack\\" and no other edition. Readers please take note of this.<br /><br />UPDATE October 2013:<br />The extended version of the Hobbit has a running time of 182 min, whereas the theatrical cut is 169 min. So, the extended version has ONLY 13 EXTRA MINUTES OF ADDED FOOTAGE (As I mentioned previously in my review: The additions are not expected to be as huge as those of LOTR).<br /><br />It was a pleasure to return to Peter Jackson's middle earth after nearly a decade (The last time it was LOTR). Hobbit is hugely entertaining, exceptionally well done movie that has been created by carefully handling the original subject. Here is what you get in this product, what is this movie about, and a little food for thought if anyone wants to wait for \\"extended version\\" of the movie, which is supposed to be released sometimes at the end of this year.<br /><br />1. THE PRODUCT:<br />Hobbit blu ray dazzles by all means. The picture ans sound quality is reference grade, and the details are exceptional. This set has both 3D and 2D versions of the movie, a special feature (Blu ray, High Def), DVD and the ultraviolet digital copy. Hence, this gives you an options of watching the movie in all possible formats. The 3D quality is superb, with exceptional depth and clarity. Having owned many 3D blu rays, I would rank this among top 10 blu rays out there.<br /><br />2. THE MOVIE:<br />Hobbit is a prequel to the Lord of the Rings trilogy and is based upon the children's book by JRR Tolkien of the same name. Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is the first installment of the trilogy, and the next two movies are as follows:<br />Movie 2: Hobbit: The desolation of the Smaug (scheduled for Dec 2013)<br />Movie 3: Hobbit: There and back again (Scheduled for Dec 2014)<br />The book is classic, there is no doubt about it. However Peter Jackson did an exceptional work in bringing Tolkien's creation to the celluloid. His passion about the subject is known to the world, and equally admired. Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is no exception. Though there will be debates whether the movie was completely true to the book or not, I personally feel that making a TRILOGY over ONE childrens book is no joke, and only Peter Jackson's vision would have made this possible.<br />The movie appeared slow to many, which I can understand, because Hobbit, in general, has little less material than the LOTR. However, I felt it was about the right length, as I like to stay in Jackson's middle earth for little longer. Most importantly, the movie doesn't get bore at any time, and has the exceptional art of storytelling (IMO, You do not rush when you tell a story. The most important part is to keep the audience engaged, and this movie does it brilliantly). Hence, if you loved LOTR, Hobbit is a must buy, as this gives you the opportunity to visit the middle earth one more time.<br /><br />3. EXTENDED EDITION: Should you wait (and if yes, then how long, and that too, for mere extra 13 minutes)<br />There are announcements being made about the extended version of this movie being launched in Dec 2013. With the LOTR history, I wouldn't be surprised about it. However, before you completely ignore this 3D edition, there are few things I would like to point out:<br />a. Even if extended version gets out, I doubt it will be in 3D. Looks like 2D would be the only option.<br />b. Only a true fan of the movie would wait for the extended version, right? In that case, think: there are TWO more movies yet to come, so, your wait is not going to be \\"over\\" by Dec 2013. There will be two more 'theatrical' hobbits (and let's assume even they will have extended counterparts). I understand I am going too far, but I said only because even I have those movies in my wish list already! Hence, even I am thinking of making a 'wise buy\\" than double dip. So, think a little ahead before you make any decision.<br />c. As of today, what I hear is even if the extended edition is out, it will have 25-30 min of extra footage (Not huge addition like LOTR). I don't doubt that those additions will be great, but they don't seem to be as huge as they were for LOTR.<br />d. Even with 'theatrical' vs 'exdended' movies, I don't think they will be sold together. Most likely it will follow the LOTR saga (Remember, you still don't have Theatrical and Extended LOTR on one Blu ray/Blu ray set due to space limits).<br /><br />Summary:<br />If you like to see Hobbit in 3D, go for this edition. I really doubt the extended version (if it's out and whenever it's out) will get a 3D blu ray release. You will have plenty of 2D (regular ) blu ray editions to come in future (by making all permutations and combinations), but I have not seen 3D versions of the trilogies being sold seperately. With the exceptional lengths of these movies, I doubt there will be an \\"all in one\\" pack. Make a wise choice considering your personal preferences.
B001N4RORE|5.0|For some reason i still can't understand, Mamma Mia called to me the moment i saw the preview back in 2006 was it? 2008? Anyway, I didn't even know it was a musical, hard to believe. This movie is so great, it's a good time, it's funny, it's good forthe family [although my mom didnt particularly like the whole &#34;sophie doesn't know which teh 3 men is her dad ordeal&#34;] . the music is extremely catchy, this movie movie wil have you coming back for more.
B005CRQ4XI|3.0|Interesting book. I wasn't particularly interested in how horny she was. I was also miffed at how she couldn't learn that she could have solved her &#34;monster&#34; pack problem.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|I love the movie RENT, I bought this DVD because I hated always having to wait for it to come on Tv, it was rare. This 2 disc edition comes with almost 2-3 hours of extra stuff, from deleted scenes and musical numebrs to a short documentary. You really learn a lot about this film, the musical and what went into its creation. if you love RENT you definitely want to have this.
B0042FZWC0|1.0|Don't waste your time or money on this book. This author equates reading a bunch of books (random books) and traveling to a few countries and making a micro loan through Kiva then visiting the borrower to a formal college education.<br />He says it is a cheaper version. Preposterous. What makes formal education special and highly sought after beyond the credential is the multi-faceted experience of academics, socialization, broadening from diverse peer group interactions, and maturity through events/conversations offered.<br />You will not get the same rich experience from being your own travel agent and setting your own rules and expectations - where does your feedback come from? Where is your cohort to learn from and with? It's just you. Grad education isn't about the grades - it's about the skills you gain interacting with other people and learning from their experiences. Joining toastmasters as he suggests, doesn't cut it. It's insulting to sell this advice and irresponsible to give it.<br /><br />If you are directing your own education, as the author suggests, you're just entertaining yourself. If that's your goal, you'll be succeed. It's not the same as learning from experts and talented peers.
B004TLDZ3U|5.0|This is a fantastic intro for new Opeth fans.  If you like any of their late work (minus Heritage) then this will be one of your favorites.

B009JBZH54|5.0|just a great set of movies for a very affordable price. I wish more trilogies came like this one did. Bravo
159514188X|5.0|I had previously read reviews about this book, saying you won't be able to put it down, it'll shock your senses, make you think, make you want to be a better person, etc... I just HAD to read this novel. It did NOT disappoint. I sat down after work and in one afternoon read it cover to cover. It was intiruiging, thrilling, saddening, and tragically heart warming and beautiful all at once. I put the book down and just stared into space trying to sort through the emotions that were overflowing from a fictional book. It was one of the best, if not the absolute best, book I've ever read.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|This is one of the best things I've found for continuous use on my Kindle.  I have 7 puppies and they aren't easy to find in the dark.  This is better than a flashlight anyday!  THANKS!
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|I normally do not care for this author's books so I was surprised when I actually enjoyed this movie based on one of his novels.  Julianne Hough was very good in her role.<br /><br />My husband actually selected this movie for our movie night.  He knows that I don't care for Sparks' books but now that I have seen &#34;Safe Haven&#34; I can say that I'm glad my husband picked it.  I might add that he enjoyed the movie also.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|This book is great brain candy. If you enjoy Tina Fey's comedy writings on SNL & 30 Rock, you'll enjoy this. It reads as if she is sitting on the couch with you, telling a story. I enjoyed getting to know her. :) And as always I appreciate her sense of humor.
B007MB5OCE|2.0|I read half the book and just couldn't get through it<br />another unbelievable and not enjoyable read....not<br />on my favorite list
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|First Class album, if you watch the series you'll love it, already pre ordered Volume 2.<br />Will be ordering the DVD too
B000HWZ4CA|4.0|No problem love the ability to get old movies at decent price you took the stress out of ordering movies
B004JMZPJG|5.0|Just the right size to hold SLR with 18-200 lens and extra pockets for few items you need.  Love it.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I would recommend for all ages! Especially for younger children. My 5 year old loves it. As does my 3 year old.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|It was a good movie. I wasn't sure about the quality. I didn't know if it was supposed to be grainy since it was a period piece.
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|A suggestion: If you're the least unsure about this film, consider watching some or all of the extras BEFORE the movie. The trailers don't (can't, really) do the film justice, and the movie itself takes a bit of time to become compelling (or so I found). The well-constructed extras, however, quickly display the stunning and often unique aspects of this epic project -- actors playing 5 or 6 roles, sometimes changing race or gender (amazingly well done), six storylines interwoven with real artistry, gorgeously detailed period pieces (1800s to the twenty-second century, and then to a later post-apocalyptic time), the emphasis on love, freedom, and human growth -- and quite a bit more. Long before the film was over, this had become a new favorite movie. The Wachowskis have actually outdone their Matrix trilogy, at least for me.
B00BAB6CNC|4.0|It's still Stone Sour and I never have much bad to say about Corey Taylor. I prefer part 1 but am not disappointed in Part 2.
1936891026|2.0|This book is a fraud<br />  -- insert page break<br />It has one main idea<br />  -- insert page break<br />Writing is hard<br />  -- insert page break<br />Many factors will conspire to get you to abandon your dream<br />  -- insert page break<br /><br />That's a fair summary of both the content and style of the book.  Many many pages have but a single sentence or two on them.  This would have been a fine ninety-nine cent Kindle single.  I can't believe it sells for ten dollars.<br /><br />The whole book could have been summarized by the one (quite powerful) sentence early on:<br />\\"Writing isn't hard.  Sitting down to write is hard\\".
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I'm a guy and that was a great book. Sex aside it was very well written.  The story line kept the pages turning
B009AMAK54|5.0|Received the excellent movie quickly and in good condition.  I am not much of a baseball fan but this movie is about more than just that.
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|it kept on freezing up and it wont let me get in i dont want to ever see it on the appstore
B00AEFYX4U|5.0|I saw this movie in the theatre and wasn't sure what I thought of it.  Then I stopped trying to think of it as a animated movie for kids, and as one for adults with adult themes and the whole thing clicked.  Watching it on Blu-Ray later on just cemented that impression.<br /><br />Rango is a lizard who begins life in his tiny world and sees himself as an actor, as the hero-protagonist playing off against his non-living (mostly plastic) friends.  He suddenly realizes that he needs that sudden change to happen, the action which will propel the \\"hero\\" into action.  Of course, it then happens...and he is suddenly left by the side of the road in the desert.  A much much larger and more dangerous world.  At first, he is lost, but then he finds his stride by re-inventing himself as the hero he always thought he was, even though, deep down, he struggles with the realization that it is just a sham.  Just more play-acting.<br /><br />Yet the town of Dirt (filled with all sorts of desert creatures, dressed and based off a wide array of old Westerns--you will recognize quite a few of the characters) needs a real hero because their source of life and income, the water, has mysteriously dried up.  They place their hopes and dreams into Rango, who responds as best he can.  Yet, he must actually confront the truths about himself before he can be all that they need him to be.<br /><br />This is movie about a spiritual journey.  Not only does Rango seek to discover his true self, but he also learns how to care about others along the way.  He passes through death at one point to the magical and mysterious world on \\"the other side,\\" and there realizes why he exists.  He steps into the role that Fate intended for him, a fulfillment of the mystical hero who embodies the Spirit of the West.<br /><br />You will recognize loads of voices, and mannerisms, in this movie and shades of scenes from any good Western.  It has its funny moments, but overall this is a serious movie.  It reminded meof the \\"hero quest\\" that Joseph Campbell talked about in his lectures and books.  By the end of the movie, Rango has definitely found his \\"bliss.\\"<br /><br />Highly recommended.  Just don't go into this thinking, like I did from the ads, that this was a kid's movie.  Each time I watch the movie, I get more out of it and it makes me think about how I can be the protagonist of my own life.  Rango is definitely worth watching, especially if you enjoy Westerns and, even if you don't, for the life lessons it can teach.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Inspiring book with regards to near death experiences.  Dr. Alexander's account of his nde is Inspiring, and a great testimony to GODS unconditional  and perfect love and presents.

B007SGM084|5.0|Enjoyed the book. Can't wait for another FIFTY SHADES and I hope the movie. I liked  the times when they were playful, but not always in the playroom.
B00BRUYNBE|5.0|Since most of WOTE's previous albums were more cover songs from other artists (which has proven to be very successful for them), it was nice to be able to purchase an album from them that was overall more original than their previous attempts.  The variety of instruments, vocal tones, and musical beats blend for a solid record and has the ability to reach out to an even larger audience. This is truly a great effort from WOTE to have more of an \\"original\\" track list and to be their own band.  A band that shows their creativity in each song and can be wildly energetic and addicting to listen to.
0553801473|5.0|We are avid fans of the Game of Thrones show so of course had to have the books. We could't find the book in stores however Amazon had it. The book was delivered in two days in mint condition. It was so interesting my husband read this book day and night.
B005OT2YVA|1.0|Mind-numbingly repetitive, plodding, squandered story line, too long, even the special effects weren't effectively utilized.  I hope this is a lumbering, wheezing end to the franchise.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|The best in the series, undescribible. I love the series but this epic, strong, enjoyable game is the best yet<br />Looking for action? This is for you.<br />Looking to play with raypot? This is for you!<br />Enjoy
B00957T6X6|5.0|This has cost me more sleep.  Kind of a slow start, but the character development is excellent, really draws you in to the unfolding story. I respect that the author is willing to kill or main the characters as the plot demands, major characters are not sacred. Definitely keeps you interested and engaged.  This review really applies to the first three books in the series, just starting on the fourth book now.
0765325950|5.0|When i first read a Wheel of Time book, I actually started with The Great Hunt, because our library didn't have The Eye of the World. I fell in love with the series, and went out to purchase The Eye of the World. I now own the entire series, and they will always have a special place on my bookshelf. Great series, great ending to it. I only wish Mr. Jordan had lived to reach it with us.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This backpack is great.  It's light, but feels like it will survive a bit of wear.  The main interior pocket has several spots for lenses, and a spot for the camera body at the top.  There are two Velcro straps you can use to hold things in place that you can move to any of the compartments.  There are also two smaller zippered pockets on the outside that fit keys and other things, as well as two small Velcro-closing pockets on each side which perfectly fit my DSLR charger.<br /><br />One of the coolest and most handy features is the inclusion of two clasping straps that are along the right side of the backpack.  I use them to attach my tripod in its bag.  It works well with my light tripod and is more convenient than strapping that on as well.<br /><br />Don't expect to carry much besides camera equipment in here, but you should be able to take one DSLR, a bunch of lenses, a tripod, batter charger, and other small accessories...which is pretty much the point here, right?

B00AF6MF9I|3.0|It's another &quot;Free TO Game that  more a Three&quot;<br /><br />I like GL games.  I do. Ive played this game  nearly everyday for over two months. It's addicting. I want to build  that darn empire bigger than the ants around me. I'm finally ready to review and delete it. Like GameLoft  games, an  bugged on m  way to mny times..?. It's online, sure, by  the online (attacking other players and  forming alliances - what alliances? - only works half the time) standard  fun. If my alliance could conquer the few players playing this, sure.<br /><br />To me  it felt like GL on the Yukon trail. Fun for a day, but what's the point if all you do is  build, SIM, build. Oh, they throw  in fights .... GL , Im still good  but the mess of problems experienced  with this  game has  told me, after two months, get rid o  her, she ain't no good. Fun to build, design, but the gameplay is rock/paper/scissors an  there are NO actual alliances. You just fight random people for glory points.<br /><br />- Silister
B000HSKUBE|5.0|Loved the show. Wish it was longer and had a less abrupt end. Best dialogue, &#34;You might say that Maddie, I possibly couldn't comment.&#34;
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Gave it  three  it  free! Now try to spend the rest of your life earning what isn't free. To me, I wanted to play this bad. Fours and it's a bore ... I respect GL for having to make money, and they make good games. To me, I would have spent ten bucks buying this game with possible, not impossible gameplay, to earn my just suits deserved. It's.  Time-consuming, fun game, but when I tally up the best possible things as hundreds upon hundreds upon hundred ... hrs gameplay versus a 60+dollar iron man game  that will inevitably be out  soon .... I'm gonna take  that 60 dollar game versus spending 100+ dollars buying suits for a game challenging enough that I like  but too impossible for kids. It's fun, but when I earned  my new iron man suit by gaining experience, then ha  to re-earn it through coins I collected ... I said  &quot;off my kindle you go!&quot; Interesting game, but I've got ADD and stuff. I want to play the game  not by a developer.<br /><br />My review is only do  this  who have played it. Try it  you might like it. Controls are decent. Graphics are kick-butt! Reputation o  no  being able  to buy shiny suits for 4  - 6 hours after first gameplay wrecks me.
0399103422|4.0|An interesting fictional account of the inner workings of the mafia. It seemed a little contrived at times.<br />Not quite as realistic or entertaining as &#34;the Sopranos&#34;. I enjoyed reading it
B00A7Q814Y|3.0|It's hard to know what to make of this set.  On the one hand, we have 50 CDs from one of the world's premier orchestras, at the unbeatable price of just over $2 per disc.  On the other hand, there doesn't appear to be any unifying theme behind the selections.  My first thought, when seeing James Levine's complete Mozart symphony cycle here, was that DG was out to squeeze a few more dollars (or, more charitably, rescue from undeserved obscurity) a bunch of out-of-print recordings.  With that in mind, I expected to see Claudio Abbado's Beethoven cycle.  But no.  Abbado is here with Beethoven's 2d and 4th symphonies, but we also get Leonard Bernstein's readily-available 1st, 3d and 9th, as well as Carlos Kleiber's hugely successful 5th and 7th.  Neither does this set focus primarily on how a variety of conductors approach each composer.  Beethoven is represented by four conductors (Karl Bohm's 6th and 8th round out the set); Schubert, Bruckner and Brahms by three each.  But we only have Levine for Mozart (no Bohm or Bernstein?), only Bernstein for Schumann, only von Karajan for Tchaikovsky.  Nor is this a basic symphonic library.  We have complete cycles for Mozart, Beethoven, Schumann and Brahms, but only four of Schubert's symphonies, six of Bruckner's, three of Tchaikovsky's, four of Dvorak's, four of Sibelius's, and barely a whiff of Haydn (five symphonies, all from Karl Bohm).  Any one of these three different approaches would have yielded a more interesting set.

B0001ADAVK|4.0|Usually I cannot stomach Julia Roberts' show-offy way of acting.  But she gives one of her best performances in an understated way (for a change) in Mona Lisa Smile.  Great film; well  worth watching again and again.  For anyone who has lived through the 1950s, it will be obvious that this film captures the mid-50s perfectly and authentically.  Acting all around was great.  Excellent cast.  Recommended.

B00932A4XE|1.0|As my wife and I sat down for an after-dinner flick, I conceded to watching this movie as it was my wife's turn for a movie choice. So, I started playing it and, as soon as I pressed that button on the PS3, the familiar rotating arrow came on. So, we thought, it was buffering, getting ready to show us the movie without any issues. Well, that wishful thinking slowly turned into a disappointing realization that the rotating arrow would be a constant presence throughout whatever length of the movie we tortured ourselves to see. There would be a good stretch of, maybe, 30 seconds, at most, that the movie was viewable. After about a excruciating 5 minutes where 4 would be seeing the rotating arrow, we gave up. I checked my broadband throughput to see if the ISP wasn't living up to its end of the bargain, but, alas, it was pretty speedy. I, then, went online and reactivated my subscription to Netflix, where my wife found an alternate movie to watch. And what do you know, no rotating arrow while the movie was playing. Imagine that.<br /><br />In closing, this is more of a review of Amazon Prime video streaming service or non-service. Not certain what Netflix is doing that Amazon isn't, but the streaming video service isn't ready for primetime. Good thing I didn't pay extra for it.

I can't even remember the last movie I didn't watch all the way through...<br /><br />Paul Rudd, you are awesome... unfortunately, this movie is DEFINITELY NOT AWESOME.
B0060CXAHC|5.0|I've always loved this movie and now my four-year old son does, too. According to him, Stitch is &#34;the funniest!&#34;
1419707299|5.0|Ordered this for my grandson(s)....they are deep into reading all of the series books,and have watched all the movies. I love the fact that they are into reading and love this series.
B00AIUUXHC|1.0|The game is mildly entertaining but its a HUGE gotcha. My 8 year old spent over $80.00 adorning his 'shark' with bling, one charge was over $20.00 alone. That's real money $80.00. Yep, I should have been monitoring him but I had just loaded the game 2 hours prior to that. Who would have thought an 8 year old could spend that much in 2 hours. Look out parents, this game is a HUGE gotcha! I'll spread the word about FUTURE GAMES OF LONDON as far as I can.
B009MO57H6|4.0|This is a great movie with lots of action. I really like how Milla does her stunts and moves around. Would recommend to anyone.
B00BWJ7LYG|4.0|It was a good movie although the plot got a little bogged down with character issues from the back story that wasn't in the book.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|This is an excellent show. I hate it when it goes off for the summer but I can at least re-watch them DVD.
B003HGKJ3W|5.0|I highly recommend this for any a-ha fan. It truly is a great addition to my collection. The bonus demos on the second disc are terrific and I will be keeping this in my cd player for a long time to come.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Should just charge the $4.99 @ the beginning instead of saying it's free. False advertising if you ask me and honestly why do you do that when the games are worth the price.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Love this clock! Great great great! Get lots of compliments on this clock. Recommended this app for each of my children and my sister. Thank you Amazon

B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is a well polished product.  The rewards and well balanced evolution kept me coming back all the time.  It made for a most addictive experience!
B001UTW7QU|4.0|The show is entertaining, but I wish they would tone down the gory just a little. Sometimes it feels like there are episodes where the only hook is how gruesome the 'crimes' can look.<br /><br />If the science were researched better, I would have given it 5 stars.
B0067TGSOK|5.0|This book is great read and offers real world examples of people taking their ideas and passions and putting them to work.  It offers guidlines on to streamline multiple processess in starting a business, thus allowing you to focus on the bigger picture.  The chapters are short and to the point.<br /><br />An easy and informative read.
B00AO7HQ06|5.0|Pretty satisfying if you're a Duane fan.  Lot's of great stuff and some amazing slidework that should have been high lit years ago.
B007VTUYWW|4.0|Love this movie! Angelina Jolie makes a great Lara Croft. It can be a little over-the-top at points, but overall it's a good movie.
B006M4F67A|1.0|Im pissed bought it for the turtle and no freakin turtle layout. Don't buy they lied bout the turtle layout
B005LLSZNM|4.0|My husband loves this show! Its a bit too much for me sometimes though. So watching it on prime is awesome!
B0091REZMW|3.0|I just recently started this game, and so far it's a great game. Once I get more involved in the game I will give another review.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I LOVE this show. I love Joss Whedon, the characters, the story lines; the whole thing is fantastic! Really wish there was more though!
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Could not put it down. It kept you guessing to the very end. I am telling all my friends to buy it
B004W1GCNC|5.0|I love shows like this and really enjoyed the first season, just wish it had more episodes! Really enjoyed it overall though.
B00CBRAD2A|5.0|Arnold still delivers as always. It was action pack, had me at the edge of my seat. Could watch it over and over again.
B005K17RU0|1.0|I had just gotten the old one then after I had gotten used to it it was upgraded to one I cannot use. Print way too small. Too many screens. No place to delete a previous entry so gets filled up with unneeded locations. Wish there was an option to choose between the two...old or upgrade.
B0090CVJZ4|5.0|These plugs are good quality and very easy to use. Wire can be inserted from the end or the side. I set up a surround sound panel in my basement and used these to build patch cables for various equipment. They worked great.
B002M2N9JI|5.0|Normally I get a CD because of one or two songs on the album that I enjoy while the rest just sit there and never get listened to. This is the only album I have ever bought aside from some Beatles CD's where I could listen to every single song and enjoy it. La Roux is extremely talented and Ellie's voice is incredible. I hope that they continue their efforts and make more music like this because the only problem I have is they only have one album out so far.
B008YKRRIQ|4.0|Otto Klemperer understood Romanticism from the inside out. Indeed, few conductors have ever possessed so deeply personal an insight, whether born of intellect or experience, into the stylistic extremes of the period. Plagued for much of his life by what was very probably a form of manic-depressive (bi-polar) disorder, Klemperer's emotional struggles often seem to be mirrored in his music-making; from the triumphal, ecstatic highs, to the anguished, despairing lows.  For artists so afflicted, music can be at once refuge and burden, torment and salvation. Yet only the most exceptional, sensitive, and technically gifted find the means to sublimate their sufferings in order to offer the world something truly, transcendently great. Still fewer get to record with a world-class orchestra.<br /><br />Issued in 2012 as part of a series marking the fortieth anniversary of the conductor's death, this attractive 10-disc box set from EMI certainly has its share of peaks and valleys. Klemperer leads magnificent, near-definitive performances of Schubert, Schumann, Mendelssohn, and Franck, along with respectable essays of Berlioz, Dvorak, Tchaikovsky, Weber and Johann Strauss Jr.  The Schubert Symphony #9 is among the greatest of all \\"Great C Majors\\" ever recorded; the conductor's characteristically deliberate pacing combined with his long, elegant legato phrasing conveys the lyric grandeur of the music as few others before it--certainly since--and the 2000 re-mastering sounds better than ever. The Schumann symphonies 1, 2, and 4 are brilliant, revelatory readings, though, alas, the lax, overly-casual tempi in the outer movements of the \\"Rhenish\\" sap the joy from that most essentially joyful and endearing of all Schumann's orchestral conceptions. Klemperer's Mendelssohn is consistently fine, especially in the dark, misty opening bars of the \\"Scottish\\" Symphony, and the slow movement of the \\"Italian\\". (I do think the laurel still goes to Charles Munch with the Boston Symphony (RCA/Sony) in this repertory.) Perhaps most surprising is Klemperer's fervent, probing rendition of the Franck d minor symphony, a performance that balances keen structural insight with genuine emotion, though it is, admittedly, hardly in the same league with Pierre Monteux's fiery, heart-pounding 1962 performance with the Chicago Symphony on RCA.<br /><br />Aside from the Schumann Third, and a Berlioz \\"Symphonie fantastique\\" that seems to peter out towards the end, there are no real \\"clinkers\\" in this collection. The Tchaikovsky and Dvorak are better than run-of-the-mill--if that sounds like damning with faint praise, the fact is, competition in this repertory is precipitous to say the least. The disc of Weber and Schumann overtures and Strauss waltzes is fine, though not especially scintillating. I do wish EMI's transfer engineers had used the material on that disc as filler on others so that it would not have been necessary to break up some of the major works across discs, especially the Franck and Tchaikovsky \\"Pathetique\\" symphonies.<br /><br />Set contents:<br /><br />DISC 1: Schubert Symphony #8 D 759 in b minor \\"Unfinished\\" (February 1963); Symphony #9 in C D 944 \\"The Great\\" (recorded November 1960 (Walter Legge original engineer)) (re-mastering from 2000)<br /><br />DISC 2: Schubert Symphony #5 in B-flat Major D 485 (recorded May 1963); Mendelssohn Hebrides Overture Op. 26 (February 1960); Symphony #3 in a minor Op. 56 \\"Scottish\\" (recorded January 1960)<br /><br />DISC 3: Mendelssohn A Midsummer Night's Dream Incidental Music Op. 61 (Heather Harper, Janet Baker, Philharmonia Chorus) (recorded January-February 1960); Symphony #4 in A major Op. 90 \\"Italian\\" (recorded February 1960)<br /><br />DISC 4-5: Schumann Symphonies<br />#1 in B-flat Major Op. 38 \\"Spring\\" (October 1965)<br />#2 in C Major Op. 61 (October, 1968)<br />#3 in E-flat Major Op. 97 \\"Rhenish\\" (February 1969)<br />#4 in d minor Op. 120 (May 1960)<br />Scenes from Goethe's Faust Overture (recorded February 1969)<br /><br />DISC 6: Carl Maria von Weber: Overtures to \\"Der Freischutz\\", \\"Euryanthe\\" and \\"Oberon\\" (recorded May and September 1960): Schumann; Genoveva Overture Op. 81 (October, 1968); Manfred Overture Op. 115 (October 1965); Johann Strauss II: \\"Die Fledermaus\\" Overture; \\"Wiener Blut\\" Waltz Op 354 and \\"Emperor\\" Waltz Op. 437 (October 1961)<br /><br />DISC 7: Berlioz Symphonie Fantastique Op. 14 (April-September, 1963)<br /><br />DISC 7-8: César Franck: Symphony in d minor (February 1966)<br /><br />DISC 8: Dvorak Symphony #9 in e minor Op. 95 \\"From the New World\\" (October-November 1963)<br /><br />DISC 9: Tchaikovsky: Symphony #4 in f minor Op. 36 (January-February 1963)<br /><br />DISC 9-10: Tchaikovsky Symphony #6 in b minor Op. 74 \\"Pathétique\\" (October 1961)<br /><br />DISC 10: Tchaikovsky: Symphony #5 in e minor Op. 64 (January 1963)<br /><br />Remasterings from the late 1980s to early 2000s are consistently fine to superb. This set is heartily recommended.
B002C6K7N0|5.0|This cd has all the best song,so far up to date.If you play heavy metal music with a guitar.I say purchase this cd and play along.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This is one of the best movies I've ever seen.  What a message!  If only men would watch it and understand.  Anyone can be a father, but it takes nothing to be a great dad.  Great Father's Day gift.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|We love NCIS.  We attempt to record every episode so we can watch it at our leisure.  For one reason or another the DVR doesn't always capture every episode.  Even if it costs us a  couple of bucks to download the missed episode on Amazon, its well worth it not to miss even one.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|I am a fan of Romantic Comedies and this is one of the best I have seen lately.  The characters are over the top but very relatable.  I found myself growing to care about the characters in the story and seeing a depth behind each one.  Definitely a must see for people who enjoy awkward situational comedy and a good love story.
B0012QVJXS|5.0|Great for kids too, only a couple hells & damns. Beyond that it was as good as I remembered it when I was 30 yrs ago.
B004T4KQJS|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. Krauss obviously knows his stuff, and he does a remarkable job of putting it into laymen's terms. I took issue with him on a few points, most of which are technicalities that don't really change his conclusions. My major non-technical complaint is that he starts off in the introduction identifying the basic \\"theological\\" issue being that one can keep redefining \\"nothing\\" indefinitely - that is, even if the \\"nothing\\" Krauss ends up identifying at the end of the book as \\"no space, no time, not even any fixed laws of physics\\" *does* seem like pretty much as nothing as nothing can be - but the theologian in me still says \\"OK, but that's not as nothing as you can get, if anything came out of it! The 'nothing' *I'm* talking about can't even do that!\\" (This is exactly the kind of argument he says theologians make, and he's definitely nailed that one!) Anyway, he starts out saying that he's not going to address that issue because it's philosophical or theological, yet he goes ahead and does exactly that, basically going back on his original promise not to go there. But I'm sure that's really what he wanted to do in the first place, so I can't say I was surprised. In any event, it's really a fascinating concept to think that the flatness of the universe is profound observational evidence that everything that now is and ever will be is just a \\"temporary\\" excursion of an unstable nothingness - no God required. Other reviewers have complained that he spends too much time poking fun at religion and God - but actually I didn't find very much of that at all. For the most, I thought he managed to stay reasonably silent on those issues, and let his arguments speak for themselves.<br />The technical points I thought he played \\"fast and loose\\" with included the following:<br />(1) Cosmologists (meaning Krauss, in particular, here) have a tendency to speak of how the distant universe appears to us \\"now\\", even when out of the other side of their mouths they're reminding us that what we see actually represents the universe as it was a long time ago - but worse, the farther away we look, the farther back we see. What they gloss over is that in general relativity, there is no universal \\"now\\". What we see of the distant universe \\"now\\" has, in fact, \\"zero\\" space-time separation from us. You can't really \\"roll back\\" the universe into a previous \\"then,\\" because everything we observe will have different space-time separations as you roll back the universe. There *is* no universal common reference frame for time or space, *especially* because so much of the universe is moving apart at relativistic speeds. But, as I say, this is a technicality that I don't believe changes the ultimate conclusions about the Big Bang. I'm reminded, however, of Brian Greene's strong admonition (The Elegant Universe, 1999) that it is a fallacy to presume that the universe is only a single point at the Big Bang. It only appears that the portion of the universe visible to *us* was a singularity. To someone in one of the galaxies at the \\"edge\\" of what we can see, their visible universe extends just as far \\"on the other side\\" of themselves from us as we see to them - places that appear to us to be \\"beyond\\" the edge of the visible universe. In other words, if you reject the notion that we're at the center of it all, you must conclude that the *whole* universe is infinite beyond what we can see.<br />(2) Krauss crows about the incredible precision with which quantum theory predicts things - he refers to this card he carries in his wallet showing the perfection to which the standard inflationary Big Bang theory predicts the abundances of H, He, and Li. Yet later he admits that that same theory fails miserably to predict the abundance of dark matter (and energy), and he says certain constants in the theory must be \\"fit\\" to the observational evidence. Sounds like some major fudging of the argument to me.<br />(3) The final, biggest, weakness, it seems to me,is that for all Krauss' use of the strong anthropic principle (to say basically, \\"We see this incredible universe around us that's so perfectly flat (and so forth), because, in fact, only in such a universe would beings like us be able to evolve. So, it's no surprise that it looks too good to be true. If it wasn't this good, we wouldn't be here to observe it!\\") - for all his use of this principle, here's what I can't get past, and here's where I think God has the last laugh: There is *nothing* about this universe, or Krauss' view of how it came to be, that says it should be *intelligible*. I think this was the main point of Paul Davies' book (The Mind of God, 1992) - it's more than remarkable to find ourselves in a universe in which the random laws \\"that could have been anything - except they have to be such that we evolved\\" (to paraphrase Krauss' final argument) can be *grasped* by the minds that evolved therein. To me, it's more than remarkable - it's a profound clue that the God who *did* create Krauss' \\"nothing\\" out of true \\"nothing\\" wanted us to discover him. The universe *didn't* have to be this way at all. The fact that it is, speaks volumes - and Krauss has missed it completely.

B00CDT41RY|1.0|The only redeeming element of this movie was an ok performance by Leonardo Dicaprio. The story was flat, Jamie Foxx was flat. Why can't we have more fun with Don Johnson? By the way Tarantino, violence does not make the movie. It just makes people sick. One day you will begin to see that.

159102594X|1.0|Started the first book of the acclaimed trilogy because a good friend of mine, a fantasy diehard, had recommended it very warmly. Plus some well written, good humored reviews in Amazon gave me further confidence that I am getting the right stuff, a dark battle-and-blood fantasy was all I needed. Now directly to the points of my utter disappointment:<br />- Similarities with GoT that I managed to spot from the first 20% of \\"The Blade Itself\\": a crippled, ugly, deformed but extremely cunning and politically astute protagonist of some power status but not quite. Short, limping bitter person with scars and permanently aching bones and joints and a good sense of humour... Relax, the author has chosen a name Glokta instead of Tyron... Second, a leisurely, arrogant, cynical, talented but spoiled captain of the royal guard!!! (Jezel). If you need more tips to spot similarities to Jamie Lannister let me give you another one. He does what he does under the shadow and pressure from his very demanding, influential father. Third, a war is pending from the north with a fearsome king, righteously indignant of the past horrors inflicted on the peaceful northmen. Wait, a war is pending from south as well, not Dorne, but from some emperor or something. In short, they hate the Union whose people came conquering some centuries ago, remember the first men from GoT?<br />- The Barbarian character (Logen). We are led to expect from the opening pages that the leading character is something like Conan the Barbarian, a seasoned warrior seen his family's demise, fought fierce battles, seen god and bad men die alike, gambling, boozing, the whole package. Then suddenly he is helping some total stranger, carrying him for 40 miles on his back, giving him his last food while starving himself, leaving behind his beloved but heavy cooking pot to mitigate the effort of this humane act, even managed to utter something like \\"Good bye, old friend\\" to the pot (!) to emphasize the sacrifice he had made tosave this total stranger. Very feminine and moving, and quite romantic!<br />- The episode that broke my resolution to read through the end of at least the first book. An embassy from the self-proclaimed king of the north has arrived in the capital to seek audience with the king. One of them is a cloaked giant of a man, no face visible but very daunting. First they meet the Chancellor and the dialogue goes something like \\"Why are you here?\\"... the fierce iron-hard northern barbarians go like: \\"We want to offer peace and a gift to the king.\\". Something smells here, right? Well, not for the Chancellor who goes like: \\"Really? Perfect tomorrow you will meet the guy!\\" and that's it! No due diligence as to what the gift is in the wooden box they carry, what exactly the peace offer is, any strings attached. Hey, who cares, the Chancellor is stupid, he has just insulted a poor man 5 minutes ago, kicked the poor chap out of the audience room denying him the king's justice and protection. So, let's make him look stupid. The next day the king who happens to be an imbecile is ushered and immediately after him the barbarians follow suit. And what a surprise, they did not come to offer peace or a gift! Duh! The \\"gift is \\"their own lives\\" if they submit to the king of the north and the peace offer is on the condition that the Union (of not 7 kingdoms but 3 or 4, I think) surrenders the north. Wait, it gets better, the giant gets all naked, covered in runes, grabs a knife from the wooden box and challenges a champion to come out and sort this out as a real man. Every single of the dozens of king's men present and well armed there is already evacuating bladders and bowels in the face of this fierce, implying pending defeat in a war with the north, mountain that walks (may ride later in the book, don't know). So, the noble savages stride out unmolested and the stunned audience start quarreling... uh, instead of butchering the impertinent envoys.<br /><br />If you are still not swayed by the above points, I wish you a pleasant read of the book. Really!<br /><br />Oh, and by the way, the barbarian for some obscure reason finds the powerful Magi, a total stranger with some unknown mission for our tough guy, they exchange a glance or two, hold hands and become very good friends after 10 minutes. The kind of complex human interaction and deep relationships any reader likes to explore.

B00BC24NT4|4.0|With the Cold War relegated to history, Le Carre has for 20 years delivered up more compelling, hard to put down, immensely well written books.  A Delicate Truth is no exception, and one of his better novels of this era.  Well crafted, rich in vocabulary, steadily moving, with some well exploited  and some new character types.  Mixing in private sector war fighting using a terrorist motif, Le Carre brings to life some of the challenging moral dilemmas facing the western world today.  Combining staid British Foreign Office conservatism with modern political events and newer technological capabilities, le Carre preserves some of his classic stylistic imagery while bringing in sufficient novelty to assure freshness to the book, and thus avoid entrapment of tedious repetition.  Complicity between public and private sector, in a multinational setting, leads to a bungled operation on British soil, to be covered up by all players but one or two.  The ending is satisfying, yet leaves ample uncertainty to satisfy both the optimistic and pessimistic readers...

This movie was a little far fetched than the first and that is why i gave it the rating. But if you just plain cute movies then you would like this one.<br />It is very innocent as the first movie. I love both these movies for my 10 yr especially it teaches her what well behaved means.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is a fantastic show.  I watched it on my Kindle and just loved it.  Again, Thank you very much.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have to say, this was very well done for a mobile version. I was expecting a lot of limitations on what to build, but it seems very good.<br />Although it's a smaller world than the computer version, it's very large and there's much to do.<br />Hoping for more updates, and will enjoy it till then.
B005LMEB8E|5.0|Most of the songs on this album were very enjoyable. All of her albums are good, but this one is my favorite so far. Demi is a very talented artist.
B0031RS8AI|4.0|Great easy reading book, couldn't put it down, quite funny at times<br />Definitely worth reading, will read more of Sophie Kinsella books
B00BF123WG|5.0|Great Movie! I enjoyed the whole movie. It was done very well. God acting and length was just right.<br />Thanks
B008WCP2PG|5.0|The movie was so awesome I loved every moment every second of it. Channing Tatium is so hot!  I watch it very often.
B00AJER3SE|1.0|If you're not going to create a PROPER 5.1 using the ORIGINAL audio stems (rather than the inferior \\"enhanced\\" version that has bastardized this movie for years)...<br />Then PLEASE release this with the ORIGINAL mono track. - Otherwise this is just poorly manufactured revisionist history (see also Star Wars: \\"Special Editions\\")
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|This one is my new favorite!! Listen to it all the time!! It stays in my car so it's always available!
157330087X|5.0|If you want to hear an allstar jam of top guitarists doing Stevie Ray, you can't beat this. The CD's for your ipod, but the DVD is a must to experience the concert as if you were there, seeing what the artists are actually doing, and their joy.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|This is one of two Bruno Mars cds I own! I love every song on the cd and THAT doesn't happen very often for me!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I absolutely love this book everything is great about it! The charactets are well dveloped and the storyline is amazing.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Upgraded my rating from 2 stars to 5. Had problems with the app but uninstalled and re-installed and now I can find the hourly reports. The new interface is great.
B004JQN364|3.0|Not bad.  It looked bigger in the pictures.  With all the glowing reviews, I expected more.  One two three four five.
B00BR476TG|5.0|This extended preview told just enough and not too much to ruin the film. I haven't yet seen the movie, but this makes me want to!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I HAVE PLAYED MANY GAME APPS BUT THIS IS THE MOST INTELLIGENT AND CREATIVE GAME I HAVE EVER SEEN. IT SHOWS YOU HOW SOPHISTICATED<br /> THE  KINDLE FIRE CAN BE.
B009GED3HS|3.0|I like HIMYM a lot. That's the reason why I did not wait for Netflix to streamline the chapters. However, this season showed lack of ideas; 2 or 3 chapters were quite good but the rest, below average. Guess Season 9 will be the last one so hope a comeback.
B000A7DVR2|5.0|Probably will go down as the most iconic movie of the 90's for me looking back in 20 more years.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Excellent book, particularly if you don't believe this government about what happened.  Easy reading and very enjoyable.  Would recommend it to everyone
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is a story you will never forget. Very well developed characters that you will absolutely fall in love with. It was one of those books that I never wanted to end.<br />It is a very emotional read, dealing with some very serious issues. It's a story about friendship, love, loss, guilt, forgiveness, betrayals, secrets, discovery... and so much more.
B003IKMR0U|5.0|This game is quickly becoming a classic. It is perfect for when people, who love to play board games, are waiting for the next round of board games to start. You can play an entire game is less than 10 minutes. The theme is really strong and enjoyable. This is a \\"press your luck\\" style of game and one of my favorites to introduce to non-gamers
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I enjoyed this book so much that I immediately bought the rest of the series as soon as I finished this one.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|So far I have liked all of the Angry birds (free and bought). This one seems to be missing part of Cloud City and finding the 5th blue ship is impossible. ANY CHANCE ITS IN THE PART i DID NOT GET??? Who knows, any way, it is fun so try it, but if you find the missing section, let me know.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Amazing story! I read this book in under four weeks, which for me is amazingly fast! I just loved it so much, I was hooked!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I really enjoyed this game.  It was on the short side but I think that is wise.  It would become tiresome if it were the same goal for too long.  I'm looking forward to the next one.
B004GBIE3Y|2.0|I thought it'd be a pretty good movie since it had Galifianakis in it, but I was wrong. The plot and story line are both weak and I regret spending the money and time renting it.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|This was a great show and well done by actors John Hawkes and Helen Hunt.  I would recommend that you research this show on Wikipedia to see who this real life story is patterned after.  What a great job these actors did in bring out the desires and tribulations of a man confined to an iron lung machine.
B00BD62X14|5.0|I don't speak French, nor do I understand it, but Carla Bruni's &#34;Little French Songs&#34; transcends all language barriers.  She's great!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Before reading this book I knew nothing about Chris Kyle, only the fact he was killed earlier this year. Chris' account of his SEAL career and the stories from Iraq were a great insight into what these guys deal with in war and how it affects them and their families. At first I judged him as being a blood thirsty gun-loving redneck incapable of compassion, but the further I read the more I realized how passionate and driven he was to serve his country and fellow men. This helped me to understand what shapes a person to become the most lethal sniper in history. A great read which made me feel very sad to know he died the way he did after all he'd been through. RIP Chris, the work you've done to raise awareness of the sacrifices made by people in the military will certainly make a difference for your brothers in the future.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is perfect for a tablet. One of the best puzzle games I have ever played on any platform
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This book was so much fun to read, great story, great characters that are very well developed. I loved all the twists and turns and I can't wait to read the next one!!
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|The child abuse is difficult and infuriating to read, but the overall book is a good read.  The ending was definitely not what I expected.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|It's the Walking Dead so of course it's awesome. I just hope next season isn't so touchy feely, we want more zombies, more guns and more heads exploding!
B002ZG99N6|5.0|I love this movie, great story line, great action and an emotional roller coaster. Its a must see if you like movies like Heat.
B000YMM3CC|4.0|Despite my girl-friends constant yammering about this movie, I put off watching it as long as I possibly could. When I finally gave in ( do to a deal we made which I cannot discuss here), I was pleasantly surprised. All in all not a bad flick. I SAID FLICK!!
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|I've enjoyed Rod Stewart since his days with the Faces.  This latest effort of nearly all original music, \\"Time,\\" is by far the best album of songs of his career.  I'm not just saying this out of blind loyalty a fan would have.  By my third listening to \\"Time,\\" I recognized that the depth of lyrics and the soulful meanings conveyed in this music show Rod to have grown deeply as a human being since his earlier years.  The songs are much richer for his personal evolution.  These songs harken back to classic sounds of Rod Stewart, such as use of the mandolin, the storytelling guitar sounds and familiar vocal timbre;  yet, there is no mistaking these songs for tired retreads because they are fresh and vital.  Moreover, plainly put, this is NOT a collection of songs from which one or two jump out at you as the best songs.  To the contrary, you will love the familiarity of his vocals and musical styles, while you absolutely fall in love with several of these noteworthy songs.  And, speaking of love, it seems clear to me that Rod is in one of the best times of his life, as evidenced both by the things he has said during interviews to promote \\"Time,\\" and by the love in these songs.  This is not a has-been returning!  It is a man at the pinnacle of his life, surveying the past while rooted in the wonderful present.  Buy it and enjoy!  I stopped back by Amazon to buy it for a friend . . . so this is my second purchase of \\"Time.\\"
B000V39KDO|4.0|It was a good movie but I didn't like the ending, they should have let Leonidas live!! Ha Ha.... History...Whew!
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|If you like Blake Shelton, you will like this album.  His voice is easy on the ear and he captivates the listener with telling a good story and telling it well.
193700788X|3.0|**spoilers** When I step back after reading this entire series I believe Charlaine Harris' mind was made up a very long time ago that Sookie was never supposed to turn into a vampire, thus making all the Eric/Sookie fans unhappy. But they have to come to terms with Harris having to end their relationship because of this. Sure she could have continued to write book after book where Eric continued being Sookie's nighttime lover and boyfriend (vampire husband at best), but she never wanted Sookie to give up the sun (bathing - since I don't believe there was a single book where that chaise lounge didn't get use in the back yard). At least that's what I believe. Is it just me, but didn't we all just want to get around the side plot of Arlene's murder to find out who Sookie would choose as her man? That's all we really wanted to know (not another spinning fairy, murder, conspiracy story). After getting past all that this leaves only one character (Sam) that would really fit with Sookie since Harris wrote all the rest (Quinn, Alcide, etc) into corners with other women (or Bill who is in the same situation being a vampire). I personally like Sookie with Eric, but if Harris was so strongly against Sookie being a vampire spending eternity with Eric there really wasn't anywhere else for the story to go. I wish that Sam had been more of a driving force in the books because sadly it does feel like she settled with him because 1. he wanted her 2. their history as friends and 3. she didn't have to know his exact thoughts since he's a shifter. I feel like the ending sex scenes were a way of Harris trying to make us feel better about their impending relationship instead of Sookie realizing he was just mediocre. I will always love this series, and I know that books won't always end the way you want them to, but there will always be a part of me that wished there was something more for Sookie outside of Bon Temps. I hate imaging Sookie being an older woman tied down with Sam and their couple of shifter kids working nights at Merlotte's. She was made for so much more than that.couple of shifter kids working nights at Merlotte's. She was made for so much more than that.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I loved it!!!!!!! Best series ever!!! I love Rick Riordan!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I <3 Percy Jackson!!!!! Go half bloods!!!! Go Percy Jackson
B00C1BV9Z6|5.0|Such a classic and so well done! A perfect rainy day movie for the entire family. Viewers 6+ years old !
B005IQZB14|4.0|If I could I'd walk the PCT starting tomorrow. If Cheryl could do it so can I. Reading this will make you long to walk 1,100 miles too.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|Not sure if it is Oscar worthy but it was very entertaining. I would watch again and again. Bradley Cooper is great in this!
B00A9T1HUO|3.0|There's about 4 songs on here that I really enjoy and play frequently. I know it's unrealistic to expect his albums to be the same as when he started out, but I miss a lot of the production and tone of the songs from his first three albums. That being said, I appreciate the new material and his risk taking. It would be nice to see him follow Streisand's lead and put out a few amazing albums of Broadway/theater classics.
B007ELLDFO|5.0|Many people have never seen this movie made in the 1960s. It's a great read, compelling story, and I highly recommend it.
B009MYARIK|3.0|I had been so looking forward to this book.  I finally was able to get it from the library and settled in for a good night's read.  I was able to make it through the book, but it was just missing some heart or something.  I can't describe it, it just didn't feel as peppy or have the heart that other Kinsella/ Wickham books do.  I am a huge fan and probably have never rated anything she's written less than five stars, but it just didn't grab me as other books have.
B008US4PBY|5.0|i buy this so i can play two controller in my xbox360 but this only play one hand only , so i must buy another for second hand<br />but i give this 5 star for good quality and good performance
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Love, love, love it! Kept me wanting to read more and more! Glad I read the book before watching the movie, no comparison, the book was so much better.
159562015X|5.0|This book was being bought and used by managers at the Arizona Department of Health Services.  I wanted to see what the hype was all about and so I also purchased it.  Great purchase!
B00CBRADU2|4.0|Classic Arnold.  I loved the constant self references to his age and \\"being too old for this s***).  There was decent action mixed with comedy which was enough to be entertaining.  It's probably a one time watch for me but I enjoyed it.
B005LW5J9O|5.0|This is a rare author with perspective who is able to link events occurring over the course of history to identify how important knowledge was preserved.  It raises the question of what other knowledge was preserved via oral traditions of humanity (practiced in India, China etc.) and used by Lucretius.
B00BESLHEA|4.0|I wanted to be entertained with some good classic Kung Fu action and that's just what I got.  If you expect a really deep plot then look elsewhere.

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Excellent book!!!  Lots of action and mythological references.  The ending was a bit sad, but it was necessary to progress the story.  Can't wait 'til the next book comes out!!!
B00B2QA2F4|2.0|The movie is campy and violent; not bad overall, IF you are in the mood for something wild and stupid. The (C)rap music is a abomination and I had to mute it, which takes away from the overall film. The narrator cannot speak english very well and this deficit also hurts the movie. The rapper takes credit for directing and writing this movie, but I highly doubt it. Maybe he wrote a few words here or there, or perhaps he had a basic idea that he told to real writers, who made the script. The wire work during the fights is especially bad, to the point they seem to float through the air semiconscious. Drink about 6 beers or so (raise or lower the amount based on your tolerance) before you watch it and you will probably enjoy it.<br /><br />*after some thought I re graded this movie, down from a 3 to a 2 star review. I was kind of into it for a bit but in the middle it drags down, waaaaay down, when it inserts a \\"poor me\\" cliche slavery bit. After that bit it started some other exposition that was totally boring. This movie should have been all action and mystery. The Blacksmith, unexplained, was far more compelling when he was a mystery. They need to leave some of the backstory unexplained, so that your imagination fills in the details, and overwhelm us with groovy action and bloodshed! When they do that the viewer spends allot more time thinking about the movie (ie-the Clone Wars, mentioned in the first 3 Star Wars movies (chronologically, not the stupid episode numbers, the ones from the 70's and 80's); my imagination was supplying a far more interesting scenario than the one Lucas came up with)). This movie might have made an impact if it had just stuck to the violence and cool, mysterious characters!
B009JZTOG8|3.0|I loved the first season of this show, but the second has shown a decline in quality, mostly in the writing. Characterization has lost the most, with supposedly complex characters like Regina and Rumplestiltskin riding the Heel/Face Revolving Door until the audience gets bored, or just disgusted.<br /><br />Rumplestiltskin is a raging hypocrite with a victim complex, but we are supposed to find him complicated and wounded because of his past. Hook is vain, and verbally sexually assaults any woman he sees, but because he's pretty and lost his \\"true love,\\" we're supposed to love him. (In my opinion, the best part of any episode is the part when someone punches Hook in the face.) Regina is supposed to be regarded as a basically good person who was twisted by her mother and her circumstances into what she is now, but the problem is that she made choices every step of the way, and there comes a time when the \\"my evil mother made me do it\\" just doesn't work anymore. Also, I find it extremely hard to believe that anyone who is genuinely good cannot understand that, oh, slaughtering an entire village is not a good thing and is unlikely to make anyone love her. That is the thought process of a psychopath.<br /><br />I will give the third season a chance, mostly for the opportunity to see Hook's face punched more often, because the show has introduced some interesting questions, but if they don't pick up their game on characterization then I am SO done with this show.
B008XJM86Y|5.0|It contains solid rythmic piece of hard rock underpinned by super solo from mark tremonti. Great rock ballads and hard rock on 1 record!
B0030A0ZD4|5.0|My son had become a Michael Jackson fanatic after watching his dancing in several YouTube videos. His eyes lit up and he was extremely happy when this movie finally came in the mail. He loves it.
B0049J2BSM|5.0|My 2 1/2 year old and I really enjoyed this cute movie. Now I think we need to buy it.
B005VPRG10|4.0|Is a good purchase, is large enough and detailed, if you're a Star Wars fan this is an obligatory addition to your collection
B009NY43NY|1.0|What a disappointment! It would have been better to not have written another book then leave fans with this sad thing!
B003PIUC02|5.0|Great price, quick shipping, excellent quality. Love this series, beautiful women, violence & lots of blood & action.<br />Who could resist.

B0047WJ12K|5.0|Not many thrillers out right now and &#34;This one keeps you on the edge of your seat!&#34; I bought this movie! This is one of  my  &#34;MOVIE LIBRARY-MUST HAVES!&#34;

B004ZGI1V0|5.0|This is one of  my  &#34;MOVIE LIBRARY-MUST HAVES!&#34;<br />He just does fantastic acting! His movie choices have action, thriller, suspense, edge-of-your-seat, and leave you with wanting more. This choice is &#34;Dusty-Specific&#34; = My own preference: I like that cool &#34;James Bond&#34; acting without the overacting and Liam does this.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|it was a true story.  very suspenseful and moved along at a good speed.  I would recomnend it to my friends.
B003RV43X4|5.0|This is one of  my  &#34;MOVIE LIBRARY-MUST HAVES!&#34;<br />I have to be honest, I didn't think I was going to like it. I have a soft spot for the Classic Si-Fi! This was Out-Of-The-Park-Good! Wish there would be a second.
B004JN1CW4|4.0|Great book, of course can't beat the first but still amazing.<br />A little rushed at the end though. One of my favorites.
0385535147|5.0|With \\"The Racketeer\\", Grisham has created another gripping page turner that kept me riveted from the first chapter to the last. I fell in love with this story and its characters, and I couldn't wait to see what would happen next. This isn't just another Grisham legal thriller, it's also a first rate suspense novel, and a damned good mystery, as well. Parcels of information are doled out skillfully, from the perspectives of several characters, luring the reader deeper and deeper into the convoluted web around which this story revolves. Additionally, Bannister is an outstanding protagonist with which I was immediately able to empathize, and my affection for him only grew as the pages flew by. Though the ethics of his behavior is a tad shady at times, he's actually something of a saint, considering all that has been done to him, and how he decides to treat others in return.<br /><br />Grisham also tackles some familiar (for him) topics, such as fraudulent police interrogations and coerced confessions, the failings of the prison system, and corruption in the judiciary system. Though these have been addressed many times before in prior Grisham novels (and also in the nonfiction book, \\"The Innocent Man\\"), he is such a skilled writer, he manages to make the material seem fresh once again.<br /><br />I listened to this book on audio, and the narrator did a fabulous job. His reading was fantastic, and his character voices, ranging from educated African-American lawyer to hillbilly white boy, were strangely perfect.
B0029QRA1U|4.0|A great turntable especially for the money.<br />Easy to operate.  Provides clear, easy to follow directions.  Well worth the money
B00CKJTVHW|4.0|I absolutely love Dexter. It is definitely one of my top three shows. Season 7 is still very good, but I think previous seasons were better, thus the 4 stars. It's still a phenomenal show.
B004TI1WME|5.0|This is going to be very handy when I'm preparing a deposit. Until now I would add all the checks using my phone's calculator, enter the total on the slip, then subtract them all back out. If I ended back at zero, I knew I hadn't mis-entered anything. If it was off, I had to start over. Now I can just enter everything &amp; verify the checks against the tape. Hooray!<br /><br />It will also be great for figuring out transfers and online payments, calculating unit costs when comparing different sizes of a product, etc.<br /><br />A simple but effective tool
B005LAIGQE|3.0|Pleasant dramatization of a true story involving the rescue of whales trapped in arctic ice.  This is a good choice for adults with young and school aged children.
0374532281|3.0|Liked the book so much more than the movie....<br />But I do have some issues....first, I cannot stand the way Pat is portrayed as a mental midget.....Mother buys his clothes, he cannot manage his meds, cannot negotiate a diner menu when he has $40....leaves a $35 tip....there are a few situations that can be interpreted as possibly sensual....such as when Tiffany is shaving his chest....but he only feels \\"Funny\\" and \\"strange\\" it tickles....as though he is pre-puberty....come on..he's 35 years old and previously married....Cliff even asks him how he would feel about seeing Tiffany in a bikini....to which Pat deflects. But then Pat is also recovering fom a traumatic brain injury, so he had that \\"Rgarding Henrey\\" thing going on as well a his bi-polar condition.....<br />Then there are times Pat acts more mature...I wish the author was a little more consistent....<br />Tiffany on the other hand, in spite of her deep dark problems, is obviously very mature, intelligent, orgnized and a take charge person....as shown in the original agreement letter explaining the terms of being a liaison. She then shows herself in the way she schedules  and plans their rehersals....Also the fact she gets Pats mother drunk, then drives her home from the bar....I'd like to see Pat try to drive a car! I wonder if Tiffany's mother has to do what Pat's mother does.<br /><br />However, the movie, about 1/2 through drops the theme of mental illness altogether and it becomes nothing more than a romantic comedy....as though the 2 of them have been cured by falling in love.....<br /><br />I only say this, because in retrospect I could not see how the 2 of them could ever be compatible....cloud watching chart...ooohhhhh....can you say Orpan Annie decoder ring?<br /><br />Also the ending...was good and well written...but I wish it would have gone just a little bit further.....the ending in the movie was a little over the top, Pat sweeping Tiffany off her feet.....I wished the book had just a littletouch of that in the end.....just a little.....maybe some smiles and happiness they made hat breakthrough?
B00005OAIE|5.0|This was his 1st major lp & it was amazing how he constructed this & I can see why he is a great artist

B000H4TX9I|5.0|I don't think I really need to review this. It's amazing. That's it. I watch it through at least once a year.
B00COHIFQS|4.0|A decent storyline that wasn't completely predictable, good effects, more suspense than horror. Not a purchase for me, but definitely worth a rental.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|this is a movie for the whole family except very young children-all dads need to see this movie whether you are in the home or not if you are a father recommend you take the time
1416955070|2.0|I feel compelled to review this book, since the 4 star average and overwhelming number of 4-5 star reviews led me astray.<br /><br />As an avid reader (and reader of YA lit), this book was recommended to me by Amazon. I was expecting an interesting, engaging plot, characters who felt like they were real people, a story that I would still be thinking about after I finished the last page. That is not what this book provides. Though it initially intrigued me (and I still feel like the premise has promise), the story felt overdone and confused, as if the author jotted down her favorite parts of everything she'd ever read or seen and then tried to tie them all together...and then forgot to keep the details straight. There was a lot of lazy writing/editing, where the author contradicted herself, told the reader rather than showing, or misspelled/misused words.<br /><br />Unlike most of the YA books I've enjoyed, the characters in City of Bones were both too much and too little. There was too much adult behavior and wordy/witty conversation that felt forced and out of place. Were these teenagers, or 20-somethings? There was too little of everything else that makes a character whole and relatable and intriguing, instead of one-dimensional and forced. Honestly, I could not care less what happens next on Clary's journey, and she's the protagonist!<br /><br />True, this book is written for a young adult audience, but there's no need to assume that young people are simple or stupid, or to sell them stories that they could have written themselves. The whole thing reads like a fantasy I would have concocted for myself during my angsty middle school years: average girl is actually beautiful and talented and has an amazing destiny and a dark, mysterious man will fall in love* with her!<br /><br />I will not be continuing this series, because there are too many good books out there to waste time with mediocre-poor ones! I'm unlikely to check out the film version that's being made, but if it is substantially reworked I might give it a shot.<br /><br />If you're looking for good fantasy/sci-fi YA reads, consider the [[ASIN:1442479396 Uglies: Uglies; Pretties; Specials; Extras]] series by Scott Westerfeld, the [[ASIN:0062024035 Divergent]] trilogy by Veronica Roth, [[ASIN:0545265355 The Hunger Games Trilogy Boxed Set]] by Suzanne Collins (of course), and M.T. Anderson's stand-alone novel, [[ASIN:0763662623 Feed]]. If you like history, Ann Rinaldi's YA historical fiction is fantastic([[ASIN:0440228611 The Last Silk Dress]] and [[ASIN:0590460528 The Blue Door (Quilt Trilogy #3)]] to name a few).<br /><br />My rating:<br />1 out of 2 stars for plot, because it has promise and some of the universe Clare created was interesting<br />0 out of 1 stars for charactization<br />.5 out of 1 stars for writing style, because there were great lines and moments, but it was just so inconsistent<br />0 out of 1 stars for consistency, creativity, and care put into the book<br /><br />=1.5 stars/5 stars, reluctantly rounded up to 2 stars.<br /><br />*Spoiler: it is worth noting that the love story is not what it seems... in a truly unnecessary and gross twist a la V.C. Andrews.
B001NEXEEG|5.0|Absolutely one of the best Westerns of all time. I watch a large amount of movies and they definitely don't make em like this anymore.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This was a lot of fun.  Could have been longer but it was great and challenging.<br /><br />It had a good story also. I'm ready for the next one.
B0000T70K4|1.0|I had to read this book for a book club and won't lie, was enthusiastic about it. Sounded interesting and I voted for it... Let's just say that that this book sounding interesting is the understatement of the century! It is anything but interesting... It's confusing and lacks any kind of plot. Our group meets to discuss tonight and I can't wait to hear what the others thought. This is the shortest book we've read and it took me the longest to read because I dreaded picking it up. I'd sit on my lunch break determined to read but found myself constantly being distracted and reading the same paragraph over and over again because I couldn't even get through a page. All you need to do is read the sleeve on the book and it sums the whole thing up. Don't waste your time on the mindless prattle of a story because there's no story to be found. I kept waiting and waiting for it to get better but it never did. My husband told me to skip to the end but I couldn't bring myself to do it. Wish I had though because I wouldn't have missed anything or have been any less disappointed in the end. I read a few of the other reviews that called it a \\"literary masterpiece.\\" Not sure what they are basing it on because my 15 year old kid could have (and probably has) written a better story. I've never read this author before nor do I plan to ever again. How they made this book into a movie, I can't even fathom, but I will say this...usually the movie can't hold a candle to the book, in this case I pray the movie is more interesting/ better than this dreadful book.
B0072NWKEC|5.0|Great atmosphere and plot. Well done detective story! With a little history there, as well.can't-go-wrong entertainment. Read the whole series.
B00AKKTDJY|1.0|---- Updated Review ----<br />**** BAD BUSINESS PRACTICES **** PLAYFIRST does not Play Fair<br /><br />I was curious at first as to why so many people were upset with the developer of this app.  When I bought this app it was FREE on the \\"Free App of the Day\\" promotion.  For the few days that I and my daughter played it, it was a full version.  At the time I was thrilled with the game.<br /><br />Now, they want an additional payment to open up the levels beyond level 6.  All the reviews posted here that speak of a \\"bait and switch\\" are absolutely correct.  It almost borders on misrepresentation which goes against Amazon's Seller Policies and Agreement.  So the overall ratings gained my 5 star input at first.  Hopefully buyers read through the reviews to see just how many former 5 star ratings are not being counted as they should... a big fat 1 star.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, had a &#34;realistic&#34; story line.  I would reccomend this one as a good read to anyone who likes this type of &#34;romance&#34;.
B00C0QOZP8|5.0|This cd kicked ass it's just as good as House of gold and bones part 1. It's short but good
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Very sad that this can happen, the book was very well written, even when it went back and forth.  She did a great job of setting you up to help you understand why she wrote it that way.  My heart goes out to Jaycee and I hope she is able to live the rest of her life to the fullest!
030758836X|5.0|I'm a book snob.  I generally like 3 genres -- depressing, funny or some sort of social criticism.  I get nervous if a book becomes mainstream, especially if it's likely to be sold at the nearest Wal-Mart.<br /><br />Gone Girl is the new \\"hit\\" book, debuting at book clubs around the US.  Its accolades include the NYTimes bestseller list & upcoming cinematization starring Reese Witherspoon.  I finished the book in two days.  It's clever & griping, ping-ponging the reader between two fully-developed narrators.  I have mixed thoughts on the ending, but thoroughly enjoyed the journey.<br /><br />100% recommend spending a weekend with this book<br /><br />[...]

B004QX07G4|3.0|I am a huge Ellen fan and was so looking forward to this book.  Not her finest work.  I was expecting so much better.
B008B9JSD2|4.0|First of all, the details were excellent.  Unlike other movies/TV that gets the details of the vesture and ceremonies of the Catholic Church wrong, these people did their homework.  This movie was like &#34;A Nun's Story&#34;, an intriguing story, but in the end not the ending I was hoping for.  I don't know if I'd show it to a religious education crowd, but still a good movie.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|The character Jack Reacher in the novel is 6'5&#34; and 205 pounds. Cruise and the director DID create the mood and tone of the novels in splendid fashion!
1451648537|5.0|I almost stopped listening (audible.com) because Jobs is a total a--hole. But I'm glad I didn't because this is an inspiring biography of a complex man who put a \\"dent\\" in the world.<br /><br />He isn't driven by money. He changed and revolutionized the personal computer, animation, music, tablet computing, telecommunications. He took enormous risks. At Pixar he poured most of his money to change animation giving it its first update in sixty years.  And my favorite--he hated Powerpoint.<br /><br />He loved the the arts and forgave artists. His goal was to merge art and technology to create amazing products.

B007SGM084|5.0|I have not finished reading the first novel in this series yet, and I'm already hooked!  I hate to put it down.  Great read... so sexy and erotic.  I love the glimpse into an unknown, unexplored world of taboo sexuality.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I am indebted to Cheryl for sharing her heart and life with us, and her experiences and wisdom through it all. What an inspiring and courageous, `Queen of the \\"MF`ing\\" PCT`! Definitely one of the most empowering books I've read. I love hiking and my dream is to do a pilgrimage like she did when my kids are older. I have quite a few holes to sort out myself . Thank you Cheryl!!!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I admit I spend far too much time on Facebook.  It's how I keep in touch with almost everyone, so this app is a Godsend when I'm on the go and cannot get to my computer.  I love being able to check quickly for updates and messages.
B003MS0UHU|5.0|Cute, funny, a charming continuation of the film series. Great family fun perfect for sharing with the little ones. Not too hard on the adults sweet without being too sappy.
159562015X|3.0|The author makes a good point, in that sometimes we focus too much on our faults to the neglect of paying attention to our strengths.  If you are tired of the &#34;rut&#34; you find yourself in as you go through your daily routines of work and recreation, this book will help you to re-evaluate yourself and what you are doing with yourself.  Life is too short to spend an overly amount of time on our weaknesses - yet we need to improve in those areas as well.  We need to find a good balance of attending to both our strengths and weaknesses.  This is a good book, but it has a major flaw:  You can only test yourself once!  If you want to test yourself again at a later time, or if you want family or friends to read and test themselves, you must buy the book again!  I think that is a very weird policy.  But, I guess it COULD sell books.  Maybe.
B006CHML4I|4.0|Keeps great time.  Looks great.  Easy to read.  Love the watch but the strap is obviously made for Americans.  I am 5'11 and 160 lbs (a normal weight according to my Dr.) and I have the strap on the first hole!  Are people wearing these watches on their legs these days?  Oh boy, am I behind on the fashion scene.

B008QMMEOE|5.0|Lots of fun for my 1.5 year old son.  Wish the full version was available for purchase on Amazon.com (you have to go from the trial version app on your tablet.)
B0060MYM7O|4.0|I don't think the second season moved the storyline along as much as the first season. Still very engrossing show.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|I have absolutely nothing bad to say bout this game. the swinging is very enjoyable. I really like how wide open the map is. once I figure out the combos the combat will be better but its fluid and I like it.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Because of the buzz surrounding this story, I ignored all the warning bells that went off in my head as this story unfolded. There had to be a clever ending to offset all these clichéd characters and situations, some stroke of  brilliance that would warrant the raves that this tangled narrative received...WELL....
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Sanderson did a great job finishing this series and wrapping up all the story lines with this book.  Any one who was waiting for the conclusion of this series should be pleased (including the other 2 books from Sanderson).
B00992CF6W|5.0|I WANT MY MONEY BACK. THIS GAME IS WORTH 1,000,000$. ITS AMAZINGLY AWSOME. NOTCH PUT THE PRICE BACK WHERE IT WAS. );
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I find this game fascinating.  You have to poke, twist and try everything. I am very satisfied with this purchase.
B0094KT6J8|5.0|I liked this movie much more than I expected to, and my 3.5 year old daughter absolutely loves it, she's seen it like 4 times now.  The New Orleans setting is a nice change from the usual fairy tale fantasy, and the strong female lead makes for a good role model.  I have to say the &#34;shadow man&#34; scenes were a good bit scarier than they really needed to be, but our daughter wasn't bothered by them.  Hard to say what is/isn't scary for a young child, they're all different, but you may need an itchy trigger finger on the remote just for these couple of scenes.  The songs in the movie are awesome, best music ever in a Disney kid's movie IMO.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Yes there's a reason why this is a best seller. I'll leave it at that. Don't miss out. Buy it now!
B00C391Y3I|5.0|Been a fan since the rockarolla years<br />Saw them then & saw the last concert in Manchester 2012<br />Gig was outstanding even without KK<br />Going to see the \\"movie\\" epitaph this week one off special<br />Can't Wait<br />End of an era
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|Daniel Day Lewis was good, but otherwise the movie is American mythology--a wasted opportunity to explore a really complex and nuanced area of American history.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I am in love with these books. It's an amazing story that sucks you in from the very beginning til the very last word. I almost wish there was more.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is awesome and fun I recommend this for people who like temple run. This game is free and is worth for at least $.99 but they allowed it to be free...
B007KZY1YY|4.0|People seem to think this series is about sex. It isn't, in my opinion. It's a great story about two people. I loved the series.
B009AMAGQM|1.0|While chatting when standing in line to get tickets for another movie with a friend who has also read the books and saw the movie with me the previous week,  two college students in front of us turned around and said they were *so* glad they saw the movie 'Beautiful Creatures' first - because if they'd read the book first they would have been horribly disappointed with the movie itself - and I have to completely agree -<br />this was about on the level of 'Clan of the Cave Bear' for an absolutely  terrible book-to-movie version - which is really a shame as they could have easily kept to the original story and followed up with sequels, but after butchering the story line and the characters so badly, there is no way they could possibly follow up and pretend it was part of the series -<br />too bad, it could have worked well and been worth recommending if they actually stuck to the original story line and didn't mangle the characters -<br />for anyone considering purchasing this movie - my recommendation is to read the books instead - you'll be much happier ! The story line is original, well written, with excellent characters. These books are in the cross-over genre, like Harry Potter, in that they were written for middle-high schoolers but will appeal to adult readers as well. Another nice point is the story is told from the main male characters viewpoint, Ethan - so the books will appeal to male readers as well. Too bad the movie was so wretched, the books are a treat. I'm finishing Beautiful Redemption now.[[ASIN:0316042676 Beautiful Creatures]]
B0080K3J7S|4.0|I loved the story and couldn't put it down at times.<br /><br />I just wish the chapters had time and place headings. I found the story jumped around a lot (especially in time) and it often took me a few paragraphs to work out where the story was at.
B009DP9D6A|5.0|This is one of deadmau5's best albums in my opnion. He does a very good job of exploring new sounds and giving it a continuous but not completely interrupted feel to the CD.

0812971825|5.0|I truly love Elizabeth Strout's writing style and her story telling ability. She is a wonderful writer. thanks so much
0316017930|5.0|This book is fascinating.  I have heard several speakers refer to this book, specifically that people such as sports professionals, musical prodigies etc. have spent 10,000 doing their craft before they reach that level of excellence.  Beyond that this has amazing sociological studies and information about why people become great at something.  I don't even like to read very much and I am really enjoying this book.  I am finding things useful for my own life as well as useful to train up my children. I gave a copy to my father-in-law and want my 14 year old son to read it.
0143038419|3.0|I ahve enjoyed Elizabeth Gilberts early works. This was not to my taste. I did not see it as a true spiritual guide book. It made it seem as if finding spirituallity was like taking a pill. So American
B001GUXJQA|5.0|This  is a great character, Michael Connelly makes Harry Bosch come to life. A great read. Well worth the time and money.
0385341008|1.0|I honestly could not get past the first few pages. Not a book that suited me. I am sure others may enjoy it, but not for me
B00BWLKTOS|5.0|Really love this music!  I hope they record more music because I love their style and everything about the sound.
B000FA675C|5.0|I swore I'd never review another book ever again after finding out that the author of the first book I did review was reviewing his own books. After catching him I made that promise to myself so this will the the second and last (pretty sure) one I'll comment on.  I seriously doubt that Dan Brown would do such a despicable thing.<br />I bought this book because of sentimental reasons. Having had multiple eye surgeries there was a time when I was totally and completely blind. I have since regained most of my vision. During that time and before the movie was made my son read this book to me. He would read it at night and give me a \\"book report\\" the next morning. I was delighted to be able to read it myself so needless to say...Great book and with sentimental value.
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|I will admit that I just wanted something cheap for my Kindle to read on a plane.  I was pleasantly surprised when I got TOTALLY hooked and ended up buying the second book right after.  It is not deep literature, but it's a really fun take on the classic Cinderella story and the dialogue is really good.  There are few books where I find the characters truly witty, but this was one of them.  I love the protagonist and I love all the secondary characters in Scarlet.  I would recommend this for an easy weekend or summer read.<br />(P.S. I'm 29 years old, so this teen literature is enjoyable for all ages.)
B0070Y46UY|3.0|This is a good story that I cannot get out of my head, but while I was reading it I felt nauseous sometimes and just overall I felt bad. I'm not sure that this is a story for everyone, but someone also once told me that everything in life did not have to be enjoyable.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I laughed, I cried, I got angry ... all of it.  Written from the perspective of Enzo, Golden Retriever, friend, and loyal pet, it is a story of love and loyalty, but it is written with enough humor in it to keep it fun.
B004V9MU86|5.0|The storyline is very clever, being told by the 'Grim Reaper'. Hard to put down, to do homework. A bit of humour, alot of sadness and courage.Recommended for early teens to adults.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|LOVED! This game was challenging and not mindless. Helped me keep my mind engaged and active while stuck in a sick . Sick enough to stay home but well enough to have cabin fever. Twists in every turn and soothing music. Usually I turn it off and just keep sound but the music kept interest. Can't wait for your next creation.
B00AYM6JFO|2.0|Sorry, we're really Nelson fans, but this cd is pretty bad.  It may be just a poor quality recording, but it sounds like the great voice is gone. I hope not.
B00B5JBZGS|5.0|Well this is exciting. Disarm the Descent is the sixth studio album from Killswitch Engage and their first since their second self-titled album in 2009. They've returned after four years and with them their original vocalist, Jesse Leach. Depending on what kind of a fan you are will depend on your level of excitement for this album. Personally I always enjoyed Leach's work over Jones', but that's not to say that I didn't listen to and enjoy the albums he was a part of. These two just have completely different writing styles. Jones wrote songs about love while Leach writes songs about life. Neither is better than the other, it just comes down to preference.<br /><br />It's been eleven years since Alive or Just Breathing so it would be wrong to expect the same Killswitch Engage that we were given in 2000 and 2002. Both Leach and the group have matured over the years and it shows on this album. The biggest difference is that the album isn't as raw or chaotic as their first two projects. To be completely honest this didn't surprise me at all. Leach has incorporated more singing into the songs so the music does resemble the work done with Jones a little bit, but his growls and screams are definitely different. The problem with this change is that a lot of fans came in during their time with Howard so that audience is going to have a hard time adjusting. Especially if they didn't enjoy the first two albums with Leach.<br /><br />What was so surprising to me was just how comfortable everyone feels on here. It sounds like they got in the studio, hugged it out, and put everything on the table. It's amazing how good everyone sounds. The band feels very tight and I'm really enjoying the cleaner delivery of Jesse's vocals. Adam's performance in particular is notable. His guitar work and his backing vocals are just outstanding. With that said, everyone involved did a great job at making this album come to life. It feels fresh while at the same time feeling extremely familiar. I've reached a point where this is all I want to listen to.<br /><br />Majority of the album is very fast paced and in your face. You have roaring guitars, hard drums, and Jesse growling all over the place. The only point on the album where you're given time to catch a breather is track eleven, \\"Always\\". It's definitely the slowest song on the album, but it seems fitting giving it's place on the tracklist. On top of the album's main twelve songs you have a deluxe edition which includes two bonus songs, \\"Blood Stains\\" and \\"Slave to the Machine\\", and two live songs, \\"Numbered Days\\" and \\"My Curse\\". Both bonus songs are just as great as the songs on the main album and the same can be said about the live songs. In fact, I think these are the cleanest live songs I've ever heard. I know some bands will record over the live recordings and I don't know if that was done here, but if not they need to give tips to other bands who release less than stellar live content.<br /><br />Standout Songs: \\"Beyond the Flames\\", \\"Turning Point\\", & \\"No End In Sight\\"<br /><br />Overall Score: 9/10 - I believe wholeheartedly that your enjoyment of this album is dependent on when you started listening to the band. I've seen many people online say that they just can't get into Jesse like they did with Howard and that's completely understandable. There's a very noticeable difference between the two and if you don't enjoy his writing style then you're probably not going to enjoy the album. For those that have been down with the band since the earlier years then you're going to feel right at home. This is a very solid album from start to finish and I find it to be extremely addicting.

1484896920|5.0|As a teen I was never a big fan of classic literature, struggling to read generally because of dyslexia. However, I was recommended this edition of the book by a friend and I can really notice the difference reading it in this font. I would strongly recommend this to anyone with dyslexia!
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This is truly a fun game to play. It has you the player tap on objects a pathways in order to progress farther in the game and sometimes backtrack. I puts together a variety of interesting puzzles that make you really have to think. Another nice thing about The Lost City is that it has a thing that allows you to get hints to beat the game. It helps you with progressing very well. Now as for the graphics. It is simply beautiful. You switch the environment around you to different seasons which allow you to progress to different parts of the game in order to solve more puzzles and manybof these environments are true works of art, sometimes I would switch the season to summer just to see the beautiful world in the game, and the music. Oh god the music. It is simply amazing to listen to. I got this game when it was for free and I have to say I am truly impressed with The Lost City. Fire Maple Games did a spectacular job with this title. I am Elijah Maisel and I give The Lost City a 9.25/10.
1484875206|5.0|This is a great idea. The font is so easy to read for a dyslexic such as myself and I really enjoyed reading this novel this time around. I would recommend to anyone!
B00003CXPD|5.0|The title character of \\"Billy Elliot\\" is a boy who dances, but the film is not really about dance. Rather, it is a beautifully-acted tale of starkly opposed forces and their painful, hard-won reconciliation.<br /><br />In 1984, 11-year-old Billy lives in a run-down row house in an industrial suburb of Durham, England, with his slightly senile grandmother, and his widowed father Jackie and elder brother Tony, both of whom are coal miners. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has turned the government against working people. The miners are embroiled in an increasingly violent strike. In this macho culture where the hardship of the months-long strike, economic marginalization and loss of pride have embittered working-class men, Billy discovers ballet when a white-tutu-clad group of girls begins holding their dance class in the same gymnasium as his disliked boxing lessons.<br /><br />The middle-class ballet teacher, Mrs. Wilkinson, sees Billy's interest and invites him to join the dance class, and he begins to learn ballet instead of boxing. Jackie, horrified to catch Billy doing ballet, forbids him to continue. Boys, Jackie says, play football, box, or wrestle. Jackie and Tony both think ballet is strictly for girls and \\"poofs.\\" Mrs. Wilkinson, who believes Billy has talent, agrees to continue to work with him secretly, and helps him get an audition at the Royal Ballet School in London.<br /><br />You've probably heard that this is an inspiring film, and it is, but be forewarned, this is no pretty, slick Hollywood production. The filmmakers pull no punches in depicting Billy's family's grim poverty, the violence of the strike, or the bitterness of English class divisions. In one scene, Billy's father chops up his late mother's piano for firewood. The burgeoning sexuality of Billy and his friends is explored, with his friend Michael depicted as gay/transgendered. The dialogue contains dozens of f-words that may offend sensitive \\"family-friendly\\" American ears. (I have notlived in Northern England, but based on my experience living with a working-class family in Ireland, I found the dialogue realistic.) Mrs. Wilkinson smokes in almost every scene she appears in.<br /><br />So why on earth do I say parents should see \\"Billy Elliot\\" with their (10 and older) kids? Because it shows children that sometimes they have to stand up to their parents to become their authentic selves. Because it shows parents that we have to let our children be themselves and love the children we have. Because, with small gestures and telling details instead of heart-tugging speeches or soaring violins, it shows that life and letting go can be more painful than we think we can stand, but we can survive and have richer, more fulfilling lives for our trouble.

B008ASGP3U|4.0|Normally I donate books I've read to the library to resell in fund raisers, but i just can't let go of my Rebus books.  Ian Rankin is such a polished writer that the books are not only good for the first reading, but to enjoy again in subsequent revisits.  Rebus is such an interesting character, flawed -- yes, but no better to have on the case.  I was afraid Rankin had ended the series so was particularly pleased to snag this one.

It was easy to buy, I like the fact that I can pin-number it so my kids can't buy videos.  I wish I could stream amazon videos no a non-kindle tablet.  But I probably wouldn't take advantage of it if I could, I have a TV for watching movies on.

0670014893|3.0|John LeCarre' is a master spy novelist, and I join him in shame at what the world powers and the military industrialist complex have done to modern government and warfare. The selling out of defense, at the least, is a scandal. However, A Delicate Truth is not the vehicle that will put the brakes to modern trends, nor will it enlighten anyone in need of same. Le Carre' should simply forget the novel and let his feelings rip in a polemic designed to wake people up. The novel reviewed is barely up to standards, and it is simply not very interesting.

B00846REIS|5.0|Truthfully- kinda the same story as 50 Shades except the female lead is not the absolute most  stupid woman in the world & the main male lead is much more believable<br />Also the sex scenes are •much• better!
B00A3XWB10|4.0|Swedish band Crashdiet released their fourth album \\"The Savage Playground\\" in January 2013. While I was expecting a continuation of their \\"Generation Wild\\" album, that's not entirely what we get here. The album is terrific throughout, but it does leave something to be desired.<br /><br />The most noticeable difference between albums for Crashdiet is the production. I'm not totally sure what they were going for with this album, but it sounds more like a debut should, than their fourth record. While the songs on the record are absolutely amazing, the production constantly keeps bringing them down, and good songs would have been great with better production. If this type of thing doesn't bother you all that much, then you have one heck of an awesome hard rock record here. The problem for me was, I was expecting their wonderful \\"Generation Wild\\" album, and this wasn't quite up to par. All that being said, there are some really great tracks on this album. Songs like \\"Cocaine Cowboys,\\" \\"Anarchy,\\" \\"Sin City\\" and \\"Circus\\" are all very cool, but a majority of the rest is decent as well.<br /><br />I would caution people that think they're getting \\"Generation Wild\\" to listen to clips before they buy this record. Let's hope this is a blip on the radar and not the trend.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|The Way of Kings is the best first book of a series I have read since reading Martin's Game of Thrones a few years ago.  Sanderson does a spectacular job establishing each of his major characters and making the reader care about them.  Also, he is very good at creating a world that is distinctly different from our own through his unique systems of magic, weather, seasons, and even currency.  I will say that it took me the better part of the first hundred pages to truly get into this novel, so if you find yourself in a similar predicament try to stick with the book for a while.  I was very glad I did, as I believe this is a breath of fresh air in the fantasy genre.
B000ICZD4I|5.0|I liked the movie.  It told a story in a very interesting and heartwarming manner.  there is nothing I  disliked about the movie.
B00ATSBIIG|4.0|The puzzles are quite charming and beautiful, if not very challenging. Don't know if I'd like it as much if it were too hard. You can't scroll thru the pieces though, which can sometimes make it difficult to find pieces that fit.
B000JMKNJ2|5.0|Funny, witty, cool world, twists and turns to keep you page turning.  Everything that makes a fantasy novel awesome is exuded in this book.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|If you have not seen this movie buy it right now its the best. I had no issues with this purchase which Is always a bounce to me.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was funny and suspenseful at the same time. Read it! It is one of my favorites of all time.
B000UBMSB8|5.0|Extraordinary Movie!!!  Love that it has all versions!!!  Great art in it!!!!  only complaint is one of the holding tabs was broken for the main disc... but the set held it closed tight enough it didnt slide it around so it was no problem... also a vinyl CD envelope was perfect to hold the floating disc in the set!!
B005TVYVI2|5.0|This is a great training device for swimmers and triathletes. With the ability to help set specific stroke rates or pace times for set distance,s it makes it extremely easy to train at your specific race pace and have instant feedback as to how well You are doing.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This is a must-read for both women and men. Sheryl's points are well written and well founded. She has inspired me to do more (and better) coaching with my teams and colleagues, both women and men.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I didn't know what to expect when I got this book but it got me hooked from the beginning and once i finished it, I wasn't the same after. I was so hooked on Sky and Dean and their connection and relationship. It still to this day makes me want to read it again each time I think about it. GREAT JOB COLLEEN HOOVER. She's AMAZING
B004XUMMFE|5.0|The best show ever. Joss Whedon's masterpiece! Cancelling this show was the biggest tragedy in TV lineup history.  There will never be another like it.
B000000QFV|5.0|This is one of the Tony Martin albums..If you liked DIO heading Sabbath, you should also like this..The man has a set of pipes comparable to a wild banshee in heat..not quite DIO, mind you, but very enjoyable to listen to..This one is all about the Norse Gods and Thor's son T Y R ....The title is Norse runes not letters..That might confuse you right off from the start..The lyrics are solid and tell a story.. The song \\"Feels Good To Me\\" is wonderful, as well as \\"Valhalla\\"...Martin stands strong..It's NOT DIO, but ALMOST as good in my opinion...AND I don't say that lightly..I am probably Ronnie James Dio's BIGGEST fan..
B001ANSSDC|5.0|The book was wonderful, I do not want to see the movie since i hear it is nothing like the book.<br />I would recommend this book .
B0091REZMW|4.0|This APP is So awesome! Love playing and gets better as goes on. Have fun and enjoy the mystery search game.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I hear they are making a movie out of this.  It'll be interesting to see how they handle it.  The book is very good and covers the World War on Z (zombies) with anecdotes from survivors from around the world.  Very well written.  Curious to see how it translates to the screen.
1426308469|5.0|As of this writing, there are four of these books (Dinosaurs, Space, Animals, and Why).  All four of them are awesome.  Very well done books with great photography/art (what else would you expect from NG?).  They have great information and are by far the best educational tools in my 5 year boy's library.  He LOVES these book.  He got them a year ago when he turned 4.  In the beginning, he mostly just enjoyed the beautiful pictures of things we had already been talking about.  One year later (just turned 5), it is also about the words and graphics.  He is hungry for and absorbing the details with remarkable efficacy.  Dinosaurs is his favorite but he loves all of them.<br /><br />At only $10/book (Amazon price), they are just as cheap as many other children's books that are only good for a couple of readings.  These are worth so much more.  I keep checking Amazon to see what new books may be in the pipeline (if any).  NG, if you're listening, how about one on the Ocean(s), or on the Arctic/Antartic, or on the Weather?  We can't wait!
B003O86FMW|4.0|When I first heard about this trilogy, I was told that the first book was great, the second book wasn't quite as good, and the third book was not good at all. I think this was unfair. The first book was great, indeed, but it did all the setting up of the new world of Panem and the horror of the Hunger Games. The later books can't present the same kind of new and amazing stuff--they must work within the framework set by the first book. And by necessity, each book gets progressively more and more political. This may be less interesting for young adult readers, but without it, you can't finish the story in a believable way. Adults should find the later books interesting, if not always quite as stunning as the first.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|I've been a Tolkein fan for almost 40 years. How could I not love this adaptation? Even with Peter Jackson's embellishments, it looks and feels exactly as I had imagined it when I read the book in 6th grade in 1976.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|good time waster.  i enjoy this app.  lots of different challenging levels to complete. i really liike that it was free!
B009R659L8|1.0|I've read and enjoyed every single book by this author and I must say this one is just not her best. I can't really pinpoint why I'm not enjoying it as much as all the others. Something feels off. It feels almost as if she didn't actually write it and someone else tried to copy her writing style but didn't get it quite right. Maybe it's the uninteresting, unlikable characters, the jumpy story, the way new characters are introduced every other chapter. It just doesn't flow right. It's not the worst book I've ever read, but it's definitely not up this author's usual standards. The story is interesting enough so I'm going to finish it to find out what happens, but if you're not a die-hard Mary Higgins Clark fan I suggest you skip this one and read any of her other books.<br /><br />Edit: Okay, I finished the book. Somehow the last third of the book or so only gets worse. The writing is just atrocious. Where is Mary Higgins Clark and what have they done with her??? This book can't possibly have been written by the author I've been reading for years. I ended up skipping entire pages of useless drivel just to get to the end of this train wreck. A boring and predictable ending too.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I ordered the 235 pack of bingo creds for $15.99 on Mother's day special &amp; still haven't revived them. The game is fun when you're not getting booted off after clicking BINGO. I also don't like that therevis s limit to how many credits your friends can send you or you need to wait 12 hours or so
B004TI1WME|4.0|The layout is clean and inviting. Keys are easy to press and see. Certainly beats the stock ICS calculator. Like the side by side layout of the calculator and virtual adding machine tape. Easy to read and operate. A worthy FAOTD. Nice!<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />Likes:<br /><br />- The %= button; it's easy and helpful<br />- Has the ability to lock the screen in portrait or landscape<br />- Flexible decimal places; 1-4, none or floating<br />- Custom rounding; up, down or 5/4<br />- Nice large fonts on virtual tape and calculator<br />- Haptic feedback is a nice touch<br />- Virtual tape entries can be edited to include text with numerical entries<br /><br />Dislikes:<br /><br />- Setup menu works in portrait only<br />- Limited color scheme; only 3 choices, but they do look good<br />- Virtual tape can be copied, but formatting doesn't look great once pasted<br /><br />Suggestions:<br /><br />- would be nice if the virtual tape could be printed, or exported to a file or email, yet still retain the same formatting as onscreen.  As it is, the copy and paste method is just messy.  Tablet printing is still very limited, but a lot of us have figured it out, so the option would be nice.  Export to email or a document app may be easier to implement and more universal.  However, the formatting of what's seen onscreen needs to be retained, otherwise it's kinda useless.  Not a huge deal, but ironing out this feature would set this app apart from others.<br /><br />Overall, I like it.  The virtual tape is very helpful and sets this app apart.
B0046B8GEQ|3.0|This is a good movie for kids, it does have spme adult humor as well. Would probably not watch again, its an ok movie if you have kids.
B00CHNKJFO|4.0|I'm enjoying the two tables I purchased a lot...but the Blade and Thor tables are more fun.  These were worth the purchase though.
B005S9ELVC|5.0|This was one of the best action,drama pictures that I have seen in a long time Shawn Peen demonstrates the best side of his talent as the highly noted gangster Mickey Cohen and his desire to take over and control California, this movie is full of action from start to end. it provides a totally different look at the world of crime and law enforcement I recommend anyone to invest in this DVD.
B007THA4FI|3.0|I thought this was an interesting but surprisingly angry or even bitter book. I suspect that some of the anger came from her own experiences as a child. The story was good but there were times I found myself pushing on, hoping it would go somewhere. I was not expecting a grown-up Harry Potter, but I don't think this was what I expected either.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Couldn't put it down.  Loved the use of the stars as a safe haven and place to go for peace.
B000FC2PKG|5.0|I thought it was a very intriging book, kept my interest from the very beginning. I have read several of Lisa Gardner's books and have enjoyed each one.
B008XG1X18|4.0|my mom has one and I would never get off her iPad looking at all the pins. I got it on my kindle fire and it takes forever to load even when u r in a Wi-Fi hotspot. it also spazs a lot. it will say that its not responding and u will have to close it then re-open it and u will loose where u were looking at the pictures. I would give it a 5 is it didn't have these minor but VERY annoying problems. overall I love pintrest and it is a lot of fun to c what kinds of things people post.
1416550550|5.0|I wish this book could be made into a movie starring Katherine Hepburn as the grandmother.  It is well-written, mysterious, spell-binding, and totally entertaining.  I loved this book so much that I begged others to read it just so we could discuss it.
B00CJ32S74|5.0|There are no words really... This is definitely worth the buy. So many different sounds and voices make up the soundtrack, and it goes together seamlessly.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really like this game because it has horses in it. Horses are my favorite animal it the whole wide world.
B00C7JGDBW|1.0|I did Not like this Movie.. Oz was a Womanizer. James Franco is just Grinning all the time. At the end you Cannot even take him Seriously. Michelle Williams was the best as Glenda. Yet even her performance could Not save this Movie. I just wanted to get up & leave or least go to the bathroom. Felt like I wasn't missing  much. The wicked witch goes off the Deep end when she realizes Oz womanized & lied to her. Bad Example for young Girls to see. Disney is losing it.. Also trying to turn Merida from Brave into a Barbie. Horrifying. Go to the Petition. Say No To Merida Makeover. The Original Oz Movie has Nothing to worry about by this movie.
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|I found this movie to be not true to the facts.<br /><br />Lincoln was not popular in his time as portrayed in this movie. Like many who make hard choices during their tenure as leaders, Lincoln was, in his time, a very polarizing and controversial figure who only enjoyed popularity after his death (again, like many others of his stature). During his term, there were riots against the draft, the South hated him (half of our nation) and in the end, he was assassinated.<br /><br />But perhaps the worst part of this movie is that they trivialized Lincoln. He suffered great personal anguish over the hard and largely unpopular, but visionary choices he had to make - depth and anguish which is reflected so well in his now famous Gettysburg Address.<br /><br />I know a lot of people really liked the movie, but honestly, we only made it about 1/3 of the way through before turning it off.<br /><br />Lincoln deserves a better, more seriously handled tribute than this to his monumental life.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Cool game, very addictive yet not easy to master suggest that you spend your money on upgrading your character quickly!
B007V4530A|5.0|Found a number of very good pieces of advice that will be of great use to me! Recommend the book!
B0000017CA|5.0|Have always wanted this CD and I finally got it. It was their first CD, released in 1994. Artwork done by John Wayne Gacy (yes, the serial killer)
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|The movie was much better than I expected.  The HD version streamed really well.  I am looking forward now to the sequel.
B0000035E7|5.0|If you're a Nirvana fan, then most likely you have every album. I needed this one back because I traded it to someone for herb back in the day. &#60;--- just being honest.
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|Love the entire movie, great cast and awesome effects. Can't wait to see the new one and the one after that.....
B0009A40ES|5.0|Creepy. Creepy. Creepy. Creepy. Creepy. Creepy. Did I mention that this was creepy? Oh! Well its also very weird. It's a great movie but very very weird haha, if you havent seen it then put it on your list. Worth a watch for sure!
0811876373|5.0|this is the first book I ever purchased on cake pops.  It inspired me to want to create pops for my family
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Kept me reading until the end and then I quickley ordered the next book.  A very good series for all ages.
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|This was a very well done first part of an awesome book.  Peter Jackson is an excellent movie maker, IMO.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Enjoyed this second book almost as much as the first in the series.  I was not disappointed in where the author took the story line.
B00119ZMKW|5.0|I love this whole series.... What more can I say?  Great acting, good humor, suspense and interesting plot lines.  Great show!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Liked the fact that this final book did not leave you hanging.  It was a well thought end to a enjoyable series
B003YL4LYI|3.0|This book was slow to start for me and it took me awhile th o get into it. I know that there is another book for questions to be answered but I felt that there were too many.
B00BSWMITK|4.0|Better back & forth between Joe & the other musicians. Well orchestration of sound. unparalleled satriani sound and wow factor.
B00AKKGX4W|2.0|I have been reading this book on and off for quite a while.  It is really dragging on.  I am tempted to delete it or make a file for my Kindle for books I can't get thru.  I will try to get further to see if it gets any better but I have my doubts.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|A very nice happy story with a great ending.  Left me with a smile on my face.  Loved this book.
B008LD09LS|5.0|This is a must-have for the AR.Drone.  It gives easy to follow guidance to fly and have fun.  I wouldn't have gotten off the ground without this app.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Up to Vince Flynn's usual writing - fun and keeps your attention the whole time.  If Flynn keeps writing like this, he'll be good for a lot more years.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|awesome movie!!!! just grab the popcorn & a comfy chair and turn off the ringer on the phone so you wont be disturbed
B004SIIBGU|4.0|This App helps to simplify life.  I can ebay anytime I have wifi access.  A decent app. if you're an ebay shopper.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I enjoyed this novel. I will probably read more from this author.  I'm kinda bummed with how it ended, but also somewhat predicted it.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app helps keep the family dressed properly and is a good one to have.  I can check it every morning and be prepared for whatever weather is headed our way.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Suited to the over 55 age group who could relate very well to this. The actors were all excellent in their roles.Interesting sub plots
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Love this book.  Told in a fun, honest, readable fashion.  I have also found it to be somewhat educational which is a bonus. Cheryl Strayed is a woman you can relate to on some level. Kudos to her for getting it together and making lemon aid out of lemons!!! Could not put this book down, a true page turner.
0151008116|5.0|Simply wonderful book. Hesitant to watch the film now, as I can't see how it could possibly do it justice.
B00AS1Q8FW|3.0|The movie came and was great.  But this is not a movie review.  This disc did not have any speical features on it.  Kinda disapointed.  But the quality was great.  The case is good.  No issues with shipping.  Just that one thing.
B004DSX5B6|3.0|This Chinese made tool will do what it's supposed to do, but the spring on the scissors keeps falling away from its' place and holds up the scissor action (this may be a southpaw problem?), and the case is adequate, if you use it in the horizontal position, utilising the 2 straps instead of the 1 strap vertical position (which has been a breakaway problem for a number of users). It is also very difficult to replace the knife in the case because it gets caught by the pocket for the &#34;survival tips sheet&#34;.<br />I would have given it a 5 star rating if not for these 2 problems.<br />The other features work very well, especially the spring loaded pliers which facilitate one-hand operation.<br />We will be making a paracord belt holder for this tool in the very near future to avoid dealing with the supplied case.<br /><br />See ya'
B0070DOHQS|4.0|I love the idea of the app, it is really one of my favorites but I did notice a small problem with the sensitivity of it. Its hard to get some of the commands to work because it doesn't recognize what I am doing for some reason. But I like it and I am hoping that they work out the bugs!!
B008PE9GSA|5.0|This is possibly the best ZZ Top disc in over 20 years.<br />Wish I would have bought an alternate version of it that has 2 more tracks at the big box store...<br />Still gets a 5 star rating, buy it!!!<br /><br />See ya
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Love this series and can't wait to watch the next episode as soon as I finish the one I'm watching
B002T3A4KW|4.0|In the &#34;never could happen&#34; category, this fantasy rates highly.  Both featured stars carry their weight and make the scenario almost believable, but, in real life, a romance like the one in &#34;Notting Hill&#34; would ever take place.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I love this! I'd write a longer gushing review but I HATE typing on the Kindle! This app runs well on my 1st gen Kindle Fire though!
B00000099Y|5.0|Of all Tool's albums, and all albums I've ever had the pleasure to experience, Aenima is the best combination of hard rock and introspective evaluation.  Almost don't want to write a review as it will fail to give this masterpiece justice.
B009EBLCK8|5.0|Just as good as Season 1, but the dynamic between Sherlock and the rest of the world is great! Well written and the acting is phenomenal.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I have wasted many living hours playing this game.  Sad but true.  Think of the time you should be using on more important things.
B00008L3U1|5.0|I gave this five stars this movie is so funny and i would recommend it to any age.  I loved this movie
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game just hooks you instantly.  I particularly love doing the challenges: the daily ones and also the weekly challenge.
B003FSTN5C|5.0|I loved it they are very different to the other NCIS and would recommend it to anyone over the age of 18 years
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|A great adventure that gives something back to you at every turn and twist. Worth every minute invested watching. Thought provoking plot that has you doing a deep mental review as the end takes another twist.
B003L77FYS|5.0|What a funny series it is witty and interesting the characters are so great. I would recomend it to anyone over 15 years of age
193700788X|5.0|I LOVE LOVE LOVED  everything about this book especially how it ended!  I  hoped for it this way from the very beginning!!  I understand why some people are mad but don't let that detour you from reading the end...  you may love it too!  :-)  Also, I'm a true believer that if it's to difficult to be with someone... maybe they're not the one!!  Finding and  keeping a friend for life is way more important!!
B0053O89IS|5.0|what can i say this series is fantastic funny and sad all in one.  The storylines are great and the actors are fantastic.  Thanks amazon for the excellent quality and quick delivery
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this last Wheel of Time book.  I am sad it was the last one and would love to be able to follow these characters in the new world they created.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|We received the dvd in record time and excellent condition we live remote so to get anything in great condtion is a plus.  Thanks Amazon for the quick delivery and excellent quality you always seem to give us.
B000000I2V|5.0|This is the Rolling Stones at their best.  Stripped down and rocking hard.  The vinyl is a 2XLP.  Sound quality is great.  Paid $150 for the recording on vinyl and have no regrets.
B006YTTVHO|3.0|The sort of book you dip in and out of from time to time. Not really anything startling but none the less helpful.
B004TI1WME|3.0|The calculator is great but I am unable to figure out how to add text.  That is the main reason I downloaded it based on the pictures for the app.  Very disappointed!<br /><br />So finally figured out how to add text  just hold on the line you want to add text to.  I am happier now they should include instructions.
B002VJ0576|4.0|There is a good reason they call this studio Asylum. These people are completely nuts. Except that they know exactly what they are doing. The budget for this entire movie was probably less than craft services on one of the RDJ travesties. They are kind of like Ed Wood without the delusions of grandeur. Try listening to the commentary.<br />Let me make it clear that I am intimately acquainted with the canonical Sherlock Holmes and despise works that are not respectful to the character. So the early photos showing an elfin Ben Syder were not promising. However he is no further removed from the image of the tall, lean, well groomed canonical Holmes than is the short, rumpled Robert Downey Jr. After all this is meant to be a knockoff of the RDJ film. With regards to the characterization I would say that Asylum is actually closer to the mark. In the scene where he walks off, announcing that if they hurry they can catch the seven o'clock train back to London and leaving the rest of the group still panting from their exertions in saving Watson, he nails the character as well as anyone I have ever seen. And I have a vast DVD library including everyone from Arthur Wontner to RDJ. So while I would not put Ben Syder in the league of Basil Rathbone or Peter Cushing he is at least as good as the absolutely wooden Charlton Heston.<br />Gareth David-Lloyd is possibly the best Watson I have ever seen and I would love to see him cast in the role in a truly canonical version of the stories.<br />Now as to the dragon. How could anyone not love a claptrap dragon made up of scrap metal and whatever was around the house? Notice that on the control panel is an inverted meat grinder. When Thorpe pulls back on the handle the dragon shoots a firebomb out of the near tail section. So yes I do love a fireball farting steampunk dragon. The nutso rototiller balloon thing little Bobby-Sherlock gets to fly is fun too.
B00994WQ78|5.0|Saw this movie for the first time based on a recommendation from a friend and love.  Very funny and entertaining.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|helps me fall asleep when its hard to. We use it to help our daughter take her naps when she is fighting sleep
B00AYHKIZ6|1.0|Not up to Bowie standards in my opinion. I am a Bowie fan back to '72 and this aint bowie. It seems like a rushed product. Not very happy with it.
0142407542|5.0|This book is very clever, just like &#34;The Gruffalo.&#34;  I enjoy reading this one as much as my child loves hearing it!  Great book!
9056912445|5.0|This is a very solid endgame manual.  It is not quite a primer, being a bit more advanced, so beginners/novices should start elsewhere.  The player that might benefit most is the one who has been through an endgame primer (Pandolfini, Seirawan, eg) but does not have the time or motivation to try to master major works like Dvoretsky or Muller.  This manual bridges that gap extremely well, covering the bulk of the material most club or amateur tournament players will need to succeed.  The introductory article is extensive and valuable.  All the fundamental endings are given, including R vs R+P, R vs P, pawn endings, Bishop and Opposite Colored Bishops, etc. etc. The explanatory notes are fairly generous in volume, and there is enough analysis of alternate play to keep even fairly strong players busy.  I would say that players from about 1500-2100 USCF would be the main target audience.  If you want to be a master, you will probably want to go on to more advanced material like Dvoretsky, but if you really master the material in this book (including rules, ideas, concepts, not just rote memory of moves!) you will be at an advantage against most players in the typical weekend Swiss event when the pieces come off!  And you will be WAY ahead of the typical internet player of your class.  Good Hunting!
B0049J3QF4|5.0|One of my favorite movies. It did not playback well, but I  see you issued a refund and I appreciate that
0307950689|1.0|I just want to keep this very simple.  Read Angels and Demons, read The Da Vinci Code, skip The Lost Symbol and pretend it does not exist (I wish I had), and finally, move on to Inferno with hope.
B000063DIR|5.0|It's classic Ozzy, it's awesome. I think his best album(CD) ever. Randy Rhodes guitar work on this CD is amazing!
0307476073|4.0|I was just halfway through the book when I found myself peeking at backpacking equipment on the internet. This says it all about a must-read book for the 40-something who found themselves strapped to a life they were not expecting and are longing to start a new journey.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This has helped ease some of my restless thoughts. Try it out, it'll make a difference, I sleep like a rock now.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I understand the appeal of this book - the fantasy of control and possessiveness seems to be pretty hip these days. Women want their men to be so obsessed with them and so taken in by them that they want to be owned or claimed, and this sentiment is reflected in books like Twilight and Fifty Shades. Dysfunction is sexy. However, the kinky hook cannot save the writing, which is not developed enough for the subject material (ie, it sounds like a thirteen year old wrote it, and this is erotica). I am disappointed that this book is so popular. I understand that it's the kind of book women escape into, and that's why I bought it, but I wish I didn't have to muddle through cardboard-cutout characters, tons of repetitive phrases, and a rather annoying sense of narrative humor as well. Read it so that you know what everyone's talking about, not to actually have a truly satiating experience.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I'm a working mom who's in-shape and no stranger to exercising. Jillian Michaels really pushes you with combo moves. I'm really impressed with how effective these workouts are. Definitely start with level 1. And I recall reading a review complaining about how she doesn't stop to take breaks or drink water. Well, she tells you exactly why she's doing it. I sip water intermittently and keep moving. Another thing is that she's not annoying like a lot of workout video hosts. She's informative, motivating, and knows when a laugh is a bit of a release. I'm at level 2 and am really glad I bought this.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|Watched with my husband and we both enjoyed it.  It is too as the guy's club didn't play a bigger role in it.
B00005JKDR|2.0|Senders of DVDs need to ensure that the packaging is adequate. This DVD case got crushed and the beginning of the movie is frozen from scratches. If I bought used, I would expect it, but I purposely bought it new.
B00BHU9BV6|2.0|I was hoping for another Pride and Prejudice.  Not close. Should have researched the story more before watching. Would have skipped it.
B000XUOIQ4|5.0|Fun story, great characters, and my the hyperbole is entertaining. Appropriate for all ages. We really enjoy watching this with our two-year-old son.
B0091REZMW|3.0|its a very good game but really needs some work on the bugs. it closes on me constantly and freezes on me would highly recommend it
0062014536|5.0|Prepare yourself for a bit of rambling and whimsical thoughts. I found it incredibly difficult to sum up this book in a review...and I can assure you, if I were to try to describe my thoughts in person, it would sound about the same.<br /><br />The third and final installment in the Delirium series is my favorite of the whole trilogy. You get to witness transformations of the characters, the world they live in, their relationships, and the evolution of a revolution.<br /><br />Requiem picks up where Pandemonium left off. Alex and Lena are in the thick of it and have become key members of the rebellion against the society that told them that love was a disease. A turning point for me was when Lena and other characters remarked that maybe love and emotion can drive you to do crazy things...dangerous things...but the choice of how to deal with that and how to feel should be left up to the individual.<br /><br />Finally, we get to see Hana's POV in this book where she has been \\"cured\\", although she worries that maybe the procedure didn't work correctly and is set to marry the new mayor who took over after his father was killed. Hana has her own internal battle to deal with, as well as external threats from her husband-to-be. She realizes that everything is not what it seems.<br /><br />Everything moves steadily along at a pace that builds momentum for the rebellion, until it is time to act...at which point everything erupts into chaos and an upheaval of the city of Portland. I couldn't believe how the story ended...some people were unhappy that there weren't fireworks or something crazily over-the-top or final about it. I ABSOLUTELY STAND BY LAUREN OLIVER'S CHOICE IN ENDING. It was amazing. It was beautiful. It was theatrical. It was...quiet despite the noise. I was so relieved that the rebellion came in with a roar and the story went out with a whimper. I can't explain my feelings enough to correctly convey what it was like, but it was really unlike any ending I have read before. It was like I was reading and hearing all of the explosions, screaming, and then...silence as I watched the characters take their stand and part in the revolt. The ending reminded me a bit of V for Vendetta...all of the loose ends weren't tied up in a pretty bow, you were free to make your own interpretations and draw your own conclusions. Those loose ends make the reader sit there a bit after finishing...lost in thought...processing all of the emotions. Even now, thinking about the last few pages...I remember the deep sense of satisfaction and hope for our lovely Hana, brave Lena, devoted Alex, and the society they can help rebuild.ead before.

B007JM4CWY|5.0|if you like nonogram puzzles crossme and crossme color are the way to go! much better than flipix. these actually look like what they're supposed to versus the other ones where it's a big blob at the end and it's supposed to be an animal...<br /><br />this is a pretty basic game where you fill in the grids based on the numbers on the side and on top. those are the clues as to how many cells are shaded within a row or column. if you see the numbers 1-2-1for example,  that means that four cells are shaded in that sequence. one shaded, then two connected and then the fourth by itself as well.<br /><br />i started with crossme color back when it was the faotd (that was when i first heard of it) and I'm glad I got it. this one is just as good. i prefer the color just because it gives you a bit more of a challenge but both are great!<br /><br />the best thing is, that ones you purchase them you'll no longer have to pay again. when they update the games by adding more puzzles, you will automatically get them as well with the update. all in all, you will not be disappointed if logic solving puzzles are your thing.
B001XUJMZK|5.0|This movie is one of the all time great middle aged revenge movies. Mel's slamming performance in this film was dynamite and can't be judged by his off film behaviors.<br /><br />One of my all time favorites.
B00CBKXGPI|3.0|Wait until they fix the bugs before buying.  The game itself is fun, but the glitches are maddening.  Were they to be fixed, I would give it another star.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Now my collection is complete...  I've got the books, books on tape and film.  I never get tired of of the wonderful stories contained on all of them..
B001XV09UG|4.0|Really a better movie than I thought it would be!Nicole Kidman really takes it off in this movie!Good Drama movie
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I'm addicted. Sometimes I wish i had more stars/coins, but you just have to wait for them to come. It's fun.
B00COHIFQS|5.0|This movie gave me nightmares....I love it !! they don't make many movies like this one, anymore. It's a must add to the collection!!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|You never know what your buying from people you've never done business with, I read reviews, saw a few negative and purchased anyway. All in it does the job. It's a little tighter then my original cord, but it works fine and charges my phone as well. (added bonus just like the original since theyre the same plug) It shipped fast, It was priced well... and I'd recommend it as a replacement.
