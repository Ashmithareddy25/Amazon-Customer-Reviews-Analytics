B00CL151G4|5.0|Did not expect to enjoy the show so much.  Interesting personalities, progression of the stories, and thinking.  Not like anything I have seen on television.
B0047Y17P2|5.0|This is likely his best yet!  This was a real page turner!  It was most definitely  my Favorite Michael Connelly book
B009NF54ZE|5.0|I abso,utely love. Pirate Adventures 2, it challenged me and keeps my mind working.  I like having to think which is good for me.  For those who like pirate games, I would recommend this game to you.
B005LAIH2M|5.0|This movie is great if you like sci-fi action. There are plenty of good looking ladies to look at, and the movie is pretty bloody as well. It is very entertaining! I will watch this multiple times for sure.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|It does what I need it to do! I just don't know how to use or show the individual page display that shows up on the left plan while using the PC use. Other than that it works for me.
B00B5HQL50|3.0|This was rated in the ok category for me on the first viewing. Plot was far too convoluted and Javier Bardem's character was way over the top for me. I'll have to watch it a few more times to see if it grows on me.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|It does not live up to the hype and expectations fell very short. I would not recommend it. Piece of .....How can I rate it 0 stars ???
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|Unbelievable anyone played this for long. attempts to force you to either spam network on facebook or else pay for boosters lives and any number of other things. poorly programmed....amazing how many times there are &quot;no more moves&quot;  and the board needs reshuffled even early on. Due to the random nature which is designed for you to fail this is really just a game of blind luck and very little skill. Continual trial and error is the only way to get ahead....that and waiting for a board that can actually be played thru.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I enjoy the game very much but I notice they don't always give you good candies to play with.  It seems they make you play it for a certain amount of time before they send you good moves to win and go on to another level.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Wish it would never end!! Hope for more books!! You should read it! It is totally awesome! Enjoy the book!
B00CATSONE|4.0|It was very interesting to learn of Tesla's innovation and interaction with early industrialists. I enjoyed it a lot, but it got too long for me and I put it down. It is just not a gripping story, but one I will probably return to in the futures.
1400044162|5.0|Chimamanda Adichie is a fantastic writer.  People who lived through the Nigerian &#34;Civil War&#34; as many Americans who have experienced war, are not open to talking about the agony.  Chimamanda listened and researched very carefully and wrote a novel which captures the facts and emotions of those years.  Bless her.  She is a very gifted writer and we look forward to many more of her works.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Great tools for practicing manifestation and learning how we control our world.  I have found this an invaluable tool in my work of getting in alignment with the life I dream of.
0316228583|3.0|difficult to follow charactures -- crudity -- boring -- I half paused half way thro it which shows how much it captured my attention
B00BSBR9N6|4.0|This book was way more fun than I expected it to be.  I love to see growth in characters, especially when it comes in unexpected ways.  The Rose Project delivered!
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|I plan to start this plan after the holidays.  When I am two weeks in, I will revise my review. Altogether, I have been following others on the information that's in this book before reading this and believe it to be quite effective.  My diet needs to be low in carbs and wheat because of blood sugar and dietary issues. As well as inflammation--which I have in abundance especially for someone as young as I am.  I want to beneath user; I want to keep my weight in control; as well as my blood sugar and inflammation.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|My wife is a Rod Steward fan and this is a wonderful album. We listen to it every Christmas season and not only enjoy Rod's renditions, but the duets are wonderful. It is a class A Christmas album.
B003VANOFY|3.0|I like it but unfortunately it breaks so easily. A tiny piece of plastic broke right above the right ear and the entire set is now useless. Major design flaw. I wish I could replace.
B000000993|5.0|Undertow is the debut full length album by Alternative Metal powerhouse Tool.  It was released in 1993, just 1 year after their excellent EP Opiate.  This album features the same sound that they used on Opiate.  It is a much simpler and straight forward album than future releases.  While albums like Lateralus and 10,000 Days relied on amazing progressive elements and unique song structures, Undertow features a much harder and more metallic sound.  The sound on Undertow is straight Hard Rock with Metal leanings.  It also has a distant Grunge sound, but is still very much a Metal record.  This is honestly one of the coolest sounding records I have ever heard.  It really just has such a great production style, and I love the thick menacing atmosphere the album creates.<br /><br />The album features many of my favorite Tool songs including opener Intolerance, single Prison Sex, the powerful Bottom, Crawl Away, Undertow, and the Melvins like Flood.  These songs are all classic.  I wish Tool had continued a similar sound for a couple more records, although I do think Aenima successfully mixes the hard rock of Undertow with the progressive elements found on Lateralus.  As much as I love the later Tool records, I will always be a Undertow guy.  Give me this over Aenima and Lateralus any day of the week.  If I had to recommend one Tool album to get it would be this one without a doubt.  If you like the style on this, I highly recommend their EP Opiate as well.
B0029LCJJS|4.0|This series has storytelling that is exciting and entertaining, with an excellent cast... makes me want to download season two right away!
B00GO95TAC|4.0|Day of the Doctor was good and did exactly what it needed to do for the 50th anniversary. The comedic elements between the three doctors were really funny, and the movie gave us our first real interaction with the Time War, the horrible decision that was made, and the effect it had on everyday people. John Hurt did a great job playing the War Doctor and all the characters were played well, though Elizabeth was probably the weakest. Matt Smith and David Tennant worked well together and you could tell they really enjoyed what they were doing. The choice of the Zygons as the primary villain worked though I do wonder if they could have come up with something better or really used the Daleks more than they did in the anniversary.<br /><br />If I had to point to anything that didn't completely work for me I would say it was the Billie Piper Bad Wolf character from the show. I enjoyed seeing her again, but it was disappointing that there was never any interaction between her and David Tennant. The Rose/Doctor relationship was a big part of why the show was successful at the time. in the 50th she was just the face they used to play the artifact that was going to be used to end the Time War.<br /><br />I also had held out hope we would see more of the actual old doctors and not just CGI. The 50th anniversary is a big deal that all should be involved in. Most disappointing was no Christopher Eccleston, even if it was just to finish the regeneration sequence from the War Doctor to the 9th. The older doctors are involved in other 50th anniversary projects outside of this episode, which is good to see, but no matter how good Day of the Doctor was, it does bother me on some level that everyone wasn't in it, even if they had to play other characters.<br /><br />I had the privilege of watching this in 3D at the local theater, and I went really not being sure if I would be one of the only people going, when the reality was we packed that theater full of Doctor Who fans. Its been a long time since I went to anything where people were cheering and it felt good. Day of the Doctor is worth seeing, but it was so worth it to see it on the big screen with all the other Who fans out there.ong time since I went to anything where people were cheering and it felt good.

B0016ITO98|5.0|This is just one of the Christmas classics that I love to watch during the season. Sweet movie and great cast.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think this game is awesome! I love it! I especially like the materials! If anyone is looking for the Enderdragon portal in Survival Mode; try digging underwater. My friend told me that.
B00C0ALZ0W|3.0|Remote: Office Not Required is a guide for theses items:  convince an employer to allow their workers to work remotely, and properly setup a team to work remotely.  Don’t expect any current sociological or psychological research to be sited.  Most of the concepts come from pure experience from two successful business owners.  It’s a quick read and it gives plenty of advice on how to work remotely, but doesn’t provide much in the way of supporting research.
B00FLDG52I|5.0|Amazing DVD great sound and picture quality a masterpiece of music Clapton at his best Robert Cray BB King the Allman Brothers and so many other great performances A+++++++
B00514HDNW|5.0|I era this book after watching the movie. I had never heard of the title before, and-although I didn't find the movie particularly good-I found the concept interesting. The movie was definitely an alternate version of this story, but this story is far better. The writing is engaging and thought provoking. I'm not saying it's a philosophical masterpiece, but it's definitely one of my favorite vampire books (a list which does not include Twilight). It's a good, short read and I highly recommend it.
B00B8R1NP0|5.0|Thrilling from the a very first paragraph. The explicit details and unique mannerisms of the killer torturing Stephen is wonderfully executed and drills the reader right into the book. Each chapter has a way of pulling you deeper into the story of suspense and widening plot, forcing you to keep turning the pages to find out \\"who dunnit\\" and why! Larkin and Fairlane set themselves up as great crime solving team for many stories to come (I hope!) It's definitely not a waste of time!
B002QEXT4W|5.0|This is a great assortment of tunes.  After the very &#34;properly&#34; produced &#34;Grand Hotel,&#34; this one is a heavy hitter.  &#34;Is it on, Tommy?&#34;  Yes it is!  &#34;Nothing But the Truth&#34; is great hard stuff, with heavy band and a great Brooker vocal.  &#34;Beyond the Pale&#34; is a personal favorite, with dreams, adventure and humor.  &#34;Strong as Samson&#34; makes its point about our human &#34;condition.&#34;  &#34;The Idol&#34; has it all: drama, great vocal and melody, and a fantastic slow-handed guitar break.  The &#34;Thin End of the Wedge&#34; is my favorite--very freaky, a cool piece of music.  &#34;Fresh Fruit&#34; is a fun break from the rest of the album.  &#34;Butterfly Boys,&#34;  is a cut on the powers that be at Crysalis, using the obvious butterfly logo to discuss some differences in opinion.  The imagining of Procol concepts was always there in many of their albums.  Here we get &#34;New Lamps For Old&#34; as a closer.  OK; one may take it in as many directions as one wishes, but after so many witty and mysterious cuts, perhaps it's just a final comment on our values, as we grow in wisdom.<br />The bonuses on this disk are great ones.  We get to read all about how the Group was commissioned to perform the &#34;Blue Danube&#34;...and what a remarkable piece of work it is...unabbridged too!  &#34;Drunk Again&#34; is an old-fashioned, uninhibited Procol romp.  Can't think of two better additions for this release.  Careful discipline vs. wild abandon.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|I absolutely love this game! I am so happy that you can play as the Birds and Pigs! My favorite Bird is Yoda. But my favorite Pig is Count Dooko because of his Lightsaber throw. I think everybody should try this!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book is written from a unique perspective.  The power of words and the comfort that a book can provide is awesome!
B00005BGV2|3.0|excellent songs, but i swear i have a manufacturring flaw on my copy, ...skips, ...alot. whereas other vinyl plays flawless this was a let down, buy the cd, its cheaper and more reliable.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|The Divergent trilogy has proven to mimic &#34;The Matrix&#34; trilogy. The first book was awesome, providing a fresh new universe to immerse yourself in. The second book began to fray the characters and universe, but with redeeming moments. The third installment collapses completely, riddled with character schizophrenia, unbelievable plot twists, and an overall ridiculous ending that leaves you regretting the time you wasted on the book.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Played this on an iPad for a few weeks and loved it. Very excited it is available for Kindle now. Very addicting!
B00FAIL31W|5.0|If you are a beatles fan you NEED this album.  And the vinyl sounds so good, so crisp it's definitely worth the money.

B00E3IZIM0|4.0|great movie!!! action form the beginning...must get the movie in 3D because the fight senses are great and there are many of them!!
0452273331|5.0|How can anyone give this book less than 5 stars? It's absolutely brilliant. I've read it more than 3 times. Any Rand's ability to delve into the characters' psychology is amazing. A tale about the best in a man. Definitely a must-read.

B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Great game for how cheap it is so far I really like this game because of the great graphics and I love the customizable guns.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|It's a very easy read with warm, caring and loving characters.  Although it does deal with sensitive and gruesome albeit true topics it does so in a warm and reflective way.  Mary Ann Shaffer developed such in depth characters with her writing  that share so much over a period of time you forget you are reading a collection of letters!
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE this movie!! I could watch it over and over and over!! I think i watched it 5 times the first weekend i bought it! GREAT MOVIE!! Can't wait for Pitch Perfect 2!!
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Great read, Brandon Sanderson does a great job again. This is one of those books that I will reread. All of my friends agree.
B000AARKOO|5.0|Great Movie. I gotta say I enjoyed the DVD version more than the theatrical one, where they cut a good portion of character development, story bits, etc..As a result, the theatrical version had some gaps in the story.<br /><br />I really enjoy epic type movies (ie lord of the rings) and would definitely recommend Kingdom of Heaven.
B00GO95BUU|5.0|I saw this in the theater and it was amazing. The plot was fantastic. The actors were amazing. This simultaneously paid homage to the past while looking toward the future. If you're a Doctor Who fan I highly recommend seeing this. However I'm going to wait to purchase this until the price comes down. For the quality of the episode I would gladly pay the price but it seems to have jumped several dollars in the past day or two. I'm hoping the price comes back down and unfortunately I'll have to wait patiently until it does.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|Hope that the new Star trek cast stays together and keeps on making more exciting action movies like STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS.
B00CGNYDIE|4.0|Shares much of the same logic as minesweeper, but has a few tricks of its own. You could do a lot worse!
B00BMKH5NW|4.0|This is my first book written by Rainbow Rowell. I have to say at first it was a little slow getting into the book but there came a point when I was totally invested in it and wanted to see how it ended. I feel she did a great job in creating a multilevel world in which the characters coexisted beautifully. The ending was very touching. I am looking forward to reading more of her work.
006202406X|1.0|The book started slow, lacked connection and just when it was starting to get good it was ruined by the end... An end which left me feeling  like there was no point to the whole story. I usually read and reread, not this time. Don't even think I will bother with the movie..
B00BQ1D7BQ|5.0|Great straight ahead rock and roll and blues. Fabulous guitar work with keyboard accompaniment, which is why you bought this anyway, right?
B001O1O71C|5.0|I loved this book although it was pretty sad towards the end I would not recommend this book to anyone under 10
B00FEJIVRQ|5.0|Iron man 3 is one of the very best action movies that I have seen in years.  Looking forward to Iron Man 4 !!!.
B0036OS3JM|5.0|I am from the tropics and going to countries with winter, it is always a struggle with foot-wear because we do not really know how to choose the right pair as we are not experienced.  Often, the leather boots that we buy to use for one winter vacation, would not be used anymore until the next winter vacation (could be a few years later).  By then, the leather or the soles would have fallen apart.<br /><br />After my last pair of leather boots 'died' on me one rainy wintery night, leaving me with soaked, cold feet, I shopped around and decided on a pair of Crocs boots for the following reasons: Croc seems completely water-proof.<br /><br />I have used this pair for 3 years now, and I did not have to take particular care of them in between vacations or business trips (unlike leather).  They are indeed 100% water-proof, and the top part of the boots actually provide enough warmth for me.  I have walked on snow, and in rain.  I am just eternally grateful for this pair of boots that is not excessively expensive, and yet serves all the purposes that I need.  Of course, they are not the prettiest, but with the round spacious boot-fronts, my toes are not squashed together (unlike boots with tapered fronts) and I have plenty of room to wriggle around, even with thick socks.

Now, I've had it no more than 4 months and unless i have it plugged directly into the wall with a better made connection cord. It wont charge at all. it makes a horrible buzzing noise and dies. Ive tried resetting and everything. At 4 months i shouldnt be having these issues.

B00ADQPB50|5.0|Many people did not enjoy this season of American Horror Story. Murder House was new and different; it created a standard for the show. The problem is that Asylum is very different from Murder House. Asylum is more horror and almost B-Movie mayhem. That is not to say Asylum is not scary, it is very scary. Asylum is also completely disjointed. Murder House was more suspense and classic horror; it was sleek and glamorous. Murder House was also an easier show to watch, with the romance and the melodrama. Asylum is disturbing,very disturbing. What makes Asylum so good is the character development, especially the performance from Jessica Lange. Jessica Lange deserved the Emmy for her performance and a spot in television history. Lange's character, Sister Jude, is so compelling and complex that it is hard to imagine Jessica Lange in any other role. Sister Jude has a complete 180 in the middle of the season, when the viewer finds out more about her past. Sister Jude is a very tragic character. Lana Winters is also one of the best characters ever featured on the show. She is strong and most importantly, very human. She is not a saint yet still very likable. Asylum also features some of American Horror Story's best episodes. Where the show really drops though is somewhere in the middle. Episodes 7-9 are not really very good. They seem like fillers and therefore very watered down. The season would have had more of an impact if these episodes were made into 2 or even 1 episode.
B000FBJHZS|4.0|Dan is a master of suspense.  Deception Point 's entwining of fact and fiction is ingenious.  I was so involved in the plot and characters that I was sad when the book came to an end. With life barreling along at full speed, it was nice to have a peak at a different world and cheer for the success of others.  Thanks!

B0041KKYEM|5.0|Wow.<br />That is all I can say after watching Black Swan, no matter how many times I watch it. It is the shining example of the perfect film. Darren Aronofsky has always made great films but he really stepped it up for this one. As with the rest of his films, Black Swan deals with how the protagonist's obsessions affect their lives. Natalie Portman gives a flawless performance as a ballerina obsessed with perfection. Throughout the film, her emotions remain completely visible to the audience; she often portrays psychosis, vulnerability, anger, and tragedy at the same time. It is really one of the best performances I have ever witnessed, along the lines of Charlize Theron in &#34;Monster.&#34; Another striking quality to the movie is the art direction. Black Swan plays out as an art-deco film. All the colors and sets create a completely beautiful experience. The cinematography is also incredible. Almost every shot in the film is a work of art, something that could be captured and sold as a photograph. The music, while normally just the soundtrack from Swan Lake, fits perfectly into the film. Perhaps what makes this film so watchable is the drama. The story is interesting and something is always happening that takes you off guard. Black Swan only won Best Actress at the Academy Awards; it should have won all 5 it was nominated for, even Best Picture. This really was one of the best films I have ever watched and it should be required viewing for anyone interested in film.

B008K6CRDE|4.0|These fans are nearly dead silent. I got the stock fans with the Fractal Define R4 that I used for my build and they worked great. I bought this one to quiet down my Corsair H55 which has a fan that sounds like a jet engine. Now my machine hums quietly in a corner, even if I'm running it under load.

B00004YA0T|4.0|11-25-2013  I have owned this set ofBruckner's symphonies nowfor a few yearsand havelistened to them all. I willsample the set not in chronological order, but in no order.  i will take them as they interst meand provide some comments along he way, but I tell you this.  This IS a very good set of the Austrian master'slifeachievementand for balanceI also have completesetsvia Barenboim/CSOon DGG---Solt?CSO on London------Karajan/BPO on DGGand near cycles by Wandwith the Hamburg based ndrorchestra and a healthy smattering of recordings by Inbal(original versions)and Tintner--Tennstedt---Giulini---And , of ourse, Haitink. Sufice it to say , I am an avid Bruckner collecterand enthusiastand am willing to smple just about anyone's go at any of these magnificent creations.I&#34;ll start sampling with the 5th Symphony.<br /><br />  The Symphony #5 in B-FlatMajor uses the 1878 version and was written when the composer was 52 years old.Jochum recordedit in Feb. 1980 when he was 78 yearsold and it runs for an epic 77;28.  IT EPRESENTS A N IMPORTANT TURN IN THE COPOSER'S CAREER,ASHE LAUNCHES A SYMPHONY OF SUCH an epic and massive canvas. here, for the first time,we get an expander Adagio, a large scale scherzo and a glorious and exciting finale.  overall, Bruckner , in this Symphony, began looking ahead to the might y valdadictorian terio of the 7th, 8th and 9th Symphonieswith their epicnature and broad brush strokes of color and mood.  Sample, for instance, the passage from 11:34 to 12;27 where Bruckner weves a beautifulharmony in the strings with comments from some of the wind instruments, notable the flute.  Exquisitemusicsuch as this appeared almost from nowhere and the composer,being pleased with it'seffect,followed up in the last3 symphonies with a similar modelheard in the 7th,most of all.  The coda of the opening Allegro of 21:26, is a magnificent summation in only a few seconds.  If I had the power and the authority, I'd renamethis Symphony the Eroica&#34;,as in Beethoven's 3rd.  Trully, thisis one of the composer's greatest heroic chum's long and sublimely steeredFinale is the crowning segment of this symphony, but it is the Adagio, as in most of this composer's life work that draws our attention most of all.  Jochumdirects with grat feeling and reverence for this music<br />that we can easilysense hislove for his fellow coutryman.  Indeed, both Bruckner and Jochumexperienced manysimilritiesin their lives,it issometime, I think,perhaps not the coinsidence manywouldclaimit to be.  Both men were born in a small Austrian village and attended catholic schools, as they were immersed if the traditional Roman Catholicismthat barely survivesto this day, which,by the way, isthe form offaith that we subscribeto.

B00E8KLWB4|4.0|It's fun but kind of complicated. I like it so far and there's lots of fun tasks. The one thing I don't like us that you have to wait a long time for energy but they tell you when it's full.
0767903854|5.0|I was very pleased at the condition of the book, and it arrived on time!  Also, I love the book!  Bill Bryson has such a great sense of humor!.
B004LROMWU|5.0|Best series in a long time.  Will get the third season when it comes out.  Enjoyed watching in the quiet of my living room with not commercials.
B00DRGQZRG|5.0|Dave Holland is a tremendous bass player and I have several of his earlier cds to listen to.  So it did not take me much to try this one out.<br />I was very impressed with Kevin Eubanks and the guitar strumming and chords that made many tunes toe tapping and mesmerizing.  It is Kevin Eubanks welcome back cd.  He is good but this cd really rang the outstanding music ability that he has.<br />Thanks guys--Craig Taborn on piano and Eric Harland on drums all out did themselves with Dave and Kevin for a very prolific outstanding music cd.  Thanks
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I'm a tried and true Downton fan. Although I've heard many people boycotting the series after Season 3, I'm still loyal. In preparation for Season 4, I purchased this season to continue my collection and re-watch the entire series up to this point. I have yet to watch or purchase Season 4, but don't worry...I will!
B006PZBR8S|3.0|meh, i really didnt have anything better to do. its very straightforward, you know whats going to happen, but hey thats hollywood standard movie style. you know what you are getting into.
B004132HZS|5.0|Bloody brilliant, smart, funny and so incredibly well done. So thrilled with this adaptation of stories that I have loved my entire life.
B0064BWE8U|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, it was fun to read and made me smile, I looked forward to picking it up and wanted to hear what happens next.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Mr. Connelly has moved the character of Harry Bosh to a new level, filled with age and softening.  Harry is still bucking the system, but with a touch of compassion.
B00006ZXSK|5.0|This has always been a favorite of mine. When we converted all of our VHS to DVD, somehow I missed replacing this one. It's been great having it again as I had gone several years without it. It's a classic love story and one I can enjoy watching with my girls!
B00AKEMHCA|4.0|My friend and I play this game on his ipod 5 every day. It's a great game, but I downloaded it on my kindle and I haven't even played it yet because it keeps repeating its download (it got to 100% and then went back to 0%) but otherwise great game.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Could't put the books down - read them cover to cover in less than a week. Very engaging story, well written. Probably not for the true hardcore fantasy readers, but there's a very compelling story in here and many life lessons is such a unprentious book. I have to admit my expecations were really low when I started reading. I was expecting another teen drama, just without vampires. I never got he characters of the Twilight books (which is probably part of the potentail readers for this series as well).The characters in The Hungry Games felt a lot more real and true to life.
B0064NTZQ2|3.0|Wasn't up to Gosling's usually great performances.  The plot dragged at times and not enough dialog.  Got interesting towards the middle and end
B0098460O4|5.0|There are not enough words to tell how much I love this album.  I never was much into this type of music then I heard them preform on TV and I became hooked. I have listened to this album over and over and over  for really hours on end and never got tired of it.  I hope these two have a very long career together.  Jonathan's voice and the way his sings brings joy to the very soul and Charlotte is a very versitile artist. Their version of Caruso is one of the best I have ever heard. After listening to them I went on line to find other artist like them and none I listened to could top them except Il Volo (who has become my altime favorite)
014241011X|5.0|prompt delivery. Great book, enjoyed it as a child and now i'm enjoying reading it with my 10yr old son
B00F3W9NQ2|5.0|This season has alredy been fantastic. Has me on the edge of my seat! Im really liking Damon this go round.
B00BAXFECK|4.0|Quick read, fast moving, thrilling adventure.  Tho ending was a bit slow & too philosophical. Good book for art lovers.
B005PK56TA|1.0|Awesome series....But only one star because I am VERY disappointed that only the first show of the season is free.  PRIME REQUIRES THAT YOU PAY A HEFTY CHARGE TO WATCH EACH ADDITIONAL EPISODE.  After the PRIME 30 day intro  I  currently have,  I would be nuts to  pay for a yearly service AND pay to watch the rest of the episodes.....DUHHHHH!!!! This has got to be the most expensive option currently available for movies and tv shows ever!<br />This a good deal for people that buy a lot of stuff from zon... the free zip ship saves them a lot.  Why not come up with a deal just for entertainment...sans the shipping perk..again...creepy, freaky, nightmare inducing, well written, call me crazy, I love this series and all it's characters, show since the beginning of time!
B006M7JCC2|5.0|I enjoyed this book myself, then gave copies to friends who also found it inspiring. Also saw author on TV with Wayne Dyer, and she is charming.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|This seemed more oriented toward adults than Ender's Game. I don't think my twelve-year-old Ender fan grandson will find this as interesting as the first book. Not quite the same sense of wonder. But the story was also more complex, so more satisfying to me. It moved along quickly, as most everything by Card does, and I liked that aspect. I've read Analog for enough years that the piggies relationship in their world wasn't really surprising to me, but it was still worth the read to wait for the reveal.
0385523394|5.0|After binge watching the series on Netflix, I bought this book. I was so curious about Piper's story, and the book fills in all the gaps. Actually, Netflix took much creative license with the story, but you'll still recognize the characters in the book. As with just about anything, the book is much better, and without all the salacious scenes between all the inmates.  It really makes you think about the priorities of some of those working in the judicial system, and it's good to see something good came out of all of this for her.
B000OCXIDK|4.0|I think I liked this book even more than  I would have if I had not seen the movie first.  I know that's backwards, but it really worked for me this time. It's fun to think that there MIGHT be a story like this behind the painting. It certainly felt like it may have been true!
B002ZG994U|4.0|I was never a big fan of the Television series of The A-Team starring George Peppard, Mr. T and others; however, I picked up this DVD at a bargain price and I must admit to liking this DVD extended cut version starring Liam Neeson, Bradley Cooper, Quinton &#34;Rampage&#34; Jackson and Stanley Copley.  After these four Army Rangers were convicted by the military for crimes they did not commit, they use their specialized talent to break out and right some wrongs. Like the T.V. series, the success of their mission depends upon spilt second timing and creative imagination.<br /><br />These four actors play well together and though the dialog was not great it was still a fun movie to watch.  There is plenty of action as the story moves along at a fast pace.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you are an action movie lover you might want to check out this DVD.<br /><br />Rating:  4 Stars.

B00EGMQIJ0|5.0|(4.5 stars)<br /><br />A few months ago, when news of the NSA's &#34;information-gathering&#34; programs were put in the spotlight, I couldn't help but think, &#34;we give all this information to corporations willingly and sometimes with gusto.&#34; In this dystopian future, Dave Eggers slides down the slippery slope of our information-sharing culture and brings readers to a terrifying future.
006202406X|1.0|I wish that had read these reviews before reading Allegiant.  I agree with many of these post so I'm not going to continue to repeat what has already been written.  I've read some terrible books but this almost ruined the first 2 books for me and for the first time I wish I could erase a book from my memory. Sigh.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|The story is good; there were just too many coincidences to make it believable.  Not as good as most Grisham books.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|This utility has delivered as promised. I use it frequently to capture YouTube videos to be shown in a venue that has no internet service. It will capture the HD versions or lower resolution and will capture just the soundtrack from a video as an .MP3 file. Using it on a Samsung Galaxy S3.
B008JFUPFI|4.0|Its a great movie with plenty of action and suspense. The background history is very cool, and the special affects are great!
1609611543|3.0|A good reference book but very technical.  Has recipes at the end of the book which as good to use.
B008CX2A2I|2.0|Could not get it to work properly.  Tried for 2 hours.  Got it to connect one time the never again.....
0307887448|5.0|As a child of the 80's this book was a ton of fun.  As someone who just enjoys reading, this book was twelve thousand tons of fun.  It's a fun adventure story with well written characters and just enough 80's nostalgia to make it perfect.  My favorite book of the year, and it looks like it's might be destined to become one of my top 10 favorites of all time.
B00A1XOPE8|4.0|Usually I prefer full-length novels, but this a complete story in a smaller package.  Every word fits perfectly. I wish it were longer because it was so good.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|We wanted to see the end of the season. This was so perfect for us!  We were able to watch it at our convienience.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Love reading this book!!!! I could not put it down until I finished it. Can't wait to read the next book.
B00CSYRHG6|5.0|Studio Ghibli never fails to astound me. From up on Poppy Hill has become one of my new favorite Ghibli films, the animation is just beautiful and the story pulls at your heartstrings! I would strongly recommend this film to anyone.
B00659N39K|5.0|This is the perfect size for my kindergardner. It is the right size for a small backpack and holds plenty of food for lunch. We have a small freezer disk that fits under the cannister when I send lunchmeat rolls for lunch. The other two containers are great for edamame, crackers, apples, pickles, carrots, what have you.  Also, a little pricey, but it is the kid's favorite lunchbox.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Its lots of fun but you can't go far without spending money!  What happened to the games that are just that....fun to play and play and play without costing you anything once purchased??
B00G7QPTR0|5.0|Hands down the best performer in the entertainment industry right now! It still baffles me that this concert came only months after she gave birth to her daughter and gave more of a show and entertainment than any of the other pop performers out right now but then again this is Beyoncé we're talking about.  I was one of the unfortunate fans that wasn't able to view this concert live but this DVD more than makes up for it (along with the fact that she's currently on a world wide tour ;) The only thing I wish she would've done differently was keep some of the songs she took out.  I know the DVD can only be but so long but Revel had some true gems and moments that were sadly cut out.  LIBAD was a great documentary, people can complain all they want but I've never been one to want to dig into others personal lives and I've accepted the fact that Bey is super private so I thought it was amazing that she allowed her fans too see such a vulnerable and intimate side of her, her DVDs are always highly anticipated by me
1582701709|5.0|Best book I have read in some time. Using the teachings in this book on a daily basis and it has certainly worked. Great book, wonderful shipping and seller. Thanks so much
B00GLX1MG6|5.0|Great Movie, Very funny, alot of fun to watch.  In a strange way, it was a good family movie, however it is pretty adult oriented
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Did the REQUIRED update and now it wont load game at all!  All I get is a black screen!!  FIX IT!!!
B00FWLDHSY|2.0|Probably way better on the big screen. The special effects were good, but the plot was very simple and a bit boring, and the characters weren't very well developed.
0670014893|1.0|This was my first LeCarre novel and maybe I was expecting too much.  But after forcing myself to struggle through 100 pages, I finally said &#34;No more!&#34;. On the fence about whether I'll try anothe one.
1878424319|5.0|Amazing book to out yourself into perspective. Arrived quickly, I read in a day and loved this will buy more books from this author
B00GMONG90|4.0|Pentatonix are the best a cappella group in the USA right now, maybe the greatest of all time.  And I say that as a diehard fan of modern a cappella from the Persuasions on down.  Their incredible ear for arrangements can turn any tune -- from bubblegum pop [&#34;Gangnam Style&#34;] to pure rock 'n' roll [&#34;Born to be Wild&#34;] into an artistic tour de force.  Their bass singer is the best I've heard since that guy from True Image when it comes to *powerfully* covering the range of a synth bass in convincing timbre.  And the beatboxing is near Rahzel level.<br /><br />This is a good record, and it showcases their songwriting as well as their interpretive chops.  PTX clearly know how to assemble a pop song, and all the performances are great.<br /><br />The thing that keeps me from enjoying this record to the max possible extent is that it's heavily overproduced.  The EQ is tweaked so that Kevin's beatboxing sounds too artificial and not human / vocal enough.  Also, the timing is very rigid and not groovily elastic as is their norm, so I have a suspicion that some sort of quantization or sample-and-loop approach was used on the tracks.<br /><br /> I also am not a big fan of the vocal overprocessing -- is big tinny digital reverb and heavy compression really necessary here? -- and the fact that it's mixed with the lead vocal WAY out in front, rather than nicely blended with the backing vocals as it usually is in their live performances.  Also, the lead vocals are inevitably EQ'd in a way that makes them sound very cold, in comparison to the warmth we all know these singers possess.<br /><br />I realize that it sounds like I'm being musician-nitpicky, but the fact is that whoever engineered this record did their best to make PTX sound like any other pop act on the radio, and in doing so stripped them of a lot of their unique timbral signatures.<br /><br />Bottom line is : PTX are great, this is a good record, and you should definitely buy it to show your support for innovative vocal music.  Then, yell at PTX via Facebook or something and tell them to make their next record more natural-sounding.  I mean, seriously, we listen to PTX for the vocal brilliance and the interplay of the voices, right?  If I wanted to listen to a Rihanna production, I'd just put her record on.
B008469DGY|5.0|I don't play golf, although I am a master @ billiards and more than competent @ most sports and games that require good eye/hand coordination and core torque.  Regardless, I love this game and am constantly in search of the perfect swing.
B001O1O71C|4.0|Heavy & sensitive subject matter but handled delicately. I read it first before recommending to my 10 yr old son. I think it will keep his interest and it will be thought provoking.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|I would give it no stars but can't figure out how to do that.  I can't download it to my kindle.
B00000K3D4|5.0|Love this movie!  I owned it on VHS years ago and it was my daughter's favorite.  Now I have purchased it on DVD for her daughter.  It is a great movie!
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|dumb, worst game ever. Don't waste your time playing this crap. Sucks you in at first, and your all like, &quot;Ooh, what a fun game! I'll play it forever and ever.&quot; Then you get to an impossible level, then it just sucks the money straight out of your pocket. It doesn't even deserve one whole star.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I really enjoy the game. I like that it tells you what level you have to reach to get to the next level. I just wish I could earn more free stuff.
B00GO95BUU|4.0|I was going to buy this episode-and I am going to eventually- but why the high price? I mean,at least bring it down to $5.00. Since it is &#34;Black Friday week&#34;, why not put it on sale for lower? Just a thought.
B002MUAJ2A|5.0|This is my second favorite business book. The \\"Four hour work week\\" by Tim F. being the first favorite. It is very interesting to read and has short, to the point, chapters. I read a lot of business books and this one is one of the best ones. I recommend it especially if you own a startup company. Good advise and lots of encouragement.
B00006I53S|5.0|fantastic 'next step UP lens' from your basic 18-55mm kit lens from Canon DSLRs.<br /><br />USM, IS, tack sharp optics make this an excellent walk-around lens for anyone starting out in photography and 'getting sands in their boots' weary of their kit lens.
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|duckz are cool they have feet. and can swim. their bills have nothing on them. dux are the ultimate animal. Ducks will take over the world. HAHAAAAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAGA.
B00EL8I8IS|3.0|If you've read the book and are expecting the same great story, forget it.  The only thing this movie shares with the book is the title.  LAME.  Other than that it is an entertaining zombie movie.
0061978078|5.0|My daughter couldnt put it down, second book was just as good as the first! She raved about how good it was and the twists and turns that kept her guessing
B006VFLIYK|5.0|It was so intense. It kept me guessing and kept my interest throughout. Characters were well developed and believable. I love Baldacci's books and love a good mystery. This one did not let me down!
B00G21XNKU|5.0|As always, Steven Moffat does not disappoint me.  He describes the 50th anniversary as a love letter to the fans and I can't think of anything more appropriate.
B004LRZ2YC|5.0|Awesome movie.  Felt for the charactors different prespectives and views. Great story line. The movie kept me interested and entertained from start to finish.
B00CATSONE|1.0|Once I finally got to the short bit of content, I learned a good bit about Tesla. However, the bulk of the book was simply advertisement for the author's other works. Don't waste your time. There has to be a better biography about a brilliant man.
0061726834|5.0|My daughter LOVED this series! She is big into this type of book and it kept her attention and she raved about it!
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|beautiful in Netflix, chrome and youtube, and that's it.....it would have been 5 stars if it worked with other apps, or ALL apps.
B00AEFZ6V4|5.0|I don't know about you, but I always struggle with whether or not a movie is worth buying.  Nowadays, movies can be rented on Amazon or streamed on Netflix, so when is a movie worth having a physical copy?  Only the best, and folks, this one doesn't get much better than the best (in my opinion).  I haven't read the book, but I've never been disappointed by Neil Gaiman's stories, on screen or otherwise.  This movie has got it all--humor, romance, adventure. Great buy!
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Just got this game but so far it seems to be really good. I like the sling shot action to break the bubbles. Give it a try.
B002I9Z89Y|5.0|Great picture; great sound in the format it was meant to be seen. The behind the scenes footage shot on 8mm by Billy Blackburn are great.<br />The only caveat is that every time the show is stopped, (not paused, but stopped), it reverts back to the beginning/disc loading phase which is beyond annoying.<br />I like to have the next episode I'm going to watch already set up by allowing the next episode to run for one to two seconds before stopping and shutting off the Blu ray. Then, when I'm ready to watch and I've turned the player back on, when I press play the episode should pick up where I stopped. Season one does this but not season two and I can't figure out why this season is different from the first. Otherwise, I am quite pleased with what I've experienced.
0345803485|5.0|This is a really great romantic book. I hate that people call it momma porn or porn at all. This book is really romantic and there's a lot of drama.  I would recommend.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was the best book in the world. After watching the 1st 2 movies recently I wanted to find out what the end would entail. All I can say is WOW!! This book was amazing and I love the way Suzanne Collins does such a nice job ending the series...I want more though!!!!!! These are the best books ever!!!! Team Peeta all the way(:
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love the movies so of course I had to have the game and like the movies I'm addicted lol. I have no problem shutting down the game on my kindle however thanks for the information just in case. Enjoyed the game thank you.
B00DHKKN6Q|3.0|Fun to play... Challenge a must!!! Only down fall seems to be that there  must be two or more bubbles right in a row because a single bubble Will not pop until it's the only bubble on the screen.
B00BU9DXAY|4.0|Such a funny book! Not only is it funny and crude, but also heartwarming in places. If you love your dog and are utterly puzzled by his/her behavior you will get a kick out of this book!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game because it never ends and I don't have to delete it and download sumthing else<br />I don't care I love it!!!!!!
B0019N8P2W|5.0|I love this series and am very happy to have it on DVD. The change of the music doesn't make much of a difference, however in the episode &#34;The Road Worrier,&#34; in the scene where Daria, Trent, Jesse and Jane were stuck in traffic, and Trent makes the reference to REM's &#34;Everybody Hurts&#34; video, although they were unable to use the actual song for the DVD release, some somber sounding music could have been used instead.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Great follow up to the ending of the series. Only wish there could be sequels to somehow keep it running. The cast of characters were great. I dub most of them actors &#34; the sci-fi players&#34; as I've gotten to see many of them acting in other sci-fi television series.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|Good plot, great cast, harrowing flight scenes, accurate portrayal of how an alcoholic will continue to drink regardless of the consequences.
B00FAVRHBE|4.0|Oh, no, the DVD contents don't list the Five(ish) Doctor Who Reboot special.  This really needs to be seen with the Day of the Doctor.  (BBC posted it on their website shortly after the special aired.)  It's a special written by Peter Davidson and is a fictional account of the doctors who *weren't* asked to have speaking parts in the 50th anniversary show.  The two specials compliment each other beautifully.  Day as canon, FISHDR as sendup.<br /><br />It's full of fun humor, but doesn't require encyclopedic knowledge (save knowing who John Barrowman is married to) to get.  Cameos abound, as do appearances from the crew.  See it first, then check wiki to see what you've missed to see it again.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is a great book to read. Yes, it is long but it is worth the time to read it. I highly recommended this book.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Good game wish did not require so many crown purchases.  Overall very fun though.  Graphics are fine for a role playing game
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham latest book, shows he is still one of the best!<br /><br />VERY GOOD, I ENJOYED IT FROM BEGINNING TO END.
031623480X|5.0|Another excellent book on the same lines of &#34;Wheat Belly.&#34;  As a doctor, I recommend books like this to my patients all the time!
B00BC254I8|5.0|This book may not change everyone's opinion of Mike Tyson but it will undoubtedly fill in the blanks in between the major headlines that have formed those opinions in most of us when in reality we know nothing.  In some ways one may owe it to themselves to read this book, namely if you find yourself on comment threads and blogs using lame punchlines derived from this man's life struggles.  I'm no scholar so my review means very little but this is a portrait of a living legend of our time and it is fascinating on so many different levels.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|It is awesome as beck he is everywhere he usually just pop up in it face scary. It is scary.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|An amazing book teaching our children that true beauty is on the inside! Could not recommend this book more strongly for middle schoolers (and adults, too)! Be prepared to laugh, cry and not be able to put it down.
B00BR0SGN0|5.0|Timely arrival and in great condition.  What more can I say?  There isn't a whole lot more I can write as delivery and great condition are all that matters.
B00GP0G0IK|4.0|So far the game is pretty good as far as the story quest.<br />But when I put the ladder up to the tree near the rowboat it goes and stays but nothin happens. Must be somethin else I have to do that I am not sure of yet. But I can actually put the ladder back into inventory which is weird. Guess I will find out later. I keep picking up rings and it promises something extra but my daughter played same game on her kindle and said she got all the rings and nothing happened. I think for $4.99 the long delays going from each scene should really be worked out. Never had a delay like that in other G5 games so that's annoying. Hope the developers aren't slipping. I hope the game proves worth it...still have a ways to go to see.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Great game to keep your brain active, love solving puzzles. Great use of changing the room puzzle solving requirements. Hate waiting for the energy to recharge.
B008ADSDHQ|4.0|New author for me.  I enjoy his writing, style, plot and details.  It gives an incite into the Scandinavian scenery.  Good enough translation.
B00AKL1XPU|1.0|love the game. the graphics are beautiful. the first building game I have ever got addicted. to. but and that is a very big BUT!. I had to download the darn thing 3 times. the first time was great and cool made it to level 25 built a beautiful and spectacular zoo.then suddenly it stopped and wouldn't. let me play anymore. the second time I made it to level 10 and the same thing. the third time made it to level 7 and again I am not allowed to play. WHAT THE HELL!! . so, I just decided to take it off of my kindle fire entirely.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Love the game but need to fix bug. Can't move minion on any of the bonus like riding the rocket, going thru the slides and when on mega minion mode. Otherwise would have given 5 stars.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|A timeless classic that is new and fresh each time it is read. It is never too late for a person to change his lifestyle, as does A groove in this book. An enjoyable read.
B00EY7LT9Q|5.0|The first three episodes were slow, so if you have tried an ep or two from the start and didn't like it, please give it another shot.  The last few episodes have been dynamite!!!  Great for all Marvel fans--like NCIS meets Marvel comics.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book. Will read the next one also as soon as possible. This book is very addictive and exciting will keep you on the edge of your seat.

B002HJ9PTO|5.0|I bought this in the past and returned it because for it to work with my iphone I needed to buy another $30 adapter.  Then I bought a DSLR a few years later. Bought a different  cheap corded mic on amazon which was crappy and had hit and miss quality.  As i searched for a solution, I came across the 3350 again and decided to buy it.  Best bang for buck. Sure the cord is annoying, but because it's so long i does come in handy.  You could get a wireless one, but expect to spend close to $200. here's a video I did that was about 12-15 feet away from the camera. http://youtu.be/l5wVmzQMkvg it will give you an idea of the audio quality.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|Best headphones I have ever used. I have not even used them yet for any high definition audio yet and I am already totally impressed. I am replacing my Ear force X2 with these. I just tested them on the old X-Box Buffy the Vampire Slayer game and have just now realized I had been missing out on half the dialogue! These phones make every sound crystal clear. On one level I had escaped a monster  through a doorway. But now as I continue the level I hear him following me banging into doors, along the corridor, trying to break through to get at me! The surround sound is amazing! Others have complained about routers that interfere with the signal. I have a wireless wi-fi router in my room about fifteen feet away from my video game system and there is not the slightest interference. Thy phones provide a comfortable nice snug fit over the ears without any significant discomfort. I would say they are as about as comfortable as they can be without falling off your head when bending down. The only negative comment about these headphones is unlike my X2's they do not turn off automatically if you accidentally leave them on. There is a blinking light to let you know they are on but you have to manually turn them off to not waste batteries.
1439192812|5.0|Dawkins never fails to satisfy. He guides us gently to the profound nature of...well, Nature. We are the lucky ones, we sentient conscious beings. Once we pull ourselves out of the mire of wishful thinking (aka theism), we shall have the stars!
B0098G7AWS|5.0|This is my favorite movie EVER! If you haven't seen it you need to. The picture is great too. The actors are amazing! I recommend this movie to anyone, especially ones who like \\"epic love stories\\"
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|You get a mandatory time-out when you fail a level so many times, otherwise I would probably never put it down.  I can't seem to get past #23 but I'm still trying!  Can't think of anyone who wouldn't love this game.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's a fun game to play. But it does get more difficult to get thru the levels the father you get. Very addicting.
1476727910|3.0|Great potential in the premise, but written down to tweener level. Really intended for 12-year-olds? Reading books like this makes you want to become an editor/slasher...or a writer yourself. A missed opportunity to express real human issues in a sophisticated way, but not enough depth to satisfy.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This app works like a charm.  I use it every night.  There are so many options to choose from and to make you own combinations.  It even helps soothe my dog, who is no longer barking at every little bump in the night.  You won't be disappointed.
B002C6A6N6|1.0|I gave this one star because the only season that plays is season 1.  After that, many of the disks skip, stop, or won't play at all.  Also, season 5 contains two disks #7 and no disk #8.  Some of the disks that skipped, stopped, or would not play I tried in three different manufacturer DVD players with the same results.  I cannot comment on season 6 as we have not attempted to watch it as of yet. I don't anticipate any improvement over seasons 2-5.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|The new superman looks a real superman , more muscle , action and the last fight is awesome in the planet

B0089EHWQE|5.0|I found this book to be an interesting and somewhat educational read. I was also surprised to learn of certain behaviors that still exist today. There are a few unexpected twists and turns that make it hard to stop reading because I wanted to find out where the author was taking me! Wonderful!!
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|One of the best books I have read. I like this book for its fantastic writing, taut storyline and how each character is defined that they become part of your world. I am 92% complete and liking this book so much that I already want to go back and read this book again.
B00BMR4RIG|5.0|Love this...I can check the weather in London, Mt.Everest to Borrow, Alaska.  Shut.my eyes and feel the weather wherever.  Of course l have a great imagination at 76.

B0041G683W|4.0|This fell behind the perfect cast of the 10th anniversary. I will first state that Alfie Boe, Norm Lewis, Samantha Barks, Katie Hall , and Ramin Karimloo were wonderful. I am usually a fan of Lea Salonga but either she was tired or getting over an illness becuase her voice was not on level weith her usual wonderful singing. Truly, I was nearly appalled at Nick Jonas's poor portryal of Marius. Katie Hall completely drowns him out because of his weak vocal performance. I have nothing aganist Nick Jonas personally but he can't sing rock opera obviously. A loose jaw is imperative for musical theater singing and his jaw was so tight he looked as if he was in serious physical anguish. The production was staged well and the performance of &#34;One Day More&#34; by the orginal cast was a real treat.
0767919408|5.0|Love Bryson, he can always make social history real, the backdrop to most of history is never told except superficially.  He does it like no other.
0385351399|4.0|The Circle takes the issues of Privacy that are becoming more and more important to ask and brings them to bear in a literary setting.  Its characters staunchly represent key positions in the privacy debate.  The pro-transparency idealist, the so-called paranoid, the shemer taking advantage of our openness, the pragmatist, and the mob-prone public at large are all well represented here.<br /><br />The dialog and plotline in The Circle are often over the top. Sometimes, I had a hard time believing that the main character could be so naive.  But any time one character or another seemed unbelievable, I got the sense that the author himself has a great handle on the issues about which he has written.<br /><br />Despite the subject's somewhate abstract nature, The Circle is an engaging read.  The book is fairly long, but I found myself unable to put it down and finished it in under 48 hours.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|Every time I click on a video it closes n says it's not working I have to keep going back n clicking on the same video like 9 times just to watch it
B005H9B44A|4.0|Great movie if you are into Marvel Comics and enjoy action packed movies.  The special effects were pretty good as well.
B0089EHWQE|3.0|Intense, emotional book about a caregiver in the last 6 months of a quadriplegic's life and how they change each other. It was a bit manipulative.
0345803485|2.0|I wanted to love these books, I really did. I managed to get through all three so I apologize in advance if some of my review is not #1-specific. (aka, be aware there may be some minor spoilers)<br /><br />So, the plot -- the concept of the plot -- is actually pretty decent. Attractive, bookworm girl meets lonely, introverted man who happens to be a dominatrix with a dark past. Cool start.<br /><br />Except, it's COMPLETELY unrealistic. Many other reviewers have hit the nail on the head -- this book sounds like it was written by a teenager. Christian Grey is a ***26-year-old*** unbelievably hot, athletic, philanthropic billionaire with a huge penis, whose main goal in life (besides whipping brunettes) is to feed the hungry and bring technology to third-world countries with solar energy? PLEASE. That just doesn't happen in real life. I SO wish the author had made Christian a more believable character...the book would've been so much better. Making him an insane control freak who stalks Ana and flies to her work because she's talking to somebody he doesn't like, didn't make him any more realistic. The character is essentially bi-polar, and possessive to a point that would scare away any female in real life. And, I have to wonder how a multi-billionaire makes $100k an hour when he spends almost NO time actually working (he does it a little more in the third book but it's still an unrealistically small amount).<br /><br />Then there's Ana...her character is almost believable. Almost. She's supposedly 21, but acts like a whiny, confused teen (throughout all three books). I'm not convinced that a virgin in real life would so willingly delve into a BDSM relationship with someone she literally just met, no matter how hot he is. And, I don't think there's a female on this planet who orgasms as easily as this girl does...I swear at least 50 (no pun intended) full pages of this book are devoted entirely to her boringly, redundantly describing her \\"earth-shattering, all-consuming, blahblahblah\\" orgasms. It's ridiculous to the point of being comical...like Ana's maturity level. She refers to her genitals as \\"down there,\\" \\"the muscles deep in my belly,\\" and \\"my sex\\" like she's a 13-year-old who's afraid of the word \\"vagina.\\" (Much like how she refers to Christian's penis, which she never actually refers to directly since most of those sentences are along the lines of \\"he slammed into me.\\" When she does refer to his penis, she refers to it as his \\"possession.\\" Really???) And she has imaginary friend-versions of herself, which is just bizarre and annoying. I skipped all the parts that referred to her \\"inner goddess\\" and \\"subconscious\\" like they're real people. Just say how you feel, for christ's sake!!<br /><br />Christian and Ana, as well as every other character in the book(s), do not behave and interact like normal human beings. The main culprit of this is Christian. Like, he accuses every guy Ana knows of \\"wanting in [her] panties\\" before they even establish a relationship. He flies across the country to see her for a couple hours, because she left to visit her mom for 2 days. He leaves work at the drop of a hat to go antagonize her, several times throughout the series, for several different & trivial reasons. He goes from \\"I'm so mad I wanna beat the s*** out of you\\" to \\"it's ok let's have sex\\"....MANY, MANY TIMES.<br /><br />I feel like this book was written by the guy who directed The Room. In fact, this book would have made more sense if you told me Tommy Wiseau wrote it himself.<br /><br />And did I mention the freaking repetition...and repetition....and repetition...and repetition??? The author has an early high-school-level vocabulary at best, and that's a stretch. At least high-school enough to know how to use a thesaurus, and pick out 5 adjectives to use about a zillion times over to the point that the reader gets sick of them in the first book, even though they're agonizingly overused in ALL THREE. I swear if I ever hear or readthe words \\"surreptitious[ly]\\" or \\"sardonic[ally]\\" ever again, I'm going to punch the person who wrote or said them right in the eye. If I had a dollar for every time one of those two words appeared, I'd have enough money to buy all three books, burn them, and then buy them again. Then there's the overuse of all the actions like gasping, sharp intakes of breath, \\"gazing (usually 'sardonically')\\" at each other, \\"shattering all around him,\\" \\"my blood singing,\\" etc. You'd think with how often these two gasp and pant and \\"mutter/murmur/whisper breathlessly,\\" they'd both be dead from oxygen deprivation.<br /><br />And talk about plot conveniences...everything that happens in these books is completely coincidental (like characters who just happen to already know antagonists that go after other characters, who just happen to already hate them, Ana going to interview Christian because her friend who was supposed to do it just happened to be sick for the first time in ten years on that exact day, Christian showing up and 'saving' Ana from the advances of her drunk friend because he just happened to be looking for her at the time, etc.)<br /><br />Finally, the ending of the series is just about the most predictable thing that has ever happened in human history, and before that, nothing truly exciting or bad happens until almost the end of the third book. So if you're waiting for some misfortune to befall one of the characters and spice up the boring plot (which I was waiting for myself, and it was the only reason I kept reading), I'm sorry to say that you're gonna have to read through a lot of BS to get to it...and then the book's done. There are PLENTY of opportunities for interesting things to happen in the plot, but the author abandons almost every single one in favor of sex (or Christian acting like a loon). In almost every potentially-interesting instance (until the last book), a character is presented with or put in an awkward or dangerous situation, then nothing happens, the offending situation dies down for no reason, then Ana goes home and Christian screws her in redundant detail. I swear, if you took out all the irrelevant, boring sex from each book, you'd only be left with enough pages to still fill the first one.<br /><br />As I said, I really wanted to like these books, and I guess if you took out all the sex, unrealistic behavior, and boring filler (like the in-depth descriptions of the freaking sky, what other characters are wearing, and other things of that nature) it would still make for an interesting love story. Too bad there are already about 500 billion other, better love stories out there.<br /><br />I give it two stars instead of one because the plot had a really good start, and it could have been executed in SO many other, better ways.
B004SEVPWQ|5.0|This is the closest to real pool and also the best snooker pool I ever seen and played.  I just can't believe it's only 99 cents. Anyone who's into pool will regret passing this up. I can spend hours with this app.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|too addictive. I could play for hours without realizing. Now I understand the stress over it. Thank God my baterie dies before I can continue playing
B004X6PRO6|5.0|This novel begs to be re-read.  I read through it so rapidly that I had no time to consider those events/characters that called for immediate re-reading and contemplation.  I had no idea, until late in the novel, where this author was taking me, and that made me rush ever onward.  I know I missed much in such a headlong journey, but it was a most satisfying one that I will happily take again.  This book is more than worthy of the Pulitzer.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best game ever. I highly recommend this game,for all ages. And both good for girls and boys.
B00AB0Z88S|2.0|I know some people consider pop-outs gimmicky, preferring unobtrusive 3D. They talk about how enhanced depth is all they want. Well, 2D already has depth, otherwise it would be unwatchable. As far as I'm concerned if things aren't popping out of the screen then 3D is absolutely pointless. The pop-out is, after all, the 3rd dimension.<br /><br />There was virtually no 3D in this film as far as I could tell. Just look at the cover image. How great would it have been to have that giant whale pop out of the screen and into your living room? How about water rushing toward you? Or your living room seemingly engulfed in waves with mist all around? That's what I was expecting when I purchased this film. But none of that was to be found. It's a 2D film packaged as 3D in my opinion. What's the point of wearing clunky and uncomfortable active shutter glasses and putting up with an inferior image if you're not going to get the pop-out payoff?<br /><br />My 2 star rating wasn't just for the lack of any discernible 3D. Let me put it this way, I probably will never watch this movie again. I just wasn't transported by it. 2 hours spent on the ocean with one character and a tiger were a bit much.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was a fun read and is now one of my favorite books of all time. I highly recommended this book.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game!  Fun but makes you think.  It keeps the mind fresh. I would recommend.  It is addicting too!  Ready for more rooms.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|MUST BUY BOOK.  This book is challenging and all should read it.  You will be inspired by what you read.
B00ABXA1HI|4.0|Works great on local lan, even with games. Games and movies over internet connections are better than others I have tried, but still a bit of lag. Easy to use, nice GUI, great app all things considered.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|As always, lots of information on law but interesting. The twist and turns in the story keep you interested. Good book to read on rainy weekend.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This app is very entertaining, I like it better than Candy Crush. It is seriously addicting and makes you think. I like to challenge myself into getting a star the first time around with no mistakes. It is harder than you think! Enjoy!!
B009X01D9U|3.0|I bought this case over a year ago and I've been satisfied with it UNTIL NOW. HOWEVER I've recently noticed that the plastic corner clips which lock the Kindle into the case were cracking, and now one of the corner clips has broken off. I take reasonably good care with my Kindle, so I don't believe I can be accused of abusing the case. The clips probably developed stress cracks because they do grip the device pretty firmly, which to me means inadequate product design. Considering the current price (price was a lot less when I bought mine), I would not recommend this as a long-term investment (but who keeps there gadgets long-term anyway). I also agree with other reviewers that this cover does not hold the device in upright positions very securely.
B009JZSC9S|4.0|interesting legal scheme. each story can hold its own. only the individual characters' lives hold the series together, which is a good thing, therefore you feel as if you haven't been ripped out of the middle, yet are curious enough to see the next. story line is usually interesting enough that you can'y guess everything ahead of time.
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|Wonderful story retold.  The acting was very good as well as costuming and scenery :)<br />Would recommend viewing Gatsby .
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|Interesting story,but not spell-binding. Characters kind of stretch to believe. I do not like the idea that reviews need to be a certain number of words
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game is very pleasant to play the first 10 - 12 levels, however it gets quickly frustrating afterwards, and having only 5 lives (tries) for a hard level (I am still stuck on 13) before having to wait 30 min for each additional try (life) becomes old really fast.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|I have read a number of stories in the Pendergast series and find them all unusual and yet enjoyable. Certainly far fetched, but interestingly twisted in plot. In this one, the characters are well developed and their stories are strange, bringing a brooding quality to the tale. Sometimes the plot gets a bit convoluted and confusing, but in the end it is brought together well. Some detail could be better edited.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Good story, loved the mystery, characters were believable. Down side to many  &#34;f&#34; bombs.  Would have given 5 stars if the language was not so strong.
B009NF54ZE|4.0|An enjoyable game with great graphics. Entertaining puzzle games. Could benefit from pan and zoom feature. I had difficulty seeing some of the objects as they were extremely small. Overall a good game.
B00932AA5G|5.0|Loved the book and now love the movie.  The captions were not distracting.  Very well cast and story has a certain fascination with double entendre.  Better than I expected, given the difficulty of making a foreign movie interesting as well as preserving the various suspenseful plot twists in the native language of the book.
B0084670FU|5.0|I like it because it could happen, probably has happened, daily (different circumstances, of course).  The film is long, but good.
B005FMZWD8|2.0|Does Invicta make 1513's with right side dials? Very nice looking watch but I would prefer it with right side dials.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Great game. Love it. It is so interesting. If any of my friends like this types of games I would recommend this game.
0399157573|3.0|Glad to see Cornwell getting back on her game, but she's not back to those earlier stories that were so gripping. Too much &#34;junk&#34; that was not an addition to characters or interactions and way more background stuff than needed.<br /><br />I am pulling for Cornwell to get back to those stories that kept me glued to the books until finished. I'm not there but will keep reading her work with the hope that she will get the groove back.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|As with all the books there is so much detail that you have your own movie in your mind. The saga goes on and what twist in the plot will come next.
1853261580|5.0|Read this once in french and it is wonderful to revisit the classic childrens book. The book teaches a great lesson
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book is excellent.  It is well-written; the characters are great, and even though it is technically a young adult novel, it is very appropriate for adults as well. It's one of the best books I've read in the last several years.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I really enjoyed Doctor Sleep. This is partially to do with how much care and love King put into making Danny a fully realized flesh and blood character. It is his heart and soul that drives this story.<br /><br />The plot of vampires that he squares off against is never bad just in my humble opinion didn't really hit all the way.<br /><br />I would recommend this to any King fan. Or anyone wanting to reconnect with their old friend Danny.
B003U4UNPK|4.0|Lo<br />There is never a dull moment, the show has more twists and turns then a roller coaster always leaving you with I want more
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Beautiful graphics but takes forever to do things unless you actually spend money. My daughter loves it though and she is three
0812973992|2.0|No doubt this novel is well-written but perhaps that's just the trouble with it.  The author seems bent on writing somethng beautiful and profound and misses the basics like character development, for example.  The whole time I'm reading about characters that I just don't care about!  Why?  Because I don't know them.  Each vignette is told iusing a first person narrative, and in two of the three vignettes the character telling the story is so self-absorbed that the characters around them lack substance.  In the first part, with the catholic priest, it's the opposite problem.  The priest's brother tells the story of his eccentric Mother Theresa-type sibling who takes over the story to the point that the narrator remains flat and two-dimensional on the page.  His (the narrator's) behavior is unexplainable and unpredictable because the reader doesn't know him and therefore doesn't know what to expect.  Colum McCann should take heed from such wonderful novels as The Great Gasby or Netherland by joseph O'Neill both of which use a first-person narrative to develop the main character of the novel.  However in both of these works those described and those describing are equally-well developed.
B000W9399S|4.0|This is a fine book. I can't say the plot kept me up at night or anything. It is just fun. I am told that the series gets better. I hope that is true. Even though I did enjoy the book I did find myself having to get back to this book. It sometimes felt like a chore. When I would read it I would laugh and have a good time.<br /><br />The major problem that exist is that the characters and the plot just aren't that interesting. Still a good read that I would recommend.
B00AWKZSNM|3.0|I purchased this product with the intention to be able to move my pictures from my compact flash cards to an external hard drive during my trip. This way, I can avoid bringing my macbook pro and instead just bring an iPad. After numerous experiments, I find out that the whole process to initiate file transfer from one location to another is really straight forward when using the free app which can be downloaded from app store.<br /><br />Here is how I attempted to use this device: iUSBPort -> passive USB Hub -> 1. External Portable Hard drive 2. Compact Flash card reader. Using the app on my iPhone, I attempted to transfer an entire folder from my Compact flash card (which contains .CR2 images instead of .JPG) directly to the external portable hard drive. The apps shows that the files are being transferred successfully. However, when I look at the results on the external hard drive, not only has the .jpg extension been added to the name (eg. DSA98304.cr2 becomes DSA98304.cr2.jpg), but the file size is also completely wrong. This causes the transferred files to be unusable. I also tried a movie file (mp4) but this time from the hard drive -> compact flash. After the app shows transfer is finished, I checked the transferred file and sure enough it is not transferred completely (received ~240MB instead of ~370MB).<br /><br />Further experiment shows that the issue is really because of the iUSBport cannot provide enough current to maintain proper connection between the compact flash reader and the external hard drive. This is a deal breaker for me as I cannot really use a powered USB hub when I am out on the field. The only way I can back up my CF cards is to only have the CF card reader connected to the iUSBPort and transfer them to the iPad and then disconnect my CF reader and replace it with the external HD and then transfer the files from iPad to the hard drive. There is still a caveat  with this method which is the .jpg extension being added to the file names. Youwill not be able to validate if the pictures show up correctly. But based on the file size shown, they appear to be identical and when I removed the .jpg addition, the transferred file shows up correctly. But I do not know if I would do this when I am out on the field (expedition) as it is really risky and takes a lot of time.<br /><br />On the other end, if you are only trying to find a way to extend your portable device storage, this device works really well. I tried playing a 1080p movie (3.8GB) stored on the external HD on the iPad, the streaming was great. The video plays really well without any stutters and jumping around in the movie to different time is also instantaneous as if the files were playing on your local memory.<br /><br />To summary, this product does what it is intended to do which is to provide an extension storage for any of your portable device through ad-hoc wireless connection. However, if you are thinking of using this to back up your camera storage (in my case, compact flash cards) to an external hard drive, be prepared to transfer from compact flash -> portable device (ipad, iphone, etc) and then portable device -> compact flash.
B004LROMSO|4.0|Movie played well. I have only played disc 1 of 3. There are scratches on the back of them so I was worried about how they would play. So far so good. If you like Jamie Campbell Bower then you would enjoy this TV series. I was surprised by all the sexual scenes and bad language in it, esp. since the scenes were from the King Arthur era where those words weren't thought about yet. I do however love that time period so I am really enjoying this 1st and only season. Seller sent the package fast.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I happen to like this game very much it is so fun you should buy it to play when your bord
B003XF1OJK|5.0|I like most who are bothering to read the review of Halo: The Fall of Reach have played and loved the games. When you purchase a book like this you are trading off. You get an instant fimiliar setting and characters that are already defined in your head. The trade off is that almost nothing major can happen to most of the characters becuase they will need to be in the main source material. In this case the games. Having said that this is one of the best Expanded Universe type novels I have ever read.<br /><br />The story of Master Chiefs childhood is spot on with what we have come to know about him. The characterazation of Keyes was the real suprise to me. The plot won't blow you away with surprises but I don't think it needs to. This book does everything right that it set out to do.
B005TPCQ5I|1.0|This movie left me with such a sad feeling.  I was not expecting such a tragic scene.  I wish I had not watched it.
B00D6QU6RW|5.0|Have enjoyed playing this CD of my fave boy band, BSB. CD played well. Good to hear new hits, although I like the old ones better. Hopefully they'll make another CD in the future. Seller sent the product fast. Product and seller recommended!

B008602KQI|4.0|The movie itself was really good, but the future it depicts is so dark that I can't give it a full 5 stars.  I like happy movies the best
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loooooooovvvvvvveeeeed it!!!! I would definitely recommend this book to anyone. It has been such a fantastic read. Couldn't put it down.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|The my little pony app is fun cute, and accurate towards the show. It has every character, every shop, and now even has Canterlot. I give it 5 incredible stars.
0307719227|2.0|Although I do not agree with all the conclusions of this book, I haven’t the slightest doubt that in Mexico we need to build open institutions and put an end to the extractive institutions that have done us so much harm. A good energy reform would only be a first step in this direction. - See more at: [...]
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun... but hate getting stuck on a level!  I wish there were more options to earn extras to get me thru a level.
B00008MJ8H|4.0|I am a big fan of the Sergio Leone's movie and even bigger fan of Ennio Morricone's movie scores. This is the best ever work from the master composer.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|I have Terraria on the PC and on my kindle fire. It is one of the best games ever. Terraria is a 2-D Minecraft. I love it.
0596522347|4.0|In her book, Nancy Duarte writes that a presentation is often the last impression a client gets before closing a deal. How is it possible that businesses spend millions of dollars on an ad campaign and at the same time are totally indifferent to working up a good presentation?  This is what her book is all about: advice and practical tools to develop good visual presentations. - See more at: [...]
B00EV6T6DQ|5.0|Cannot wait to see the movie!!! Love doesn't involve anything but love, gender doesn't even matter! A wonderful story about true love
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book inspires me, and it's just a perfect book. It's just a special story that is well written by the author!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|this is a fun game to play. it does get frustrating when you cannot win a level without buying extra powers but usually you can do it if you just persist.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Works great.  I carry it in my pocket any time I am working where I might need to touch up the edge on my knife.
B004SIP8JI|2.0|I think it was just my copy and I didn't bother trying to return it. But the voices didn't sync with the action on the director's cut. Loved the movie itself though
B00FKAA3MA|3.0|The original MMLP is a classic.  A twisted introduction into the personal side of Marshall Mathers.  An album that really tells a story you want to listen to.  One of my personal favorites.  But this new album.....lets just say its no MMLP.  Its ok in its own right but defenetly not deserving of the MMLP moniker.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|okay<br />this is good book for the desert cranes dug pop bun minutes driest chain Guv Eric Dec feeding Rubin
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|I hate the fact that I'm stuck on a level because I don't have a Facebook and don't want to spend money. I thought this game was supposed to be free?
B00GIXWXEO|5.0|I wasn't sure about this little movie. My kids didn't seem interested when they saw the preview at the theater. Then yesterday they were bored and we saw it was available. I showed them the preview and they said ok let's try it. Well I am so glad they did. They sat quietly and watched the whole thing. At ages 4 and 7 sometimes it is hard to find a movie they both like. One is a boy the other a girl, so that makes things even more difficult. This one is good for both boys and girls, and held both of their interest. Good news is they are watching it again today. That means I truly got my moneys worth.
B009CVRQLY|1.0|What a snore fest. She does not have the greatness of say a Streisand to stay away so long and expect anyone to care. Celine seems so over. There is also a hoarseness and rasp that has come way too soon for a young singer. Back to Vegas Celine. Sorry
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This game is very awesome and I love it. You should get this game. I love it and I think you should give it a five star rating.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It is fun and slightly addicting despite its  cuteness . It gets more challenging as you progress. surprisingly amused with it.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Grisham has a reputation as a wonderful story teller.  He has done nothing but enhance it.<br />I enjoyed it very much.  If you liked the others, then you will not be disappointed.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This is a fun game to me! But however this game is not for everyone! I've had friends play it and.they went &quot;AHH&quot; but I don't care I love it! Great game
B008LXZFH6|2.0|We just didn't like it at all.<br />This was not our type of comedy at all, still not a huge Will Ferrell fan.
B007SY3CEW|5.0|I love it! I know nothing about piano but fun to play different songs. And yes I like that it shows which keys to press. I think it is fun and certainly helps with learning the song. Practice makes perfect. It allows for the beginner and expert to enjoy playing different songs.<br /><br /> It plays the full song for easy listening if you just want to hear the song .Increase the tempo , change the pitch of the song, the note length, hear the other hand playing (accompaniment). So Cool!<br /><br />I downloaded to my Samsung galaxy note 3 and it works Wonderfully - Nice tone, and volume controls great.  I am looking forward to playing a song over my phone at Thanksgiving.  Now if I can just keep my husband from wanting to use it all the time. *(hehehe)
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|bloon popping dart throwing action jaw dropping towers amazing maps and special agents you should get this game my favorite td game
B00F0N7JUG|5.0|Awesome!! Best thing I've ever seen in my entire life. Never seen a better movie. Don't actually have a blu-ray player, but the dvd is great!!
B0034G4P80|5.0|Hello, it is Thor. It is part of Marvel's Phase 1. It is a good story and Asgard is stunning. I was a little disappointed in the Warriors Three, but Loki more than made up for it.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Purchased a set of lives.  Never got them but it did take my 99 coins for them...how do I get them????
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I enjoy playing this game. I used to play all the time on Facebook, this is a great way to relax after work.
0064400557|5.0|Thought I already had copy but couldn't find it so ouch asked this one.  My daughter absolutely loved this classic.  I will be holding on to this copy for a long time.
B00EI2Y4MQ|4.0|Basic calculator plus &#34;tape&#34;. No issues seen.  Like the ability to scroll the history window back to verify the entries.
B002RVZV9K|5.0|It was highly recommended by a friend and I thoroughly agree. Jimmie Page and the Edge are the best in the world
B003VANOFY|3.0|When I ordered this I wondered how it would do with Linux, since many reviews talk about it depending on the Windows drivers.  But when I plugged it into my laptop running Fedora 19, it worked right out of the box: I only had to open the sound control panel and switch output to the G930 device.  The volume knob on the headset controls the volume, and the G-keys map to Next, Play/Pause, and Prev without me needing to do anything.  Note that using the headset on Windows and then moving it to Linux confuses the mapping of the keys and volume knob, but simply turning the headset off and on again is enough to make it work properly under Linux again.<br /><br />I've been very happy with the sound from the headset, but I just tried using the microphone for recording, and was very disappointed with the quality.  It seems that the the microphone sampling rate is limited to 16000 Hz (which Windows calls \\"Tape Recorder Quality\\") in order to reserve wireless bandwidth for the surround sound, even if surround sound is turned off.
0312383347|5.0|A really great book. I love this author. She writes books that are really a lot of fun to read.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Pocket sized, does the job and value for money. Let's face it, the best knife in the world is useless if it is dull so a sharpener is a must. Not everyone can (or should) take a Tormec with them to sharpen their knife when it gets dull but this is the next best thing. I'm not suggesting the results will be the same, but the convenience this tool brings is worth the trouble and cost. This does a great job of keeping your knives sharp between visits to the whetstone  and well worth the price.
B00D6DVSAE|5.0|Classic Sting ballads. This is his finest album to date that I have experienced. I love his very distinctive voice. Great service from Amazon too
0767919408|5.0|Great book - tough to put down- gives a good insight into the happenings of 1927 with a liitle known behind the scenes view.  Bryson holds your interest from page to page and topic to topic.
B00005RDRO|5.0|This movie is a lot of fun to watch. I saw it as a kid and had to order it. You will never guess the ending.
B00FAOXBKC|5.0|Fits iphone 5 perfectly.  I couldn't decide on color, so chose white and couldn't be happier.  A sleek, clean look and the leather quality is great.  I do really like the tab mechanism which releases the phone--it just doesn't make for a very quick movement (i.e. if you're in a rush to check your phone or take a pic).
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book a lot!!!! It had action and it had lots of fun parts. This is a really good book!!!!
B00BAXFJ5M|5.0|Another great book by Baldacci.  I wish more author's copied his style.  You do not need sex and vulgar words to write a great book , and Baldacci does just that.  I have read ALL of his books.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|My husband loved this book. It really added to some of the information that he already had and helped give him better understanding.
B0064BCNA4|5.0|This a great app for me to practice a few notes of a song when I'm not around a piano.
B00FCR3JQS|5.0|Loved this book! Such insight into to variety and diversity that I love about people. A great reminder that everyone has a unique story, and their perspective is worth sharing. The photographs provide a window into that brief moment that they shared with the photographer. Excellent!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is easilly one of my favorite books. Its a great story that had me on the edge of my seat throughout. God bless these brave men for the amazing job they did. Amazing firsthand account of the mission to capture Bin Laden.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|I'd been hoping for a &#34;proper novel&#34; from Gaiman. Something in line with American Gods or Neverwhere. Well this is in line with those and if it feels more like a fable or fairy tale that's only more proof of the author's skill to enchant and captivate his audience providing something different from, always as good as, and usually better then they expected.  Not much use as a review to throw around words like 'gentle' and 'moving,' though there as apt as 'thrilling' and 'scary'. Put me in mind of Susan Cooper which as the highest praise for a book of this sort I can offer.
B0086700CM|5.0|I think temple run is a good game for all ages. I play it every chance I get at get home school school bus vacashon everywhere.I think you should get temple run this second
B00008H2LB|4.0|I like this album. It is one of the  good albums from Linkin Park. My favorite songs from the album is Numb and Nobody's Listening.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love the kindle app!  The app makes it easy to read books on my smartphone!!  Easy to use. best app on my smartphone.
B00FPH6AXE|5.0|I like the action.  So many films try and fail with action based scripts.  This one definitely succeeded.  I like that Will Smith and his son work together like they do.  Very good Father and Son chemistry.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is really fun it is really exciting and the only thing that bothers me is you have to pay for certain things with real money and my dad doesn't let me buy things so other than that I could spend all day playing this
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|Can't really ever go wrong with a Denzel flick. John Goodman was funny as hell for the little bit he was in the movie.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|The entire book was mesmerizing. A modern-day Dickensian tale. Description and characterization second to none. I had to set an alarm to make sure I didn't spend all night reading this book.
B00G32QIEG|3.0|Funny.  Less action than I like.  Could have been a lot better.  Seemed a little on the short side as far a time goes.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|This is a great app with great graphic and interaction,  but some of the quests can be a pain. Due to the amount of coins or acorn requirements for some of the early quests, it's impossible to get them done without having to spend cash or just let the quests sit there until you have enough acorn or cash to accomplish just 1/10 if not more!
B004VMUS9G|3.0|this is a nice alarm clock but it wilould wast some of your batery but besides that it was nice
B001KZVQJI|5.0|This is by far my favorite version of the King Kong story . Although, they could have done without the corney production before Kong appears on stage in New York .  I bought this to up-date my dvd collection to Blu-Ray .  I wasn't disapointed, and you won't be either.  The difference in the sound effects was unbelievable .  AND,  the price was right.
1449433251|5.0|This is a great collection! Anyone who is a fan of Calvin and Hobbes will love it. The books are just beautiful and really show off Bill Watterson's artwork. I'm got the paperback edition and I'm very happy with it. The books have a protective cover and I think with proper handling they will last a very long time. I would not recommend this collection for your average child, these are beautiful books and deserve special handling.
0385349947|2.0|This is marketed as a feminist manifesto. But it's not. This is just another book about how mothers should have special rights. The author's pep talk on p. 168 is typical:<br />&#34;We all want to feel the same thing: to feel comfortable with our choices and to feel validated by those around us. So let's start by validating one another. Mothers who work outside the home should regard mothers who work inside the home as real workers. And mothers who work inside the home should be equally respectful of those choosing another option.&#34;<br />Aw, isn't that sweet? Mothers can validate mothers and women who aren't mothers can....oops. Apparently they're on their own. Well, there are a few acknowledgements of non-mothers. But most of the focus is clearly on mothers--and women who want to be mothers. An example: On p. 132 the author expresses empathy for a woman who wants to leave work early to go to a party--so that she, too, can hope someday to join Ms. Sandberg's universe of &#34;complete&#34; women who have found their man and can take time off work to attend their offspring's soccer games. Gee, how inclusive of Ms. Sandberg.<br />As a feminist who, unlike Ms. Sandberg, never was ashamed of the title, I have to say that I'm really tired of feminism being co-opted by mothers who believe that it's everyone else's responsibility to chip in to accommodate them. Sorry, but until &#34;feminists&#34; like Ms. Sandberg acknowledge the validity of a broader range of women's choices (and men's choices too, for that matter) beyond those pertaining to parenthood, it should be pointed out that what she's advocating is not that women should have rights equal to men but that mothers should have special rights. That's not gender equality. That's entitlement.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is a lot of fun but there could be more updates to make it better it is fun nice hod hit and score
B000FC1AOI|5.0|Love the book and hate the movie! For anyone dealing with a loss. I've read it more than once and cried each time.
B009LDD4V4|5.0|always good, especially when you want to watch it without commercials,  Not sure how much longer it will run but, I know have them all except current one.
B005V2S7FW|5.0|LastPass was recommended to me in late 2012 by a security trainer.  His recommendation turns out to be prescient; several websites were hacked and password data lost in 2013.  I can no longer afford to have one or a few passwords for all the sites I have logins for.  Instead, I use this to make one unique password per site, so when sites do lose data I can contain the damage I suffer.<br /><br />Also, you should be using two-factor authentication by now - LastPass and Google are offering that now.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This game is amazing. It is rather accurate to what would happen in real life. It has some flaws, such as research is done on non lethal bacteria every day and one Stan of bacteria would mutate not the same bacteria throughout the world but the concept is good. I have studied biological weapons for years and this is honestly the best tool for figureing out how to make it all work. Keep up the good work.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|It's kind of slow but I really liked it.  Was surprised I cried more than once.  A good read for any age.
B00DSLZCR4|4.0|I have followed Allie's blog for some time now and was eager to buy this book when it was released. In terms of content, it did not disappoint. It had enough stories, both familiar and new, to justify the price. Her insights into (for example) her mind, personal mechanisms of depression and humorous childhood tales were enlightening, relateable and by turns touching or hilarious.<br /><br />However, I felt that the quality of the scans in the Kindle edition were lacking; it was very difficult to make out smaller details in the drawings as the reduction was really only appropriate for viewing at standard size and not for zooming. This was enough of a let-down to be irritating at times.<br /><br />Otherwise, however, it was very enjoyable and worth the purchase.
B008602KQI|5.0|Great movie, although I like the book better. Still worth watching to visualize the book. I also really liked the characters.
B006LRUVUA|5.0|Love how I can connect to any of my computers from anywhere (as long as I have an internet connection).
B002OMZTSU|4.0|Candid and funny, a good airline read! Craig is candid about his drug and alcohol problems but manages to put a nice spin on the virtues of recovery.
B004TMPJP6|5.0|This is amazing. You can make lists and organize them neatly and quickly. I also like the fact that you can connect it with your facebook or tootle account. This is a great app overall. I really recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good notetaking/to-do list application
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|A fairly boring version of the &#34;jewel quest&#34; game, and unless you pay, the time limit on game play makes advancement past the first few levels unrealistic. It's much more fun to play the free jewel-Qwest games that don't have these restrictions. That said, it seems like it could be fun, just not interesting/unique enough to pay for.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Lets me right down my thoughts and ideas wherever I am. Love how i can change the colors and helps me keep some ideas when I least expect it.
067144901X|5.0|A classic Boynton, we read this in a sing-song voice and my daughter loves it! We have been reading this since my daughter was 6 months and she is now going on 3, still loves it!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen King is a shining example.<br />Anyway. Dr. Sleep is a deeply moving story, thrilling and sensitive, outlandish but told so well it seems like truth. I've enjoyed reading Stephen King's novels since well before I was old enough, so I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this to anyone who's capable of reading it. The horror is all in your imagination.
B00594XOZU|5.0|When I first got kik I was having a bot of trouble but I have 16 friends on it I am so happy
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I love Feedly, it delivers all the information and updates I want from all my favorite sites. I like how fast and simple it is.
B00BBW15R8|5.0|This is a beautiful movie. I've watched it three times in the six months since I purchased it. My philosophy teacher was worried it was a depressing movie because, apparently, most European movies are depressing, according to him; that is not the case with this movie. In turns hilarious and heart-breaking, this movie is over all inspiring. I love it.
1449305172|5.0|This is a must read for every entrepreneur. It gives really clear insights about lean methodologies and about how to startup any startup.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This was an enjoyable book.  I found it a bit difficult to keep up with all of the characters, but I thought he did a good job of bringing the main ones to life.  It got my attention early on and I couldn't put it down.  Lots of twists and turns.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Works just like it says it does and allows me to access parts of the kindle that I cant access any other way.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|I loved this movie long before there were VCRs, DVDs, and DVRs.  They used to show it on the Dialing for Dollars afternoon movie at Christmastime.  Great story, actors are wonderfully cast and Natalie Wood - has there ever been a cuter kid?
B001JP5JRY|5.0|I bought this to give me some entertainment while i was on trains and what not in when i was traveling europe. It did the job, kept me entertained.<br /><br />Quick read. I often caught myself reading in his voice.. which would bring additional joy to the jokes behind the pages.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|The dialect was a little hard to read at times, but I really enjoyed the story and most importantly, the happy ending!
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Helps me find which wi-fi is better to use for my kindle and other wireless devices. It works just as described.
B00G21XNKU|5.0|It was great seeing David Tenant again.  I also enjoyed the one off drama that depicted the beginning of the series.
B00F8LPH90|5.0|This is literally a great game to pass time with on the bus or at work or really anywhere I would gladly pay the $0.99 again to play an updated version 2.
B002MFULQO|5.0|Clear point of view of JFK assasination. Makes you re-THINK. Oliver has always been the one producer to stand out and stand up for the ppl.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I love this, First of all you dont need the font stuff, So dont worry about that. This allows me to use it and type up documents on the go.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|It is a really fun game and I like to play it a lot. It is my new favorite app
006202406X|1.0|There are no words. Not even finishing the book. Just wow...disappointed. Did not find the story I was set up for with the other two books.
B002SYXCVK|5.0|The collection has a nice variety of Christmas Hymns - most of which are not very common. Besides, I like Sting's music very much.
B007SOQBCM|3.0|This app is ok, It really does need to be updated so that you can access the actual site and sign in to your account.
B00GFOIUVQ|3.0|All though the gameplay is fun the content is worthless. Gameloft has created a game where you will not get away with spending less than $100 dollars if you want to unlock everything. You would need to play through levels over and over again to get the points to buy the other outfits and you have to spend real money on new weapons.<br />Now if they offered a $30 version of the game where you could play to unlock items normally, it would be worth the money.
B0049J3QNG|5.0|Great Sequel... The fun doesn't stop with the characters. My daughter enjoys all three, but loves Jessie! One you can watch over and over!
B004GYY714|5.0|It seems pretty amazing.  Just wish I'd thought to get it before.  Simple to download - just follow the instructions on line.
B000EHSVOG|5.0|Many great actors in this one. The story line is good but much the same for all movies of this type. Greed leads to disaster. The picture is very good as is the sound. Fun to watch.
B00DYEN5QU|5.0|I'm a big Superman fan and happy to have a different version of Superman hit the big screen. Better than Superman returns but Superman the movie with Cristopher Reeve will always be my personal favorite.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|Completely loved it! If you watch in in one sit-in it feels long! but is definitely worth it. Beautiful story from Jane Austen. Mr. Knightley (Johnny Lee Miller) definitely captured my heart. :)
B0002IQNAG|5.0|I got exactly what I wanted. This is a great movie, possibly my favorite of the George Romero Dead films. I remember watching it 8 years ago, and now after revisiting it, its even better than I remember.
B000VK99Z6|1.0|Bah,  the series gets better after the first movie.  Not that the some scene aren't rememberable, but the story as a whole is not to my taste.  An English freind tells me that the movie really nails the typical small English town or village(?).
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Lots of twists and turns. Overall this book covers areas from the law to a family to life in the deep south. Also it makes the reader think about how much has changed since the eighties in regard to race relations. Best book I have read in a while!
B00APUQH0W|5.0|Excellent film.  Great narrative and strong cast.  At moments one can lose patience with the film but overall the movie is worth your time.
B000001E29|4.0|It's signature Tom Waits sound in an unconventional approach to a play. Love it all and makes you appreciate his post Swordfishtrombones material even more.
0399161287|5.0|I was exposed to boxing from a very early age and came to recognize, if not to fully understand, the complexities and contradictions so many fighters uniquely share. Whether it's LaMotta's deep, self-destructive insecurities, Ali's determination not to be defined by others or Tyson's profound need for love and understanding, what they and most other prizefighters have in common is that their greatest battles occurred outside the strands.  I've always believed that boxers (and boxing) owe their popularity to the fact that for so many ardent fans prizefighters represent greatly magnified versions of our own lives, the struggles, the long odds, the enemies within and without, the need for resiliency and courage, and the never-ending demand that we \\"answer the bell.\\"  Mike Tyson has faced his demons, and done so naked to the world.  Amid the profanity and pain, the hilarity and anger, the fear and courage, Mike has given us a book that should be honored, celebrated and shared.  If the jury and those who vote have half the courage of Mike, this book should be on a very short list for the Pulitzer Prize.  I defy anyone to name a nonfiction book from this or any other year that holds as much humanity, raw insight and Undisputed Truth between its front and back covers, or within its digital content.
0395389496|5.0|Nothing like a real hardback book. I can't wait to read this to my grand children on this Christmas Eve.
B000GLNBH2|5.0|If you are and architect in the line of Frank Lloyd Wright, you will especially like this book. It is a tribute to their creativity.
B00F0N7JUG|3.0|While the movie is fantastic and special features are as well I was disappointed with how misleading the photograph was of the special case. Sorely disappointed.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I couldn't wait to find out what was going to happen next.  The point of view of the narrator was brilliant.  The analogies were amazing.  I thought allot about what it must have been like for a young girl growing up in Nazi Germany.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game is so addictive! I have purchased this app on my phone and got it on my kindle. The graphics are amazing and it really feels like you are hunting. I love how you are able to upgrade your weapons as well. I definitely recommend this game.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I played Castleville on Facebook but tired of it because you could only play for a few minutes at a time. I am enjoying this on my Kindle Fire.
0891419063|5.0|Excellent book about the Marines who endured hardships and horrible combat experiences fighting the formidable Japanese.<br />They were subjected to incredible horrors of warfare.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Brightening my day even though parts of the book is sad. The journeys that Hazel, Gus, and Isaac encounter and face are amazing.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|There are so many great truly-free candy games like this, so there is no need to use this greedy-ass game which stops working very quickly unless you feed it money.  Check out Candy Swipe, one of my favs.
B000PAAH3K|3.0|I liked this book, but I got a little lost sometimes and had to go back and reread sections. So it took me a while to get thru it. I enjoyed it.
B006PZBRCY|5.0|Great movie. This film is much deeper than you would expect from watching the previews. The big robots and fighting scenes serve as decent entertainment. However, it's the father and son relationship that makes this movie special.
B002CORN4S|4.0|Love this CD!  I remember when it was a new release.  This was the only tour I did not see Van Hagar on.  Too bad no live cd of this tour.  Great sound quality and they rock on this one.  Great swan song for Sammy.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I really enjoyed the novel the Shining. I always wondered what happened to Danny. I recommend this book to any Stephen King fan. Really enjoyed the ride.
B004W2UBYW|2.0|I am sorry, I know Steve Jobs has passed away and that's unfortunate for those who cared about him. I was not able to really get into this book. I have always been of the opinion that Steve Jobs was arrogant and I never cared for him from the beginning. I got this book to see if perhaps my opinion was not correct, but I just could not get into the book.  From the beginning it appeared my opinion was absolutely correct. I suspect because of that, Walter Isaacson did a good job on the book.  I am respective of the deceased so perhaps I should not speak anymore about this book.
0140282033|5.0|After seeing the charming movie - which is one of my top ten favorite movies of all time - I wanted to read the book upon which it is based.  Although there are some key details that are different, both are appealing in their own way.  And the message they both teach is similar.  Life and spirituality are about joy, not lifeless rules and regiments.  Compassion counts more than catechism.  If you enjoy novels involving transformation and insight gained, this one is a charmer.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Giving it 5 stars because I've always loved this movie. It's hilarious. Not meant for kids though. One of, if not the funniest, Griswold movie.
B00G32QIEG|3.0|So-so movie that was basically Men In Black except swapping dead people for aliens.  I also thought Jeff Bridges' accent was way over the top.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|This is a good work.  It's a difficult subject to write about and keep the reader engaged.  Aslan provided me with answers to some questions I had and he also created more questions.  I rated him 4 stars because in the beginning he said that he had not taken data from religious sources but in several places he uses religious references. I think this is a difficult subject to write about primarily because the data no longer exists or at least is not available.  I also did not like the way he treated the ending. It appeared to me that he was rushing to hurry and finish.  Perhaps that is because there is no finish...no end.  But I didn't care for the ending of simply relating references.  I took history of religion courses in undergraduate school and I salute Aslan for obtaining a Ph.D. in that field. But I encourage him to write more. I actually saw him interviewed on TV about this book which led me to read it.  Overall, he did a good job.
B004UJAOLM|2.0|Bought this because it was a classic I'd never read.<br /><br />Yuck! What a bunch of self-absorbed, whiney twits populate this book! &#34;Me! Me! Me! I want! My desire! Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! I can't be denied ANYTHING! You don't love me enough!&#34;<br /><br />Was that the author's intent? To show the worst of the moneyed English classes? If so the book is a resounding success at showing the absurd, and decidedly repulsive, side of unlimited egos lusting for power, each other and self-aggrandizement.<br /><br />The narrator Lockwood was the only (semi) sane one of the lot. (Okay, the loyal housekeeper was OK.)<br /><br />But this is great literature? I would have tossed this halfway through except for being on a trans-Atlantic flight with limited alternatives for constructively (This was constructive?) spending my time.<br /><br />All I can say is, yes, I read it. What a bunch of losers!
B0034G4P94|5.0|I LOVE YOU TOMMY....I LOVE YOU! Best movie ever. Seriously, if you haven't watched this.....stop reading this and get to it.
B00GSE92F6|5.0|Lol, the wife and kids love watching Dr Who so much, I paid $7.99 for them to watch it on HD .... go figure. They all seem to enjoy it though so $7.99 for an hour and 16 minutes peace and quiet for me to get on the new ps4 ... priceless !!
B001HPP2XW|3.0|I know it's a classic -- I saw it in my youth.  It's a beautifully made film but the Jerry Lewis bits (as a stererotyped Chinese man) is not only completely unnecessary, it is so bigotted, I cringe every time (or even before) Lewis is on the screen.  I'm sure it was due to sheer ignorance at the time but it is just so painful to watch that it ruins the entire film for me.  I wish there was a version of the film with Lewis edited out.  Maybe I could give it 5 stars then.
B007HGPBRC|2.0|Even the most articulate seem unable to make of their dying anything more than an unwelcome inevitable last event that we can only anticipate but not experience.  He was willing to share how it was to live with such a serious illness, and I read the book to the end out of respect for the man and his work. The writing measured against the pain and weakness under which it was written is a masterpiece, but I do not recommend reading it with such expectations. Rather read it in the same spirit of support and kindness you would employ in sitting at the bedside of a dear friend.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|Something's wrong with this game it cheats you put of your coins a lot it shuts down and you don't get them back
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I'm so glad I decided to purchase these films in box set instead of just the individual ones I like. The extra footage around the making of the film, especially the original, was very exciting (and there is A LOT of extra behind-the-scenes info to know about). I also really like the packaging, it's well made and slim enough to fit nicely on any media shelf. As for the movies, 1 & 2 are my favorites (I'm pretty sure I can recite Aliens by heart) but it was more cost effective to have the whole set. And this way I get to give the last two a few more views. There wasn't a behind-the-scenes on the 4th one, which I thought was interesting, but this is a product that delivers and at an amazing sale price for blu-ray!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I absolutely love the minions, and being able to play as one is awesome. This game requires a lot of hand-eye coordination, but if you like Despicable Me 1&amp;2 I recommend trying this game :)
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It's a great app .. Have it on my kindle.. comes in handy when your shopping or doing your check book...download it soon..
B00EVPSJOE|5.0|This is one oft all time favorite albums.. I would recommend it to all. Mary had a little lamb, it's ....
B00BMKH5NW|5.0|I loved it. I loved everything about it. I read it in like 15 minutes! Not really but that's what it felt like. I am a fangirl and I am huge fan of fanfic so when I read this book, not only could I relate but I could relate it to about 15 other people that I know. It's a hysterical and touching story about a character you really come to care about and the characters she really cares about. I was hooked after the first page and I could not put it down. Recommending this big time to all fangirls but ESPECIALLY if you're NOT one! Pull these curtains back and you will find a very fun and well fleshed-out story about a young girl bound for college and what growing up in the &#34;real world&#34; is like - which is a theme everyone will understand and enjoy!
B00B8M4IMK|4.0|Very pleased.  I can charge my iPhone and I pad.  At first I was disappointed as one port says for android but you can charge to apple devices.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book not only keeps you reading but keeps you thinking after the book is finished. What does it take to erase a mortal sin while still on Earth? At what point does enough good make up for a terrible wrong?
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The app is kind of like subway surfers but more fun. It is pretty challenging because all these different objects are being thrown at you! But that's all the fun about it!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love Solitaire! I grew up with it. I do tend to get beat by the game itself but that's me.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is like the most fun game someone has ever invented. It's super easy to play. It is awesome. Thank You for this amazing game
B0091REZMW|5.0|This is a classic HOG. I agree with others that in order to play these games without spending money you need two things: patients and friends. Just started playing again am on level ten and have 3 friends so far. It really is frustrating when trying to move forward in the game without spending money to do so but the upside is gratifying when you do. If you're looking for hours of continuous play start and play a few games simultaneously . This one is challenging and fun without wasting your whole day. That is not what games are for. Don't forget to live. Get out of your house America!
B00ADLCC9I|3.0|As with many tables confusion rules if this is the gamepad 2 it is getting good reviews. Same problem with nexus 7 is it a 1 or two? does it download from google play store ok? would it be ok for a 8 and six year old?
B00CNQ7CRI|3.0|LOVED the 1st Bridget Jones books, but maybe that's because I was single, in my 30's with my 1st TV job, and also like Bridget, worried about dyeing  alone and being eaten by an Alsatian. This one feels a bit forced. But also, My life is now nothing like hers, except for the trying to get myself to write that screenplay part : I'm not 50, and I don't have kids or a boy toy or use Twitter, and she may have lost me on the Mommy humor - though the little girl is my favorite character. And the Twitter stuff feels lengthy. Jonesy's character doesn't feel as 3-D as she did in, especially the 1st book, neither do the other character, really.  But it's a fine light read for the subway commute.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a great game! It makes u wonder and really think how to make certain moves.  Download now and try it
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It does as advertised. You can cast anything you want using your Google Chrome browser. My family loves it. It works great with Netflix and YouTube on your phone or laptop. Great deal.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|The Original!  The Very Best version!  I watch it every year!  Now I'll have it on DVD instead of VCR.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Awesome sequel! Not as scary as the Shining but more satisfying for the soul. Thanks SK for bringing back old friends.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|best game ever once I jumped all the way over a building??!!!!I can change to different people!!!!get this game and. you will be surprised
B00BW7FHJY|2.0|I love Beethoven and his music. Such strife it brings me to deliver so negative a report. To date, I have watched the Ninth through Fifth Symphonies in this series.<br /><br />The music is nice, though certainly not top performances. The sound is totally substandard for Blu-ray format. If this performance were simply released as a 1990 musical collection on audio CD, I would be happy with its contents. As a modern audio/visual presentation, however, it is very disappointing.<br /><br />During the Ninth Symphony in particular, my impression was that the musicians were instructed to over-act for its filming, perhaps to somehow make the performance more intensively dynamic or visually appealing. But, it doesn't; it just detracts from their collective talent and composure. Instead of playing as a united body, it almost appears as though each musician is attempting a solo - it just looks absolutely silly. I'm all about playing Beethoven with passion and fire, but really. . .this is just a sad attempt at something which merely results in undesirable annoyance.<br /><br />Although he's no gem to look at on any day (then again, neither was Beethoven), Maestro Abbado basically looks like a zombie who hasn't slept in three days, especially during the Ninth! In fact, the entire orchestra pretty much resembles a ragtag band who partied all night, crawled out of bed, tossed on their suits and jumped on stage just a moment prior to show. During the Ode to Joy, even the soloist are mediocre, at best, in their performance.<br /><br />I have never seen a performance of Beethoven's beloved Ninth Symphony where a good twenty-five percent of the seats were left empty, yet in this concert, they are. Alas, the audience looks like a bunch of impoverished riffraff who were randomly pulled off the street, coerced to attend, and grudgingly sat through a masterpiece about which they knew absolutely nothing! The other symphonies, so far, are much better as the performers appear rested and theaudience well perceptive to their environment. The Ninth is just terrible!<br /><br />This performance (of the 9th) does not give credit to the music! For that reason alone (though there are many others), it is my opinion that this collection is not worth owning. I would rather check-out a 1970's version from the local library, watch a random performance on the Internet, or simply visit my neighborhood High School orchestra than to watch this poor rendition of the Master's music! Nothing against the higher-praising reviewers, but if you've grown to enjoy high quality Beethoven recordings, don't waste your money on this set. It will only prove regrettable.<br /><br />As at least one other reviewer kindly noted, the overall composition and maintenance of the camera angles is quite inferior. Well, that was a polite way of stating that the general cinematography of this concert series sucks! My observation is that everything relating to choreographing, cropping and framing of these concert videos was very poorly engineered and subsequently executed by the directors of photography, camera operators and the film crew. To make matters even less bearable, these videos were clearly filmed in the normal (outdated) 4:3 television aspect ratio, and then basically zoomed-in to accommodate wide screen monitors and modern displays. Effort was taken to neither enhance the quality of the image resolution nor remaster the proportional relationship of the original recordings. This is just a set of old-school, standard version DVDs which were very cheaply and carelessly converted to Blu-ray format in an attempt to attract (or may I suggest lure) the modern buyer. A younger, tech-savvy purchaser should be aware of this complete lack of quality.
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|So far so good. Nice speeds. Satisfied. I just wish it had a longer cord since I use it on my desktop.
B008Y5T5ZE|5.0|The music is awesome and perfect for this movie. Depp plays his role well as does Langella. Eerie yet a thriller. You find out what happens to you when you mess with the wrong book!!!!

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Best purchase ever! So useful. Once all the subtle bugs ironed out by Google, this might end up becoming the most useful product ever. Waiting for other video applications to support this. Especially TED talks app.
B000QGAU4E|5.0|This is one of the best &#34;sci-fi&#34; (hate to call it that) films ever. I really don't know why it didn't win an oscar. The post-apocalyptic theme and storyline are excellent, and the cinematography is some of the best I've ever seen. We're talking 6 minute intense actions scenes done on one take.
1616550414|5.0|When I first saw this book I immediately thought &#34;Shut up and take my money&#34;. And I gotta tell you it was really worth it. The book is amazing, it has everything you need to know about the saga and the quality is great. If you're a Legend of Zelda fan, you're gonna love it.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Great book.Loved it. you will read this book from start to finish without stopping.And love every minute.I want more books from Liane Moriarty.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Read this book in two days. I absolutely could not put it down. The story keeps getting better and leaves you in suspense.
B006PERRMY|4.0|This is a good movie.  Really a unique twist on what could very well come true. Rather than money, the economy ran on how much time you could make working, or getting by whatever means.  The time is stored in your body.  When you run out, you die.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Candy Crush Saga<br />I have only played a few levels of candy crush. After playing more the level may change
B00BHWG3GU|5.0|I bought Songbook for my wife, and she keeps the CD in her car. I like Allen Toussaint's  music, too.
0071771263|2.0|i like the previous editions better because it simulated the actual test. This edition I cannot study and practice the practice tests as if I am taking the actual test.
B00DHRLK84|4.0|Entertaining popcorn type movie. I've always loved zombies in general, so that bumps this up a little for me. Arrived quick, no playback issues, good packing. I didn't expect much from this movie because of all the production problems I had read about it running into. Maybe that low expectation contributed to my enjoyment of the film, but I would recommend it for a decent action movie that throws brad pitt in with zombies
B004OA6KIS|5.0|This book is more than just exciting. It is wondrous for a non-scientific reader like me. I love science but never learned the math. Having science, from physics to zoology, set out in layman's terms, by someone as excited about it as Richard Feynman, has been a joy.  His insights into science as a whole, NASA, and bureaucracy in general, are keen and informative.  Great book. Every thinking citizen should read this book
1936594234|5.0|This is a classic book, which I highly recommend. It demonstrates the power of the subconscious mind, which can be used by any person for success and abundance if used properly. Unfortunately, millions of people unknowingly use this awesome power to produce negative circumstances when they could have learned to use it for success. I have this book as part of my permanent collection of favorite books. Review written by Eddie Coronado, author of the Amazon.com book titled &#34;Manifest Your Millions: A Lottery Winner Shares his Law of Attraction Secrets&#34;
0739352989|3.0|I purchased this for my husband to listen too. The girl who does the narrating, also does the voice for Christian and it just sounds too corny. A little difficult to listen to sometimes because of it. They should have used a male voice for him and it would have sounded much better.
B00D7NWTSI|4.0|I have alot of friends who thought very mediocre things about this installment of the franchise. To put it simply, The first Iron Man movie is still my favorite, with the second one being very average for me, maybe a 3 on this 5 star system. This one is a definite upgrade to Iron Man 2 and fun movie to watch! Enjoyed the 3D in the theaters, and it works well at home, too. I know alot of fans were upset with The Mandarin twist, and I knew that would happen as soon as I saw the movie opening day. It bugged me as a comic fan, but by no means keeps me from enjoying the experience. Plus, it's not the Green Lantern movie! :)
B007QPFGJW|4.0|Well developed characters and solid plot. I wish Jo Nesbo books had been released in order of original publication. It is a great series.
B00B2166BS|5.0|I've been using this charger on my Nexus 10 for about a year now and it works great. It makes attaching the charger so easy, and without any worries about damaging the USB port.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game. The only problem is that you have to ask friends for tickets. If I was you I would get this game.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|you should really get this app. Its really fun and you get to disguise you're minions as all different things. you'll be happy when you get this app.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|Great series.  I have completed season 1 and loved each episode.  I cannot wait to watch the entire series available on Amazon Prime.  Thanks for making it available.
B005LAII12|5.0|We saw this in the theater and enjoyed it.  We don't go to see these kind of movies for intellectual purposes, but just for laughs and boy did we laugh.
B00CM4VC7M|5.0|I loved this action I figure, is well made and has several games as hands and faces you can put it in any position. cro for the price and quality of product the price is pretty good. I highly recommend it

B00BD99JMW|5.0|Wonderful ending to a beautiful series!  You have to read it before they ruin it with a movie.  Couldn't put it down.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I only take the time to write product reviews when I honestly feel its necessary.  I've been gaming for almost 15 years.  I normally do mainstream items. Top End products with a name to back them.  There are many things in this world you can cut corners on, but when it comes to electronics you really want to pay the extra money for those higher quality parts.<br /><br />I chose to upgrade to this mouse, never hearing of the Anker brand in lieu of the Logitech I was looking at. The reviews were decent and the price was amazing.  I've tested the mouse for a month now and have had NO problems with it.  The software is well written and easy to understand.  The colors are nice and are easy to customize.  The mouse moves smoothly and the weight can be tailored for individual needs. I use this mouse to play Final Fantasy XIV: ARR and Battlefield 4 and have experienced no issues with it.  The ability to change DPI on the fly up to 8,000 is amazing.  Especially when it comes to a quick 180 turn in an FPS in game.<br /><br />The mouse feels solid and works as intended.  This is a GREAT choice if you're on a budget and not afraid to take a leap of faith.  I upgraded to it from a Microsoft Sidewinder, and had almost purchased a Logitech for twice the price.  Very glad that I went with this product.  Anker is trying to break into the market and I with the hardware they are putting out, I totally support them.  I am looking forward to future products.<br /><br />A quick note on the software.  How to utilize the extra buttons.  You map the buttons to keys on your keyboard via the software provided with the mouse.  Then once you are in your game, you map THAT button to what you want it do.  It works solid and works in correlation with combination keys.<br /><br />Example:  I mapped the left side far back button to Num Pad 0, and then mapped that to shift + Num Pad 0 in my game.  When I hit Shift + the far back button, the skill executes.  It's flawless.
B000QRIGLC|4.0|Lone Survivor is a great book.  It starts off a little slow and repetitive, but I suggest reading it to obtain the details missed by the upcoming movie.

B00ADQPB50|5.0|Great season. Watched this like a movie marathon in only took two days. Totally captivating. Delivery was fast can't wait for the third season.
B00915G6WQ|3.0|Mediocre writing, apathetic acting and a serious disappointment for true Dexter fans. We all know that this series goes downhill after this season.
B00EL8I8IS|5.0|Just a fun, suspenseful, exciting movie.  My favorite Brad Pitt movie, by far. Recommend for anyone interested in sci-fi / zombies!
B00GLX0Z8C|4.0|Lots of laughs, but be warned...pretty crude humor.  The &#34;child actors&#34; are the highlight of the movie and steal quite a few scenes.

I swear, I don't care how good the reviews are....I will only download the free part, JUST SO THAT I CAN tell G5 I won't give them a penny until the games goes down to at least $2.99, just as Alawar &amp; Big Fish are. G5, you are very talented,/ but not anymore so then Alawar,or Big Fish!<br /><br />I NEED YA'LL TO GET ON BOARD WITH ME!<br />Like about another reviewer said, Times are very hard, &amp; the holidays.<br />Also, as another reviewer also said, there absolutely are 3 New ones out right now that are AMAZING!

SOOOOOO GOOD!<br /><br />G5, I am looking very forward to purchasing your games again, but I just refuse to, until the price is reasonable.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|It's a fun diversion but the graphics are not very sophisticated. I don't like having a time out, but I don't care for the game well enough to purchase additional time. I might consider upgrading to a better version some time down the road if the game still interests me enough
B005LN5UOC|4.0|So anyone who online games knows that a good headset is essential for playing most efficiently with groups.  Novice gamers also know that a headset provides a good way to socialize during online play.  The Gioteck EX03 is a good headset for either group, but there are some small flaws.<br /><br />UNBOXING:<br /><br />The EX03 comes in a small 7x5x1.5\\" box, decorated with a camouflaged EX03 on front and a background silhouette of soldiers and smoke. Inside is a white protective box and a resealable plastic baggie with instructions, the EX03, a USB charger, and 3 sizes of earbuds.<br /><br />REVIEW:<br /><br />The EX03 is easy to wear, but careful not to lose the earbuds--it is painful to wear the EX03 without them.  It's very light and weighs about an ounce or so.  On my ear, I can hardly tell it's there.  The instructions go through (with pictures) how to pair it with your PS3 and use the buttons.  The pairing is very easy--just follow the instructions and the PS3's online prompts.  The buttons are set up in a typical 3 button configuration: power (also acts as mute when EX03 is on), vol up, vol down.  The buttons are also different shaped, so I didn't have any problems figuring out which was which when the EX03 was on my head.  Then there's the charging: red LED and blue LED indicators show when charging is needed and finished.  As for charging though, the USB connector is not a micro/mini usb end--it's proprietary to Gioteck.  Therefore you cannot charge the headset on a typical USB charger.  Do not lose the charging cord!<br /><br />As far as functionality, I find it's a mixed bag.  Depending on which games I play, there is good and bad feedback from my friends.  Some say they can hear me crystal clear, while others say I'm barely audible and there's a lot of background noise.  Interesting since the EX03 is supposed to have noise-cancellation in the mic.  To me, I just can't figure out how a mic that barely goes to the middle of my cheek is supposed to pick up sound anyway, so the fact that some of my friends can hear me is kind of a technological miracle.<br /><br />OVERALL:<br /><br />I recommend the EX03.  When it can be heard, the quality is great.  However, sometimes it can't be heard real well.  The other cons are the lack of extra earplugs and the proprietary charging cord.  The fact that the sound quality is 50/50 good and bad, I can't really say it's better than others.  Overall, form factor, weight, comfort, button placement edge out the cons.  For the money, this is a good bet.
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|Exciting and Denzel Washington is great! Powerful describes it well! Good story with a moral.  Very human experience. A must see.
1607066017|5.0|When Brian K. Vaughan ran off to write for television at the conclusion of Y: The Last Man and Ex Machina, I never thought he'd come back—not on top form, at any rate.  Thankfully, Saga indicates otherwise.  It's highly unique in terms of story and art (so unique the Star Wars influence is not readily apparent); it's exciting and heartbreaking, sometimes all at once.  Like any good book, it compels the reader to turn the page, to find out what happens next; it compels the reader to care.<br /><br />I've had issues in the past with trade paperbacks bought via Amazon.  Some of them seem to be stored in an environment that's not so good for the binding and as a result pages pop out like dry leaves off a tree in autumn.  This particular copy of Saga doesn't suffer from such an issue and the paper quality is superior to, say, the stuff found in 100 Bullets collections.  I'm told it's glossy, like a magazine but thicker.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Husband, son and I all love this! So fun! Kept my 4 year old and I entertained on a long trip
B00G32OMF8|4.0|I Wish I had skipped the first film &#34;Before Sunrise&#34; which, to me, limits the stature of their romance.  I would also advise against reading any plot summaries, as trying to fill in the gaps of these long stretches of years using your own imagination is the fun part.  I subtracted a star for the somewhat rushed hotel sequence and for minutes wasted on new characters that speak mostly generic topics and draw too much attention away from this couple that the audience already has an emotional investment in.  After they go off alone, the conversations become much more personal in every way.
B00BC254I8|5.0|Amazing imagery. This was a very vivid, no holds barred book. I sympathize with the Champ's plight and pray for his peace. Thanks for sharing your journey.
B001VB8UAE|5.0|Ms. Streisand &#34;conceived and produced&#34; this, and most of her other, concert performances, and I am astounded at the vignettes she sets up, her fantastic ease in talking with and to her audience (her one-liners are as entertaining as the music!), and these concerts just come together in their entirety as works of sheer brilliance and excellence.  I am more than pleased with every purchase I have made of either her music or concert performances.
0743289692|5.0|Very interesting reading.  This author is excellent at keeping you interested in this book.  I could not put it down on the plane.
B00BXDOSXS|3.0|It works pretty good on my kindle fire hd but when I add movies to my tablet it won't pick them up. I have to uninstall it and reinstall for the app to pick up the new movies. Very annoying.
B00FY2N81W|5.0|It was awesome! Not a let down still has you enjoying every minute. Can't wait till Fast 7 hope that will be 2014. Most movies get boring and tired after 2 but this series just get more interesting
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|amazing and fun this game is a lot of fun and is a great way to pass time. More please!
B00GINENG0|5.0|I love this game! I go crazy trying to win as many coins as I can to take care of my kitty!
0810996596|3.0|I'm a HUGE Kirk Hammett fan!  I preordered this book and couldn't wait to get it.  It's got a LOT of stuff in it, but the stuff it doesn't have is the stuff I was wanting most.  I really was hoping that he'd tell the story of how/where he acquired most of the stuff, but really he just talks about the piece itself.  Might be exactly what you're hoping, but for me, I was wanting more of the backstory.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is really AWESOME. I LOVE IT LIKE NOBODY'S BUSINESS!!!!(not mine either) theirs not one fault ........ Except that I am ADDICTED TO THE GAME. You haven't lived without this game... yet...
B00992CF6W|4.0|Makes me motion sick because of all the movement, but a fun game overall! Love creating worlds with different terrains.
B0030IIYYS|5.0|My grandsons loved Watching the movie. We bought other movies suggested As well such as planes. Great deal. Lots of family fun
B005LAII1C|5.0|This movie is NOT for kids!  For some reason, I saw an unusual amount of parents taking their children to see this movie and unless they couldn't read the &#34;R&#34; rating, they must just be nuts?!  I can not stress this enough, it is for ADULTS ONLY!  That being said, it is ridiculously funny!  There isn't one scene that won't make you laugh!
B0063GORYU|5.0|This game is fun and never gets  boring. I play it more than any other spider solitaire game. I give it five stars.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I wouldn't even give this app one star because when youre getting addicted and  right in the middle of playing you have to do a dumb vector battle and it ALWAYS Makes you lose<br /> You barely even get to play<br /><br />- mad customer
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This is such a great game. Beautiful graphics, you can customise your guns, it's really easy to get money fast, and it starts you off with a pretty good rifle and shotgun. A couple down sides are: 1) it's one of those games that requires energy to play a level 2) some levels the require you to upgrade your gun. But, a few up sides are 1) it may take energy to play levels but every time u level up it refills it. 2) u can make up the money used to upgrade your weapon pretty fast.
B0063GORYU|5.0|The interface is intuitive and easy to use. I have successfully beat the game on numerous occasions now.  I recommend it.
B00FWLSLJ4|3.0|Good special effects, it you like Godzilla you will like this movie. Not much else to say about it. Sci-fi.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|l really love this app. Free and there r not many pop up ads.Cute game really! I gave it five stars.
B00G21XNKU|5.0|Just completely amazing!!!!! Can't wait for the Christmas special!!!! Not ready to give up matt smith yet :( if u don't watch doctor who yet you have to start
034580404X|4.0|Very steamy trilogy as promised though I felt myself getting angry at the author for dismissing some scenes with such nonchalance.  For instance, there was a very emotional scene where Christian allowed Ana to explore his upper body within the limits of the lines he had drawn on himself. James had an opportunity here to expand their characters and allow them a deeper connection. Just as I was becoming riveted in the raw emotion between Ana and Christian, the author pulls away from the storyline and I was left feeling unsatisfied. I feel that James took the easy way out with this series and succumbed to media pressure by concentrating on the sexual aspect of the books. She has a way with detail and I think her talent could have been applied so easily to expanding her character's depth. Hopefully now that she's had exposure, her subsequent novels will be more plot driven. I look forward to more steamy stories.
B00280LYIC|1.0|It was dumb in the first chapters<br />Q yt? if such. Sierra Leone the A's to understand how much enough for the awesome to understand how it works
B00FJMK9VE|5.0|It's got all of the style of the 80s. But much heavier. Michael's voice is amazing as always. This is a perfect album to bring you into the world of Stryper.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This was a wonderfully written story, thank you for sharing this simple love story.  I will recommend this to many others
B00AG472DS|5.0|A great true crime film, one of the very best. I love period movies if they are historically accurate. One little bit of anachronism can ruin the whole movie for me. Fortunately that did not happen with Zodiac. With the disk of extras it soon becomes apparent that the best special effects are those you don't notice. Like magic the San Francisco cityscape evolves from the mid and late 60s through the 70s and later. And some of the more grisly scenes are done with state of the art CG as well.<br /><br />The movie is about the Zodiac killings in the San Francisco Bay area that gained national recognition in the summer of 1969. But the case took a back seat to the Sharon Tate killings by the Manson Family in LA, the first moon landing, Woodstock, the Vietnam War, and so on.<br /><br />I remember hearing about it at the time (I was 17 or so) but it faded from public notice nationally due to the inability of law enforcement to find the killer. It was, however, front page news in Northern California for a long time.<br /><br />This movie is a documentary of sorts, but it keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. Get this Blu Ray! You'll get several evenings of entertainment from it because the incredible detail and the complex dynamics of the evolving murder cases require multiple viewings.<br /><br />Two thumbs up!
B00GT4V5DM|5.0|It works, plain and simple.  I also use a free version of Norton's 360 via my cable company and it doesn't pick up what Malwarebytes does.  They work in tandem, so I don't recommend Malwarebytes as your only anti-virus program.  The pro version protects in real time, the free version removes malware only when you run a scan, after it is on your computer....
B00EQ0CKRQ|4.0|The graphics are great I love the cars and the different places to race and I just have to say money well spent.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|The candy crush saga is colorful, and tons of fun. It keeps the mind limber with interesting puzzle games and can be challenging. I like the fact that you can win your way to more coins and new areas without buying anything, although there is that option as well.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Keeps you on the edge of your seat; page turner for sure. Can't wait to start Catching Fire!!! I love this book!!!
B00EKQ3YZI|4.0|Being a lifelong Donna fan I really had high hope for this CD.  While it does offer up some genuinely good remixes, when it fails,  It burns up on impact -  IE:  &#34;Working the midnight shift&#34; using someone other than Donna singing lead vocal? - See &#34;countdown mixmasters&#34; Cd's in wal mart's dollar bin for an example of that mess.  Definitely worth the buy for the good songs, but you honestly wont just press  play and let it go.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Show dives deeper into character development and plot depth, while still keeping viewer engaged and hanging on the edge for more.
B00004YA66|5.0|I love this movie. Saw it the day it came out and then bought the vhs. Just ordered the dvd
B000YMHOUS|2.0|It was an OK story, a little corny at times and predictable but good.  There is enough of an original story to make it a worthwhile movie to watch.  Especially if you want a quiet relaxing evening.
B00GIZO674|4.0|I rate this app 4 stars because it only gives u a couple of levels to play and if u want more levels u have to pay money
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Devious VisionZz, Devious SmokeZz, Devious ScopeZz, Devious DreamZz, but they are cool PeopLe  to have in it. Awesome. Jose andJorge
0316666343|5.0|Quick delivery and book was in good shape. I will purchase another book thru this system. Great way to save time and money.
B00GH4RKYM|4.0|Great interpretation of the superman story. I only gave it four stars because of a few inappropriate words (there shouldn't be any bad language in super hero movies imho) and the special effects at times looked more like a video game than a feature film. I also thought that superman and the villians crashing through 10 buildings time after time was way overdone. That being said, I still greatly enjoyed it. I liked how it started with a more in depth look at how krypton met its fate, how superman grew up, that Lois lane already knows his identity and superman didn't start his secret identity until the very end. That was a great way to end the movie. Can't wait for the sequels!
0345529057|5.0|I bought this for my son and he really was well pleased.  He was quite excited to receive this gift.
B0055D3EOG|1.0|I was not able to stream this movie to my TV, plain and simple.  Wasn't about to watch it on a 15&#34; laptop when I have a 45&#34; TV to view movies on.  Waste of my money!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I like everything but the pay for items and the condescending time outs - Come back back in ten minutes - don't need to play that bad!
B0053TMP24|5.0|Loved it. I am a young reader and I have read every Percy Jackson books. I have read the Kane chronicles. I loved it all. I think this book had so much action it was perfect.
B00AQL8VU4|4.0|I don't like the fact that it doesn't have a rear camera, but other than that it is well worth the price and very handy.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Glad to see Candy Crush on Kindle. Got the Kindle for reading books, but find myself playing Candy Crush too much! Additive and fun game.
B009EHDU7U|4.0|This is a brilliant story that could easily be made into a fantastic film.  I liked in particular the querkiness the author applied to tell the  story.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Product works nicely and produces an edge very quickly on a fairly dull blade. Ceramic and carbide slots work great, have not used pick for serrated blades yet.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|The graphics are great and the scenarios fit actual hunting experiences. My kids love to see the different animals. Another great app from Glu Mobile!
B0009IOR6Q|2.0|Crybaby is a Rockabilly cult classic musical. I, for one, am not a fan of musicals, but I love vintage style. So, to pay homage to true Rockabilly fans, I chose to purchase this. Had I not read the summary on Wikipedia prior to viewing this movie, I'm not sure that I would've completely understood what was going on. The storyline was rubbish. Surprisingly, the music was fantastic, though.  If I could give it 2 1/2 stars, I would.  People who rave about this movie, probably enjoy the music & the wardrobe, and care very little about dialogue or content.  And in true John Waters form, it was satirical & campy.  Johnny Depp is Hottt, though...
B00F35B8F8|3.0|Hyped up movie... Felt lacking all throughout. NO SCIENCE! An example of a dumbed down nation. Replaced science, technology, and integrity for love triangles. Yes, relationships and even quarrels are present in ALL Star Trek series but in this movie it felt over dramatized and it ended up annoying me. Jonathan Frakes is a better Star Trek director.
006202406X|1.0|I must say that I ABSOLUTELY devoured the first book! I loved it.  The 2nd was pretty good too. But this one...........I TOTALLY HATED THE EDNDING!!!!! I can't believe she did that.  Just know that I will NEVER EVER read another book from this author.  Completely disappointed in the ending. I was aslo very very angry. It ruined my whole day!  Good story ruined by a crappy ending.
0439023513|4.0|SPOILER WARNING<br /><br />I can understand why so many people dislike the book - it is not a happy one nor a heroic one. HOWEVER it is extremely realistic and reflective of the realities of war as well as a commentary on maintaining a public image. Not everything makes sense, not everyone becomes a hero, and not everyone lives happily ever after. If you expected the book to start or end with the characters kicking their heels and laughing, you have obviously not read the first two books in the series. Characters will suffer from PTSD, Katniss's team pretty much gets kills off quickly and gruesomely with no heroic or cool death scene to honor them, Katniss's team didn't even have to be in the midst of battle for the war to be won (pretty much things would've ended the same even if Katniss stayed in 13), there are long and boring logistics instead of flashy fights, and survivors are still scarred.<br /><br />This book ended the way it should but I guess the only things I'm dissatisfied with are not knowing the fates of people like Effie and Haymitch as well as the fact that Katniss spent half the book worried sick about Peeta but as soon as he is back, she treats him like trash.<br /><br />For those who say it is not as good or creative as the first book, remember that because Hunger Games was first, people read it with zero expectations and new eyes. By the third book, we are familiar with everything and it's not as exciting nor is it supposed to be. Katniss fought in the first book cause she had to but in Mockingjay, she wasn't required to nor did she want to. She also is not the person who she was in the first book. After going through two Hunger Games AND seeing a butt-ton of people she loved/cared for die because of her, she is no longer the strong independent girl she ones was. She is depressed, listless, and uncaring. She is no longer the same person who could love and related to Gale, someone who wasn't as scarred as her.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|This is an amazing games and the actions on most of the guns are very realistic. One thing they should add a couple more guns but worth the money.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is an awesome game. I love how when I complete a family  I get  say is AWESOMEa special prize. It has a lot of special qualities. So all I have to
0792163710|5.0|The classic story is, of course great, with fine acting and pacing.  This 4:3 version as originally filmed is beautifully presented, giving the full original image.  (As I understand it, it was filmed before widescreen became popular, matted top and bottom to create a widescreen image for theatrical release, then matted left and right to create the VHS image, losing resolution at each step.  This version has returned to the starting point with full resolution.  It's beautiful.)
B00E7Z7D2M|5.0|I honestly don't think that Robert Glasper could go wrong with anything.  Its as if he pulls the beauty out of everything he touches. Including the artists as well as the music.  My favorite track is Trust featuring Marsha Ambrosius. I also like the track with Dwele - Worries, Norah Jones - Let It Ride, I mean honestly the whole darn cd is worth listening to from beginning to end. Please purchase it. You will not be disappointed.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|I am a grandma and really enjoy the game! Some r more challenging than others. Have 3 stars on all but 2 of the first  half. The only thing they don't tell you what the Birds do once they have shown it to you. But it's a blast!!!<br /> Cheerful Grandma Bib.
B0009S4IHY|4.0|Very entertaining and enjoyed the musical score plus dance scene. Athletic Kung Fu and special effects. Stephen Chow is exceptional.
B000QUCPWU|5.0|I bought it for the 2 famous cuts, &#34;Green Onions&#34; and &#34;Time Is Tight&#34; and the somewhat well-known &#34;Hang 'Em High&#34; but discovered unknown treasures in &#34;My Sweet Potato,&#34; &#34;Sunday Sermon&#34; and &#34;Melting Pot.&#34;  &#34;Sunday Sermon&#34; is relaxation captured perfectly and &#34;Melting Pot&#34; has some inspired drum passages.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|It does what it promises. But I feel very much the lack of desktop streaming and better local video files streaming support.<br />But for Youtube and Netflix, it is perfect!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|better than the original facebook version, hopefully it will. not get buggy like the original<br />playing for a day and still fun
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|I was playing this game so my kindle fire went back to home screen and .I go back on deer Hunter 2014 and the take my last two energy
B00FWLSLJ4|3.0|The movie was fun. It wasn't a cinematic masterpiece, but I don't regret renting it. The characters were a bit contrived, and the acting wasn't always the best, but the plot was interesting.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|has glitch after glitch refused to download a million times and actually does charge money this sucks all the way around
B0050DIWFC|5.0|How far will parents go to save their child? And are they capable of thinking the unthinkable about him? &#34;Defending Jacob&#34; is filled with drama, both in the courtroom and within the family. I couldn't put down this tense psychological thriller until it had reached it's devastating conclusion.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book was amazing.  It is very different from anything that I ever read and would recommend it to anyone.  In fact several of my friends may get it for Christmas.
B00GTZN0X4|3.0|Def not cars butthe kids were entertained. banks on the magic of cars but lacks the magic created by it. the characters were a little flat with a predictable storyline
B00969PR18|5.0|I have WiFi and there is no problem but if u look on 1 of the comments they said u need WiFi but u don't and I have a Kindle fire so u are wrong girl / boy<br />I love this app
031606792X|5.0|I made the mistake of reading the small book 'The Short Second Life of Bree Tanner' before book 4 and, can you believe, Stephenie Meyer told the ending of the Twilight series in Bree's book.  I really didn't want to know the end and would have dragged out book 4 because I was enjoying it so much.
B00GLX0Z8C|1.0|I didn't laugh once during this bad excuse for a comedy. I'm not a Jennifer Aniston fan and these movies are one of the many reasons why. Don't waste your time on this!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire story. Couldn't put the book down once I started. Loved it.
B000OYC3J8|5.0|love this band , every song on every album ,is top notch. genius guitar genius lyrics .i cant complane about anything 'cept my spelling
B000GWE44U|5.0|Stanley Kubrick is such an amazing director! The story is perfectly set up to draw you into the sense of isolation and insanity. It is not Jack Torrence that is crazy, it is the Outlook Hotel. Amazing performances and groundbreaking cinematography make this one of the all time greatest Horror films ever made.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I've noticed Vudu and Netflix appear to have a higher quality HD stream.  This movie is great, and the stream was good but does not seem to be the highest available.
B00E5C3AJM|1.0|The Game is great! However, the developer is horrible, they do not reply to reported issues, emails or fb. Also In app purchases dont post.
B001BANK32|5.0|A movie simply cannot duplicate a story like this one.  The detail and emotion and creepiness is so much more amplified in the prose.  The movie was good and a commercial success but the book is absolutely worth the time to read it.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Addicting game! Fun to play. Like how the objects are in different places. Definitely worth the download. You will enjoy this game.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad that I can get candy crush on my Kindle now I can play it when my computer off
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|This little gadget from google it's ok if you have an old TV.  Newer TV comes with Apps for Netflix, Hulu, etc., so it didn't do anything for me.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Really fun and addicting. The only problem is things take so long to make which I guess is the running trend for games now
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Gkad they finally got it on Amazom. I like the game a lot. It's very addicting and fun to play.
B00GKS2HN4|2.0|Not enough items to hunt for, very little clues, too difficult to move on. Nice graphics though. Not enough to keep
B00005JMFQ|5.0|Although the movie is sweet and lovely, I watch it mostly for the parts with Colin Firth.  And, he is wonderful.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, it was a hard to put down. I always said to myself one more page..one more page. Surprising twists are common, and it will keep you on the edge of your seat!
B00AYIJJEQ|5.0|This show about broadway &<br />Great musical productions Is magic<br />Season 1 & 2 on DVD NOW!!!<br />Best recent classy TV show in years!!<br />TV gone to the lowest levels in history with the best technology<br />This adult version musical drama is like an adult GLEE!

B00DBO1YMK|5.0|Beautiful music!! Every song a joy to listen to. The Piano Guys are extremely gifted ! I will recommend to my friends and family
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is an amazing book. Great story and hard to put down.  The movie doesn't do it justice.  You can read it over and over and feels like your a part of the whole experience.  Highly recommend it.
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|I absolutely love this app for LinkedIn. I am able to more effectively keep in touch with my colleagues and acquaintances thanks to this app!
0618001905|5.0|This is an amazing book, exposing the truth about several historical people that are normally revered.  The Congo has suffered so much because of its wealth of rubber, ivory, and now minerals.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|you cant beat the graphics and gameplay with any other free game out there. the weapons are so realistic and the death animations are spot on.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I am on twitter all the time. Whether if I am making tweets, or just looking at what everyone else posted; this app is beneficial because it makes it more efficient to navigate.
0307341577|5.0|Such a great book. Grabbed me at the first paragraph and didn't let go. The characters are so intricately developed and flawed but in a way that becomes endearing and, ultimately, heartbreaking.
B005HED11Y|5.0|Just started watching in November 2013, and I love it. I keep it going in the background no matter what I'm doing. It really makes you feel like the anything will be possible in the future if we focus on learning and understanding the right things.
B00B8R1NP0|4.0|Time Killer by Todd M. Thiede is the first book I've read by this author and I must say I do see potential! I wasn't &#34;wowed&#34; but was pleasantly surprised. It took me a little bit of time to get &#34;into&#34; this book but after a couple chapters Theide had my attention. The characters are developed nicely and the plot moves along at a steady pace start to finish. So often a good book ends up losing steam partway through and with it the readers.<br /><br />After Max and Jesse got a couple hooks in me I was programmed to want more and that to me signifies a good writer. If you don't become attached to the characters in a story then the author hasn't done their job. For that Mr. Thiede gets a thumbs up. All in all this book is definitely worth the read and I look forward to reading the next masterpiece because I know it only gets better from here! Nicely done!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun, challenging enough that it took me longer than an hour to complete but solvable in a reasonable period of time
B00E8G5HDW|5.0|My son loves this I would recommend it for the young star wars lover in your family boy or girl
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This game.e is great just like the one on facebook.....lots of new stuff ...like the factual don't run out of energy
006202406X|5.0|It completed the series I was reading, I didnt see the ending coming it caught me off guard. Good last installment to the series.
B00GH4RKYM|2.0|A huge disappointment. This film had such potential. When Russell Crow (my favorite actor) is acting badly, you know you have poor directing and/or too many cooks in the kitchen. This is hard to believe considering how great Zack Snyder and Christopher Nolan are. The movie just had no \\"voice.\\" It felt like five different people made parts of the movie and then combined them into one lifeless, soulless, directionless mess.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|It was for grandkids and they love it.  Grandparents liked it too. It is a good family movie for everyone.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Generally a good film, a bit slow in parts, but a sci fi in the tradition of the film 2001 Space Odyssey. I wonder if there is a criticism in film regarding current  U.S. reckless use of drones, in the name of putting down terrorism?
B008XG1X18|5.0|this is my favorite app. I love all the great ideas I see on here. every new recipe I find is from pinterest.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I know the last thing you are thinking is &quot;why on earth would I ever involve myself in a game where the goal is to wipe humanity off the face of th  planet?&quot; I thought the same thing and passed this game numerous times but this game is one of the best strategy games I have played in ages! Spend your points wisely or you ate sure to fail, there are so many possible outcomes it is so much fun to experiment with new games time and time again! I recommend this to anyone who loves a good challenge.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|So fun great animation can play for hours I find myself laughing and don't even realize it till it's to late!
B002VX3RCW|5.0|I love this toy. It is bright and cute. Its for my grandson. The product was in perfect shape. It was delivered exactly when it said it would be.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Minecraft P.E is a very fun game, but God does it get boring fast. There is barely anything you can do right now, updates come out waaayyy to slow, controls could be better, creative is not the best, and the worlds are soo small. Personally I would recommend Terraria more then this but otherwise it is pretty good.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Great story.  Highlights a history that many in the south would choose to forget. Characters are familiar, believeable, and well developed.  Couldn't put it down!
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|I love this album!  Josh Groban is one of the best voices out there and this album captures more of that magic!!  Buy it!
B00364K6YW|5.0|I  am very pleased to receive tmy favorite verson of Pride and Prejudice. I particularlly like the major characters. Thanks for this copy
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very addicting! Hate it when I run out of lives and have to wait for more! You will fall in love with this game!
B00F8MI9NK|4.0|I loved Monsters Inc. so it wasn't a stretch to believe these original characters weren't going to be as likeable. I think the movie is a little overhyped and don't believe it kept up with its predecessor. Also I've been trying to add to my 3D video library and got this in 3D which was okay but not what I'd consider top notch. Animation usually translates well in 3D but they didn't have enough of it. I did like the movie and thought some of the new characters were very lovable. Art the arch shaped character was particularly amusing.
B00GQ7OZR0|5.0|The farewell season to one of my favorite shows. Personally not my favorite season, but a great end to see Dexter and Deb's life come undone. It has it's slow moving episodes at some points, but the pace picks up throughout and keeps you hooked to the last episode.
B003274QH6|5.0|Obviously since this has been one of the biggest hits of our culture in quite some time, I can't say much more then what that already says for the show. From the very first episode this series sucked me in and I couldn't get enough of Walter White. Thank goodness for Netflix where I was able to satisfy my feeding frenzy at record pace.
B002WV5A9G|4.0|A good movie, exciting and witty with memories of the previous franchise. Never been a huge Star Trek fan honestly, and fans of the originals may disagree, but I feel this film and its sequel &#34;Into Darkness&#34; have really brought the show back into action and the times.
B0025UHKNS|4.0|I really like this workout watch and it is 100 percent better then the Timex I had before it. I gave it 4 stars because it is a pretty complex animal and I think the battery life could be a bit better. The accuracy of the GPS is pretty phenomenal.
B003L77G2Y|5.0|Not sure if it's my favorite season, but for sure a great series of episodes. The plot continues to develop and any fan will enjoy to watch this next chapter in the Fringe Saga.
B003Q6D2BE|5.0|This is just plain good fun for the whole family, its a little predictable and slap stick but even after repeated views It remains one of my favorite flicks.
B005QYKE2Y|4.0|I loved the first in the series, but this one was just alright. It's hard to say if this one is better or worse than the second, I'd say about the same. Story and acting is alright, but the effects I will admit are freaking awesome. Great detail to them, and lots of great scenes as far as the effects go, that's for sure.
B0049EN064|5.0|Watched since its inception, this is one of the best, and latest, good clean entertainment ever run on TV!  I plan to buy the remaining seasons because our family loves this show so much.  It is feel good entertainment right down to Sheldon's most quirky moments!  What a shot!
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Helped me a lot to better understand the process. I would highly recommend to any first time author who's self-publishing to the Kindle. I would also recommend taking a brief read of the other title &#34;Publish On Amazon Kindle With Direct Publishing.&#34;
B003VANOFY|4.0|I have loved this headphones for at least 2 years now. The range on them is unbelieveable to me: I can be downstairs and on the opposite end of the house and they still work unless the microwave is on downstairs. The sound quality is superb and loud, earmuffs comfortable even after marathon sessions, microphone high quality, and overall build quality (was) durable and robust. The buttons (especially the mute/cough button) are very helpful and responsive. The battery life is very long*.<br /><br />The issue is over the past 6 months to a year they have been going progressively downhill. The device continually shuts off and turns back on when the charger is plugged in every few seconds, cutting out audio and the microphone. I initially thought this was caused by the device using the same frequency and channel as my router, but I later figured out it has something to do with either the battery and/or usb charging receptacle (female input on the bottom left earpiece). Sometimes the unit won't even charge and/or will shut off/on rapid fire if the battery gets low. Everything physically looks perfectly intact and I don't recall dropping these even once.<br /><br />I expect the unit to NEVER shut off or have trouble keeping the audio when it is plugged directly in with USB. It should prioritize a physical connection if available.<br /><br />A quick google search reveals plenty of people with similar problems, so much so that there is a video of how to solder a defect between the charging port and the internal circuit board. The battery is not designed to be easy to remove, with micro screws holding together a hidden panel, not for a novice to repair.<br /><br />Despite how much I've enjoyed this headset in the past, I have no choice but to rate this poorly. If I gave this a good rating it would be like recommending a model car that typically has a defect where the gas tank leaks and your engine will randomly shut off while driving.<br /><br />I suppose if you have deep pockets and don't mind shelling out this kind of money every 1-2 years, then go for it.<br /><br />UPDATE 1/13/2014: I spoke with Logitech support. I was surprised to find out the headset had a 3 year warranty. I was much more surprised to receive a brand new headset rather than a refurbished one! Based on my experiences with several other electronics companies, all but Logitech simply sends refurb units that typically have the same issue as the one you try to replace.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|Another great season for any fan of the show. Personally this is one of my favorite series, with its incredible and emotionally stirring performances. Not my personal favorite season but in my opinion one close to the top for sure. If you haven't seen the first six seasons, don't watch this one. Go back to season one and catch up to this point, you'll love it so much more. If you have seen every episode up to this point, get ready for another great season and the next chapter in the story.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I loved the story great for all to read. Made you think how we are so blessed. Loved the book , will look for the movie soon.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Some of the best movies ever made. This trilogy has an exciting and fast-paced story with ingenious characters. And a great deal to get all three movies in one package.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Fast paced movie, lots of sci-fi action and adventure in virtual space.  Pretty good story.  Different timeline from original Star Trek.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|How did I miss this as a kid?<br />I was not much of a reader growing up. Books did not capture my mind until after high school. I know I missed out on a lot, but at 33 years old, I am wondering how this ever escaped my reading list. Treasure Island is a great story about a boy who is somewhat forced to grow up rather quickly.<br />The story flows well and at times can keep you at the edge of your seat. There are times when our hero, Jim, is in situations where you fear for his life. The book has plenty of action to keep the young minds engaged. If you have not read this book yet, I would encourage you to pick it up. I think this is one of those stories every boy should read as well. The book is epic as far as setting and will help the reader's imagination come alive.<br />I read the Kindle version while on vacation in Florida. I am sure the setting helped me really dig into the book (the ocean in the background, the beaches, etc). I felt the Kindle version was well imported and formated well. Plus, it was free! Highly recommend!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I never would  have thought I could find such a good game that will keep my kids occupied and at the same time be a game that I could play too.
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|Hard to believe that this game is free. Lots of fun and tons of levels. Good graphics and not hard to use controls
B00GLX1MG6|3.0|It was only ok.showed the funniest parts in the preview. I would probably Not recommend it to a friend .It wasn't the funniest movie I've ever seen
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|Just today i got terraria. For 2$.  I had fun playing it until i had to play the tutorial to figure what i needed to do<br /><br />  P.S.  hope you buy this game
B0097HSS4M|5.0|I absolutely love this app so easy to use even a caveman could use it lol. Great job would highly recommend you get this app
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Great game good game it's wonderfully great<br /> The best game I have played in the Amazon store<br />It's just a great game get this game
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|Its fun and exciting but it is really expensive to buy upgrades. Other than that its really fun . Yeah!
B003WUYOQ6|4.0|Reading this book has changed my life. Applying the principles in this book led to my A1C dropping from 8.4 to 5.5 in just six weeks. Hoping to see it drop even more when I get tested again. Weight loss is a bonus -- I was in it to conquer diabetes II.
B00G21XNKU|5.0|I've loved Doctor Who for a while now and I have to say, this episode was amazing. Went in a way that I wasn't expecting as most good episodes of DW do, and it was great!
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I love historical fiction.  I also read Fall of Giants, which was really good; however both books have a tad too much of the romance novel taste to them for me. The characters stay with you - and given it is a long book, it was enjoyable and a good story.
B00E8S2JZ4|5.0|Peter Jackson has done it again - an extended edition well worth buying. If you love the movies and want to know the background story, the extended edition is for you. I wish such great background was the rule rather than the Peter Jackson exception.
B008LXZEYU|2.0|Not clear why this is some sort of cult favorite.  it is derivative with mediocre writing and acting like a high school production.  Has occasional moments, but overall not worth the effort.  I understand it is supposed to be a satire, but uses a flat butter knife, not a well pointed skewer.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|Can't get enough of Breaking Bad!  Great show! Nce to be able to watch whenever you want to watch an episode!
B0006ZFQP8|3.0|If you want to hear Tristan as intended by the composer, this would not be a good first choice.  It is however, a very good recording for any serious Wagner fan to own.  That being said...  please let me explain why...<br /><br />The recording sounds very much, as it is...  a kind of dry studio recording that brings to mind the dreadful experience of seeing an act or two of an opera performed as a &#34;concert piece&#34;, where the singers stand in row in tuxedos and gowns on stage in front of the orchestra and sing the parts to a very confused audience.  The way it was recorded, mixed and mastered is really a shame...  but hey, it was 1982 and that was a bizarre decade for all things audio!<br />It is not a poor performance of the work at all!  In fact, you will find some of the most inspired interpretations of the preludes within as well as a great opportunity to maybe hear some passages with a little more refined sound clarity.  But as a fair warning I will say that opera, especially Wagnerian opera, does not do very well in a studio recording environment.  While there are a few exceptions with a few of the Solti Wagner recordings, I would say that ALL of the finest recordings of Wagner's works are live performances.<br />So...  if you are looking for a great Tristan und Isolde, just get the 1953 Furtwangler recording or the 1966 Karl Bohm...  after you have worn those to the nub and need a fresh version get the Pappano (2005) or seek out Barenboim...  THEN get this recording.  After that you can go nuts and head into the 1930s recordings, other studio recordings, etc... and become a real social outcast.<br />I love listening to this recording...  but would never ever recommend this to anyone as a first recording...  why?  because I want them to enjoy the opera before they start enjoying the differences in recordings.
0449911357|2.0|i bought this book for my granny for her birthday...the book had yellowed pages,the back cover was bent..i wasnt to sure it was a new book..i would had sent it back but didnt have time...she is enjoying the book,i wasnt happy wit it at all....
B0001DI0FI|5.0|I just liked this movie, makes me think of all those brave people who sailed off wondering what they would find.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|love it have played for years in arcades good graphics it melted my interests every tyme I play it keep em coming
0345803493|5.0|Arrived in the time frame promised and it's a great book! I will be buying the 3rd one as soon as I finish this one!
B008JEJPXM|5.0|Very supportive and comfy footwear and lots of positive feedback from co workers. I plan to buy more for self and friends
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Not as good as the last one but still thoroughly amazing. One can not find a better series to read.
B004DLPXAO|2.0|I had a kindle touch and it broke.  I recently bought a samsung tab 3 and downloaded the kindle app but I am not seeing the books I bought!!!  Hunger Games and so many more.  Please help me I do not know what to do, the app seems so  limited compared to the Kindle itself which is not a very big deal but, I want my books back!!!!<br /><br />Anyone who can help me please respond.
B006IGZX0C|5.0|Good acting and good story. Pretty good portrayal of situation in the South in the 1950's. However, in a few instances the story is a bit unrealistic.
B000P0J09C|5.0|Very good,  it was intriguing to sorta see what went on in Viet Nam.  Marines are bad ass boys!  Great movie
B00BMVTTJ4|5.0|Outstanding movie - as good as Lord of the Rings but with new characters and plot.  Can't wait until next part is out in December.
B002KEZ96Y|4.0|It is darkly funny and ridiculous. If you are a fan of the Coen Brothers, this is a must see.
1400069289|5.0|Loved this book! It gives great examples about the power of developing positive habits and how they can improve your life. even some insight into addiction. As a teacher I am always trying to encourage positive behavior in my students. I highly recommend this book.
B00G4I1CLS|5.0|This was an extremely eye opening film! Both the quality of the film making and the overall narrative were so good. I was blown away at how little I knew about the treatment of orcas in captivity. Highly recommend.
B005F9TQ2Y|5.0|My husband lives Bob Dylan. I am slowly collecting these CDs for him. I am pleased that it came when it did and was in great condition.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|eye opening, food for thought (no pun intended). Personal observations of habits of certain dementia stricken persons suggest this may have merit. I also have experienced visual migranes thay are prevented by avoiding high glycemic load foods.<br />I need to follow some of this advice to see if I benefit.
B005F9TQ4C|5.0|The CD came on time and was in pristine condition. My husband could give a better review on the musical content, I'm just happy it got to me when it did and was what I was expecting.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Good Beach Read - not to be taken too seriously - plot driven - fun with a little Irish history thrown in.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|I really wanted to like this movie, especially because I loved Knocked Up. But this just wasn't funny at all and while I just turned 40 myself, it just didn't strike home for me.  Hate to put this on a do not watch list.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|I ordered as a gift, and he loved it. Anyone who is a fan of the band will be please.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Once I figured out how to get it to work with our TV I like the way movies come across. My only negative feeling is that the Amazon movies do not work on it so I am unable to get the most out of my Amazon Prime membership.
B008UX8G5A|5.0|I found it very easy reading. and gave me an insight into the life of the Royals of that time.<br />I like her work, she seems to be very well informed.  I have read other books by her and have enjoyed  them.<br />I have read  her fiction also. I can read her fiction and non-fictions and they follow closely
B008EEZ64Y|3.0|I read this for a school project and it was better than I thought it would be. It's a bit of a sad book. And some people say it's hard to handle and should not be allowed for kids to read and I can see why they say that but this book isn't all that bad. If you're an adult, unlike me, you may really really enjoy this book, as does my 30 yr old language arts teacher. I suggest this book for all ages.<br />-anonymous seventh grader
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|I like the game but in the movie I don't remember boast like extra damage and I would like it when I level up to give me like 2 or 4 tokens maybe this game can have an update and those can happen. I LIKE THIS GAME.
B008CJ0KI8|5.0|There is a reason that Frank Ocean won a Grammy for this album, and it's because it is so damn good.
B00G7QPTR0|4.0|I thought the documentary was very insightful and allowed you to see a lot of what the public doesn't see when she is on stage in her zone.  It was beautifully filmed, executed, and edited.  It was pure and honest.  If you're not a believer of this woman's dedication and soul, then I pity you if this didn't change your mind!<br /><br />I think the concert was an added bonus, but I was a little disappointed with the editing being as I saw this live and it was amazing (and quite frankly better than it's parred down reincarnation, The Mrs. Carter Show).  For one, it's a very scaled down version of the show, which clocked in at nearly if not slightly over two hours.  Several songs from the second half of the show are omitted like \\"I Miss You,\\" \\"Resentment,\\" the Goo Goo Dolls \\"Iris\\" cover, \\"If I Was a Boy,\\" the Lauryn Hill \\"Ex-Factor\\" cover, \\"Countdown,\\" \\"Irreplaceable,\\" \\"Jumpin' Jumpin',\\" and \\"Why Don't You Love Me.\\"  Two, I preferred the show without the editing.  \\"Love On Top,\\" came after \\"End of Time\\" but is played at the end during the credits.  \\"Countdown\\" was a stand-out performance from the show and only the intro was shown here.  \\"Run the World (Girls)\\" was also edited with the solo dancer intro shown first though it was performed at the end.<br /><br />Besides that, a great 2-for-1 bundle for any fan of Beyonce!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game I awesome I love it it is fun trying to bet my last score!!!<br /><br />  but I wish the costumes and other things would cost a little less...<br /><br />  that is my only thing I ask!!!
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Although I am android/google fan, I don't like this product because:<br />- of the restrictions it places on the usage. There are limited number of apps. Yes, you can use the chrome browser to stream a tab or the whole screen, but it is a hit and miss. The whole screen is experimental, so it is not clear it will always be there.<br />- The support in the apps needs more work. Once you start a stream, it is going through the chromecast directly. First, it has to rebuffer what had already started in the app (no way to start it the first time directly on the chromecast). Second, if the connection is slow, the rebuffering takes time (they could have transferred the queue from the computer to the chromecast, though I know this is harder than it sounds).<br />- I took this to a hotel, where they have a good wireless network and they didn't block this service. Maybe the computer and the chromecast were picking different access points, but, it took once 30 minutes to re-establish the connection to the chromecast from a PC and/or from an ipad.<br />In sum, I don't like the restrictions and it is half baked. For the price I could have kept it, but, I would like to show my dislike of the restrictions, and I will return it. I do have an apple TV which has the same restrictions, and I don't need another restrictive product.<br />Next time, I will just get a long hdmi cable along the PC, and that is good enough.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Tragic... But perfect finish. If you liked the first two, and have the stomach to take some serious loss... You won't want to miss this epic finale.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very fun &amp; very addictive. Hard to put down!!<br />I would recommend it to everyone. Thanks for bringing it to the Kindle Fire!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game. You can play it for a few minutes or for hours. The missions keep it challenging. Nice game for all ages.
B001HM1PFO|5.0|Shipped super fast, which is always a welcome surprise. My DVD library was lacking this one so I just had to have it.
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|Delightfully easy to read, well written, informative, and arranged in such a way that the reader never could lose interest!  I look forward to more books by this historian!
B002XBVQKW|4.0|Love this movie!  The sound didn't come through as clear as I would have liked, but the movie itself is classic!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|App works perfectly. I am totally addicted to Pinterest already. If you haven't tried it, Pinterest is a place to put things that you like, want to try or want to read later. It is an easy place to store recipes that you find online, workouts you want to try, outfits you want to put together, craft ideas or anything else you want to save. You can also enter keywords and find a ton of pins in a category that interests you. Well worth purchasing in my opinion. But watch out! You may become addicted, like me.
1452126607|5.0|I love the look of this grumpy cat.  The captions are cute and the squares for each day are large enough to write in multiple appointments, occasions, etc.  It is rather large, so it didn't fit on my mom's cupboard door, but it looks great on my freezer door in the kitchen.
B00915G6MG|5.0|I own all 10 seasons on DVD. I used to buy them at a local bookstore that gave a discount, but they went out of business. I was upset about that, but then I found them on Amazon with a very similar discount. Now I just pre-order it and it shows up when it's out. I love that!<br />NCIS is an amazing police drama. Mark Harmon is Gibbs, the boss. Michael Weatherly is Tony DiNozzo, senior field agent, and Sean Murray is Probie-Timothy McGee. In the first two seasons Sasha Alexander as Caitlin (Kate) Todd was a part or the team. Seasons 3-10 Cote de Pablo was Mussad liaison/probationary NCIS agent Ziva David. Pauley Perrette is Abby Scioto(?sp?), the goth forensic scientist. David McCallum and Brian Dietzen work in autopsy(Ducky and Jimmy Palmer).<br />The first two seasons, the NCIS Director was Tom Morrow, who we rarely saw and I don't know the actors name. Season 3-5 the NCIS Director was Jenny Shepard, played by Lauren Holly and we saw a lot of her as the Director became a more integral part of the storyline. Season 6-now (11), Rocky Carroll is  Director Leon Vance and he is often an integral part of the story as well.<br />The basic premise is find dead body, put together the clues, find the killer- with the occasional terrorist threat, assess, find terrorist, arrest or shoot terrorist. Your basic cop drama right? But the stories are very well written and the characters/actors work so well together.<br />If you are an NCIS fan you know this is worth having. If you've never seen NCIS, I highly recommend buying it- but start with season 1.
B00EUUJID6|5.0|These young men have the voices of angels.  WOW!  My daughter just loves this trio!  They did a very good job singing the classics.
B00G4EXNNM|5.0|This is an outstanding tribute to the Everly Brothers -- a profound influence on today's music via artists like Simon and Garfunkel. It's a remake of Don & Phil's &#34;Songs Our Daddy Taught Us.&#34; I had no idea that Billy Joe Armstrong of Green Day fame was such a nuanced singer, and his blending with Norah Jones is spot on. If you like Americana, and especially if you're an Everly Brothers fan, you'll love this album.
B00DLKXF3A|3.0|this is not the best album these guys released.  It was ok, but only has a few songs that i consider great.  Maybe more listening will make it better.<br />Delivery was awesome!
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Sycamore Row: a little hard to follow plot at times. Numerous and similar names were confusing. Enjoyed the &#34;peak&#34; into the area of the law and wills.
B00CZAYNOC|5.0|yet another great album!!  got it on the day it was released!  these guys have continued to make great music!
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|Think it stinks that you can't get past a level, even a hard one in less than a week or two unless you put out money, and I don't mean a dollar or two. I've been on 147 for two weeks and can't even get close to a win.: ( ready to delete.)
B0091VYG86|5.0|Amazing movie! Watch it! Love it! The story is still very &#34;Now&#34; and will make you appreciate what we have accomplished so far.

0446310786|5.0|Classic! One of my all time favorites! This is one that I can pick up again & still be entertained.
0380000725|3.0|The book is very old with tiny print and difficult for me to read. I expected old with the price but this one is tough to read.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|It seems really well made and I quite enjoy it. You should try it, it is very fun since there isn't an energy bar. Though money can be quite a pain...
B00B19G01C|5.0|very good movie.I just love these types of movies, the effects were great. I highly recommend watching this movie,Also a great buy.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I just love this game the graphics are cool and the people you need to defeat are hard but this game is a awesome time waster. I wish the stuff is cheaper so I can get more minion costumes .
B004LWZW2E|5.0|This is an awesome scary movie. I was at the edge of  my seat,  eyes half covered. Scared to death,  which is what a good horror film should do. I can not wait to see part two.
0545626382|5.0|Very good boxset. The books are very handy and comfortable to read and the cover and box is very nice.<br />I strongly recommend this edition!!
B00FWLSLJ4|4.0|This was a high tech, very visual, romantic thriller.  This movie reminded me a bit of a Japanese Godzilla movie...
B0066WJLU6|5.0|I am very proud of myself that I downloaded this App. Well, I only tested out to see if this is light enough so I could see better in the dark. And it was bright, very very bright. If your looking for a Flashlight App for your Kindle Fire, this is the one.
B001NLL93W|5.0|I found some information in this book a little &#34;omg! I totally knew that was going to happen!&#34;, but it still made the book. I love how well Cassandra describes the City of Glass. It's like I can imagine myself being there. The books just keep getting better the further you get into the series.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The thing I hate is the it's freezes and takes a long time to download but another than that it's fun :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :)
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Great continuation from the first book. Most people are skeptical on sequels but Cassandra Clare did an amazing job on this book. Everything is coming together nicely and could not ask for a series that I love more!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so awesome I love to play it. The only thing that is a problem is you need Wi-Fi to play.
B0071MDA2U|5.0|The sequel to Delirium did not disappoint!! This book makes me wonder what I would do in this situation. Be lobotomized and live a safe, comfortable life without emotion, or fight the cure and struggle against danger, starvation and cold for the rest of my life.<br /><br />Lena must learn to survive in the Wilds without Alex. It is tough-going. A group finds her and nurses her back to health. The group is hungry and cold most of the time. A few of their group get sick and die. Raven, their leader/mentor/mother-figure and Tack a rough and unfriendly survivor help keep what's left of the group safe. Raven, Tack and Lena sneak into the bordered areas with fake id's. Lena re-enrolls in school, pretending to be one of the cured.<br /><br />&#60;spoiler&#62; Lena is told she must keep tabs on Julian, son of Thomas Fineman, the head of the DFA. (Deliria Free America) Julian is their poster child, a young man who had brain tumors and still wants to have the cure even though it is dangerous and could kill him. Julian is kidnapped and Lena gets captured. They end up in the same holding cell. Julian has been programmed all his life to hate uncureds like Lena and Lena despises him. But their dire circumstances and mutual enemies (The scavengers, kidnappers) force them to work together. They escape and make their way to a safe homestead only to be recaptured by the regulators and separated again. Lena learns that the whole kidnapping was a setup by the resistance including Raven and Tack. Disappointed and disillusioned by the betrayal of Raven, she runs away intent on seeing Julian one more time before his execution. At this point I was so disgusted by the unfeeling attitude of Raven and her idea that better one of them die than one of our own, I had to put the book down. But Raven comes through in the end.&#60;spoiler&#62;<br /><br />Just when you think everything is going to be OK, the author throws a cliff-hanger at you that you won't believe. Incredible. I'm going to download book 3 right now.d book 3 right now.
B00G21XNKU|5.0|Walks the line between catering to fans of the old series and the new. Entertaining and amusing, but not revealing too much of the past and future.<br /><br />Yes, I feel I might have paid too much for it in the abstract, but being able to watch it on my schedule was important: it was worth the price of admission, and I'll watch it again.
B000000OU0|4.0|Gave this as a gift. The gift receiver enjoyed and appreciated this unique gift. It was delivered on time and in excellent condition.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|One of the best novels I've read in years. Great character development but not crazy about the didactic \\"this is the meaning of life\\" bit but enjoyed it immensely none the less.

0529064847|5.0|This bible suited the needs I had for a class I was taking.  Sturdy book.  A good choice for those who need a book for research.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|Why do all games need to tie to facebook<br />Not everyone uses or wants to use facebook<br />Other than not being rewarded if you ignore that portion of the game, it is fun
B009NXD6JM|4.0|Classic romantic comedy. Audrey Hepburn lights up the screen and is hypnotic to watch. It's a classic for a reason.
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|The Best album eminem ever created. even better than the first The Marshall Mathers, which got way to much hype.<br /><br />10/10
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My family loves game. It's great! Starts easy enough for my three year old to master and grows challenging enough for my husband to enjoy. Because we have this app on three device, we like to have Minion challenges. It's a really fun game.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Although there is a little bit of disappointment over this Fourth year, I suspend my criticism over little snippets of today's, or rather yesterday's, culture taking a place in the story because it is a fiction, it is a parallel, &#34;what if?&#34; and I like the labor over choices, to keep alive and remain human. I wish they would put a little of &#34;The Colony&#34;'s mad scientist splash in there and get some real nerdy-advance group that has no problem defending a sanctuary from the zombie hoards.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This is a cute fun game it's a great free game and one that I can waste my time with which is great on my slow nights at work.
0679805273|5.0|Bought a few dozen of this book for my daughter's graduation and for her friends as well.  The story is perfect for any teenager leaving for college.  Great price too!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I was looking for an alarm because mine broke. This is just like using the alarm clock you plug into the wall except it can go anywhere! I never have to set a hotel alarm clock again. It is easy to use and what we are used to using. Perfect for anyone at any age.
0399157573|5.0|I think this book is one of her best ever. Not one page was boring to me. An easy, smooth read all the way through. Good amount of forensic sciences, which I'm interested in and when I had to put it down, I was able to pick it up and start reading where I left off. Didn't have to reread several paragraphs to catch myself up. I think the book was very well done including the invite of a homeless man to the family Christmas dinner. That was the icing on the cake for a wonderfully written book. I really enjoyed it.
B00CEF014E|5.0|This book was hard to put down.  Page after page was full of suspense and questions.  The lead character was an unlikely heroine which made her even more lovable and enjoyable to read.  She pulled you into the story because you felt a strange desire to protect her and see that she made it out alive.  Did she?  You will have to read the book.  The twist and turns will leave you spinning like a top and they don't stop until the last page.  As you get pulled into the drama that could be ripped from today's headlines you will find yourself into a cult drama that is depicted well with the title of the book.  I hope you enjoy this book as much as I did.
B0099114WO|5.0|Love both of the actors in this movie. It so funny at times and loving the next. Enjoyed watching this movie very much.

B00C6CHTX6|4.0|The review was originally posted @ www.readmuse.blogspot.in<br /><br />DISCLAIMER: I am no supporter of Adolf Hitler. He was an “A” Class scoundrel for sure but that doesn't mean I can be biased while reviewing his book. This review is not intended to hurt any sentiments.<br /><br />I am writing this review about 7 years after I read the book. Back then when I read the book, I wasn't mature enough to know certain things (To be elaborated later). All I knew was Hitler was the reason behind the reduction of a huge of the population of the earth. But now my viewpoint has changed. It has changed so much that I remember Mein Kampf like I read it yesterday. Thanks to growing up.<br />Mein Kampf (My struggle) is an account of Hitler's life, his aspirations, his thought process as narrated by him. He has split the book into two volumes, Volume 1: The Reckoning and Volume 2: The National Socialist movement.<br /><br />Volume 1 : The Reckoning more or less narrates how exactly the seeds of “The National Socialist Movement “  was planted in his head. It is very apparent from this line as stated by Hitler; “While the Goddess of Suffering took me in her arms, often threatening to crush me, my will to resistance grew, and in the end this will was victorious” he was a fighter by spirit. He recounts how all the suffering changed him and his ideologies. How exactly did he suffer? He “was forced to earn a living” working as a daily laborer and as a painter. He went hungry for a long time yet he read books voraciously. Books seem to have been his best friend. He then goes on to state that he initially didn't understand two principles, Marxism and Jewry (Mr. Hitler. I don’t too. It would have been best not to have thought about those things back then!  Would have prevented a war you know).  But learning made him frame this mental picture of what earth & its philosophies were. In short, his rather crooked opinion of Jewish ideologies.<br />But Volume 1 isn't the interesting part.<br /><br />Volume 2 is where the serious thinking comes in. In volume 2 he elaborates his plans to wipe out the entire religion of Jew in German. He seems to have done a thorough analysis of his ideologies and ways to implement it. (Read steps to achieve “holocaust” or Genocide”).<br />Volume 2 was more compelling than the first volume. One tends to believe that Hitler was a true patriot and his ideologies are justified. Technically he looked like a saint compared to politicians today. Yes. That's the powerful writing in action. It's a classic example of how a political propaganda must be written. Volume two contained most of Hitler's military blueprints and Political aspirations.<br /><br />But there was this line in the last chapter, “All the persecutions of the movement and its individual leaders, all vilification and slanders, were powerless to harm it. The correctness of its ideas, the purity of its will, its supporters' spirit of self-sacrifice, have caused it to issue from all repressions strong than ever” which made me snap back to the harsh reality that Hitler's ideologies and methodologies were the reason many innocent people were butchered. Volume two is a true proof that he was the prime reason behind the death of 50 million people.<br />The book is an eye opener for someone who has no idea of the magnitude of his tyranny. This is “the book” for people who lack determination and that fighter spirit. But unlike Hitler one must learn to fight for the right thing.<br /><br />How is it even remotely possible for one individual (who was a vegetarian and loved only one women) to influence the world so much, destabilize peace and massacre millions? Simple. His determination. His unwavering stand on his beliefs. Most important of all, his hypnotic influence on people via his books, his writing and his speeches.<br /><br />The writer just wanted to explain to people, his ideologies and justify it. The book did that bang on. The debate ofwhether his ideologies are right or wrong is up to the reader. To any sane reader his ideologies would sound wrong. That's the beauty of the book. Hitler hypnotizes the readers, making them feel his ideologies are so valid. Yet his writing makes you understand how wrong he was. That’s the irony of the book.<br /><br />There were a lot of people in the Axis coalition who were responsible for Jews being slaughtered. But why is Hitler unforgettable while no one even cares to look upon who the “others” were? Read this book to know why.<br /><br />VERDICT: “The” book to be read before you die. A perfect example of “how to be” but “how not to be that”!<br /><br />RATING: 5 on 5 (ONLY AND ONLY FOR THE COMPELLING WRITING. I DO NOT SUPPORT HITLER'S IDEOLOGIES)
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|It's a great game but for some reason I can't move itums into my hot bar I still can't figure it out
B001KVZ6LQ|5.0|The movie itself is an unmitigated masterpiece: a spectacular story conceived by a man Kong-sized in spirit, one incredible real-life hero and adventurer Merian C. Cooper, with impeccable, flawlessly paced direction by Cooper and his also astounding associate Ernest Shoedsack, with a hand-in-glove masterful Max Steiner music score, a Gustave Dore-inspired jungle unlike any other jungle ever filmed, graced by a true Beauty in Fay Wray as Ann Darrow and a Beast that gives one of the Top 10 greatest screen performances ever - and does so despite being an 18\\" rabbit fur-covered, metal ball-and-socket puppet!  The man behind the movement, though, was Willis O'Brien, an authentic American genius unfortunately not given enough opportunities to gift us with his wares.  He is somewhat like Welles.  Both artists reached the tops of their own Empire State Buildings under the auspices of RKO. Welles, of course with CITIZEN KANE and O'Bie with KING KONG: both films ironically two word titles, both are names preceded by adjectives, both with the hard 'K'.  And both men, Welles and O'Brien, toppling from the heights due to the vagaries of popular taste and monied interests and personal demons.<br /><br />Anyway, speaking of monied interests, I was surprised to see the blatant, huckster's lie in the advert for the Blu-ray Book version of KONG.  The list of Special Features says:  THE LOST SPIDER PIT SEQUENCE IN ITS ENTIRETY.<br /><br />But this is an outright lie.  What is on the disc is NOT the actual and seemingly truly lost spider pit sequence.  What it really is is Peter Jackson's imaginative recreation of the actual and lost sequence.  This recreation is a segment of the multi-part documentary \\"RKO Production 601: The Making of Kong.\\"  Yet in the pitch it is made to seem like a separate special feature and NOT merely a part of the long documentary already listed as being on disc two.  I know many folks may be fooled by this false advertising, therefore this review.<br /><br />Despite the lie, white or otherwise, the movie is magnificent magic, all the way.  The second disc extras are all to be found on the DVD release. The Making of documentary is wonderful, even with a bit too much of Peter Jackson's input.  The other documentary is a rich and rewarding one on the incredible Merian C. Cooper who was the real-life model for Carl Denham, searcher for Skull Island and captor of Kong. Ten lives or more lived in one! I have the 2005 release in the tin box special edition.  Not sure if it is available anymore, but it is a beauty.<br /><br />Anyway,I never tire of watching this Monster Masterpiece because it is so rich and dense in detail that something new may be found in it with each viewing.  One example:  I was always aware of the boat - The Venture - way in the background in the scene where Bruce Cabot and Fay Wray are escaping from Kong via a vine hanging down the face of Skull Mountain.  But only recently did I also spot the actual giant wall just visible in the dense jungle foliage.  It is a wonderful detail in a wonderfully detailed film.  It gives one a visual sense of just how deep into the jungle Kong's mountain lair actually is - and how far Jack Driscoll has come to rescue Ann Darrow.<br /><br />KING KONG was a Thanksgiving TV tradition for many, many years here in the NY area.  With those nostalgic memories in mind I will settle down into my armchair this Thursday and book passage on The Venture and get lost in the wilds of Skull Island yet again, looking to spot yet another jewel in that fearsome and fantastic jungle.Despite the lie, white or otherwise, the movie is magnificent magic, all the way.

B00C2VIA52|5.0|I am a few hours in and I am really enjoying the game so far.  Clean interface and good looking cards.  Non intrusive IAP.  Runs great on original Kindle Fire
B005K0HDGE|5.0|King did an incredible job retelling this horrible fifty year old story.  His characters seems real and I found myself greatly wanting to step in to change history.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|there are some game issues  - loosing mail which looses lives and miscounting of moves by the game but overall I like the game - glad I can now play on kindle!!
0375869026|5.0|little girl got this because she did so well on achievement tests.  She does not like to read but read the first seven chapters the first night she got it.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Love this movie!  Another great flick in the Star Trek saga.  They transitioned from the old characters to the new crew very nicely in the last movie and this film adds another great chapter to the ongoing Star Trek story.  Very clever putting the shoe on the other foot in the final scenes of this movie.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Spider is a lot of fun to play. I enjoy the challenge with each new game,  while continuing to keep my interest even when I don't win. I enjoy playing this game daily.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|This game has turned into one of my guilty pleasures, pretty graphics and colorful. Reminds me a little of Minecraft.  It's a perfect game for my nephew.
B00BWQW73E|5.0|This book was very enjoyable and well written. At points I wondered about the other side of the story, but generally i felt the author attempted to keep his own bias out of the equation. Worth reading to learn more about the very interesting Jeff Bezos and the amazing company he's been at the helm of.
B00FHEP9XM|5.0|I LOVE this app!! It makes texting so much easier and quicker. Only drawback is it sometimes sticks a word in there that you did not type, so read your text before you send it!
B0030V0PEW|5.0|I ordered 400 copies for my co-workers and business associates. I even had my ten year old son read the book.  'nuff said
B00B2V66VS|1.0|Don't like this game at all! Just not my cup of tea... it might be fun for some, but not myself.
B007ZGBZHE|1.0|Totally unbelievable trite trash, starting with a filthy rich FBI agent as &#34;hero&#34;. The best thing about Kindle e-books, you can wipe them out with one tap.
B006VSP906|5.0|In a scene from my all time favourite film, Woody Allen’s Manhattan, Woody starts to recount those things that make life worth living. I have played this game with friends many times over the years. My list of things that make life worth living is; (family and friends are a given), Woody Allen of course, the film Manhattan, Virginia Woolf’s ‘Mrs Dalloway, Salvador Dali’s ‘Christ of St John on the Cross’, Charleston Farmhouse in Sussex, Monty Python’s ‘Life of Brian’, Morecambe and Wise, Peacock Butterflies, David Hockney’s ‘A Bigger Splash’, Hitchcock’s ‘Rear Window’, The Edinburgh Book Festival, David Sylvian, Philip Glass etc. Over the years there have been a few additions. Christopher Hitchens became one of those additions.<br />I have been putting off the reading of Mortality for sometime knowing full well the subject matter contained within its pages; not only the last words of a superlative orator and writer but details of his horrendous illness, oesophageal cancer. My cowardice probably also stems from the knowledge that I am less than ten years away from the age that Christopher Hitchens died, 62.<br />As to be expected the writing is not self-piteous, there is no element of self-aggrandizement in any of its 106 pages. Mr Hitchens style of writing makes one want to go around pulping every pencil, drain every pen and smash ones keyboard knowing that you will probably never write as well as he did. However, I am sure Christopher Hitchens would want you to buy new pencils, refill those pens and repair that keyboard and attempt to equal or better his writing.<br />In ‘Mortality’, as to be expected, religion rears its ugly head in the form of monotheists letting Mr Hitchens know that he deserves to die, that God has struck him down in vengeance. Christopher Hitchens in his usual pithy and direct manner surmised that God was rather mundane and routine in his vengeance to give him oesophageal cancer which was highly likely to occuranyway due to his heavy smoking.<br />My honorific review can never fully convey the extent of how wonderful the book is without falling into the quicksand of cliché. So, I will simply end this review with a direct and succinct command: READ THIS BOOK!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|you don't just hunt deer you also hunt wolf's and sometimes ducks there are hunts that you get Trophys for and all of that but you must reload energy which makes you want to play more instead of wait for your energy to get back. overall it is a fun game its not very grafic so I think any responsable person of any age can play. maybe not the kids under 10 though because it may premot violence but I greatly doubt that so good for anyone.
0812417755|2.0|This version is a hardback, but it's a TINY, small hardback. NOT the normal hardback size! Misleading. I wanted the normal hardback for my library.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love everything about it the excitement in the arena the cute love story. The whole time i was reading it i was amazed on how great it is. I highly recommend reading this story!
B00338QENI|5.0|This fascinating and enveloping narrative makes the science involved accessible and comprehensive to all readers and provides a human aspect to many of the important pharmaceutical and biological developments over the past 50 years. Rebecca Skloot truly succeeds in illustrating the many lives behind HeLa cells and does true justice to the story Deborah Lacks wanted to have told.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Removed the application after I attempted to use it once.  The application was difficult and confusing.  NOAA is better application
B003O86FMW|5.0|She's a gifted author& subject area is interesting to young adults & adults. Nice telling of reality in a metaphorical fiction.
B001U0HBPG|5.0|Beautiful  film. Should have been best picture. Wonderful chemistry between Blanchett and Pitt. New Orleans has never seemed more other worldly (which it is).
B007Z8ZKS2|5.0|I had this book on my kindle wish-list for 6 months before I eventually read it.  I saw that it was receiving rave reviews online, but whenever I read the book description, I just thought &#34;whoa....cancer and teenagers - I am not in the right space for this&#34;.<br />I thought it would be heavy and hopeless, but I was wrong.<br /><br />The Fault in Our Stars is so well written. It oozes warmth. And despite the crushing ugliness of cancer, the story itself is luminous and not all doom and gloom.<br /><br />Even though I did shed a few hearty tears, the overall impact this book has had on me is profoundly uplifting.<br />Thank you John Green!<br />“Some infinities are bigger than other infinities.”
0316204366|5.0|As with many of his other books, this one by David Gladwell is a 'must read'. He pushes one to really think and reflect, and given the sensory assault we all have to endure from media, it's all the more pressing that people should read this book. Any faults commented by others (and I don't say they're incorrect) are more than offset by the freshness of thought Gladwell brings to this topic.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The book kept you on the edge and wanting to know what would happen next.  After I was 3/4th the way through the first book, I bought two and three.  Can't wait for the movie.
B00C8RGOSA|5.0|Such a sweet movie! the animation is fantastic. got it for my 3 year old for Christmas! a must have for your disney collection :)
B00EDY5KTA|5.0|I rarely purchase the soundtrack before seeing the movie but I was so thrilled to see that the songs were written by Tony Award-winner Robert Lopez (The Book of Mormon, Avenue Q) and Kristen Anderson-Lopez, and composed by Christopher Beck. The music is catchy and reminds me of some of my favorite animated Disney classic musicals. The Deluxe edition has some fun extras but if you don't care about those, just get the regular soundtrack. Cannot wait to see the movie.
B00005AR3G|5.0|Love this movie! I bought it for my daughter for Christmas. I haven't seen it in ages but it's hilarious. One of those Disney CLASSICS that are easily forgotten about!
B00CW7KK9K|5.0|Nice little tool for tracking your activity. It works nicely with the withings scales and I bought it to primarily stay within their ecosystem of tools. I like the heart monitor and sleeping tracker, which works best as a reference from itself on a moving average.
B004MPR80E|5.0|I am yet to complete the book, but it has been a great read. For a person without any medical background, this has been an eye opener regarding Cancer and its history. This book is just not about cancer, but also the human endurance to conquer this malady.
B00BXI0IHS|4.0|One of the most enjoyable reads in years. An epic story across a hundred years and so refreshing to have at its centre an un attractive woman scientist who is revealed completely
B002ECJZ76|5.0|This movie is amazing.  It is a foreign film translated in to English, but you will get so lost in the film that you won't even notice.  It has become one of family's favorites for Christmas.  It tells the story of a young boy that loses everything and learns to love and give despite it.  He grows up to become one of the most beloved icons of Christmas.  It's very, very sweet.  We rented it years ago, and then my husband found it on Amazon, and we just had to have it.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I do miss the network of neighbors, Facebook and non Facebook friends, through Zynga. I don't like when games try and make you invite your friends who don't play, nor do they want to, and you are understandably limited on getting gifts, etc.<br /><br />I don't know if the options change later, but the ability to plant trees to replace those cut down would be nice. It would be better to not have to spend so many crowns to obtain various things too.  The ability to also play on the PC would be a nice option in the future.<br /><br />I had halted playing the original game due to issues with the game freezing up, etc. This is a nice substitute so far and convenient since it can be played on mobile devices that I own. So far it is keeping my attention.
0316212261|5.0|Very charming and fun.  it makes me want to read more by this author.  I couldn't put the books down!
B00G9U7NEQ|4.0|Paused multiple times while we we watching it.  Probably our internet speed even though I have 50/25 service.  Good quality otherwise.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I thought this movie was better than the first.. though I still miss Shatner. When I saw the movie I decided to add it to my library and I am glad I have it. Love that it came with a digital copy.
B00CX7TOTQ|3.0|could be better, a bit slow for my taste.  Not the best films from Deniro and Travolta , but ok....
0307743721|5.0|Mistress of language and subtle storytelling.  You have the feeling that all of her characters are slightly out of control, there is a strange vertigo that feels like anything can happen at any time...Munro logic.
6304602944|5.0|I HAVE ALWAYS LIKE SYLVESTER STALLONE. THIS IS A VERY GOOD DVD. I WISHED IT DIDN'T HAVE ALL THAT BAD TALK IN IT.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I loved the Shining and couldn't wait to read this book.  Stephen King was as fantastic as ever. I will read this again and still have trouble putting it down. Thanks Stephen!
B000053V7Q|5.0|I LOVED IT. ELVIS PRESLEY IS ALWAYS GOOD. I AM A BIG FAN. THE CONDITION OF THE DVD WAS GREAT.
B00B0LPWU6|3.0|Compelling story tells about 2 very different sides of a hero. You are torn between supporting him for his heroics or scorning him for his weak character.
B005PK1G76|5.0|Fits on my BOB great, very handy, does the job.  No need to spend more...this works fine, just make sure it's emptied before folding the stroller!
B000YMM3CC|5.0|This story will make u laugh out loud & shed tears the next second.. I loved this love story! I could watch it over & over again!
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|It's OK?!?!?!?!  I am not a game expert so I can't really tell you anything except playing around means different things to different people.
B003KVKQB4|5.0|I have not read the whole book yet, but already consider it to be one of the best books written about the wrong side of capitalism, about the awful effect of neoliberalism on the life of more than half of the human race. As soon as I finish this, I shall definitely purchase another book of her. I wish she could read my Anti capitalism written in Hungarian. How about learning Hungarian, Naomi?
B006OCM0G0|3.0|It's OK?!?!?!?!  I am not a game expert so I can't really tell you anything except playing around means different things to different people.
B005LAIIN0|5.0|Arrived fast, and undamaged. I think the movie was great with new effects. a little scary with fast running zombies, but mostly action drama.
B009O2XY12|3.0|It's OK?!?!?!?!  I am not a game expert so I can't really tell you anything except playing around means different things to different people.
B001DZ9GRE|3.0|Love it, just wish the dvd would play all the videos rather than having to click play one at a time.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|I learned a personal story from a time period I have read about before.  The combination of the many generations and their intertwining history made for a touching read. Very enjoyable, but I want to read about their life together in New York.  I am sure they will relocate to a new country and make a new life.
0312611692|5.0|I highly recommend this book because:<br /><br />1.Regarding the past: it provides the reader with a good historical perspective about the conditions required for success. It is exceptionally thorough about comparing China to the western countries. I prefer the comparison provided by David Landes in his book titled \\"The Wealth and Poverty of Nations\\", however.<br />2.Regarding the future: it develops some interesting models. It describes \\"Singularity\\" the time (25 years from now?) when computers (artificial intelligence) will be smarter than we are and should be awesome partners for making the world better. It also describes \\"Nightfall\\" a time when life could get much worse.<br />3.One indication of the value of this book is the quality of the 110 reviews already written on Amazon.com. I find it interesting that some of the better reviews were written by people who live in Australia and others who live in Hong Kong.
B0055PMJMW|4.0|These short stories were very much  in line with all previous Bosch works. They were interesting, had plot twists and satisfying conclusions. I highly recommend this book.
0984725113|5.0|This book is important to me for the following reasons:<br /><br />1. It predicts the future in a way that seems plausible. It says that we are in the early stages of the “third industrial revolution”. The first was caused by the invention of the steam engine. The second was caused the inventions of the telegraph and the vacuum tube.<br />2. It identifies some of the barriers to our making progress. One is the loss of self esteem for those who are unable or unwilling to participate in making the revolution happen. Another is our antiquated education system.<br />3. It validates some of the optimistic predictions of the following book: “Abundance”, by Peter Diamandis (which include almost eliminating hunger and disease in the world within 25 years).
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I read all 3 books in succession over 2days. Couldn't get enough. There were a number of ways that the story could have unfolded, but c'est la vie. Although the final book was disappointing, the first two were so good that I would recommend the series just for them.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|I give this a 3 out of 5 because it is great for road trips cause I don't have WiFi then and lots of games like this require WiFi any more. But also it is just a game with flaw but still a pretty darn good one
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I haven't read a Grisham novel in a while.  What was I thinking? So glad I picked up this book. A riveting read. Grisham has another great tale worth your time.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Very fast, overclock capable.  Low power consumption and runs very cool.  Comes with stock fan but I used a Zalman cooler.
B007R11DKQ|5.0|The story is well established and very good foster the message.very good play.<br />Robert DeNIro very good player.<br />sienna miller and charlie cox both had nice make up.
B0062OCNAI|5.0|Amazing. I started this yesterday afternoon and did  not sleep until I had finished it. Wonderful book. Great story. So incredible.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|One of the best books I've read. A page turner from start go finish. Romantic suspenseful, and entertaining. Would love my own Christian Grey.
B000B5OD4I|5.0|Great value for money on a timeless design.<br /><br />Got stopped by a work colleague the other day commenting that the watch reminded him of his grandfather he had an almost identical watch.<br /><br />The 7R26 is a real workhorse. My luck wasn't as great because this movement wasn't as accurate as the one I have in my black monster. But still it runs about 1 minute fast after one week of constant wear (not &#34;rested&#34; on any funny angles overnight to attempt correction), which I consider pretty impressive in a sub-$200 watch.<br /><br />The jubilee bracelet can seem a little flimsy watching people play with it, but really actually sits very nicely on the wrist; it is both lightweight and offers a secure feel.<br /><br />Bezel turned nicely and easily. 120 clicks.
B004P2HMNM|5.0|So far the best modular in terms of playability. Lots of details and my daughter was fascinated by the petshop and she liked the animals like the dog, cat, fish, etc. Indeed a classic set!!

B008NB0SQO|5.0|Delightfully fun.  This is a quirky spin on the Christmas Carol movies/books but quite moving and fun.  I bought it for my kids years ago, but watch it as an adult every year.  I appreciate the creative minds that developed such a tale that you can enjoy a pig and a frog telling the tale of the ghosts of Christmas present, past and future!
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Have received lots of requests to play this game from Facebook friends and finally decided to try it.  It's much like other simulation games like farmville but different enough too. Really like the graphics and characters.
B000OZ0NXA|2.0|This book had some great twists and interests, but was way to graphic in descriptions for my taste.  I understand the author writes many a tale that can keep your interest--this one I read per a friends' urging and enjoyed the story-line; however, just felt sick to my stomach for the gore.
B00C2UUDMG|3.0|Michael Connolly rarely puts a foot wrong and this offering is slick, fast-paced and -as ever- well written. But it lacked a little depth, particularly with regard to Mickey Haller's character. Really, he was just a name rather than a person, and was rather vague and insubstantial. The plot was ok but the killer's motive, in the end, was even thinner than the Haller persona. Enjoyable but not up there with his best.
B00867GHS8|5.0|Delightful and quirky.  Who would guess we would be entertained by a red and a blue fish and have all the emotions of real-life flow through us by watching a cartoon.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book was extremely moving and an important book for all people to experience!!!  As a retired teacher, I would suggest it as a book to be read in middle schools all over the country!
B005LAII3U|5.0|What an exciting, energetic, imaginative story this is!  It is not the least bit like the old Total Recall played by Arnold S.  The story is fresh and mind-bending.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|I love the quality and the songs are so fun to listen to! One of the best purchases I've made in a while.
B000VZO3KM|5.0|i love this album - it has some great songs - have had it on tape for a long time since i discovered john hiatt.<br />had to hear it again after seeing him in person recently, downloaded it since the tapes are inaccessible<br />right now.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Good building game.  Moves through levels quickly and very easy to learn.  Looking  forward to earning more levels and buildings.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|Lady Gaga's new opus.<br />GENERAL MOOD: madness, desperation. SIGNIFICANT THEMES: sex, drugs. IMPRESSION: fast-paced, intense, manic. PRODUCTION: techno, buzz, tight, few blank spaces. INNOVATIONS: loose song structure, staggering variety of vocal styles, parental advisory. MUSICAL DIFFERENCE FROM PREVIOUS ALBUMS: mainly in production details rather than overall direction.<br /><br />\\"Aura\\": mystery, Middle Eastern influence. \\"Do you want to see the girl who lives behind the aura?\\"<br />\\"Venus\\": metaphor for sexual love. Other planets mentioned include \\"Jupitah\\".<br />\\"G.U.Y.\\": gender-bender.<br />\\"Jewels N' Drugs\\": Gaga wants drugs n' love, not jewels n' money. Guest rappers' desires are a little more complex. \\"Ain't no rules, play dirtay man.\\"<br />\\"Do What U Want\\": racy duet with R. Kelly.<br /><br />\\"ARTPOP\\" - most noticeably different track. Best track. Techno effect sounds like the inside of an old mainframe computer. Vocal calm in comparison. \\"ARTPOP could mean anything/I try to sell myself/But I am really laughing/Because I just love the music/Not the bling.\\"<br /> \\"Swine\\": worst track. Nasty and unpleasant as the title indicates. Very inexplicable sound effect, used twice.<br /><br />\\"Donatella\\" and \\"Fashion!\\": similar subject matter, similar sound.<br />\\"Mary Jane Holland\\": extreme shifts in style. Meaning? Grass, easily obtainable and very tolerated in Holland.<br />\\"Dope\\": exaggeratedly theatrical piano ballad. B#%ch with a habit, on her last leg.<br />\\"Gypsy\\": most conventional track, an anthem, like \\"Edge Of Glory\\", praising life on the road.<br /><br />\\"Applause\\": \\"Pop culture was in art/Now art's in pop culture in me.\\"<br /><br />I give her my applause. Buy ARTPOP. You'll love it.
B00455IVHU|5.0|Original storyline and great cast - I love Babs! This is by far the best romantic comedy out there. You'll laugh, you'll cry. They just don't make movies like this anymore. A must see. In my case, a must see over and over again!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Great product at a great price. You will find yourself hard pressed to find a streaming device that can do as much as this device at this price point. It will do Pandora, HBO GO, Hulu Plus, Netflix, Youtube, Google Play Movies, Google Play Music, and last but not least cast a chrome browser to the TV.<br /><br />The product is very simple to setup and takes maybe 10 minutes. Use the chromecast app on your mobile device to setup works great. For Netflix I find that it has the best way to search movies if you use the phone app for Netflix select movie you want the play to chromecast device. Much better than clunky blue-ray interfaces! Same with youtube, it is so easy to search on mobile device then just select cast to device! I imagine as time goes we will get much more app support.<br /><br />I use mine plugged into my AV Receiver powered by receiver usb port and it works wonderfully.

B00ECU2RGY|3.0|Paying extra for HD on a streaming service is dumb.  The resolution is a function of the bandwidth.  Save the $1
B0067EKY7M|5.0|A beautiful story ~ with flawless actors.  I don't think there's any movie  the two main characters could do that wouldn't be wonderful.  Such a sweet and uplifting movie.  I loved it!
B0012QRPU4|5.0|About half way through S1 and am loving it! Keeps me on the edge of my seat. My only complaint is that I am TOO addicted.
B00GH4RKYM|2.0|Christopher Nolan's penchant for making &#34;dark&#34; superheroes comes through loud and clear here. But unlike the Dark Knight series, there is nothing &#34;dark&#34; about superman. The movie has tremendous special effects and sound, but that's it. Even with a bevy of &#34;super&#34; actors, the dialogs and story line was a flop for me.  Perry is weak, Jor el was unbelievable, and Lois role was completely miswritten. . You cannot &#34;darken&#34; superman. For me episode II of Christopher Reeve on which this movie is based on was more humane and representative of the amazing story of Siegel and Schuster.
B009SJ3H8Q|4.0|Interesting plot, good acting, can't go wrong with Jessica Lange. Show had a decent ending with no cliffhangers. Very good.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|you get to use every hunting gun you  dreamd of.) this game is so much fun. I reccummendn this for every hunter.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|What can I say. This wakes me up every day!! I love it and glad I got it. Great app and it is easy to use.
B008NCSZQ8|2.0|The movie was as expected full of good action sequences, however the crappy plot and acting were overpowering. We simply didn't ever care to see the finish.
B004YXE438|5.0|This is a fun app. The puzzles were cool and a range of skill levels. I had fun playing this app. You should try it.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Easy to use, loads quickly, nice layout. Also like that it stores multiple locations to easily go back and forth between locations.

0385537131|5.0|As a lawyer I found this novel very interesting. It was somewhat difficult to keep track of all the characters, but otherwise it is well-written.
B00B5HQLMI|2.0|This Bond episode bordered on the absurd, not so much from a special effects view point, but the story line never seemed well-defined, and did not end soon enough.  An aging James Bond is resurrected throughout this visual tome.  \\"M\\" is also aging.  One last cliché:  The heroine Bond counterpart was revealed as Miss Moneypenny in the end.  Deja-vu, all over again, as Yogi B would say.  Acting was well done, but the material and plot left much to be desired.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Awesome game have a lot of fun playing it and meeting new friends at the same time.<br />I highly recommend playing .
B006TF6WAM|4.0|This truly absorbing but sad story is packed full of life's truisms and moral calls, with lots of interesting characters. It is gentle and simply written, making for a quality read. Maybe not everyone's cup of tea, but it was mine!
B00GNK18X4|5.0|IT IS AN AMAZING ALBUM!!!! One Direction has switched up their sound a bit and are no longer the bubblegum pop boyband. They have a more rock sound and its more sexy and mature.
B00AA0TJO8|1.0|I don't hate this game but I bought it and it won't let me play! I want someone to do something about it because I'm really mad!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is very interesting because the other minion's help one minion get across the other side. I also like when Gru makes a little video in the beginning of the game. I think you should get this game!
006202406X|4.0|I enjoyed this whole series. However, this last book had a different feel to it than the others. Some may dislike the ending, but it was realistic and true to the characters as they had been developed throughout the story. I took a star off because I felt like the resolution was a little simplistic, I had some questions that were not answered. Nevertheless, I enjoyed how Veronica gave some time for closure and left you with hope for the future.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally glad I can play this on my kindle. Love how it's easy to navigate and I can send and request lives. I'm yelling back and forth with my family. I need another life.

B001N44BW0|5.0|This is one of the best movies by Leonardo Dicaprio as it gets so intense and keeps you guessing all the way through. I have been looking to find this movie and then saw it on amazon, a great find.
B009JBZH54|5.0|WHAT CAN I SAY , THIS WAS THE BEST BATMAN EVER . ALL THREE MOVIES CAPTURE STRENGTH AND PAIN OF BEING THE BATMAN .
B0002V7OI8|5.0|A great movie, I love it and have been trying to find for a while. It plays well and the price was right.
B004ULNJF8|3.0|IT WAS JUST OKAY . I LIKE JASON STATHAM A LOT BUT THIS WAS NOT ONE OF HIS BETTER MOVIES .
B00DHHWXYY|3.0|This is a really odd interpretation of a great story. The music is all wrong. The colors are cartoony. The acting is exaggerated. ...Well, everything is exaggerated. Nothing has a real feel at all. The story is essentially about shallow people, but even Gatsby, who is supposed to be the hero, loves what is on the surface. The only realistic character is the narrator. Still, with such a solid story it's hard to go wrong. The movie feels long, but when I got to the end, I felt the emptiness that the characters were projecting all along so I guess it makes its point in an unpleasant way. Not knocking it. The story is about unpleasantness  so it works.<br /><br />If you like it, check out the Robert Redford version. I think you will find it more satisfying. Well, if you DIDN'T like it, I'd stick with the same advice. It's toned down but still makes its points. And it's Redford, not DiCaprio trying to be Redford.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|I WATCHED EACH MOVIE OVER AGAIN . I WAS ABLE TO GET A CLEARER UNDRSTANDING OF A OF A LOT OF THE<br />THEMES IN THE MOVIE . MUCH BETTER PICTURE THAN DVD .
B000JSDPUU|5.0|An unusual character.  An escape for the man who is trapped in this world's idea of what materialistic goals that define us.  The Ads we see on TV that describe the possessions are necessary to be happy.  How little we need to live.

B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This app is awesome! It is so much fun. It really think everyone should get it. I love it a lot.
B0045D3N3O|5.0|Beautiful blu-ray picture quality for a classic, must-see movie about an icon-- whatever your own politics.  It's never looked better!  Denzell Washington and Angela Bassett in top-rate performances; really, this is true for everyone in this great film.<br /><br />Spike Lee, in speaking before each deleted scene in the extras, shows himself to be a bit inarticulate-- as every time he discussed the Egyption Sphinx, he kept mispronouncing it as \\"Spinks.\\"  As he seems to be a boxing fan, it sounded exactly like the last name of the famous boxing brothers, Leon and Michael Spinks.  Hey Spike, it's pronounced \\"Sfinx.\\"<br /><br />He is also speaking off the cuff into the camera, which to me showed laziness and unpreparedness on his part, as I've never seen someone on a blu-ray or DVD extra seem so unprofessional as to do this.  Nonetheless, you're getting this disc for the movie, which is one of the great ones, in my opinion.<br /><br />Plus there is lots of high-quality, glossy, informative artwork within the \\"book\\".  A wonderful product all-around.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|10/10 Overall<br /><br />Great app, especially to pass the time. I would recommend this to  everybody. At first glance you can see the amazing graphics. Then comes the sound with great clarity and depth. But my favorite part of this app is the variety of instruments you can pick from and the ability to search for other musical pieces, not only classical.
B001AQO446|5.0|Beautiful blu-ray picture quality and sound quality, really a top job.<br /><br />The film speaks for itself-- it's different alright.  And I always have liked it!  A comedy with Belushi and Aykroyd in their primes, also with numerous musical legends, and a silly, contrived, but wholly enjoyable story.<br /><br />A wonderful blu-ray.
B0012NVGHU|5.0|This is such a good and true movie.  It's s simple and real story.  There's love without sex or violence.<br />The music is pure and outstanding.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Five stars are needed this twisted love story is a book I could not put down. I have been in awww sense day one.
B00BATG18K|5.0|I am searching for words to express my love for this book. If only I had Amy Tan's gifts!  The resolute spirits of her female characters prove to be endemic  of the resolve to survive demonstrated by Chinese women throughout history. They are truly the strength of China and America is fortunate to have so many of China's daughters. Every reader will surely find enjoyment, knowledge and optimism in this exceptional novel.  Dr. Linda Lawrence
B009UX2YAC|3.0|this is a good game.but if it would stop stopping in the middle of the game that would be great. and when I got the update won my phone it stopped working please fix.

B001H4NXCK|5.0|My husband loves James Garner movies, Support Your Local Sheriff and Support Your Local Gunfighter.  It isn't easy to find an entertaining movie that has a good plot and humor.
B00GD9F59S|5.0|First off, absolutely love this series of books.  All the books have kept me on the edge of my seat and drooling for the next one to come out.  This book does not disappoint!  Highly recommend!
B00902AKK4|4.0|After playing the game few times, you really begin to like this game. This is not so meant bird clone or a temple run clone that makes it a new experience for the users. The game is well made and the tutorials are good to learn the basics. The controls are basic and had no problems with them. I also did love the music accompanying the game which made me like the game even more.<br /><br /> All in all a fun game to play for both kids and adults who like some fun games .
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Engaging, well-written, deep, these are just three of the words I would use to describe this awesome book! I find myself totally enchanted by the depth of the world being created, and craving more of the story being spin.<br /><br />You will not regret purchasing this book. It is an instant classic.
B00E7SXPVW|4.0|I love the styling of the disks, but I don't love the contents. This of course has nothing to do with the seller. It came promptly and in the new condition I bought it in.
B0010T0OCY|5.0|&#34;Dark City&#34; is an interesting scifi film with a twist ending- which although wasn't completely unexpected, was stil worth the wait. It was a very enjoyable film, and I am surprised I never heard of it until I saw it here on Prime. It's extremely watchable, and I enjoyed the special effects and the story line. I can't say that it is truly original, as there are some elements borrowed from authors like John Christopher and Ray Bradbury, among others, and some of its themes were borrowed for movies like &#34;The Matrix&#34;. There are some parallels the two have with each other, leading me to believe that &#34;The Matrix&#34; and &#34;Dark City&#34; may have been twin sons of different mothers. Taking that into account, the presentation is original, and it is well worth the watch. Wasn't really sure about Keifer Sutherland's acting in the film, until his character is explained later on. The rest of the cast does very well, and the story line is pretty fluid. I feel like there could actually be a sequel made for this film, and if it is in the same thematic style would do very well. The story is believable, and I would recommend it to many of my friends, even to the point of watching it again. 5 stars from me, and I don't do that often.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I like Minecraft but I wish it had Redstone,Villagers,Wolves,Caves,Monster Spawners,Nether,End, Aether,flint and steel on creative and privelages.My name is Ryker Baughman and I love Minecraft but I wish it had a update Thanks Mojang For Making this App. :~]&Acirc;&raquo;.<br /><br />  Thank you - From Ryker ;=)  5 stars I say
B00DHBOQMM|5.0|Two words come to mind, intriguing and suspenseful. Michael Connelly is truly a master of his craft. From numerous strands he has woven the fabric that became one of the most gripping courtroom dramas I have read. I could not put it down!<br />'The Gods of Guilt' comes with my highest recommendation.
B00GIXWXEO|5.0|Turbo was absolutely hilarious.  We watched it for family movie night with our 5 children (ages 20 months to 10 years) and every single one of them enjoyed every minute of it.  Additionally my husband and I were thoroughly entertained as well.  We'd HIGHLY recommend it to anyone, kids or not :)
B00GO95TAC|1.0|I was going to buy it for my mom to watch it later today after dinner.. BUT NO! The price hike is too much.. so good day to you, Amazon..
B00821PCJS|4.0|Great sci fi story telling.  I enjoy this more than the Revolution series.  The story build up really well with a purpose and reaction against the alien invasion.  Great series.  Hope it would continue.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Very limited to what can be streamed, also when it's working it's very choppy and laggy when playing videos, I hate that you have to use compatible apps or programs instead of the typical hdmi plug where what's on the computer shows up on screen, this is not the case, has to use supported programs or won't work and right now only a few programs will work
B00FAI2IUM|5.0|I cant believe how realistic the graphics are. its like an actual platform racing game for the ps3or xbox360. this is the best.
B002QKZLZ6|5.0|I had seen a host of conflicting reviews - some loved it/others hated it - on this product, but I found it to be perfect.  The materials used in the case are of good quality, the construction of it was appropriate for the price AND it had the belt clip and magnetic closure that so many people complained it was lacking.  Not sure if there are multiple suppliers of this case or what could have caused the disparity in reviews, but I'm pleased - finally something to protect my Voyager Pro headset while it's in my well-traveled backpack other than the mini-Crown Royal &#34;velvet bag&#34; I had been using to &#34;sort of&#34; protect it.
B009NF54ZE|2.0|Kind of lame and simple, no real challenge, script is bland, didnt give it less because st leadt they tried
B00G21XNKU|5.0|Well done; engaging, fun and satisfying. The doctors are interesting and surprising as usual. The visuals and sound were quite good and added to the excellent acting.
B00EYE0ECW|5.0|Have to have this. Its the best!!! I use all a lot of Google products and plan to continue. Thanks Google!!!
B00B5HQL50|5.0|Best Bond flick...maybe ever! Smart script, good updating of a legend without throwing away what makes the legend cool. Just wish they had a better guy cast as the lead. I'm sure I'll probably be in the minority, but he is just not James Bond to me.
B009NF54ZE|5.0|This is great game I found it absorbing and entertaining  I had fun with this game.<br />If you enjoy search puzzles with a little touch of other types of puzzles then this is the game for you.
B004SUWR2C|3.0|I like this game &#34;OK&#34;. It seems that either I never played Uno right or there are more rules than there used to be. I feel like the game plays itself.
0553579908|5.0|Welcome back to another world of glory, power, war, love, betrayal, and lies. Unlike how &#34;A Game of Thrones&#34; began, you know 90% of the characters and almost all of the major locations. The first book left readers off with a cliffhanger of the formation of alliances, kings, and hostages, with people ready to fight for the Iron Throne. Now, it's time for preparation, negotiations, and most of all, war, all in approximately 1,000 pages, if you somewhat include the appendix (which is amazing if you begin to forget the characters or their importance). Personally, I loved it better than the first because now that I'm adjusted to Martin's imagination and plot course, I can allow myself to expect or at least anticipate what might happen. We begin to see a more split up realm where people and families are separated, and everybody is essentially on their own. You never know who will die and who will survive, so keep that in mind when reading. At some points, you will begin to question whether or not whatever a character is doing is important to the plot. Most of the time, whatever people are doing, it's important. Maybe 2% of people's actions can be irrelevant, but try your best not to forget certain things because there are a lot of viewpoints in this story! Overall, just kick back, relax, and have a good time reading what happens and who will conquer and who will fall.
B008NMT684|5.0|My son loves the puzzle apps by this company. He plays them almost daily, even if it is only for a short period of time. A great investment.

B00FJ7YDV6|4.0|I really like this app since it is a book with games as well. My son though could care less about the book portion. He seems to like the games occasionally.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|awesome game I love it I should play this more than I usually do I love it I love it I love it I love it
B008QMMEOE|5.0|My three year old loves all the puzzle games by this company. He plays them daily. He plays them often enough that he has some of the puzzles memorized.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|really fun game<br />I really enjoyed playing Candy Crush & the fact that the game is free makes it great. I loved playing it.
B00F2362IE|4.0|My son and I both have enjoyed playing this game, but we can't seem to figure out how to get past level one. We always get captured by aliens. It's still cool though.
B00DV9QHB8|5.0|Well...I have been listening to this recent release by Lang Lang for some months by now.<br />It does not require any 'review', really: let aficionados do the job.<br />My gut reaction is that the pianist, the conductor and the orchestra had all the notes (there are aplenty) of these two technically gigantic pieces thrown at the right direction.<br />Some 'reviewer' say that these post-Romantic works have 'no soul', so the performers do not require to be soulful in their performances...I don't know what this means, really. May be the romantic and classical 'soul' is a different thing from 'modern' souls in classical music.<br />Granted there is such difference, I still could not figure out why these music could have 'no soul', so I can only be reduced to say that if the notes are wrongly directed, the two pieces could not have come out in any appealing way.<br />Here, the ensemble did a splendid job.<br />I tend to feel a certain amount of 'soul' in Bartok's music - the Slavic and rustic soul. I would have thought that Lang Lang could bring this aspect out to the forefront. Here, he only brought out about 90 to 95 percent of it. May be it is Rattle and the Berliners that have the reign. I still prefer the two Hungarians Anda and Fricsay in this Bartok concerto No. 2.<br />I am not Russian, so I do not know if the Prokofiev No. 3 concerto is to be considered 'authentically interpreted'. However, the sheer musicality of this rendition is enough to appeal to any listener.<br />So, soulful or souless, 5 stars for the great collaboration.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This book kept me awake for two nights, but it was all worth it. The plot was good. Grammar and sentences were not particularly good in certain instances which might be due to translation. Overall, this is a book one will never be disappointed reading.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting forever for the ability to play candy crush on my Kindle it's the only game I haven't gotten tired of I love love love it  FINALLY!
B00CB4ET0K|3.0|Game is fun, controls a bit clunky. Frustrating because they want you to buy credits. Sell the game, providing full access for a fair price, don't nickel and dime us to death.
B000FCK65W|5.0|I loved this book, but at over 500 pages, it is not for the impatient reader. The descriptions are incredibly detailed. The characters wonderfully portrayed. Even the most minor of players is sympathetically portrayed such that you feel you would recognize them and wish them well. I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes to take their time to savor a good read.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Very good read with a interesting ending.  Keeps your interest and turning the pages.  Keeps you thinking as you read.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Grisham does it again! Great read and terrific sub plots. Hard to put down and<br /> He keeps the reader guessing where the next twist is. Love it.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|For a free game it's always timing me out at different levels and then asking me to purchase more &#34;Lives&#34; on line before I can progress or to re-play a level. It's annoying.
B000B8L6LI|5.0|I purchased this set in addition to a course and sapphire stones the system as a whole is great, especially for people who have the patience but not necessarily a guru handy to teach you the ancient arts of wet stone sharpening. Others on here can attest to just how sharp you can get even a cheap, dull knife with a little time and diligence.<br /><br />The point of my review is to highlight how superb Lansky's customer service is. I've had my stones for about a year now and recently noticed some of them had developed hairline cracks in the plastic where the screw tightens. Not a big deal, but one was starting to grow to the point where I could no longer tighten it all the way. I emailed Lansky, they said no prob; just send them in and they'd happily replace them. Well, I didn't mention it the first time but I'm in Canada, and the postage to send my set to NY was nearly the cost of replacing the stones. I mentioned this and asked if I could send photos instead. She said absolutely (I spoke with the same person through the entire process,) I emailed the photos right there and my new stones are on their way. Took less than a day for all those emails and she genuinely came across as pleased that they could make things right. For an item as affordable as this, one can't expect too much grief when something breaks, but they blew me away with their commitment (lifetime warranty) to their product. If my set wears again I will be happily buying a new one, just to support a good thing.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|I have read it many times, and it  always gives me the feeling of<br />reading about real carácters who reflect  all de virtues and shortcomings of us people in every walk of life.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I could not put this book down. I had to finish reading the book from beginning to end, in one and a half days. Picoult really gets you hooked and makes you keep wondering what is going to happen next. Best book I have read in a while.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|The ending is not my usual preference but the characters stories were well told! It is a story that makes you think about choices!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I like this game because it is fun and collect bananaz if I could I would give This game 11 stars.  It is fun and easy to play and all people that are reading this that play Temple Run it will be super easy for you.
B009UMTMKS|5.0|Proves an MBA student never stops learning after graduation.  Added this book to my professional library.<br /><br />Valuable insight for any new business initiative
B00G6ZTM3Y|4.0|While it is certainly fun, the controls are not ideal. They are the best for the platform though, at least I can't think of a better scheme.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|om double g<br />this game is insane its so fun when you sneak attack on people then eat them!<br />besides that the game is great there are some negative stuff about it to<br />like you cant go so deep in the sea to find food or explore<br />but other than that it is a great game
B005L38QK2|5.0|Absolutely fantastic mouse, if it were a little larger it would be perfect. Sometimes I hit the right side buttons with my pinky finger but it's happening less frequently.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|It is fun becuse you got a challenge u got to do i like challenges some times so i think u guys will relly enjoy this game i hope u guys have fun with it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!-!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0063IH60K|2.0|I wouldn't say &#34;I didn't like it&#34; exactly, it was a fun game, but I had to erase it from my Kindle after about a week because it would not start correctly.
B00AEBBAEU|4.0|It's Daniel Day Lewis.  What more do you need to know?  Looking forward to watching it in my favorite theater - my basement.
B00942Y35S|4.0|It´s a refreshing approach of an old topic. The importance of loving yourself just as you are. The magic is on you...
0307352153|3.0|I had a mixed reaction to this book.  As a confirmed introvert I was excited when this book first appeared.  At last there would be a public discussion about our core cultural values that favor action over thought, form over substance, and noise over quiet.  To be fair, maybe the problem is mine, in that I  expected a different book than the one Susan Cain actually wrote.<br /><br />On the positive side, Cain does provide a highly readable and well researched account of the psychology of introversion.  For me, the most fascinating part of the book was her summary of the research of Jerome Kagan, who identified two opposite poles of infant behavior, which he labeled &#34;high reactive&#34; and &#34;low reactive&#34;.  Cain gives a concise and lucid explanation of the link between these two inborn temperaments and introversion and extroversion.  She also develops the useful distinction between &#34;temperament&#34;, which is inborn and exclusively nature, and &#34;personality&#34; which emerges from the combination of temperament and culture, in other words, nature plus nurture.  For introverts like myself Cain offers a readable, non-technical understanding of the source of our often-criticized &#34;shyness&#34; and &#34;aloofness&#34;, along with an exploration of the positives of this kind of personality.<br /><br />What I didn't like about the book was that there were far too many accounts, well-intentioned I'm sure, about introverts who made it in an extrovert's world, particularly by learning effective public speaking.  Perhaps she wishes to pass on tips of what enabled her to thrive, in spite of her introverted personality, at a place like Harvard Business School.  For myself I would not dream of putting myself in such an environment. I do not see this as an obstacle to overcome.  At times the book reads almost like a self-help manual.  Although the examples of Moses, Eleanor Roosevelt, Mahatma Gandhi, and Steve Wozniak (and many other high achievers cited by Cain) are intended to be encouraging, I actually found the cumulative effect  curiously depressing.  The message seemed to be that introversion did not have to be an obstacle to success, at least for highly gifted individuals.<br /><br />Cain's discussion of the subculture of Asian-Americans was interesting and suggestive of the more penetrating discussion that I expected of American cultural norms.  Unlike Asian cultures, ours gives status and rewards to the &#34;cool kids&#34; and &#34;jocks&#34;, not to the &#34;nerds&#34; or &#34;geeks&#34;. In world in which skilled and sophisticated thinking is becoming increasingly critical to success, both personal and national, this would have been a topic well worth further development.<br /><br />If I could I'd give this book an extra half-star.  Although it didn't completely satisfy me, I think it is a valuable start to consciousness-raising about the positive side of introversion.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is so fun. It is challenging but not to much that it's confusing. The only bad thing is... I WANT MORE LEVELS!!!!! Other than that you should definitely GET this game.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I enjoyed this series very much. I've read the books twice and catch new plots in them each time. The movies are great but the books are fantastic!
B00008OWZC|5.0|Felt like being at a concert.  Good sound quality.  Page's playing was superb and Plant's vocals are unmatched live.  Great!
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Never thought I would be into a Zombie movie! But my husband & I are both Hooked on The Walking Dead. The storyline has been very captivating.
B00GNK18X4|5.0|One Direction has come a long way from 2011.From 'What Makes You Beautiful' to Midnight  Memories is a  huge transition. I personally think this album is more mature than Take Me Home and Up All Night.I like the edgy pop rock feel to their songs..My personal favorites are Midnight Memories,Little White Lies ,and Alive.Just to name a few. Anyone who is a One Direction fan should definitely give this a listen.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I thought this book was a great addition to this series...I was upset at the end when it seemed that my favorite character is murdered.  However, I enjoyed the journey...
B00FEMJF6O|2.0|geez zynga where do i start...oh right here will be good ... first off the game play is kool.. graphics are ok ... BUT there is no way to discard  unwanted items that will not sell ... you can't remove an item from the seatrade... also the shops will not buy them so you are stuck with items nobody wants and like i said you cannot discard them...what gives ... i cannot make room for more important ones... and don't get me started on the crowns... free game? yeah right.. wouldn't be so bad if they weren't so expensive... and whats up with the wheel of fortune... lol  should make it a crown of fortune... cause thats what they cost... i started this game and was like &quot;yay a game i finally like&quot;... but you guys ruined it.so now it's back to tbe app store for yet more searching for a game thats not a pocket emptier... oh and by the way up until this review i was having some sleepless nights...if you know what i mean... better luck next time... back to gameloft.............
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I love it. It is very realistic and entertaining. I've had it for two days and I already love it. Download it. You won't regret it.
B00006FDCD|5.0|Id been looking for this movie for a long time and finally came to the take a chance and see if I could fund it in Amazon for of and luckily I found it
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Great movie! Good story, lots of suspense and action and the touch of romance was just enough but not too much.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Love it, love it , love it! Everyone should own it. I actually got tipped off buy my kids. Th a n is guys.
B00GLX0Z8C|5.0|This film was a riot, almost constant laughing throughout the entire time.<br />The credits show some funny stuff too. You have to see this movie.
B00BATG18K|5.0|Almost done reading it, and like much of Tan's other work, I'm both hankering for the end and dreading it. I have it on Kindle, and I am devouring it.<br /><br />Tan writes with a clarity that is sparkling as well as cutting. Her descriptions here of the later section of Violet's life do leave you squirming, but as always, the voice of the author convinces you that it's worth moving forward with your reading.<br /><br />The way the stories evolve and revolve around each other is something that fills me with envy: I wish I could write like that! However, we have Ms. Tan to write these stories, and I for one am grateful.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Excellent moving, very suspensful, kept you on your toes the whole time they were hunting, great boy gets girl in the end, it appears. Very entertaining.
B00EMIE0CA|4.0|I've been a Spyro fan since the 80's, and have nearly every CD, (except the compilations). This is a very welcome mix of<br />styles from the band, and everyone seems to be in top playing form, despite all the years that have passed. I'd give this review<br />five stars had it not been for the recording quality. In most cases Spyro Gyra recordings have been pretty clean, with levels set<br />accurately and an overall great sound. However this particular recording, in a new venue, with new engineers....definitely has<br />something to be desired. Trust me.....I'm not an audiophile snob, but I do have a pretty nice set up. I think I'm able to tell when<br />the problem isn't with me or my system . ( In this case I actually tried to make adjustments to render the sound more accurately).<br />  Overall the engineering isn't bad, but for some reason Jay Beckenstein's sax seems levelled way to high, and when the entire<br />band is jamming at full strength.... the sound is just, well....distorted. It's a bit fuzzy and not well defined. And with today's excellent<br />recording equipment, etc.  there's just no reason that should be the case. ( I guess it's a bit more evident on headphones that it<br />is through speakers, but it's evident none the less.)  So, bottom line for me is, the music is just fine.....but the recording could use<br />some fine tuning. But certainly don't let that stop you from enjoying new stuff from one of the longest lasting &#34;smooth jazz / pop<br />jazz&#34; bands to ever exsist.
B00BAXFJ5M|5.0|David Baldacci did again ! A must read , you just can't put it down.  Can't wait for King and Maxwell to return
B00DFBY1CE|5.0|This is a great blues/rock experience. KWS is awesome on guitar, as usual, w/o overpowering the excellent band and vocals. This does justice to several covers and has some great original tracks.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|It was a good series. Love the movie. Go watch it. Making me do this review is stupid. Thank you
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|the extra 3 moves don't work. ever. and if ya'll fix that id love it but alas it doesnt work so i just like it
B00DU74U74|5.0|WOW! This movie blow me away. I love the idea behind it, the acting is great. It was action, romance, thrill and so much more. The directing is great and I liked the movie so much I read the book. If you are looking for something fun and in the mood for romance action and a crazy out of this world story. Pick this movie!
B00BEF1AEK|3.0|I like the game, but I get no sound or music on my Nexus 7 (music and sound are set to be on, I did check). I haven't come across any reviews of anyone else having the same problem, but if anyone knows a fix please let me know!
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Kind of fun to be able to go back in time, just not change the future.  The butterfly effect is in full swing with this book.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|its a really good game.entertaining but hard don't think its a easy game.was watching the neverending story while playing so I am all good
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Wonderful characters, great scenery, humor, emotion...this has it all!  I am so looking forward to season 4 (and more). If you enjoy historical dramas, you will like this program.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a fun game. I can never get enough. My kids play it, my husband plays it. Fun for the whole family.
B007RV5S9I|4.0|Pina Bausch was a remarkable artist and a great mentor. That comes through loud and clear as her students share their stories through dance of how she affected their lives.This movie is a must for anyone who loves to dance or just appreciate it like me, but be warned. It is a highly personal and moving experience and may have you looking for an instructor like Pina to bring forth your latent talents.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Grisham is in a class by himself. When I start one of his books, I can't put it down. But then I don't want it to end. He brings you in and makes you feel like you are part of the story. Please keep writing!!!!!!!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Nice little gadget. Particularly impressed with image and software quality. After I discover how to play videos from my laptop, I tried to cast my desktop without any issues... Great Product
B008LXZEYU|1.0|A couple of laughs, but mostly a long version of the worst of Saturday Night Live, where they confuse &#34;annoying&#34; with &#34;funny.&#34;
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Not as action packed as the usual 007 movies goes, but a good movie. A balance of drama and action.
B0089XH38M|2.0|I got it for my kindle when it started acting glitchy. It ran and said no problems found, my problems went away, except that the program itself would freeze up my kindle and not work every time I turned on the device. I removed it and everything has been fine. Need to fix the freeze/lockup stuff for kindle fires.
B004QKNXIQ|4.0|SAW THIS IN THE THEATRE AND ENJOYED IT...CUTE AND PREDICTABLE PRINCE/PRINCESS FILM<br />LIKED THE CHARACTERS....WATCHED IT TWICE MORE WITH MY 3 YEAR OLD GRANDCHILD AND<br />THAT'S IS OFTEN ENOUGH...GREAT LITTLE GIRL MOVIE
0810989956|5.0|My son like reading the Wimpy Kid books so thought he might enjoy having this one,<br /> its a present so can't say much, but will update later on .
B005MLP71Y|4.0|I LIKED THIS...NOT AS GOOD AS THE MOVIE &#34;UP&#34; WHICH I WATCHED PRIOR..<br />STORY WAS OK...CHARACTERS OK...GREAT FOR FAMILY ENTERTAINMENT
B00BEF1AEK|1.0|It was a fun game up until I cleared everything but the last square and it lost all my data and returned me to the first square with just a couple levels complete. It also needs a better way to exit than having to press Home.
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|STARTED TO WATCH THIS...I GUESS I'M JUST NOT INTO THIS KIND OF HUMOR<br />TEENAGE BOYS WOULD PROBABLY FIND IT FUNNY
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Easily lost myself in the emotions connected to each character. The whole series has been the best i have ever read. The love and pain are explained in such a way you believe it to be real. Truly a classic to be remembered forever.
B003U6BE8I|4.0|IT WAS AN ENJOYABLE QUICK PACED FILM...GREAT FOR YOUN VIEWERS<br />DON'T FEEL A NEED TO WATCH IT TWICE BUT I WILL WATCH THE SEQUEL
B00BAXFJ5M|5.0|You will have to use a book stand or a well insulated iPad to read this book! It is too hot to hold!
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|GOOD FAMILY ENTERTAINMENT BUT NOT FOR THE REALLY YOUNG KIDS...THEY WOULDN'T GET IT<br />NICE STORY, LIKEABLE CHARACTERS...TOTALLY NEW SPIN ON THE STORY
1423140605|5.0|Purchased this book for my daughter who has loved the Heroes of Olympus Series.  She is really liking the series and all books written by Rick Riordan
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I MISSED THE SERIES ON TV AND STARTED WATCHING ON MY KINDLE AFTER SURGERY<br />AND I GOT HOOKED. WATCHED ALL THE SEASONS..LOVED ALL THE CHARACTERS...THERE ARE GOOD GUYS AND BAD GUYS<br />JUST A GREAT STORY...CAN'T WAIT FOR IT TO RETURN TO TV
193700788X|4.0|I have read all of the books in this series and I must say I am glad I continued, but am sad to see them end.  I found this book to be exactly what it was meant to be...a book that wraps up almost everything that has been going on in this entire series.  It also was the only book of the entire series that I can say you really needed to have read the other books to fully understand.  There were lots of past references that you only could understand completely if you have read the other books.  I did enjoy this book, but at the same time I can see why some people may have not liked it.  I found that I didn't like some of the endings to some things, but that doesn't mean I hated the book.  The book was well written and just as interesting as any other book that Harris wrote, in my opinion.  This was a book full of &#34;what?!&#34; moments for me.  I wouldn't call it a bad book, I would call it a &#34;not what I had expected&#34; book.  This book wraps up many things with the characters and where they are going in their lives and relationships.  As I read it, I really could feel the &#34;end of a series&#34; feel to the book.  I just felt the ending of it all through the writing.  I liked the book and am glad I read it.  Did I love it like the other books in this series?  Maybe not, but it was worth the read.  I would recommend reading this book if you have read the rest of the series or many of the books in this series, so you can put some &#34;closure&#34; to things in the way of Sookie Stackhouse.  It surely has the adventure, drama, and trouble that follows Sookie!<br /><br />4/5 Stars
B00GT4V5DM|5.0|Malwarebytes is the best. I have tried many different anti-malware tools, and none of them work as good as Malwarebytes.
B004X6PRO6|4.0|I loved the way the author digs deep into perspective and experience and how they shape behavior.  I wanted a little more from the end of the book, but overall this is a great read.
B00DVKOYBM|5.0|Troy's game and I love it. lots of fun and it is not hideous. recommend it highly. get this game.
0316098329|5.0|I can't believe that I haven't reviewed this book! Normally when I love books like I love this one, I've practically written the review before I've finished reading the book!<br /><br />Room is one the best books I've read this year. The whole story is told from the viewpoint of a boy who is born into captivity. His mother was abducted when she was in college, and she spends her life protecting him from the truth of their dire situation.<br /><br />To this boy, Room is all that he knows. He and his mother play various games all day. The way in which this woman copes with her circumstances amazes me.
B00CGPPMKU|5.0|I bought this app for my toddler, two at the time, and it is such a beautiful and easy way for her to color with a twist. I'm sure I'm not the only one who remembers the Spirograph (I think it is called) from childhood. This is fun. I recommend it for other parents/their kids wanting something pretty and fun.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Yahoo is now being used not just at home but anywhere I go and not having to take my laptop with me.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|I don't play a lot of games on my devices. In fact, if you stalk my reviews, you'll see I'm usually buying games for my toddler's Kindle. This game was incredibly addictive, however. My husband and I each played it quite a bit, with completely different strategies, and still did very well and enjoyed it a lot. My toddler also loved this game, and it was definitely a little confusing for her, but she figured it out and found it delightful. If you like D&D, adventure RPGs, and other nerdy stuff, you'll probably enjoy this game. Bonus points for the pixelated (but clear) graphics, as I find them charming.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This was one of the best escape games I've played. I do wish it were longer though. 10 levels is too n short.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Good game, but a little too confusing for my two-year old. She still loves how pretty it is and that it has her favorite characters.
B00B69UQEO|4.0|Life-long DM fan - this said, the album is OK, but by far not their best effort.  I will say that this grows on you after more listens.  The lead single, Heaven, should've been held back, and the lead single should've been Soothe My Soul, an excellent track.  I'd still recommend a buy on this...
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|A fabulous story with excellent acting and rich sets.  The acting is superb and each episode is engaging.  A wonderful escape!
B00G6ZTM3Y|2.0|this is actually terraria but there are many bugs. sometimes when equipping armor, it deletes it, if you summon a boss, it takes the item away and doesn't summon it, my world became corrupted after the game crashed, and there are random screen glitches (different colored lines appear for no reason at all) and fall damage doesn't seem to be scaled correctly.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|For an app, fairly well put together.  One of the better apps for a large company in my opinion.  Not had a problem using this app for whatever purpose.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|After watching the documentary on Rodriguez, I wanted to own a bit of his music. I was not dissapointed. This is an excellent addition to my music library. It's funny how these songs stand the test of time. It also amazes me to think that we as the public totally wiffed when it first came out.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|Ridiculous that in this day and age with all the apps available, Candy Crush makes you wait anywhere from 12 minutes to 30 minutes to resume play if you fail at one of it's levels.  I have never seen such nonsense.  Agreed that it can be addicting, BUT to have to wait to continue play because you failed 1-3 times is just ridiculous in my opinion.  And turns you off to playing at all.  I refuse to pay for a game just to reach another level.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I don't cry very easily but this book made me cry a little. It is sad but it's really good. Just read it. Okay? Okay.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|For a free calculator it is nicely sized and I do use it frequently.  Large to see and swipe numbers easily.
B00GLX1MG6|5.0|Best new movie I've seen in a long time, hilarious!  It's raunchy in a very good way.  I am hoping to age like Jennifer Aniston..wowza!  That lady is fearless.  Great casting, both kids and adults.  Funny & entertaining.  We will definitely watch it again.
B005K17RU0|5.0|My favorite weather app.  Opens easily and gives a lot of info regarding weather from hourly to 10 days out.  5 Stars!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game really makes me think! It is fun and addictive. I love all the colors. It is fun to see what will appear on each new step. I recommend it.
B0058YZK2G|5.0|The product is perfect, the material, the quality, the colors, everithing is perfect.<br />We dont have this kind of shoes in brasil, thats the only problem
0345529057|5.0|Halfway through the series after watching the first two seasons of the HBO series. I adore the storytelling and depth each character has. I enjoy these books far more than many of the books I have picked up in the last few years so I am very happy I made the purchase. I would recommend these to anyone who enjoys fantasy books, or even just fiction. My only contention is that parts of the book are a bit dry, though honestly it's just like everyday life where sometimes things are a bit boring. Overall, a wonderful read.<br /><br />Edit: I gave up. The monotony didn't get any better. I've been told that describing minor characters/animals in detail is part and parcel of this type of fantasy genre, but I can't handle it. I'm so glad this became a show because the story itself is amazing. It's also suspect if the books will ever actually end and I'd hate to get into it and never have an ending!
B00FVZJYK6|5.0|I loved this movie.  Great for kids and adults. Really well done and smart.  So funny - I spit popcorn more than once!
B004LSJCJM|5.0|awesome blues..Joe Bonamassa is a profound, gifted musician who plays and sings with his whole heart..Jesus is the reason for living...blessings
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|A very cool product for watching shows and movies. Got my Breaking Bad fix with this baby. Just sit back and transmit from your laptop!
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|I enjoyed the setting particularly the time frame when race relations were at a standstill.  That point was well<br />portrayed as the South was stubborn to change and old habits hard to change; but John Grisham's plots  and endings are<br />beginning to be predictable.
B00EDY5KTA|3.0|the songs are beautiful, but they don't really work well together. the reviews for the movie say it's the best thing since the lion king... but.. music wise? I don't think so. like I said the music is lovely, but they don't follow together in a way that even match's how the lion king's music came together. also most of the music on both the disk's are music, no words.

B00EJU8ZIG|5.0|good songs - can't believe this girl is only 14! Several other good songs on this album. Got it for &#34;Royals&#34; but pleasantly surprised at  many other good songs on the album.
0439813786|5.0|Wonderful children's book.  Purchased as a requirement for a class in early education, this book is now taking a place in my library for sharing with my family.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|I am a Lady Gaga fan so I like this album. I really like the duet with R. Kelly (do what you want with my body). They sound great together. The rest is so-so compared to her last three albums. Not dance tracks. I kept up with sneak peaks at &#34;Artpop&#34; on youtube and was sad to see that &#34;Stache&#34; &#34;Burqua&#34; and about 10 others that were leaked as possible tracks didn't show up here. This stuff on this album reminds me of what she played at a keyboard in clubs before she was famous. I prefer the dance music diva she has refined into on songs like Just Dance, Pparazzi, Bad Romance, and Judas.  I like her as an artist so I bought Artpop because it was not getting good press. I did find &#34;Stache&#34; which is an amazing song on DJ Zedd's &#34;Clarity&#34; cd. Glad to have found that. But cannot find: &#34;Radioactive&#34;, &#34;PoshPuss&#34;, &#34;Tea&#34;, &#34;Poison&#34; (ft. Beyoncé), &#34;Kickdrum&#34;, or &#34;Stuck on f#@+* you&#34;. Those would have made this a #1 album no question. I guess she had some creative differences with the record label. Get back with Akon and do your own thing Lady. This album  clearly had too many chefs in the kitchen to be true to the mama monster vision.  Seems like you were muzzled.

0553801473|5.0|Amazing book and tv series. This book is a little bit review but also gets into what else will happen after where the series ended last season. I look forward to the next book(s) and to see how this all turns out. Who will end up ruling from the iron throne? I am rooting for the Mother of Dragons. I bought the hardback and it is BIG.

B00BSBR9N6|4.0|This book is so different. It is told from the perspective of a gentleman with Asperger's, but he doesn't realize he has it. A very entertaining and touching story.
B00GHJ6BJW|5.0|I just received this album on vinyl, and wanted to write a review for that particular purchase, but Amazon doesn't allow customers to write a separate review for each different format in which they purchase music and movies, but instead lumps them all together in one big category.  I don't really like that they don't allow customers to write a separate review for a vinyl edition, which has its own attributes that an mp3 download or cd would not have, so that is why I've chosen to update the review already left.<br /><br />The album cover of Artpop is truly amazing, and one of the most beautiful album covers I've ever bought.  It has the same foil used on the limited edition cd cover that they are selling here at Amazon, and the cover art is even MORE beautiful in this larger format.  The double gatefold has the Terry Richardson portrait inside showing him photographing the Lady.  Also, the sound on vinyl is truly earsplitting...listen to it LOUD.  I actually heard instrumentation at the very start of the album that I hadn't heard listening to it on cd in my car, and through earbuds from my mp3 player.  It's a sonic boom of a feast for your ears on vinyl!!<br /><br />Lady Gaga is an amazing artist.  I don't like everything about her, but she really does have an unbridled talent as a songwriter and performer.  Watching her iTunes Festival performance, I found myself growing irritated with her persona.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah....the banter with her audience grew tiresome and sounded contrived at times, but man, when she opened her mouth to sing, I was utterly blown away.  I'm pleased to say that Artpop does not disappoint.  It probably, as a whole, is my favorite album of hers to date.  I've loved cuts from her previous efforts, but think that this album is possibly the most cohesive of them all.  I really love<br />\\"Aura\\", \\"G.U.Y.\\", \\"Sexxx Dreams\\", \\"Manicure\\", \\"Do What You Want\\", \\"Artpop\\", \\"Swine\\", and even \\"Applause\\", which I've admittedly had to warm up to.  That's a pretty amazing number of songs to absolutely love from one album, imho!!<br /><br />Having watched the Lady's performance at iTunes festival, I was certainly anticipating Artpop.  What a bold move performing all new songs at that concert!  I watched it in toto, and then again in pieces, several times while they still had it available for streaming, and totally fell in love with the songs before the album dropped.  I was very interested in hearing how much like, or different the studio versions would be from the live performances from that show.  The one criticism that I have of the album is the song \\"Dope\\" which I believe was reimagined as an ode to her fans at the concert performance, as a song called, \\"I Want To Be With You\\", which is a much superior song in my estimation.  I imagine the album was already in the can by the time of the concert, so I'm assuming that was the order of things, and not the other way around, but I'm really not sure. At any rate, I just feel that the album cut is lyrically inferior, and it's stripped down, spare, and raw. While I understand the gritty studio version, I think the vocal in concert was much better, and the song brought out the sweetness in Gaga's voice, making for an emotional, powerhouse performance.  The lyrics for the album cut are about addiction, interestingly, especially in light of the fact that fame, and her relationship to her fans, would appear to be another of her addictions, so the song still has relevance to her fan base.  (I sometimes wonder if she really means if when she says, \\"I live for the applause...!!\\")  Anyway, it is one small caveat that I'll just have to live with, and does little to detract from my love of the album.  I'm really hoping that she releases the other version at some point, because I'd really love to have it.  I thought it was the best song in the set she performed--just her and a piano, haunting and beautiful.<br /><br />I can't say I really understand people's hatred for Lady Gaga.  Yes, she can be irritating and grating at times, but then, can't we all?  She's only 27 years old!! She's still finding her way in the world...  Some people don't seem to give her any slack for mistakes she's making along the way, and it's sad.  We all have different things about us--sharp edges that rub other people the wrong way--but I think it's always good to try and look at the big picture when dealing with anyone.  Does she have more positive to outweigh the negative?  I like to think so....ga.  Yes, she can be irritating and grating at times, but then, can't we all?  She's only 27 years old!!

B0060MYM7O|5.0|This is a fantastic series. It really brings the books to life. The characters are intriguing and well played. Even if you've read the books (which you should), the show is phenomenal.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I ripped through this book--and loved every chapter, every page, along the way.  I alternated between reading it when home and listening to (the very well performed) Audible book during my commute.<br /><br />It's not often that I am able to stumble across a book--I have so many waiting on my shelves to read, and receive so many recommendations from friends and podcasts alike, that I very rarely find myself blindly browsing Amazon.  But when I received notification that Amazon was now offering a break on Kindle editions for books purchased through them, I went out specifically looking for a title I didn't already own, saw the rave reviews for Wool, along with the plug from Justin Cronin (having devoured The Passage and The Twelve), I pulled the trigger.<br /><br />I love all sorts of Sci Fi, and dystopian post-apocalyptic is a particular sweet spot, so given that, and then Howey's incredible attention to building a fully lived-in and fleshed-out reality, and I was hooked.  Great characters, stellar pacing, thrilling twists--so much fun! Can't recommend it highly enough!<br /><br />And can I also just say how much fun it is to know there are already sequels out there waiting for me?!  Hooray!
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is everything a weather App (or any App) should be for that matter -<br /><br />1) Great metrics and weather data<br />2) Accurate and spot on (I live in 07310 area code)<br />3) Great presentation and notification<br />4) Free !!!<br /><br />The hourly forecast is fantastic via panels that you can keep flipping. Ton of other info very neatly arranged<br /><br />I have an Android 4.1 smartphone - love it on that phone<br /><br />Run to install it !!!

B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This story will stay with me for a long time. The love that Augustus and Hazel shared is truly captivating even in the face of the terribleness of cancer. Excellent read and I highly recommend.
B0060MYM3S|1.0|This rating is not about the actual shows and story line. It is about the physical product itself. I first thought it was my DVD player and actually bought a new one. However, it is not the DVD player but the manufacturer of the DVD sets. Apparently, HBO went bottom of the barrel because through the first pass through seasons 1 & 2, the DVDs started to skip and scratch. I am very careful with my boxed sets so it has to be the materials. I am not longer watching them now. The packaging itself is low quality as well. The plastic dvd holders popped off the card board folders.<br /><br />Maybe, HBO has made better supply chain choices. This is no fault to Amazon. You are probably better off using online streaming and cloud based shows.
B008D36INE|3.0|On paper this version of Rattigan's classic looked to have the right ingredients - a visually brilliant director and a top-notch cast.  However it turns out to be a disappointment.  This is chiefly due to a lack of sympathy with the characters: we do not really understand why Hester Collyer (Rachel Weisz) should feel as she does, while Tom Hiddleston as Freddie Page is badly miscast.  He seems to be under the impression that shouting will reveal the character's inadequacies.  Simon Russell Beale is quite good as Hester's husband, but even he doesn't really have much to do.  The film also represents an uneasy mix of Davies' and Rattigan's concerns; there are new musical sequences inserted (for example, a scene in a local pub, and a flashback to wartime London) which have strong echoes of Davies' earlier work (THE LONG DAY CLOSES comes to mind), but which deflect attention away from Rattigan's character-driven piece.  Weisz does what she can with the material, but in the end we do not really care what happens to her.
B0058EBNAO|4.0|I picked up this app a couple years ago when it was the FAOTD. It was buggy at the time so I uninstalled and moved on. A couple months ago while looking at my app list on the cloud I decided to give it another shot.<br />Superb. So far my all time favorite weather app. It has come a long way. Always accurate and up to date.
B003RV43X4|1.0|This film pales in comparison to the original. From the acting to the animation, it just really fell short. I didn't know what to expect and I even had a glimmer of hope as I think Sam is a great actor. But from the editing to the sound mixing the film really came up short.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So happy this available for kindle fire now...waiting for so long.  Love it love it love it!  We are all hooked on candy crush love it love it.
B006GECE9Y|2.0|Buggy and obviously in need of some professional help. Bought it to enable Flash content on my iPad. Don't bother.
B000PAAH3K|5.0|Really enjoyed the examples, and also combed through the endnotes. It's very well researched. Seems like pop psychobabble but really much better argued than that.
B00BAXFJ5M|5.0|King and Maxwell again come to the top of the pile to help someone in trouble.  This time a teenager, Tyler Wingo, is wanting to hire them to help find out what really happened to his father.  His dad, Sam Wingo, is supposedly KIA in Afghanistan.  Tyler doesn't believe it.<br /><br />As it turns out Sam Wingo appears to have been set up to take the fall for a theft of 1 billion dollars from the U.S. Government.  This money was going to go to pay insurgents to stage a coup to topple a Middle Eastern government.  Who set Sam up?  Why does the Army think he is dead?  Is he really dead or just running for his life?  Should King and Maxwell get involved?<br /><br />OK, I have read the other reviews.  I'm a bit surprised by the one star reviews, but people are entitled to their opinions.<br /><br />Here is my opinion.  Baldacci is back in style.  The last King and Maxwell wasn't my favorite book, but in this book I think that Baldacci has hit on all thrusters.  The plot is engaging.  The corruption of our government is believable.  The corruption of the crooks is believable and the fact that different government agencies appear to have different information makes it even more believable.<br /><br />The characters are well developed.  The scenario's are well developed.  Maybe the only big issue is the fact that King and Maxwell seem to be surviving all attempts at getting them killed.  Really, can any two people be that lucky?  Can two people be that good to always come out on top?<br /><br />Well, regardless of that, it wouldn't be a series of novels to love if the hero's got killed off.  So, it's not surprising that they survive.  But will others survive?  The new characters that are written in you grow to care about quickly.  There's Tyler Wingo, his friend Kathy Burnett, and then there is Edgar the computer hack intelligence analyst.  These people are in danger, will they survive?  Who knows. Well, actually I do because I finished the book.  Let me just say this, not everyone comes out alive.<br /><br />The story is engaging.  It will keep you turning pages.  King and Maxwell are a smart and savvy pair of private investigators.  It's a shame that the government got rid of them, they would do the Secret Service proud.<br /><br />I loved the book and trust that you will enjoy it as well.veryone comes out alive.<br /><br />The story is engaging.

B0070UFMOW|5.0|I feel stupid that it took me so long to invest in one of these.  I've owned some high end headphones: Shure SE 110, SE 220, SE 530 and now SE 535 and SRH 840.  As expected, these help drive the bigger SRH 840's.  It's pretty obvious that they benefit from the power.  I was surprised to see how much of a difference it made with the SE 535 in ear monitors.  A lot of reviews said they didn't need an am because they are small and very efficient, but they are wrong.  I have a significant difference and always use the E17 when I'm using either headphone.  I love that it charges via USB when I use the on-board DAC.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is wonderful for the family to bond over and it is really fun because you have to focus on what to do.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I cantvuse enough words to explain how I feel about this game. I seriously am addicted to it!! love love love it!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I really love this book we could see the war from both sides. And being a true story you could bank on it. I would give it a five star reading. I'm looking for more books like this.
B000GOWNPU|5.0|The message and overall impact is worthy of seeing. Just to understand what can happen to disobedient children along with brutal punisemt no one should suffer. The characters really outdid themselves in this movie!
0399165274|4.0|Excelent story. Realistic background and lots of actual information. Above all, a very good and riveting reading, in line with Forsyth magnificent style and quality.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Got for my granddaughter I love it. Is a little hard for young kids!  Disney for kids??????? Should have age requirement.
B000OY8NII|5.0|Something for everyone. Even my non-geek friends like it. Funny and smart, and very fun to watch. Not for the serious scientist though
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Terrific video and audio transfer of one of my favorite film series.  (It's still a trilogy in my mind, but I don't mind having all of the movies together in such a comprehensive, compact and well produced package).  I think that the Raiders of the Lost Ark video transfer is not as good as the other films in the set.  That's unfortunate because it's my favorite of the films.  It is understandable because it is also the oldest movie with the lowest budget.  Having said that, it is still the best that I've ever seen the film looking and sounding (that's coming from someone who has owned versions of that movie on vhs, laserdisc and dvd).  Each of the subsequent sequels looks better than the last.  Top notch hi-def video and audio, as to be expected from a THX certified box-set.  Definitely a must-own!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|If you something to grip your emotions from happy to sad in the same paragraph, but yet keep you reading and hungry for more, this is it!  What a ride.  The characters truly keep to form, and the twists and turns in the end make so much sense, considering how each person is.  Even the end, which is as odd ball as they come, fits right in, and is actually all you can expect from the girl, literally on fire.  What a story.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|Best available video and sound quality of one of my favorite series.  Excellent set of extra features, all in one compact package.  For people who were disappointed in the Matrix sequels, I highly recommend giving them a shot while listening to the bonus audio track featuring Professor Cornell West.  It helps to provide some context and insight into the philosophical references in the script, the plot and what the film makers were shooting for.  I was initially disappointed in the 2 sequels because I really enjoyed the first film and through of so many directions that they could have taken to the story to go deeper into elements of the Matrix world (that didn't center around Neo and Trinity).  With that said, I felt like I was sitting in an extremely fascinating college course while watching the movies.  I walked away feeling educated, enlightened and with a greater appreciation for all of the films (especially for the sequels).  I got more than I bargained for with this feature.  Must-own for fans of the series. Really pleased with the hi-def transfer and the added value of the extras.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Quality game. Still playing five months later. Good if yor five or forty. This one will not be deleted.<br /><br />Jumps, running,  special gifts, goals
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|An excellent read. I mostly read in the suspense\crime thriller genre, so Stephen King is not an author I read much. But this is a really excellent story. The characters are really well-thought out and developed. They will grow on you and stick with you over time.  It takes a little time to get all the pieces of the story in place, but then it really grabs onto you. Good page turner!
B004XVMCMQ|4.0|I love the book Mansfield Park, but it is so nuanced that it would be very difficult to capture it in a motion picture.  This one created a new Fanny for us who is feisty rather than faltering.  It is an interesting interpretation of a story but not even trying to introduce us to the Fanny of the book.
B004SIP6BI|5.0|Simply charming.  Well acted,  beautifully photographed, stunning settings, and a musical score that can stand alone as a masterpiece.  Our movie library is richer for this purchase and would not be complete without it.  My wife and I both love this sensual delicacy.
1592402038|5.0|Even though I have spent my entire life suffering with a lousy education in grammar and punctuation (thank-you public schools), I really enjoyed and learned a lot from this book. I was actually able to read a book on punctuation without falling asleep!
B0094BB4TW|3.0|The Kindle version doesn't update to the most recent version but it works for the basic FB use just fine.
B00BAXFJ5M|1.0|This story is not well written. The plot is very borning and story is not keeping me reading. David has done better!
B008AK8FHM|1.0|big scam.  There's no proof.  There's nothing but an author that wants to cash it in because he's a doctor...?  Oh, okay.  I believe you.  Your a doctor.  Sorry you died, but more sorry you died and came back to write this sensational, shallow book.
0553593714|4.0|Deep characters with many plot twists! For those who loved the hobbit and lord of the rings this is a good read
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Very interesting portrayal of a very interesting man.  At first it's hard to overcome the early impression that Jobs was a real ass, but as you experience the events of his life and how he thought, you come to realize that he was really more of an artist in temperment that some tech geek or super salesman.  You do see how he was able to leave others behind without much concern (Woz) but it seemed in the end nothing was ever about the money, but then in certain situations it was all about the money.  Very complex, weird person.  Clearly, if you met him you wouldn't like him and he had a tendency to bully many other people throughout his life.  He was also reluctant to give credit to others when credit was due.  Interesting insights into his relationship with Gates or others in the film and computer industry (Disney, Intel, Oracle).  Big alpha dog that never saw fit to give to others in any way other than his little sleek gadgets.  The author did a great job with the facts, interviews, writing so that you really don't want to put this book down it flows so well.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Not great writing by any means but I don't read it for it's literary value.  Sex scenes do it for me.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I read this a long time ago, well before any movie plans and I liked it back then.  Very imaginative story, with a well thought out plot, characters and details.  I have not seen the movie, but I guarrantee you this is better.  I had to stretch a little bit since science fiction is only a sometime thing for me, but I got my handles on this one early and rode it all the way without any slow downs, and I'm glad I took the ride.  Forget the movie and get this game started for real...
B008602KQI|5.0|Loved it.  Not too bloody.  Old fashioned cowboy movie theme.  The moral of the story: &#34;The good guys always win.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|Good app. Map could be a little faster when loading. Animation takes a long time to display. Map laggy once loaded. Otherwise good app, I use app everyday for forecast.

B003UESJJC|5.0|This set has EVERYTHING a fan of this movie could ask for -except for the lack of Bob Peak's classic poster as the cover art. People who didn't want the amazing documentary, &#34;Hearts of Darkness&#34;, (the must-have companion movie) got treated to that. Other than that, Coppola's commentary is fantastic and so are his conversations with Martin Sheen and John Millius.
0307591549|5.0|Well-done, Shawn. I have listened to the book twice on audio and bought the paperback to make sure I capture all the great references. I have printed out key points from the book and have them above my computer at work and on my mirror at home.<br /><br />I NEVER do that!<br /><br />This book has caused me to take look at habits and happiness from a better perspective. Having read and listened to Charles Duhigg's &#34;The Power of Habit&#34;, Baumeister's &#34;Willpower&#34; and reams of material on habit and addiction, plus the stories of dozens of people who have met and overcome hardship, I find the principles both consistent with my related studies, but also compelling because of the different angle I discovered here.<br /><br />The book is well-written. Shawn Achor keeps the language understandable, explains the research and findings in non-academic terms and outlines processes for internalizing the principles.<br /><br />I hope to succeed in developing more habits of the habits that will enable me to be more positive and happy, and assist others in accomplishing the same. I have found applications for parenting, grandparenting, giving community service and function more effectively in my workplace.
B008N9AAQ4|5.0|This movie doesn't tell a story but reminds me that amazing sights and sounds are some of my favorite things to get out of a movie. Simply gorgeous.

B00BMKH5NW|4.0|This was very good. I'm always the cheesy one who wants an epilogue to see where the love birds are.
B009NF54ZE|5.0|Love the games from Microsoft, and this one does not disappoint.  A great sequel to the first pirate adventure.  Great puzzles, good story line.  Great entertainment
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|This is a great game with interesting graphics and beautiful scenery. The time it takes is sometimes tedious but overall a fantastic fantasy.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|My husband read this and loved it.  He is quite selective in his reading, but this one held his interest to the end.  On the other hand, I started it but put it down after a few chapters.  Somehow I found it to be tedious reading.  The 5 stars reflect my husband's evaluation.
B000FC13MM|5.0|The plot manages to be one of the typical fantasy construct as well as one that doesn't fail to surprise. The book is well written, the scary parts actually building suspense and fright, and the view of magic is very unique and creative. The characters are realistic and well written, the entirety of the book there is sly humor and almost a sarcastic tone towards some of the characters. Also, the book is the best I have read in terms of the realism of choices. The heroine is forced to make many difficult choices and each has consequences both positive and negative because neither is perfect. Overall, a great book that I would definitely recommend.
B000MAOLVW|4.0|Typical of movies from that time when you go back and watch them 30 or 40 years later. Still some of the best real racing scenes ever filmed. The car sounds are spot on and seeing the suspension working at speed was some great cinematography. Great racing scenes. The story line so so.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I loved this book. One of the best reading experiences I've ever had. It is inspiring and has plenty of action. The Navy SEALS are an awesome group and Adam Brown exemplifies what they are all about. The book follows Adam's life, both good and bad, until his death on a mission in Afghanistan. A must read for almost anyone.
B004HW7JMO|5.0|What a great series, I truly hated to see it end. The story of men treated as animals and literally having to fight for their lives.
B00EQ0CKRQ|4.0|The graphics, audio,music and single player gameplay are great but the multiplayer system needs to be updated to force players on an even playing field since you can't see what the other players are driving your only option is to not do multiplayer until you either spend $100 for the ultimate car pack or play the entire game through once to unlock the best car in the game with credits since you can most likely assume that your going up an s class car
B00FQMZ5M0|4.0|My kids really enjoy this movie and there's lots of flying action.  My kids favorite scenes are the jets on the aircraft carrier and Dusty racing against Ripslinger and his thugs.
